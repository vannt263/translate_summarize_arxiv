    "the weyl asymptotic formula for the counting function @xmath2 for the eigenvalues @xmath3 of @xmath4 on a compact manifold @xmath5 ( with or without boundary ) states that @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a constant depending on the dimension @xmath8 of @xmath5 .",
    "there are more precise statements such as @xmath9 for manifolds without boundary or with smooth boundary , and @xmath10 for manifolds with non - smooth boundary of minkowski dimension @xmath11 [ l ] .    in the case of laplacians on fractals ,",
    "the situation is more complicated .",
    "for example , for the sierpinski gasket ( @xmath12 ) with either dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions , the analogous statement is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a multiplicatively periodic function @xmath15 that is bounded away from zero , and discontinuous ( hence non - constant ) .",
    "this was first observed by fukushima and shima [ fs ] based on a precise description of the spectrum .",
    "it was later put into a wider context by kigami and lapidus [ kl ] based on the reneval theorem . using a refinement of the reneval theorem , kigami",
    "[ k1 ] showed that the error is bounded , @xmath16 note that this is consistent with the fact that the boundary of @xmath12 consists of three points , hence has dimension zero .",
    "similarly , the explanation for the value of @xmath17 is that @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the dimension of @xmath12 in the resistance metric and @xmath20 is the order of the laplacian [ s2 ] .",
    "we already see that ( 1.7 ) is stronger than ( 1.3 ) .",
    "the point of this note is that even more is true ; we can have an exact formula with no remainder term at all , provided we restrict attention to almost every @xmath1 .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath21 denote the double cover of @xmath12 ( two copies glued together at corresponding boundary points ) .",
    "then @xmath21 is an example of a fractafold without boundary [ s1 ] .",
    "neumann eigenfunctions on @xmath12 extended evenly to @xmath21 and dirichlet eigenfunctions on @xmath12 extend oddly to @xmath21 give a complete set of eigenfunctions on @xmath21 .",
    "in particular @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote the eigenvalue counting function on @xmath21 , and @xmath12 with neumann or dirichlet boundary conditions , respectively .    * theorem * : _ there exists an open set @xmath26 whose complement has measure zero , with @xmath27 , such that for each @xmath28 there exists @xmath29 such that _ @xmath30 _ for all @xmath31 , and @xmath14 is continuous on @xmath32 . also _",

    "our proof is based on the `` spectral decimation '' description of the spectrum from [ fs ] .",
    "it seems likely that a similar result holds for many pcf fractals for which spectral decimation is valid ( [ sh ] , [ b - t ] ) , but this would require a different proof .",
    "it is straightforward to extend the result to all fractafolds without boundary based on @xmath12 [ s1 ] .",
    "it is instructive to compare our result with the case of the second derivative on an interval . to be specific ,",
    "consider the interval @xmath36 $ ] with dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "the eigenvalues are the perfect squares and @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "then we have @xmath38 exactly when @xmath1 is a perfect square , so @xmath39 for all @xmath1 of the form @xmath40 for @xmath41 .",
    "thus the analog of the set @xmath32 is a countable dense set .",
    "this is not the first example of a result in fractal analysis that is stronger than the corresponding result in classical analysis ( see [ s3 ] for convergence of fourier series , and also [ bk ] , [ bs ] , [ s5 ] ) .",
    "we hope it will not be the last example .",
    "the reader is referred to the books [ k2 ] and [ s4 ] for any undefined notation .",
    "we review briefly the structure of the spectrum for @xmath21 and @xmath12 with dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions ( [ fs ] , [ grs ] , [ s1 ] , [ s4 ] ) .",
    "the lowest eigenvalue is of course zero , corresponding to the constant eigenfunction , and this occurs with multiplying one for @xmath21 and @xmath12 with neumann boundary conditions .",
    "after that , the eigenvalues arrange themselves in cycles @xmath42 .",
    "each cycle contains ten of distinct eigenvalues .",
    "the eigenvalues and their multiplicities in a cycle are shown in table 1 .",
    "we factor out the powers of @xmath43 to write uniquely @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a nonnegative integer and @xmath46 a positive integer .",
    "there are increasing families of primitive eigenvalues @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 for @xmath50 .",
    "the upper index denotes the eigenvalue of the graph laplacian of the restriction of the corresponding eigenfunctions to the nine element graph @xmath51 of one approximating @xmath21 ( figure 2.1 ) .",

    "note that @xmath53 .",
    "the last column gives the difference of the eigenvalue counting functions @xmath54 for @xmath1 equal to the eigenvalue .",
    "since this is a cumulative total , it needs to be justified by an induction argument .",
    "note that @xmath55 , so the values are correct for the first cycle . since the value is 1 at the end of the first cycle , the pattern repeats at each subsequent cycle .",
    "note that we know a priori that @xmath56 because the boundary of @xmath12 consists of three points , , and this is consistent with the values in the table .",
    "note that the multiplicities are the same for the first seven eigenvalues of each cycle , but the last three entries in the table have multiplicities that depend on the value of @xmath45 in ( 2.1 ) .",
    "we can also say explicitly what the values of the values of the primitive eigenvalues are . define    @xmath57    where @xmath58 denotes @xmath59 composed with itself @xmath60 times ( the convergence of the limit in ( 2.3 ) follows from the taylor expansion @xmath61 near @xmath62 ) .",
    "more generally , if @xmath63 is a finite sequence of @xmath64 signs , we write @xmath65 and @xmath66",
    ". then @xmath67 for @xmath68 or 5 , and @xmath69 but otherwise @xmath70 is unrestricted .",
    "therefore there are @xmath71 choices of @xmath70 with @xmath66 , and since @xmath72 is increasing and @xmath73 is decreasing it is necessary to use an unconventional ordering in order for the list ( 2.4 ) to be in increasing order .",
    "however we always have @xmath74 if @xmath75 .",
    "this follows from the estimate @xmath76 which follows from the estimate @xmath77 on @xmath78 and the fact that @xmath79 is increasing .",
    "the following is the key lemma in the proof of the theorem .",
    "note that it is really ( 1.9 ) for the special values @xmath80 .",
    "* lemma : * for any @xmath8 and @xmath45 , @xmath81    for @xmath82 it is known that @xmath83 , the total number of vertices in the level @xmath84 graph approximation @xmath85 of @xmath21 , it is easy to see in any case from the table that @xmath86 and @xmath87 we will show by induction on @xmath60 that @xmath88 and this verifies the @xmath89 case .",
    "so we assume that the result is true for @xmath90 .",
    "the argument is slightly different depending on the parity of @xmath60 , so assume first that @xmath91 is odd .",
    "then @xmath92 is even , and the induction hypothesis is @xmath93 what we need to show is @xmath94 note that on the right side of ( 2.9 ) we are counting the last eigenvalue in cycle @xmath95 ( multiplicity @xmath96 ) and the first nine eigenvalues of cycle @xmath52 ( multiplicities @xmath97 ) , so the right side of ( 2.9 ) is @xmath98 . on the left side of ( 2.9 )",
    "we are counting the last eigenvalue in cycle @xmath99 ( multiplicity @xmath100 ) , all the eigenvalues in cycle @xmath101 ( multiplicities @xmath102 ) and the first nine eigenvalues in cycle @xmath103 ( multiplicities @xmath104 ) for a total of @xmath105 .",
    "this verifies ( 2.9 ) .    finally , assume @xmath106 is even , and @xmath107 is odd .",
    "the induction hypothesis is @xmath108 @xmath109 we are counting the same eigenvalues as before but the multiplicities are different . on the right side",
    "the multiplicities are 4 and @xmath110 . on the left side",
    "the multiplicities are 10 from cycle @xmath99 , @xmath102 from cycle @xmath101 , and @xmath111 from cycle @xmath103 , for a grand total of @xmath112 .",
    "there appears to be a lot of arithmetic in this proof with no clear explanation .",
    "certainly it would be desirable to have a more conceptual proof .",
    "we consider two intervals between @xmath113 and its neighboring eigenvalues , namely @xmath114 the function @xmath115 is constant on these intervals , @xmath116 more generally , @xmath115 is constant on the intervals @xmath117 and @xmath118 for @xmath119 , namely @xmath120this uses the lemma and the fact that the multiplicity of @xmath121 is @xmath122 .",
    "this gives us ( 1.9 ) with @xmath123 on @xmath124 with @xmath125for any @xmath126 , we similarly obtain ( 1.9 ) with @xmath127 for @xmath128 with @xmath14 extended by multiplicative periodicity .",
    "we also observe from the table that ( 1.10 ) holds on the same intervals with @xmath129    now let @xmath130 . to complete the proof we have to show that the complement of @xmath32 has measure zero .",
    "we can restrict attention to the interval @xmath131 $ ] because @xmath27 .",

    "each of the intervals @xmath135 has the form @xmath136 where @xmath137 and we no longer require that @xmath138 and @xmath139 be @xmath140 ( this uses the fact that @xmath141 ) . then @xmath142 $ ] .",
    "the composition with @xmath79 is just a differentiable distortion factor , so we drop it and define @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
