    "( a handful of the original detections of hfqpos were based on combinations of observations within specific states of the source , or specific energy selections , and hence those qpos are not detected in the procedure used by * ? ? ?",

    "it has shown several hfqpos , at frequencies of 27 hz @xcite , 35 hz @xcite , 41 hz @xcite and 67 hz @xcite .",
    "besides xte j1550564 , gro j165540 , and grs 1915 + 105 , the transient source igr j170913624 has also recently shown hfqpos . in many respects this source appears to be a scaled - down version of grs 1915 + 105 @xcite , including the presence of a hfqpo at 67 hz @xcite , the same exact frequency ( within errors ) as the highest ( and strongest ) hfqpo seen in grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "one interesting aspect of the variability of a signal in general , and of the hfqpos in particular , is the possible phase lag and coherence between measurements in two different energy bands ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the phase lag is a fourier - frequency - dependent measure of the phase delay between two concurrent and correlated signals , in this case light curves of the same source , in two different energy bands .",

    "we then averaged the 16-s real and imaginary part of the fourier transform as a function of fourier frequency for each observation and each source separately .",
    "when necessary , as we did for the power density spectra , we used the average hfqpo frequency for each observation of a given source , we shifted the frequency scale of the fourier transform of each full observation to bring the frequency of the hfqpo to that average value , and we then averaged the real and imaginary parts of the fourier transforms ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* )    for each source ( except igr j170913624 ; see below ) we selected the softest energy band in table [ tab1 ] as the reference band , we calculated average cross spectra between each of the other energy bands in table [ tab1 ] and this reference band and , following the description in @xcite and @xcite , we calculated the phase lags and the fourier intrinsic coherence as a function of fourier frequency for each of the cross spectra . in the case of grs 1915",
    "+ 105 the softest band goes from channel 8 to channel 13 , whereas for the other sources the softest band starts at channel 0 ( see table [ tab1 ] ) . to be able to compare the phase lags of the 67-hz qpos in , respectively , igr j170913624 and grs 1915 + 105 , in the case of igr j170913624 we also chose the band that goes from channel 8 to channel 13 as the reference band .",
    "finally , to calculate the phase lags of the hfqpo we averaged the phase lags over a frequency interval equal to the @xmath6 of the corresponding hfqpo . formally these are the phase lags of the light curves in the two energy bands used in the calculation , over the time - scale ( the inverse of the fourier frequency ) of the hfqpo . for simplicity , in the rest of the paper we call these the phase lags of the hfqpo .",
    "dead - time driven cross talk between different energy channels induces a @xmath7 or @xmath8 phase lag in the poisson - noise dominated part of the power density spectrum . to correct for this , for each source we subtracted the cross spectrum in a frequency range well above that of the hfqpos , in which the variability was dominated by poisson noise .",
    "we confirmed that the cross spectrum in this frequency range has no significant imaginary part , as expected , and hence this procedure has no effect on the sign of the phase lags of the hfqpo ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "since the broadband noise component in black - hole ( and neutron - star ) systems can extend up to a few hundred hz ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in the range where the hfqpos in black - hole systems usually appear , we checked whether the phase lag of the qpo may be affected by the signal of this broadband component .",
    "for this , we instead subtracted the average cross spectrum of the broadband component over frequency intervals just below or above the qpo signal before we calculated the phase lags of the qpo .",
    "the measured phase lags did not change significantly when we did this compared to the case in which we subtracted the cross spectrum in the frequency range dominated by the poisson noise .",
    "the error bars of the phase lags given in this paper account for the small differences between these procedures .",
    "in figure [ fig1 ] we show for grs 1915 + 105 ( left ) and igr j170913624 ( right ) the power density spectrum ( upper panels ) and the phase - lag fourier spectrum ( lower panels ) , concentrating on the frequency range that contains the hfqpos . for the power density spectrum of grs 1915 + 105 we used the full pca band",

    "it is apparent that in grs 1915 + 105 , for this energy selection , the phase lags of the 35-hz qpo are negative , whereas those of the 67-hz qpo are positive , indicating soft and hard lags , respectively . for these two bands the phase lags of the 67-hz qpo in igr j170913624 are consistent with zero .",

    "figure [ fig4 ] shows that : ( i ) in grs 1915 + 105 the phase lags of the 67-hz qpo are hard and increase with energy , whereas the phase lags of the 35-hz qpo are soft , and their magnitude increases with energy . from this figure it is apparent that the 35-hz and the 67-hz qpos have significantly different lag spectra .",

( v ) the lag spectrum of the 450-hz qpo is similar to those of the 67-hz qpo in grs 1915 + 105 and igr j170913624 . ( vi )",
    "the lag spectra of the 300-hz qpo in gro j165540 and the 180-hz and 280-hz qpos in xte j1550564 are significantly different from those of the 67-hz qpo in grs 1915 + 105 and igr j170913624 , the 35-hz qpo in grs 1915 + 105 , and the 450-hz qpo in gro j165540 .    since the frequency of the 300-hz qpo in gro j165540 changed by @xmath5 hz among the three observations that we combined to get the lags ( see  [ obs ] ) , we also computed the phase lags of the hfqpos for the three individual observations of this source , where the qpo frequency was , respectively , @xmath17 hz , @xmath18 hz , and @xmath19 hz . in all three cases the values and the energy spectrum of the phase lags are consistent , with large error bars , with each other and with those of the combined data , and inconsistent with those of the 450-hz qpo in this source .",
    "we also calculated the intrinsic coherence of all the hfqpos using pairs of light curves in two different energy bands . except for a few combinations of energy bands , in all cases",
    "the intrinsic coherence of the hfqpos across the qpo profile is rather noisy , and consistent both with 0 or 1 ( the possible extreme values of the intrinsic coherence ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in figure [ fig5 ]",
    "we show one of the examples in which the intrinsic coherence is well - defined across the qpo profile . in that figure",
    "we plot the intrinsic coherence as a function of fourier frequency for the 35-hz and the 67-hz qpos in grs 1915 + 105 . to calculate the intrinsic coherence we used the photons in the @xmath10 kev and @xmath11 kev bands .",
    "the intrinsic coherence is well constrained ( has small error bars ) only around the frequency of the 35-hz and the 67-hz qpos . outside that range the errors increase dramatically .",
    "the other thing apparent from this figure is that the average ( across the qpo profile ) intrinsic coherence is less than 1 , although the individual measurements have in general large error bars , and are consistent with 1 . indeed , the error - weighted average of the intrinsic coherence of the 35-hz and the 67-hz qpos using these two energy bands are @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",

    "specifically , we studied the phase - lag spectrum of the 35-hz and the 67-hz qpos in grs 1915 + 1054 , the 300-hz and the 450-hz qpos in gro j165540 , the 180-hz and the 280-hz qpos in xte j1550564 , and the 67-hz qpo in igr j170913624 .    for the 67-hz qpo in grs 1915 + 105 , the 450-hz qpo in gro j165540 , and the 67-hz qpo in igr j170913624 the hard photons lag the soft ones , with the highest energy photons lagging the softest ones by up to @xmath22 rad . in the case of the 67-hz qpo in grs 1915 + 105 ,",
    "our results are consistent with those of @xcite , based on another observation of this hfqpo .",
    "these are the first measurements of the phase lags of the 35-hz qpo in grs 1915 + 105 and the hfqpos in the other three sources .",
    "the phase lags of the 35-hz in grs 1915 + 105 are negative , indicating soft lags , with the magnitude of the lags increasing with energy from @xmath23 rad at @xmath24 kev up to @xmath25 rad at @xmath26 kev . for the 300-hz qpo in gro j165540 , and the 180-hz and the 280-hz qpo in xte j1550564 , the phase lags are independent of energy , and consistent with being zero or slightly positive ( hard lags ) . in grs 1915 + 105 ,",
    "the phase - lag spectrum of the 35-hz qpo is inconsistent with that of the 67-hz qpo .",
    "similarly , the phase - lag spectrum of the 300-hz and the 450-hz qpos in gro j165540 are significantly different . on the contrary ,",
    "the phase - lag spectrum of the 180-hz and the 280-hz qpos in xte j1550564 are consistent with each other , and both are consistent with the phase - lag spectrum of the 300-hz qpo in gro j165540 .",
    "@xcite reported the detection of two simultaneous hfqpos in xte j1550564 at @xmath27 hz and @xmath17 hz .",
    "they detected the hfqpo at @xmath17 hz in each of six separate observations during the 2000 outburst of xte j1550564 , whereas the hfqpo at @xmath27 hz is only detected , albeit at a single - trial significant of @xmath28 , when they combine the six observations with the qpo at @xmath17 hz . considering the number of trials reported by @xcite ,",
    "the qpo at @xmath27 hz is only @xmath29 significant .",
    "furthermore , from the analysis of all _ rxte _ observations of xte j1550564 separately , @xcite recently showed that there is only one significant hfqpo at a time , either at @xmath30 hz or @xmath31 hz .",
    "the similarity of their phase - lag spectrum suggests that the 180-hz and the 280-hz qpo in xte j1550564 are in fact the same qpo seen at different frequencies in different observations .",
    "this idea is reinforced by the fact that in grs 1915 + 105 and gro j165540 , which show two well - identified simultaneous hfqpos , the phase - lag spectrum of the hfqpo at the highest frequency is significantly different from that of the one at the lowest frequency (  [ res ] , fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "this comparison across sources is valid if the phase - lag spectrum of the highest ( lowest ) frequency hfqpo is independent of the qpo frequency or other source parameters , like black - hole mass or spin .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , xte j1550564 displays a single hfqpo that changes frequency by @xmath32 hz over different observations ( it would not be the only case , though , since the 300-hz qpo in gro j165540 changes by @xmath5 hz as well ) , making hfqpo in black - hole systems more similar to kilohertz qpos in neutron - star systems ( see below ) .",
    "this also suggests that the lags could provide an alternative way to identify the high - frequency qpo features in galactic black - hole systems .",
    "given the frequency of the hfqpos , the observed phase lags imply maximum time lags ( in absolute value ) ranging from @xmath33 ms for the 35-hz qpo in grs 1915 + 105 , to @xmath34 ms for the 280-hz qpo in xte j1550564 and the 300-hz and the 450-hz qpo in gro j165540 , with the magnitude of the maximum time lag decreasing more or less steadily with the frequency of the qpo .",
    "the small time lags imply a light - travel - time distance of @xmath35 km , or about @xmath36 gravitational radii for a 10-@xmath37 non - rotating black hole .",
    "@xcite proposed that the @xmath38-s soft time lags seen in the active galactic nucleus 1h0707495 at a fourier frequency of @xmath39 hz are due to reflection of photons from the corona around the central black hole off the accretion disc .",
    "given the steep emissivity index inferred from the spectral fits to the time averaged spectra of this @xcite and other objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the bulk of the reflection must take place very close to the inner edge of the accretion disc .",
    "the observed hard lags of the 67-hz qpo in , respectively , grs 1915 + 105 and igr j170913624 , and the 450-hz qpo in gro j165540 cast doubt on this interpretation , assuming that the same scenario holds for galactic black - hole systems and , that in each source , one of the hfqpos reflects the keplerian frequency at the inner edge of the accretion disc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the only hfqpo in our sample that shows soft lags is the 35-hz qpo in grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "if the frequency of this qpo is the keplerian frequency at the inner edge of the accretion disc ( notice , however , that the lowest possible keplerian frequency at the innermost stable circular orbit of a @xmath40 black hole , @xcite , is @xmath41 hz ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , one would need to explain the existence of a simultaneous hfqpo still at higher frequencies , namely the 67-hz qpo in this source . on the other hand , neither the 300-hz qpo in gro j165540 , nor the 180-hz/280-hz qpo in xte j1550564 show the expected negative lags , making the scenario less likely .",
    "in the case of 1h0707495 the lags become negative at @xmath42 hz ; if the frequency at which the lags become negative is proportional to mass ( as in the case of lags produced at the inner edge of a keplerian disc ) , this frequency would be @xmath43 hz for a 10-@xmath37 black hole .",
    "this value is consistent with the frequency range of the hfqpos in gro j165540 and xte j155056 , but the time lags have the opposite sign .",
    "furthermore , the magnitude of the time lags of the hfqpos in these four systems is one to two orders of magnitude larger than the lags of 1h0707495 scaled down by the black - hole mass - ratio .",
    "the @xmath33 ms time lag of the 35-hz qpo in grs 1915 + 105 is consistent with the expected range , @xmath44 ms , from the extrapolation of the relation between soft time lags and black hole mass of @xcite for a @xmath45-@xmath37 black hole .",
    "however , the extrapolation of the relation between frequency at which the soft time lags are observed and the black - hole mass of @xcite yields frequencies below @xmath46 hz , inconsistent with those of the hfqpos in black holes .",
    "@xcite suggested that the qpo at @xmath0 hz @xcite in the narrow - line type 1 seyfert galaxy re j1034 + 396 ( see * ? ? ? * for a discussion on the significance of the qpo ) could be the counterpart , scaled down in frequency , of the 67-hz qpo in grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "however , the phase lags of the qpo in re j1034 + 396 are soft and become softer as the energy increases @xcite , whereas the lags of the 67-hz qpo in grs 1915 + 105 are hard and become harder as energy increases .",
    "our results rule out that identification , unless the lag spectrum can switch from hard to soft as the mass of the central black hole decreases by a factor of @xmath47 .",
    "in fact , the lag spectrum of the qpo in re j1034 + 396 is very similar to that of the 35-hz qpo in grs 1915 + 105 ( compare the right panel of figure 9 in @xcite and the left panel of figure [ fig4 ] ) . if these two qpos were the same feature scaled by mass , by analogy we would expect to see a qpo in re j1034 + 396 at about twice the frequency of the @xmath0 hz qpo , contrary to what is observed .",
    "the idea that the phase lags of the hfqpos are due to reflection off the accretion disc also needs to address the rms spectrum of the hfqpos . @xcite and @xcite found that the rms spectrum ( rms amplitude vs. energy ) of the 67-hz qpo in grs 1915 + 105 increases very steeply with energy , from @xmath46% at 4 kev to @xmath48% at 30 kev .",
    "similarly , the rms spectrum of the 280-hz qpo in xte j1550564 increases with energy @xcite , and the 450-hz qpo in gro j165540 is only detected at high energies @xcite . in some cases ,",
    "when hfqpos are observed , the @xmath9 kev emission of the accretion disc is @xmath49 per cent of the total luminosity of the source ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and therefore emission from the disc alone can not explain the amplitude of the hfqpos .",
    "if the oscillation mechanism that produces the hfqpos takes place in the disc , the signal must be modulated and amplified in the corona ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a similar discussion in the case of the kilohertz qpos in neutron - star systems ) , and this should affect the phase lags of the hfqpo .      on time - scales of @xmath50 s in black - hole ( and neutron - star ) x - ray binaries in the hard state the hard x - ray photons lag the soft ones by @xmath51 rad , with the phase lags being more or less constant as a function of fourier frequency ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these broadband frequency - independent hard phase lags are usually explained in terms of compton up - scattering in a hot electron plasma close to the black hole : low - energy photons gain energy in each scattering event ; more scatterings imply higher energy of the emerging photons , and also a longer path length , therefore the higher - energy photons emerge later than the lower energy ones produced simultaneously .",
    "the phase lags of the 67-hz qpo in , respectively , grs 1915 + 105 and igr j170913624 , the 300-hz and 450-hz qpo in gro j165540 and the 180-hz/280-hz qpo in xte j1550564 are consistent with this scenario , whereas the soft phase lags of the 35-hz qpo in grs 1915 + 105 contradict this idea .",
    "soft phase lags could be due to hard photons emitted from the hot corona around the black hole that are compton down - scattered by cold plasma in the accretion disc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a compton down - scattering mechanism for the time lags of the 35-hz qpo in grs 1915 + 105 is difficult to reconcile with the fact that the hard ( power - law like ) component in the time - averaged spectrum of this system ( and other black - holes systems ) is interpreted as compton up - scattering @xcite . as shown by @xcite ,",
    "lags of opposite sign are possible even if the photon arrival times at different qpo harmonic frequencies are the same .",
    "this could perhaps explain the opposite sign of the possibly harmonically - related @xcite qpos at 35 hz and 67 hz in grs 1915 + 105 , without the need to resort to complex compton up- and down - scattering mechanisms operating at the same time .",
    "neutron - star x - ray binaries also exhibit a pair of high - frequency qpos , at frequencies between @xmath52 hz , much higher than the frequency of the hfqpos in black - hole systems .",
    "these are called kilohertz quasi - periodic oscillations ( khz qpos ) .",
    "it is unclear , however , whether the khz qpos and the hfqpos are the same phenomena , and whether the two members of the pair of khz qpos and those of the pair of hfqpos ( when two are present ) can be identified with one another . from the pair of khz qpos , the one at lowest frequency ,",
    "the lower khz qpo , displays soft time lags of @xmath53s , with the magnitude of the lags increasing with energy @xcite .",
    "the time lags of the other khz qpo , the upper khz qpo , are hard , of @xmath54s , independent of energy , and significantly different from the time lags of the lower khz qpo @xcite .",
    "the lags in neutron - star systems have similar properties to those in black - hole systems .",
    "for instance , in grs 1915 + 105 the phase lags of the 35-hz qpo and those of the lower khz qpo in the neutron - star systems 4u 160852 and 4u 163653 are soft , whereas the phase lags of the 67-hz qpo and those of the upper khz qpo in 4u 160852 and 4u 163653 are hard .",
    "furthermore , in grs 1915 + 105 the absolute value of the time lags of the 35-hz is about 3 times that of the 67-hz qpo ( @xmath33 ms and @xmath55 ms , respectively ) , while in 4u 163653 the absolute value of the time lags of the lower khz qpo is about twice that of the upper khz qpo ( @xmath56s and @xmath54s , respectively ) . based on this ,",
    "it is tempting to identify the lower and upper khz qpo in neutron stars with the 35-hz and the 67-hz qpo in grs 1915 + 105 , but this identification is not without problem : the phase lags of the 67-hz qpo in grs 1915 + 105 increase with energy , whereas in the two neutron - star systems the time lags of the upper khz qpo are independent of energy , similar to what we observe for the phase lags of the 180-hz and 280-hz qpo in xte j1550564 and the 300-hz qpos in gro j165540 . additionally , grs 1915 + 105 shows qpos at 27 hz @xcite and 41 hz @xcite in observations in which the 67-hz qpo is also present , which makes the identification with the pair of khz qpos in neutron stars more difficult .",
    "notice , by the way , that if the same mechanism proposed to explain the lags in 1h0707495 is responsible for the lags in galactic black holes and neutron - star systems , the magnitude of the time lags of the khz qpos and those of grs 1915 + 105 imply that the distance between the source of photons and the reflector in grs 1915 + 105 is @xmath57 times larger than in the two neutron - star systems 4u 160852 and 4u 163653 , whereas the mass ratio is only @xmath55 .",
    "@xcite proposed a compton up - scattering scenario that can explain the soft time lags of the lower khz qpo in neutron - star systems .",
    "they found a solution of the linearised kompaneets equation @xcite in which the disc and the corona are coupled and exchange energy , and the coronal and disc temperatures oscillate coherently at the qpo frequency ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this model reproduces both the time lags @xcite and rms spectrum @xcite of the lower kilohertz qpo in 4u 160852 .",
    "also , since the resonance is restricted to a limited frequency range , the idea of @xcite is consistent with the hard lags on time - scales of @xmath58 s that we previously mentioned and , in the case of neutron stars , the hard lags of the upper kilohertz qpo @xcite .",
    "this mechanism may also apply to accreting black - hole systems ; it remains to be seen whether this could explain as well the soft lags of the 35-hz qpo and the hard lags of the 67-hz qpo in grs 1915 + 105 .",
