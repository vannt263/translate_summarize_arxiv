    "t crb is one of the few known galactic recurrent novae ( warner 1995 , schaefer 2010 ) , with outbursts recorded in 1866 and 1946 .",
    "they have been spectacular events , peaking around 2.0 mag ( pettit 1946 ) , displaying nearly identical lightcurves characterized by an extremely fast rise to maximum and a rapid decline , taking @xmath4=3.8 days to decline by 2 mag ( payne - gaposchkin 1957 ) .",
    "the spectroscopic evolution ( sanford 1946 , 1949 ) was - in modern terms - that of an he / n nova ( williams 1992 ) , reaching very high ionization conditions as indicated by the presence of strong [ fex ] and [ fexiv ] coronal lines ( sanford 1947 ) . peculiar to t crb is the presence on both outbursts , of a secondary , fainter and broader maximum @xmath3110 days past the primary maximum , which physical nature is still debated ( e.g. webbink 1976 , cannizzo & kenyon 1992 , selvelli , cassatella , & gilmozzi 1992 , ruffert , cannizzo , & kenyon 1993 ) .",
    "the donor star in t crb is an m3iii , filling its roche lobe ( bailey 1975 , yudin & munari 1993 ) , on a 227.55 day orbit ( kenyon & garcia 1986 , fekel et al .",
    "2000 ) around a wd companion ( selvelli , cassatella , & gilmozzi 1992 , belczynski & mikolajewska 1998 ) .",
    "the presence of a cool giant makes t crb also a member of the class of symbiotic binaries ( allen 1984 , kenyon 1986 ) , similarly to the other symbiotic recurrent novae rs oph , v745 sco and v3890 sgr ( munari 1997 ) .    the brightness in quiescence ( @xmath5@xmath310 mag ) and the favourable position on the sky ( absence of seasonal gaps in the observability from the northern emisphere ) ,",
    "have fostered continued interest and study of t crb . in quiescence , typical symbiotic binaries display a rich and high ionization emission line spectrum ( comprising [ nev ] , [ cav ] , [ fevii ] , heii , and raman scattered ovi ) , superimposed to the absorption spectrum of the cool giant , with the nebular continuum veiling in the yellow , and overwhelming in the blue , its molecular absorption bands ( allen 1984 , munari and zwitter 2002 , skopal 2005 ) . as a symbiotic binary",
    ", the optical quiescence spectrum of t crb is atypical in showing very little else than the m3iii absorption spectrum .",
    "most of the time , only a weak emission in h@xmath6 is noticeable on low resolution spectra ( kenyon 1986 ) . on rare occasions ,",
    "a surge in activity causes the optical spectrum of t crb to show something more typical of symbiotic binaries , e.g. balmer lines and continuum in emission , and sometimes even the appearance of a weak heii 4686 in emission ( iijima 1990 , anupama & prabhu 1991 ) .    in this paper",
    "we report on the super - active conditions displayed by t crb during 2015 ( in the following sact-2015 for short ) , conditions never seen before .",
    "sact-2015 appears to be much stronger , both photometrically and spectroscopically , than previous periods of enhanced activity recorded after the 1946 nova outburst .",
    "@xmath1@xmath5@xmath7@xmath8 optical photometry of t crb is regularly obtained since 2006 with ans collaboration telescopes n. 11 and 36 , located in italy in trieste and cembra , respectively .",
    "the star has been observed on 205 nights , from may 11 , 2006 to dec 20 , 2015 .",
    "the operation of ans collaboration telescopes is described in detail by munari et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and munari & moretti ( 2012 ) .",
    "the same local photometric sequence , calibrated by henden & munari ( 2006 ) against landolt equatorial standards , was used at both telescopes on all observing epochs , ensuing a high consistency of the data .",
    "the @xmath1@xmath5@xmath7@xmath8 photometry of t crb is given in table  1 , where the quoted uncertainties are the total error budget , which quadratically combines the measurement error on the variable with the error associated to the transformation from the local to the standard photometric system ( as defined by the photometric comparison sequence ) .",
    "all measurements were carried out with aperture photometry , the long focal length of the telescopes and the absence of nearby contaminating stars not requiring to revert to psf - fitting .",
    "low resolution spectra of t crb were obtained with the 1.22 m telescope + b&c spectrograph operated in asiago by the department of physics and astronomy of the university of padova .",
    "the ccd camera is a andor idus du440a with a back - illuminated e2v 42 - 10 sensor , 2048@xmath9512 array of 13.5 @xmath10 m pixels .",
    "it is highly efficient in the blue down to the atmospheric cut - off around 3250   .",
    "the spectral dispersion is 2.31 ang / pix and the spectral resolution is constant at @xmath32.2 pix , with the spectra extending from @xmath33300 to @xmath38050   .",
    "the slit width has been kept fixed at 2 arcsec , and the slit always alligned with the parallactic angle for optimal absolute flux calibration .",
    "high resolution spectra were obtained with the echelle spectrograph mounted on the 1.82 m asiago telescope .",
    "it is equipped with an eev  ccd47 - 10 ccd , 1024@xmath91024 array , 13 @xmath10 m pixel , covering the interval @xmath11  3600@xmath127300    in 32 orders , at a resolving power of 20000 and without inter - order wavelength gaps .",
    "the 2006 - 2015 @xmath1@xmath5@xmath7@xmath8 lightcurves of t crb from our ccd observations of table  1 are plotted on the left panel of figure  1 .",
    "the much brighter state of t crb in 2015 is evident , with increasing revelance toward shorter wavelengths . on the right panel of figure  1 ,",
    "the 2006 - 2014 data ( preceeding sact-2015 ) are phase plotted against the orbital ephemeris @xmath13 which gives the epochs of primary minima ( passages of the m3iii companion at inferior conjunction ) for the orbital period derived by kenyon & garcia ( 1986 ) and fekel et al .",
    "the resulting phased lightcurve is dominated by the well known ellipsoidal distortion of the m3iii giant , first reported by bailey ( 1975 ) at optical wavelengths and by yudin & munari ( 1993 ) in the infrared .",
    "the over - plotted curves are simple fits to guide the eye , in particular to demonstrate that : ( @xmath14 ) the amplitude of the ellipsoidal modulation , as given by the fitting curves , is @xmath15=0.63 , @xmath16=0.49 , @xmath17=0.42 , and @xmath18=0.34 mag ; ( @xmath19 ) the secondary minimum ( phase 0.5 , wd passing at inferior conjunction ) is shallower at shorter wavelengths , a fact due to the irradiation of the cool giant by the hot wd companion ; and ( @xmath20 ) the dispersion of points around the fitting curves increases toward shorter wavelengths and is well in excess of the small observational errors ( cf table  1 ) .",
    "the reason for that is associated with the erratic behaviour of accretion phenomena in the system .",
    "in fact , a long record of observations document a large amplitude _ flickering _ affecting time series observations of t crb ( eg .",
    "zamanov & bruch 1998 , zamanov et al .",
    "2004 , gromadzki et al .",
    "2006 , dobrotka et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "the photometric data on t crb secured during sact-2015 are not inserted in the right panel of figure  1 , which only deals with the preceding quiescence .",
    "the sact-2015 data are instead plotted in figure  2 , against the same ephemeris as used for figure  1 , from which the polynomial fits are also copied . from figure  2",
    "we infer that : ( i ) the shorter the wavelength , the larger the increase in brightness during sact-2015 : compared with preceding quiescence ( as given by the fitting curves in figures  1 and 2 ) , the increase is @xmath0@xmath1=0.72 , @xmath0@xmath5=0.28 , @xmath0@xmath7=0.21 , and @xmath0@xmath8=0.09 mag ; ( ii ) during sact-2015 , the orbital modulation disappears from the @xmath1 lightcurve , and the depth of secondary minimum ( orbital phase 0.5 ) is reduced in the @xmath5 and @xmath7 lightcurves ; and ( iii ) contrary to previous high states that did not influence t crb brightness at longer wavelengths , the effect of sact-2015 extends well into the far red , with all @xmath8 measurements laying above the polynomial fit to quiescence data . anticipating the spectroscopic results from following sections ,",
    "these photometric signatures are due to : ( 1 ) nebular emission from a much larger fraction of the m3iii wind now ionized by the hot source , which visibility is not affected by orbital motion , and ( 2 ) increased irradiation and therefore higher re - emission from the side of the m3iii facing the hot source . in this respect it is interesting to note that the dispersion of the observations is similar during sact-2015 and quiescence , with @xmath21(@xmath1)=0.115 and 0.120 mag , respectively .",
    "this suggests that the increased output from the hot source is powered by the same accretion processes and associated instabilities that dominates during quiescence .",
    "in addition , the large amplitude and short time scale ( of the order of a day or a few days at most ) of these erratic fluctuations , suggests that the electron density in the ionized gas ( dominating the system brightness in @xmath1 ) is high enough to drive a short recombination time scale , so that the short time scale and large amplitude of the variations in the photo - ionization input are not washed out by reprocessing from the recombining gas .",
    "to place sact-2015 into a broader perspective , we investigated the long term brightness evolution of t crb following the 1946 nova outburst .",
    "the outburst was over by the summer of 1947 when the star had returned to quiescence brightness , @xmath5@xmath310 mag .",
    "this value is similar to what f.  w.  a. argelander measured in 1855 - before the 1866 nova outburst - for his bonner durchmusterung ( bd ) star atlas , and to the brighntess that characterized the star in between the two nova eruptions of 1866 and 1946 ( barnard 1907 , campbell & shapley 1923 ) .    to reconstruct the 1947 - 2015 lightcurve of t crb",
    ", we selected to use the 120,000 visual estimates collected by aavso ( privately communicated by stella kafka , director ) .",
    "this choice is based on two primary reasons .",
    "the first in that the visual estimates collected by aavso constitute an uninterrupted record of t crb brightness during the last 70 years , whereas other sources of information ( measurements in any photometric band ) are too sparse in time and scattered through so many different observers , instrumental combinations and photometric systems to be of no use to our goal .",
    "the second argument is based on the fact that during the last 70 years , each epoch has been chacarterized by a different type of instrument to record stellar brightness : initially unfiltered blue sensitive photographic emulsions , then filtered pancromatic photographic emulsions , followed by photoelectric photometers , and finally by ccd devices .",
    "the very red color of t crb ( much redder than most of the suitable comparison stars around the variable ) has impacted in different ways and by different amounts the photometry collected with such a broad assortment of instruments .",
    "in addition , only rarely the data have been properly transformed to standard systems , most of the measurements being just differential with respect to a single field star ( usually of unmatching colors ) . on the contrary ,",
    "visual estimates seem to be far more stable over different epochs and subsequent generations of observers : the comparison sequence has not changed much and the many different observers participating in the 70 years of aavso monitoring have used the same measuring device , their unfiltered eyes .     [ tab2 ]      in tracking the secular evolution of t crb following the 1946 outburst , we are looking for subtle effects ( of the order of hundredths of a magnitude ) , much less than the scatter intrinsic to visual estimates .",
    "we have to filter out the noise .",
    "the simplest way could be to average all data within a given time step .",
    "such a straight average would however most likely generate spurious signals .",
    "in fact , the majority of the visual estimates are concentrated during the summer and autumn months , when t crb is best located in the evening sky .",
    "given the long orbital period of the system ( about 62% of 1 year ) , this would mean that in different years the system is on average observed at different orbital phases .",
    "given the large amplitude of the orbital modulation , this would cause a spurious beating signal .    to overcome the problem , we have divided the aavso data into contingous orbital cycles ( 110 cycles from 1947 to current time ) , and @xmath22 fitted to them the average phased lightcurve for quiescence ( the continous curve for @xmath5 band in figure  1 ) . in this way ,",
    "no matter how unevenly distributed in orbital phase the observations could be , a correct estimate for the magnitude averaged along a whole orbital cycle is obtained .",
    "the values so derived are plotted in figure  3 .",
    "the secular trend of t crb in quiescence , shown in figure  3 , is characterized by three basic features : ( i ) an initial faster decline , at a mean rate of 0.0178 mag per orbital period , lasting for the initial @xmath312 years ( 1947 - 1959 ) , ( ii ) a slower decline , at a mean rate of 0.0025 mag per orbital period , characterizing the following @xmath355 years until present time , and ( iii ) a few episodes of enhanced brightness occouring after 1975 .",
    "four such episodes are clearly present in figure  3 : the first three occurred in 1975 - 1985 , 1996 - 1997 and 2001 - 2004 , and were of decreasing peak brightness ; the fourth and last one , sact-2015 is characterized by the largest amplitude with respect the underlying secular trend .",
    "in addition to the largest increase in brightness , sact-2015 has also seen the greatest spectroscopic changes displayed by t crb since the 1946 nova outburst .",
    "the most obvious changes are the unprecedented intensity attained by heii 4686 ( in excess of h@xmath2 ) , the large intensity of oiii and niii lines involved in the bowen fluorescence mechanism , and the appearance of high ionization lines like [ nev ] 3427 , all these on top of strong nebular and balmer continua .",
    "the spectroscopic changes are best illustrated by figure  4 , where two spectra for exactly the same orbital phase ( @xmath23=0.53 , wd passing at inferior conjunction ) are compared , one from sact-2015 and the other from the preceeding quiescence .",
    "the 2015 - 10 - 16 spectrum corresponds to the strongest recorded intensity of heii during sact-2015 , while the quiescence 2012 - 09 - 03 spectrum is well representative of the usual ( and dull ) apperance of t crb during quiescence , when only some weak emission in h@xmath6 is visible over an otherwise normal m3iii absorption spectrum .",
    "the result of the subtraction of the quiescence ( 2012 - 09 - 03 ) from the sact-2015 spectrum ( 2015 - 10 - 16 ) is plotted on the lower panel of figure  4 .",
    "it is a fine example of emission from ionized gas of high density ( plots built in the same way from other sact-2015 spectra provide similar results ) .",
    "integrated flux of the emission lines identified in this nebular spectrum are provided in table  2 .    at the reddest wavelengths ,",
    "weak features are left in the subtraction of the tio molecular bands from the two spectra of figure  4 . to evaluate them , in figure  5 we plot template spectra for m2iii and m3iii giants taken from the atlas of fluks et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , after scaling them to the @xmath5 and @xmath24 mean values of t crb in quiescence at the same orbital phase ( @xmath23=0.53 ) . in the same figure  5 we plot their difference ,",
    "which is also over - plotted to the nebular spectrum of figure  4 , where it provides a perfect match to the weak features left over at reddest wavelengths by the subtraction of the sact-2015 and quiescence spectra .",
    "this indicates that the irradiation by the hot source has rised the temperature of the facing side of the giant companion , from that of a m3iii during quiescence to that of a m2iii during sact-2015 .",
    "this change corresponds to an increase in the effective temperature of @xmath0@xmath25@xmath380  k , averaging between @xmath0@xmath25=90  k and @xmath0@xmath25=70  k reported by ridgway et al .",
    "( 1980 ) and fluks et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , respectively , as the difference in temperature between m2iii and m3iii giants .",
    "the intensity of heii has varied considerably during sact-2015 , as illustrated by the sample of spectra presented in figure  6 . in this figure",
    "we also plot for comparison the spectrum for 2014 - 11 - 02 , that caught t crb on the transition from quiescence to sact-2015 , which show increased nebular emission ( both continuum and lines ) and the first appearance of heii .",
    "table  3 lists the integrated flux for a few representative lines as measured on our sact-2015 low resolution spectra .",
    "some comments are here in order concerning the nebular spectrum of t crb during sact-2015 , a detailed photo - ionization modeling being pursued elsewhere .",
    "the fluxes of emission lines listed in tables  2 and 3 are little affected by the low extinction experienced by t crb . the 3d galactic dust model by munari et al .",
    "( 2014 ) indicate a total interstellar extinction @xmath26=0.048 along the line of sight to t crb , and similarly very low values of @xmath26=0.058 and @xmath26=0.067 are derived from the 3d galactic dust distributions of schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) and schlafly & finkbeiner ( 2011 ) , respectively .",
    "cassatella et al .",
    "( 1982 ) from analysis of iue ultraviolet spectra derived a slightly larger reddening , @xmath26=0.15 , that could indicate some contribution by local circumstellar matter around t crb .",
    "after dereddening , the ratio of balmer line fluxes listed in table  2 suggests a negligible optical depth in h@xmath6 , following the analysis of barker ( 1978 ) and feibelman ( 1983 ) .",
    "the spectra of t crb in figure  4 display a strong @xmath27 4640    blend .",
    "it is due to three niii lines ( multiplet n.2 ) pumped by bowen fluorescence mechanism ( bfm in the following ; bowen 1934 , 1935 ) .",
    "these lines ( 4634 , 4640 , 4641   ) are resolved in the echelle spectrum for 2015 - 11 - 02 presented in figure  7 ( right panel ) .",
    "their production begins with emission of heii ly-@xmath6 photons at 303.8   , which wavelength corresponds to that of oiii transiting from its ground state to an excited level .",
    "the oiii downward transitions produce photons at 3415 , 3428 and 3444   in the 1:8:54 proportions .",
    "the oiii 3444 line is observed in strong emission in sact-2015 spectra , as illustrated in the left panel of figure  7 , while the other two oiii lines are blended with nearby lines .",
    "the end product of the oiii downward transitions is the emission of photons at 374.4    which correspond to the transition of niii from its ground to an excited state .",
    "the following de - excitation results in the emission of the three lines constituting the @xmath27 4640    blend above mentioned , and in a pair of lines at 4097 and 4103    ( niii multiplet n.1 ) , which are also in strong emission in t crb as illustrated by the central panel of figure  7 .",
    "it is also worth noticing that in the sact-2015 spectra figure  6 , the intensity of oiii 3444 and niii 4640 blend varies in parallel with that of heii 4686 , as expected when bfm is ruling .",
    "the bfm pumping has been studied in detail in symbiotic stars by eriksson et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and selvelli et al .",
    "the efficency of the bfm in t crb during sact-2015 ( defined as the fraction of heii ly-@xmath6 photons that leads to oiii upward transitions ) is @xmath30.35 , following harrington ( 1972 ) formalism .",
    "we have detected [ nev ] 3427 emission line in the optical spectra of t crb , to the best of our knowledge the first time this have occourred away from nova eruptions , a further indication of the exceptional state t crb has underwent in 2015 .",
    "the line is identified in the portion of t crb spectrum highlighted in the left panel of figure  7 .",
    "the line is observed at 3428   , at the mean position for [ nev ] 3427 and oiii 3429 , which contributes equal amounts to the observed flux .",
    "in fact , from table  2 , the observed flux for the 3428 blend is 1/3 of oiii 3444 , while that expected from oiii 3429 alone would be 1/6.5 , according to both theoretical transition probabilities and actual observations in symbiotic binaries ( selvelli et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the simultaneous presence of both [ nev ] 3427 and [ neiii ] 3869 could suggest that [ neiv ] lines should be equally present in the nebular spectrum of t crb .",
    "the strongest optical [ neiv ] lines are located at 4715 - 4727  (merrill 1956 ) , and they never attend a significant intensity ( when seen in symbiotic binaries , they score only a few % of the intensity of [ nev ] and [ neiii ] lines ; cf .",
    "allen 1983 , munari & zwitter 2002 ) .",
    "the non - detection of [ neiv ] in the spectra of t crb is therefore not surprising .",
    "similarly , the strongest oiv line that is observed at optical wavelengths is the 3411   ( jaschek & jaschek 2009 ) , and given its modest intensity in the spectra of t crb no further lines from this ion are expected to be visible .    the relative intensity of hei and heii emission lines varied greatly during sact-2015 , as illustrated by the sample of spectra plotted in figure  6 and the line fluxes listed in table  3 . the heii 4686 / ( hei 5876 + hei 6678 ) ratio is seen to vary from 0.17 on 2014 - 11 - 02 , to 0.34 on 2015 - 08 - 30 , to 0.88 on 2015 - 10 - 16 . for the latter two dates ,",
    "the hei lines augment their intensity by just 20% while heii increases by three times .",
    "this behaviour indicates that during quiescence and the initial rise toward sact-2015 , the nebula was _ ionization bounded _ , with properly nested stromgren s spheres for different ions and neutral material further out , ready to be ionized by an increase in the hot source output . during sact ,",
    "the nebula became _ density bounded _",
    ", i.e. all the available gas was already ionized and any increase in the hot source output could only rise the ionization degree of the gas but not further expand the nebula into pre - existing external neutral material .",
    "the ionization to density bounded transition is nicely confirmed by the evolution of the h@xmath6 profiles shown in figure  8 , where a quiescence ( 2013 - 04 - 23 ) and a sact-2015 ( 2015 - 10 - 26 ) profile for exactly the same orbital phase ( 0.56 ) are compared .",
    "the h@xmath6 profile for quiescence shows a weak emission and superimposed to it a narrow aborption , which is missing from the sact-2015 profile that displays a vastly stronger emission .",
    "this narrow absorption is typical of symbiotic stars , and originates in the outflowing wind of the cool giant , specifically from the neutral portion external to the fraction ionized by the wd , as it was demonstrated by munari ( 1993 ) who followed for several cycles the orbital motion of the cool giant , of the emission lines and of the narrow absorptions in eg and , a symbiotic star with optical spectra closely similar to those of t crb in quiescence .",
    "the absence of the narrow central aborption from the sact-2015 profile indicate that , in the direction of the observer , no neutral gas exists external to the ionized gas .",
    "the velocity of the narrow absorption is -19 km  sec@xmath28 with respect to that of the cool giant , which is therefore the terminal velocity of its outfowing wind , a value typical of cool giants .",
    "finally , the values reported in table  3 shows how the intensity of heii 4686 emission line is more responsive to the varying activity of the hot source than to the orbital aspect .",
    "iijima ( 1990 ) noted that during quiscence , i.e. away from the 1866 and 1946 nova outbursts , t crb exhibits two states : an  high \" one when emission lines ( balmer , hei ) and the nebular continuum are relatively strong , and a  low \" state when they essentially disappear ( except some weak residual emission in h@xmath6 ) . the unique conditions eperienced by t crb during sact-2015 requires the introduction of a new , third state that we term  super - active \" , which is characterized by ( 1 ) the presence of oiv and [ nev ] lines and a very strong heii 4686 , a strong 4640 bowen fluorescence blend , ( 2 ) a large increse in mean brightness , and ( 3 ) disappearance of orbital modulation from @xmath1-band lightcurve .",
    "we have searched the available leterature ( e.g. kraft 1958 , gravina 1981 , andrillat & houziaux 1982 , blair et al .",
    "1983 , williams 1983 , kenyon and garcia 1986 , iijima 1990 , anupama & prabhu 1991 , ivison et al .",
    "1994 , anupama 1997 , zamanov and marti 2001 , munari & zwitter 2002 ) in the attempt to reconstruct the history of spectroscopic activity of t crb during quiescence .",
    "this has turned out a difficult task because rarely integrated absolute fluxes are provided for the emission lines , few observations ventured enough into the blue to cover the balmer continuum , and usually only equivalent widths are given if not just a mere descrition like weak or strong. in addition the observations reported in literature were obtained at different wavelength intervals and resolving powers .",
    "we tried our best to homogenize the different sources , and in this we took advantage of the many ( unpublished ) spectra of t crb that we have regularly obtained since 1987 .",
    "t crb has always been in a low state when observed for the first 3 decades after the 1946 outburst .",
    "the last of these spectra , those of blair et al .",
    "( 1983 ) for 1981 - 02 - 06 , williams ( 1983 ) for 1981 - 06 - 10 , and gravina ( 1981 ) for 1981 - 07 - 15 and 1981 - 09 - 15 record only feeble emission in h@xmath6 , h@xmath29 and h@xmath2 .",
    "iijima ( 1990 ) reports that , in addition to balmer and hei , a weak emission in heii 4686    was visible on his spectra on several dates distributed between 1982 and 1987 , but kenyon and garcia ( 1986 ) saw no heii in emission on their 1984 and 1985 spectra and the absolute flux they measured for balmer lines was only twice larger than that reported by blair et al .",
    "( 1983 ) for 1981 .",
    "the extensive spectral monitoring by anupama & prabhu ( 1991 ) and anupama ( 1997 ) shows that the intensity of balmer and hei emission lines gradually increased starting with june 1985 , peaked during november 1986 , and returned to the low state by october 1987 , where t crb has remained until 1996 .",
    "iijima ( 1990 ) confirms that heii was absent from his spectra for 1988 , 1989 and 1990 , the same reported by ivison et al ( 1994 ) for their 1989 spectra .",
    "just a feable emission in the lower balmer lines and no heii were found by munari & zwitter ( 2002 ) on various dates of 1993 and 1995 .",
    "then a new high state was briefly observed in 1996 - 1997 . on 1996 - 02 - 01",
    "zamanov & marti ( 2001 ) found h@xmath6 to be weak and this is confirmed by a 1996 - 02 - 08 spectrum from munari & zwitter ( 2002 ) that in addition reveals heii to be absent .",
    "then , mikolajewski et al . (",
    "1997 ) found h@xmath6 to be in strong emission during april , may and june of 1996 .",
    "this is confirmed by a 1996 - 05 - 30 spectrum from munari & zwitter ( 2002 ) , that in addition shows how heii was still absent .",
    "zamanov & marti ( 2001 ) reports that by 1998 this second high state of t crb was over .",
    "since then and to the best of our knowledge , t crb has never been observed again in a high state until the 2015 episode described in this paper . the long term photometric behaviour presented in figure  3 shows that t crb rised significantly above the underlying secular decline only in correspondence of the high spectroscopic states .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "t crb has been caught in a super - active state in only one other occasion , on the summer of 1938 by hachenberg & wellmann ( 1939 ) . on their spectrum for 22 july 1938 ,",
    "heii 4686 is half the intensity of h@xmath2 and the 4640    blend stands in prominent emission ( 2/3 the intensity of heii ) .",
    "the hachenberg & wellmann ( 1939 ) spectrum for august 28 confirms the super - active state , while that for september 22 indicates a rapid return of t crb toward lower excitation conditions .",
    "there is an intriguing parallelism between sact-2015 and what hachenberg & wellmann ( 1939 ) observed in 1938 .",
    "the super - active state they caught occurred @xmath370 years past the 1866 nova outburst , and sact-2015 is occurring @xmath370 years past the 1946 nova outburst .",
    "is therefore everything in place for a new nova outburst in 2026 , again @xmath380 years past the last eruption  ?    00",
