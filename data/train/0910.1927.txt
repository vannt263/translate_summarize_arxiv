    "2002 ) ; and the remaining 3 are interstellar molecules containing elements of the halogen group ( viia ) : hcl , hf , and cf@xmath0 .",
    "although they are only minor constituents of the interstellar medium , halogen - containing molecules are of special interest because of their unique thermochemistry .",
    "the basic behavior of any atom in the interstellar medium is determined by two or three key thermochemical considerations .",
    "first , the first ionization potential ( ip ) determines whether the atom will be neutral or ionized within diffuse molecular clouds : an atom x with ip(x ) @xmath8 ip(h ) = 13.6 ev will be shielded by atomic hydrogen from the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) and will be predominantly neutral , while an atom with ip(x ) @xmath9 ip(h ) will be predominantly ionized .",
    "second , the dissociation energy of the neutral hydride , @xmath10(hx ) , determines whether x can react exothermically with h@xmath11 : atoms for which @xmath10(hx ) @xmath8 @xmath10(h@xmath11 ) = 4.48 ev can react exothermically with h@xmath11 to form hx , while atoms with @xmath10(hx ) @xmath12(h@xmath11 ) can not .",
    "third ( and of importance mainly for atoms with ip @xmath9 13.6 ev ) , the dissociation energy of the hydride molecular ion , @xmath10(hx@xmath0 ) , similarly determines whether the ion x@xmath0 can react exothermically with h@xmath11 to form hx@xmath0 .",
    "fluorine and chlorine are unique in regard to the second and third criteria , each in a different way : f is the only atom  and cl@xmath0 is the only ion with an appearance potential @xmath9 13.6 ev  that can react exothermically with h@xmath11 to form a diatomic hydride .",
    "the uniqueness of these elements are presented graphically in figure 1 , which shows @xmath10(hx ) for each atom x in the first three rows of the periodic table .",
    "the molecular binding energy of hx is largest for fluorine and decreases , nearly monotonically , as one moves leftwards and downwards in the periodic table . in figure 2 , @xmath10(hx ) and @xmath10(hx@xmath0 ) are shown for all the elements of which interstellar molecules have been detected .",
    "red squares apply to atoms with ip @xmath9 ip(h ) and blue squares to those with ip @xmath8 ip(h ) . with the exception of the halogen elements , all the elements fall into two classes :    \\(1 ) _ oxygen and nitrogen , with ip @xmath8 ip(h ) , @xmath10(hx ) @xmath9 @xmath10(h@xmath11 ) and @xmath10(hx@xmath0 ) @xmath8 @xmath10(h@xmath11 ) . _",

    "the chemistry of interstellar fluorine has been considered in a previous study by neufeld , wolfire & schilke ( 2005 ; hereafter nws05 ) , while that of chlorine has been discussed in several studies , most recently those of schilke , wang & phillips ( 1995 ) and amin ( 1996 ) . in the present paper , we extend and update these previous investigations to account for recent developments in experimental and theoretical studies of relevant chemical processes .",
    "our study is also motivated by the prospects for upcoming observations of halogen - containing molecules , particularly with the _ herschel space observatory_.",

    "the chemical network is initiated by reaction of cl@xmath0 with h@xmath11 :    @xmath13    which is followed by dissociative recombination of hcl@xmath0 or a further h atom abstraction reaction to form h@xmath11cl@xmath0 : @xmath14 the @xmath4 molecular ion undergoes dissociative recombination to form either hcl or cl @xmath15 @xmath16 the branching ratio for dissociative recombination of h@xmath11cl@xmath0 has not yet been measured , but has been assumed in previous studies to be only 10@xmath7 for production of hcl ( reaction 3 ) .",
    "this assumption was largely motivated by the small hcl abundances observed in diffuse clouds ( see  4 below . )",
    "hcl is destroyed by photodissociation , by photoionization and by reactions with he@xmath0 , h@xmath17 and c@xmath0 .    in regions where h@xmath11 is present , reactions ( 1 ) ,",
    "( 2 ) and ( 4 ) can rapidly convert cl@xmath0 to cl .",
    "the rate at which the reaction network is initiated ( reaction 1 ) is therefore limited by the availability of cl@xmath0 ions .",
    "these are produced primarily by the photoionization of cl , following the absorption of ultraviolet photons in the @xmath18 wavelength range .",
    "near cloud surfaces , the uv radiation field is dominated by starlight ( i.e.  by the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) or nearby ob associations ) , whereas in the deep interiors of dense clouds , the radiation largely comprises h@xmath11 lyman and werner band emissions excited by the secondary electrons produced by cosmic rays . here , proton transfer from h@xmath17 to cl , producing hcl@xmath0 , can also initiate the formation of cl - bearing molecules .    taking as our starting point the reaction list and compilation of rate coefficients in the udfa ( formerly umist ) rate file ( woodall et al .",
    "2007 ) , we have reviewed the rate coefficients critically and implemented the following changes :    \\1 ) for reaction of hcl with he@xmath0 , h@xmath17 and c@xmath0 , we have used the statistical adiabatic capture model ( sacm ; troe 1985 , 1987 , 1996 ; see nws05 for details of exactly how this was implemented ) to estimate the temperature dependence of the capture rate .",
    "over the temperature range 10  300 k , we found the capture rate to be proportional to @xmath19 for rotationally - cold hcl ; accordingly we adopted a @xmath19 dependence for the assumed reaction rate .",
    "similar considerations lead to a @xmath20 temperature dependence for the rate coefficient for the reaction of h@xmath11o with h@xmath11cl@xmath0 .",
    "we also adjusted the t = 300 k rate coefficients in the udfa compilation , which were based upon measurements of the thermal rate coefficients , to account for the fact that hcl is primarily in j = 0 ( i.e.  rotationally - cold ) under the astrophysical conditions of typical interest ; here again , we used the sacm model to estimate the necessary correction factors .",
    "2 ) as in nws05 , we adopted a rate coefficient of @xmath21 for the dissociative recombination of diatomic molecular ions ( in the absence of experimentally - determined values ) . for the dissociative recombination of h@xmath11cl@xmath0",
    ", we adopted a rate coefficient of @xmath22 , based upon preliminary results from a recent laboratory measurement ( geppert & hamberg 2009 ) .",
    "because the branching ratios for the production of hcl and cl were not determined in this experiment , we followed previous authors in adopting - as our standard assumption - a branching ratio of 0.1 for the production of hcl .",
    "as discussed in  4.2 below , we also investigated how the model predictions depend upon the assumed value of this branching ratio .",
    "\\3 ) we adopted the rate coefficients of pradhan & dalgarno ( 1994 ) for charge transfer from h@xmath0 to cl , and for the reverse reaction ( from cl@xmath0 to h ) .",
    "these reactions were not included in the udfa compilation , but had been considered by bah86 , who assumed a large rate coefficient of 10@xmath23 for the reaction of h@xmath0 with cl and concluded that this process was among the subset of most significant reactions .",
    "the calculations of pradhan & dalgarno ( 1994 ) , however , imply rate coefficients that are smaller than those guessed by bah86 by factors of @xmath24 and @xmath25 at temperatures of 300 k and 100 k respectively .",
    "\\4 ) we have also included the reaction of cl with h@xmath11 to form hcl and h , which is slightly endothermic ( by @xmath26  ev ) , along with its reverse reaction .",
    "this reaction , which is not included in the udfa compilation , has been the subject of intensive investigation , both experimental ( e.g. kumaran , lim & michael 1994 ; hereafter klm94 ) and theoretical ( e.g. manthe , capecchi & werner 2004 ) .",
    "here we adopted the rate coefficients recommended by klm94 ( their equations 10 , 11 and 6 ) , which were obtained by a fit to their own measurements together with those obtained in previous studies .",
    "\\5 ) in computing revised estimates of the hcl photodissociation and photoionization rates , we have used the photoabsorption cross - sections obtained by brion , dyke & cooper ( 2005 ) by means of dipole ( e , e ) spectroscopy using an electron energy loss spectrometer ( eels ) .",
    "this technique is believed to offer significant advantages over direct uv absorption measurements for the case of strong absorption bands in which line saturation is important ( chan , cooper & brion 1991 ) for example , in the case of excitation to the m@xmath27 state by photons near 110.3 nm , brion et al .  obtained an oscillator strength that was a factor of 4 larger than that obtained in the earlier uv absorption experiments of nee , suto & lee ( 1986 ) .",
    "the continuous absorption cross - sections obtained by brion et al .",
    "( 2005 ) are in good agreement with previous uv absorption measurements ( e.g. cheng et al .",
    "2002 ) .    to determine the photodissociation rate implied by the measured photoabsorption cross - sections",
    ", the photodissociation probability must also be known . for radiation longward of 115 nm ,",
    "the fluorescence yield has been measured ( nee et al .",
    "1986 ) and found to be small , so the photodissociation probability is very close to unity . for absorption in the 105.5  115 nm region , the fluorescence at wavelengths longer than 115 nm",
    "was observed to be weak , but the experiment of nee et al .",
    "( 1986 ) did not exclude the possibility of strong fluorescent emission in the 105.5  115 nm region .",
    "for the 97.3  105.5 nm spectral region , we are unaware of any experimental constraints on the fluorescent yield . in computing the photodissociation rate ,",
    "we have assumed that the dissociation probability is unity .",
    "this therefore constitutes a lower limit on the true value , and is in good agreement with the corresponding minimum value given by vdvhd . ] for all radiation longward of the ionization threshold at @xmath28  nm .",
    "this leads to a photodissociation rate of @xmath29 for an unshielded molecule exposed to the mean interstellar radiation field given by draine ( 1978 ) , a value that is @xmath30 higher than that given by van dishoeck , van hemert & dalgarno ( 1982 ; hereafter vdvhd ) .",
    "this difference is largely accounted for by the fact that the total oscillator strength shortward of 129 nm is now known to exceed significantly the simple estimate given by vdvhd .",
    "we obtain an hcl photoionization rate of @xmath31 .    in considering the effect of shielding upon the hcl photodissociation rate",
    ", we used a method similar to that adopted by nws05 . here , we modeled the case of a semi - infinite slab that is illuminated isotropically , using the photodissociation region ( pdr ) model of le bourlot et al .",
    "1993 and le petit et al .",
    "2006 to determine how the uv radiation field varies with position .",
    "we assumed the photodissociation rate to diminish as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the visual extinction in magnitudes behind the slab surface , @xmath34 is the exponential integral of order 2 , and @xmath35 is an adjustable parameter that we varied in order to obtain the best fit to the predicted photodissociation rate .",
    "the uv dust albedo assumed here was 0.32 , the forward scattering function was 0.73 ( li & draine 2001 ) , and the best fit was obtained for @xmath36 .",
    "\\6 ) our estimate of the cl photoionization rate was based upon measurements of the ionization cross - section by ruscic & berkowitz ( 1983 ) , which are in good agreement with theoretical calculations of brown , carter & kelly ( 1980 ) .",
    "two autoionizing resonances are present at wavelengths longer than the lyman limit , but make a negligible contribution to the overall photoionization rate .",
    "we derived a photoionization rate of @xmath37 for an unshielded chlorine atom exposed to the mean interstellar radiation field given by draine ( 1978 ) , a value that lies a factor of @xmath38 below that adopted by van dishoeck ( 1988 ) .",
    "because the ip of atomic chlorine is only slightly less than that of h , there is only a narrow wavelength range , 912  958@xmath39 , over which photoionization can occur .",
    "radiation in this spectral region is subject not only to absorption by dust , but also to absorption by the h@xmath11 lyman and werner bands and the hi lyman lines . while the effect of hi absorption is small , that of h@xmath11 absorption can be significant .",

    "for that process , an identical treatment yields a reduction factor @xmath42    \\7 ) using the cross - sections cited in ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) above , we have computed the rates of hcl photodissociation , hcl photoionization , and cl photoionization resulting from h@xmath11 lyman and werner band emissions excited by secondary electrons produced by cosmic rays . here",

    ", hf , cf@xmath0 , and hcl are the only halogen - bearing molecules to have been detected in the interstellar medium . in regard to hf , our results are identical to those presented in nws05 : we predict hf to be the dominant gas - phase reservoir of fluorine within both diffuse and dense molecular clouds ; we expect the _ herschel space observatory _ to detect widespread absorption in the hf @xmath1 transition .",
    "however , the abundances we predict for cf@xmath0 lie a factor @xmath92 above the prediction of nws05 , a direct consequence of the smaller dissociation rate adopted for cf@xmath0 in the present study .",
    "as noted by neufeld et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , the cf@xmath0 column densities inferred from observations of the orion bar were already a factor of @xmath93 below the predictions of nws05 , and the discrepancy between theory and observation is now increased to more than an order of magnitude .",
    "this disagreement may indicate that we have overestimated the rate coefficient for reaction of c@xmath0 and hf .",
    "we are not aware of any laboratory studies of this reaction ; the rate we adopt is simply the capture rate , and thus an upper limit on the true reaction rate .",
    "laboratory measurements of this key reaction would be very desirable .",

    "ultraviolet absorption studies have led to upper limits , and in one case , a tentative detection toward @xmath3 oph ( federman et al .",

    "the h@xmath11 column density along the @xmath3  oph sight - line requires a @xmath105 , in agreement with previous studies , and the predicted @xmath96 is in good agreement with the observations . the almost exact agreement between the present model and that of vdb86 in regard to the predicted hcl abundance appears to result from the fortuitious cancellation of two changes in the photochemical network : the photodissociation rate for hcl and the photoionization rate for cl are both increased by a factor @xmath38 . as in the vdb86 models ,",
    "the predicted cl@xmath0 column density lies substantially below the observations .",
    "federman et al .  ( 1995 ) attributed this discrepancy to the presence of a significant cl@xmath0 column density within hii regions along the sight - line .",
    "one important caveat must be noted .",
    "the results shown in figure 14 were obtained by assuming a branching ratio of only 10@xmath7 for the production of hcl following dissociative recombination of h@xmath11cl@xmath0 .",
    "this value was initially invoked primarily to _ explain _ the relative low hcl abundance derived from upper limits obtained with the _ copernicus _ satellite .",
    "models that we obtained for other branching ratios ( 0 , 0.3 and 1.0 ) indicate that the hcl column density is linearly proportional to the branching ratio for values greater than 0.1 with a branching ratio of zero ( i.e.  with no production of hcl from dissociative recombination of h@xmath11cl@xmath0 ) , a non - zero but negligible hcl column density ( @xmath106 ) results from the endothermic reaction of h@xmath11 with cl .    in dense clouds",
    ", hcl has been unequivocally detected in several sources by means of submillimeter observations of the @xmath1 emission line .",
    "first detected using the kuiper airborne observatory toward orion ( blake , keene & phillips 1985 ) and then sgr b2 ( zmuidzinas et al .",
    "1995 ) , the @xmath1 transition has also been observed using the ground - based caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) under good atmospheric conditions .",
    "cso observations have led to additional detections toward orion a , mon r2 ( salez , frerking & langer 1996 ) and several other sources ( phillips et al .",
    "2009 ) , as well as mapping observations toward omc-1 ( schilke , phillips & wang 1995 ) .",
    "typical column densities derived for these dense clouds lie in the few @xmath107 to few @xmath108 range , in reasonable agreement with the predictions of our model for regions at high density exposed to strong uv radiation ( fig .",
    "as noted in the observational studies cited above , depletion plays an important role in limiting the fractional abundance of hcl .",
    "our study identifies two additional cl - bearing species that are potentially detectable : the molecular ions hcl@xmath0 and h@xmath11cl@xmath0 .",
    "these ions are isoelectronic with oh and h@xmath11s respectively .",
    "they are most abundant near cloud surfaces , where the photoionization rate for hcl is highest , and show column densities that are an increasing function of @xmath91 .",
    "thus , pdrs subject to strong uv irradiation present attractive targets for searches for hcl@xmath0 and h@xmath11cl@xmath0 at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths .",
    "for example , in a pdr with @xmath74 and @xmath75 , column densities of @xmath109 and @xmath110 are predicted for hcl@xmath0 and h@xmath11cl@xmath0 .",
    "these values apply to sight - lines perpendicular to the illuminated surface ; in edge - on pdrs , they can be significantly enhanced by limb - brightening .",
    "the rotational spectrum of hcl@xmath0 has been measured using laser magnetic spectroscopy ( lubic et al .  1989 ) .",
    "the lowest - lying rotational transition , the @xmath111 multiplet near 207.6@xmath112 m , lies in a wavelength range accessible to the hifi instrument on the _ herschel space observatory_. the rotational spectrum of h@xmath11cl@xmath0 has also been the subject of a laboratory study at high spectral resolution ; here , the measurements of araki et al .",
    "( 2001 ) indicate that the lowest - lying rotational line of ortho - h@xmath11cl@xmath0 , the @xmath113 transition , lie near 189.2 and 188.4 ghz respectively for the @xmath114 and @xmath115 isotopologues .",
    "( these transitions are split into 6 and 4 hyperfine components , covering @xmath116 and @xmath117  mhz respectively . )",
    "this spectral region lies in the wing of the strong 183 ghz telluric water absorption line , but is nevertheless observable from ground - based observatories under favorable  but by no means unusual ",
    "atmospheric conditions . in one of the earliest studies of interstellar chlorine chemistry ,",
    "the possibility of detecting hcl@xmath0 in _ diffuse _ molecular clouds was discussed by jura ( 1974 ) , who considered the @xmath118 band that is accessible in the near - ultraviolet region . given an oscillator strength of @xmath119 for the strongest vibrational band ( pradhan , kirby & dalgarno 1991 ) , and given the abundances predicted in figure 17 , our results for @xmath3  oph would imply equivalent widths of only @xmath120 , well below the limit of detectability .",
    "finally , we note that , unlike cf@xmath0 , the ccl@xmath0 ion is typically predicted to have an extremely low abundance .",
    "although ccl@xmath0 is produced rapidly by reaction of hcl and c@xmath0 , these two species show very little overlap : the hcl abundance is small in the surface layers where c@xmath0 is abundant , unless the temperature is increased by shock heating , and the c@xmath0 abundance is small in the deep cloud interiors where hcl is relatively abundant .",
    "enhanced ccl@xmath0 abundances are possible when shock heating is present along with uv irradiation .",
