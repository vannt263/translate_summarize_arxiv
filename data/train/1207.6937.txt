    "a comprehension of the nature of the scalar mesons is very important for some major topics in particle physics such as the qcd vacuum .",
    "however , both parameters of the scalar mesons , obtained from experimental data in various analyses , and even the status of some of them , are still quite ambiguous  @xcite . as for the meson parameters ,",
    "let us mention the widely discussed @xmath8 meson ( formerly @xmath9 ) , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "a doubtful meson existence can be demonstrated on the case of the @xmath12 state which is apparently required by a bulk of data  @xcite , but in some analyses of only the @xmath4 scattering no evidence for its existence was found  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the existence of the @xmath12 does not contradict the data on @xmath13  @xcite . in the hidden gauge unitary approach ,",
    "the @xmath12 appears dynamically generated as a @xmath14 state  @xcite and the @xmath15 as generated from the @xmath16 interaction .",
    "note also a situation with scalar states in the 1500-mev region . in our previous model - independent analyses of @xmath17",
    ", we observed a wide state @xmath11 whereas in some other analyses , which included mainly meson production and decay processes and which are cited in the pdg tables @xcite , a rather narrow @xmath11 was obtained .",
    "we have suggested that the wide @xmath11 , observed in the multichannel @xmath4 scattering , is effectively a superposition of two states , the wide and narrow state .",
    "the latter is observed only in decays and productions of mesons .",
    "this suggestion was verified in the model - independent two - channel analysis of data on @xmath18  @xcite . in the presented article",
    "we confirm this assumption in the three - channel analysis of data on @xmath1 and decays @xmath2 from the dm2 , mark iii , and bes ii collaborations  @xcite .",
    "this is necessary , especially , as the wide states provoke many questions which should be answered .    in view of this situation related to parameters and the status of the scalar mesons ,",
    "there are still many unsolved problems as to determining a qcd nature of the mesons and their assignment to the quark - model configurations in spite of a big amount of work devoted to these problems ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .    in this article",
    ", we describe the multichannel @xmath4 scattering ( @xmath19 ) using the method based only on the first principles , analyticity and unitarity  @xcite , which allows us to avoid any theoretical prejudice in extracting the resonance parameters .",
    "this we call `` the model - independence ''  @xcite . the method is applied to the analysis of experimental data on the multichannel @xmath4 scattering and decays @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath6 decays are described using a formalism from refs .",
    "@xcite , where certain reasonable assumptions about the final - state interactions are made . considering the obtained arrangement of resonance poles on the riemann - surface sheets , the constants of resonance couplings with the channels , and the resonance masses we can draw definite conclusions about the nature of the investigated states .",
    "the article is organized as follows . a basic formalism for the three - channel model - independent method",
    "was already given in our previous paper @xcite ; therefore , in sec .",
    "ii we give only formulas introducing parameters determined in the analysis .",
    "results of the combined coupled - channel analysis of data on isoscalar @xmath0-wave processes @xmath1 and on decays @xmath2 are presented in sec .",
    "discussion of the results and conclusions are given in sec .",
    "the multichannel @xmath0-matrix can be described in our model - independent method , which essentially utilizes a uniformizing variable , without any approximations only in the two - channel case . in the three - channel case , a four - sheeted model of the eight - sheeted riemann surface",
    "has to be constructed to obtain a simple symmetric ( easily interpreted ) picture of the resonance poles and zeros of the @xmath0 matrix on the uniformization plane .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath20 , where @xmath21 denote the channel numbers , have the right - hand cuts along the real axis of the @xmath22 complex plane ( @xmath22 is the invariant total energy squared ) starting with the channel thresholds @xmath23 and the left - hand cuts related to crossed channels .",
    "an influence of the lowest branch point @xmath24 ( @xmath4 ) is neglected but unitarity on the @xmath4 cut is kept .",
    "sheets of the riemann surface are numbered according to the signs of analytic continuations of the square roots @xmath25 @xmath26 , @xmath27   correspond to sheets i , ii,@xmath28 , viii , respectively .",
    "resonances are described on the riemann surface using the formulas for analytic continuations of the @xmath0-matrix elements to all sheets .",
    "the formulas allow us to express the matrix elements on the unphysical sheets by means of the matrix elements on the physical sheet that have only the resonance zeros ( aside the real axis ) , at least , around the physical region  @xcite . assuming the resonance zeros on sheet i",
    ", we can obtain an arrangement of poles and zeros of the resonance on the whole riemann surface which we denote as a resonance cluster .",
    "in the three - channel case , we obtain _ seven types _ of the resonance clusters corresponding to possible situations when there are resonance zeros on sheet i only in @xmath29  ( * a * ) ;  @xmath30    ( * b * ) ;  @xmath31    ( * c * ) ;  @xmath29 and @xmath30    ( * d * ) ;  @xmath30 and @xmath31    ( * e * ) ;  @xmath29 and @xmath31    ( * f * ) ;  @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31    ( * g * ) .",
    "a three - channel resonance has to be described by one of the seven types of the resonance clusters which is the necessary and sufficient condition for its existence .",
    "the resonances of types ( * a * ) , ( * b * ) and ( * c * ) can be related to the resonances represented by breit - wigner forms but the types ( * d * ) , ( * e * ) , ( * f * ) and ( * g * ) do not have their equivalents in the breit - wigner description .",
    "the cluster type is related to the nature of state .",
    "considering the @xmath4 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 channels , e.g. , a resonance coupled relatively more strongly to the @xmath4 channel than to the @xmath32 and @xmath33 channels is described by the cluster of type ( * a * ) but in the opposite case , the resonance is represented by the cluster of type ( * e * ) ( e.g. , the state with the dominant @xmath34 component ) .",
    "the glueball must be represented by the cluster of type ( * g * ) as a necessary condition for the ideal case .",
    "it is also possible to distinguish , in a model - independent way  @xcite , a bound state of colourless particles ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath32 molecule ) from a @xmath35 bound state .",
    "alike in the one - channel case , the existence of the particle bound state means presence of a pole on the real axis below the threshold on the physical sheet . in the two - channel case , therefore , the existence of the bound state in channel 2 ( e.g. , @xmath32 molecule ) that can decay into channel 1 ( @xmath4 decay ) implies the presence of the pair of complex conjugate poles on sheet ii below the second - channel threshold without the corresponding shifted pair of poles on sheet iii . in the three - channel case ,",
    "the bound state in channel 3 ( @xmath33 ) that can decay into the channels 1 ( @xmath4 decay ) and 2 ( @xmath32 decay ) is represented by the pair of complex conjugate poles on sheet ii and by the pair of shifted poles on sheet iii below the @xmath33 threshold without the corresponding poles on sheets vi and vii .",
    "the formulas of the analytic continuations @xcite prescribe that the resonance parameters ( mass , total width , and coupling constants with the channels ) must be calculated using the pole positions on sheets ii , iv , and viii because only on these sheets do the analytic continuations have the forms : @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively , i.e. , the positions of poles on these sheets are at the same points of the complex - energy plane as the resonance zeros on the physical sheet .",
    "the other pole positions are shifted due to the coupling of channels .",
    "the @xmath0-matrix elements of all coupled processes are expressed in terms of the jost matrix determinant @xmath39 using the le couteur - newton relations @xcite .",
    "the jost determinant is a real analytic function with the only square - root branch points at @xmath40 .",
    "the important branch points , which correspond to the thresholds of the coupled and crossed channels , are taken into account in the uniformizing variable . in the uniformizing variable",
    "used here we neglect the lowest @xmath4-threshold branch point but take into account the threshold branch points related to the two remaining channels , and the left - hand branch point at @xmath41 @xcite @xmath42 here @xmath43 ,  @xmath44 .",
    "this variable maps our model of the eight - sheeted riemann surface onto the uniformization @xmath45 plane divided into two parts by a unit circle centered at the origin .",
    "the semisheets i ( iii ) , ii ( iv ) , v ( vii ) and vi ( viii ) are mapped onto the exterior ( interior ) of the unit disk in the 1st , 2nd , 3rd and 4th quadrants , respectively .",
    "the physical region extends from the @xmath4 threshold @xmath46 on the imaginary axis along this axis down to the point _",
    "i _ on the unit circle ( @xmath32 threshold ) .",
    "then it goes along the unit circle clockwise in the 1st quadrant to point 1 on the real axis ( @xmath33 threshold ) and then along the real axis to the point @xmath47 which is an image of @xmath48 .",
    "the intervals  @xmath49 $ ] , @xmath50 , @xmath51 $ ] , @xmath52 are the images of the corresponding edges of the left - hand cut of the @xmath4-scattering amplitude .",
    "each resonance is represented in @xmath29 by the poles and zeros that are symmetric to each other with respect to the imaginary axis .",
    "the representations of all possible types of resonances in @xmath29 on the @xmath45 plane can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the main model - independent effect of multichannel resonances is given by the pole clusters .",
    "assuming that possible small remaining ( model - dependent ) contributions of resonances can be included via the background , the @xmath0-matrix elements are taken as the products @xmath53 [ d_res ] where @xmath54 describes the background and @xmath55 the resonance contributions .    on the @xmath45 plane ,",
    "the le couteur - newton relations are somewhat modified taking account of the used model of the initial eight - sheeted riemann surface @xmath56 where the subscripts in the matrix elements @xmath20 denote the channels : @xmath571@xmath4 ,  2@xmath32 ,  3@xmath33 .",

    "these thresholds are determined in the analysis .",
    "the expressions ( [ lecouteur - newton ] ) and ( [ dw_res ] ) provide the simplest possible parametrization of the resonance part of the @xmath0 matrix for a given number and type of resonances on the uniformization @xmath45 plane keeping unitarity and analyticity .",
    "the free parameters ( the zeros @xmath68 ) of the @xmath55 with a particular number and type of resonances , are fixed by fitting to the experimental data . the scenario with the smallest @xmath69",
    "is chosen as the most probable hypothesis on the condition of the given data set .",
    "note that this is an opposite approach to that , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite where the @xmath0 matrix is constructed in the physical region and then it is analytically continued to the riemann surface to find poles , for example the @xmath70-meson pole . in our approach",
    ", positions of the poles are obtained directly from the fitting .",
    "an optimal number of poles is the minimal number which guarantees a satisfactory description of the data and which contains only the poles significantly improving the fit .",
    "the poles are introduced according to the formulas for analytic continuations of the @xmath0-matrix elements to all sheets @xcite .",
    "the background part @xmath71 is constructed in the physical region to mimic an influence of the other singularities not included explicitly in the resonance part @xmath55 . the simple form in eq.([dbackground ] )",
    "includes a response to the opening of the channels whose threshold branch points are not taken into account explicitly in the uniformizing variable .",
    "values of the fitted parameters in eq.([dbackground ] ) ( @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) indicate a relative importance of these branch points , e.g. a negative or large value of some background parameter could suggests that the corresponding branch point should be explicitely allowed for in the uniformizing variable .",
    "therefore , in choosing the best variant we also require that the background contribution is negligible , i.e. , the background parameters are small .    in our previous analysis of data on @xmath18 we took into account the left - hand branch point at @xmath41 in the uniformizing variable in addition to the @xmath4- and @xmath32-threshold branch points",
    "@xcite . in the analysis of",
    "@xmath1 we allowed rather for the @xmath33-threshold branch point @xcite .",
    "in the presented more elaborate three - channel analysis , unlike in ref .",
    "@xcite , we follow more consistently the spirit of the model - independent description obtaining practically zero background of the @xmath4 scattering .",
    "in the combined analysis of data on the isoscalar @xmath0 waves of processes @xmath19 @xcite we added data on decays @xmath2 from the mark iii @xcite , dm2 @xcite and bes ii @xcite collaborations .",
    "formalism for calculating the di - meson mass distributions of these decays can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this approach",
    "the pairs of the pseudoscalar mesons in the final states are assumed to have @xmath74 and they undergo strong interactions whereas the @xmath75 meson behaves as a spectator .",
    "the amplitudes for @xmath2 decays are related with the scattering amplitudes @xmath76 @xmath77 as follows : @xmath78,\\ ] ] @xmath79,\\ ] ] where   @xmath80 and @xmath81 are functions of the couplings of the @xmath6 to channels 1 and 2 ; @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 are free parameters .",
    "the pole term in @xmath86 approximates possible @xmath87 states which are not forbidden by the ozi rules considering quark diagrams of these processes .",
    "obviously this pole should be situated on the real @xmath22-axis below the @xmath4 threshold .",
    "this is an effective inclusion of the effect of so - called `` crossed channel final - state interactions '' in @xmath88 , which was studied largely , e.g. , in ref .",
    "the di - meson mass distributions are given as @xmath89 where @xmath90 is a normalization constant to data of the experiments determined in the analysis : 0.7512 , 0.2783 , and 5.699 for the mark iii , dm2 , and bes ii data , respectively .",

    "moreover , it was found that the data admit two sets of parameters of @xmath5 with a mass relatively near to the @xmath105-meson mass , and with the total widths either @xmath106 or @xmath107  mev , solutions a and b , respectively , like in ref .  @xcite .    in the extended combined analysis , adding the data on decays @xmath2 , one can prefer the scenarios when the @xmath12 is described by the cluster of type ( * b * ) and @xmath108 by the cluster of type either ( * b * ) or ( * c * ) . to be specific , in the following",
