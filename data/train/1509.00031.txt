    "cosmic inflation @xcite is a theory of the early universe which predicts cosmic acceleration and generation of seeds of the large scale structure of the present universe .",
    "it solves problems of classical cosmology and it is consistent with current experimental data @xcite .",
    "it is instructive to study minimal models of inflation which have the form of small modifications of the canonical models describing features of the visible universe .",
    "two most prominent examples of such models are , at the moment , @xmath0 theories of gravity models of higgs inflation .",
    "the first theory of inflation was the starobinsky model @xcite , which is an @xmath0 theory @xcite with @xmath1 lagrangian density .",
    "in such a model the acceleration of space - time is generated by the gravitational interaction itself , without a need to introduce any new particles or fields .",
    "the embedding of starobinsky inflation in no - scale sugra has been discussed in ref .",
    "the starobinsky inflation can be described as a special case of the brans - dicke theory @xcite and its predictions are consistent with the so - called higgs inflation @xcite , in which inflation is generated by the scalar field non - minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "recently the whole class of generalisations of the starobinsky and higgs inflation have been discussed in the literature @xcite , also in the context of the higher order terms in starobinsky jordan frame potential @xcite .",
    "+ on the other hand , higgs inflation allows one to generate inflation close to the higgs sector .",
    "the price is the non - minimal coupling to gravity and often additional interactions which allow one to reproduce all features of realistic inflationary scenarios .",
    "in particular , corrections to the model can often be represented by higher order scalar operators .",
    "this reminds one of the situation known from @xmath0 theories , where higher order corrections to the f(r ) function seem to be unavoidable .",
    "usually one assumes that there is a part of the starobinsky / higgs inflationary potential where higher order terms are subdominant , which creates an inflationary plateau long enough to support successful inflation .",
    "nevertheless one can find a part of parameter space where higher order corrections give significant contribution to the potential for relatively small values of field , which makes the plateau region too short to generate cosmic inflation with at least 60 e - foldings . in this case",
    "a saddle point inflation generated by the higher order terms may be the only chance to obtain a successful inflationary model , which is the issue we investigate in this paper .",
    "+ in @xcite we proved that the starobinsky potential with higher order corrections ( i.e. higher powers of the jordan frame starobisnky potential ) can have a saddle point for some @xmath2 on the plateau .",
    "this requires a certain relation between parameters of the model and leads to the existence of the starobinsky plateau , a step slope of exponential potential and a saddle point in between . in this paper",
    "we perform the detailed analysis of such a model in the context of low - scale inflation and generation of primordial inhomogeneities , especially in the context of very big values of higher order terms .",
    "we apply the same approach to the higgs inflation . in this case",
    "the motivation is even more natural : higher order corrections to the scalar potential ( such as @xmath3 or @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a scalar field , but not necessarily the higgs field itself ) are considered to be suppressed by the planck scale .",
    "consequently for sufficiently high values of field @xmath5 one has to take into account the influence of higher order terms . in particular higher order terms coefficients",
    "could be fine - tuned to create a saddle point ( or deflation point ) in the einstein frame scalar potential . in ref @xcite we have also investigated the saddle - point inflation in @xmath0 theory generated by higher order corrections to the starobinsky model .",
    "note that in this paper we investigate the issue of higher order corrections to jordan frame scalar potentials , not to the @xmath0 function itself .",

    "we found the region in the @xmath194 space which fits the @xmath136 regime of planck .",
    "we showed how @xmath103 ( and therefore the scale of inflation ) can decrease for big @xmath26 and we estimated the maximal allowed value of @xmath26 to be of order of @xmath195 .",
    "the inflation can happen almost exactly at the inflection point and no starobinsky plateau is needed to obtain correct shape of the power spectrum . for @xmath134 consistency with planck can be obtained even for @xmath196 .",
    "in such a case one obtains the starobinsky plateau for @xmath112 , which has significant influence on the generation of primordial inhomogeneities during the last 60 e - folds of inflation .",
    "[ sec : higgs ] we investigated the issue of higher order corrections to the @xmath197 potential .",
    "we found conditions for the existence of a saddle point as well as constrains in the @xmath198 plane , which come from perturbativity of the theory and consistency with planck .",
    "the result is that the saddle point inflation is possible in such a model .",
    "however during the last 60 e - folds of inflation , interesting part of the potential is also influenced by the @xmath197 term , which generates starobinsky - like plateau .",
    "this comes from the fact that in the allowed region of parameters @xmath199 , which means that inflation has to proceed on the plateau some distance from the saddle , in order to satisfy experimental constraints .",
