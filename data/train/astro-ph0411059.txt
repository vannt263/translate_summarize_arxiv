    "given the role of type ia supernovae as distance indicators for cosmology and main producers of heavy elements in the universe , understanding the physics of their explosions and how it influences observables is one of the most fundamental issues in modern astrophysics .",
    "one of the keys to penetrate into the secrets of sn  ia physics is to explore the origin of their diversity .    during the last decade a new paradigm for sne  ia was developed . in particular , a correlation between the peak luminosity and the shape of the early light curve was found , with brighter objects having a slower rate of decline than dimmer ones ( phillips 1993 ; phillips et al . 1999 , hereinafter p99 ) .",
    "this is matched by a spectroscopic sequence , defined by the ratio of the depth of two absorption features of siii at 5972 and 6355   ( typically observed at 5800 and 6150  , respectively ) @xcite .",
    "this ratio , @xmath1(siii ) , also correlates with the absolute magnitude of sne  ia and , in turn , with the rate of decline .",
    "spectral modeling indicates that most of the spectral differences are caused by variations in the effective temperatures which , in the context of chandrasekhar - mass explosions , can be interpreted in terms of a variation in the mass of @xmath3ni produced in the explosions .",
    "+ alternatively , @xcite , using synthetic spectra , tentatively suggest that in sn  1999by and , in general , in sne  ia with @xmath2(b)@xmath4 the 5800   feature is mostly due to tiii transitions rather than to siii .",
    "although a one - parameter description of sne ia has proved to be very useful , it does not completely account for the observed diversity of sne  ia , ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite showed that , contrary to expectations , @xmath1(siii ) correlates poorly with the photospheric velocity deduced from the si  ii @xmath5 absorption . to account for this",
    ", they suggested that two or more explosion mechanisms are required to explain sn  ia variety .",
    "furthermore , some sne  ia with normal spectra ( i.e. showing only lines of typical ions ) were noticed to show exceptionally high absorption line blueshifts @xcite .",
    "finally , no correlation was found between the blueshift of the si  ii 6355 absorption at the time of maximum brightness and the decline rate parameter , @xmath2(b ) , in a small sample of well - observed sne ia ( see also patat et al .",
    "1996 ) .    in this paper we further explore this issue , using detailed observations of a large sample of sne  ia",
    "the sample used in this work consists of 26 well - studied sne ia .",
    "it includes ( branch-)normal sne @xcite as well as extreme events like sne 1991 t and 1991bg .",
    "photometric parameters such as @xmath2(b ) , extinction and apparent magnitude at maximum are from p99 or alternatively from @xcite .",
    "the spectral parameters have been ( re-)measured homogeneously on the available spectra , most of which are published although unpublished material collected in the asiago supernova archive ( asa ) by the padua - asiago sn group and the european supernova collaboration was also used . in table",
    "[ tab1 ] we summarize the main photometric and spectroscopic parameters of the sn  ia sample , together with the morphological type ( t ) of the host galaxy as given in rc3 .",
    "the sne are divided into three groups according to the criteria discussed in sect .",
    "[ exp ] . in each group",
    "the sne are arranged by decreasing @xmath6 ( see sect .",
    "[ exp ] ) .",
    "the expansion velocity of the ejecta gives a direct indication of the kinetic energy of the explosion .",
    "the blue - shift of the siii @xmath7 absorption , the most prominent line in the photospheric phase spectrum , traces the evolution of the expansion velocity of the ejecta over the first 4 - 5 weeks past explosion .",
    "a plot of the time evolution of the expansion velocity , v(si ) for the sne  ia of our sample ( figure 1 ) confirms the results of @xcite . at",
    "any given phase , expansion velocities span a wide range of @xmath8kms@xmath9 , from the very rapidly expanding ejecta of sne  1983 g and 1997bp to the low velocity , sn  1991bg - like events . between these limits both",
    "the `` branch normal '' sne  ia and the luminous sn  1991t - like events are found .",
    "a convenient parameter to distinguish different sne  ia is the expansion velocity measured 10 days past maximum , @xmath10(siii ) . as we mentioned earlier",
    ", this parameter correlates poorly with @xmath1(siii ) @xcite or with @xmath2(b ) @xcite , hence it may give interesting clues for origin of sn  ia diversity .    upon a more careful scrutiny , and",
    "thanks to the excellent coverage offered by the new data , it can be noticed that the velocities show not only a spread in value , but also significant differences in velocity evolution . in particular , a sub - group of very homogeneous sne  ia , characterized by a shallow evolution of the expansion velocity ( open symbols in fig .",
    "1 ) , populates a narrow strip in the post - maximum velocity evolution diagram . for a quantitative analysis",
    "we introduce a new parameter , @xmath11v/@xmath12 t , which is the average daily rate of decrease of the expansion velocity ( tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] , col .",
    "this is derived from least squares fits of the measurements taken between maximum and either the time the siii feature disappears or the last available spectrum , whichever is earlier .",
    "on average , the low ( temporal ) velocity gradient ( lvg ) sne  ia have a velocity gradient @xmath13 kms@xmath9d@xmath9 .",
    "the sne  ia shown as filled symbols have a larger @xmath14 kms@xmath9d@xmath9 , reaching 110 - 125 kms@xmath9d@xmath9   for sne  2002bo , 1991bg , and 1983 g ( although the value for sn  1983 g is quite uncertain ) .",
    "a similar dichotomy in velocity slopes between sne  ia can be found in the velocities deduced from the sii @xmath15 line , this time at pre - maximum phases ( see figure 11 of @xcite ) .    for an objective identification of possibly homogeneous groups",
    ", we performed a hierarchical cluster analysis for the sn  ia sample of table [ tab1 ] , considering both photometric and spectroscopic parameters , but neglecting the dependence on galaxy morphological type .",
    "hierarchical cluster analysis @xcite is an exploratory data analysis tool which aims to identify relatively homogeneous groups of events based on selected characteristics , using an algorithm that starts with each case in a separate cluster and combines clusters until only one is left .",
    "cluster analysis simply discovers structures in data without explaining why they exist .",
    "the choice of the number of clusters to be considered is somewhat arbitrary although a criterion is the distance of the groups in the parameter space .",
    "+ indeed , in the five dimensions space we found three well separated clusters :    a ) : :    a first cluster ( faint ) consists of faint sne  ia , with    @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) , similar to sn    1991bg .",
    "all these sne have a high post - maximum luminosity decline    rate ,    @xmath18@xmath2(b)@xmath19    ( @xmath20 ) , and siii line ratio ,    @xmath18@xmath1(siii)@xmath21=0.58    ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "they have small expansion velocities ,    @xmath18@xmath10(siii)@xmath21=9.2    ( @xmath17 ) , and a large velocity gradient ,    @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "b ) : :    a second group consists of `` normal '' sne  ia with high velocity    gradient ( hvg ) , @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "these sne have average absolute magnitude    @xmath27 ,    @xmath2(b)=@xmath28    ( @xmath29 ) , and    @xmath18@xmath1(siii)@xmath21=0.20    ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "they typically have high expansion    velocities ,    @xmath18@xmath10(siii)@xmath21=12.2    ( @xmath30 ) .",

    "although    its post - maximum decline rate is somewhat slower than that of the hvg    sne , @xmath18@xmath2(b)@xmath21=1.1    ( @xmath33 ) , its average luminosity is similar :    @xmath34 , and so is their    @xmath18@xmath1(siii)@xmath21=0.25    ( @xmath35 ) . on average ,",
    "the lvg sne have lower and    more homogeneous expansion velocities than the hvg sne ,    @xmath18@xmath10(siii)@xmath21=10.3    ( @xmath36 ) .    for a few events , in particular sne 1989b and 1992a ,",
    "cluster membership is uncertain . a small variation of the parameters , still within the errors , could shift them from the lvg to the hvg group .",
    "it is also interesting that on average the host galaxy morphological type is progressively later as one moves from faint to hvg and to lvg .",
    "the average values are @xmath37 , 0.6 , and 2.5 , respectively .",
    "the dispersion within each group is however very large ( @xmath38 ) .",

    "@xcite , using synow synthetic spectra , tentatively suggest that in sn  1999by and , in general , in sne  ia with @xmath2(b)@xmath4 the 5800   feature is mostly due to tiii transitions rather than to siii , and claim that only with this interpretation can the @xmath1(siii)@xmath149 ",
    "@xmath2(b )  relation be understood .",
    "+ however , neither our synthetic spectral analysis of sn  1991bg @xcite , nor the spectral tomography analysis of the normal sn  ia , sn  2002bo exploring a wide range of photospheric temperatures and chemical compositions @xcite , requires a relevant contribution from the tiii transitions to fit the 5800   feature .",
    "indeed , in the above mentioned models , the 5800   feature is always well fitted by the siii 5972   transition . + as for the sne  ia with @xmath2(b)@xmath150 , @xcite confirm that the 5800   feature is indeed siii .",

    "the expansion velocity evolution gradient , @xmath6 , seems to be weakly correlated with @xmath2(b ) : while sne with a large @xmath2(b )  ( the faint group ) have a large @xmath6 , normal sne can have both a large or a small @xmath6 .",
    "cluster analysis however suggests that we are dealing with three distinct families of sne  ia : faint , lvg , and hvg .",
    "these three groups may be characterized by different physical parameters governing the same explosion mechanism ( possibly distinguishing lvg and hvg ) or by a totally different kind of explosion , which may be the case especially for the faint group .",
    "based on the evidence presented above , we can make a preliminary attempt to explain the causes of the spectroscopic diversity among sne  ia .    as",
    "figures 1,2 and 3 show , sne  ia can be divided into three groups .",
    "each group has distinct physical properties , different from those of other groups .",
    "in particular , the faint group ( essentially the sn  1991bg - like objects , plus sne  1986 g and 1993h according to this method - but see @xcite for an infrared view ) clearly differs from the other two : these sne are fast decliners in both luminosity and velocity , they have typically low velocities and occur in earlier - type galaxies .",
    "this may be not surprising , since in many ways sn  1991bg  like objects stand out as odd .    for the other two groups ,",
    "the situation is more complicated : both hvg and lvg include normal sne , but the lvg include also all the brightest , slowest declining sne .",
    "our analysis suggests that lvg and hvg are two distinct groups , but they may possibly represent a continuum of properties .",
    "interestingly , although it is common to refer to two main groups of peculiar sne  ia , sn  1991bg and sn  1991t  like , the latter sne fall in the same class as normal sne , while the former do not .",
    "there appears to be a discontinuity of properties between sn  1991bg - like objects and all other sne  ia , which is not seen for sn  1991t  like sne .",
    "this is not what we might expect if sne  ia behaved as a simple one - parameter family of events .",
    "based on a qualitative analysis @xcite suggested that the large blueshift of the siii line in sn  2002bo ( a hvg sn ) maybe the result of a delayed detonation explosion .",
    "moreover , @xcite find , from detailed non - lte calculations , that some delayed - detonation models can account for the very high siii blueshift of another hvg , sn  1984a .",
    "it may be that the hvg sne are delayed - detonations , their internal dispersion arising from a range of transition densities , while the lvg sne are deflagrations .",
    "this would be an extension of the results of @xcite ( see their figure 1 ) .",
    "the only difference with their conclusions would be that sne  1981b and 1992a would become a delayed - detonation and a deflagration event , respectively .",
    "from spectropolarimetric studies @xcite also reached the conclusion that the explosion mechanism of sne  1984a , 1997bp , 2002bo ( all hvg sne ) and of sn  2004dt , which is most probably also a hvg sn , may be markedly different from that of lower velocity objects such as sn  1994d .",
    "the lvg include all three sne in our sample with @xmath2(b)@xmath151 : sne  1991 t , 1999cw and 1999ee .",
    "sn  1991 t has also often been discussed as the result of a delayed detonation , especially in order to explain the high abundance of @xmath3ni and its decay products at the highest velocities @xcite , so its inclusion in the lvg does not support the hypothesis that all lvg are deflagrations .",
    "very early measurements of @xmath152(si ) are not possible for sn  1991 t , since the siii line was almost absent in the earliest spectra owing to the high degree of ionization .",
    "the photospheric velocities inferred from spectral models were however very high @xcite .",
    "this might support the suggestion made by @xcite that sn  1991t - like events could be 1984a - like events viewed at different angles ( and thus hvgs ) .",
    "more efficient mixing out of heavy elements might result in an initially higher photospheric velocity . at the earliest times",
    "the photosphere should in fact tend to trace the heavier elements , since they have much larger line opacity and this is the major contributor to the optical depth @xcite",
    ". the initial rate of decrease of the velocity with time would consequently be larger , as the photosphere moves inward to layers that are not so different from those of less mixed sne .",
    "this would also mean an initially lower temperature ( resulting from the large photosphere ) but increasing with time .",
    "this would be the hvg group .",
    "on the other hand , less efficient mixing could lead to initially smaller photospheric velocities : light elements contribute much less to the opacity and thus the photosphere would be deeper and the pre - maximum temperature higher . the decline rate of the velocity would then be smaller , and the temperature would either stay constant or decline , depending on the exact combination of increasing luminosity and decreasing photospheric velocity .",
    "these are the properties of the lvg .",
    "very high - velocity features have been observed in all sne with sufficiently early spectra ( mazzali et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "maybe in the lvg the interaction affects the spectra only very early , as in sn  1999ee @xcite or sn  1990n @xcite , and there is a sudden drop to lower velocities when the interaction ends , resulting in a lower post - maximum @xmath6 , while it continues for a longer time in the hvg , so that @xmath10(siii )  spans a broader range of values .",
