    "systematic errors in lattice simulations include not only finite - size and discretization effects , dependence on the chiral extrapolation and quenching , but also systematic effects due to contamination from higher excited states in the calculation of energy levels ( masses ) of quark bound states .",
    "this is because masses and decay constants are computed in lattice qcd from the exponential decay of euclidean correlation functions @xmath2 , which are built from composite fields with the quantum numbers of a given state ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "more precisely , in the simulation , one evolves gluon fields ( the link variables @xmath3 ) in the monte carlo dynamics associated with the partition function @xmath4 & = & \\int { \\cal d}u \\,e^{-s_g}\\,\\det k(u)\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the gluonic action and @xmath6 is the dirac operator .",
    "( the quenched approximation corresponds to @xmath7 . )",
    "although the quark fields @xmath8 are not evolved directly , information about them may be obtained once the link configuration is produced , since quark propagators are given by @xmath9 i.e.  by computing the inverse of @xmath6 for each configuration of the link variables and averaging over the configurations produced .",
    "similarly , the computed inverse of @xmath6 may be used to build interpolators , i.e.  products of creation and annihilation operators with the quantum numbers of the desired bound state and a good overlap with the hadron wave function on the lattice . the result",
    "is then averaged over the configurations to yield the ( euclidean ) correlators @xmath2 as @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the appropriate dirac matrix ( e.g.  @xmath13 for pseudoscalar mesons ) .",
    "finally , one determines masses and decay constants by identifying the various contributions to the spectral decomposition @xmath14 where @xmath15 are eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( i.e.  the logarithm of the transfer matrix ) and all energies @xmath16 have the vacuum energy subtracted . also , we assume hermitean operators and a large enough time extent of the lattice to yield the simple exponential form above . at large @xmath17",
    "we expect to observe a plateau in the `` effective mass ''",
    "@xmath18 \\,\\;\\to\\;\\ , e_1 \\,+\\,{\\cal o}({e}^{-(e_2-e_1)t})\\,,\\ ] ] in such a way that the true ground - state energy @xmath19 may be estimated .    clearly , determining masses and decay constants from the correlators in eq .  (",
    "[ eq : corr2 ] ) is not an easy task . to see this ,",
    "consider the first correction above , given by @xmath20\\,$ ] with a positive coefficient , in the case of a heavy - light system . for typical energy differences of a few hundred mev",
    ", a plateau can only be reached for @xmath21 around 1 fm , but by then the signal has started to compete with noise , even for improved static - quark discretizations .",
    "this is a general problem and trying to determine subleading corrections by multiple - exponential fits leads to large systematic errors .",
    "one alternative is to use more sophisticated fitting methods , such as bayesian fitting , evolutionary fitting and nmr - inspired methods .",
    "another way to ensure better precision is inspired by the variational method in quantum mechanics and consists in increasing the basis of interpolators to build a matrix of correlators @xmath22 , for which a generalized eigenvalue problem ( gevp ) is formulated ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "one then considers all - to - all propagators @xcite instead of simple point sources as indicated in eq .",
    "[ eq : corr ] .",
    "the gevp is a valuable tool to reduce systematic errors in the above determinations , and thus to deliver high - precision tests of qcd .",
    "we summarize the derivation of an optimal use of the method in section [ method ] below and describe its application to spectrum calculations of @xmath0 mesons in nonperturbative hqet to order @xmath1 in section [ hqet ] .",
    "the gevp is defined by @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath2 is now a matrix of correlators , given by @xmath25 the chosen interpolators @xmath26 are taken ( hopefully ) linearly independent , e.g.  they may be built from smeared quark fields using @xmath27 different smearing levels .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath28 are defined by @xmath29    one thus computes @xmath30 for the interpolator basis @xmath26 from the numerical simulation , then gets effective energy levels @xmath31 and estimates for the matrix elements @xmath28 from the solution @xmath32 of the gevp at large @xmath21 . for the energies",
    "@xmath33 it is shown @xcite that @xmath34 converges exponentially as @xmath35 ( and fixed @xmath36 ) to the true energy @xmath16 .",
    "however , since the exponential falloff of higher contributions may be slow , it is also essential to study the convergence as a function of @xmath36 in order to achieve the required efficiency for the method .",
    "this has been done in @xcite , by explicit application of ( ordinary ) perturbation theory to a hypothetical truncated problem where only @xmath27 levels contribute .",
    "the solution in this case is exactly given by the true energies , and corrections due to the higher states are treated perturbatively .",
    "we get    @xmath37    for the energies and @xmath38 for the eigenstates of the hamiltonian , which may be estimated through @xmath39 r_n & = & { \\left(v_n(t , t_0)\\,,\\ , c(t)\\,v_n(t , t_0)\\right)}^{-1/2 } \\ ; \\left[{\\lambda_n(t_0+a , t_0 ) \\over \\lambda_n(t_0 + 2a , t_0)}\\right]^{t/2}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    , @xmath36 yields conversion to the asymptotic state controlled by a much larger energy gap than usual ( i.e.  the one represented by the longer arrow instead of the shorter one).,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    in our analysis we see that , due to cancellations of @xmath21-independent terms in the effective energy , the first - order corrections in @xmath40 are independent of @xmath36 and very strongly suppressed at large @xmath21 .",
    "we identify two regimes : 1 ) for @xmath41 , the 2nd - order corrections dominate and their exponential suppression is given by the smallest energy gap @xmath42 between level @xmath43 and its neighboring levels @xmath44 ; and 2 ) for @xmath45 , the 1st - order corrections dominate and the suppression is given by the large gap @xmath46 .",
    "amplitudes @xmath47 get main contributions from the first - order corrections . for fixed @xmath48 these are also suppressed with @xmath46 .",
    "clearly , the appearance of large energy gaps in the second regime improves convergence significantly . a pictorial illustration of the improvement in shown in fig .  [ levelsplot ] .",
    "we therefore work with @xmath21 , @xmath36 combinations in this regime .",
    "a very important step of our approach is to realize that the same perturbative analysis may be applied to get the leading corrections to correlators in an effective theory , such as corrections of order @xmath1 to the static case in hqet correlation functions .",
    "these are given by @xmath49 where the combined @xmath50 corrections are symbolized by the expansion parameter @xmath51 .",
    "following the same procedure as above , we get similar exponential suppressions ( with the static energy gaps ) for static and @xmath50 terms in the effective theory .",
    "we arrive at @xmath52 with @xmath53      e_n^{\\rm eff,\\first}(t , t_0 ) & = &      e_n^{\\first } \\,+\\ , [ \\,\\beta_n^{\\first }      \\,-\\ , \\beta_n^{\\stat}\\,t\\;\\delta e_{n+1,n}^{\\first}\\ , ]      { e}^{-\\delta e_{n+1,n}^{\\stat}\\ , t}+\\ldots\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and similarly for matrix elements .    an application of the methods described in this section is discussed next .",
    "high - precision hadronic matrix elements are a key ingredient as theoretical inputs in b physics and are ideally obtained from lattice - qcd simulations . however , currently used lattices are not large enough to represent simultaneously the low - energy scale of @xmath54 , which requires a large physical lattice size , and the high - energy scale of the heavy - quark mass @xmath55 , which requires a very small lattice spacing @xmath56 .",
    "a promising alternative is to consider ( lattice ) heavy - quark effective theory ( hqet ) , which allows for an elegant theoretical treatment , with the possibility of fully nonperturbative renormalization @xcite .",
    "hqet provides a valid low - momentum description for systems with one heavy quark , with manifest heavy - quark symmetry in the static limit . the heavy - quark flavor and spin symmetries are broken at finite values of @xmath55 respectively by kinetic and spin terms , with first - order [ i.e.  @xmath50 ] corrections to the static lagrangian incorporated by an expansion of the statistical weight in @xmath1 , such that the symmetry - breaking operators are treated as insertions into static correlation functions .",
    "this guarantees the existence of a continuum limit , with results that are independent of the regularization , provided that the renormalization be done nonperturbatively .",
    "masses and decay constants are expanded as sums of a static and an @xmath50 contribution , in terms of the parameters of the effective theory and of the bare energies and matrix elements , which are computed in the numerical simulation .",
    "the divergences ( with inverse powers of @xmath56 ) in these parameters are cancelled through the nonperturbative renormalization , which is based on matching the hqet parameters to qcd on lattices of small physical volume  where fine lattice spacings can be considered  and extrapolating to a large volume by the step - scaling method .",
    "this analysis has been recently completed for the quenched case @xcite . using the computed hqet parameters , we have carried out a study @xcite ( see also @xcite ) of spectrum and decay constants for @xmath0 mesons applying the gevp method as described in the previous section .",
    "we have employed two lattice actions for the static quark , lattices of spatial extent @xmath58 fm with three lattice spacings and all - to - all strange - quark propagators constructed from approximate low modes , with 100 configurations .",
    "the interpolating fields were obtained from a simple @xmath59 structure and 8 levels of gaussian smearing for the strange - quark field .",
    "the resulting ( @xmath60 ) correlation matrix may be conveniently truncated to an @xmath61 one and the gevp solved for each @xmath27 , so that results can be studied as a function of @xmath27 .",
    "we have used two methods for picking a basis from the above interpolators and checked that both yielded the same results .",
    "the combined use of nonperturbatively determined hqet parameters and efficient gevp solution allowed us to reach a precision of a few percent in matrix elements and of a few mev in energy levels , even with only a moderate number of configurations .",
    "a corresponding study for the @xmath62 case is in progress .",
