    "there are many uncertainties left for the hadron - quark phase transition , e.g.  the equation of state ( eos ) of quark matter or deconfinement mechanism . assuming the quark deconfinement transition to be of the first order , since there are two conserved quantities , baryon number and electric charge , the phase equilibrium in the mixed phase must be carefully treated by applying the gibbs conditions @xcite , instead of the maxwell construction",
    ". a simple treatment of the mixed phase may be the bulk gibbs calculation , where phase equilibrium of two bulk matter is considered without electromagnetic interaction and surface tension .",
    "generally the properties of the mixed phase should strongly depend on electromagnetic interaction and surface tension , and these effects , sometimes called  _ the finite - size effects _ \" , lead to the non - uniform  pasta \" structures .",
    "the eos of the mixed phase becomes similar to the one by the bulk gibbs calculation for weak surface tension , and to the one given by the maxwell construction for strong surface tension  @xcite .",
    "the charge screening is also important for their mechanical instability . in this paper , we study the hadron - quark mixed phase with the finite - size effects at finite temperature by extending the previous works  @xcite .",
    "we also present some results for the neutrino - trapping case and discuss its effect .",
    "the theoretical framework for the hadronic phase of matter is the nonrelativistic brueckner - hartree - fock approach including hyperons such as @xmath0 and @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "there is a controversy about the @xmath0-@xmath2 interaction .",
    "the recent experimental result about hypernuclei has suggested that it is repulsive  @xcite , while we use here a weak but attractive interaction ; @xmath0 then appears before @xmath1 in uniform and neutral matter . it would be interesting to see how our results are changed by using different @xmath0-@xmath2 interaction , and we will discuss it in the future work .",

    "the instability by finite temperature mainly comes from the correlation energy , while the effects of neutrinos on free energy appear both in the correlation energy and the coulomb energy .",

    "however , in the middle stage of evolution of proto - neutron stars , the pasta structure will appear , where initial cooling and deleptonization proceed .",
    "hence , the simple maxwell condition might be enough to take into account the quark - hadron phase transitions in the simulations of supernovae or black hole formations , although such treatment is inappropriate in the simulations of proto - neutron star evolutions .",
