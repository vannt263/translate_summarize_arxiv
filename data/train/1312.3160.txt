    "processes of accelerating particles have been a subject of large interest in recent years .",
    "billiards are systems widely used to study these processes due to their adaptability to several situations by exploiting different mechanisms .",
    "a billiard is a system where a particle ( or more ) collides with boundaries while it interacts , or not , with some potentials .",
    "these boundaries can be static or time dependent , as well as the potentials .",
    "billiards systems usually present , mathematically speaking , a nonlinear term and their phase spaces exhibit a rich variety of behaviours including , but not limited to , chaotic trajectories and quasi - periodic orbits .",
    "the studies include : ( i ) the non - dissipative case , where dissipation due to friction , drag or inelastic collisions is absent , and ; ( ii ) the dissipative case , where _ usually _ the islands of regular motion give place to attractors and , depending on parameters , the chaotic sea becomes a chaotic attractor or eventually , a chaotic transient . moreover ,",
    "depending on perturbation , the particle can present a power - law energy growth , that is suppressed by weak linear dissipation , or a robust exponential energy growth .",
    "the phenomena where a classical particle acquires unbounded energy when it is excited by an external driving structure is called fermi acceleration ( fa ) .",
    "the studies of fa are risen since the first half of 20th century , when high energy cosmic rays were observed .",
    "the basic mechanism of acceleration was proposed by enrico fermi @xcite and it consists of the interaction of the cosmic ray with time dependent magnetic fields generated by the activity of galaxies nuclei . such interaction was claimed to be the responsible for giving the high energy to the particle .",
    "fermi s idea can be placed in terms of a classical model .",
    "indeed it is similar to the problem of a particle colliding against a rigid and a moving walls .",
    "the particle corresponds to the cosmic ray while the moving wall represents the driving provided by the time dependent magnetic fields .",
    "ulam @xcite was who proposed this model , where a particle moves in absence of any external field and dissipation between collisions with the walls .",
    "the fixed wall works as a mechanism to re - inject the particle back for further collisions with the moving wall .",
    "such a model , known as fermi - ulam model ( fum ) is described by a two - dimensional and area preserving mapping .",
    "the amplitude of oscillation of the moving wall defines the strength of the nonlinear term . for non null amplitude of oscillation",
    ", the phase space of the fum presents mixed structure , where regions of chaotic motion coexist with kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) islands and invariant tori , also called as invariant spanning curves or invariant rotational curves .",
    "moreover , these spanning curves limit the energy gain for a chaotic orbit , prohibiting an unlimited diffusion in the velocity axis .",
    "therefore , fa is not achieved in fum , as it was discussed by lichtenberg _",
    "_ @xcite .    a variation of fum called as bouncer regards the dynamics of a classical particle moving in the presence of a constant gravitational field and suffering elastic collisions with a periodically moving wall .",
    "the re - injection mechanism is now produced by the gravitational field . for specific sets of control parameter and initial conditions",
    ", the bouncer model @xcite indeed presents fa . for small non null amplitude of oscillation of the platform",
    "the phase space presents small regions of chaotic motion , islands of regular motion and invariant spanning curves that prevent the particle to gain unlimited energy . consistently with kam theorem ,",
    "invariant spanning curves are continually destroyed as the amplitude of oscillation increases until all of them disappear . as a consequence ,",
    "the chaotic component of phase space becomes open and the average velocity of the particle grows unlimitedly leading to fa .",
    "_ @xcite demonstrated that the bouncer model is globally equivalent to the chirikov s standard map , explained the origin of fa and , moreover , obtained the combinations of initial conditions and values of parameter where the accelerating modes are observed in the bouncer model .",
    "concerning fa in two - dimensional time dependent billiards , it was conjectured by loskutov , ryabov and akinshin that a sufficient condition for the observation of fa is the presence of chaotic motion of the particle in the static boundaries version of such a billiard ( existence of positive lyapunov exponents on a nontrivial region of phase space ) @xcite .",
    "this conjecture , known as lra conjecture , was confirmed in different billiards @xcite .",
    "recently it has been reported fa in an harmonically driven version of the integrable static elliptical billiard @xcite .",
    "the invariant manifolds observed for the static version become penetrable in the driven model , generating a laminar dynamics .",
    "moreover , the driving replaces the separatrix by a chaotic layer where the motion is stochastic , introducing a diffusion process to the velocity and leading the particle to present fa .",
    "after that , the lra conjecture was amended @xcite , where the existence of a chaotic component was replaced by the existence of a heteroclinic orbit in phase space .",
    "recently , it has been studied the aspects of a nonstandard exponential energy growth @xcite .",
    "this phenomena was numerically observed in a slitted rectangular billiard with a bar oscillating smoothly , where it was demonstrated that the origin of the exponential fa is due to the transition of the particle between the invariant spanning curves observed in phase space of the fum @xcite .",
    "also , the aspects of a robust exponential fa were obtained analytically and numerically in a class of systems that consists of billiards where a particle collides against time dependent boundaries that are deformed , separated and then reconnected @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been mathematically demonstrated the existence of orbits with energy growth rate ranging from power law to exponential fa in non - autonomous billiards @xcite .",
    "other important observation on the state of the art of the problem is that fa has demonstrated to be not a robust phenomena under the presence of inelastic collisions @xcite and under viscous drag force @xcite .",
    "however few studies are known about consequences of friction due to the slip of a body on a surface on fa process .",
    "when friction acts on a particle in a fum where a wall moves according to saw - tooth function , fa can either persist or not depending on initial conditions and parameters @xcite .    before we start to talk about this work , it is interesting to say that the study of the billiards class is of interest specially because the versatility of practical description to a wide variety of systems , such as waveguide and rippled channel @xcite , magnetic field lines in toroidal plasma devices @xcite , cold atoms @xcite , channel flows @xcite , escape processes @xcite and transport properties @xcite .    in this work",
    "we study a modified version of fermi - ulam model where a charged particle moves under dissipation due to friction and it is accelerated by an electric field between metallic walls . we are seeking to understand and describe some dynamical properties of the system either as function of the time as well as according to the control parameters .",
    "we regard that the oscillating wall moves smoothly and we study both the simplified and complete models . under specific situations the model under study",
    "is a prototype for fa and in the scenario of null electric field the model corresponds to a fum with friction .",
    "depending on parameters , the simplified model presents a coexistence of attractors with trajectories that present fa .",
    "moreover , in the complete model we observe numerically the coexistence of kam islands with trajectories that evolve to null velocity , even for null electric field .",
    "the paper is organized as follow . in the next section we present the model and we discuss the results of both simplified and complete versions . in section [ conclusions ] we provide the conclusions and final remarks .",
    "it is well known that charged particles are accelerated by electric fields . in this paper",
    "we propose a modification of the fum where the walls are assumed to be metallic and sufficiently large and massive .",
    "they are charged with opposite charges generating an electric field @xmath0 that acts on a charged particle between them .",
    "for instance , let us say that @xmath0 is in the direction @xmath1 , @xmath2 . at each collision with the left wall the particle acquires charge @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and an electric force @xmath5 acts on the particle forcing it to move to the right .",
    "similarly , the particle acquires charge @xmath6 when it collides against the right wall and it becomes under action of an electric force @xmath7 .",
    "the left wall oscillates smoothly with amplitude @xmath8 and frequency @xmath9 according to the expression @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is time and @xmath12 is an initial phase .",
    "the right wall is fixed at position @xmath13 .",
    "we regard the situation where collisions are elastic , so the absolute value of the velocity of the particle relative to the walls is not affected by collisions .    additionally , we consider that the particle moves under action of a friction force @xmath14 , due to the friction of it on a rough surface . the quantity @xmath15 corresponds to the kinetic coefficient friction and @xmath16 is the magnitude of a normal force . because @xmath17 opposites the motion ( velocity ) of the particle , @xmath18 when the particle moves to the left ( velocity @xmath19 ) and vice - versa .",
    "it is also important to define @xmath20 as the static friction coefficient .",
    "so @xmath21 is the maximum absolute value of the static friction force that acts on the particle when it is stopped .",
    "the signal of @xmath22 depends on tendency of motion .",
    "so if the particle stops after colliding the right wall , then @xmath23 .",
    "similar situation occurs when the particle stops after colliding the moving wall .",
    "therefore , when the particle is moving between the walls , it is under action of a force @xmath24 .",
    "when the particle stops it is under a force @xmath25 .",
    "so , depending on signal and strength of electric and friction forces the particle can gain or loose energy while it moves between two collisions . in terms of electric , static and dynamical friction forces",
    "we define the following set of parameters : @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the mass of the particle . moreover , it is appropriate to define the following set of dimensionless variables : @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "we define the dimensionless amplitude of oscillation by the expression @xmath34 .    from the above definitions , we have that the parameter @xmath35 represents the competition between the electric and dynamic friction forces .",
    "if @xmath36 , then the electric force is greater than the dynamical friction force ( and vice - versa ) .",
    "similarly , the parameter @xmath37 represents the competition between the electric and static friction forces .",
    "therefore if the particle reaches the rest and @xmath38 , then the maximum static friction force is greater than the electric force .",
    "if this situation occurs in the region where the moving wall oscillates , then the particle remains in rest and waiting a collision with the moving wall .",
    "however if the particle stops somewhere outside the region of oscillation of the moving wall , then its dynamics is over .",
    "if @xmath39 , then the particle : ( i ) does not stop after colliding the fixed wall or ; ( ii ) it stops instantaneously if its velocity is negative after a collision with the moving wall .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the situations where @xmath40 and @xmath38 can be interpreted as null electric force , @xmath41 , and the model corresponds to a fum with dissipation due to friction .",
    "the non null electric field is important to produce non - negative values of @xmath35 and @xmath37 .",
    "let us discuss initially the dynamics of the particle regarding a simplification of the model and , after that , we present the results of the complete model .      in the simplified version of the model the oscillating wall imparts momentum to the particle",
    "however , it is assumed that it takes a stationary position .",
    "so the time interval spent by the particle in the travel between collisions does not depend on the phase of the oscillating wall .",
    "the simplified versions are widely studied because they are useful under some aspects .",
    "for example , they allow to obtain analytical results that can be extended to the complete versions and , usually , they speed up greatly the simulations when compared to the corresponding complete versions .",
    "if at an instant @xmath42 the particle hits the moving wall and acquires velocity @xmath43 , then the dynamics of the system after subsequent collisions is obtained by the following two - dimensional map @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the phase of the wall at instant @xmath42 , and @xmath46\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the interval of time between two collisions with the wall .",
    "the absolute value bars are required to avoid the particle to leave the region between the walls .",
    "if the inequality @xmath47 is satisfied , then the particle stops between the walls and the the simulation for this trajectory is terminated .",
    "let us now proceed with the investigation of the fixed points and their stability , which will be important latter on along the paper .",
    "the fixed points are obtained from map ( [ simplifiedmap ] ) by applying the conditions @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "so we obtain the coordinates @xmath50 of the fixed points in phase space as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a non null positive integer . for each value of @xmath52 and @xmath53 the above expression furnishes , in the interval @xmath54 , a pair of fixed points with the same velocity and different values of phase .",
    "let us nominate @xmath55 and @xmath56 the two possible values of @xmath57 associated to each value of @xmath58 given by eq .",
    "( [ fixedpoints ] ) . if the absolute value of @xmath35 increases , or @xmath53 decreases , then the maximum value of @xmath52 decreases and , therefore , it decreases the maximum number of fixed points .",
    "so , for @xmath59 the phase space does not present any fixed point .    to classify the fixed points according to their stability ,",
    "we must obtain the eigenvalues of the jacobian matrix @xmath60 where @xmath61 the eigenvalues @xmath62 are obtained from equation @xmath63 .",
    "the procedure furnishes , for each fixed point , a pair of eigenvalues @xmath64 , where @xmath65 and @xmath66    we evaluated the eigenvalues of @xmath67 regarding the fixed points given by eq .",

    ". figure [ eigenvaluesphi1 ] illustrates the eigenvalues for the fixed points @xmath69 .",
    "the smaller the @xmath70 the greater the number of fixed points . to simplify the visualization",
    "we include the eigenvalues of fixed points with @xmath71 . but decreasing the absolute value of @xmath35 we observe similar curves for other values of @xmath52 .",
    "both @xmath72 and @xmath73 are real quantities , and because @xmath74 and @xmath75 , the fixed points @xmath69 are classified as saddle .",
    "and @xmath73 associated to the fixed points @xmath76.,width=283,height=151 ]    the fixed points @xmath77 have complex eigenvalues .",

    "[ eigenvaluesphi1 ] and [ eigenvaluesphi2 ] and the above discussion we conclude that the phase space presents saddle - node bifurcations at @xmath85 .",
    "the bullets in such figures indicate the values of @xmath35 where some of these bifurcations occur .",
    "let us now discuss the dynamical aspects of trajectories in phase space and how these trajectories are organized in terms of the manifolds of the fixed points of the system under study .",

    "the construction of the stable manifolds is slightly more complicated because it requires the construction of the inverse of the map , which furnishes the values of velocity , @xmath43 , and phase of the wall @xmath88 from the next collision , when velocity and phase are @xmath89 and @xmath90 , @xmath91~~{\\rm~mod}~2\\pi \\end{array } \\right.,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath92 is given by eq .",

    "some people can say that dissipation is associated to friction , which results in energy dissipation and corresponds to non - modelled degrees of freedom .",
    "other people can say that dissipation corresponds to the situations where the volume of phase space is not preserved or , in other words , the system is not described by the hamilton s equations .    the recurrence theorem , which is a consequence of liouville s theorem , states that , in a hamiltonian system where the phase space is bounded , exists a finite neighbourhood of a point in phase space where trajectories emanates from and eventually return to this neighbourhood .    in context of the results reported here , for the situations where the particle reaches the rest between the walls , the time until the next collision diverges",
    "therefore , in contrast to the hypothesis of the recurrence theorem , the phase space of the system is not a bounded domain .",
    "the velocity axis is also unbounded in vertical .",
    "the important point is that the theory protects itself from an apparent paradox @xcite ; our results do not violate the recurrence theorem .    a similar coexistence of trajectories that present fa with kam islands ( figs .",
    "[ a>0complete]a , b ) ) is observed for certain values of parameter in the non - dissipative fermi - pustylnikov model @xcite .",
    "regions of regular dynamics were also reported in a simplified fum with a drag force proportional to the velocity of the particle @xcite .    as discussed before ,",
    "the situations @xmath40 and @xmath38 can be interpreted as null electric force ( @xmath41 ) . in this case",
    "the parameters are given by @xmath169 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "therefore , the discussed coexistence of islands of regular motion and an attractor occurs in a fum where a particle moves under friction in absence of electric field .",
    "it is an interesting observation because it makes us to believe that such a coexistence occurs in other systems as , for example , in time dependent two - dimensional billiards .",
    "the main result we report here is the coexistence of an attractor located at @xmath164 with islands of regular motion .      as presented in previous sections , for @xmath40 both simplified and complete models present trajectories that evolve to the low energy portion of the phase space .",

    "the energy of the particle is affected by three accelerating mechanisms : i ) the electric field , that most of time furnishes energy to the particle , ii ) the dissipation on the surface , that drains the energy of the particle , and iii ) the oscillating wall , that furnishes or absorbs energy from the particle depending on the phase .",
    "the friction force acts in the trajectory of the particle continuously .",
    "the same rule applies for the electric force .",
    "the motion of the wall affects the energy of the particle at discrete time instants , when the collisions occur .",
    "there are regions in phase space where the energy lost or received during the travel between the walls comes into a dynamical equilibrium with the amount of energy provided at the collisions instants with the oscillating wall in a such a way that islands of regular motion are formed in the complete model . in other words , there is a compensation between losing and gaining energy .",
    "these islands are observed also for null electric field , where the energy dissipated by the friction is balanced by the contribution of the oscillating wall .",
    "the simplified model furnishes a good approximation to the location of the fixed points , given by eq .",
    "( [ fixedpoints ] ) .",
    "the dependence on parameter @xmath35 in @xmath58 and @xmath57 expressions corresponds to the correction due to the contributions of the electric and friction forces . for @xmath188 the expression ( [ fixedpoints ] ) furnishes the location of the fixed points in fum .    regarding the results of the simplified map ( [ simplifiedmap ] ) , we observe in fig .",
    "[ eigenvaluesphi2 ] that elliptic islands are observed for @xmath188 , when @xmath189 . taking the limit @xmath190 in the map of simplified model",
    "we recover the situation where the particle moves inertially between elastic collisions with the boundaries and we obtain the map of fum , as it is expected .",
    "the simplified fum retains the nonlinearity and several characteristics of the complete fum , such as the mixed structure of phase space , where kam islands coexist with chaotic portions and invariant spanning curves prevent trajectories of acquiring unlimited energy growth .",
    "the simplified version we study here preserves the occurrence of trajectories that present fa , for @xmath36 , or trajectories that evolve to @xmath164 , for @xmath40 .",
    "however , although we regard small values of @xmath53 , when compared to the distance between the walls , the simplified model does not preserve the islands of regular motion observed in phase space of the complete model . disregarding the small displacement of the particle inside the collision zone , defined by the interval",
    "@xmath191 $ ] , affects the qualitative behavior of the trajectories near the fixed points .",
    "the stability of the islands of the complete model , fig [ a>0complete ] , was confirmed numerically for initial conditions iterated up to @xmath192 iterations . because islands of regular motion are observed in this dissipative system even for null electric field ,",
    "it is quite possible to one to find such structures in the phase space of two - dimensional time dependent billiards , when the particle slips on a rough surface .",
    "we studied a version of fermi - ulam model where a metallic particle interacts with charged walls and with the field generated between them .",
    "moreover , we regarded that the particle moves under action of a friction force due to its slip on a rough surface . the parameter @xmath53 defines the strength of nonlinearity and the parameters @xmath35 , @xmath193 and @xmath37 represent combinations of the electric and friction forces .",
    "we studied the dynamics of the particle regarding a simplified and the complete versions of the model , which present phase spaces with different structures .",
    "the phase space of the simplified version presents spiral repelling fixed points and trajectories that evolve to @xmath164 , for @xmath40 . in the other hand ,",
    "the phase space presents a coexistence of trajectories that evolve asymptotically to attractor fixed points and trajectories that present fermi acceleration for @xmath36 .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of the trajectories is described in terms of the location of initial points with relation to the channels formed by the stable manifolds of the saddle points .",
    "the phase space of complete model presents kam islands coexisting with trajectories that i ) present fa , when @xmath36 , or ii ) evolve to @xmath164 , when @xmath40 .",
    "we discuss that the coexistence of conservative and dissipative behaviours observed for @xmath40 does not violate the recurrence theorem , because the phase space is not a bounded domain .",
    "moreover , we discuss that such behaviour occurs even for null electric force and , therefore , this result gives a hint of observation of this coexistence in other dynamical systems where the particle moves under action of the friction force , including the class of time dependent two - dimensional billiards .",
    "however , numerical confirmation is needed .",
    "finally , we obtained an analytical approximation to the velocity by evaluating a taylor expansion until 5th order in @xmath177 regarding the map of the simplified model .",
