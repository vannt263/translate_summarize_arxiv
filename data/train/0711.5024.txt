    "the derivation of nuclear forces from chiral effective field theory ( eft ) has been discussed extensively in the literature since the work of weinberg @xcite .",
    "an underlying power counting allows to improve calculations systematically by going to higher orders in a perturbative expansion .",
    "in addition , it is possible to derive two- and corresponding three - nucleon forces as well as external current operators in a consistent way . for reviews we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "recently the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath2 ) interaction was described to a high precision in chiral eft @xcite . as of today , the strangeness @xmath3 hyperon - nucleon ( @xmath4 ) interaction ( @xmath5 ) was not investigated extensively using eft @xcite .",
    "the strangeness @xmath6 hyperon - hyperon ( @xmath7 ) and cascade - nucleon ( @xmath8 ) interactions had not been investigated using chiral eft so far . in this contribution",
    "we show selected results for the recently constructed chiral eft for the @xmath0 baryon - baryon ( @xmath9 ) channels @xcite . at leading order ( lo ) in the power counting ,",
    "the @xmath4 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 potentials consist of four - baryon contact terms without derivatives and of one - pseudoscalar - meson exchanges , analogous to the @xmath2 potential of @xcite .",
    "the potentials are derived using su(3 ) constraints .",
    "we solve a coupled channels lippmann - schwinger ( ls ) equation for the lo potential and fit to the low - energy @xmath4 scattering data .",
    "we have constructed the chiral potentials for the @xmath0 sectors at lo using the weinberg power counting , see @xcite .",
    "the lo potential consists of four - baryon contact terms without derivatives and of one - pseudoscalar - meson exchanges .",
    "the lo @xmath1 invariant contact terms for the octet baryon - baryon interactions that are hermitian and invariant under lorentz transformations were discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the pertinent lagrangians read @xmath10 as discussed in @xcite , in lo the lagrangians give rise to six independent low - energy coefficients ( lecs ) : @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 refer to the central and spin - spin parts of the potential respectively .",
    "the contribution of one - pseudoscalar - meson exchanges is discussed extensively in the literature .",
    "we do not discuss it here , instead we refer the reader to e.g. @xcite .",
    "we solve the ls equation for the @xmath4 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 systems .",
    "the potentials in the ls equation are cut off with a regulator function , @xmath19 $ ] , in order to remove high - energy components of the baryon and pseudoscalar meson fields .",
    "because of @xmath1 symmetry , only five of the lecs can be determined in a fit to the @xmath4 scattering data .",
    "a good description of the 35 low - energy @xmath4 scattering data has been obtained for cut - off values @xmath20 mev and for natural values of the lecs .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "see @xcite for more details .",
    "the @xmath4 interaction based on chiral eft yields a correctly bound hypertriton , also reasonable @xmath21 separation energies for @xmath22 have been predicted @xcite .",
    "the sixth lec is only present in the isospin zero @xmath6 channels .",
    "there is scarce experimental knowledge in these channels . in the @xmath23 system , we assume a moderate attraction and exclude bound states or near - threshold resonances . based on these considerations the sixth lec was varied in the range of @xmath24 times the natural value .",
    "various cross sections for @xmath25 mev are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "see @xcite for more details .",
    "our findings have shown that the chiral eft scheme , successfully applied in @xcite to the @xmath2 interaction , also works well for the @xmath0 @xmath9 interactions in lo .",
    "it will be interesting to perform a combined @xmath2 and @xmath4 study in chiral eft , starting with a next - to - leading order ( nlo ) calculation .",
    "work in this direction is in progress .",
