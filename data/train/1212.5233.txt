    "for example , a three vertex can be written as @xmath15 .",
    "the order of addition is important , since it corresponds to micro - causal structure of interactions@xcite .",
    "the torsion of momentum space is a measure of the non - commutativity and the curvature is a measure of non - associativity of addition rule of momenta.@xcite    dynamics of point particles is defined by the action : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is an affine ( time ) parameter along the trajectory of the particle and an interaction labeled by @xmath18 happens at @xmath19 for each particle ; @xmath20 are _ hamiltonian spacetime coordinates _ which are defined as being canonically conjugate to @xmath21 : @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the mass shell condition @xmath24 is imposed by the lagrange multiplier @xmath25 .",
    "the interaction part of the action is a lagrange multiplier times the conservation of momenta @xmath26 . by varying the action",
    ", we get the equations of motion , the two of which we will be concerned with : @xmath27 @xmath28 indicates an incoming / outgoing particle respectively .",
    "equation ( [ four velocity ] ) tells us how free particles propagate on one cotangent space (  hamiltonian spacetime \" @xmath29 ) of their phase space ; and equation ( [ end points ] ) describes how cotangent spaces @xmath29 of different particles are connected by interaction events @xmath30 .",
    "physics should be invariant under momentum space diffeomorphisms , i.e. redefinition of coordinates on the momentum manifold .",
    "such a transformation is given by : @xmath31 s.t .",
    "the geodesic distance between the origin and @xmath9 is preserved . under this transformation , @xmath32",
    ", @xmath33 transforms like a covector : @xmath34 . by applying these transformations to our action",
    "we see that it is unaltered , as desired .",
    "in relativity the causal relationships between events are expressed as geometrical relationships between points on the spacetime manifold , while in rl we do not have a universal spacetime .",
    "we thus have to come back to the most fundamental notion of causality between events .",
    "define event b to be in the _ causal past _ of event a if in the process that is being considered , there exists a sequence of events @xmath35 s.t . from each event there",
    "exists an outgoing free - propagating particle coming to the next event . we write it as @xmath36 .",
    "vice versa we can define _ causal future _ @xmath37 .",
    "the above definition of causal relationship is actually a strict partial order . in analogy with the notion in general relativity , one type of causality violation is if @xmath38 events @xmath39 s.t.@xmath40 i.e. causal loop .",
    "let us check the existence of the simplest causal loop .",
    "assume two bi - particle collision events @xmath41 and @xmath42 , defined by conservation laws @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "particle 0 with momentum @xmath45 is created from event @xmath41 and then collides with another particle at event @xmath42 .",
    "the twist is now to consider particle 1 with momentum @xmath46 created at event @xmath47 and then colliding with another particle at event @xmath41 , which creates the particle 0 .",
    "we use @xmath48 and @xmath49 to label the starting point and ending point of particle @xmath45 s worldline which lives on @xmath50 ; and similarly @xmath51 and @xmath52 for particle @xmath46 , as in fig[[phasespace ] ] .",
    "particle 0 freely proporgates from event a to b for proper time @xmath53 on @xmath54 ; the end of its worldline is related with the starting point of particle 1 s worldline by interaction b : @xmath55 similarly , the other part of the loop is described by @xmath56 where @xmath57 are given by equation of motion ( [ four velocity ] ) .",
    "thus the existence of a causal loop process is equivalent to the following equation having a physical solution for @xmath58 and proper times @xmath59 : @xmath60 where the matrix @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "+ the above is a general condition .",
    "once we specify the geometry of momentum space and write down the conservation laws of two vertices , the above condition ( [ general condition ] ) will then give a system of four linear equations with six free unknowns : @xmath58 , @xmath53 and @xmath63 .",
    "based on the cramer s rule , if the matrix @xmath64 has rank four , i.e. the determinant is non - zero , any physical choice of @xmath53 and @xmath63 yields a unique solution for @xmath58 .",
    "if the matrix @xmath65 has rank less than four , we can fix a ratio @xmath66 first and then check the number of remaining unknowns of the system of the homogeneous equations . assuming the number of unknowns is @xmath67 ( @xmath68 now ) , if @xmath69 s.t .",
    "the new matrix of coefficients of the system of equations has rank @xmath70 , then we can always get at least one physical solution for @xmath71 . when for @xmath72 the new coefficients matrix has a rank @xmath73 , only then the equation does not have physical solutions , which means the causal loop ( corresponding to these specific interaction vertices ) does not occur",
    ".    the solution will be invariant under the momentum space diffeomorphsim , because the equation ( [ general condition ] ) is just based on the equations of motion , which are invariant .    in the special relativity limit of rl , beacuse of the linearity of momentum space , which also implies trivial isomorphism between cotangent spaces , the transport operators @xmath74",
    ", @xmath75 are all identity matrices .",
    "this makes the above equation ( [ general condition ] ) immediately degenerate to @xmath76 , which does nt have physical solution .",
    "it means that this kind of causal loop will not occur in special relativity .",
    "the causal loop formed by two interaction events is just the simplest case .",
    "similar processes can be constructed by other forms of vertices and more events : @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , which conditions enjoy the similar form with the simplest case : @xmath80 these compose a system of four linear equations with @xmath81 unknowns , where @xmath82 is the number of interactions that form the causal loop .",
    "compared with eq .",
    "( [ general condition ] ) , the above conditions are even easier to be satisfied , since there are more unknowns in the same number of equations .",
    "more general causal loops that contain branching out can be always decomposed into a few simple loops described by the above process .",
    "in this section we will illustrate the existence of causal loops in a specific geometry of momentum space .",
    "@xmath83-poincar hopf algebra , a dimensionful deformation of the poincar group , describes a momentum space with de sitter metric , torsion and nonmetricity , which is the first well - studied example of the non - trivial geometry of momentum space in relative locality @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is also one of the weakest deformation of poincar group as a hopf algebra@xcite .",
    "the line element of the @xmath84poincar momentum space in comoving coordinates is given by : @xmath85 where @xmath83 is a large energy scale close to planck energy .",
    "the mass - shell condition is given by the geodesic distance from point @xmath9 to the origin of momentum space@xcite : @xmath86 from which we can get e.o.m.([four velocity ] ) .",
    "the addition rule of momenta on @xmath84poincar momentum space is as follows@xcite : @xmath87    as an example of the simplest causal loop , we look at two events @xmath88 , which non - linear conservation of momenta are @xmath89 , see fig .",
    "[ loop ] .",
    "the conservation of momenta can be writen out explicitly as ( [ addition rule ] ) .",
    "@xmath90    now , we have all the necessary elements to calculate the condition ( [ general condition ] ) for this specific example .",
    "it turns out that the matrix @xmath64 has rank three and an unknown @xmath91 drops out , which is due to the linear addition rule of the zero component of momenta , in ( [ addition rule ] ) . for simplicity ,",
    "assume that the particles with momentum @xmath92 have same rest mass @xmath93 .",
    "using @xmath53 to rescale the other unknowns and solve the above equation for @xmath94 and @xmath95 , we get the solution , in which the ratio of two proper times is @xmath96\\!\\!+\\!2f \\kappa^2 \\sinh ( \\frac{p^0_0}{\\kappa})}{p^1_i e^{\\frac{p^1_0}{\\kappa}}\\ ! \\left[2 e^{\\frac{k_0+r_0}{\\kappa } } ( k_i\\!-\\!r_i ) -\\!f p^1_i\\right]\\!\\!-\\!2f \\kappa^2 \\sinh ( \\frac{p^1_0}{\\kappa } ) } \\label{solution } \\vspace{-1 mm}\\ ] ] where @xmath97 just for shorthand . thus as long as there exists physical values of momenta such that the solution for @xmath98 is finite and @xmath94 is positive",
    ", this specific causal loop can occur .",
    "we check it as follows .    for simplicity and without lose of generality",
    ", we set the last two spatial components for all the momenta to be zero . because the energy of single particle has to be smaller than @xmath83 , energies @xmath99 .",
    "the requirement of timelike on - shell momenta @xmath100 constrains the spatial components , @xmath101 we can then plot the region in terms of @xmath102 that allow the equation to have physical solution for @xmath103 and @xmath104 under a specific relationship among other momenta .",
    "see fig.[region ]    surprisingly , for any low energy scale of momenta choice ( as long as @xmath83 is not infinity ) , there always exist solutions for positive @xmath105s and finite @xmath48 . at low energy ,",
    "the solution of @xmath106 in eq .",
    "( [ general condition ] ) is proportional to @xmath107 :    @xmath108 m } \\vspace{-0.5 mm}\\ ] ] thus when the scale @xmath83 is much larger than the scale of momenta , @xmath48 has quite large scale compared with @xmath53 . at high energy ,",
    "the scales of solutions are reasonable .",
    "two random examples taken from two different energy scales are shown in table ( [ tab ] ) .",
    "if the current form of relative locality were to be correct , then we would expect causal loops to be common at high energy .",
    ".comparison of the results at different energy scales [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab ]",
    "we have shown that relative locality allows causal loops solutions , and it is surprisingly simple to construct them .",
    "this is a generic feature arising from the phase space structure of rl : there is no universal spacetime , and the configuration information lives on the different cotangent spaces of the momentum manifold .",
    "the non - linear conservations of momenta at interaction events determine how the cotangent spaces @xmath29 of different particles are connected by the interaction , eq.([end points ] ) . due to the nontrivial relations between cotangent spaces ,",
    "a particle can come back to the event that causes its own creation as one of the incoming participants of that interaction .    in the last section , the causal loop s existence depends on specific choices of points on the cotangent space @xmath29 (",
    "let us call itx dependence \" ) . in general , after fixing the proper times , the solution set of @xmath109 ( if it exists ) is a lower dimensional subspace . in the example we calculated",
    ", it was a line on @xmath54 .",
    "the same unusual feature of  x dependence \" is also present in many of the usual loop processes without causal issues in relative locality , e.g.@xcite .",
    "some nets of vertices lead to the dependence on `` where '' the events are on the cotangent space , while some do not .",
    "we do not yet have fundamental reasons for choosing some forms of vertices rather than others just for the sake of  x independence \" .",
    "this necessitates future work in understanding the physical meaning of the hamiltonian spacetimes and the choices of vertices",
    ".    in @xcite authors enforced the translation invariance on @xmath29 , which is a more strict symmetry than  x independence \" .",
    "however , the approach there requires the use of very non - local interaction vertices to achieve the symmetry , which is not physical .",
    "future work should address the following questions .",
    "is  x dependence \" of many loops a generic feature ?",
    "should translation invariance on @xmath29 be a fundamental symmetry of relative locality ?",
    "how do we achieve  x independence \" or translation invariance on @xmath29 in a physical way ? can we remove the causal loops by enforcing those symmetries in the theory ?    does the existence of causal loops imply that there is an inconsistency in the theory ?",
    "in general relativity , einstein equations have closed - timelike - curve ( ctc ) solutions .",
    "one way out of the grandfather paradox is the novikov self - consistency principle , which states that events in ctc influence each other in a self - adjusted , cyclical way and the only solutions can occur locally are those which are globally self - consistent @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown that at the quantum level , unitarity fails for interacting fields in ctc and the subjective probabilities of events can be different for different observers @xcite .",
    "it probably points towards that spacetimes with ctc are unphysical . in relative locality",
    ", a well - defined quantum theory has not been built yet , but there is ongoing research into constructing it .",
    "the lesson from quantum field theory in curved spacetime shows that it would be non - trivial to have causal loops in a consistent unitary theory .",
    "it is thus essential to study whether it is even possible to construct a unitary quantum field theory for relative locality .",
    "if the current form of relative locality were to be experimentally established in the future , we need to rethink causality as a fundamental property of nature .",
    "it would influence some approaches to quantum gravity which take discrete causal structure as basic assumption .",
    "another possibility is that relative locality is an incomplete or a wrong theory in its current form , and the revision of it should exclude causal loops .",
