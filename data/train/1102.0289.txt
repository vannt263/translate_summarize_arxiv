    "in this paper , i have considered the astrophysical case of spherical accretion to check the consistency and to constrain the physical interpretation of mond .",
    "the background is outlined in section  [ sec : bkg ] , and the outcome in mond regime for different modifications are described in section ",
    "[ sec : mda ] . section ",
    "[ sec : dis ] contains discussions on the results , and i present conclusions in section ",
    "[ sec : con ] .",
    "in mond , the newtonian equation of dynamics @xmath2 is modified to @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a dimensionless parameter .",
    "this modification is significant at very low acceleration regime ( below an acceleration of @xmath5 m  s@xmath6 ) .",
    "it is proposed that @xmath7 for @xmath8 and @xmath9 for @xmath10 , and the exact form of @xmath11 may not have any serious consequences .",
    "thus the motion due to gravitational force will be governed by @xmath12 for the low acceleration at a large distance from the centre of a galaxy , this will imply @xmath13 giving rise to a flat rotation curve .",
    "see @xcite for a comprehensive critical review of the theory , a more generalized formulation and its implications , its observational supports and other details . also see @xcite and references therein for the details of the `` mond inspired '' relativistic , generalized theory of gravitation called teves . for the purpose of this work",
    ", i will only use this theory to be phenomenological as summarized in equation ( [ eqn : mond ] ) to investigate its possible implications in the case of spherically symmetrical hydrodynamic accretion .",
    "note that in equation ( [ eqn : mond ] ) , @xmath14 can be written as a modification of either the inertial term ( @xmath15 ) or modification of the gravitation force term ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "though they lead to the same result for the rotation curve , the physical implication is significantly different .",
    "there may be situations where these two interpretations leads to drastically different results .",
    "note that this phenomenological description of the dynamics is consistent with the nonrelativistic limit of teves with spherical symmetry @xcite .",
    "here i have considered spherical accretion to check if , in the mond regime , there is any change of physical conditions from that of the newtonian scenario . in the newtonian case ,",
    "the governing equations for spherically symmetrical hydrodynamic steady state accretion are the continuity equation and the euler s equation @xmath17 @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the radial inward velocity , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are pressure and density related by an equation of state @xmath22 and polytropic index @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the mass of accretor .",
    "the sound speed in the medium @xmath25 is related to @xmath26 and @xmath27 as @xmath28 .    starting with a boundary condition",
    "@xmath29 and @xmath30 at a very large distance from the central accretor , equations ( [ ncont ] ) and ( [ neuler ] ) can be solved for a given @xmath24 and @xmath23 to derive the steady state density and velocity profile .",
    "the solution of astrophysical interest is an unique transonic solution with a mass accretion rate of @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a dimensionless constant .",
    "note that the acceleration at the sonic point is of the order of @xmath33 . for a solar mass accretor and a typical ambient sound speed of @xmath34 km  s@xmath6 ,",
    "this is @xmath35 , very much comparable to the mond acceleration constant @xmath36 . keeping this in mind ,",
    "it is useful here to introduce a dimensionless parameter @xmath37 and to study the behaviour of the system for different values of this parameter .    in case of the hydrodynamic accretion , the dynamics",
    "is governed by the interplay of three terms - pressure , gravitational force and inertia . in the aforementioned two different interpretations of the mond modification , viz .",
    "modification of gravitational force and modification of the newtonian dynamics , these three terms change in different ways .",
    "thus , considering this case of hydrodynamic accretion gives us a chance to study any possible difference that may arise in these two interpretations .      in this case",
    ", we consider the modification of the gravitational force of the form @xmath38 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , this can be derived from teves at nonrelativistic limit assuming spherical symmetry @xcite . with this modification",
    ", the continuity equation will remain unchanged from equation ( [ ncont ] ) , but the euler s equation will be modified to @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 . note that , in mond regime , with @xmath42 , the gravitational term will be @xmath43 , whereas in the low acceleration regime with @xmath44 , it will be same as the regular newtonian term @xmath45 . using equation ( [ ncont ] ) and the equation of state , @xmath26 and @xmath27",
    "can be eliminated from equation ( [ m1euler ] ) in terms of @xmath46 , and can be re - written as @xmath47 with an initial condition @xmath48 and @xmath49 at a small radius @xmath50 , equation ( [ dudr1 ] ) , along with the equation of state and the continuity equation , can be solved numerically for the density and velocity profile .",
    "note that for typical astrophysical condition , @xmath51 at small radius is significantly larger than @xmath36 .",
    "so , for the inner region , the mondian solution will not differ from the newtonian solution . here also , like the newtonian case , velocity at @xmath50 should have a unique value for the solution to pass through the sonic point and to give the right accretion rate . for a given @xmath23 and @xmath52 , equation ( [ dudr1 ] )",
    "can be solved with same initial conditions for both the newtonian and the mondian case . for the newtonian case ,",
    "at large radius , @xmath27 and @xmath53 tends asymptotically to a constant value @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively , and the velocity @xmath54 tends to zero .",
    "interestingly , as shown in figure ( [ fig : mond-1 ] ) , for mondian case , equation ( [ dudr1 ] ) does not have this asymptotic solution at large radius .",
    "figure ( [ fig : mond-1 ] ) shows the newtonian and mondian solutions for @xmath55 and @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the top and bottom panels show the density and the velocity field respectively .",
    "both the density and the velocity profile deviate from the newtonian solution and diverges away from the asymptotic solution at large radius . in these plots ,",
    "the density and the velocity values are scaled by @xmath59 and @xmath30 ( of the newtonian solution ) , and the radius is scaled by @xmath60 .",
    "one can understand this result analytically with the following arguments . in the mond regime with @xmath61 , equation ( [ dudr1 ] )",
    "can be written in terms of @xmath62 as @xmath63 since both the term in numerator scales as @xmath64 , with decreasing @xmath53 , @xmath65 changes sign at large radius .",
    "thus , @xmath66 is no more a monotonically decreasing function with increasing radius , and the mondian solution diverges from the newtonian solution .",
    "it implies that there is no solution of the flow with @xmath27 , @xmath46 and @xmath53 having the right physical boundary condition .     density and velocity profile in the mond regime for the modified gravitational force case . here",

    "one of the roots is imaginary at large radius but the other one satisfies physical boundary condition requirement.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in this case also , the continuity equation will remain as in equation ( [ ncont ] ) .",
    "but since @xmath69 , the modified euler s equation will be @xmath70 following a similar numerical analysis as in the earlier case , one can solve for @xmath19 and @xmath21 from equations ( [ ncont ] ) and ( [ m2euler ] ) .",
    "as shown in figure ( [ fig : mond-2 ] ) , one of the solutions in this case starts to deviate from that of the newtonian one at a large radius , and have asymptotic value of @xmath59 and @xmath30 lower than that of the newtonian value with same mass accretion rate .",
    "the other solution becomes imaginary after a certain distance .",
    "figure ( [ fig : mond-2 ] ) shows the newtonian and these two mondian solution for @xmath55 and @xmath68 .",
    "the deviation of @xmath59 from that of the newtonian one depends on the value of both @xmath23 and @xmath52 .    eliminating @xmath26 and @xmath27 using equation ( [ ncont ] ) and the equation of state , equation ( [ m2euler ] )",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath71 in the mond regime , where @xmath72 , this also becomes a quadratic equation in @xmath65 @xmath73 where the condition of a real solution for @xmath65 is @xmath74 this is an upper limit condition to @xmath46 and does not contradict the required physical condition of velocity tending to zero at large radius .",
    "thus , in this case , there exist a physically meaningful solution where @xmath46 tends to zero at large radius whereas density and sound speed asymptotically tend to @xmath59 and @xmath30 respectively .",

    "as shown in figure ( [ fig : mond-3 ] ) , the steady state mass accretion rate may change by up to @xmath0 . however , in case of astrophysical accretion , the accretor mass , ambient density and sound speed are often not so well determined to observationally distinguish this change between newtonian and mondian accretion .",
