    "neutron scattering has shown an anomalous change in the phonon spectrum at the superconducting transition , indicating an interesting role for phonons in the cuprates @xcite .",
    "estimates of the magnitude of the electron - phonon coupling , and the energy of the phonon mode put the problem outside the limited region of applicability for bcs theory , so schemes to cope with a wider range of parameters need to be developed .",
    "moreover , since there a node in the superconducting gap consistent with d - wave symmetry @xcite , any theory implicating phonons as the mechanism must be able to explain the unconventional order .",
    "electron - phonon ( e - ph ) interactions can be described by the following generic model , @xmath3 here , @xmath4 and @xmath5 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( representing a quasi-2d system and taming the van - hove singularities ) .",
    "the holstein model is a special case where @xmath8 and @xmath9 , for which @xmath10 is the dimensionless e - ph coupling ( @xmath11 is the half - band width ) .",
    "the momentum - independent phonon dispersion approximates an optical phonon , and the momentum - independent e - ph coupling corresponds to a completely local interaction",
    ". a coulomb pseudo - potential , @xmath12 , may be added ( i.e. hubbard model at the hartree  fock level ) .",

    "dca enables computations in the thermodynamic limit , via an equivalent cluster impurity problem.,scaledwidth=46.0% ]         some treatments of the arpes kink used a standard eliashberg theory with anisotropic coupling and an assumed @xmath0-wave order parameter for fitting purposes @xcite .",
    "the extended eliashberg approach that i have developed differs significantly from previous work in the sense that it is fully self - consistent , with no prior assumptions about the form of the order parameter ( i.e. any @xmath0-wave order arises directly from the self - consistency of the theory ) @xcite .",
    "in this section , i discuss how quasi - local eliashberg equations can be constructed , and demonstrate how the lowest - order fock diagram does not contribute to the gap equations .",
    "the calculation is intended to be demonstrative , and shows that standard eliashberg equations fail for an optical phonon mediated @xmath0-wave state .",
    "the eliashberg equations are computed from the fock contribution to the self - energy : @xmath19 and equate @xmath20 with the approximate form , @xmath21 normally the eliashberg equations are computed using a local ( momentum - independent ) approximation",
    ". however , to examine @xmath0-wave states , the local approximation is not sufficient . substituting the green function @xmath22 in eq .",
    "[ eqn : se ] ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 are pauli matrices and @xmath25 is the chemical potential ) , and treating the gap function as constant in sub - zones of @xmath26-space in the manner of dca , one obtains a quasi - local approximation for the eliashberg equations , @xmath27 when gap functions have @xmath0-wave symmetry , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and the partial dos @xmath30 has the symmetry of the lattice , it is immediately clear that the @xmath31 contribution to the quasi - local eliashberg equations vanishes , and 2nd order terms must be considered .",
    "when there is some weak momentum dependence in the e - ph coupling and phonon frequency , this cancellation will not be exact , but the contribution from 2nd - order terms can still be expected to be the largest in the perturbation series .",
    "thus a fully extended set of eliashberg equations including vertex corrections needs to be constructed .",
    "currently , it is not possible to construct a similar approximation to eq .",
    "[ eqn : qlapprox ] for the vertex corrected theory . however",
    "a numerical approach using the full dca equations is available to enlighten some aspects of the e - ph problem .",
    "the rest of this article concerns results from an extended eliashberg theory with momentum dependence and vertex corrections determined numerically using dca .",
    "no form for the order parameter is assumed in advance and full forms for the green functions and self - energies are used .",
    "full details of the translation of the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : overview](a ) may be found in ref .",
    "figure [ fig : one ] shows image plots of the electron spectral functions @xcite .",
    "vertex corrections are most pronounced for @xmath32 , as expected from analysis of the parameter space @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the vertex corrected theory shows a kink at the energy scale relating to the phonon frequency * measured * at the @xmath33 point ( i.e. renormalised zone edge phonon frequency ) in agreement with the arpes measurements in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "phonon spectral functions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] .",
    "the phonon renormalisation is extremely small for @xmath34 .",
    "in contrast , modes at the @xmath35 point in the brillouin zone are strongly softened for @xmath36 when vertex corrections are not taken into account .",
    "the second order terms act against the softening and reinforce the theory .",
    "a small reduction in spectral weight is seen mid way along the @xmath37-x and @xmath37-w lines when @xmath32 .",
    "this might be a precursor to the strong softening seen in ref .",
    "@xcite on passing through the transition temperature , but further analysis of the superconducting state is necessary to be sure .",
    "@xmath0-wave superconductivity is one of the remarkable results from the theory extended with vertex corrections .",
    "figure [ fig : three ] shows the anomalous density as the chemical potential is varied first upwards from half - filling and then back from large filling showing that two solutions are stable .",
    "a small @xmath38 is applied . @xmath39 and @xmath40 . starting with a half - filled solution and increasing , then decreasing the chemical potential , first @xmath0-wave and then ( on decreasing from high electron density ) @xmath41-wave solutions to the self - consistent equations are found ( as detailed in the caption of fig . [ fig : three ] ) .",
    "highly anisotropic solutions form as the fermi - surface approaches the van - hove points . in the @xmath0-wave state ,",
    "the first order terms are not the leading order of the perturbation theory in @xmath2 .",
    "it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that this was in part due to the nearly flat phonon spectrum , so that the phonon propagator @xmath42 and the 1st order contribution to the anomalous self - energy @xmath43 is small ( @xmath44 is the anomalous green function ) .",
    "the anomalous contribution to the pseudopotential term is @xmath45 .",
    "since @xmath44 is modulated in the @xmath0-wave state , then the contribution of the pseudopotential term is zero . in the @xmath41-wave state ,",
    "@xmath44 is not modulated , and the resulting finite contribution destroys the @xmath41-wave order for large enough @xmath46 , thus selecting a dominant @xmath0-wave contribution . the phonon spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] demonstrate that so long as @xmath47 , then this condition is met , and 2nd order terms are essential .",
    "2nd order terms remain the leading order correction to the anomalous self - energy , even for the larger @xmath2 used here .",
    "it is clear that the 2nd order terms are similar for both repulsive and attractive models , and thus it is perhaps not surprising that both attractive and repulsive models show a @xmath0-wave state .",
    "i have described spectroscopic results and order parameters from an extended eliashberg - style theory with vertex and momentum corrections .",
    "the extended theory is essential for the investigation of d - wave superconductivity mediated by optical phonons , since the vertex corrections are the lowest order terms in the perturbation expansion in electron - phonon coupling @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , d - wave superconductivity is immediately predicted with such an extension .",
    "there are two remaining areas which require further investigation .",
    "the first involves a better treatment of the coulomb repulsion , which is currently only treated as a simple hartree - fock pseudopotential . in particular ,",
    "the ability to treat large repulsion and antiferromagnetism is essential for high-@xmath48 materials .",
    "treatment of momentum dependent e - ph coupling would also be of interest .",
    "however , the overriding challenge at this stage is to convert the numerical results into a coherent analytic theory with vertex corrections ."
