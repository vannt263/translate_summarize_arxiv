    "this paper addresses the question of optimal discrimination of quantum measurements .",
    "it is organized as follows .",
    "the problem is formulated in sections [ sec : formulation ] and [ sec : mft ] . in section [ sec : perfect ] we study the conditions of perfect distinguishability .",
    "further we continue with discrimination of quantum filters in section [ sec : qfilters ] .",
    "we reduce this problem to discrimination of projective measurements which is then investigated in section [ sec : projqm ]",
    ". finally , in section [ sec : trine ] we solve unambiguous discrimination of two trine measurements demonstrating that non - maximally entangled states can outperform maximally entangled ones . section [ sec : summary ] contains the summary of the results .",
    "suppose we are given a measurement device we want to identify , however , we can use it only once .",
    "we will assume that a nontrivial prior knowledge on potential alternatives is given .",
    "in the simplest case we are distinguishing among two alternatives : the apparatus performs either a measurement @xmath5 or a measurement @xmath6 with a priori probabilities @xmath7 , @xmath8 , respectively . our goal is to design a test that would ( optimally ) identify the unknown measurement device .",
    "we will distinguish between two types of tests : _ simple ( ancilla - free ) _ and _ general ( ancilla - assisted ) _ experimental setting ( see figure  [ fig : schemes ] ) .",
    "the simple scheme consists of the preparation of a test state probing the unknown measurement device and of a post - processing assignment of a conclusion for each individual measurement outcome .",
    "in contrast , the most general ( ancilla - assisted ) scheme begins with a preparation of a bipartite quantum state part of which is then measured by the unknown measurement device .",
    "the obtained outcome @xmath9 is used to determine the measurement of the remaining part of the bipartite system .",

    "part @xmath12 depicts the general discrimination scheme , in which a bipartite state is prepared ; one part of it is measured with the unknown measurement device and the other part by a known ancillary measurement chosen conditionally on the actual outcome @xmath9 recorded in the unknown measurement .",
    ", width=302 ]    if the measurements @xmath5 , @xmath6 are not in a specific mutual relation allowing for perfect discrimination , it is obvious that all the conclusions can not be always valid .",
    "the way how the imperfections are evaluated and processed is then used for definition of optimality .",
    "each conclusion is characterized by the probability of being wrong ( error probability ) . to evaluate the reliability of the conclusions of the discrimination test we use the following three quantities : i ) _ error probability _",
    "@xmath13 defined as the average error probability ( over all conclusive outcomes ) ; ii ) _ failure probability _ @xmath14 given as a total probability of inconclusive outcomes ; iii ) _ success probability _ @xmath15 .    when all the outcomes are conclusive , i.e. @xmath16 , and we optimize the average success probability then we speak about _ minimum - error _ discrimination strategy . on the other side of the spectrum of discrimination problems we find the _ unambiguous _ discrimination , for which @xmath17 , but inconclusive outcomes are possible .",
    "the optimality is achieved when @xmath14 is minimized . in this paper",
    "we will consider also intermediate variations of the discrimination problems , which include the mentioned strategies as `` extremal '' cases .",
    "in particular , we will consider maximization of average success probability @xmath18 for a fixed value of the failure probability @xmath14 .",
    "in such case we say we implement _ discrimination with fixed failure rate_. we say the measurements can be _ perfectly discriminated _",
    "if @xmath14 and @xmath13 can vanish simultaneously .",
    "let us denote by @xmath19 the @xmath20 dimensional hilbert space of the quantum system under consideration .",
    "the measurement device @xmath5 is a positive operator valued measure assigning a positive operator @xmath21 for each @xmath22 ( we will not consider measurements with infinite , or uncountable number of outcomes ) .",
    "we can represent any measurement as a specific measure - and - prepare channel @xmath5 @xmath23 mapping states of @xmath19 into diagonal density operators on @xmath24 ( probability distributions on @xmath25 ) , where @xmath24 is @xmath26dimensional hilbert space spanned by fixed orthonormal basis @xmath27 .",
    "further , we will assume that all the measurements we want to discriminate have the same number of outcomes .",
    "using this representation of measurements the problem of discrimination can be reformulated as a special case of ( quantum - classical ) channel discrimination , hence , the general results obtained for ( single - shot ) discrimination of channels can be directly translated into the language of measurements .",
    "in what follows , we demonstrate mathematical formulation of a discrimination problem for its simples version when the measurement device is guaranteed to be one of two known alternatives .",
    "generalization to any number of measurements is straightforward .",
    "let us denote by @xmath28 the test procedure we use to discriminate between a pair of measurements @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( @xmath6 corresponding to povm elements @xmath29 ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath30 the conditional probability that if the measurement @xmath31 was tested by the test procedure @xmath28 conclusion @xmath32 was obtained . here",
    "@xmath33 marks that the procedure has failed and @xmath34 , @xmath35 corresponds to identification of the measurement device as @xmath31 , @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "the fact that the test procedure @xmath28 fails with fixed probability @xmath14 can be mathematically stated as : @xmath37 we define @xmath38 the probability of error and the probability of success and clearly @xmath39 . our goal is to maximize the probability of success @xmath18 for a fixed value of the failure rate @xmath14 .",
    "this is equivalent to minimization of the relative error rate @xmath40 or maximization of the relative success probability @xmath41 for fixed value of @xmath14 .",
    "the mathematical framework for the description of test procedures @xmath28 ( so - called quantum testers , or process povms ) was introduced and developed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this framework",
    "the measurements are described by choi - jamiolkowski operators @xcite assigned to corresponding quantum - to - classical channels .",

    "let us first address the case of perfect discrimination .",
    "this is an intriguing quantum information theory question , because the maximal number of simultaneously perfectly distinguishable measurements reveals the information `` capacity '' of measurement devices .",
    "it is known that for states this number coincides with the dimension of the hilbert space , thus , provides its operational meaning .",
    "there are @xmath65 perfectly distinguishable unitary channels ( e.g. pauli operators in case of qubit ) and this property is exploited in superdense coding @xcite to double the information transmission rate of noiseless communication with @xmath20-level systems .",
    "surprisingly , a nontrivial insight on perfect discrimination comes from the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the concept of boundariness was introduced . based on the close relation between boundariness and minimum - error discrimination we know that perfect discrimination is possible only between boundary elements ( for details see section iv of @xcite ) .",
    "let us stress that this feature holds also for states and channels .",
    "in particular , the results of ref .",
    "@xcite imply that for each measurement @xmath5 from the boundary there exist a measurement @xmath6 ( also belonging to the boundary ) such that @xmath5 and @xmath6 are perfectly distinguishable .",
    "the channel representation of measurements makes the problem of discrimination of observables a special case of the channel discrimination .",
    "it follows @xcite that for the minimum - error discrimination of equiprobable measurements @xmath5 and @xmath6 the optimal error probability is given by the following formula @xmath66 where @xmath67 denotes the completely bounded ( cb ) norm @xcite .",
    "in general , it is difficult to evaluate this norm , because it requires inspection of the behaviour of the map when tensorized with identity channel @xmath68 on @xmath9 dimensional hilbert space @xmath69 .",
    "@xmath70(\\rho)\\|_{\\rm tr},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 denotes the trace norm .",
    "unfortunately , the following example demonstrates that although the measurements represent a special type of channels ( with classical outputs ) , the perfect discrimination can not be , in general , restricted to simple ( ancilla - free ) schemes only , i.e. @xmath72    * example 1 * ( _ perfect discrimination without simple scheme _ ) . [ lem : perfect2 ] let us consider a pair of symmetric three - outcomes qubit measurements @xmath73 where @xmath74 , @xmath75 . applying these measurements on one part of a singlet state @xmath76 of two qubits the other part ( ancilla )",
    "is projected into two orthogonal states for any of the ( equiprobable ) outcomes @xmath59 .",
    "for example , outcome @xmath77 heralds the ancilla state @xmath78 in case of measurement @xmath5 and state @xmath79 in case of @xmath6 .",
    "thus , for @xmath77 the perfect discrimination can be achieved by distinguishing orthogonal states @xmath79 , @xmath78 .",
    "similarly , for @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) we would have states @xmath82 , @xmath83 ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 ) , respectively .",
    "we conclude that measurements @xmath5 , @xmath6 can be perfectly discriminated using general ( ancilla - assisted ) scheme .",
    "it remains to show there is no ancilla - free scheme for perfect discrimination .",
    "let us denote by @xmath86 and @xmath87 the probabilities of outcomes @xmath59 given the probe state is @xmath88 .",
    "for ancilla - free scheme the perfect discrimination happens if and only if each outcome @xmath59 is associated either with conclusion @xmath31 or @xmath36 and on top of that the probability of each outcome is non - vanishing for at most one of the measurements , i.e. @xmath89 ( being equivalent to the conditions @xmath90 for each @xmath59 ) .",
    "for the considered pair of measurements it follows that always at least two of the outcomes have nonvanishing probabilities , thus , the necessary condition for perfect discrimination ( @xmath91 ) can not be satisfied . in conclusion",
    ", for the discrimination of measurements the use of ancilla provides a nontrivial advantage in comparison with simple schemes .      in this section",

    "the solution has three regimes depending on the relation between the prior probability @xmath267 and overlap @xmath268 @xmath269 if the priors are very unbalanced ( first and last intervals ) then one of the states is never detected , so the optimal measurement has two outcomes and is projective . in the intermediate regime when the priors are `` comparable '' all three outcomes have non zero probability of appearance .",

    "it is clear that we need to use the ancillary measurement , since we need three outcomes .",
    "an intuitive scheme for achieving the optimal performance is based on preparing a singlet state @xmath270 of two qubits .",
    "application of the unknown measurement on one part of the state projects ( depending on the identity of the measurement ) the other part into a state @xmath138 or @xmath271 in case of outcome @xmath102 and into state @xmath137 or @xmath96 in case of outcome @xmath103 .",
