    "details of this technique are analyzed e.g. in refs .",

    "the photon state in the interferometer after passing a beam splitter is not a product state , but the states of the output ports are entangled . in recent papers by barak and ben - aryeh  @xcite and voronov and weyrauch  @xcite ,",
    "the consequences of this entanglement for the photon statistics of an optical interferometer were studied .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was suggested that under certain conditions , the gravitational wave signal may by amplified without a corresponding increase in counting noise . in ref .",
    "@xcite we disputed this surprising prediction , and showed that is was the result of an inaccuracy in the calculations .",
    "furthermore , we calculated photon distributions in the output state for various settings of a beam splitter with respect to weak and strong incoming laser fields .",
    "we showed that a squeezed vacuum injected into the other port can not amplify the signal however my reduce counting noise for large squeezing factors .    in a recent paper  @xcite",
    ", ben - aryeh specifically reanalyzes the ` dark port case ' , i.e. a configuration where the beam splitter is oriented close to 90@xmath1 to the incoming laser beam with a squeezed vacuum entering the other port .",
    "he confirms our findings in ref .",
    "@xcite and sharpens the physical interpretation of the results obtained .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to investigate the photon statistics in the dark output port of the interferometer in more detail , and present the calculations and results more succinctly than in our previous paper  @xcite .    in section  [ sec : approximation ] we develop formulas for the calculation of the photon number distributions in the dark output port of the interferometer , as well as their mean values and variances .",
    "numerical results and their physical interpretation will be discussed in section 3 .",
    "a brief summary concludes the paper .",
    "the photon field operators @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the input ports and the photon field operators @xmath4 and @xmath5 of the output ports of a beam splitter are related through the beam splitter transformation  @xcite @xmath6 both sets of operators fulfill boson commutation relations @xmath7=\\delta_{i , j}$ ] and @xmath8=\\delta_{i , j}$ ] , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath9 parameterizes the splitting ratio of the beam splitter with respect to the incoming laser beam .    the incoming laser beam in port 1 is a coherent state , and a squeezed vacuum state is injected in port 2 : @xmath10 with @xmath11 the coherence parameter @xmath12 and the squeezing parameter @xmath13 are complex numbers .",
    "the beam splitter transformation allows to write the @xmath14 operators in terms of the @xmath15 operators , and one may write the photon state after passing the beam splitter as @xmath16 and @xmath17    from the expression for @xmath18 we see that both output states are entangled by the operator @xmath19 .",
    "this fact significantly complicates evaluation of the photon statistics of the output state .",
    "however , it is possible to use lie algebraic disentangling techniques in order to rewrite the output state in a way which enables the determination of photon distributions ( for details we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    after disentangling it is possible to write eq .",
    "( [ eq : output ] ) as follows  @xcite @xmath20 . the output state is now expressed in terms of two squeezed coherent states entangled via the operators @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 are real functions of the input parameters @xmath27 and @xmath9 .",
    "a simple method for the numerical determination of these parameters is described in appendix a of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the dark port case corresponds @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a small phase shift ( we assume it is real ) , for which one finds to first order in @xmath29 ( see appendix a in ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath30 we furthermore assume a very strong coherent state incoming in port 1 , such that the @xmath31 and @xmath32 operators can be replaced in the entanglement factors in eq .",
    "( [ eq : output2 ] ) by their expectation values @xmath12 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "the output state can then be written as @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "the operators with index 1 may be combined using the relations @xmath36,\\nonumber\\\\ \\hat{d}(\\alpha)\\hat{s}(\\zeta)&=&\\hat{s}(\\zeta)\\hat{d}(\\alpha \\cosh",
    "r + \\alpha^ * { \\textnormal{e}}^{i \\theta}\\sinh r).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we finally obtain @xmath37 and @xmath38 as one can see from eq .",
    "( [ eq : outpihalf ] ) , a strong coherent state with coherence parameter @xmath12 exits through port 2 of the interferometer and a weak squeezed coherent state with coherence parameter @xmath39 and squeezing parameter @xmath13 exits through port 1 .",
    "note that in ref .",
    "@xcite there are two missprints : @xmath40 must be defined without the term @xmath41 and with opposite sign .",
    "also note , that the coherence parameter @xmath39 depends on the squeezing parameter @xmath13 , the coherence parameter @xmath42 and the phase shift @xmath29 .",
    "the phase factor @xmath43 is irrelevant for the determination of the photon statistics .    in order to determine the photon statistics of the output state we need to determine its number ( fock ) representation . in terms of the number representation of a squeezed coherent state  @xcite @xmath44 with @xmath45 and",
    "@xmath46 the hermite polynomials , one immediately obtains the distribution function @xmath47 the mean and the variance of this distribution may be obtained analytically  @xcite @xmath48 note , that the mean does not depend on the phases @xmath49 and @xmath50 , but the variance does .",
    "the results eq .",
    "( [ eq : meanvari ] ) on first sight appear different from those obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , it is possible to show that they are equivalent .",
    "the form presented here is , however , much more transparent .    finally , we would like to remark , that the mean and variance eq .",
    "( [ eq : meanvari ] ) may alternatively be calculated by a method used by caves  @xcite .",
    "he expresses the output observables , which are described by @xmath15 operators , in terms of the input operators @xmath14 using the beam splitter transformation . in this way one obtains the same results eq .",
    "( [ eq : meanvari ] ) very efficiently , however , the full distribution function is not easily obtained .",
    "we consider squeezing factors up to @xmath51 in our numerical work , since at the present time the largest squeezing factor experimentally realized is about @xmath52 corresponding to a maximum squeezing of about -11.5 db  @xcite .    from the formulas  ( [ eq : darkdist ] ) and",
    "( [ eq : meanvari ] ) we see that the mean of the photon distribution does not depend on the phases @xmath49 and @xmath50 , but the variance depends on the phase relation @xmath53 . obviously , choosing @xmath54 is optimal in the sense of minimizing the counting noise .    substituting @xmath54 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : meanvari ] ) one finds @xmath55 for strong coherent input state ( large @xmath56 ) and within the squeezing factor ranges experimentally accessible ( @xmath57 up to about @xmath58 ) the second terms in both expressions can be neglected .",
    "consequently , amplification of the signal in output port 1 by squeezing the input vacuum state is not possible .",
    "however , the width of the distribution @xmath59 decreases @xmath60 with increasing squeezing parameter @xmath57 .",

    "our results for the ` dark port ' case show that squeezing does not influence the mean of the distribution tangibly , thus there is no amplification of the signal .",
    "this result contrasts with the findings of ref .",
    "signal amplification can only be achieved by increasing the intensity of the input coherent state , that is by increasing of @xmath56 .",
    "squeezing allows to decrease the noise : for a squeezing factor @xmath61 the reduction of noise is more then @xmath62 .",
    "furthermore , our analysis shows that the mean of the distribution does not depend on the phases @xmath49 ( squeezing parameter phase ) or @xmath50 ( coherence parameter phase ) , but the variance of the distribution depends on the phase relation @xmath53 . the most appropriate choice in order to achieve minimum possible counting noise is @xmath54 .",
