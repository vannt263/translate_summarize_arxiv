    "the case of the second order phase transition was related to existence of usual van der waals like behavior . whereas , first order phase transition was due to existence of cusp .",
    "the other type of phase transition was for the cases in which around the phase transition point , the behavior of the system was opposite ( and also symmetric ) to the van der waals manner .",
    "therefore , three different behaviors were observed around critical points for these black holes . considering these three behaviors around the critical points",
    ", one can conclude that in strong higher derivative gravity the phase structure of these black holes will be drastically different and the behavior of the system will be even opposite of the van der waals behavior . to our knowledge",
