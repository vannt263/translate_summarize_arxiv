    "the extensive records of data opened new possibilities of examining communication between humans ranging from face - to - face encounters @xcite , through mobile telephone calls @xcite , surface - mail @xcite short messages @xcite to typical internet activities such as e - mail correspondence @xcite , bulletin board system ( bbs ) dialogues @xcite , forum postings @xcite or twitter microblogging @xcite .",
    "communication and its evolution is one of the key aspects of a modern life , which in an overwhelming part is governed by the circulation of information . in the most fundamental part , the communication is based on a _ dialogue _ - an exchange of information and ideas between two people @xcite .",
    "assuming an ideal situation , if the highest priority would be given to _ acquiring _ certain information , from a layman point of view",
    "the dialogue should be free from any additional components that could restrain conversation s participants from achieving the common goal .",
    "in reality , it is extremely difficult to model the dialogue complexity which , among others , would need to consider the dialogues semantic , pragmatic , social and emotional context sequences of turn - taking @xcite , let alone its attentive @xcite or contextual @xcite layers .    as compared to the off - line communication ,",
    "the exchange of information in the internet is claimed to be more biased toward the emotional aspect @xcite .",
    "it can be explained by a online disinhibition effect @xcite  the sense of anonymity that almost all internet users possess while submitting their opinions on various fora or blogs .",
    "nevertheless , it is the very internet that gives the opportunity to acquire massive data , thus making it possible to perform a credible statistical analysis of common habits in communication . as the recent research shows , it is already possible to spot certain phenomena of the internet discussion participants while looking just at the emotional content of their posts @xcite .",
    "one of them is the collective emotional behavior @xcite , the other is clear correlation between the length of discussion and its emotional content @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we argue that a simple physical approach based on the observation of entropy of emotional probability distribution during the conversation can serve as an indicator of a discussion about to finish .",
    "this process is claimed to be correlated to the emergence of the power - law distribution of the discussion length and serves as a key idea for the numerical simulations of the dialogues .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : data ] gives a brief description of the used data as well as of the emotional classification method , section [ sec : comm_feat ] presents our observations regarding the discussion length distribution , equalization of the emotional probabilities and entropy growth , in section [ sec : sim_des ] we show the description of simulations rules which results are given in section [ sec : simres ] .",
    "finally , section [ sec : app ] describes a potential application of the observed phenomenon .     comments . ]         versus the dialogue length @xmath0 . ]",
    "as a source of data for analysing online dialogues we chose the internet relay chat ( irc ) @xcite logs",
    ". some of the the major irc channels are being automatically archived by the channel operators , the logs are often accessible to a general public , and include the records of real - time , chat - like communication between numerous participants .",
    "the presented analysis is limited only to one of the channels , namely ` # ubuntu ` @xcite in the period 1st january 2007 - 31st december 2009 . in this work we focused on dialogues that included only two participants . the final output , after several levels of data processing ( for details see appendix [ sec : dialext ] ) consists of @xmath1 dialogues with the length @xmath0 between @xmath2 and @xmath3 each .",
    "each dialogue can be represented as a chain of messages ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : chain ] ) where all odd posts are submitted by one user and all even by another one .",
    "the emotional classifier program that was used to analyze the emotional content of the discussions is based on a machine - learning ( ml ) approach .",
    "the algorithm functions in two phases : during the training phase , it is provided with a set of documents classified by humans for emotional content ( positive , negative or objective ) from which it learns the characteristics of each category .",
    "then , during the application phase , the algorithm applies the acquired sentiment classification knowledge to new , unseen documents . in our analysis , we trained a hierarchical language model @xcite on the blogs06 collection @xcite and applied the trained model to the extracted irc dialogues , during the application phase .",
    "the algorithm is based on a two - tier solution , according to which a post is initially classified as objective or subjective and in the latter case , it is further classified in terms of its polarity , i.e. , positive or negative .",
    "each level of classification applies a binary language model @xcite .",
    "posts are therefore annotated with a single value @xmath4 or @xmath5 to quantify their emotional content ( to be more precise - their valence @xcite ) as negative , neutral or positive , respectively .",
    "the obtained dialogues have been divided into groups of constant dialogue length @xmath0 . for such data we follow the evolution of mean emotional value @xmath6 and average emotional probabilities @xmath7 ( @xmath6 .",
    "in both cases the @xmath8 symbol indicates taking all dialogues with a specific length @xmath0 and averaging over all comments with number @xmath9 , thus , for example , @xmath10 is the probability that at the position @xmath9 in all dialogues of length @xmath0 there is a negative statement .",
    "the characteristic feature observed regardless of the dialogue length is that the @xmath6 at the end of the dialogue is higher than at the beginning ( upper row in fig .",
    "[ fig : irc_evol ] ) .",
    "in fact , there is especially a rapid growth close the very end of the dialogue .     of consecutive emotional post of the same sign versus the size @xmath11 .",
    "full triangles , squares and circles are data points ( respectively : negative , neutral and positive messages ) , empty symbols are shuffled data , solid lines come from eq .",
    "( [ eq : alfa ] ) and dotted lines represent relation @xmath12 . ]    the direct reason for such behavior is shown in the bottom row of fig .",
    "[ fig : irc_evol ] , which presents the evolution of the average emotional probabilities @xmath10 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 . the observations can be summarized in the following way :    * the negative emotional probability @xmath10 remains almost constant , * @xmath14 increases and @xmath13 has an opposite tendency , * @xmath14 and @xmath13 tend to equalize in the vicinity of dialogue end .",
    "other manifestation of the system s features can be spotted by examining the level of the entropy @xmath15 of the emotional probabilities @xmath7 .",
    "entropy or other information theoretic quantities as mutual information @xcite , kullback - leiber divergence @xcite or jensen - shannon divergence @xcite have been already used to quantify certain aspects of human mobility @xcite , semantic resemblance or flow between wikipedia pages @xcite or correlations between consecutive emotional posts @xcite . moreover , basing on entropy , it has also been shown how the coherent structures in the e - mail dialogues arise @xcite or how to predict conversation patterns in face - to - face meetings @xcite . in this paper , the entropy",
    "is used after shannon s definition @xcite , i.e. , @xmath16 here , taking into account the fact that @xmath10 is constant in the course of dialogue , we paid attention only to @xmath14 and @xmath13 , thus the observed entropy had a form of @xmath17 .",
    "\\label{eq : s}\\ ] ]    plotting the difference between terminal and initial entropy @xmath18 versus the length of the dialogue @xmath0 it is possible to see that for the dialogues up to @xmath19 this difference is always above zero ( see fig . [",
    "fig : irc_ent ] ) .",
    "it implies a following likely scenario for the dialogue : it evolves in the direction of growing entropy . in the beginning of the dialogue ,",
    "the probabilities @xmath13 and @xmath14 are separated from each other , contributing to low value of initial entropy @xmath20 . however , then the entropy grows , the probabilities @xmath13 and @xmath14 equalize leading to high value entropy ( i.e. , higher than the initial one ) at the end of the dialogue .",
    "however , it is essential to notice that the observed behavior in the irc data is only one of the possible scenarios of the more general phenomenon of the principle of maximum entropy @xcite , governing also certain aspects of biological @xcite or social systems @xcite ( at the level of social networks ) . to be more precise , we performed an analysis analogous to this for the irc data with respect to emotionally annotated dataset from the bbc forum ( see @xcite and @xcite ) consisting of over @xmath21 comments and almost @xmath22 discussions . in this case",
    "each discussion was treated as a natural `` dialogue '' , although it usually consisted of more than 2 users communicating to each other . following the line of thought presented for irc data we grouped all discussion of constant length and calculated the quantities @xmath10 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath23 .",
    "the results , shown in fig . [ fig : bbc_ent ] , bear close resemblance to those obtained for irc data : one can clearly see that while the negative component decreases , the positive and objective ( partially ) ones increase .",
    "it has an instant effect on the value of entropy which grows during the evolution of the discussion ( topmost row in fig .",
    "[ fig : bbc_ent ] ) .",
    "the main difference between irc and bbc forum results concerns the component whose value decreases during the discussion evolution : for irc it is the @xmath13 while for bbc forum - @xmath10 .",
    "it is directly connected to the fact that the above mentioned components play the role of `` discussion fuel '' @xcite propelling thread s evolution .",
    "bbc forum data come from such categories as `` world news '' and `` uk news '' and as such may lead the discussion participants to place comments of very negative valence . on the other hand ` # ubuntu ` irc channel servers rather as a source of professional help which is normally expressed in terms of neutral dialogue .",
    "as the discussion lasts , the topic dilutes ( bbc forum ) or the problem is being solved ( irc ) and the dominating component dies out leading to maximization of entropy .",
    "there is also another process taking place in the system in question that displays a non - trivial behavior . as shown previously in @xcite , we can talk about grouping of similarly emotional messages . to quantify the persistence of a specific",
    "emotion one can consider the conditional probability @xmath24 that after @xmath11 comments with the same emotional valence the next comment has the same sign . as it easy to prove , if @xmath25 were an identical and independently distributed ( i.i.d .",
    ") variable the conditional probability @xmath24 should be independent of @xmath11 and equal to @xmath26 , i.e. , the probability of a specific emotion in the whole dataset ( see table [ tab : irc_prop ] ) in the case of the irc data , the analysis shows ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : irc_clust ] ) that @xmath24 is well approximated by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the conditional probability that two consecutive messages have the same emotion .",
    "the discrepancy between the data and the relation obtained by random insertion of emotional comments ( see open symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : irc_clust ] ) is significant .",
    "the exponents @xmath29 and the conditional probabilities @xmath28 are gathered in table [ tab : irc_prop ] .",
    ".fundamental properties of dialogue data : probabilities of specific emotion @xmath26 , conditional probabilities @xmath28 and scaling exponents for the power - law cluster growth @xmath30 . [ cols=\"<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     in total , we used 994 daily files with 4600 to 18000 utterances that share a format presented in the first column from the left in table [ tab : irc_data ] : @xmath31 @xmath32 $ ] @xmath33 @xmath34 with the @xmath35 @xmath36 used as marker for the emotional valence through this study . moreover , we could also use information that specifies which user communicates , i.e. , directly addresses , another user ( see second column in table [ tab : irc_data ] , shown as @xmath37 ) .",
    "the discovery of the direct communication links between two users in the irc channel was based on the discovery of another userid at the beginning of an utterance , followed by a comma or semicolon signs ; a scheme commonly used in various multiple users communication channels .",
    "however , one has to bear in mind that this kind of information can be sometimes incomplete , i.e. , in many cases users do not explicitly specify the receiver of his / her post .",
    "another issue that arises is that the data consist of several overlapping dialogues held simultaneously on one channel .",
    "it is also sometimes difficult to indicate the receiver of the message as only part of them are annotated with a user i d they are dedicated to .",
    "we created an algorithm that addresses this issue .",
    "it consists of two different approaches :    1 .",
    "if user a addresses user b in some moment in time and later a writes consecutive messages without addressing anybody specific we assume that he / she is still having a conversation with b 2 .",
    "if user a addresses user b and then b writes a message without addressing anybody specific we assume that he / she is answering to a.    the main parameter of such algorithm is the time @xmath38 in which the searching is being done ; in our study we use @xmath39 minutes as the threshold value . an exemplary output from the algorithm",
    "is shown in the third column in table [ tab : irc_data ] . in this way we are able to extract a set of dialogues from each of the daily files .",
    "after processing the file according to above described rules another issue emerges : it often happens that a user gives a set of consecutive messages directed to one receiver ( e.g , the 8th , 10th and 11th line in the third column in table [ tab : irc_data ] ) . to create a standardize version of the dialogue ( a to b , b to a , a to b and so on ) , we decided to accumulate the consecutive emotional messages of the same user , calculate the average value @xmath40 in such series and then transform it back into a three - sate value according to the formula @xmath41\\\\ e^{i}=0 & & \\bar{e } \\in ( -\\frac{1}{3};\\frac{1}{3})\\\\ e^{i}=1 & & \\bar{e } \\in [ \\frac{1}{3};1]\\\\ \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] in effect we obtain the set shown in the fourth column in table [ tab : irc_data ] .",
    "the final step of the data preparation is to divide it into separate dialogues as shown in the 5th column in table [ tab : irc_data ] . in total",
    ", the algorithm produces @xmath1 dialogues with the length between @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( all the dialogues with @xmath44 were omitted ) .",
