    "a hard smbhb may stall at the parsec scale for a timescale longer than the hubble time in the spherical and isotropic galactic nuclei @xcite , but can be driven to the strong gravitational wave ( gw ) regime at milliparsec scale by efficient stellar dynamical processes in non - spherical , anisotropic , and/or rotating nuclear clusters @xcite , or by hydrodynamic processes in massive gas disks ( * ? ? ?",

    "smbhbs can dramatically change the tidal disruption rates of stars in galactic nuclei .",
    "our investigations showed that stellar tidal disruption rates by ultra - compact smbhbs , particularly in the gw dominated regime , are at least one order of magnitude lower @xcite , while those by bound ( but not - hard ) smbhbs @xcite or dual smbhs in merging galaxies @xcite can be up to three orders of magnitudes higher than the estimated tidal disruption rates by single smbhs in isolated galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , despite the significant difference in the tidal disruption rates , the separate contributions of stellar tidal disruptions by single , bound and hard binaries , and dual smbhs to the total stellar disruption events during cosmic time are comparable to one another @xcite , implying that some of the observed tidal disruption flares are probably from smbhb systems .",
    "numerical and analytic computations indicated that the stellar tidal disruption flares in smbhb systems would show temporary interruptions and recurrences .",

    ", we introduce the fallback model for tidal disruptions of stars by smbhs and give some general constraints on the model parameters for sdss j1201 + 30 , based on the observations given by s2012 . in section  [ bin ] , we briefly describe the model for stellar tidal disruption in a smbhb system ( section  [ intr : an ] ) and present the numerical results of employing the binary black hole model to sdss j1201 + 30 in section  [ mod ] .",
    "we show that the observed light curve in x - rays can be well reproduced by a simple smbhb model . in particular , the question of whether smbhb orbits show eccentricity is important , both for the evolution of smbhbs in galactic nuclei and the detection of gw radiation . we explore the effect of the orbital eccentricity of smbhbs on the light curves , and",
    "show that the orbit of the smbhb in sdss j1201 + 30 must be elliptical , if the central black hole has a mass @xmath8 in section  [ ecc ] .",
    "after critically investigating the alternatives in section  [ sec : alt ] , we provide our discussion of the orbital parameters of the smbhb system in sdss j1201 + 30 in section  [ sec : para ] , the gw emission of the smbhb system in section  [ sec : gw ] , and the frequency of smbhbs among known tdes in section  [ sec : freq ] . throughout the paper ,",
    "we assume a @xmath9cdm cosmology with parameters @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "a star of mass @xmath13 and radius @xmath14 is tidally disrupted , if it passes by a smbh with mass @xmath15 at a distance less than the tidal radius @xmath16 @xcite , where @xmath17 is of order unity . because @xmath17 is degenerate with the other model parameters and can not be constrained independently , we adopt @xmath18 for simplicity .",

    "the spin - up of the star depends on the penetration factor @xmath33 . for a tidal disruption with @xmath34 as in sdss j1201 + 30 ( see discussions below ) and because @xmath35 is degenerate with @xmath36 , we take @xmath37 as fiducial value . for a tidal disruption of penetration factor @xmath36 ,",

    "the initial total energy of the star @xmath22 is usually assumed to be negligible in the literature ( except , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) because stars approaching from the smbh influence radius dominate the tdes in single smbh systems with spherical isotropic distributions of stars in the galactic nuclei ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "this is then inconsistent with the observations of sdss j1201 + 30 .",
    "for typical nuclear star clusters around smbhs in the galactic nuclei , the fraction of stars with @xmath50 is negligible .",
    "therefore , we assume @xmath51 or @xmath52 and neglect @xmath53 in the discussions of the tde in sdss j1201 + 30 from now on . however , this does not imply that the star is necessary from the influence radius of the smbh .",
    "the observations of the tidal flare in sdss j1201 + 30 are consistent with the predictions of the canonical fallback model for stellar tidal disruption . in the canonical fallback model ,",
    "the stellar plasma after tidal disruption distributes evenly in specific energy @xmath19 between @xmath54 and @xmath23 .",
    "therefore about half of the stellar plasma gains energy and is ejected away from the system , while the other half loses energy and becomes bound to the smbh .",
    "the bound stellar plasma follows keplerian orbits with extremely high eccentricities and falls back to the pericenter at a mass rate @xmath55 @xcite , where @xmath56 is the epoch of disruption and @xmath57 is the return time of the most bound stellar debris to the pericenter @xmath58 equation  ( [ eq : tmin ] ) implies that @xmath57 strongly depends on @xmath36 , a parameter that can not be given a priori .",
    "we take @xmath36 as a free parameter and determine it observationally .",
    "thus , we consider only the tidal disruption of solar - type stars and all the uncertainties are absorbed into @xmath36 .",
    "after the bound stellar debris falls back to pericenter , it quickly circularizes at radius @xmath59 due to strong shocks between incoming and outgoing stellar plasma streams , leading to accretion onto the smbh @xcite .",

    "the accretion rate @xmath69 becomes less than 0.01 and the accretion mode probably becomes advection dominated @xcite . for a period of order of years ,",
    "in which we are interested here , we have @xmath70 at high - states , and thus do not consider the change of accretion mode from radiatively efficient to inefficient .    to relate the fallback rates of stellar plasma to the observed x - ray flux in the 0.2 - 2 kev band , we need to know the ratio of the x - ray and bolometric luminosity , the transfer efficiency of matter to radiation , the fraction of the advected and photon - trapped energy into the smbh , the fraction of the disk outflow to the total matter , the contribution and absorption of the disk corona , the amount of reflection , and the disk orientation .",
    "because most of the processes can not be determined from first principles , we simply adopt l_x = f_x c^2 , [ eq : fl_mat ] with @xmath71 a free parameter to be fixed observationally .",

    "to obtain @xmath73 , we have used all the detections of sdss j1201 + 30 given in table 1 of s2012 except the observation on 2010 november 23 which was strongly affected by radiation . because @xmath71 in equation  ( [ eq : fl_mat ] ) and @xmath57 in equation  ( [ eq : mdot ] ) are degenerate and can not be determined independently by fitting the observational data",
    ", we can give only an upper limit to @xmath57 as @xmath74 .",
    "if @xmath38 , from equation  ( [ eq : tmin ] ) we have @xmath75 thus the tidal disruption of the star in sdss j1201 + 30 should occur inside the tidal radius with @xmath34 . for @xmath76 , @xmath77 is independent of @xmath36 , which gives a constraint on @xmath35 alternatively @xmath78    the above analyses were carried out in newtonian gravity .",
    "however , the disrupted star has a pericenter @xmath79 and general relativity ( gr ) effects are important for a smbh with mass @xmath80 . to take the gr effect into account",
    ", we use the pseudo - newtonian potential @xmath81 @xcite in our numerical simulations .",
    "thus , equation  ( [ eq : de ] ) is rewritten @xmath82 with a larger maximum specific energy @xmath23 , equation  ( [ eq : tmin ] ) gives a smaller @xmath57 , leading to a larger @xmath36 and stronger gr effects .",
    "when sdss j1201 + 30 becomes invisible to _ swift _ during 2010 july 7 and july 28 , the flux in x - rays decreases by more than 47 times within seven  days from the last detection of 2010 june 30 .",
    "although the present observations can give only upper limits to the decay timescale with @xmath83 , and to the duration of being invisible in x - rays with @xmath84 , due to gaps in the observed light curve , we still have @xmath85 and can give severe constraints on the possible models for the origin of the intermittence of the tidal flare . here",
    "we explore in detail the smbhb model as suggested by llc09 , and give a discussion on alternatives in section  [ sec : alt ] .    in the smbhb model ( llc09 ) , the orbits of the less - bound and unbound stellar plasma change due to the strong perturbation by a massive object at a distance of several hundreds of schwarzschild radii .",
    "then , a significant fraction of the stellar plasma can not fall back to form an accretion disk and to fuel the smbh , leading to an intermittence of accretion onto the smbh , and thus of the tidal flare . because the massive perturber must be compact in order for it to survive the tidal force of the central smbh ,",
    "it is most probably a second smbh . before we",
    "numerically show how well the observations of sdss j1201 + 30 can be reproduced by the theoretical light curves predicted by the smbhb model in the section  [ mod ] , we first briefly introduce and discuss the merits of the smbhb model .",
    "after a star is tidally disrupted by a smbh , the viscous interaction among the stellar plasma is negligible and the plasma fluid elements move ballistically with keplerian orbits before they fall back to the pericenter and circularize because of strong shocks among the stellar tidal plasma @xcite . for the ultra - bound fluid elements of keplerian orbits with semi - major axis , much less than that of the smbhb ( hierarchical triple systems )",
    ", the orbits of the fluid elements evolve secularly under the perturbation of the secondary smbh on the kozai - lidov time scale @xcite , which is much larger than the keplerian periods of the stellar fluid elements .",
    "the orbital angular momentum change , within one keplerian period of the fluid elements , due to the torque caused by the quadrupole force of the secondary is @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are , respectively , the semi - major axis of the fluid elements and the smbhb . because the relative change of the orbital angular momentum of the fluid elements @xmath89 is very small",

    "@xmath90 is the ratio of masses of the secondary and primary smbhs .",
    "when the fluid elements are less bound with semi - major axes @xmath91 , the analytical and numerical simulations show that the orbits of the fluid elements become chaotic and change significantly on a keplerian timescale @xcite due to the nonlinear overlap of the multiple resonances @xcite . from equation  ( [ eq : amratio ] ) , we obtain the relative change of the orbital angular momentum of the fluid elements with @xmath92 on keplerian time @xmath93 and the fluid elements would move with chaotic orbits of pericenter @xmath94 , which is much larger than the pericenter @xmath29 at disruption .",
    "therefore , the fluid elements move with chaotic orbits significantly different from one another .",
    "they neither fall back to the pericenter at disruption , nor cross each other to form shocks and accretion . the transition radius , or corresponding keplerian time @xmath95 of the fluid elements from secular to chaotic orbits , depends critically on the orbital parameters of the stars and also of the smbhb system , but @xmath95 can relate to the smbhb orbit period , with @xmath96 ( llc09 ) .",

    "the tidal disruption of stars with different internal structures would lead to different light curves with different peak luminosities , peak time @xmath397 , and power - law indices other than @xmath398 @xcite . because the key features of the interruptions and recurrences in the model light curves do not change with the structure of the star , our conclusions regarding the model solutions and the parameters are robust . for a certain orbital pericenter , equation  ( [ eq : dep ] )",

    "notice that in figure  [ fig : all9 ] @xmath401 with @xmath402 the tidal radius of a solar - type star .",
    "we have carried out numerical simulations to scan a significant fraction of the large model parameter space , but it is still prohibitive for the present computing powers to cover the whole space of the parameters ( @xmath170 , @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath36 , @xmath153 , @xmath166 , @xmath252 , and @xmath15 ) . from the first principles , the potential sphere of the restricted three - body systems consisting of the smbhb and the stellar plasma elements",
    "is split into inner and outer regions by the smbhb orbit .",
    "as argued for newtonian potential analytically by @xcite and numerically by llc09 , the shell of the potential sphere centered on the smbhb orbit is chaotic because of the nonlinear overlap of the multiple resonances due to the strong perturbations by the secondary smbh .",
    "the fluid elements with orbits inside the chaotic shell regions are resonantly scattered off and thus the inner and outer boundaries of the chaotic shell regions determine , respectively , the interruption and recurrence time of the tde light curve . for a circular smbhb orbit , the orbit of the smbhb",
    "binary roughly determines the centers of the chaotic regions , suggesting that the keplerian orbital period of the smbhb is roughly between the time of the interruption and recurrence .",
    "the bh mass ratio determines the strength of the resonant perturbation , the extent of the nonlinear overlap of multiple resonances , and how effectively the fluid elements with orbits inside or crossing the chaotic shell regions are scattered off on the timescale when they move inside the chaotic shell , deciding the duration and shapes ( e.g. , smooth or flickering ) of the interruptions and the recurrent light curves .",
    "the orbital parameters of the star could modify the characteristics of the key features of the smbhb system only moderately . the high - quality x - ray light curve obtained by s2012 did not only catch the time of the interruption , the recurrence , and the re - interruption of the tde , but also constrains well the long durations of the phases of low and high flux .",
    "the long duration of the recurrence suggests that the resonant perturbation by the secondary bh should not be too strong and the merger should not be a major merger with @xmath403 , while the long duration of the interruption implies that the perturbation can not be too weak and the merger should not have an extreme mass ratio @xmath404 irrespective to the detailed modeling of the light curve .",
    "therefore , the solutions with @xmath405 are certain . with a moderate small mass ratio @xmath406 , the duration of the recurrent flare should not be much longer than the observed one , suggesting that the time of recurrence should not be much earlier than the first detection of the recurrent flare and the smbhb orbital period is about the time of recurrence .",
    "therefore , the model solutions with @xmath407 are robust , too . however , we have to notice that the orbital period of the smbhb is the keplerian period , but the return time of the bound stellar plasma elements is determined by the radial epicyclic frequency .",
    "the keplerian and epicyclic frequencies are equal in newtonian gravity , but the latter is smaller than the former in gr .",
    "the differences between the two frequencies become significant for tidal disruptions by the smbh with @xmath408 because the tidal radius for a solar - type star is @xmath409 . therefore , for the certain orbital period @xmath153 , the time of the interruption in the model light curves is delayed so much that it is significantly later than the date of the first upper limit , which , for a smbhb system with circular orbit , is hardly compensated by adjusting the other parameters . to significantly shift the time of interruption to an earlier date , we need an elliptical orbit for the smbhb system . for the smbhb system with the given orbital period ,",
    "the moderate eccentricity decreases significantly the pericenter and thus the inner boundary of the chaotic shell region , resulting in the appearance of the interruption before the first upper limit on 2010 july 7 and after the last detection on 2010 june 30 .",
    "therefore , we expect that the solution for @xmath0 with @xmath289 is robust .      upon final",
    "coalescence , smbhb systems like the one in are prime sources for future space - based gw missions like _",
    "elisa_. however , in its current state of evolution , it would be challenging to detect the gws from this system .",
    "it would radiate gw emission at a frequency @xmath410 in the observer frame , and with a characteristic strain in an observation of duration @xmath411 @xmath412 with @xmath413 is the strain amplitude at the object rest frequency , @xmath414 @xmath415 where @xmath416 is the `` chirp mass '' of the smbhb and @xmath417 is the comoving distance .",
    "the frequency @xmath418 is in the range observable with ptas , but much smaller than that of _",
    "elisa_. for a five - year pta observation , the expected characteristic strain of the binary is @xmath419 which is about four orders of magnitude smaller than the detection limit of pta at the frequency @xmath420 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if gw radiation was the only contribution to the orbital shrinkage , the lifetime of the system is @xmath421 @xcite , where @xmath422 is a function of the eccentricity @xmath252 @xmath423 for a smbhb system with @xmath0 and typical parameter values @xmath382 , @xmath271 , and @xmath269 , the life time is @xmath424 , while for a smbhb system with @xmath342 and the parameter values @xmath425 , @xmath192 and @xmath426 , the life time is longer , with @xmath427 .",
    "however , a longer life time @xmath428 does not necessarily imply that the @xmath429 fit is favored , nor that tde light curve searches for smbhbs are biased toward systems with larger separations and smaller smbh masses for a given observed binary period .",
    "this is because of the biases in event detection in any ( x - ray , transient ) survey , which preferentially selects for the most luminous , most frequent events . in particular , x - ray surveys are biased toward smbhs of higher mass @xmath430 because of their higher peak luminosities .",
    "further , the tde rate @xmath431 is a function of @xmath88 .",
    "a preliminary estimation suggests that @xmath431 is a complicated function of @xmath88 and does not change significantly for @xmath432 @xcite .",
    "thus , for a given observed @xmath153 in an x - ray transient survey , a smbhb system with higher smbh mass @xmath433 and smaller separation within the range of @xmath434 would be likely favored .",
    "approximately 20 to 25 tdes and candidates have been identified from the observations ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) , including the x - rays ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , uv @xcite , optical and emission lines @xcite , and gamma - rays ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we have inspected these light curves , with the exception of the two jetted tdes , in order to search for similar features as seen in sdssj1201 + 30 .",
    "none are clearly present .",
    "this might have several reasons .",
    "it could be due to the gaps in the light curves of the tdes ( and so escaped detection ) .",
    "alternatively , the orbital timescales of the smbhbs can be longer or shorter , and so their effects would be undetectable on the timescales observed so far .",
    "currently , this then makes sdss j1201 + 30 the only good smbhb candidate among the known tdes .    in summary",
    ", we conclude that the smbhb model for sdss j1201 + 30 is a viable model that naturally explains the abrupt dips and recoveries of the x - ray light curve of the event .",

    "<S> galaxy mergers play a key role in the evolution of galaxies and the growth of their central supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) . </S>",
    "<S> a search for ( active ) smbh binaries ( smbhbs ) at the centers of the merger remnants is currently ongoing . </S>",
    "<S> perhaps the greatest challenge is to identify the * _ inactive _ * smbhbs , which might be the most abundant , but are also the most difficult to identify . </S>",
    "<S> liu et al . predicted characteristic drops in the light curves of tidal disruption events ( tdes ) , caused by the presence of a secondary smbh . here </S>",
    "<S> , we apply that model to the light curve of the optically inactive galaxy sdss j120136.02 + 300305.5 , which was identified as a candidate tde with _ xmm - newton_. we show that the deep dips in its evolving x - ray light curve can be well explained by the presence of a smbhb at its core . a smbhb model with a mass of the primary of @xmath0 , a mass ratio @xmath1 , and a semimajor axis @xmath2 is in good agreement with the observations . </S>",
    "<S> given that primary mass , introducing an orbital eccentricity is needed , with @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , a lower mass primary of @xmath4 in a circular orbit fits the light curve well . </S>",
    "<S> tight binaries like this one , which have already overcome the `` final parsec problem , '' are prime sources of gravitational wave radiation once the two smbhs coalesce . </S>",
    "<S> future transient surveys , which will detect tdes in large numbers , will place tight constraints on the smbhb fraction in otherwise non - active galaxies . </S>"
