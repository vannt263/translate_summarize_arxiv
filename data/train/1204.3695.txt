    "the value of turbulent diffusivity also scales with the initial width of the gaussian function @xmath1 .",
    "using a wider gaussian function makes the larger size of the convection cell work more efficiently and generates a larger value of turbulent diffusivity .    in the mean field model",

    "we discuss the dependence of @xmath4 on the box size with @xmath94 and @xmath75 . with a smaller box , i.e. @xmath55 ( case 2 ) and @xmath56 ( case 3 ) ,",
    "the characteristic lengths are almost the same as the sizes of the boxes ( the size of the box is indicated by the dashed line ) .",
    "it is natural that the largest cell size is determined by the size of the box and that the largest cell is most effective for advecting the passive scalar .",
    "although we expected that the characteristic length of case 1 would also be the same as @xmath69 , the obtained characteristic length scale was smaller than @xmath69 even with @xmath94 and @xmath75 .",
    "a possible reason for this result is that the characteristic length @xmath4 is restricted by the convection cell , which is also limited vertically by the pressure scale height ( @xmath36 ) or the density scale height ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "although @xmath4 should be evaluated in the horizontal scale , the mixture of the passive scalar may occur at approximately the same distance with the vertical scale .",
    "it should also be noted that when the narrowest gaussian function , i.e. @xmath73 ( red line ) , is used , the characteristic lengths are restricted by the width of the gaussian function in cases 1 and 2 .",

    "although the qualitative relation is not clear , it indicates that the estimated error @xmath101 tends to become smaller with a larger ratio @xmath102 of the initial width of gaussian function to the characteristic length ( @xmath103 )",
    "we investigated the value of horizontal turbulent diffusivity @xmath0 by a numerical calculation of thermal convection . in this study , we have introduced a new method , whereby the turbulent diffusivity is estimated by monitoring the time development of the passive scalar , which is initially distributed in a given gaussian function with a spatial scale @xmath1 .",
    "our conclusions are as follows : ( 1 ) assuming the relation @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the rms velocity , the characteristic length @xmath4 is restricted by the shortest one among the pressure ( density ) scale height and the region depth . ( 2 ) the value of turbulent diffusivity becomes larger with a larger initial distribution scale @xmath1 .",
    "( 3 ) the approximation of turbulent diffusion holds better when the ratio of the initial distribution scale @xmath1 to the characteristic length @xmath4 is larger .",
    "conclusion ( 2 ) is consistent with the results of observational study @xcite and a previous numerical study . in this study",
    ", we do not estimate the correlation length directly from the thermal convection .",
    "this will be achieved in our future work with an auto - detection technique and our characteristic length ( @xmath4 ) will be compared with directly estimated correlation length .",
    "we now assume that our characteristic length is an average of correlation length at each height ( iida et al . in prepareation ) .",
    "the turbulent diffusion in the horizontal directions is estimated in this work , but such estimations are also important in the vertical directions for addressing the solar dynamo problem from the viewpoint of the transport of magnetic flux from the surface to the bottom of the convection zone",
    ". such a study will be conducted in the future .    although turbulent diffusivity averaged in the whole box",
    "is estimated in this study , the dependence of this estimation on the height is important .",
    "there are , however , two reasons why it is difficult to estimate this dependence with our method .",
    "first , in our calculations the integrated passive scalar density is not conserved at each height .",
    "second , we found that it is difficult to estimate the diffusivity separately for each horizontal plane only by solving eq .",
    "( [ advection ] ) two - dimensionally in the @xmath104 plane the because the results show that the passive scalar density is strongly concentrated in the boundaries of the convection cells .",
    "such a spatially intermittent structure is inappropriate for obtaining a statistical property like the turbulent diffusivity .",
