    "over the last half century , significant advances have been made in understanding the dynamics of coupled oscillators . since the pioneering work of winfree @xcite and kuramoto @xcite , the nonlinear dynamics community has been able to use both analytical and numerical techniques to study the onset of synchronization and to explore other types of dynamics , including varying degrees of coherence and incoherence , in a broad class of oscillator networks .    before 2002",
    ", divergent behaviors such as incoherence and coherence were thought to result from heterogeneities .",
    "however , kuramoto and battogtokh showed that even networks of identical oscillators could split into regions of coherence and incoherence @xcite . since this surprising discovery",
    ", these `` chimera states '' have been reported in a vast array of network topologies @xcite including spatially embedded networks like a ring of oscillators @xcite , a torus @xcite , and a plane @xcite .    here",
    "we study the dynamics of kuramoto oscillators on the surface a unit sphere @xmath0 . in this system , the phases @xmath1",
    "are governed by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a continuous coupling kernel .",
    "we choose to study this system for several reasons .",
    "there are homeomorphisms ( continuous deformations ) from the sphere to many common closed two - dimensional surfaces embedded in three dimensions ; spheres are topologically equivalent to all kinds of different surfaces with physical and biological relevance .",
    "our results suggest that chimera states are likely to occur for oscillators on any orientable closed surface @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the sphere is a geometry in which both spot and spiral chimera states appear in very simple forms .",
    "these two unique dynamical patterns have yet to be connected from an analytical perspective .",
    "spiral chimeras on the sphere show an intriguing similarity to patterns of activity displayed by the human heart during ventricular fibrillation @xcite .",
    "we analyze the dynamics of this system with near - global coupling and demonstrate the existence of spot and spiral chimera states in the perturbative limit .",
    "then , using a variety of numerical and analytical techniques , we explore the role of the coupling length and phase lag @xmath4 in determining the existence and stability of these unusual patterns ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spot_and_spiral_plot ] ) .",
    "in two - dimensional spatially embedded networks of identical oscillators , two different classes of chimera states have been reported : spots and spirals . for spot chimeras ,",
    "oscillators form spots of incoherence and coherence . in the coherent region ,",
    "all oscillators share the same phase . for spiral chimeras ,",
    "a region of incoherence is surrounded by a coherent region . in the coherent region ,",
    "the phases of the oscillators make a full cycle along any path around the incoherent spot .",
    "thus the lines of constant phase resemble spiral arms around an implied phase singularity at the center of the incoherent region .",
    "spot chimeras were discovered first .",
    "their bifurcations @xcite and stability @xcite have been studied extensively with near - global coupling .",
    "when @xmath4 is near @xmath5 , unstable and stable spot chimeras bifurcate off of the fully synchronized and drifting states respectively and then disappear due to a saddle node bifurcation .",
    "thus they only exist near the hamiltonian limit @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "spiral chimeras are not as well understood .",
    "they were reported by shima and kuramoto on an infinite plane @xcite .",
    "their existence was confirmed analytically by martens et al .",
    "@xcite , but their bifurcations and stability have not yet been studied from an analytical perspective .",
    "numerical experiments have suggested that they are only stable when @xmath4 is near 0 ( a dissipative limit ) and when the coupling is more localized @xcite .",
    "we consider the special case where the coupling kernel is defined as @xmath7 this is known as the von - mises - fisher distribution @xcite and represents the analog of a normal distribution on a sphere .",
    "the variance ( coupling length ) of this distribution is inversely related to the concentration parameter @xmath8 . as @xmath9 ,",
    "@xmath10 representing purely local coupling .",
    "when @xmath11 , @xmath12 representing global coupling .",
    "we are interested in the role this concentration plays in the dynamics .    following the approach of kuramoto and battogtokh @xcite , we shift into a rotating frame with angular frequency @xmath13 and define a complex order parameter , @xmath14 equation can be rewritten in terms of the order parameter and the frequency difference @xmath15 revealing two types of stationary solutions : where @xmath16 , oscillators become phase - locked with a stationary phase , and where @xmath17 , they can not become phase - locked but instead drift with a stationary phase distribution . in",
    "both the locked and drifting regions , these stationary solutions must satisfy a self - consistency equation @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 .    to reduce the dimensionality of this system , we parametrize the surface of the sphere using the mathematical convention for spherical coordinates @xmath21 where @xmath22 represents the azimuthal angle and @xmath23 represents the polar angle and restrict our search to solutions of the form    [ self_c_ans ] @xmath24    where @xmath25 is an integer .",

    "when @xmath26 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( and therefore @xmath47 ) depend only on @xmath23 , so integration with respect to @xmath48 is possible giving @xmath49 .",
    "thus the order parameter takes the form @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "this yields two equations : @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes complex conjugation .",
    "motivated by the results from @xcite we look for solutions that scale like    [ scaling ] @xmath54    expanding in @xmath8 and defining @xmath43 we obtain the following conditions at leading order :    [ self_c_10 ] @xmath55+i\\beta_1~ , \\label{self_c_10a}\\\\    a_2 + ib_2 & = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{a_2 ^ 2}\\bigg[\\frac{2\\delta}{3}\\left(\\left(\\delta - a_2\\right)^{3/2}-\\left(\\delta+a_2\\right)^{3/2}\\right)\\nonumber\\\\&-\\frac{2}{5}\\left(\\left(\\delta - a_2\\right)^{5/2}-\\left(\\delta+a_2\\right)^{5/2}\\right)\\bigg]~.     \\label{self_c_10b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that @xmath56 was required to satisfy the equations at @xmath57 .",
    "the real part of eq .",
    "depends only on @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "thus we can fix @xmath58 , solve for @xmath59 , and then compute the other unknowns directly .",
    "the parameters @xmath59 and @xmath58 determine the variation in the order parameter and the size of the drifting region . using matcont @xcite , a numerical continuation software package for matlab , we find the solutions to eq .   and display them in fig .",
    "[ fig : spot_res](a ) .",
    "figure [ fig : spot_res](b ) shows the fraction drifting as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "these solutions resemble the spot solutions observed in refs .   in that",
    "unstable spot chimeras bifurcate off of a phase - locked state and stable spot chimeras bifurcate off of a modulated drift state . at a critical value of @xmath60 ,",
    "the chimera states disappear due to a saddle node bifurcation ( see appendix [ app_snb ] ) .",
    "this explains the change in stability observed in panel ( b ) .",
    "the stability of these solutions was confirmed via numerical integration of eq .  .",
    "no higher order spirals ( @xmath28 ) occur to lowest order in @xmath8 because all terms in eq .",
    "integrate to 0 . for @xmath27 , on the other hand , @xmath61 and @xmath62 ,",
    "so eq .   yields an order parameter of the form @xmath63 without loss of generality , we can define the argument @xmath64 to be 0 along the half plane @xmath65 and making @xmath66 real .",
    "this implies that @xmath67 and @xmath68 . defining @xmath69 , substituting this result into eq .  , and",

    "solving eq .",
    "reveals that like spot chimeras , spiral chimeras represent a link between coherence and incoherence ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : smallk_spiral_sc ] ) .",
    "we find that when @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "this leads to a fully locked solution in which the phases depend only on the azimuthal variable @xmath22 ( a `` beachball '' pattern ) . as @xmath4 increases from 0 ,",
    "incoherent spiral cores are born at the poles of the sphere and grow until @xmath6 .",
    "when @xmath6 , @xmath79 , and the sphere is fully incoherent .",
    "although these spirals resemble the spirals reported in refs .  , numerical experiments suggest that these states are unstable .",
    "they only seem to gain stability when coupling is more localized .      to search for stable spiral chimera states , we now explore the dynamics when @xmath8 is not small .",
    "with highly localized coupling , the effects of curvature are negligible , and the sphere can be approximated locally as a plane .",
    "martens et al",
    ".  showed that , on an infinite plane , spiral chimera states appear when @xmath4 is small .",
    "motivated by these findings , we consider the limit where @xmath80 and assume the following scalings    [ scalings ] @xmath81    expanding eq .   in @xmath4 to leading order yields @xmath82 which can be integrated numerically to find @xmath83 .",
    "to @xmath84 we find that @xmath85 thus @xmath86 and @xmath87 satisfy an inhomogeneous fredholm equation of the second kind which can be solved numerically .",
    "this asymptotic approach decouples the magnitude of the order parameter from its argument making it possible to solve for each separately .",
    "it also allows a nonlinear equation to be approximated by a series of linear equations and can be used to find higher order approximation to @xmath88 and @xmath89 as well .",
    "these results can be used to estimate the size of the incoherent region at the center of the spiral . to see this ,",
    "let @xmath90 represent the boundary between the locked and drifting regions . to order @xmath4 , the boundary satisfies @xmath91 there are two solutions to this equation that are symmetric about the equator , one with @xmath92 and one with @xmath93 . to find the size of the incoherent region with @xmath92 , we expand @xmath94 about @xmath95 , @xmath96 substituting eq .   into eq .  , integrating with respect to @xmath97 , and solving for @xmath98 yields @xmath99 thus , near the birth of the chimera state the size of the incoherent region grows with @xmath4 .",
    "since @xmath87 is @xmath8 dependent but its scaling with @xmath8 is unknown , the dependence of the size of the incoherent region on @xmath8 can not be determined using eq .  .",
    "however , given a numerical solution for @xmath34 and @xmath36 , the value of @xmath98 is readily apparent and the size of the drifting region can be easily calculated ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fracs ] in appendix [ app_ns ] ) .",

    "this software package uses newton s method to allow the user to continue equilibria of systems of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) and to detect bifurcations .    for numerical continuation",
    ", we defined @xmath101 and rewrote eq .   as @xmath102 the known spiral solutions for @xmath103 are nearly sinusoidal , therefore it is natural to represent them by a fourier sine series @xmath104 where @xmath105 in fourier space , it is straightforward to show that the fixed points of    @xmath106    [ matcont_f2 ]    where @xmath107 and @xmath108 denote real and imaginary parts and @xmath109 represents solutions to eq .  .",
    "equation was imposed to eliminate the extra degree of freedom in eq .",
    "( invariance under rotations @xmath110 ) .",
    "the nonlinearity of equation made it unlikely that numerical methods would converge to the correct solution without an accurate initial guess .",
    "so , we began with the solutions for @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 derived for @xmath100 and @xmath80 and then implemented a variety of algorithms in order to numerically continue spiral chimera states over the parameter space @xmath120 and @xmath132 .",
    "the simplest approach we implemented was a naive iterative method .",
    "eq .   has the form @xmath133 . given an initial guess for the solution to eq .",
    "@xmath134 ( in practice we used a discrete set of @xmath23 values ) , we updated our solution as follows : +   + _ step 1 : _",
    "+ define @xmath135 .",
    "_ step 2 : _ + choose @xmath136 to minimize @xmath137 .",
    "_ step 3 : _ + update @xmath138 .",
    "+   + to carry out numerical continuation using this heuristic scheme , we selected a known solution as a starting point made a small change to one of the parameters , and then iterated until the residual @xmath139 was small .",
    "this method is not guaranteed to converge , but for a starting point sufficiently close to the true solution and steps that were sufficiently small , it did allow us to identify solutions for new ranges of @xmath4 and @xmath8 .      in order to improve upon the above , we implemented a second similar method .",
    "we again started with a known solution and made a small change to either @xmath4 or @xmath8 .",
    "then , we utilized a quasi - newton method ( as implemented in the matlab function fminunc ) to find the values of @xmath103 and @xmath36 that minimized the error : @xmath140 this method seemed to be more stable than the iterative approach , but it was more computationally intensive .      both of the above methods used zeroth order extrapolation to generate a starting point for the next set of parameter values . to improve upon this method we also used first order extrapolation to generate the next starting point .",
    "for example , to continue in @xmath8 , given @xmath141 and their associated solutions for @xmath36 and @xmath103 , we used a linear approximation to generate a guess at @xmath142 .",
    "this guess was then used as a starting point for the above methods . although the above approaches did yield marginal gains in exploring @xmath4 vs.  @xmath8 space ,",
    "ultimately the time and memory demands were far too large to adequately explore the domain of interest due to the small step sizes required for convergence .",
    "we found that matcont was the most effective method for numerically continuing spiral chimera states .",
    "our first attempt at writing eq .   as a system of odes ,",
    "the input format required by matcont , used a discretized version of eq .   on a uniform grid of 101 points between @xmath143 .",
    "unfortunately , the algorithm was unable to identify an appropriate search direction for continuation .",
    "instead we represented @xmath103 as a fourier sine series as described in the main text .",
    "for @xmath100 , @xmath103 is sinusoidal , thus only the first fourier coefficient is nonzero .",
    "as @xmath8 increases subsequent terms become more important . for @xmath144 , @xmath145",
    "so , we truncated the series after 16 terms ( inclusion of higher frequency modes does not significantly change the results ) .",
    "we then verified the accuracy of these solutions by substituting them directly into equation .",
    "the integrals in eqs .   and",
    "were evaluated using simpson s rule with 101 grid points .",
    "we terminated continuation when the change in @xmath8 over 10 steps was less than @xmath146 .",
    "the endpoints ( @xmath113 ) of the curves obtained from matcont were somewhat irregular . to address this , we compiled all of the solutions from matcont and used spline interpolation and extrapolation to generate guesses for missing solutions .",
    "then , using the optimization method described above we refined the guesses until the optimization scheme terminated and computed the error for these new points using eq .  .",
    "if the norm of the error was less than @xmath147 , we accepted the result as a solution to eq .  .",
    "this allowed us to extend our results to higher values of @xmath8 .",
    "the results from numerical continuation of spiral chimeras are displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig : op_sols ] and [ fig : spiral_stability ] .",
    "we find that spiral chimera states satisfying eqs .   and continue to exist for @xmath111 .",
    "near @xmath76 and @xmath6 , we were able to continue these solutions indefinitely in @xmath8 .",
    "for intermediate values of @xmath4 the numerical continuation fails prematurely at @xmath112 .",
    "attempts at continuing beyond this point by increasing the number of fourier coefficients retained , refining the grid for numerical integration , and continuing using alternative methods ( see appendix [ app_nc ] ) yielded incremental increases in @xmath113 .",
    "this suggests that the failure of convergence is due to narrowing of the basin of attraction for the numerical solution and increasingly sharp transitions in the shape of the solutions , however we can not rule out a failure of existence due to a bifurcation .",
    "qualitatively these spirals resemble the ones observed for @xmath100 .",
    "they are symmetric with respect to reflections about the equator . however , instead of straight spiral arms ( lines of constant phase ) where @xmath114 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : op_sols ] , bottom panels ) , these solutions have curved spiral arms with @xmath115 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : op_sols ] , top panels ) .",
    "the fraction of oscillators drifting is zero for @xmath76 and increases with @xmath4 until the entire sphere is incoherent when @xmath6 .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : spot_and_spiral_plot ] for an example .",
    "spot chimeras appear to exist for arbitrary @xmath8 and seem qualitatively similar to solutions for @xmath100 ( see appendix [ app_scwlc ] ) .      in order to test the stability of these solutions , we approximated eq .   by selecting 5000 points uniformly distributed on the surface of a sphere @xcite , generating initial conditions consistent with the order parameters obtained through numerical continuation ( see appendix [ app_gic ] ) , and integrating for 5000 units of time ( 10 - 1000 cycles of the locked oscillators , depending on the values of @xmath4 and @xmath8 ) .",
    "after this interval , if the final state possessed a phase distribution that was nearly identical to the initial state ( except for possible drifting of the incoherent region ) we classified the chimera state as stable .",
    "we observed a narrow strip with stable chimeras extending down to @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "we believe that , to conform with the planar case explored in ref .  , this strip is likely to originate from @xmath118 and @xmath119 ( in this limit the coupling is so localized that the curvature of the sphere becomes irrelevant ) .",
    "near the boundaries of this strip , solutions remained close to the initial condition for most of the integration time before evolving toward a fully coherent state or spiral pattern without an incoherent region , suggesting that spiral chimera states outside of the strip were unstable . at the moment",
    "we have no analytical explanation for the observed changes in stability .",
    "one possibility is that the states we refer to as stable are actually just very long - lived transients .",
    "however , that raises the question of why this particular strip would have dramatically longer transient times than neighboring regions of parameter space .",
    "another possibility is that stability changes due to some as of yet unidentified bifurcation .",
    "this bifurcation can not be due to the presence of a spot chimera because of the topological differences and the fact that spot chimeras do not exist near the boundaries of this region , but it could be due to other equilibrium spiral patterns that only satisfy ansatz at the bifurcation point .",
    "this work demonstrates the existence of both spot and spiral chimera states on the surface of a sphere .",
    "we find that both spirals and spots represent links between coherence and incoherence . in agreement with previous results ,",
    "when coupling is nearly global , spot chimeras only exist near the hamiltonian limit ( @xmath6 ) whereas spiral chimeras exist for all values of @xmath120 . for more localized coupling",
    ", numerical results suggest that both types of chimera states continue to exist , but that they have disjoint regions of stability .",
    "a puzzling apparent failure of existence of chimera states for localized coupling and intermediate phase lags ( @xmath121 ) remains to be explained .",
    "more broadly , we have demonstrated that the surface of a sphere provides an interesting testbed for assessing the properties of chimera states ",
    "one in which analogs of many previously reported chimera states exist .",
    "although the underlying cause is the same , this topology leads to visually distinct patterns from other two dimensional systems  on a plane , single spirals appear , whereas , on a torus , spirals only appear in multiples of 4 and on a sphere spirals appear in pairs . the result that both spiral and spot chimera states occur over a wide range of parameter values in these systems suggests that chimera states may be possible in any network of non - locally coupled oscillators on a closed , orientable surface .",
    "in particular , the topological resemblance of a sphere to real - world systems makes this geometry potentially valuable for applications to naturally occurring biological oscillatory networks ( e.g. the human heart and brain , where chimera states could be associated with dangerous ventricular fibrillation or epileptic seizure states ) .    the authors would like to thank c.  laing for useful conversations .",

    "we observed that some of the unstable chimeras with @xmath4 near @xmath5 and @xmath148 evolved into spot chimeras .",
    "this suggests that spot chimeras remain stable for larger values of @xmath8 . as a result",
    ", we believe spot chimeras with localized coupling warrant further exploration .",
    "in many systems , the basin of attraction for a chimera state is small compared with the basins of attraction of the uniform coherent and incoherent states . since chimera states can only be observed in simulations when the initial condition is inside these basins , completely random initial conditions are unlikely to converge to a chimera .",
    "it is also difficult to determine the structure of the basins of attraction of equilibrium points in high dimensional systems .",
    "so , the most effective method for observing a chimera states in simulation is to select an initial condition very close to the chimera .",
    "such an initial condition can be found given a solution for the order parameter @xmath149 and the natural frequency in the rotating frame @xmath15 by using the method outlined below .    after making the transformation @xmath150 to shift into a rotating frame of reference , eq .",

    "unfortunately the nonlinear eigenvalue problem in our system results in a complex nonlinear integral equation with a nonseparable kernel which we were unable to solve analytically .",
    "there are various limitations to using numerical integration to ascertain information about stability in this system .",
    "first of all , numerical integration itself introduces error . to address this , we used matlab s built in adaptive runge - kutta method ode45 for integration and verified that the results were consistent with those obtained using other ode solvers . to accelerate computations ,",
    "large matrix operations were carried out on a nvidia geforce gtx 570 gpu with 480 cores using the parallel computing toolbox , a matlab implementation of nvidia s cuda platform .",
    "second , choosing uniformly distributed points on the surface of a sphere is a non - trivial problem .",
    "there are various heuristic methods for generating points that are approximately uniformly distributed .",

    "@xcite . by selecting evenly spaced points along a spiral from the north pole to the south ,",
    "one obtains nearly `` uniformly '' distributed points .",
    "the slight nonuniformity means that some oscillators may be weighted slightly more heavily than others in the network .",
    "third , the lifetime of chimera states can depend on the number of grid points .",
    "previous work with spot chimeras has suggested that they are stable states with an infinite number of oscillators and long - lived transients with a finite number @xcite .",
    "the lifetime of these metastable chimera states grows with the number of oscillators , but so does the computation time .",
    "for the figures displayed in this paper , we chose to use 5000 oscillators as a compromise allowing for full exploration of parameter space in a reasonable amount of time .",
    "our results were robust to variations in the number of oscillators ( we also tried 2500 , 8000 , and 10000 for selected cases of interest ) .",
    "however , there is no guarantee that the stability with a finite number of oscillators will agree with that when @xmath166 .",
    "note that even when the number of grid points is large , for some parameter values ( e.g. , small @xmath4 for spiral chimeras ) the number of points within the incoherent region may still be small ( see fig .  [ fig : fracs ] ) , leading to inaccurate numerical assessment of stability ( this is the origin of the yellow region in fig .  [",
    "fig : spiral_stability ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the effective coupling length given by is proportional to @xmath167 , so the number of grid points must grow with @xmath8 if a minimal number are to be included within the `` coupling zone '' where coupling strength is significant .",
    "finally , numerical integration can not truly determine stability .",
    "we integrated eq .   for 5000 units of time .",
    "this termination criteria is somewhat arbitrary and could lead to unstable but long - lived transient states being classified as stable . in our analysis , we found that the boundaries of the `` stable '' region did change slightly depending on the termination criteria .",
    "however , we also tested a subset of points in the domain and verified that they appeared stable after 10000 units of time .",
    "both 5000 and 10000 time units are orders of magnitude longer than the transient lifetime of a typical chimera state that we identify as numerically unstable .",
    "figure [ fig : vels ] shows the typical pattern of phase velocities distributed on the sphere for both stable spot and stable spiral chimera states .",
    "the final pattern of phase velocities was used in conjunction with the final pattern of phases to distinguish between stable and unstable chimera states ."
