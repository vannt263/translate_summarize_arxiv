    "since 2004 , over a dozen milky way satellites have been discovered via slight statistical overdensities of individual stars in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) catalog and confirmed by both follow - up imaging and spectroscopy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "these satellites are dominated by old stellar populations and have absolute magnitudes of @xmath8 mag .",
    "their median @xmath9 is @xmath10 @xmath54 , less luminous than the median observed for milky way globular clusters ( gcs ; * ? ? ?",
    "stellar kinematics consistent with mass - to - light ( m / l ) ratios @xmath11 100 demonstrate that most of these objects are dark matter dominated dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "four of the new milky way companions - willman 1 , botes ii , segue 1 and segue 2 - contain @xmath12 and have been difficult to classify . with estimated @xmath13 of 20  40 pc ,",
    "these four objects lie in a gap between the sizes of known old stellar populations ( milky way gcs and dwarf spheroidals ) in size - luminosity space .",
    "they are less luminous than all but three known objects classified as globular clusters , providing few stars bright enough for kinematic study ( @xcite ) . moreover , their proximity to the milky way ( @xmath14 kpc ) and their possible embedding in the sagittarius stream ( botes ii and segue 1 and 2 , @xcite - although see @xcite ) complicate the interpretation of their observed properties .    measuring",
    "the dark mass content of satellites with @xmath15 is a critical ingredient to our understanding of the size and mass scale of dark matter clustering , the abundance and distribution of dark matter halos , and the extreme low mass limit of galaxy formation . @xcite and @xcite showed that milky way companions fainter than @xmath16 could not have been discovered at all in sdss if they are more distant than @xmath10 50 kpc from the sun .",
    "they may thus represent the tip of an iceberg of such objects around the milky way ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , these objects have been shown to be excellent targets for observations seeking the gamma - ray signature of annihilating dark matter @xcite .",
    "two primary lines of reasoning have been used to argue for dark matter content in , and thus a galaxy classification for , these four extreme objects : i ) a kinematic distribution that is unbound without dark matter ( segue 1 and 2 : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and/or ii ) a spectroscopically observed spread in [ fe / h ] , which is not expected in purely stellar systems with a total mass as low as the observable baryonic masses of the ultra - faint dwarfs ( willman 1 : * ? ? ?",
    "thus far , the strongest evidence for a substantial dark mass component has been provided by the line - of - sight velocities of stars in the segue 1 object .",
    "@xcite analyzed 24 member stars observed with deimos to find @xmath17 .",
    "simon et al .",
    "( in preparation ) confirm this result with a larger sample of 71 member stars .",
    "circumstantial lines of reasoning have also been used to argue that botes ii may contain a substantial dark matter component @xcite .",
    "the reliability of these kinematic or spectroscopic [ fe / h ] analyses of nearby dwarf galaxies hinge on having samples of member stars that are as contamination free as possible , and a quantitative calculation of the unavoidable contamination that may be present .",
    "contaminants may be stars from the milky way , from unrelated stellar streams such as sagittarius , or from an unbound component of the dwarf galaxy itself . with a set of only @xmath10 10 - 50 member star velocities ,",
    "a small number of interlopers could artificially inflate the observed velocity dispersion , leading to an overestimate of the mass - to - light ratio . with only a few stars in each of these systems bright enough for a spectroscopic [ fe / h ] measurement , just one or two interloper stars at bright apparent magnitudes could mimic an [ fe / h ] spread .",
    "foreground milky way thick disk and halo stars ( at the photometric depths reachable by spectroscopy ) contaminate the color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of these extreme satellites .",
    "segue 1 and botes ii have systemic velocities of @xmath5206 @xmath6 1.3 km  s@xmath4@xcite and @xmath5117 km  s@xmath4@xcite , respectively , which are offset from the majority of thick disk and halo stars . however , both willman 1 ( @xmath18 km  s@xmath4 , @xcite ) and segue 2 ( @xmath19 km  s@xmath4 , @xcite ) have systemic velocities that substantially overlap with the velocities of milky way stars , making the identification of interlopers particularly difficult .",
    "willman 1 ( wil 1 ; sdss j1049 + 5103 ) , located at ( @xmath20 ) , is an old , metal - poor milky way satellite at a distance of @xmath21kpc with @xmath0 mag @xcite .",
    "based on equilibrium models of its mass , this object has been claimed to have a high dark matter content @xcite .",
    "a high dark matter content plus its relative proximity would make it a promising source of gamma - rays from annihilating dark matter @xcite . as a result of this prediction ,",
    "several groups have attempted to investigate the particle nature of dark matter via gamma - ray @xcite and x - ray @xcite observations .",
    "however , its possibly irregular spatial distribution supports the idea that it is tidally disturbed @xcite which could mean that its kinematics do not faithfully trace its gravitational potential .",
    "although @xcite argued that wil 1 s classification of a dwarf galaxy was supported by an observed spread in the [ fe / h ] of its member stars , such spectroscopic studies of wil 1 suffer particularly from the presence of interloper stars .",
    "its systemic velocity is similar to the velocities of milky way foreground stars with colors and magnitudes consistent with wil 1 membership .",
    "@xcite showed that contamination from milky way stars was a problem in the @xcite study and found that @xmath22 of the 7 wil 1 spectroscopic red giant branch `` members '' were actually milky way foreground stars .",
    "these foreground stars might have generated the apparent spread in [ fe / h ] .    to address the present uncertainties in the nature of the wil 1 object , we present deimos observations of 45 probable member stars .",
    "we carefully characterize the possible contamination in this sample , and then use it to study the abundances and kinematics of stars in wil 1 . in  [ sec_data ] we discuss target selection and data reduction for our deimos slitmasks . selecting wil 1 member stars , including a detailed discussion of foreground contamination",
    "is presented in  [ sec_members ] . in ",
    "[ sec_dwarf ] , we discuss whether wil 1 appears to be a star cluster or a dwarf galaxy , and then analyze wil 1 s kinematics in  [ sec_kin ] .",
    "the data are from wide - field imaging of wil 1 with the mosaic imager on the 4 m at kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) on april 7 and 8 , 2005 .",
    "the reduction , photometry and calibration of these data used in this paper is identical to that presented in @xcite .",
    "we briefly describe here the reduction , photometry , and photometric calibration of these data .",
    "see @xcite for more details .",
    "ten 600s exposures were taken through each of the sdss @xmath23 and @xmath24 filters , with seeing varying between 1.2@xmath25 and 1.4@xmath25 .",
    "photometry was performed on each individual exposure and then averaged to yield a stellar catalog with excellent photometry and star - galaxy separation at the apparent magnitudes we are investigating .",
    "stellar magnitudes were photometrically calibrated with the sdss data release 4 @xcite stellar catalog .",
    "the apparent magnitudes were then corrected for extinction using the @xcite dust map values given in the sdss catalog .",
    "the average e(g - r ) along the line of sight to wil 1 is 0.014 .",

    "figure  [ fig_cmd ] shows the cmd of all point sources within two elliptical half - light radii of the center of wil 1 , using the structural parameters derived by @xcite .",
    "the points in this cmd delineate the main sequence of wil 1 , with candidate red giant branch ( rgb ) stars visible .",
    "dotted boxes outline the liberal color - magnitude selection that we will use in the rest of this paper as the color - magnitude requirements for possible wil 1 membership .",
    "we applied the color - magnitude selection shown in figure 1 to this photometric catalog to calculate a revised center of willman 1 .",
    "we began with the center , based on the much shallower sdss dataset , calculated by @xcite , and then iteratively calculated the average position of stars within 2 arcminutes of the center until we converged on ( @xmath28 ) = ( 162.3397,51.0508 ) .",
    "we will use this center for the rest of the paper .",
    "stars in wil 1 were targeted for spectroscopy using the photometric catalog described in the previous section .",
    "we set the target priorities to preferentially observe stars with a high likelihood of being wil 1 members based on their color , magnitude and spatial position .",
    "first priority was given to stars that ( 1 ) spatially overlap the main body of wil 1 and ( 2 ) reside within regions of the color - magnitude diagram that are consistent with the main sequence ( ms ) and turnoff , horizontal branch , and red giant branch of an old stellar population at the distance of wil 1 .",
    "these color - magnitude criteria are shown by the dotted lines overplotted on figure  [ fig_cmd ] .",
    "we chose to implement liberal , rectangular color - magnitude criteria to include wil 1 member stars with a range of possible [ fe / h ] and ages in our spectroscopic sample .",
    "second priority was given to stars occupying a similar color - magnitude region , independent of spatial location .",
    "all remaining stars were assigned third priority . within each of these three tiers",
    ", stars were further prioritized by their apparent magnitude , with the brightest stars receiving highest priority .",
    "an average of 100 slitlets were placed on each mask ( see table  1 ) .",
    "four multislit masks were observed for willman  1 using the keck  ii 10-m telescope and the deimos spectrograph @xcite .",
    "three masks were observed on the nights of november 2022 , 2006 , the fourth was observed on march 20 , 2007 .",
    "exposure times , mask positions and additional observing details are given in table  1 .",
    "the masks were observed with the 1200  line  mm@xmath4 grating covering a wavelength region @xmath29 .",
    "the spatial scale is @xmath30  per pixel , the spectral dispersion of this setup is @xmath31 , and the resulting spectral resolution is @xmath32 ( fwhm ) .",
    "slitlets were @xmath33 wide .",
    "the seeing conditions during both runs were on average @xmath34 .",
    "despite the similar observing conditions , few spectra were usable from the fourth mask because the targeted stars were fainter .",
    "the minimum slit length was @xmath35 to allow adequate sky subtraction ; the minimum spatial separation between slit ends was @xmath36 ( three pixels ) .",
    "spectra were reduced using a modified version of the spec2d software pipeline ( version  1.1.4 ) developed by the deep2 team at the university of california - berkeley for that survey .",
    "a detailed description of the two - dimensional reductions can be found in @xcite .",
    "the final one - dimensional spectra are rebinned into logarithmically spaced wavelength bins with 15 km  s@xmath4  per pixel .",
    "we measure radial velocities and estimate velocity errors using the method detailed in @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to this paper for a description of the method and only highlight the important steps below .",
    "radial velocities were measured by cross - correlating the observed science spectra with a series of high signal - to - noise stellar templates .",
    "the templates were observed with keck / deimos using the same setup as described in   [ ssec_redux ] and cover a wide range of stellar types ( f8 to m8 giants , subgiants and dwarf stars ) and metallicities ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath37 to @xmath38 ) .",
    "we calculate and apply a telluric correction to each science spectrum by cross correlating a hot stellar template with the night sky absorption lines following the method in @xcite .",
    "the telluric correction accounts for the velocity error due to mis - centering the star within the @xmath33 slit caused by small mask rotations or astrometric errors .",
    "we apply both a telluric and heliocentric correction to all velocities presented in this paper .",
    "it is crucial to accurately assess our velocity errors because the internal velocity dispersion of willman  1 is expected to be comparable to the deimos velocity errors associated with individual measurements .",
    "we determine the random component of our velocity errors using a monte - carlo bootstrap method .",
    "noise is added to each pixel in the one - dimensional science spectrum .",
    "we then recalculate the velocity and telluric correction for 1000 noise realizations .",
    "error bars are defined as the square root of the variance in the recovered mean velocity in the monte - carlo simulations . the systematic contribution to the velocity error",
    "was determined by @xcite to be 2.2 km  s@xmath4  based on repeated independent measurements of individual stars , and has been confirmed by a larger sample of repeated measurements .",
    "while we did not place stars on multiple masks in the willman  1 dataset , the systematic error contribution is expected to be constant as this is the same spectrograph setup and velocity cross - correlation routines are identical .",
    "we add the random and systematic errors in quadrature to arrive at the final velocity error for each science measurement .",
    "the fitted velocities were visually inspected to ensure the reliability of the fit .",
    "radial velocities for 111 stars of the 423 objects targeted passed this visual inspection . for the rest of this paper , we only consider the 97 of those 111 stars that have spectra with @xmath39 , and that have velocity uncertainties of less than 10 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "the median velocity uncertainty of these 97 stars is 3.5 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "the median velocity uncertainty in the subsample of those stars most likely to be wil 1 members is 4.7 km  s@xmath4 , because the faintest of these 97 stars are dominated by main sequence stars belonging to wil 1 .",
    "all velocity histograms shown in this paper thus have a binsize of 4.7 km  s@xmath4 .      in  3.3 and  3.4 we will use the relative stellar abundances imprinted on these spectra to identify likely bright member stars , and to compare with stars observed by the segue survey . in ",
    "4.1 we will then calculate the absolute [ fe / h ] abundances of three bright member stars . we describe here the techniques used to measure those relative and absolute abundances .",
    "to assess relative stellar abundances , we use the reduced equivalent width ( w@xmath40 ) of the ca ii lines .",
    "we utilize two functional forms of w@xmath40 , one which has been calibrated for low metallicity stars @xcite and the standard @xcite calibration . for both",
    ", we measure the cat lines at @xmath41 , and @xmath42 using the continuum and line definitions described in @xcite to calculate @xmath43 .",
    "we determine the uncertainty on @xmath43 with the monte carlo method described above .",
    "added in quadrature to the monte carlo uncertainties is a systematic uncertainty of @xmath44 , determined using the same method described in @xcite , but using a larger sample of repeated measurements .    throughout the paper",
    ", we primarily report the value of the @xcite definition of w@xmath40 such that @xmath45 and w@xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 is the @xmath47-band magnitude of each rgb star and @xmath48 is the magnitude of the horizontal branch . to obtain @xmath47",
    ", we convert our sdss @xmath23- and @xmath24-band magnitudes into @xmath47-band using the photometric transformations given in tables 1 and 2 of @xcite .",
    "the apparent @xmath47 magnitude of the one spectroscopically confirmed star in the flat part of wil 1 s horizontal branch is 18.45 mag .",
    "although this approach minimizes assumptions , using a single star to determine @xmath49 introduces a possible offset into our w@xmath40 calculations ; if the star is variable then its current apparent magnitude may not equal its average value .",
    "however , @xcite found no rr lyrae stars in wil 1 in their time - series imaging of the object .",
    "regardless , a small shift the @xmath48 we use to calculate w@xmath40 would not affect any conclusion of this paper .",
    "we also use the metallicity calibration detailed in @xcite to calculate [ fe / h ] from w@xmath40 , where w@xmath40 is defined as @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "this study excluded the ca ii line at @xmath52 because it is the weakest of the three lines and has been shown to contribute more to the relative uncertainty than the two stronger lines @xcite .",
    "the cat-[fe / h ] relation presented in @xcite was calibrated for rgb stars in the metallicity range @xmath53 \\sim -0.5 $ ] and which lie within @xmath54 or @xmath55 .    to derive the absolute abundances of bright member stars , we use the spectral synthesis method of @xcite ( kgs08 ) .",
    "this method relies on comparing an observed medium - resolution spectrum with a grid of synthetic spectra covering a range of effective temperature ( @xmath56 ) , surface gravity ( log @xmath23 ) , and composition .",
    "all of our spectra with high enough s / n for this technique are bright enough to be in the sdss database , so we determine v and i for each star by transforming the sdss @xmath57 magnitudes with the relationship derived by @xcite .",
    "kgs08 found that uncertainty in the measured colors , ages , and alpha - abundances of stars does not substantially affect the estimated @xmath56 and log @xmath23 .",
    "the best - matching composition is then found by minimizing residuals between the observed spectrum and a smoothed synthetic spectrum matched to the deimos spectral resolution . to derive error bars on the best - matching [ fe / h ] , we calculate @xmath58 contours for every star by allowing both [ fe / h ] and @xmath56 to vary .",
    "we separately varied @xmath56 by @xmath59 k and @xmath60 k and log @xmath23 by @xmath61 dex and @xmath62 dex .",
    "the surface gravity makes almost no difference in [ fe / h ] because there are no visible ionized fe lines in red giants in the observed spectral range .",
    "changing @xmath56 by @xmath63 k yields a @xmath64[fe / h ] of 0.13 dex and by an unrealistically large @xmath65 k yields a @xmath64[fe / h ] of 0.26 dex for each star we study in this paper .",
    "kgs08 found that their technique measured [ fe / h ] with 0.25 ( 0.5 ) dex accuracy on spectra of galactic globular cluster stars with s / n @xmath10 20 ( @xmath10 10 ) @xmath66 . the success of this method has been confirmed by a comparison with high - resolution abundances of over 100 stars in gcs , the halo field , dwarf galaxies , and of six rgb stars with @xmath53.3 @xmath67 [ fe / h ] @xmath67 @xmath52.3 in the ultra - faint dsphs @xcite .",
    "to study the stellar population and kinematic properties of wil 1 , we need to identify a sample of member stars with minimal contamination from interlopers .",
    "wil 1 lies at relatively high galactic latitude @xmath68 = @xmath69 . however , its systemic velocity is @xmath70 km  s@xmath4  @xcite and the median velocity of all milky way stars in the direction of wil 1 is @xmath71 km  s@xmath4  using the besancon galaxy model @xcite .",
    "in addition to overlapping in velocity , stars in wil 1 have colors and magnitudes very similar to the colors and magnitudes of stars in the milky way s thick disk and halo .    in this section ,",
    "we use color , magnitude , and velocity to select an initial sample of 45 wil 1 candidate member stars .",
    "we then derive the predicted contamination from milky way foreground stars within this member sample .",
    "finally , we identify 5 stars that are probable interlopers and present the properties of the remaining 40 probable wil 1 member stars .      the first required criterion for wil 1 membership is having a color and magnitude consistent with the stellar population of wil 1 .",
    "we use a loose color - magnitude ( cm ) selection , as shown by boxes overplotted with dotted lines on figure  [ fig_cmd ] .",
    "we used this loose cut , rather than proximity to a fiducial cluster sequence , to avoid making a priori assumptions about the stellar population of wil 1 .",
    "58 of the 97 stars in our spectroscopic catalog satisfy these cm criteria .",
    "the second required criterion for wil 1 membership is a velocity consistent with belonging to wil 1 .",
    "figure  [ fig_vhist ] shows the heliocentric velocity histogram of these 58 stars , along with the velocity histogram of the 39 stars that do not satisfy the color - magnitude selection for wil 1 membership .",
    "the velocity distribution of the 58 cm selected stars is strongly peaked , with 45 stars between @xmath72 and 0 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "we identify these 45 color - magnitude - velocity ( cm - v ) selected stars as likely wil 1 members .",
    "this does not necessarily mean that none of the 13 cm selected stars with outlying velocities are physically associated with wil 1 . however , the spatial distribution of those 13 stars at outlying velocities is not clustered around the wil 1 center .",
    "we present in table 2 the equatorial coordinates , @xmath24 magnitudes , @xmath73 colors , heliocentric velocities , and spectral s / n of the 45 cm - v selected wil 1 member stars .",
    "we also include the cat w@xmath40 ( and uncertainty ) for the 15 possible red giant branch , as calculated in   [ ssec_feh ] .",
    "table 3 contains the same data ( but not w@xmath40 ) for the 52 non - member stars .",
    "figure  [ fig_colorcmd ] shows a cmd of the stars in our spectroscopic catalog .",
    "filled symbols represent the 45 candidate wil 1 members selected in   [ ssec_members ] , and open symbols represent the 52 foreground milky way stars .",
    "the number of open symbols overlapping with the filled symbols shows that shows that 40% of stars with colors and magnitudes consistent with the red giant branch of wil 1 are foreground stars belonging to the milky way .",
    "these foreground stars were only identified because their line - of - sight velocities were different than those of wil 1 stars . the median velocity of milky way stars passing the cm criterion for membership is @xmath74 km  s@xmath4(based on the besancon galaxy model ) , with 16% of these having @xmath75",
    "km  s@xmath4 .",
    "how many milky way interlopers remain in the cm - v sample of 45 candidate wil 1 members ?",
    "we simulate the number of interloper stars expected among the 45 candidate members using the besancon galaxy model .",
    "because photometric studies suggest the presence of tidal features around wil 1 @xcite , we first predict the number of milky way contaminant stars without assuming that all cm selected stars outside the wil 1 velocity peak belong to the milky way .",
    "we instead use the besancon model to predict the absolute number density of milky way stars satisfying the color - magnitude - velocity criteria for candidate members .",
    "the predicted number of contaminant stars thus rests on the assumptions that the velocity distribution of besancon model stars and the absolute numbers of stars in the besancon model are correct .",
    "we later verify that this yields a reasonable prediction .",
    "the primary ingredients in our calculation are :    1 .",
    "@xmath76 , the projected number density of milky way stars in the besancon model satisfying the cm - v criteria for wil 1 membership .",
    "we calculated @xmath76 and its dispersion in 1000 small fields randomly placed in a 1 square degree besancon simulation centered on the position of wil 1 . to do this",
    ", we shuffled the ras and decs of besancon model stars before selecting each random field .",
    "the random fields each had an area approximately equal to that of our spectroscopic survey footprint .",
    "because the cm cuts applied to our data were liberal , we simply used the model cfht - megacam @xmath23 and @xmath24 magnitudes as a proxy for the observed sdss @xmath23 and @xmath24 magnitudes .",
    "we convolved 4.7 km  s@xmath4  measurement uncertainties , the median for the 45 candidate members , to the model velocities of each besancon star .",
    "the average number of possible interlopers in the cm - v sample within a given area of sky , @xmath77 , is then @xmath78 .",
    "@xmath79 , the fraction of stars in our photometric catalog satisfying the cm criteria for wil 1 membership that also end up in our spectroscopic catalog of 97 stars .",
    "not all stars satisfying the cm criteria for membership were targeted , and not all targeted stars had spectra with high enough s",
    "/ n to be in the final spectroscopic catalog . to derive the true number of milky way interlopers",
    ", @xmath80 needs to be multiplied by @xmath79 . because both the density of stars and fraction of sky covered by observations decreases with increasing wil 1 distance , @xmath81 is a function of distance from the center of wil 1 .",
    "we thus calculate @xmath79 in each of three distance ranges : 0  2 r@xmath82 , 2  4 r@xmath82 and 4  6 r@xmath82 .    the contamination in the wil 1 candidate member sample is expected to be primarily composed of stars belonging to the milky way s thick disk and halo . because the relative number of thick disk and halo stars varies across the cmd ( thick disk stars dominate at brighter apparent magnitudes , halo stars at fainter ) and because these two galaxy components have different velocity distributions , @xmath83 is a function of apparent magnitude . because stars were prioritized by apparent magnitude in target selection , @xmath79 is also a function of apparent magnitude .",
    "we therefore separately estimate the foreground contamination in three subsets of the wil 1 population : i ) the five relatively bright red giant branch ( brgb ; @xmath27 @xmath67 19.5 mag ) , ii ) the 10 faint red giant branch ( frgb ; @xmath84 mag ) ; and iii ) the 30 main sequence ( ms ) and blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig_fg ] shows @xmath79 as a function of distance from wil 1 for the brgb , frgb , and ms / bhb subsamples .",
    "the overall target efficiency at all distances is much lower than one , because many stars at the faint end of our acceptable magnitude range ( @xmath27 = 23 ) for target selection were not measured with high enough s / n for a robust velocity to be extracted .",
    "many stars remain to be observed in the center of wil 1 if such faint magnitudes can be reached .",
    "the target efficiency for frgb stars remains high out to large distances from wil 1 , even though our fractional spatial coverage beyond 3@xmath13 is quite low .",
    "this is because our mask placement included two out of the six total stars between 4 and 6@xmath13 that are consistent with the frgb of wil 1 .",
    "although target efficiency is low at large @xmath85 , only 4% of stars are expected to lie beyond 3 elliptical half - light radii of a system well - described by an exponential profile ( see also   [ ssec_distrib ] ) .",
    "the average expected number of contaminant stars in each of the brgb , frgb , and ms / bhb cm - v subsamples in each annulus is :    @xmath86    and the average dispersion in this number is :    @xmath87    where @xmath88 is the area of each elliptical annulus , and @xmath79 , @xmath76 and @xmath89 are calculated separately for each of the brgb , frgb , and ms / bhb subpopulations .",
    "we predict a fraction of one interloper star within each of the three subpopulations within each of the three annuli .",
    "the probability that any individual star is an interloper increases with distance and is shown in the bottom left panel of figure  [ fig_fg ] .",
    "we sum the predicted average numbers ( and dispersions , in quadrature ) of interlopers in each annulus , to derive the average total numbers ( and dispersions ) of interloper stars expected in each of the brgb , frgb , and ms / bhb subsamples and find 1.5 @xmath6 1.0 , 0.7 @xmath6 0.5 , and 0.6 @xmath6 0.3 stars , respectively .",
    "although the number of stars in our sample increases at fainter apparent magnitudes , the number of expected contaminants is low in the 30 possible main - sequence members . this small predicted contamination results from the low overall target efficiency combined with the large number of wil 1 stars in its main sequence relative to its brgb and frgb . to convert these fractional numbers of stars into a physical number of stars that may be in our sample",
    ", we used the idl function poidev to generate @xmath90 poisson random deviates with the predicted mean and dispersion in the number of interloper stars .",
    "the result of this simulation is shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig_fg ] .",
    "50% of all trials contained one or zero predicted interlopers among the entire candidate sample of 45 stars - one red giant branch star .",

    "second , we want to drop the assumptions that the velocity distributions of stars in the extreme satellites are well described by gaussians and that stars follow undisturbed exponential profiles out to large distances .    another method frequently used to identify interlopers is the equivalent width of the na i line at 8190.5  .",

    "stars in the top panel of figure  [ fig_vdistr ] display an unusual kinematic distribution : central stars have velocities systematically offset from those of more distant member stars .",
    "the solid line shows the systemic velocity of wil 1 calculated in a running window of nine stars , not including those identified with high [ fe / h ] .",
    "the running @xmath177 rapidly decreases by @xmath10 8 km  s@xmath4  from the center to the outskirts of wil 1 .",
    "the dotted line of figure  [ fig_vdistr ] shows the same as the solid line , but including the likely interloper stars .",
    "this line shows that our result is not affected by our criterion for interloper identification .",
    "it is tempting to invoke a tidally - disrupting scenario may provide an explanation of this behavior in the systemic velocity , however this velocity distribution might not be easily explained by existing models of tidally stripped dwarf galaxies .",
    "for example , @xcite show that different viewing angles of a stripped dwarf galaxy are expected to reveal a symmetric velocity distribution of unbound stream stars .",
    "we note that the details of this systemic velocity profile depends on the center used for wil 1 and on the running window size .",
    "while we calculated wil 1 s center (  2.1 ) as accurately as we could and the window size used here was not fine tuned to produce this result , if our center is inaccurate or if we choose a larger running window , we may not see such a striking shift in systemic velocity with distance . given the relatively small kinematic sample from wil 1 and its extreme faintness it is difficult to conclusively interpret this systemic velocity variation .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig_vdistr ] shows that this unusual kinematic distribution is not obviously a result of ordered rotation .",
    "visually , a model with velocity that is a linear function of major axis position ( as expected for ordered rotation ) does not provide a good fit to these data .",
    "additionally , even if the system were rotating with a reasonable velocity , this signal would not be able to be discerned with such a small sample of discrete velocities @xcite .",
    "the variation in the systemic velocity with radius makes it difficult to robustly define the velocity dispersion of wil 1 .",
    "in fact we find the velocity dispersion profile of wil 1 to be highly dependent on the running window or binsize used to calculate the profile .",
    "we therefore choose not to show a dispersion profile here .",
    "we note for the 40 wil 1 members that i ) the velocity dispersion of the innermost 8 stars stars is equal to 0 km  s@xmath4 with an uncertainty of 2.1 km  s@xmath4  ; ii ) the velocity dispersion of the 9 stars with distances between 1.0 and 1.5 @xmath178 is also equal to 0 km  s@xmath4  , with an uncertainty of 2.5 km  s@xmath4  ; and iii ) the velocity dispersion of the outermost 9 or ten stars shown in figure 8 is equal to 0 km  s@xmath4  , with an uncertainty of 2.1 km  s@xmath4  .",
    "the details of this result is sensitive to the center used for wil 1 .",
    "we now explicitly address each of the assumptions necessary for using the kinematics to interpret a high mass - to - light ratio for wil 1 . while these assumptions may be reasonable for many of the milky way s companions , it is not yet clear that they are reasonable assumptions for wil 1 .",
    "* _ all 40 stars are physically associated with wil 1 _ + as stated in  3 , there may be a small number of milky way stars remaining in our sample of 40 likely wil 1 members , likely among its apparent ms members .",
    "the velocity dispersions of the milky way halo and thick disk are larger than that measured for wil 1 , so stars belonging to them may somewhat artificially inflate the global velocity dispersion measured for wil 1 .",
    "* _ all stars associated with wil 1 are bound and in dynamical equilibrium _ + our sample of 40 contains too few stars to robustly check whether the velocity distribution of stars in wil 1 is consistent with dynamical equilibrium .",
    "its unusual spatial and velocity distributions ( figure  [ fig_vdistr ] and discussed above ) , excess of spectroscopic members at large distance (  3.4 ) , and its relatively high [ fe / h ] for its luminosity (  5 ) may indicate that wil 1 is a disrupted or disrupting object .",
    "if this were the case then the assumption of dynamical equilibrium would not be valid .",
    "it is plausible that the 40 member stars reported here may contain some ( many ) unbound stars . *",
    "_ contribution to velocities from binary stars _",
    "+ given the small velocity dispersion that we have measured , and the fact that the measurement uncertainities are similar to the measured velocity dispersion , it is possible that binary stars may be inflating the global line - of - sight velocity dispersion measured for wil 1 stars .",
    "@xcite simulated the effect of binary stars observed velocity dispersions of dwarf spheroidal galaxies .",
    "they concluded that , while binaries do inflate the observed velocity dispersion of systems such as wil 1 , they are not expected to have inflated the velocity dispersion of a system with @xmath179 = 4 km / sec by more than 0.8 km / sec over its @xmath180 .",
    "alternative binary models have suggested that the observed dispersions of systems with intrinsic dispersions of only a few tenths of a km / sec could be even more affected by the presence of binaries ( a. mcconnachie , private communication ) .",
    "both modeling and repeated observations of individual wil 1 member stars would be necessary to definitively conclude the effect of binaries on its observed velocity dispersion . * _ symmetric velocity distribution _ + the distribution of line - of - sight velocities , relative to the mean velocity , is symmetric for any equilibrium galaxy model . while noting again that our sample size is too small to reach any statistically - robust conclusion , there are initial hints of asymmetry in the line - of - sight velocity distribution ( see fig",
    "if this asymmetric distribution persists with future data sets then it would support the hypothesis that wil 1 is not a dynamically equilibrated system .",
    "the deimos spectroscopic study presented here has revealed several new insights into the unusual wil 1 object and has underscored the importance of careful foreground characterization when studying the least luminous milky way companions .",
    "we have shown that the velocity , color , and magnitude overlap of wil 1 s stellar population with foreground milky way stars make this object particularly difficult to study .",
    "we thus performed detailed monte carlo simulations to calculate the possible foreground contamination .",
    "we used cat w@xmath40 plus color information to identify a total of 5 likely interloper stars out of the 45 possible spectroscopic members selected in  3.1 .",
    "the high interloper fraction we estimated for wil 1 s brightest candidate rgb member stars does not imply that wil 1 s true luminosity is less than that derived in past studies .",
    "photometric studies of ultra - faint dwarfs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) typically use a statistical definition of their luminosity rather than adding up the light emitted from individual stars .    in concert with the besancon galaxy model ,",
    "spectra from the segue database helped confirmed the similarity of two of the five flagged interloper stars to milky way stars with similar color , magnitude and velocity .",
    "segue spectra also provided strong support for the presence of two true bright red giant branch wil 1 members ( stars 1 and 2 in table 2 , discussed in  3.3.1 ) .",
    "segue may thus provide a valuable resource for future studies that aim to eliminate interloper stars from spectroscopic samples .",
    "the mean [ fe / h ] of wil 1 s three confirmed rgb members with log @xmath181 is @xmath52.1 , with a difference of 0.9 dex between the most metal - poor and metal - rich star .",
    "we found [ ca / fe]@xmath117 = @xmath182 , and [ ca / fe]@xmath118 = @xmath121 for the brightest two stars , with the more fe - rich star having the lower [ ca / fe ] .",
    "as discussed in   [ ssec_spread ] , we interpret the large [ fe / h ] difference between these stars to demonstrate that wil 1 is ( or once was ) a dwarf galaxy , rather than a star cluster . with @xmath183 for the brighter two of these rgb members , they are good targets for high - resolution spectroscopic follow - up to investigate their detailed abundance patterns . because star 2 was observed by @xcite , star 1 is the top priority for follow - up .",
    "the kinematic distribution of wil 1 is unlike the distribution yet seen in any of the milky way s satellites .",
    "its inner 9 spectroscopic member stars have radial velocities offset by 8 km  s@xmath4  from its 29 more distant members ( excludes the two members more distant than 3.5 @xmath13 ) .",
    "neither published models of tidally disturbed satellites nor ordered rotation provide an easy explanation for this distribution .",
    "we emphasize that the exact character of wil 1 s systemic velocity and velocity dispersion profile depends sensitively on the running window and the exact center used .",
    "we thus use this present dataset to highlight the unusual nature of wil 1 s kinematics rather than to present definitive conclusions .",
    "wil 1 s possible disturbed morphology and tentative excess of spectroscopic members at large distance relative to that of an undisturbed exponential distribution (   [ ssec_distrib ] ) suggests that it may have been stripped of a substantial fraction of its stellar component .",
    "some models of the tidal evolution of dark matter dominated satellites suggest that wil 1 should presently have a high m / l even if it has suffered substantial tidal evolution @xcite .",
    "however , because its dark mass content can not be well constrained given the reasons articulated above , appropriate caution must be taken when attempting to compare this object to the milky way s other satellites or attempting use it to constrain the particle nature of dark matter .",
    "if wil 1 has been severely stripped of stars and the line - of - sight velocities of its stars do not trace the underlying gravitational potential , then why does it happen to lie on the @xmath184 vs @xmath185 relationship observed for milky way dwarf satellites @xcite ? perhaps this is a coincidence , or perhaps the velocities of wil 1 s stars do actually trace its gravitational potential , despite its overall unusual kinematic distribution . only numerical models aimed specifically to reproduce wil 1 s properties may illuminate which answer is correct .",
    "searches for dwarfs that can reveal the presence ( or lack ) of willman 1-luminosity objects at a wide range of halo distances will be needed to know for certain the role of environment in shaping the luminosities of the tiniest milky way satellites .",

    "<S> wil 1 , also known as sdss j1049 + 5103 , is a nearby , ultra - low luminosity milky way companion . </S>",
    "<S> this object lies in a region of size - luminosity space ( @xmath0 mag , @xmath1 38 kpc , @xmath2 pc ) also occupied by the galactic satellites botes ii and segue 1 and 2 , but no other known old stellar system . </S>",
    "<S> we use kinematic and color - magnitude criteria to identify 45 stars as possible members of wil 1 . with a systemic velocity of @xmath3 km  s@xmath4 , wil 1 stars have velocities similar to those of foreground milky way stars . </S>",
    "<S> informed by monte - carlo simulations , we identify 5 of the 45 candidate member stars as likely foreground contaminants , with a small number possibly remaining at faint apparent magnitudes . </S>",
    "<S> these contaminants could have mimicked a large velocity dispersion and abundance spread in previous work . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm a significant spread in the abundances of the likely wil 1 red giant branch members ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath51.73 @xmath6 0.12 and @xmath52.65 @xmath6 0.12 , [ ca / fe ] = @xmath50.4 @xmath6 0.18 and @xmath70.13 @xmath6 0.28 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this spread supports the scenario that wil 1 is an ultra - low luminosity dwarf galaxy rather than a star cluster . </S>",
    "<S> wil 1 s innermost stars move with radial velocities offset by 8 km  s@xmath4  from its outer stars and have a velocity dispersion consistent with 0 km  s@xmath4  , suggesting that wil 1 may not be in dynamical equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> the combination of the foreground contamination and unusual kinematic distribution make it difficult to robustly determine the dark matter mass of wil 1 . as a result , x - ray or gamma - ray observations of wil 1 that attempt to constrain models of particle dark matter using an equilibrium mass model are strongly affected by the systematics in the observations presented here . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that , despite the unusual features in the wil 1 kinematic distribution , evidence indicates that this object is , or at least once was , a dwarf galaxy . </S>"
