    "the difference in e.g. the peak position of the curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : conc_fin]c indicates that the effects of diffusion and different photodestruction cross sections for different mixtures can not be neglected when making quantified predictions , however .",
    "in addition , the production dependencies of h@xmath0co , co and ch@xmath3cho are expected to be complicated by multiple formation pathways , all involving multiple dissociation events as shown in fig .",

    "the initial photoproduction rates of c@xmath0h@xmath4 , ch@xmath3oh and h@xmath0co are calculated from the abundance growth during the first @xmath20 photons @xmath15 when the growth is still roughly linear .",
    "table [ tab : prod_cs ] lists the resulting formation cross sections. these numbers do not represent physical photoproduction cross sections , since diffusion is required for their formation , it is however a convenient way of parameterizing their formation .",
    "the total formation cross section of complex molecules , in number of product molecules with respect to ch@xmath1 , increases somewhat with h@xmath0o concentration . when taking into account that some products require multiple chx fragments , an approximately constant fraction of the original ch@xmath1",
    "is incorporated into more complex molecules at all concentrations . furthermore , the ch@xmath1 photodestruction cross section increases with an order of magnitude , between pure ch@xmath1 and the 4:1 mixture and the formation efficiencies normalized to the photodestruction cross sections thus _ decrease _ significantly with h@xmath0o concentration .",
    "the presence of h@xmath0o then slows down the chemistry of the radicals in the ice , even though this effect is ` compensated for ' under laboratory time scales by the even more efficient slow - down of back reactions into ch@xmath1 .      during warm - up of the uv - irradiated ices , formation of new species together with sequential desorption change the ice mixture with temperature ( fig .",
    "[ fig : conc_quant_tpd ] ) . in the h@xmath0o - poor 1:3 mixture ch@xmath3oh is the only molecule that forms perceptively during warm - up , in the 2:1 mixture ch@xmath3cho is alone to form until reformation of the h@xmath0o - ice network around 130  k. the different formation patterns in the h@xmath0o - poor and h@xmath0o - rich ices suggest different diffusion environments .",
    "specifically , oh diffusion seems hindered in the h@xmath0o - rich ice , while hco can still diffuse and react with ch@xmath3 to form ch@xmath3cho .",
    "all species are partially trapped in the h@xmath0o ice , so that even c@xmath0h@xmath4 desorption is only complete around the h@xmath0o desorption temperature of @xmath2150  k      increasing the ice temperature should speed up the thermal diffusion of radicals in the ice and thus the ice chemistry .",
    "figure [ fig : temp_spec ] shows that the most notable changes in the irradiated ice spectra at 20 , 40 and 60  k are instead due to outgassing or a decreased production of volatile species , such as h@xmath0co and co , at the higher temperatures .",
    "the decreased production of these secondary and tertiary dissociation products can be understood if the intermediate radicals , e.g. hco diffuse fast enough at higher temperatures to react with another radical before absorbing a second photon and dissociating to co. this scenario is supported by an earlier onset in the ch@xmath3cho production at 60  k compared to 20  k ( fig . [ fig : temp_quant ] ) , and also consistent with the warm - up results that reveal hco diffusion above 30  k.    in contrast , there is no evidence for an increased formation efficiency of ch@xmath3oh and ch@xmath3ch@xmath0oh or for the formation of more complex molecules such as ( ch@xmath0oh)@xmath0 .",
    "rather the ch@xmath3oh production cross section decreases from 5.6 to 3.3 @xmath25 @xmath22 / n@xmath26 between 20 and 60  k. the lack of a positive temperature effect on the ch@xmath3oh production , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : temp_quant ] , suggests that ch@xmath3oh and ch@xmath3ch@xmath0oh formation depends mainly on ch@xmath3 diffusion that is efficient already at 20  k ; oh and ch@xmath0oh diffusion must be too slow , even at 60  k , in a h@xmath0o - dominated ice to affect their formation .",
    "in addition the decreasing cross section with temperature is probably due to thermal desorption of some of the produced ch@xmath3 at 60  k before it has time to react .",
    "to aid the interpretation of the experiments , we calculated the binding energies of radical - h@xmath0o complexes using the ccsd(t ) ( coupled cluster with single , double , and perturbative triple excitations ) method with the aug - cc - pvtz basis set @xcite . in order to correct for the basis set superposition error ( bsse ) the boys - bernardi counterpoise method @xcite",
    "the internal geometries of the interacting species were kept constant while a large number of different relative orientations and intermolecular distances were scanned .",
    "the thus located lowest energy minima were used to calculate the binding energies .",
    "the reported energies are electronic energies relative to the infinitely separated interaction partners .",
    "no account of zero - point energy was made .",
    "all calculations were performed using the gaussian 03 program package @xcite .",
    "the calculations were carried out for the predicted three most common radicals in the ice , oh , hco and ch@xmath3 .",
    "the resulting binding energies are 0.23 ev ( 2700  k ) for h@xmath0o - oh , 0.11 ev ( 1300  k ) for h@xmath0o : hco and 0.07 ev ( 800  k ) for h@xmath0o - ch@xmath3 .",
    "the h@xmath0o - oh result is in good agreement with other recent high - level calculations @xcite",
    "under laboratory conditions the most important effect of increasing the h@xmath0o concentration is to drive the chemistry away from c@xmath27h@xmath28 chains and toward products with a higher and higher concentration of oh . the same effect was noted by @xcite during proton bombardment of h@xmath0o : ch@xmath1 ice mixtures .",
    "this can be understood from simple rate equations where the production rates of various molecules are proportional to the production rates of ch@xmath3/ch@xmath0 and oh in the ice , i.e. the photodestruction cross sections of ch@xmath1 and h@xmath0o .",
    "the absolute values of these reaction rates also depend on the diffusion rates of radicals . if the destruction and diffusion rates had been constant , the relations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : conc_fin ] could have been used to derive the relative diffusion barriers directly .",
    "h@xmath0o does , however , change the ch@xmath1 photodestruction cross section .",
    "since this increased destruction efficiency is not accompanied by an equally large increase in production efficiencies of new molecules , h@xmath0o must slow down the overall diffusion of radicals in the ice to the point of trapping them .",
    "h is not expected to be trapped at 20  k , however , and the existence of larger radicals in the ice indicates that many of the h atoms formed during dissociation either escapes from the ice or react to form h@xmath0 . a significant amount of the produced heavier radicals , especially ch@xmath3 , must also remain mobile in or on top of the ice to account for the production of any complex molecules during irradiation at 20  k in the h@xmath0o - rich ices . without detailed modeling",
    "it is not possible to estimate the relative importances of surface and bulk diffusion for the chemistry .",
    "it is however unlikely that all radicals are trapped in the bulk of the ice at 20  k , since even in the most dilute mixtures @xmath220% of the dissociated ch@xmath1 molecules recombine to form more complex molecules .",
    "this corresponds to at least 8  ml of chemically active ice in a 40  ml thick ice and the ice would thus have to be very porous to explain all chemistry with diffusion on external and internal ( in large pores ) ice surfaces .",
    "it would also be strange if diffusion in h@xmath0o ices is fundamentally different compared to diffusion in ch@xmath3oh ices , where bulk diffusion is definitely required to explain the ice photochemistry results @xcite , considering the similar behavior of the two ices during segregation studies @xcite .",
    "trapping of some of the radicals in the ice bulk is however needed to explain that up to 80% of the dissociated ch@xmath1 is not converted into more complex molecules in the h@xmath0o : ch@xmath1 5:1 ices .",
    "this is consistent with the commonly observed trapping of molecules such as co and co@xmath0 in h@xmath0o - rich ices @xcite .",
    "it may also explain some earlier results ; trapping of ch@xmath3oh photofragments in the h@xmath0o : ch@xmath3oh 10:1 ice mixture in @xcite would prevent the radicals reacting with each other and thus favor dissociation into smaller and smaller fragments ( ch@xmath0oh , h@xmath0co , hco , co ) , explaining their result of high h@xmath0co and co yields in h@xmath0o - rich ices without invoking efficient h abstraction by oh radicals . when the ice is heated some of the bound radicals overcome their entrapment and react to form new species .",
    "in all h@xmath0o : ch@xmath1 ice mixtures the most abundant radicals are expected to be ch@xmath3 ( see below ) and oh , the two major photoproducts of ch@xmath1 and h@xmath0o .",
    "ch@xmath3oh is thus always expected to form more abundantly during warm - up of the irradiated ices than e.g. ch@xmath3cho , consistent with the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : conc_quant ] for the h@xmath0o : ch@xmath1 1:3 experiment . in the 2:1 mixture",
    "almost no ch@xmath3oh forms initially during warm - up , however .",
    "instead a significant amount of ch@xmath3cho forms , followed later by ch@xmath3oh formation during the h@xmath0o ice reformation temperature of @xmath2120130  k. an increasing h@xmath0o concentration thus increases the oh diffusion barrier relative to the hco diffusion barrier .",
    "this is physically reasonable since oh and h@xmath0o are expected to bond stronger than hco and h@xmath0o .",
    "the importance of the relative diffusion barriers of oh and hco to drive the chemistry demonstrates that radical - radical reactions in ice is only efficient when both radicals ( i.e. ch@xmath3+oh or ch@xmath3+hco ) taking part in the reaction are mobile .",
    "ch@xmath1 is known to dissociate into a number of different fragments during uv photolysis in the gas phase .",
    "the dissociation cross section is wavelength dependent , e.g. almost no ch@xmath0 is observed to form from dissociation with ly-@xmath11 photons @xcite even though it is expected to be an important channel at lower photon energies @xcite . by comparing the initial c@xmath0h@xmath4 and c@xmath0h@xmath1 formation efficiencies in pure uv - irradiated ch@xmath1 ice , it is possible to constrain the ch@xmath1 photodissociation branching ratio in ices irradiated with a hydrogen lamp output consisting of both ly-@xmath11 photons and broad - band emission .    in the pure ch@xmath1 ice the initial growth of both c@xmath0h@xmath4 and c@xmath0h@xmath1",
    "is assumed to be caused by ch@xmath3+ch@xmath3 and ch@xmath0+ch@xmath0 radical reactions , ignoring second generation photodissociation products . further assuming that the diffusion barriers of ch@xmath3 and ch@xmath0 are comparable , the ch@xmath1 branching ratio can be constrained from the initial c@xmath0h@xmath4 and c@xmath0h@xmath1 production rate , which is @xmath29:1 ; @xcite find a comparable c@xmath0h@xmath4/c@xmath0h@xmath1 product ratio ( 8:1 ) .",
    "since each reaction requires two radicals , the dissociation branching ratio is inferred to be ch@xmath3:ch@xmath0 @xmath293:1 .",
    "this is consistent with a chemistry driven largely by ly-@xmath11 photons .",
    "the diffusion barriers are more difficult to constrain directly from the experiment .",
    "the calculated bond strengths of 800 , 1300 and 2700  k for the h@xmath0o - ch@xmath3 , hco and -oh complexes are not identical to ice diffusion barriers , but the relative values should agree with the experimental results . indeed ,",
    "the data show that oh has a higher diffusion barrier than hco in h@xmath0o - dominated ices ( efficient thermal diffusion at 30 and 120  k respectively ) and that ch@xmath3 must be diffusing already at 20  k to explain any complex molecule production at this temperature .",
    "the calculated bond strengths are thus a good starting point for models , where the quantified formation rates of molecules can be used to extract diffusion barriers , similarly to what is currently being done for the ch@xmath3oh photochemistry ( garrod & berg in prep . ) .",
    "already both calculations and experiments suggest that the temperature window between diffusion and desorption in h@xmath0o - dominated ices is quite small for the investigated radicals , which may explain the low production yield of complex organics during warm - up ( a few % of all dissociated ch@xmath1 ) observed here compared to the efficient production of complex molecules observed during warm - up of irradiated ch@xmath3oh - ices @xcite .",
    "the calculations also show that predicting radical diffusion barriers from the bond strengths of the parent molecule to h@xmath0o can be quite reasonable @xcite ; the h@xmath0o - h@xmath0o , h@xmath0o - h@xmath0co and h@xmath0o - ch@xmath1 bond strengths are 0.2 , 0.07 - 0.13 and 0.03 ev , respectively ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is very similar to the bond strengths calculated for the h@xmath0o - radical complex interactions .",
    "there thus seems to be a direct dependence between the h@xmath0o - molecule and h@xmath0o - radical interactions .      as shown previously for pure and mixed ch@xmath3oh ices",
    ", uv irradiation of h@xmath0o : ch@xmath1 ices readily results in the production of complex molecules and this production can be quantified . after a uv fluence corresponding to @xmath30 years in a cloud core , up to 50% of the original ch@xmath1 and 25% of the nh@xmath3 ice",
    "have dissociated into radicals that can react into more complex species . at low temperatures most of these radicals",
    "are trapped in the ice , i.e. only @xmath210% of the original ch@xmath1 ice can be converted into complex molecules during uv irradiation at low temperatures .",
    "as the protostar turns on and heats the ice many of the trapped radicals will become mobile resulting in a second equally important formation step of complex molecules  this step will probably be more important in space than in the lab because of the lower heating rate in astrophysical environments . taking a typical ch@xmath1 ice abundance of @xmath24% with respect to h@xmath0o ice and a h@xmath0o ice abundance of @xmath210@xmath5 with respect to h@xmath0 toward protostars @xcite",
    ", this corresponds to a potential production of complex molecules of @xmath31 with respect to h@xmath0 .",
    "this is high enough to contribute significantly to typical hot core abundances of complex molecules @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "several of the ch@xmath3oh and h@xmath0o : ch@xmath1 photochemistry products are the same , e.g. ch@xmath3ch@xmath0oh and ch@xmath3cho , and the relative importance of the two production pathways during star formation will depend on the relative abundances of ch@xmath3oh and ch@xmath1 ice on the grains as well as what other ice constituents are mixed with h@xmath0o .",
    "both the h@xmath0o- and the co / ch@xmath3oh - rich ice phases must clearly be modeled to accurately predict the total formation rates of c- and o - containing complex molecules in space .",
    "in addition it is crucial to understand the effects of h@xmath0o quantitatively to constrain when and where n - containing complex molecules form  their main formation pathway is probably from nh@xmath3 in a h@xmath0o - rich ice . while the production of radicals seems to be the most important effect of h@xmath0o on the ice photochemistry under laboratory conditions , this is not necessarily the case for the time scales and ice compositions present at star and planet formation .",
    "rather detailed modeling is required that extracts the microscopic properties of the h@xmath0o - rich ice chemistry from the laboratory experiments , such as the composition - dependent diffusion barriers , and applies these results to astrochemical models .",
    "only when a simple system , such as h@xmath0o : ch@xmath1 , is understood at this detailed level can we expect to accurately model the more elusive nitrogen chemistry in h@xmath0o - rich environments and thus provide predictions of e.g. the prebiotic amino acid production .",
    "estimating ice life times is easier than predicting the chemical evolution , though the composition dependence of ch@xmath1 photodestruction introduces some uncertainty .",
    "table [ tab : ch4_life ] list the photodestruction time scales for 20 - 30  k ch@xmath1 ice in pure , 2:1 and 4:1 h@xmath0o : ch@xmath1 ices subject to a weak uv field induced by cosmic rays , the interstellar radiation field and the 1000 times higher uv flux inferred toward the l1527 outflow @xcite . outside of protected cloud cores",
    "the ch@xmath1 ice life time is thus short compared to most other time scales , especially in h@xmath0o - rich ice mixtures relevant for protostars . for large quantities of ch@xmath1 ice to survive to thermally desorb around protostars and drive warm - carbon - chain - chemistry as suggested by @xcite then requires that the ices are well protected up until that point .",
    "this may be a reason for the low number of observations of such a chemistry during the protostellar stage .",
    "the photodestruction cross section of nh@xmath3 and ch@xmath1 in h@xmath0o ice mixtures increases with h@xmath0o concentration by up to a factor of 10 with implications for the ch@xmath1 ice lifetime in protostellar envelopes .",
    "simultaneously the production efficiency of stable molecules in the h@xmath0o : ch@xmath1 ice increases by a factor of two .",
    "this is explained by trapping of radicals in the h@xmath0o - ice matrix , which prevents back reactions between e.g. ch@xmath3 and h. 2 .",
    "the h@xmath0o : ch@xmath1 photochemistry produces c@xmath0h@xmath4 , ch@xmath3oh and ch@xmath3ch@xmath0oh as a function of ch@xmath1 concentration , in a way that can be directly related to the number of oh and ch@xmath0/ch@xmath3 groups in each product .",
    "the production of ch@xmath3cho , h@xmath0co and co has a fluence delay consistent with formation through more steps compared to e.g. ch@xmath3oh .",
    "3 .   on laboratory time",
    "scales increasing the ice temperature from 20 to 60  k has a limited effect on the chemistry , probably because hco is the only important reactant that becomes mobile in this temperature interval in h@xmath0o - dominated ice mixtures .",
    "the ch@xmath1 photodissociation branching ratio into ch@xmath3 and ch@xmath0 is @xmath293:1 , as derived from the relative production efficiencies of c@xmath0h@xmath4 and c@xmath0h@xmath1 .",
    "oh diffusion is fast in the h@xmath0o : ch@xmath1 1:3 mixture , but not present in the h@xmath0o - dominated ice mixtures below 100  k. hco diffusion is possible above 30  k in the h@xmath0o - rich ice mixtures and ch@xmath3 diffusion seems efficient at 20  k in all mixtures , consistent with calculated h@xmath0o - radical complex bond strengths .",
    "oh diffusion is thus more severely slowed down with h@xmath0o concentration than the other radicals , which counteracts the higher oh production rate in h@xmath0o - richer ices .",
    "6 .   because h@xmath0o is both a source of oh radicals and preferentially trap oh compared to more volatile radicals , predicting the photoproduction branching ratio of different complex molecules in space requires microscopic modeling of the h@xmath0o : ch@xmath1 experiments rather than direct comparison with experiments .",
