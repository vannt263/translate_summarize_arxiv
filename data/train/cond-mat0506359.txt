    "the recent discovery that small molecules solvated in he clusters display a sharp rotational spectrum with well resolved lines is a spectacular manifestation of he superfluidity in such extreme confined conditions @xcite .",
    "recent developments in quantum many - body simulation techniques are allowing for the determination of the first few excited states of interacting boson systems @xcite , as well as for an understanding of the relations existing between structure , dynamics , and superfluidity in these systems @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has now become possible to _ predict _ the dependence of the effective molecular rotational constant , @xmath1 , on the cluster size , @xmath2 , for clusters up to a few tens of he atoms @xcite .",
    "results based on the so - called _ projection operator imaginary - time spectral evolution _ ( poitse , an implementation of diffusion quantum monte carlo aimed at estimating excitation energies ) provide the following scenario for the dependence of @xmath1 upon @xmath2 @xcite : _ i ) _ the inertia of heavy rotors is reduced by a factor 2 - 3 upon solvation , whereas the reduction is of the order of a few tens percent only in the case of light molecules ; _ ii ) _ the inertia of solvated heavy rotors ( such as , _",
    "e.g. _ , ocs or sf@xmath3 ) would reach the large - size ( nano - droplet ) regime well before the first solvation shell is completed , whereas the convergence for light rotors would be much slower .",
    "this scenario was partially rationalized using the concept of _ adiabatic following_. heavy molecules rotate slowly when excited and they usually have a stronger and more asymmetric interaction potential with the surrounding he atoms . as a result of the combination of these two effects ,",
    "a fraction of the he solvent density would be dragged along by the rotation of the molecule , thus contributing to increase its inertia .",
    "this effect would be greatly reduced in light rotors both because they rotate faster , and because their interaction with he atoms is usually more spherical .",
    "both these facts hinder the dragging of he atoms , in qualitative agreement with experiments which positively support the first of the above two findings .",
    "the fact that only a fraction of the he density in the first solvation shell would adiabatically follow the molecular rotation would explain the alleged fast convergence of the molecular inertia to the nano - droplet regime for heavy rotors @xcite .",
    "the alleged slow convergence for light rotors would instead be due to the interaction between molecular rotation and bulk - like collective excitations that is supposed to occur for large enough clusters @xcite .",
    "experimental results often exist only for large clusters .",
    "some results on small clusters begin to be available , but data in the intermediate regime are not yet sufficient to validate this picture .    in this paper",
    "this problem is re - addressed using _ reptation quantum monte carlo _ ( rqmc ) , a method that we believe to be the most appropriate existing to date to study the dynamical properties of interacting boson systems @xcite . as paradigmatic cases of heavy and light solvated molecular rotors we choose ocs@he@xmath4 and hcn@he@xmath4 , respectively . in order to disentangle the role of the bare molecular inertia from that of the potential anisotropy",
    ", we have performed computer experiments in which the rotational dynamics of ocs and hcn molecules was simulated using a fictitious inertia appropriate to the _ other _ molecule .",
    "these experiments indicate that the approach to the nano - droplet regime , as well as the reduction of the molecular inertia upon solvation , is determined by the anistropy of the potential , more than by the molecular weight .",

    "ii we briefly review our theoretical framework .",
    "iii.a contains our results for ocs@he@xmath4 which considerably extend the size range considered in a previous publication @xcite .",
    "we also address the problem of the accuracy of the molecule - he interaction potential @xcite and we show that avoiding the _ morphing _ procedure followed to brush up the potential , allows for a much better ( actually , almost perfect ) agreement between simulations and rotational spectroscopy experiments . in sec .",
    "iii.b we present results of similar simulations made for hcn@he@xmath4 . in sec .",
    "iii.c we present computer experiments done on molecules with _ fudged _ masses ( _ i.e. _ by using the inertia of one molecule and the interaction potential of the other ) , and we discuss the implications of these results on the main issue raised in the present paper ( _ i.e. _ the relative importance of the bare molecular inertia and of the anisotropy of the molecule - atom potential in determining the rotational properties of solvated molecules , as a function of the cluster size ) .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "iv contains our conclusions .",
    "we consider a realistic hamiltonian in which @xmath2 he atoms are treated as point particles interacting via a pair potential , and the dopant molecule ( either ocs or hcn ) as a rigid linear rotor , with only translational and rotational degrees of freedom .",
    "both the he - he and the he - molecule interactions are parametrized after accurate ab - initio quantum chemistry calculations @xcite . for the he - ocs potential energy surface ( pes ) ,",
    "in particular , we use the _ unmorphed _ version of ref .  .",
    "in the next section we show that this version  which results from a direct fit to quantum - chemistry calculations  is considerably more accurate for a wide range of cluster sizes @xcite than the _ morphed _ one which was refined so as to improve the predictions for the spectrum of the ocs@he@xmath5 complex @xcite .",
    "contour plots of the he - hcn and the he - ocs pes are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : pes ] , showing a much greater strength and anisotropy of the latter .     to negative values , and they are spaced by @xmath6 .",
    "the he - ocs interaction potential has a deep _ equatorial _ doughnut - shaped well around the c atom , and two secondary _ polar _ minima in correspondence of the o and s atoms , the one at the s pole being broader and deeper .",
    "the he - hcn interaction potential , instead , has a shallow main minimum in correspondence of the hydrogen molecular pole and an even shallower secondary one slightly below the equator on the nitrogen side , the latter being barely visible in the figure .",
    "[ fig : pes ] , width=302 ]    we simulate the system using the rqmc method @xcite .",
    "details of the calculations are similar to those of previous studies for ocs@he@xmath4 and co@he@xmath4 clusters @xcite .",
    "briefly , the imaginary - time evolution operator projects a state defined by a trial function @xmath7 onto @xmath8 , which in turn approaches the exact ground state , @xmath9 , as @xmath10 goes to infinity .",
    "expectation values on @xmath11 , @xmath12 , are computed using a discretized path - integral representation of the imaginary - time evolution , which becomes exact in the limit of zero time step .",
    "the resulting paths are sampled with an efficient generalized metropolis algorithm .",
    "the average @xmath13 of the values taken by the operator @xmath14 on the sampled paths gives an estimate of the desired expectation value within a known statistical error and without any mixed - estimate nor population - control biases . here",
    "@xmath15 can be either a static operator ( such as the hamiltonian itself or the atomic number density distribution ) or a time - dependent one ( such as those needed to calculate time - correlation functions : @xmath16 .",
    "a single path thus entails the imaginary - time evolution of the system for a total time @xmath17 , which in our simulations is typically between 1 and 2 inverse k , with a discretization time step , @xmath18 , of 10@xmath19 . by explicitly checking the convergence of the results to the limits of large projection time and zero time step , we make sure that the computed quantities accurately represent their ground state values .",

    "the choice of the radial functions is not critical , as soon as their variational parameters ensure sufficient flexibility in the relevant range of he - molecule distances .",
    "the resulting variational parameters , whose number is in the range of several tens , are optimized by minimizing the variational energy with the variational monte carlo method .",
    "information on the rotational excitations of the cluster can be obtained from the imaginary time autocorrelation functions @xcite : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the molecular orientation versor , and @xmath31 is the legendre polynomial of degree @xmath32 . a generic imaginary - time correlation function can be represented as a linear combination of exponentials , whose decay constants are the excitation energies of the system , and whose coefficients are the corresponding oscillator strengths .",
    "the usefulness of this representation for obtaining dynamical properties from quantum simulations is in general rather limited .",
    "this is so because the calculation of a spectrum from imaginary - time correlations entails carrying out an inverse laplace transform , a notoriously ill - conditioned problem @xcite . in the present case , however , the situation is not as bad because very few excited states contribute to @xmath33 .",
    "in fact , if the solvated molecule were isolated , only one rotational state would contribute to @xmath33 which would therefore have the form of a single exponential .",
    "furthermore , the interaction between the solvent matrix and the soluted molecule is rather weak , so that this single - exponential picture is only slightly perturbed .",
    "last , and most important , the bosonic nature of the quantum solvent determines a low density of low - energy excitations . as a consequence of the scarcity of low - lying excitations available to couple with the molecular rotation",
    ", it is thus possible to reliably extract their energies by a multi - exponential fit .",
    "a more general analysis , based on the maximum entropy method , gives equivalent results @xcite .",
    "carbonyl sulfide ( ocs ) appears to have a special role in the spectroscopy of he - solvated molecules .",
    "ocs was used as a microscopic rotor to probe the superfluidity of he nano - droplets in a celebrated _ microscopic andronikashvili experiment _ @xcite . as a consequence of the paucity of low - lying excitations in the bosonic host , molecular rotational lines are exceedingly sharp and well resolved when the molecule is solvated in @xmath34he , while they are broad and unresolved in @xmath35he . in the former case the rotational spectrum",
    "is well represented by a quasi - rigid free - rotor model : @xmath36 where @xmath1 is the effective rotational constant of the molecule",
    " renormalized by the interaction with the host to a value smaller but of the same order as in the gas phase  and @xmath37 is the rotational distortion constant which is several orders of magnitudes larger than for the free molecule .",
    "a few years later , size - resolved rotational and vibrational spectra of small ( @xmath38 ) ocs@he@xmath4 clusters appeared @xcite , indicating that fingerprints of superfluidity can be identified in clusters as small as @xmath39 .",
    "these findings spurred a burst of theoretical research aimed at elucidating the relations existing among structure , dynamics , and superfluidity in these small clusters @xcite .",
    "a semi - quantitative agreement between poitse results from diffusion quantum monte carlo simulations and experiments was reported in ref . in the size range",
    "@xmath38 ( a minimum in the rotational constant was predicted for @xmath40 , while experiments show a decrease up to the largest resolved size , @xmath39 ) , while for @xmath41 a fast convergence to the nano - droplet limit was observed ( full convergence was claimed to be achieved for @xmath42 ) .",

    "[ fig : ocs - he8 ] , width=302 ]    much of the discrepancy between the results of quantum monte carlo simulations and experiments ( as well as _ among _ different simulations , we should add ) may be due to the quality of the he - molecule potential utilized for the simulations @xcite . in ref .",

    "according to the analysis of ref . , the minimum in the effective inertia of the solvated ocs molecule occurs at the largest cluster size at which quantum tunneling between the main , _ equatorial _ , and the two secondary , _ polar _ , potential wells is hindered by the energy barriers which separate them .",
    "it is clear that the larger the barrier , the smaller the tunneling , and the larger the corresponding effective inertia will be . in ref .",
    "it was indeed found that fudging the ocs - he pes  so as to enhance the potential energy barrier which separates the main well from the molecular poles  hardly affects the rotational constant for @xmath47 , while it increases the inertia for @xmath48 , thus bringing the results of the simulations in much better agreement with experiments .",
    "it was later found that this too low a value for the relevant energy barriers is in fact an artifact of the _ morphing _ procedure adopted in ref .",
    ", so as to bring an already very accurate ocs - he potential obtained from coupled - cluster quantum - chemical calculations into an even better agreement with the known spectra of the ocs@he@xmath5 complex",
    ". such spectra depend on the details of the potential around the minimum more than on the height of the barriers which separate inequivalent minima .",
    "the latter , instead , are expected to crucially affect the properties of the cluster when the main potentials well starts to be filled by he atoms ( @xmath49 , in the present case ) .",
    "we conclude that the spectra of clusters with many he atoms  which depend on the pes far from the minimum  are a much more sensible benchmark of the quality of the pes than those of the helium - molecule dimer .",

    "our results compare favorably with experimental data which are available up to @xmath39 @xcite . in the small - size regime ( @xmath50 ) the rotational constant decreases with increasing cluster size because the he atoms trapped in the ( _ equatorial _ ) and in the first _ polar _ ( near oxygen ) well are dragged along by the molecular rotation , thus increasing the effective inertia . for @xmath53as",
    "the second _ polar _ ( near sulphur ) well starts to be filled  an increasing fraction of the he atoms can freely tunnel among different wells , thus not contributing to the molecular inertia .",
    "the quantum fluid nature of the he solvent is such that tunneling is a collective process in which not only the excess atoms not fitting in the main potential well take part , but even those which are tightly bound to it .",
    "for this reason , once tunneling among different wells is made possible by the spill - out of excess atoms , this process determines a decrease of the molecular inertia , _ i.e. _ an increase of the rotational constant for an increasing cluster size . as a matter of fact",
    ", it was shown in ref . that the value of the correlation between the molecular angular momentum and the atomic angular current  which is maximum in the main _ equatorial _ potential well  starts decreasing as the rotational constant increases past the minimum ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "this decrease continues until the first solvation shell is completed at a cluster size @xmath54 , around which the rotational constant seems to stabilize . as the second solvation shell starts to build",
    ", however , quantum exchange cycles involving atoms from this shell would contribute to further , although weakly , decrease the molecular inertia .",
    "a similar behavior of the evolution of the rotational constant for sizes shortly beyond completion of the first shell is also observed in simulations of clusters doped with n@xmath0o and co@xmath0 @xcite , which are all molecules having a qualitatively similar interaction with he atoms .",

    "this is also supported by experimental evidence @xcite : the measured value of @xmath1 for the largest cluster with secure assignment of spectral lines ( @xmath55 for n@xmath0o and @xmath56 for co@xmath0 ) is significantly higher than the nano - droplet limit , with no plausible signs of convergence within the first shell .",
    "a role of outer shells in bringing down the effective rotational constant is thus to be expected .",
    "how far from the molecule does this effect extend , our simulations  which are limited at present to a few tens atoms  cannot say yet .",
    "this finding is at least compatible with current phenomenological models of the inertia of he - solvated molecules , which predict a lower contribution of the solvent to the molecular inertia , with decreasing atomic density . in hydro - dynamical models a lower atomic density would determine a reduced kinetic energy of the irrotational flow of the solvent ; in a two - fluid model , instead , a lower inertia would simply follow from a reduction of the non - superfluid component of the atomic density .",
    "coming down from the nano - droplet regime , a decrease of the atomic density in the first solvation shell(s ) is indeed expected , as a consequence of the reduced pressure exerted by the outer shells .",
    "this is clearly demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : rad - rho ] in which the he radial density profiles around ocs are compared for @xmath42 and @xmath57 .",
    "the radial density in the first shell is significantly lower for the smaller cluster . on purely classical grounds ,",
    "a competing effect could arise if the spatial extension of the first shell was sensitive to the pressure release , thus affecting the second moments of the atomic density .",
    "the density profiles shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : rad - rho ] however suggest that this effect is small , since the positions of the peaks in the first shell hardly change between clusters of 20 and 50 he atoms .",
    "our results demonstrate that in ocs@he@xmath4 clusters the effective rotational constant does not attain its asymptotic limit upon completion of the first solvation shell , being in fact higher at this size .",
    "when the second shell starts to build up , the value of @xmath1 further increases ( arguably , via quantum exchange cycles involving particles of both shells @xcite ) . whether , in larger clusters , the missing inertia will be recovered by a change in the density of the first shell or by a direct contribution from the outer shells , or both , remains to be investigated .",

    "this has been demonstrated both experimentally , by comparing the rotational constants of hcn and dcn in the nano - droplet regime @xcite , and theoretically , by comparing the he density profiles obtained from simulations performed including and , in turn , neglecting the molecular degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the molecular rotational constant , b , in large droplets thus defies the application of either the two - fluid @xcite and hydrodynamic models @xcite , which both rely on _ adiabatic following _ , albeit in a different manner . on the other hand , direct calculation of rotational excitations by the poitse method @xcite indicated that the nano - droplet value would not be reached even for @xmath58 , well beyond completion of the first solvation shell .",
    "this slow convergence of the rotational constant as a function of the cluster size was later attributed to the coupling of molecular rotation to phonon - like excitations of the solvent which would develop only in the nano - droplet regime @xcite .",
    "unfortunately experimental data for the effective rotational constant of hcn are only available , so far , for very large droplets @xcite .",
    "we will see however how a comparison of our theoretical results for hch@he@xmath4 with both theoretical and experimental results which are available for the closely related co@he@xmath4 system will allow to draw a number of important and non trivial conclusions .    , for selected hcn@he@xmath4 clusters .",

    "( the latter being supported by the experimental study of ref .  ) suggest that for these _ light rotors _ the asymptotic value of the effective rotational constant is reached well before completion of the first solvation shell .",
    "we will see in the next section that this behavior is better attributed to the weak anisotropy of the potential , rather than to the small value of @xmath1 in gas phase .      in this section",
    "we consider the fractional reduction of the gas - phase rotational constant @xmath84 upon solvation in he nano - droplets , @xmath85 . the observed general trend ( see e.g. fig .  13 in ref .  )",
    "is that lighter rotors tend to have larger values of @xmath86 .",
    "a suitably defined _ amount of adiabatic following _",
    "@xcite has been proposed as the key physical property responsible for the value of @xmath86 .",
    "qualitatively , the analysis of ref .   supports the simple picture that both a small molecular inertia and a weakly anisotropic interaction lead to a large value for @xmath86 .",
    "however , there are several exceptions : for instance , n@xmath0o has @xmath87  k and @xmath88 , whereas ocs ( a _ typical entry _ in the mentioned general trend ) has @xmath89  k and @xmath90 . given that for ocs there is _ saturation _ to almost full _",
    "adiabatic following _ , @xcite the significantly smaller @xmath86 value for n@xmath0o can not be explained by resorting to the concept of _ adiabatic following _ alone .",
    "therefore , it seems useful to gain further insight by disentangling the role of the pes anisotropy from that of the gas  phase inertia . to this purpose",
    ", we have performed simulations with two fictitious molecules : f - ocs ( _ fudged _ ocs ) , with the pes as ocs and the same @xmath84 value as hcn , and f - hcn ( _ fudged _ hcn ) , featuring the hcn  he interaction and the @xmath84 value of ocs .",

    "however , at variance with hcn , the @xmath73-type line for large @xmath2 approaches an energy significantly smaller than the gas - phase value , @xmath91 . taking the value at @xmath92 as an estimate",
    "( very likely an overestimate , see section iii.a ) of the asymptotic value , we obtain @xmath93 , which is close to  and somewhat smaller than  the value of ocs .     as a function of the cluster size ( @xmath73-type , filled circles , and @xmath74-type , diamonds ) .",
    "the cross at @xmath75 shows the fictitious value of 2@xmath84 .",

    "[ fig : fakeocs - a ] , width=302 ]    .",
    "[ fig : fakeocs - rho8 ] , width=302 ]    the @xmath73-type line of f - ocs shows a minimum at @xmath40 or @xmath94 , i.e. at a smaller size than ocs . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fakeocs - rho8 ] already for @xmath39 there is a significant he density all around the molecule , which is presumably responsible for the turnaround of the @xmath1 value ( although the relation between density profiles and turnaround of the @xmath1 value could be not so straightforward for f - ocs , due to the residual spectral weight in the @xmath74-type line ) .",
    "regardless of the implications for the turnaround , we stress that the significant difference between the density profiles between f - ocs and ocs ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fakeocs - rho8 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : ocs - he8 ] for @xmath39 ) implies a significantly different _ amount of adiabatic following_. the fact that the @xmath86 values of f - ocs and ocs are nevertheless very similar , indicates that the anisotropy of the potential , rather than the dynamical regime implied by the gas - phase inertia , is mainly responsible for the renormalization of the rotational constant upon solvation .",
    "similar conclusions hold for f - hcn as well .",
    "the energy of the lowest rotational excitation with @xmath77 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fakehcn - rot ] as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "already for @xmath95 the spectral weight of this excitation exceeds 90 percent , and in this respect f - hcn is closer to ocs than to hcn ( i.e. the spectrum looks that of a linear rotor for @xmath96 ) .",
    "however as far as the value of @xmath86 is concerned , the effect of fudging the gas - phase inertia is very small .    in order to estimate the asymptotic limit of the rotational constant",
    ", we assume that it is given by the value at the largest - size cluster simulated ( @xmath58 ) , noting that the evolution of @xmath97 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fakehcn - rot ] is nearly flat for @xmath98 ( for hcn , this assumption would give a very good agreement with the experimental nano - droplet value , see fig .",
    "[ fig : rot - e ] ) .",
    "this gives @xmath99 for f - hcn , close to  and somewhat higher than  the value 0.81 measured in hcn @xcite .     as a function of the cluster size",
    "the cross at @xmath75 shows the fictitious value of 2@xmath84 .",
    "[ fig : fakehcn - rot ] , width=302 ]    our findings indicate that the potential alone has a dominant role in establishing the value of @xmath86 , at least in the range of physical parameters appropriate to the linear molecules studied here .",
    "furthermore , the effect of reducing the molecular inertia while keeping the pes fixed is to slightly _ decrease _ the @xmath86 value .",
    "this result , in agreement with an experimental study of hcn and dcn @xcite , contradicts the empirically established correspondence between light rotational inertia and large @xmath86 values .",
    "we conclude that such a correspondence is due , to a large extent , to the generally small anisotropy of the interaction between light rotors and helium  an accidental effect , as far as the rotational dynamics of the solvated molecule is concerned . within this picture ,",
    "the behavior of n@xmath0o is not an _ anomalous _ case , but merely a consequence of the stronger stiffness and anisotropy of the n@xmath0o - he potential with respect to , say , ocs or co@xmath0 .",
    "we finally note that a previous calculation for sf@xmath3 with a fictitiously small gas - phase inertia would support the opposite conclusion that , for given interaction with the solvent , a lighter molecule would have a larger value of @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "while this result could shed some doubts on the generality of the conclusions drawn from the analysis of a few _ linear _ molecules , we believe that the calculations of ref . probably deserve further analysis because they were obtained using a fixed - node approximation , whose accuracy is not warranted especially for light rotors @xcite .",
    "quantum monte carlo simulations , in conjunction with high - quality inter - particle potentials , have reached a remarkable degree of accuracy for the calculation of the rotational dynamics of molecules solvated in he . using the rqmc method ,",
    "we have studied the evolution of the rotational excitations with the number @xmath2 of solvent he atoms for a prototype heavy rotor , ocs , and a prototype light rotor , hcn ( for ocs , preliminary results have already been presented in ref .  ) .",
    "the size range explored , larger than presently attained with number - selective ir and/or mw spectroscopy , allows us to draw a series of conclusions on the approach of the rotational constant to its asymptotic value in the nano - droplet limit .",
    "our results entail a substantial revision , both quantitative and qualitative , of the common view that the asymptotic limit would be essentially determined by the amount of adiabatic following and that  at least for heavy rotors  it would be reached well before completion of the first solvation shell .",
    "the rotational constant of ocs , after the undershoot of the nano - droplet value and the turnaround which signals the onset of superfluidity , crosses again its asymptotic limit at @xmath55 ; moreover , starting with the beginning of the second solvation shell around @xmath100 , it develops a further structure with an extremely broad maximum , and a possible hint of a ( final ? ) decrease only seen at the largest size we studied , @xmath57 .",
    "this feature , which parallels similar findings for co@xmath0 and n@xmath0o , definitely supports _ slow _ convergence to the nano - droplet value .",
    "a strikingly different behavior is found for hcn . in this case , a linear - rotor - like spectrum is found for @xmath2 larger than 10 , and the resulting rotational constant stays constant in a wide range ( say 15 to 50 ) , with a value close to the measured value in the nano - droplet limit .",
    "this result contradicts the expectation of a slow convergence to the asymptotic limit ( determined by coupling of molecular rotation with well - developed bulk - like excitations of the solvent ) as a general property of light rotors .",
    "indeed , a behavior very similar to that illustrated here for hcn was found for another light rotor , namely co. it would be tempting to propose that _ fast _ convergence to the nano - droplet limit is a general rule for light rotors .",
    "however , preliminary experimental results @xcite seem to indicate that , for co , the asymptotic limit is significantly lower than inferred from the nearly constant value of the rotational constant in the size range from a dozen to a few tens he atoms .",
    "the possibility of defining a general trend for light rotors thus deserves further investigation .    in order to establish the relative importance of the bare molecular inertia and of the strength and anisotropy of the he - molecule interaction in determining the approach of the rotational dynamics to the nano - droplet regime , we have also performed computer experiments in which the molecular inertia was intentionally modified . to this end , we have considered two _ fudged _ molecular species , f - ocs and f - hcn , _",
    "i.e. _ ocs and hcn with fictitiously small and fictitiously large values of the gas - phase rotational constant , respectively ( appropriate in fact to the _ other _ molecule ) .",
    "perhaps the most important feature which was attributed to the predominant role of the bare molecular inertia is the amount of renormalization of the gas - phase rotational constant , @xmath1 , upon solvation : the strong ( weak ) reduction of @xmath1 observed for heavy ( light ) rotors was attributed to the large ( small ) amount of adiabatic following .",
    "our results indicate that the fractional reduction of the gas - phase rotational constant upon solvation is slightly _ stronger _ for f - ocs than for true ocs , despite the obvious fact that adiabatic following is much larger for the latter . likewise , the reduction calculated for f - hcn is somewhat _ weaker _ for f - hcn than for true hcn .",
    "the same trend was experimentally observed , with a smaller variation of @xmath84 , in a comparative study of hcn and dcn @xcite .",
    "this clearly shows that it is the strength and anisotropy of the he - molecule interaction , rather than the bare molecular inertia , which is mainly responsible for the renormalization of the rotational constant in the nano - droplet regime .",
    "in this perspective , the classification into heavy and light rotors thus retains its validity only to the extent that heavier molecules tend to have stronger and more anisotropic interactions with he .",
