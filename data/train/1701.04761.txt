    "in recent years it has been shown that the universe is accelerating in its expansion @xcite . in order to explain this",
    "one can introduce the concept of the cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "together with the inclusion of dark matter we get the @xmath4cdm model which explains a whole host of phenomena within the universe . @xcite .",
    "another approach to explaining this acceleration is to modify the gravitational theory itself with alternative theories of gravity an example of which is @xmath5-gravity @xcite .",
    "+   + @xmath1-gravity uses a `` teleparallel '' equivalent of gr ( tegr ) @xcite approach , in which instead of the torsion - less levi - civita connection , the weitzenbck connection is used , with the dynamical objects being four linearly independent vierbeins @xcite .",
    "the weitzenbck connection is curvature - free and describes the torsion of a manifold . in the current case",
    "we consider a pure tetrad @xcite , meaning that the torsion tensor is formed by a multiple of the tetrad and its first derivative only .",
    "the lagrangian density can be constructed from this torsion tensor under the assumption of invariance under general coordinate transformations , global lorentz transformations , and the parity operation @xcite .",
    "also the lagrangian density is second order in the torsion tensor @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath1-gravity generalises the above tegr formalism , making the gravitational lagrangian a function of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "+   + our study involves deriving a working model for the tov equation within a new modification of @xmath1 class gravity , namely @xmath0-gravity .",
    "there is no theoretical reason against couplings between the gravitational sector and the standard matter one @xcite .",
    "@xmath0-gravity takes inspiration from @xmath7-gravity @xcite where instead of having the ricci scalar coupled with the trace of the energy momentum tensor @xmath3 , one couples the torsion scalar @xmath6 with the trace of the matter energy - momentum tensor @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "+   + recently a modification to this theory has been propose , that of allowing for a general functional dependence on the energy momentum trace scalar , @xmath8 .",
    "+   + our interest is in studying the behaviour of spherically symmetric compact objects in this theory with a specific linear function being considered , namely @xmath9 where @xmath10 are arbitrary constants , and @xmath11 we take as the cosmological constant .",
    "we consider the linear modification since it is the natural first functional form to consider , and the right place to start to understand how the trace of the stress - energy tensor might effect @xmath12 gravity .",
    "in particular , our focus is on quark stars in @xmath12 gravity . besides the possibility of the existence of these exotic stars",
    ", this is also a good place to study the behavior of modified theories of gravity in terms of constraints .",
    "moreover , this also opens the door to considerations of stiff matter in early phase transitions @xcite .",
    "+   + the plan of this paper is as follows ; in section 2 we outline the theoretical background of the model . in section 3",
    "we consider the rotated tetrad and use this to derive the tov equation in @xmath0-gravity in section 4 .",
    "section 5 will then present the contrasting mass - radius relations derived using the mit bag model , which we derive numerically .",
    "finally in section 6 we discuss the results .",
    "the concept of @xmath0-gravity is a generalisation of @xmath1-gravity and thus based on the weitzenbock s geometry .",
    "we will follow a similar notation style as that given in @xcite . using : greek indices @xmath13 and capital latin indices @xmath14 over all general coordinate and inertial coordinate labels respectively .",
    "while lower case latin indices i.e. @xmath15 and @xmath16 cover spatial and tangent space coordinates 1 , 2 , 3 , respectively @xcite .",
    "+   + the non - vanishing torsion @xcite is given by + @xmath17 in tegr one uses the teleparallel spin connection , which by construction gives vanishing curvature , thus all the information of the gravitational field is embedded in the torsion tensor , while the gravitational lagrangian is the torsion scalar @xcite .",
    "the contorsion tensor is then defined as    @xmath18    while the superpotential of teleparallel gravity is defined by @xcite    @xmath19    the torsion scalar @xcite is then given as    @xmath20    as in the analogous @xmath21 theories @xcite , the gravitational lagrangian is generalized to @xmath12 giving @xcite    @xmath22,\\ ] ]    where @xmath23 and is the trace of the energy - momentum tensor while @xmath24 is the matter lagrangian density @xcite . in this instance @xmath25",
    "is an arbitrary function of the torsion scalar @xmath6 and the trace of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the variation of the action defined in eq.([action ] ) with respect to the tetrad leads to the field equations    @xmath26    where @xmath27 , and @xmath28 in our case we take the spin connection as @xmath29 from the start @xcite .",
    "we take a spherically symmetric metric for our system which has a diagonal structure @xcite    @xmath30    and consider the fluid inside the star to be that of a perfect fluid which yields a diagonal energy - momentum tensor of    @xmath31    where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the energy density and pressure of the fluid respectively and the time dependence will be suppressed for brevity @xcite .",
    "these also make up the matter functions which , along with the metric functions , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , are also taken to be independent of time .",
    "thus the system is taken to be in equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the equation of conservation of energy is given by    @xmath36    as is in @xcite we use the following rotated tetrad    @xmath37    we take this form of vierbein because it gives us more degrees of freedom @xcite and it allows us to obtain a static and spherically symmetric wormhole solution in our standard formulation of @xmath0-gravity @xcite .",
    "+   + moreover , this particular form of the tetrad is what s called a pure tetrad @xcite .",
    "this means that the spin connection elements of this tetrad vanish and the ensuing field equations do not need to consider spin connection terms @xcite .",
    "+   + inserting this vierbein into the field equations , from eq.([torsion_scalar_def ] ) we get the resulting torsion scalar    @xmath38    where the prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath39 .",
    "the @xmath0 field equations result in five independent relations    @xmath40    @xmath41    for the only non - vanishing non - diagonal element @xmath42",
    "@xmath43    together these equations govern the behaviour of the compact star .",
    "we take @xmath44 as our lagrangian function where @xmath45 @xcite . consider eq.([equation11 ] ) , and solving for @xmath46 we find    @xmath47    substituting this into eq.([equation00 ] ) and reducing yields    @xmath48    we invoke the density equation for an inhomogeneous body @xmath49 we invoke the mit bag model @xcite since it represents the eos of quark stars    @xmath50    we thus get    @xmath51    where @xmath52 and @xmath53 . substituting this into eq.([adash ] ) and then invoking the conservation eq.([conservation ] ) we get a relation between pressure , @xmath33 , and radius , @xmath39 , in this form    @xmath54    the mass - radius relation is also derived @xcite , using our modified schwarzschild solution found in eq.([modifedschawz ] ) and we get the following result    @xmath55    taking @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 we recover the gr tov equations .",
    "in order to obtain a graphical relations of the tov equations , we numerically integrate our derived tov equations of the mit bag model to this @xmath12-gravity model for quark stars .",
    "+   + we use the mit bag model because it is the simplest equation of state for quark matter @xcite .",
    "this is obtained because a quark star is a self - gravitating system consisting of deconfined @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 quarks and electrons @xcite .",
    "these deconfined quarks are the fundamental elements of the colour superconductor system @xcite . in the comparison with the standard hadron matter , they lead to a softer equation of state , the mit bag model which is given in eq .",
    "( [ mitbag ] ) .",
    "+   + the value of @xmath62 in eq.([mitbag ] ) is dependent on the mass @xmath63 of the strange quark @xcite . in the case of radiation , we have @xmath64 and the parameter is @xmath65 @xcite . in the case of a more relativistic model having @xmath66 mev ,",
    "the parameter would be @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath68 lies within the intervals @xmath69 which has units mev/@xmath70 @xcite .      in fig.([figmr ] ) we show the mass profile curve of a quark star by setting the values of @xmath71 , @xmath72 ( cosmological constant ) @xcite then varying the value of @xmath73 .",
    "+   + we take three values of @xmath73 in this case to contrast between the gr case where @xmath57 , the case where the function for @xmath45 @xcite is included i.e. @xmath74 .",
    "finally we include the case where this function is magnified by including @xmath75 so as to see the behaviour at various levels . +   + as we decrease the value of @xmath73 we allow for a smaller quark star structure . with the inclusion of the @xmath76 element",
    "some variations to arise .",
    "the quark star s maximum mass has however increased showing that having @xmath73 at lower orders of magnitude allows for a much denser quark star structure .",
    "+   + to show these variations properly we plot the curve for @xmath75 in fig.([figmr ] ) .",
    "here we note that for @xmath75 a more massive quark star is allowed in such a gravity framework however smaller in size .",
    "showing three different variations of @xmath73 .",

    "again we contrast with the gr case when taking @xmath57 .",
    "when we decrease the value of @xmath73 we may note that the central density figure of the quark star is more reluctant to drop however when reaching a certain radius it then decreases at a more rapid rate .",
    "+   + to further magnify this effect we again plot the results which are given by taking @xmath75 .",
    "in contrast to the gr case we see that the curve allows for a slightly denser quark star at a certain radius",
    ".     showing three different variations of @xmath73 . the value of @xmath67 and @xmath77",
    "in this study we study the tov equation and its derivative behaviour for the rotated , pure , spherically symmetric tetrad .",
    "we then contrasted this result to the gr case .",
    "our model has responded well when the mit bag model is considered . +   + our main goal throughout this work was to keep our terms as general as possible , with the possibility to revert back to the gr case whenever we needed to .",
    "this fact was very useful in checking our results throughout the derivation .",
    "+   + numerical techniques were required to solve the tov equation where reasonable boundary conditions were used .",
    "we apply an equation of state so that we may eliminate one of the four variables i.e. make one of the variables dependent on another variable .",
    "+   + for future work we hope to be able to apply a lagrangian which is not linear however thus far we have been unable to yield working tov equations .",
