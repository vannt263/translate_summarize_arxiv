    "the amount of recent work illustrates the importance of this issue . in terms of the vertical boundaries imposed on the temperature , including a transition into an optically - thin disk corona will be important .",
    "then a radiative boundary condition consistent with black - body radiation can be applied . to conclude , we want to emphasize that , clearly , the presented simulations can only be regarded as a first step towards a realistic treatment of the disk thermodynamics .",
