    "the `` monolithic collapse '' versus `` satellite accretion '' debate surrounding galaxy formation is a classic one .",
    "the former was best expressed by eggen , lynden - bell & sandage ( 1962 , els ) ; supporting evidence for the els picture came from the apparent correlation between eccentricity ( @xmath0 ) and metallicity of halo stars .",
    "in contrast , by using a large and reliable set of data for halo objects chosen without kinematic bias , chiba & beers ( 2000 , cb00 ) found no strong correlation between @xmath0 and metallicity .",
    "bekki & chiba ( 2000 ) showed that this lack of correlation is naturally explained by hierarchical clustering scenarios of galaxy formation .",
    "cb00 did , however , identify a concentration of stars of @xmath0 @xmath1 and [ fe / h ] @xmath2 , and suggested that this population of stars formed from infalling gas during an early stage of galaxy formation , in a manner similar to an els collapse .",
    "current cosmological theories of structure formation have more in common with accretion - style scenarios , such as that envisioned by searle & zinn ( 1978 ) .",
    "evidence in support of satellite accretion during our galaxy s formation can be found in the observations of considerable substructure in the halo ( e.g. ibata , gilmore & irwin 1994 ; majewski , munn & hawley 1996 ; helmi et  al . 1999 ; cb00 ) .",
    "helmi & white ( 1999 , hw99 ) noted that satellites disrupted several billions years ago will not retain the spatial correlations required to allow identification .",
    "however , they showed that the trail of stars left by a disrupted dwarf satellite will retain strong correlations in velocity space .",
    "further , the integrals of motion ( e , l , l@xmath3 ) are conserved quantities , and should evolve only slightly within the relatively stable potential of a galaxy after its halo is virialized .",
    "this space of adiabatic invariants is a natural space to search for signatures of an accretion event ( e.g. helmi & de  zeeuw 2000 , hz00 ) .",
    "we were motivated to run a grid of chemodynamical simulations with the intention of contrasting the effects of the two collapse scenarios on the evolution of the milky way .",
    "the two models described here vary primarily in their degree of clustering , and we examine the properties of the resulting simulated galaxies , in order to uncover present - day `` signatures '' of the models initial conditions and evolution .    details of our code and the models used in this study are provided in section  2 .",
    "section  3 presents the evolution and clustering histories of the simulated galaxies .",
    "we focus on the @xmath0 distribution of our simulated galaxies halo stars , and on the comparison to observations . tracing the evolution of stars originating in recently accreted satellite galaxies",
    "provides a clue to the source of high-@xmath0 halo stars .",
    "we next show that such stars occupy restricted regions of phase space , a signature of common ancestry .",
    "similar analysis of the cb00 dataset shows that the identified `` clump '' of high-@xmath0 , low - metallicity , halo stars occupies a similar restricted region of phase space . the implications for theories of galaxy formation and their observational signatures are discussed in section  4 .",
    "our galactic chemodynamical code ( gcd+ ) models self - consistently the effects of gravity , gas dynamics , radiative cooling , and star formation .",
    "type  ia and type  ii supernova feedback is included , and the instantaneous chemical recycling approximation is relaxed .",
    "details of gcd+ can be found in kawata & gibson ( 2003 ) .",
    "the semi - cosmological version of gcd+ used here is based upon the galaxy formation model of katz & gunn ( 1991 ) .",
    "the initial condition is an isolated sphere of dark matter and gas , onto which small scale density fluctuations are superimposed , parameterized by @xmath4 .",
    "these perturbations are the seeds for local collapse and subsequent star formation .",
    "solid - body rotation corresponding to a spin parameter @xmath5 is imparted to the initial sphere . for the flat cdm model described here ,",
    "the relevant parameters include @xmath6 , @xmath7 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 , total mass ( @xmath9  m@xmath10 ) , baryon fraction ( @xmath11 ) , and spin parameter ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "we employed 38911 dark matter and 38911 gas / star particles , making the resolution of this study comparable to other recent studies of disk galaxy formation ( e.g. abadi et  al . 2003 ) .",
    "the two models described here differ only in the value of @xmath4 . in model  1 ( m1 ) ,",
    "@xmath13 , as favoured in standard cdm",
    "( @xmath6 ) cosmology . in model  2 ( m2 )",
    ", we explore the use of a smaller value for @xmath4 of 0.04 , a value which results in a more rapid , dissipative , collapse .",
    "figure  1 illustrates the evolutionary histories of the two models .",
    "m1 demonstrates classical hierarchical clustering - gas collapses into the local dense regions seeded by the initial small - scale perturbation , with star formation occurring subsequently in these over - dense regions .",
    "stars continue to form in sub - clumps , as well as in the central region as a disk galaxy is built up .",
    "we see less clumping in m2 , with gas streaming homogeneously toward the centre of the galactic potential , resulting in most of the star formation occurring in the central regions .",
    "we analysed the bulk properties of our simulation at @xmath14 and confirmed that they were consistent with the simulations of katz ( 1992 ) , steinmetz & muller ( 1995 ) , berczik ( 1999 ) , and bekki & chiba ( 2001 ) .",
    "the predicted surface density profiles , metallicity gradients , specific angular momenta of gas and stars , and rotation curves for our models did not differ significantly from previous studies , or between our own two models .",
    "we suffer from the same overcooling problem encountered in earlier studies ( white & frenk 1991 ) .",
    "this results in too high rates of star production at early epochs , overly rapid metal enrichment , and a halo metallicity distribution function peaked approximately one dex higher than that observed ( ryan & norris 1991 ) .",
    "the field of mdfs is the subject of a future , lengthier , analysis , but we do note that this offset in the halo mdf peak does not impact on our analysis here ( we can still adopt a differential metallicity cut to delineate between the halo and thin disk in our simulation ) .",
    "we did find a difference in the orbital @xmath0 distribution of the simulated solar neighbourhood halo stars of the two models .",
    "after bekki & chiba ( 2000 ) , individual stellar eccentricities were calculated by allowing the orbits of star particles to evolve for @xmath15  gyrs under the gravitational potential of the simulated disk galaxy achieved at @xmath14 .",
    "eccentricities were then derived using @xmath16 , where @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) is the apogalactic ( perigalactic ) distance from the centre of the simulated galaxy .",
    "halo stars are defined to be simulated star particles with [ fe / h ] @xmath19 . due to the higher - than - expected absolute value for the halo mdf ( alluded to earlier )",
    ", this metallicity cut may lead to an underestimate of the halo population , but the final halo `` sample '' is representative .    the dotted ( dashed ) line of the histogram in figure  2a shows the @xmath0 distribution of halo star particles in the solar circle of m1 ( m2 ) . the solar circle is defined as an annulus of the galactic disk , bounded by @xmath20 r@xmath21 kpc and @xmath22 kpc , where @xmath23 is the rotation axis and r@xmath24 . each bin shows the fraction of such star particles lying in a given @xmath0 range .",
    "also shown ( solid line ) is the observational constraint from cb00 . m1",
    "produced a greater number of high-@xmath0 ( @xmath0 @xmath25 0.8 ) solar circle halo stars , and is in better agreement with observation .",
    "considering the analysis of els , whose rapid collapse model resulted in highly eccentric halo stars , it was not unreasonable to expect that the more dissipative , `` monolithic '' nature of the collapse of m2 would result in a higher number of high-@xmath0 halo stars .",
    "this prompted a more detailed examination of the collapse time of m2 . using analysis of the evolution of top hat overdensities with the collapse redshift @xmath26 , which we adopt ( padmanabhan 1993 )",
    ", the collapse timescale @xmath27 of m2 is estimated to be @xmath281.4 gyrs , thus not satisfying the conditions originally proposed by els , @xmath29 ( where @xmath30 is the star formation timescale ) . while encompasing the spirit of els within the current cosmological paradigm , m2",
    "should not be considered an exact analogue of the els rapid collapse scenario .",
    "as the difference between models  1 and 2 is in the clustering history , our result suggests that the milky way may have experienced significant clustering processes during its formation . to clarify this hypothesis",
    ", we examine the specific accretion history of each model , tracing the @xmath0 distribution functions for the stars associated with each disrupted satellite . in m1",
    "we identify two satellites at @xmath31 which have merged into the halo of the host galaxy by @xmath14 .",
    "these are the final significant merger events in the simulated galaxy s formation . the largest such dwarf galaxy ( hereafter s1 ) ,",
    "with stellar mass @xmath32  m@xmath10 , was on on a precessing polar orbit10% ) is reasonable , even if the _",
    "absolute _ mass is overestimated .",
    "this overestimation is an artifact of the overcooling problem alluded to earlier , and does not impact upon the phase - space conclusions described here . ] .",
    "by @xmath33 , tidal forces had begun stripping stars from s1 , and by @xmath14 , its stars were spread effectively throughout the halo .",
    "the histogram of figure  2b shows the @xmath0 distribution of solar circle halo stars which originated in the satellites identified at @xmath31 .",
    "the @xmath34-axis is normalised by the total number of solar circle halo stars in each @xmath0 bin .",
    "the dashed line is those stars from s1 .",
    "we notice that the majority of these halo stars are of high-@xmath0 , and that s1 in particular contributes @xmath2820% of all high-@xmath0 halo stars in the solar circle at @xmath14 .    in figure  3",
    "we plot the phase space distributions of solar circle stars of m1 .",
    "figures  3a - c show : velocity directed radially away from the galactic center v@xmath35 versus rotational velocity in the plane of the disk v@xmath36 ; velocity out of the plane v@xmath3 versus v@xmath36 ; and v@xmath35 versus v@xmath3 .",
    "figure  3d plots the integrals of motion , projected angular momentum l@xmath3 versus the absolute value of the energy ( @xmath37e@xmath37 ) .",
    "stars originating in s1 are marked as open circles .",
    "we see that such stars occupy a restricted region of phase space .",
    "it is worth noting that these results are qualitatively similar to those of hw99 and hz00 , both of which follow ( at higher spatial resolution ) the accretion of stars in a _ static _",
    "potential , in which little disruption to the adiabatic invariants would be expected .",
    "thus our study confirms that these results hold when the formation processes of the galaxy are self - consistently simulated , and hence the potential in which the satellite is disrupted is dynamic .",
    "in fact , our final velocity phase space distribution ( figure  3a - c ) is reminiscent of figure  5 of hw99 , bearing in mind that most of our stellar orbits will be at intermediate points between their pericenter and apocenter .",
    "further , the distribution of the disrupted stars in integrals of motion space ( figure  3d ) is in good qualitative agreement with those for satellites in figure  7 of hz00 .    motivated by the high-@xmath0 seen in the accreted satellite stars ( figure  2b ) , we examined the phase space distribution of the clump of high-@xmath0 metal - deficient halo stars identified by cb00 .",
    "figure  4 shows the sample of cb00 stars within @xmath38  kpc of the sun with [ fe / h ] @xmath39 , plotted in the same phase space projections as the simulated data in figure  3 .",
    "highlighted by open circles are stars with @xmath0 @xmath40 and @xmath41 [ fe / h ] @xmath42 .",
    "a wider range of energies is seen in the observed dataset , in comparison with the simulations shown in figure  3d .",
    "the latter indicate that recently accreted satellite stars will be of higher energy ( lower @xmath37e@xmath37 ) on average than halo field stars , as their stellar orbits will be less bound .",
    "we thus make an arbitrary cut in energy in order to separate the field stars from those we suspect come from an accreted satellite , and the new subset of stars are marked by solid circles .",
    "we notice immediately that these stars are more tightly confined in phase space , and closely resemble the distribution of the accreted satellite in our simulation .",
    "we have simulated self - consistently two models of the formation of a milky way - like galaxy using our n - body / sph chemodynamical code gcd+ .",
    "the models differ only in the amplitude of small scale density perturbations @xmath4 incorporated into the initial conditions .",
    "this results in different merging histories , which we then use to search for distinctive present - day chemical and kinematical signatures of the simulated galaxies early formation epochs . in m1 ,",
    "stars form in local dense regions of gas , seeded by a value of @xmath4 comparable to current cdm orthodoxy .",
    "the galaxy subsequently builds up via a series of mergers in the manner of standard hierarchical structure formation scenarios .",
    "a low value of @xmath4 in m2 resulted in a more dissipative collapse of the baryonic matter , with star formation occurring predominantly in the galaxy s central regions .",
    "both models result in disk galaxies with remarkably similar qualities ; m1 , however , produces a greater number of high - eccentricity halo stars , and in this regard is in better agreement with the observational dataset of cb00 . by tracing the merging histories of satellites in m1",
    ", it becomes apparent that a significant number of high-@xmath0 halo stars originated in accreted dwarf galaxies .",
    "in fact , almost 20% of high-@xmath0 halo stars located in the solar circle originated in one satellite , of stellar mass @xmath2810@xmath43  m@xmath10 , which was on a precessing polar orbit and was accreted over the past @xmath285  gyrs .",
    "thus our simulation suggests that stars from an accreted satellite which was on a polar orbit can form part of the galaxy s halo , and that such stars have highly eccentric orbits . originating in accreted polar satellites",
    ", these stars would not gain the angular momentum induced by the tidal torque of the external gravitational field which results in the rotation of the disk component of the galaxy .",
    "such stars will fall toward the centre of the galactic potential and end up on highly eccentric orbits .",
    "the existence of an apparent correlation between metallicity and @xmath0 in halo stars was taken by els to be a sign of a rapid collapse driving the formation of the galaxy .",
    "our study suggests that another way of creating such high-@xmath0 halo stars is through the recent accretion of polar orbit satellites .",
    "furthermore , dwarf galaxies of stellar mass @xmath32m@xmath44 typically have appropriate average metallicities to be the source of this group of stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath2 ( e.g. mateo 1998 ) . velocity phase space and the space of adiabatic invariants is where we would expect substructure within the halo due to past merging to be apparent .",
    "the distribution in such space of an accreted satellite of our simulated galaxy resembles that of previous studies which traced the disruption of dwarf galaxies in static potentials .",
    "the greater dispersion in the distributions of our simulation can most likely be attributed to the dynamic nature of the potential in our full simulation of galactic evolution , eroding the invariance of the integrals of motion .",
    "the identified concentration of high-@xmath0 , low - metallicity , halo stars from cb00 occupy a similar , restricted , region of phase space to the simulated accreted satellite .",
    "the suggestion that this concentration of stars in the @xmath0-metallicity plot is caused by satellite accretion has also been noted by dinescu ( 2002 ) . in the metallicity range @xmath45 [ fe / h ]",
    "@xmath46 of the cb00 data , dinescu notes an excess of stars in retrograde orbits with rotational velocity ( v@xmath36 ) @xmath47  km  s@xmath8 , from that expected from a `` pure '' halo .",
    "she identifies these stars as candidates for having been torn from the system that once contained @xmath48  cen .",
    "@xmath48  cen is believed to be the nucleus of a disrupted , accreted dwarf galaxy ( e.g. lee et  al . 1999 ) , is in a retrograde orbit , and has an orbital @xmath0 of @xmath280.67 . using a simple disruption model , dinescu showed that the tidal streams tend to have higher orbital @xmath0 than the disrupted satellite .",
    "along with the mean metallicity of @xmath48  cen being [ fe / h ] @xmath49 ,",
    "the inference is that the clump of high-@xmath0 halo stars identified in cb00 contains a significant number of stars which have been tidally stripped from @xmath48  cen .",
    "our simulations provide a degree of support for this hypothesis . taking those stars with l@xmath50 in figure  4d ,",
    "we see a clump of stars with intermediate energies and l@xmath51  kpc  km  s@xmath8 .",
    "these stars are identified in all phase space plots by grey circles ; we see that the distribution becomes more restricted in each velocity space dimension , and there is greater concorde with hw99 s idealized satellite accretion studies .    the key question we wish to address remains ... _ what are the implications for the competing galaxy formation paradigms ?",
    "a brief response is as follows : cb00 observationally found no correlation between eccentricity and metallicity for halo stars near the sun , obviating the need for a `` rapid collapse '' picture of galaxy formation .",
    "however , cb00 do interpret a clump of high - eccentricity low - metallicity stars in this observational plane in terms of els - i.e. as a relic of a rapid collapse phase .",
    "our simulations suggest that an equally plausible origin for this clump is the recent accretion of a polar orbit satellite in the galactic halo .",
