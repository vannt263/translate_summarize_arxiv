    "since the pioneering studies @xcite on diffractive vector meson production in ultra peripheral heavy ion collisions ( uphic ) about fourteen years ago , a large number of papers on the subject has been published considering several improvements in the theoretical description @xcite and experimental analysis @xcite .",
    "recent experimental results from cdf @xcite at tevatron , star @xcite and phenix @xcite at rhic and alice @xcite and lhcb @xcite at lhc have demonstrated that the study of photon - hadron interactions in these colliders is feasible and that the data can be used to constrain the description of the hadronic structure at high energies ( for reviews see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in particular ,",
    "the recent theoretical studies performed in refs . @xcite have demonstrated that the description of the alice and lhcb data using the collinear factorization formalism is strongly dependent on the choice of the parameterization of the gluon distribution and on the magnitude of the nuclear shadowing effects ( for a similar analysis using the @xmath1-factorization approach see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand , as originally proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the diffractive photoproduction of vector mesons in hadronic collisions can also be studied in the color dipole formalism @xcite and used to constrain the magnitude of the nonlinear effects which are predicted to be present at high parton densities by the qcd dynamics at high energies . in this formalism",
    "the predictions for the vector meson production in hadronic collisions are strongly dependent on the model used to calculate the forward dipole - target scattering amplitude @xmath2 .",
    "as the current color dipole predictions for the diffractive photoproduction of @xmath0 in hadronic collisions @xcite consider distinct models for this quantity , photon spectrum , skewness corrections and/or for the vector meson wavefunction , a direct comparison between its predictions is a hard task .",
    "our goal in this paper is to compare the predictions obtained considering different models for @xmath2 assuming a unified treatment for the photon spectrum and @xmath0 wavefunction .",
    "it allow us to estimate the theoretical uncertainty present in the current predictions in the literature .",
    "after showing that the different models used in our calculations are able to describe the @xmath3 hera data , we present predictions for the photonuclear @xmath0 production which could be probed in future electron - ion colliders @xcite .",
    "moreover , we compare our predictions for the diffractive photoproduction of @xmath0 in @xmath4 and @xmath5 collisions with recent lhcb and alice data , respectively . finally , we present predictions for future lhc energies and @xmath6 collisions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present a brief review of photon - hadron interactions in @xmath4 and @xmath5 collisions , as well as of the diffractive photoproduction of @xmath0 in the color dipole formalism .",
    "we also present the models for the dipole - target scattering amplitude used in our calculations . in section [ resultados ]",
    "we present our predictions for the diffractive photoproduction of @xmath0 in @xmath7 collisions and a comparison with the alice and lhcb data is also shown .",
    "finally , in section [ sumario ] we summarize our main conclusions .",
    "initially let us present a brief review of photon - hadron interactions in hadronic collisions .",
    "let us consider a hadron - hadron interaction at large impact parameter ( @xmath8 ) and at ultra relativistic energies . in this regime",
    "we expect the electromagnetic interaction to be dominant . in heavy ion colliders ,",
    "the heavy nuclei give rise to strong electromagnetic fields due to the coherent action of all protons in the nucleus . in a similar way",
    ", this kind of interaction also occurs in ultra relativistic protons in @xmath9 colliders .",
    "the photon stemming from the electromagnetic field of one of the two colliding hadrons can interact directly with the other hadron ( photon - hadron process ) .",
    "the total cross section for a given process can be factorized in terms of the equivalent flux of photons of the hadron projectile and the photon - target production cross section @xcite .",
    "the cross section for diffractive @xmath0 photoproduction in a hadron - hadron collision is given by , @xmath10 where @xmath11 represents a rapidity gap in the final state , @xmath12 is the photon energy in the collider frame , @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the lorentz boost of a single beam , @xmath15 is the equivalent photon flux , @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the c.m.s energy of the hadron - hadron system . considering the requirement that photoproduction is not accompanied by hadronic interaction ( ultra - peripheral collision ) an analytic approximation for the equivalent photon flux of a nuclei",

    "( [ fluxint ] ) will be used in our calculations of the diffractive photoproduction of @xmath0 in @xmath6 and @xmath5 collisions . on the other hand , for proton - proton collisions ,",
    "we assume that the photon spectrum of a relativistic proton is given by @xcite , @xmath21   \\left ( \\ln{\\omega } - \\frac{11}{6 } + \\frac{3}{\\omega }   - \\frac{3}{2 \\,\\omega^2 } + \\frac{1}{3 \\,\\omega^3 } \\right ) \\ ,",
    ", \\label{eq : photon_spectrum}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the notation @xmath22 $ ] and @xmath23 \\approx   ( \\omega/ \\gamma_l)^2 $ ] .",
    "the main input in our calculations is the diffractive photoproduction cross section @xmath24 . in what follows",
    "we describe the @xmath25 scattering in the dipole frame , in which most of the energy is carried by the hadron , while the photon has just enough energy to dissociate into a quark - antiquark pair before the scattering . in this representation",
    "the probing projectile fluctuates into a quark - antiquark pair ( a dipole ) with transverse separation @xmath26 long before the interaction , which then scatters off the hadron @xcite .",
    "initially , let us consider a photon - proton interaction ( @xmath27 ) . in the dipole picture",
    "the amplitude for the diffractive photoproduction of an exclusive final state , such as a @xmath0 , in a @xmath3 collision is given by ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath28.{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\delta$ } } }    \\,\\ , ( \\psi_{j/\\psi}^ * \\psi ) \\,\\,2 { \\cal{n}}_p(x,{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$}},{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ b$ } } ) \\label{sigmatot2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 denotes the overlap of the photon and @xmath0 transverse wave functions .",
    "the variable @xmath30 @xmath31 is the longitudinal momentum fractions of the quark ( antiquark ) , @xmath32 denotes the transverse momentum lost by the outgoing proton ( @xmath33 ) and @xmath34 is the bjorken variable .",
    "the variable @xmath35 is the transverse distance from the center of the target to the center of mass of the @xmath36 dipole and the factor in the exponential arises when one takes into account non - forward corrections to the wave functions @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath37 denotes the forward amplitude of the scattering of a dipole of size @xmath26 on the proton , which is directly related to the qcd dynamics ( see below ) .",
    "the total cross section for diffractive photoproduction of @xmath0 is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the ratio of real to imaginary parts of the scattering amplitude , which can be obtained using dispersion relations @xmath40 .",
    "moreover , @xmath41 is the skewness factor , which is associated to the fact that the gluons attached to the @xmath42 pair can carry different light - cone fractions @xmath34 , @xmath43 of the proton . in the limit that @xmath44 and at small @xmath45 and assuming that the gluon density has a power - law form , it is given by @xcite @xmath46}{\\partial\\ln(1/x)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite the estimate obtained using this approximation for @xmath41 is strongly dependent on the parton distribution used in the calculation .",
    "furthermore , the incorporation of the skewness correction at small-@xmath34 in the dipole models still is an open question .",
    "consequently , the factor @xmath41 as given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rg ] ) should be considered a phenomenological estimate .    if we assume that the nucleus scatters elastically ( coherent production ) and also that the scattering happens in the high energy regime ( large coherence length : @xmath47 ) the total photon - nucleus cross section is given by : @xcite @xmath48 ^ 2 \\label{totalcscoe}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the forward dipole - nucleus scattering amplitude . finally , the photon wave functions appearing in eq .",
    "( [ sigmatot2 ] ) are well known in literature @xcite . for the meson wave function ,",
    "we have considered the gauss - lc model @xcite which is a simplification of the dgkp wave functions @xcite .",
    "the motivation for this choice is its simplicity and the fact that , for the present purposes , the final results are not very sensitive these details . in photoproduction , this leads only to an uncertainty of a few percent in the overall normalization .",
    "the parameters of the meson wave function can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    the scattering amplitude @xmath50 contains all information about the target and the strong interaction physics . in the color glass condensate ( cgc )",
    "formalism @xcite , it encodes all the information about the non - linear and quantum effects in the hadron wave function .",
    "it can be obtained by solving an appropriate evolution equation in the rapidity @xmath51 , which in its simplest form is the balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) equation @xcite . in recent years",
    ", the running coupling corrections to bk evolution kernel were explicitly calculated @xcite , including the @xmath52 corrections to the kernel to all orders , and its solution studied in detail @xcite .",
    "basically , one has that the running of the coupling reduces the speed of the evolution to values compatible with experimental @xmath53 hera data @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the translational invariance approximation was assumed , which implies @xmath54 , with the normalization of the dipole cross section being fitted to data and two distinct initial conditions , inspired in the golec biernat - wusthoff ( gbw ) @xcite and mclerran - venugopalan ( mv ) @xcite models , were considered .",
    "the predictions resulted to be almost independent of the initial conditions and , besides , it was observed that it is impossible to describe the experimental data using only the linear limit of the bk equation , which is equivalent to the balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) equation @xcite . in what follows we use the solution obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite considering the mv initial condition , denoting the corresponding predictions by rcbk hereafter .",
    "it is important to emphasize that although a complete analytical solution of the bk equation is still lacking , its main properties are known : ( a ) for the interaction of a small dipole ( @xmath55 ) , @xmath56 , implying that this system is weakly interacting ; ( b ) for a large dipole ( @xmath57 ) , the system is strongly absorbed and therefore @xmath58 .",
    "the typical momentum scale , @xmath59 , is the so called saturation scale .",
    "this property is associated to the large density of saturated gluons in the hadron wave function . in the last years",
    ", several groups have constructed phenomenological models which satisfy the asymptotic behavior of the bk equation in order to fit the hera and rhic data ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) . for comparison , in what follows we will also use the gbw model @xcite , which assumes that @xmath60 with @xmath61 and @xmath62 , with the parameters @xmath63 and @xmath64 determined by the fit to the hera data .",
    "moreover , we also consider the b - cgc model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which improves the iancu - itakura - munier ( iim ) model @xcite with the inclusion of the impact parameter dependence in the dipole - proton scattering amplitude .",
    "following @xcite we have : @xmath65 with @xmath66 and @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the lo bfkl characteristic function . the coefficients @xmath69 and @xmath70 are determined uniquely from the condition that @xmath71 , and its derivative with respect to @xmath72 , are continuous at @xmath73 . in this model ,",
    "the proton saturation scale @xmath74 depends on the impact parameter : @xmath75^{\\frac{1}{2\\gamma_s}}. \\label{newqs}\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath76 was adjusted to give a good description of the @xmath45-dependence of exclusive @xmath77 photoproduction .",
    "the factors @xmath78 and @xmath79 were taken to be free . in this way a very good description of @xmath80 data was obtained .",
    "one of the parameter set which is going to be used here is the one presented in the second line of table ii of @xcite : @xmath81 , @xmath82 gev@xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "more recently , the parameters of this model have been updated in ref .",
    "@xcite ( considering the recently released high precision combined hera data ) , becoming @xmath87 , @xmath88 gev@xmath83 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 . in what follows we will use these two sets of parameters in our calculations , with the resulting predictions being denoted bcgc and bcgc new , respectively .    in order to estimate the diffractive photoproduction of @xmath0 in @xmath5 collisions we need to specify the forward dipole - nucleus scattering amplitude , @xmath92 .",
    "following @xcite we will use in our calculations the model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which describes the current experimental data on the nuclear structure function as well as includes the impact parameter dependence in the dipole nucleus cross section . in this model",
    "the forward dipole - nucleus amplitude is given by @xmath93 \\,\\",
    ", , \\label{enenuc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 is the dipole - proton cross section given by @xmath95 and @xmath96 is the nuclear profile function , which is obtained from a 3-parameter fermi distribution for the nuclear density normalized to @xmath69 .",
    "the above equation sums up all the multiple elastic rescattering diagrams of the @xmath97 pair and is justified for large coherence length , where the transverse separation @xmath26 of partons in the multiparton fock state of the photon becomes a conserved quantity , _",
    "i.e. _ the size of the pair @xmath26 becomes eigenvalue of the scattering matrix .",
    "in what follows we will compute @xmath98 considering the different models for the dipole - proton scattering amplitude discussed before .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we present our predictions for the rapidity distribution for the diffractive photoproduction of @xmath0 in @xmath5 collisions at ( a ) @xmath99 tev and ( b ) @xmath100 tev . in this case",
    "the cross sections are calculated in terms of the dipole - nucleus scattering amplitude given in eq .",
    "( [ enenuc ] ) . similarly to the @xmath4 case , we obtain that the distinct predictions largely differ at central rapidities , which is directly associated to the behavior observed in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) for @xmath101 collisions .",
    "we obtain that the bcgc new prediction is able to describe the current alice data @xcite , in contrast with the other predictions which overestimate the data for @xmath102 .",
    "in particular , the rcbk prediction is not able to describe the data , in agreement with the results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite . as observed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( b ) the difference between the predictions is amplified at larger energies . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we present our predictions for the rapidity distribution for the diffractive photoproduction of @xmath0 in @xmath6 collisions at @xmath103 tev . as expected , the rapidity distribution is asymmetric about midrapidity ( @xmath104 ) , being dominated by @xmath3 interactions , due to the @xmath105 enhancement present in the nuclear photon spectrum .",
    "we observe that the predictions differ by @xmath106 % at @xmath107 .",
    "finally , in table [ tab ] we present our predictions for the total cross section for the diffractive photoproduction of @xmath0 in @xmath4 , @xmath6 and @xmath5 collisions at lhc energies . as expected from our analysis of the rapidity distributions , the predictions for the total cross sections are largely distinct .",
    "the recent experimental data from rhic , tevatron and lhc have demonstrated that the study of photon - hadron interactions in hadron - hadron collisions in order to constrain the qcd dynamics at high energies is feasible .",
    "they have motivated the proposition of new observables which can be studied in these processes and the improvement its theoretical description .",
    "in particular , in the last year , several studies have been performed considering the collinear formalism and the dglap evolution , which demonstrated that the diffractive photoproduction of vector mesons can be used to constrain the behaviour of the gluon distribution at small-@xmath34 and/or the magnitude of the nuclear effects . however , at the high center - of - mass energies probed in @xmath25 interactions at lhc , new dynamics effects associated to nonlinear corrections to the qcd dynamics are expected to be present .",
    "these effects are easily included if the process is described in the color dipole formalism , with the cross section being strongly dependent on the model for the dipole - target scattering amplitude .",
    "this alternative approach has been used by several authors in the last years , considering different assumptions for the meson wave function and qcd dynamics , as well as for the free parameters .",
    "our goal in this paper was , using the color dipole formalism , to estimate the theoretical uncertainty associated to description of the qcd dynamics .",
    "we have assumed a unique model for the @xmath0 wave function and considered four models for the dipole - proton scattering amplitude .",
    "we demonstrated that although these models satisfactorily describe the hera data , their predictions are very distinct for the diffractive photoproduction of @xmath0 in @xmath7 collisions .",
    "in particular , our results point out that the recent alice and lhcb data are quite well described by the new version of the bcgc model .",
    "our main conclusion is that the color dipole formalism is able to describe these data and that future measurements can be useful to constrain the magnitude of the nonlinear effects in the qcd dynamics .     in @xmath6 collisions at @xmath103 tev .",
