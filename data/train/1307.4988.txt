    "the study of the primary mass composition of ultra - high - energy ( uhe ) cosmic rays ( cr ) is one of the topical problems of astroparticle physics because these experimental results are of crucial importance for understanding the theory of both cosmic - ray generation in their sources and their subsequent propagation to the earth .",
    "low uhecr intensity makes their study by direct methods impossible , so that the only available method is the study of extensive air showers ( eas ) .",
    "the dominant part of eas is caused by primary nuclei ( from protons to iron ) , however , there is a considerable interest to possible presence of very different particles , e.g.  uhe gamma rays , among them .",
    "first works on the subject appeared already a half - century ago ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) but definitive quantitative results are still missing ( cf .  a review @xcite and references therein ) . indeed",
    ", the highest - energy cosmic photons firmly detected had the energy of @xmath6  tev @xcite .",
    "the searches for gamma rays in the energy ranges @xmath7  ev@xmath8  ev ( the eas - top  @xcite , casa - mia  @xcite and kascade  @xcite experiments ) as well as at @xmath9  ev ( the haverah park @xcite , agasa @xcite , yakutsk @xcite , pierre auger @xcite and telescope array @xcite experiments ) did not find any signal and resulted in upper limits on the photon flux only . a few claims of the experimental detection of @xmath10  ev@xmath11  ev photons ( mt .  chacaltaya  @xcite , tien shan  @xcite , yakutsk  @xcite and lodz  @xcite ) had low statistical significance .",
    "at the same time , a certain flux of uhe photons is predicted in many models of both conventional and `` new '' physics .",
    "in particular , the flux of secondary photons from interactions of extreme - energy particles with cosmic background radiation , the so - called greizen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) photons , may serve as a tool to distinguish various models of cosmic rays at energies @xmath12  ev because the photon flux is very sensitive to the primary composition at these energies : predominantly light composition at gzk energies results in a much higher flux of secondary photons .",
    "given the present contradictory situation with the mass composition at uhe ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed review and ref .",
    "@xcite for a brief update ) , searches for gzk photons are now considered very important .",
    "also , a significant contribution to the uhe gamma - ray flux is predicted in particular top - down mechanisms of cr origin ( @xcite and references therein ) , in particle - physics models with lorentz - invariance violation @xcite and in models with axion - photon mixing @xcite .",
    "one of the most promising approaches to the search of primary gamma rays is the study of the eas muon component .",
    "the number of muons in a gamma - ray induced eas is an order of magnitude smaller than in a usual hadronic shower .",
    "therefore , one may hope to find photon showers by selecting those which have unusually low muon content .    in the present work",
    ", we study the muon content of showers with the estimated number of particles @xmath13 and zenith angles @xmath14 detected by the eas - msu array @xcite in 1982  1990 .",
    "we demonstrate that the number of muonless events exceeds significantly the background expected from random fluctuations in the development of showers caused by primary hadrons .",
    "this result may be interpreted as an indication to the presence of gamma rays in the primary cosmic radiation with energies of order @xmath15  ev which confirms and strengthens the first evidence for uhe cosmic photons @xcite .",

    "the description of the eas - msu array is given in  @xcite .",
    "the array had the area of 0.5  km@xmath16 and contained 77 charged particle density detectors ( consisted of the geiger - mueller counters ) for determination of the eas size @xmath17 employing the empirical lateral distribution function  @xcite and 30 scintillator detectors which measured particle arrival times necessary for determination of the eas arrival direction .",
    "in addition to the surface detectors which recorded mostly electron - photon component of an eas , the array included also four underground muon detectors , also consisted of geiger - mueller counters , located at the depth of 40  meters of water equivalent .",
    "these detectors recorded muons with energies above 10  gev .",
    "a muon detector with the area of 36.4  m@xmath18 was located at the center of the array while other three stations had the area of 18.2  m@xmath18 and were located at the distances between 150  m and 300  m from the center ( see fig .",

    "muon detectors ( circles ) are denoted by @xmath19 , @xmath20 ; surface detector stations are represented by squares . ]    to select the sample of showers with the number of particles @xmath13 which we use in this work , 22 scintillator detectors , each of the area of 0.5  m@xmath18 , were used .",
    "the scintillator detector threshold was set at the level of @xmath21 of a relativistic particle .",
    "the temporal resolution was @xmath22  ns .",
    "the 22 stations form 13 systems of 4-fold coincidences between counters located at the vertices of tetragons with sides between 150  m and 300  m which allowed one to select efficiently the showers on the full array area .",
    "the scintillator detectors were located at the same points as the geiger - mueller counters .",
    "the master criterion was determined by the firing , in the time gate of @xmath23s , of at least one of the 4-fold coincidence systems .    to reduce the number of sub - threshold events which still satisfy the master conditions , the express - analysis of the number of fired geiger - mueller counters",
    "was invoked . in each case , it was required that at least 4 of 22 counters in the selection system recorded the density exceeding 1 particle per square meter . with these selection criteria implemented , the probability of detection of a shower with @xmath24 falling to any place of the array was not less than 95% .",
    "the position of the shower axis was determined with the precision of @xmath25  m. the precision of determination of the arrival direction was @xmath26 .",
    "the number of particles in the shower was determined with the accuracy @xmath27 .",
    "the presence of muon detectors in the eas - msu array allows to search for primary gamma rays .",
    "the method is based on the fact that , for @xmath28 and for an hadronic primary , it is highly unprobable to have zero muons in the central , 36.4  m@xmath18 , detector if the shower axis is within @xmath29  m from it . at the same time , these muonless events are fully consistent with the conjecture of primary gamma rays .",
    "the total number of events with @xmath30 in the data set is 1679 ; of them 48 are muonless .",

    "]    presents the distribution of muonless events in the distance @xmath31 between the shower axis and the muon detector .",
    "most of the muonless events correspond naturally to large @xmath31 ; however , there are a certain number of events close to the axis which are very difficult to explain by random fluctuations of the hadronic background .",
    "one should note that the real number of muonless events is larger than observed because of the non - eas background which results in firing of each counter in the central muon detector with average frequency of 4.6  hz . in three other muon detectors ,",
    "the frequency of random firing was 2 to 3 times higher , and in this work , we use only the data of the central detector .",
    "it consisted of 1104 counters .",
    "for the time of eas detection @xmath32s , one expects 0.076 random firings .",
    "therefore we assume that the probability of absence of the random firing was 0.93 .    to obtain a very rough estimate of the probability to have a muonless hadronic event",
    ", one may start with the ( experimentally known ) mean muon lateral distribution function @xcite and estimate the expected muon density @xmath33 for a given core distance @xmath31 .",

    "the tail at low @xmath34 indicates that there might be a problem in explaining the observed number of muonless events within the standard model of the shower development .",
    "to quantify the observed discrepancy more precisely , we performed monte - carlo simulations of proton - induced showers and compared the number of muonless events in data and in simulations .      for the shower simulations , we used the aires v.  2.6.0 @xcite simulation code , whose choice was determined primarily by its speed .",

    "therefore , the central moment of the estimate is the calculation of the expected number of background muonless events from the simulated proton - induced showers .",

    "the probability @xmath43 to have @xmath44 muons in the detector of area @xmath45 located in the ring @xmath46 ( distance between @xmath31 and @xmath47 from the shower axis ) , is given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the function of the muon number density distribution in the ring as determined by the shower development and @xmath50 is the poisson probability to record exactly @xmath44 muons in a detector of the area @xmath45 for the total number @xmath51 of muons in the ring .",

    "see text for notations . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we shall note that , according to experimental data on eas development , all hadronic - interaction models currently in use underestimate the number of muons in a shower significantly .",
    "in particular , several independent indirect analyses of the pierre auger observatory data indicate  @xcite that the real number of muons is approximately 1.5 times larger than predicted by the qgsjet  ii-03 model . this number is used in table  [ tab : models ] and for the estimate of the systematic error",
    "; a similar result was obtained with the help of muon detectors of the yakutsk eas array  @xcite .",

    "* primary composition .",
    "* assumption of the purely proton composition gives a conservative ( i.e.large ) estimate of the expected background of the muonless events because primary heavier nuclei produce more muons in eas .",
    "for primary iron , the corresponding number of muons is larger by a factor of @xmath62 which shifts the expected background downwards to zero .",
    "this would change our fraction and flux estimates by @xmath63 .",
    "* large fluctuations . *",
    "since no model gives a perfect description of hadron - induced air showers , and in particular there are large uncertainties in predictions of muon number , one can not exclude that the fluctuations of the eas muon content might be much larger than suggested by simulations . among theoretical approaches ,",
    "the probability of occasional very low muon density in a proton shower is the highest in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite where the energy equipartition between positive , negative and neutral components of the cascade was postulated . as it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the frameworks of this model , it is possible to obtain the probability of @xmath64 of imitation of a gamma - ray shower by a primary proton .",
    "however , this model is much less physically motivated as compared to those which are currently used in simulation codes .    to summarize the discussion of systematic uncertainties , current experimental and theoretical understanding of the eas properties suggests that the flux values we obtain are conservative , though they could become lower if physically less motivated models were used for hadronic showers",
    "in this section , in order to find some hints about the origin of the events we observed , we perform various searches for deviations from isotropy in the distribution of arrival directions of the photon - like events .",
    "all the tests are performed by comparison , by means of a certain statistical procedure , of the real distribution of arrival directions with the simulated one which assumes isotropy . in all cases ,",
    "the result of a test is given by the probability @xmath65 that the actual distribution of events is a fluctuation of the isotropic distribution , that is for small @xmath65 , the isotropic distribution is excluded at the confidence level of @xmath66 . for tests of the global ( large - scale ) isotropy , we use the kolmogorov - smirnov method ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) which compares one - dimensional distributions of real and simulated events in some observable ( e.g. , a celestial coordinate ) . for searches of the local ( small - scale ) anisotropy , we rely on the correlation - function method which estimates how often the number of pair coincidences of directions from two catalogs ( e.g. , one of the arrival directions of cosmic rays and another of particular astronomical objects ) in simulated samples exceeds the similar number obtained from the real data .",
    "the notion of the `` pair coincidence '' depends on the angular distance @xmath67 between the directions , so the probability @xmath68 is often quoted for a certain range of @xmath67 .",

    "we consider separately those which do not require deviations from the standard particle - physics and astrophysical concepts ( we will call these scenarios conventional ) and those which require the presence of particles and/or interactions beyond the standard model of particle physics ( these will be called `` new - physics '' scenarios ) .",
    "note that high - energy photons interact with cosmic background radiation efficiently .",
    "assuming standard physics , the energy attenuation length for a @xmath72  ev photon is as low as @xmath73  kpc due to efficient @xmath74 pair production on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",

    "the secondary particles from all these interactions ( pions , electrons and positrons ) are the source of the so - called cosmogenic photons which appear either from subsequent pion decays or from inverse compton scattering of @xmath77 .",

    "@xcite ) ; the key point of interest here is the possibility to use these @xmath78  ev gamma rays as a tool to determine the composition of the bulk of @xmath76  ev cosmic rays ; due to the gzk process , the flux of the secondary photons would be much higher for super - gzk protons than for heavy nuclei .",
    "given the present - day uncertainty in the primary composition at the very end of the cr spectrum , see e.g.refs .",
    "@xcite , this approach attracts considerable attention , though no sign of the gzk photons have been observed yet .",
    "the expected flux of the gzk photons at @xmath79  ev is far too low to explain our result ; we are not aware of a calculation of the flux at lower energies , nor of the distribution of their arrival directions which however should be close to the isotropic one .",
    "uhe astrophysical accelerators are expected to emit energetic photons born in interactions of charged particles with ambient matter and radiation .",
    "the energy of accelerated particles should therefore exceed the energy of the photons , roughly by an order of magnitude .",
    "it is presently unknown whether the acceleration of particles up to @xmath80  ev may happen in any single object in the galaxy ( that is , within the propagation length of @xmath72  ev photons ) . in any case , these objects are not expected to be numerous ; we therefore expect a certain degree of clustering of the arrival directions of photons in this scenario .",
    "galactic tev gamma - ray sources may represent plausible candidates for the uhecr accelerators ; in this case , the arrival directions would concentrante around them .",
    "* `` new - physics '' scenarios . *    while the large hadron collider failed to discover easily any dark - matter candidate , models of dark matter which are beyond the reach of this machine are becoming more and more popular . in particular , the superheavy ( mass @xmath81  ev ) dark matter ( shdm ) scenario , originally put forward @xcite to explain the apparent excess of @xmath82  ev cosmic rays ( presently disfavoured ) , has its own cosmological motivation .",
    "its important prediction is a significant fraction of secondary photons among the decay products of these superheavy particles ; these energetic photons contribute to the uhecr flux . for @xmath83",
    "ev , the scenario is constrained , but not killed @xcite , by the uhe photon limits ; constraints for lower @xmath51 have not been studied .",
    "a characteristic manifestation of this mechanism is the galactic anisotropy @xcite of the arrival directions of photons related to a non - central position of the sun in the galaxy .    the uhecr data set with the best angular resolution ever achieved ( @xmath84 ) , that of _ high resolution fly s eye _ ( hires ) in the stereo mode , demonstrated hard - to - explain correlations of arrival directions of @xmath85  ev events with distant astrophysical sources , bl lac type objects @xcite , which suggest that @xmath86 of the cr flux at these energies are neutral particles arriving from these objects .",
    "the only self - consistent explanation of this phenomenon @xcite which does not require violation of the lorentz invariance suggests that the observed events are caused by the gamma rays which mix with hypothetical new light particles ( axion - like particles , alps ) in the cosmic magnetic fields . this would allow them to propagate freely through the cosmic photon background in the form of the inert alp and then to convert back to real photons in a region of the magnetic field close to the observer .",

    "secondly , there are other observables , not directly related to the muon number , which may distinguish photon showers from hadronic ones .",
    "one approach is to study the shower front curvature which is related to the depth of the maximal development of the electromagnetic cascade ; it has been used to search for primary photons in the experiments which do not have muon detectors , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "this method is particularly prospective for the eas - msu data because the array was dense and the number of detector stations which recorded a @xmath28 shower was typically large .",
    "the result we present may be tested with the muon data of the yakutsk eas array and in future experiments like fluorescence detectors of the telescope - array low - energy extension ( tale ) @xcite , muon detectors of the pierre auger observatory infill array ( amiga ) @xcite or cerenkov and muon detectors of the tunka - hiscore @xcite .",
    "the study of arrival directions of muonless events did not reveal any significant deviation from isotropy which might give a clue to their origin . in principle , this may change with the extension of the data set to an energy - limited sample ( versus @xmath70 limited one ) , which would increase the statistics for inclined events , together with more precise determination of the arrival directions and reduction of the background by means of two - parametric ( e.g.  both muon number and shower - front curvature ) selection of photon - like showers .",
    "we leave these questions for a future study .",
