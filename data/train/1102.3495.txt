    "reliability and efficiency are two fundamental aspects of wireless communication systems . due to the limitation on the available channel resources , improvement of either aspect",
    "comes at the price of sacrificing the other . to explore the optimal reliability when certain system efficiency is required ,",
    "numerous channel coding strategies have been studied in single antenna settings . for multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) fading channels , additional spatial dimension is utilized to combat deep fadings for reliability or increase the available degrees of freedom for spectral efficiency , namely spatial diversity and multiplexing . it has been proved that multiple antennas can provide lower error probability and/or higher data rate than conventional single antenna systems @xcite-@xcite . and",
    "the tradeoff between the error probability and the data rate can be asymptotically characterized by the tradeoff between the diversity order and the multiplexing gain in the high - power regime . fundamental diversity and multiplexing tradeoff",
    "is first characterized in the seminal work of zheng and tse @xcite , where an optimal maximum - likelihood ( ml ) scheme is utilized at the receiver for data processing .",
    "later , in @xcite , kumar _",
    "et al_. consider a low - complexity mimo architecture and discuss the dmt performance with suboptimal linear receivers .",
    "all these works focus on the dmt performance in point - to - point settings , but in practical cellular scenarios , due to the presence of inter - cell interference , how to characterize the dmt is still an open problem .    in this paper , we will extend the dmt analysis from point - to - point channels to cellular systems .",
    "joint spatial encoding@xmath0   and linear minimum mean square error ( mmse ) mimo transceiver architecture @xcite is utilized for practical complexity consideration . to evaluate the impact of the inter - cell interference on the system reliability and efficiency , inter - cell interference factor @xmath1 is introduced to asymptotically represent the inter - cell interference intensity . and the fundamental tradeoff among diversity order @xmath2 , multiplexing gain @xmath3 and inter - cell interference factor @xmath1 is characterized .",
    "given @xmath4 transmit antennas and @xmath5 receive antennas ( @xmath6 ) , our main result shows that the optimal dmt in cellular systems is @xmath7 , where @xmath8 denotes @xmath9 .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . the system model and definitions",
    "are described in section  .",
    "our main result on the optimal tradeoff among diversity order , multiplexing gain and inter - cell interference intensity is derived in section  . in section  ,",
    "numerical results and interpretations are presented to provide insights on the impact of inter - cell interference in cellular systems .",
    "and section   summarizes our conclusions .",
    "consider the uplink of a narrow - band cellular system , with each user having @xmath4 transmit antennas and each base station having @xmath5 @xmath10 receive antennas . at each time instance , only one user is scheduled and served in each cell .",
    "and simultaneous transmissions in different cells cause the inter - cell interference .",
    "it is assumed that there is no cooperation among the cells .",
    "for each receiver in the system , only the local - cell signal is concerned and the inter - cell interference is simply treated as noise .",
    "we further assume that the interference at a given base station is caused by the active links from its adjacent cells ( first - tier cells ) only .",
    "suppose each cell has @xmath11 adjacent cells .",
    "without loss of generality , we focus on one certain cell ( so called the reference cell ) in the system and assume that the user in the cell communicates with its intended base station under the presence of @xmath11 co - channel interferers .",
    "let us index the desired user in the reference cell by @xmath12 and index the interfering users in the adjacent cells by the numbers starting from @xmath13 to @xmath11 . at time _",
    ", given the transmitted signal vector @xmath14 of the @xmath15-th user , the received signal vector @xmath16 at the intended base station can be written as @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the complex gaussian noise vector with entries @xmath19 , @xmath20 denotes the average signal - to - noise ratio at each receive antenna of the base station and @xmath21 denotes the average interference - to - noise ratio at each receive antenna of the base station from the @xmath22-th ( @xmath23 ) interfering user .",
    "@xmath24 denotes the frequency - flat channel fading matrix between the @xmath22-th user and the base station . under rich scattering condition , @xmath24 is assumed to have independent and identically distributed entries with zero mean and unit variance .",
    "@xmath25-block length spatial - temporal codeword @xmath26 is chosen uniformly at random from the common codebook @xmath27 and launched at the @xmath22-th user .",
    "an overall power constraint is considered on @xmath27 as @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the size of the codebook , @xmath30 denotes the @xmath31-th codeword and @xmath32 denotes the frobenius norm of a matrix . for each transmission block ,",
    "data stream is first encoded , then interleaved and finally multiplexed into @xmath4 sub - streams .",
    "thus , vector @xmath33 can be regarded as the spatially encoded sample of @xmath34 at time instant @xmath35 .    in this paper",
    ", quasi - static fading environment is considered that each channel matrix is randomly chosen at the beginning but remains constant over the whole block length @xmath36 .",
    "and we assume that the channel state information ( csi ) between the @xmath22-th user ( @xmath37 ) and the receiver is perfectly known at the receiver but not available at any of the users .",
    "though , according to @xcite , generally , the interference channel matrix @xmath38 , @xmath39 , can not be estimated in cellular systems . in this work , for theoretical analysis",
    ", we assume that all the users may periodically send the orthogonalized pilot signals and thus the receivers can obtain the channel matrices accurately . according to @xcite and @xcite , without loss of optimality",
    ", we assume the distribution of @xmath40 to be circularly symmetric complex gaussian with zero mean and covariance matrix @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the identity matrix .",
    "we aim to characterize the fundamental tradeoff among the diversity order , multiplexing gain and inter - cell interference intensity . according to @xcite",
    ", we introduce the definition of _ multiplexing gain _ @xmath43 and _ diversity gain _ @xmath44 as follows :    _ definition 1 : _ a scheme @xmath45 operating at @xmath46 is said to achieve spatial multiplexing gain @xmath43 and diversity gain @xmath44 if the data rate @xmath47 satisfies @xmath48 and the average error probability @xmath49 satisfies @xmath50 similarly , according to @xcite , we introduce the inter - cell interference factor @xmath51 to asymptotically measure the inter - cell interference intensity of the @xmath15-th interferer @xmath52 with respect to @xmath46 as @xmath53 where @xmath54 we further introduce the notation of exponential equality @xmath55 to denote @xmath56 and we say that @xmath57 is exponential equal to @xmath58 , i.e. @xmath59 , if @xmath60 accordingly , the symbols @xmath61 and @xmath62 are defined .    in this work",
    ", we assume that the inter - cell interference @xmath52 , for @xmath63 , are exponentially equivalent that @xmath64 it can be interpreted as : though the interference caused by the co - channel interferers may differ from each other , they have the same rate of change @xmath1 with respect to the snr of the desired link .",
    "then , for asymptotic analysis , we rewrite ( [ receive - model ] ) as @xmath65    since for good codes and long block length _",
    ", the codeword error event can be characterized by the channel outage event at high snr region , we use the outage probability @xmath66 instead of error probability @xmath67 in ( [ diversity gain ] ) to capture the diversity behavior .",
    "the outage probability is defined as the probability that the mutual information of the channel fails to support the target rate .",

    "hence , a lower bound on the outage probability can be written as @xmath141 it could be immediately verified that the last line of ( [ outage probability upper bound ] ) and the last line of ( [ asymptotic outage probability upper bound ] ) are asymptotically equivalent . therefore , using the same argument as in ( [ solution of pout ] ) , we obtain the outage exponent upper bound as @xmath142 thus , the outage exponent upper bound equals to the lower bound .",

    "theorem 1 in the previous section characterized the fundamental tradeoff among the diversity order , multiplexing gain and inter - cell interference factor . given the dmt results in point - to - point scenarios as @xcite @xmath143 we can rewrite ( [ mmse dmt ] ) as @xmath144 @xmath145 @xmath146 obviously , the dmt performance in point - to - point scenarios can be characterized as a special case of the dmt performance in cellular systems when @xmath147 . for @xmath148 , according to ( [ dmt analysis ] ) , we can either degrade the diversity order for @xmath149 to maintain the multiplexing gain or pull down the degrees of freedom for @xmath150 but guarantee the diversity order .",
    "actually , this is due to the fact that the introduced interference reduces the minimum distance between the constellation points with a scale factor related to @xmath151 . specifically ,",
    "if @xmath152 , i.e. @xmath153 , the diversity order will suffer more loss from the inter - cell interference than the multiplexing gain , and vise versa . in fig .",
    "[ dmt function with interference ] , we plot the function @xmath154 for @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "the slope of the intersection line between the result plane and the @xmath157-@xmath158 plane describes the rate of change of @xmath44 with respect to @xmath151 .",
    "and the slope of the intersection line between the result plane and the @xmath159-@xmath158 plane describes the rate of change of @xmath43 with respect to @xmath151 .",
    "another implication from theorem 1 gives the fact that the dmt performance has nothing to do with the number of the interferers . to verify this point ,",
    "monte carlo simulation is employed and the corresponding results are shown in fig .",
    "[ different interferer number ] , where @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath160 and the target rate @xmath161 bits per channel use .",
    "we see that the diversity order keeps unchanged as the number of the interferers increases . and",
    "indeed , this observation implies that the dmt analysis can not fully characterize the tradeoff among the outage probability , data rate and the interference . in fig .",
    "[ different interferer number ] , though dmt remains the same for different number of interferers , for a given outage probability , a considerable increment on snr is required to support the target rate when more interferers are invloved . actually , according to @xcite ,",
    "dmt is only a coarse description of the fundamental tradeoff between the outage probability and the data rate .",
    "it asymptotically captures the rate of change of the outage probability and the data rate versus snr in the high - power regime , but ignores the constant offset .",
    "thus , though the number of the interferers has no effect on dmt , it affects the constant offset of the outage probability . and",
    "the exact impact of the number of the interferers on the system reliability and efficiency would be addressed in our future work .",

    "in this paper , we study the diversity and multiplexing tradeoff in the uplink of cellular systems to evaluate the impact of inter - cell interference on the system reliability and efficiency .",
    "when suboptimal linear mmse receiver is utilized , fundamental tradeoff among diversity order @xmath44 , multiplexing gain @xmath43 and inter - cell interference factor @xmath1 is asymptotically characterized as @xmath163 .",
    "given @xmath153 , it is shown that the diversity order will suffer more loss from the inter - cell interference than the multiplexing gain , and vise versa .",
    "we also observe the fact that , due to the weakness of the dmt characterization , the number of the interferers has no effect on dmt .",
    "therefore , a more complete picture of the impact of the interference is needed . in summary , in cellular mimo systems , we should take both the randomness of the channel and the inter - cell interference into consideration to achieve the optimized data rate and error probability .",
