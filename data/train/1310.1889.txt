    "atomic photoionization , an important astrophysical process , has been studied for more than a century since the seminal understanding of its energetics by @xcite and the first calculations of quantum mechanical cross sections @xcite . over the years",
    ", a plethora of experimental and theoretical investigations have managed an excellent grasp of its physics @xcite , together with a remarkable quantitative description of the valence - shell photoionization of atoms and atomic ions @xcite . however , the quantitative model of inner - shell photoabsorption is less sound due to a variety of relaxation processes , namely auger and x - ray emission , that must be taken into account in order to achieve acceptable accuracy , especially in the near - threshold region .",
    "inner - shell photoabsorption of metals with nuclear charge @xmath1 is directly accessible to modern x - ray observatories such as _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ , and , hence , is of much interest in astronomy .",
    "particularly prominent in the photoabsorption of the interstellar medium ( ism ) are the k - shell features ( lines and edges ) of atomic oxygen , which is the most abundant metal and is critically important in the energetic and chemical evolution of the universe @xcite . at present , though , the unsatisfactory quantitative understanding of oxygen inner - shell photoabsorption is such that there exists various sets of cross sections , each one leading to different conclusions regarding the ionization and atomic - to - molecular fractions in the ism along various galactic lines of sight .",
    "the first inner - shell photoabsorption cross sections of oxygen reported in the literature @xcite were simple step - function fits to low - resolution solid - state data @xcite or to theoretical calculations by @xcite using a central potential method .",
    "these results depict cross sections across inner - shell thresholds with unphysical discontinuous edges where even the threshold energies are poorly determined .",
    "these cross sections were used by @xcite in an early analysis of ism absorption near the oxygen k  edge in _",
    "chandra _ x - ray binary - star spectra .",
    "a later theoretical cross section , which took into account resonance effects , was computed by @xcite using the _ r_-matrix technique . however , this calculation failed to include the effects of orbital relaxation and spectator auger damping , which causes blending of the resonances converging to the inner - shell thresholds , thus smearing the otherwise sharp k - shell edge .",
    "this cross section was used by both @xcite and @xcite to analyze the ism k - shell absorption of oxygen in the _ chandra _ spectra towards x0614 + 091 and cyg  x-2 , respectively .",
    "all these studies found , after fitting the k@xmath2 line and edge , residual narrow absorption at @xmath323.36   and a broad edge feature at @xmath322.9  . in all cases ,",
    "the residual absorption was most likely attributed to oxygen compounds although the narrow absorption feature could also be due to .    by contrast",
    ", @xcite , using the _ xmm - newton _ reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) , found that the ism oxygen k - shell edge observed in x - ray binaries and extragalactic sources was well described by the _",
    "r_-matrix cross section of @xcite . a second _ r_-matrix calculation of the cross section was reported by @xcite , with full account of relaxation and auger damping , in fairly good agreement with the laboratory measurements of @xcite . as a result",
    ", @xcite analyzed the _",
    "spectra available at the time using the cross sections by both @xcite and @xcite , pointing out that the _ r_-matrix cross sections and those by @xcite agreed to within @xmath35% well above threshold but with significant differences in the threshold region .",
    "these differences were such that , when using the more recent cross section to fit the spectrum , the previously found broad threshold residuals disappeared .",
    "thus , it was concluded that the narrow absorption feature in the spectra , after subtracting the contribution , was due to trace amounts of ionized oxygen rather than to molecular compounds . @xcite also found that the discrepancies between the various calculations and experiments regarding the wavelengths of the k@xmath2 line and the k - shell threshold were considerably greater than the resolution of the astronomical spectra .",
    "therefore , this energy dispersion is perhaps the main source of uncertainty left in the atomic cross sections .    since then",
    ", @xcite have reported _",
    "r_-matrix calculations for the whole oxygen isonuclear sequence which , in the case of , agree to within @xmath4 with the near - threshold cross section of @xcite .",
    "subsequently , @xcite used these data sets to reanalyze seven _ xmm - newton _ observations of the x - ray binary sco  x-1 , and by adjusting the absolute wavelength scale of the theoretical cross sections , found that the spectra were well fitted by absorption alone with no conclusive evidence of contributions from any other source .",
    "on the other hand , a thorough study of _ xmm - newton _ spectra towards the low - mass binary gs 1826 - 238 by @xcite showed that the ism was composed of a mixture of multi - phase gas , dust , and molecules ; in the case of oxygen , its abundance was found to be 2030% higher than protosolar , and at least 10% of its column density was in the form of molecules and dust grains .",
    "these findings have been confirmed by @xcite in a more extensive survey of nine low - mass x - ray binaries where 1525% of the total amount of oxygen was found to be condensed in dust .",
    "moreover , in a recent examination of several _ chandra _ spectra towards the low - mass binary xte j1817 - 330 , @xcite  in order to fit the absorption lines from both the high- ( , ) and low - excitation ( , , ) plasma components  were forced again to shift the photoionization cross sections of @xcite , where the discrepancies pointed out by @xcite regarding the observed and measured positions for the k@xmath2 and k@xmath5 lines in still stood .",
    "@xcite report an oxygen abundance close to solar which in essence dissents from the conclusions reached by @xcite .",
    "laboratory measurements of the k vacancy states @xcite , in particular the @xmath6 resonance , also show a bothersome scatter .",
    "this issue will be addressed more fully in section  [ seclabexp ] since this uncertainty , and that of the observations of interstellar oxygen x - ray spectra , are at the heart of the remaining issue of absolute energy normalization .",
    "the recent experiment of @xcite is similar to the earlier study by @xcite , but the entire resonance region is now covered in one continuous scan in photon energy as opposed to the previous piecemeal scans for the lower @xmath7 member and the higher @xmath8 rydberg series ; however , nearly identical energy positions are reported .",
    "the new theoretical results , on the other hand , are obtained from a 910-level @xmath0-matrix calculation that , upon close inspection , are essentially equivalent to those in @xcite .",
    "thus , there is nothing substantively new learned from this study other than a reconfirmation of the same resonance energy positions ; this issue will be addressed more fully in section  [ seclabexp ] .",
    "the ultimate purpose of the present study is to arrive at a consensus for the best description of the photoionization cross section for neutral atomic oxygen . to this end",
    ", it is advantageous to create a single photoabsorption model that is transparent to all atomic data users .",
    "this is most easily accomplished by formulating an analytical expression that includes all the essential features desired by modelers : accurate background cross sections ( the `` shoulders '' ) , line positions , widths , and oscillator strengths .",
    "we accomplish this by appealing to a combination of @xmath0-matrix computations , laboratory measurements , tabulated solid - state absorption data , independent - particle ( ip ) data , multi - configuration atomic structure calculations , and astronomically observed x - ray lines . given a consistent photoabsorption cross section , we then plan to use the same atomic description in two different x - ray spectral modeling codes to render the ism oxygen k features .",
    "we attempt to develop an analytical expression for the most reliable photoabsorption cross section possible .",
    "we begin with new @xmath0-matrix calculations , which are slight improvements over earlier results @xcite that were benchmarked favorably to experiment @xcite . these results , together with experimental measurements ,",
    "allow for the most accurate representation of the strong @xmath9 resonances below the k  edge . at energies far below the k - edge region , where only outer - shell photoionization occurs",
    ", we use the formula of @xcite which is a simple fit to the ip results of @xcite , and is found to be in excellent agreement with the present @xmath0-matrix results . at higher energies , a fit to the tabulated data of @xcite is used ; these data are assessed to be the most accurate since important shake - up and shake - off processes are also accounted for ( see section  [ secrmat ] ) .",
    "the resulting total photoabsorption cross section as a function of photon energy @xmath10 is thus partitioned as @xmath11 to illustrate this demarcation , we plot several data sets of the photoabsorption cross section in fig .",
    "[ figfittotal ] , where the three energy regions are all depicted . for energies below @xmath12",
    "ev , the cross section consists solely of the @xmath13 outer - shell photoionization contribution , whereas just below the k - edge region , the strong @xmath9 resonance absorption profiles dominate . at higher energies , the cross section is essentially due to direct @xmath14 photoionization and accompanying photoionization - excitation and double photoionization ( which the present @xmath15-photoionization @xmath0-matrix calculations do not include as discussed in section  [ secrmat ] ) .",
    "these three regions , and the precise theoretical modeling of each , are henceforth outlined .      for the outer - shell photoionization cross section",
    ", we have verified that the fit of @xcite is reliable , and their analytical formula @xmath16y^{(p-11)/2}\\left(1+\\sqrt{y / y_a}\\right)^{-p } \\label{eqsig2s2p}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is therefore adopted , where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and the fitting parameters @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are listed in table  [ tablefit ] .",
    "the fit is seen in fig .",
    "[ figfittotal ] to be in close agreement with the present @xmath0-matrix results and with the tabulated data of @xcite at energies slightly above the @xmath26 ionization threshold up through the region just below the @xmath9 resonances . at lower energies , important channel - coupling effects and prominent outer - shell resonance structure",
    "are found in the @xmath0-matrix results ( and modeled somewhat more crudely in * ? ? ?",
    "however , since we are not concerned with such low energies , the present fit is sufficient .",
    "it should be noted that , just below the resonance region at about 520  ev , there is coupling between the ( open ) @xmath27 and ( closed ) @xmath28 channels that gives rise to a slight dip in the @xmath26 @xmath0-matrix cross section ( not observable on the scale of fig .",
    "[ figfittotal ] ) due to a transfer of oscillator strength @xcite .",
    "this small dip over such a narrow energy region is ignored in the present final model .",
    "we find that the data of @xcite above the @xmath15 threshold can be accurately fitted with the expression @xmath29\\left(\\frac{e_{th}}{e}\\right)^3\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the fit threshold position is chosen to be @xmath30  ev , giving a threshold cross section of @xmath31  mb and parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 , which are needed for further fitting ( see table  [ tablefit ] ) .",
    "we choose this functional form in our desire to derive an expression that matches continuously from below each of the two main thresholds , and therefore , only the two parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 are needed to get the correct shape of the above - threshold cross section .",
    "our strategy in the @xmath9 resonance region is first to formulate an analytical fit ( see section  [ secanalyticalfit ] ) to the results from new @xmath0-matrix calculations ( detailed in section  [ secrmat ] ) .",
    "the fit parameters are then adjusted slightly to match the experimental resonance positions and oscillator strengths , highlighting both the best assessment of the absolute energy scales as determined by line observations and the smooth consistent merging to the above - threshold and high - energy cross section .",
    "the present @xmath0-matrix approach is based closely on the earlier work of @xcite , the essential difference being in the present removal of pseudo - resonances .",
    "further improvements include , firstly , a new computation of the spectator auger widths using a resonance time - delay matrix analysis @xcite within an independent @xmath0-matrix calculation for the @xmath36 scattering .",
    "a second improvement involves a smooth turn - off of the spectator auger damping @xmath37 @xcite as the effective quantum number approaches the orbital angular momentum ( @xmath38 ) to avoid the discontinuity previously seen when the quantum defect approach is abruptly turned off .",
    "here we allow the width to vanish continuously ( @xmath39 ) in this limit before the quantum defect channel is  closed \" off @xcite .    as in earlier work @xcite",
    ", we also emphasize the critical importance of accounting for orbital relaxation following inner - shell photoionization : the @xmath40 and @xmath41  relaxed \" orbitals in the final @xmath42 vacancy state distinctively differ from those in the initial @xmath43 ground state due to the doubling of the effective charge seen in the state . as a result ,",
    "the computation of the direct cross section involves an overlap amplitude factor proportional to the @xmath44 and @xmath45 orbital overlap integrals , and it is therefore imperative to account for this orbital difference . within an orthonormal basis methodology , such as the @xmath0-matrix approach we use here @xcite , the only way to accomplish",
    "this is by introducing _ pseudo - orbitals _ ( e.g. @xmath46 , @xmath47 , etc . )",
    "such that the relaxed excited state can be described in terms of the ground state and the pseudo - orbitals via @xmath48 this procedure takes care of the relaxation effect , and in the present case , the reduction factor can be independently computed from simple multi - configuration hartree ",
    "fock ( mchf ) calculations @xcite to be @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , there is an analytically predicted reduction effect by a factor of 0.80 due to relaxation , and the remaining 20% of the oscillator strength goes into photoionization - excitation and double photoionization .",
    "an excellent discussion of these various contributions is given in the early experimental study of photoionization by @xcite ( see , especially , their fig .",
    "the effect of relaxation can also be seen by comparing the present @xmath0-matrix cross section with one where relaxation is not taken into account ( fig .",
    "[ figrmat ] ) .",
    "the present , final @xmath0-matrix cross section is seen to approach asymptotically the ip fit cross section of @xcite , namely the scaled @xmath15 cross section after the latter has had the @xmath15 contribution multiplied by a factor of 0.80  the same overlap factor we compute from an independent mchf calculation thus independently confirming the 20% reduction effect .",
    "it should be noted that the original ip calculations @xcite , upon which @xcite based their fit , did not include relaxation effects .",
    "consequently , their asymptotic value reflects the _ total _ photoabsorption cross section , which includes shake - up and shake - off processes in addition to the direct @xmath15 photoionization ( without secondary excitation or ionization ) .",
    "however , as also seen in fig .",
    "[ figrmat ] , even though the unrelaxed orbital results approach the full ip cross section @xcite asymptotically , they grossly overestimate the correct cross section just above the k - shell threshold ; here only the ( relaxed ) direct photoionization is energetically allowed .",
    "this overvalue carries over below threshold , leading to an unphysically enhanced resonance oscillator strengths .",
    "moreover , note that the threshold energy _ position",
    "_ is also overestimated  by more than 10 ev  due to the inaccurate representation of the @xmath50 inner - shell vacancy state .",
    "it is therefore critical to account for relaxation effects ; this is accomplished in the present theoretical methodology by including additional pseudo - orbitals in the atomic orbital basis set . however , without proper care , this procedure can lead to spurious _ pseudo - resonance _",
    "structure @xcite as is also shown in fig .  [ figrmat ] .",
    "the present @xmath0-matrix results , which were computed with pseudo - orbitals and with a proper elimination of pseudo - resonances @xcite , are compared to similar @xmath0-matrix results without such an elimination .",
    "it is seen that the latter cross section exhibits large , spurious pseudo - resonance structure at higher energies .",
    "furthermore , these broad , unphysical resonance features are seen to permeate even down to the threshold region , resulting in an overestimate of the near threshold cross section ( and the resonance absorption oscillator strengths below threshold ) . by applying the pseudo - resonance elimination method @xcite",
    ", the cross section turns out to be smooth throughout , and provides the most reliable resonance oscillator strengths as discussed in section  [ secrmat ] .",
    "it is to be noted that the earlier @xmath0-matrix calculations did not use a pseudo - resonance elimination method and , therefore , overestimated the resonance absorption oscillator strengths ; this was pointed out by @xcite and also depicted in their fig .  2 .",
    "we can improve the asymptotic situation somewhat by including the orthogonal compliments to the @xmath50 o@xmath51 ( relaxed ) target states , namely the additional _ pseudo - states _ which are composed of the @xmath52 and @xmath53 configurations ( with smaller @xmath320% mixing of the @xmath50 configurations ) .",
    "this resultant , so - called @xmath0-matrix with pseudo - states ( rmps ) method @xcite , as implemented in the present codes following the developments of @xcite , gives a somewhat crude , approximate description of the photoionization - excitation and double photoionization channels , and importantly , leads to the correct high - energy photoionization asymptote , as seen in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ figrmat ] .",
    "we note that the implementation of r - matrix methods on modern massively parallel machines @xcite will allow for a much larger , converged rmps treatment of the problem .",
    "the findings thus far regarding the above - threshold cross section are summarized in fig .",
    "[ highe ] : asymptotically , the present @xmath0-matrix cross section approaches the ip results after the ( dominant ) @xmath15 contribution has been scaled by a factor of 0.8 to account for relaxation , whereas the rmps values show the correct asymptote but are still plagued by pseudo - resonances .",
    "the fit of @xcite at threshold is an extrapolation of the high - energy ip cross section of @xcite , and therefore , does not include the correct threshold rise as is seen in the @xmath0-matrix results . on the other hand , the data of @xcite , which are based on solid - state measurements , show the correct threshold and asymptotic cross sections and are devoid of pseudo - resonance structure ; therefore , we choose this continuous data as the best representation of the cross section for energies above threshold .",
    "note that the @xmath0-matrix and rmps cross sections just above threshold coincide with the data by @xcite .",
    "lastly , note that the measurements of @xcite are consistent with the @xmath0-matrix results throughout , as we further address in section  [ secfinalfit ] .",

    "[ eqfit ] to the @xmath0-matrix results , we obtain the parameters that are listed in table  [ tablefit ]",
    ". however , our initial fit used  in addition to the same widths as determined in the @xmath0-matrix run ( 0.1348  ev and 0.1235  ev for series @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively)the theoretical threshold energy positions @xmath114 ev and @xmath115 ev . as is seen at all levels in fig .",
    "[ figexp ] , this prescription provides an excellent fit to the @xmath0-matrix results .",
    "the fit formula was next compared to the experimental cross section of @xcite ( shifted by + 0.58 ev in order to position the @xmath85 resonance at 527.37  ev ) . however , in order to align our fit with these shifted experimental results , which comprise our assessment of the most accurate resonance positions , we had to shift our theoretical threshold energies by @xmath116  ev and @xmath117  ev for the two series @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "this has the simple effect of shifting every individual resonance of each series by these amounts . furthermore , in order to obtain the most meaningful comparison , it was necessary to convolute the fitting expression with a gaussian of 182  mev fwhm to simulate the experimental resolution .",
    "finally , it was necessary to upscale the @xmath7 oscillator strength to match the more reliable mchf value of 0.097 ( see table  [ tablemchf ] ) ; the r - matrix @xmath7 oscillator strength was scaled down by a factor of @xmath118 from the @xmath71 series limit , and we use as the final fit the slightly increased value @xmath119 , which ensures an oscillator strength of @xmath120 .    with these final adjustments , the resulting fit is seen to reproduce the experimental results very well except for the @xmath7 resonance strength . note that in particular the quantum defects for each of the two series , as determined from the fit to the @xmath0-matrix results , align satisfactorily with the experimental values indicating that , regarding energy determination , the main source of error lies in determining accurate threshold positions .",
    "furthermore , with respect to the experimental spectrum , it seems that , if there is any error at all , it must be an overall global offset that we assume here to be @xmath121  ev .",
    "we note that the fit formula of eq .",
    "[ eqfit ] could have just been modified by replacing the unit lorentzian profiles by unit voigt profiles , but it is actually straightforward to simply convolute the resulting cross section numerically .",
    "nevertheless , this highlights the flexibility of the analytical fitting formula in that the particular resonance shape can be , if desired , easily accounted for analytically .    as a last key point",
    ", we comment that experiment has a noticeable signal due to molecular o@xmath122 contamination in the beam as evidenced by the strong @xmath123 resonance at 531  ev .",
    "consequently , there is an additional signal in the experiment throughout the k - edge region , and the experimental procedure does not provide the most accurate benchmark away from resonance . on resonance ,",
    "the signal is so strong and predominantly atomic in nature that the small molecular admixture would not affect the oscillator strength as much .",
    "the three data sets of x - ray absorption currently used in spectral modeling codes we wish to compare to the present fit are : ( 1 ) the @xmath0-matrix cross sections of @xcite ; ( 2 ) the xstar modeling code which uses the @xmath0-matrix cross sections of @xcite ( except for independent data for the the lowest @xmath85 resonance ) ; and ( 3 ) spex which is based on calculations with hfr @xcite for resonances and data by @xcite elsewhere .",
    "a comparison is given in fig .",
    "[ figcomp ] between these various approaches and the present fit where several points must be brought to light .",
    "first , the cross section of @xcite , at least with respect to resonance positions , is close to the present fit since it is based on similar @xmath0-matrix calculations .",
    "however , the resonance oscillator strengths and the above - threshold cross section are higher , and this was explained in section [ secrmat ] as being due to pseudo - resonance contamination present in the earlier @xmath0-matrix calculations .",
    "furthermore , the earlier @xmath0-matrix results show a minor discontinuity at the low - energy tail of the @xmath124 resonance ( @xmath125  ev ) due to the sudden turn off of spectator auger damping which , as discussed in section [ secrmat ] , we alleviate in the present study .",
    "the @xmath0-matrix results in xstar by @xcite are seen in fig .",
    "[ figcomp ] to be even higher than the present fit , regarding both the resonance oscillator strengths and the above - threshold cross section , and this is believed to be due to an insufficient treatment of both configuration interaction and relaxation effects . in that work",
    ", relaxation is partially accounted for by optimizing the orbitals on a weighted sum of closed-@xmath15-shell and @xmath15-vacancy states of @xcite .",
    "lastly , it must be emphasized that the spex model has gaps in the total oscillator strength density since only a finite number of terms are included for each rydberg series .",
    "the unconvoluted natural widths are underestimated ( in the original data , at least ) since the spectator auger decay was not taken into account ; the included participator auger width approaches zero as @xmath62 increases ( @xmath126 ) .",
    "additionally , the above - threshold cross section is matched to the ip results of @xcite which , as discussed in section [ secrmat ] , underestimates the threshold value .",
    "we also show the newer _",
    "r_-matrix results of @xcite , and they are seen to closely reproduce the earlier _ r_-matrix results of @xcite including the overestimate of the above - threshold cross section , as discussed in section [ secrmat ] .",
    "one additional shortcoming in the new _",
    "r_-matrix results is that , since spectator auger decay is not implicitly accounted for in that formulation , the predicted natural widths are underestimated ( and , indeed , scale unphysically as @xmath127 as @xmath71 ) .",
    "the final expression for the photoabsorption cross section consists of the sum of the cross sections in eq .",
    "[ eqtotal ] , where @xmath13 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 are given by eqs .",
    "[ eqsig2s2p ] , [ eqfit ] , and [ eqfit2 ] , respectively , and the required fitting parameters are listed in table  [ tablefit ] .",
    "this final expression has several desirable features which we would like to reinforce .",
    "* it is an analytical formula easily transportable between different platforms and modeling codes ; in fact , the fortran routine used to generate a numerical photoabsorption cross section for all energies involves only about one hundred lines of code . *",
    "the formulation contains adjustable fitting parameters to best represent : ( 1 ) the k - edge positions ; ( 2 ) the @xmath71 energy - independent quantum defects and oscillator strengths ; and ( 3 ) the energy - dependent quantum defects and oscillator strengths for the lower two resonances . from this fit",
    ", all relevant atomic parameters can be read off ; for instance , the strongest @xmath85 oscillator strength can be computed from our fit as @xmath130 and the integrated resonance strength is therefore given by @xmath131 mb - ev .",
    "further modifications to these parameters can be made if so desired . *",
    "the energy spectrum is optimized on the resonance positions determined from a combined experimental and observational assessment . *",
    "a constant - resonance - width cross section  a lorentzian profile that is predicted on physical grounds due to spectator auger broadening  is implicitly included in the final expression , and can be further modified analytically to include additional broadening effects . * a consistent threshold formulation is obtained in that the @xmath132 series limit for the ( scaled ) oscillator strength joins analytically and smoothly to the above - threshold oscillator strength density @xmath133 . *",
    "the consistent above - threshold cross section has the important factor of 0.80 reduction due to relaxation effects , and is then extended to higher energies to include the shake - up and shake - off processes , which result in photoionization - excitation and double photoionization contributions to account for the 20% difference , and giving the correct @xmath134 high - energy asymptote , i.e. an accurate  shoulder \" .",
    "we have developed an analytical expression that encapsulates all of the important physics in x - ray absorption of atomic oxygen at all photon energies relevant to spectral modeling . for energies below or above the k - edge resonance region ,",
    "we use simple parametric fits to our best assessment of the cross section based on a convergence between experimental and theoretical data .",
    "the strong @xmath9 resonances belonging to the two dipole - favored rydberg series , on the other hand , require special attention regarding the oscillator strengths ( and analytic continuation to the above - threshold direct @xmath15 cross section ) and resonance positions .",
    "for this important region , we appeal to a combination of @xmath0-matrix and mchf theoretical calculations , laboratory experiments , and x - ray astronomical observations .",
    "an outstanding issue that we wish to underline is the rather large discrepancy of @xmath135  ev between several recent observational assessments and the latest laboratory experiments .",
    "unconventionally , we have chosen to use the final calibration as suggested by the observations , since several sources and an independent large mchf calculation tend to add credibility to this choice .",
    "furthermore , the recent laboratory experiments @xcite calibrated the photon energy scale using the molecular oxygen rydberg resonance features , and it is unclear to us how accurately those _ molecular _ positions are known , especially considering the uncertainties we find facing us regarding the _ atomic _ resonance positions .",
    "we note that a repeat of those experimental measurements , calibrated instead to the more well - known co and co@xmath122 k - edge features , will be performed in the near future @xcite , and this will certainly help to shed more light on the existing discrepancy .",
    "the ultimate goal of the present work is to establish a definitive , transparent , and easily transportable photoabsorption cross section that can be incorporated in the two spectral modeling codes , namely xstar and spex .",
    "the consistent use of this developed photoabsorption expression in both methods to address molecular abundances in the ism , and clarify the existing controversy regarding the atomic  molecular fractions @xcite , will be the subject of a subsequent follow - up paper .",
