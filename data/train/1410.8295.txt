    "this effect is commonly used in the mode - locked solid state lasers  @xcite aimed at producing extremely short light pulses .",
    "heterostructures with embedded saturable absorber paved the way for studies of dissipative solitons ( dss ) which became the focus of optics research about two decades ago  @xcite due to their fundamental properties and potential for various applications in information processing  @xcite theoretical work on cavity solitons  @xcite has stimulated a variety of experiments .",
    "@xcite in heterostructure devices with saturable absorption , solitons can be engineered via geometry and alloy composition control .",
    "@xcite    in this manuscript , we propose a new kind of cavity exciton ",
    "polariton - based ds and develop protocols aimed at its creation ( switch on ) and destruction ( switch off ) .",
    "exciton polaritons ( later , polaritons ) represent hybrid light - matter bosonic quasiparticles emerging in high - quality ( high - q ) semiconductor microcavities .",
    "@xcite they have half - photonic character allowing for fast propagation of the particle wavelets and also they represent half - excitons with nonlinear self - interaction .",
    "polaritons have proven to be highly promising entities from both the fundamental and application - oriented points of view .",
    "moreover , thanks to recent technological progress , high - q microcavities of any geometry are routinely produced .",
    "indeed , the state - of - the - art fabrication technology allows for creation of various semiconductor heterostructures with desired spatial patterns in the lateral directions .",
    "for instance , producing confining potentials of various kinds @xcite results in a growing number of theoretical proposals .",
    "@xcite another reason why polaritons attract growing interest is that they can form quasi - bose ",
    "einstein condensation ( bec )  @xcite which is similar to bec of quasiparticles in other mesoscopic systems .",
    "@xcite     one more important reason why microcavities are advantageous over classical optical systems is the ability to access nonlinear kerr - like media with large exciton - mediated response of the system due to particle self - scattering .",
    "this scattering leads to further reduction of the required input power and the characteristic size of spatial formations .",
    "@xcite indeed , the cubic nonlinearity associated with the coulomb and exchange interaction between exciton polaritons ( later , _ polaritons _ ) , usually plays crucial role in dynamics and stability of spatial formations  @xcite and allows the observation of effects similar to those obtained in kerr media such as formation of stationary and moving optical dark and bright solitons .",
    "@xcite while repulsive polariton self - interaction favors the onset of dark solitons ,  @xcite bright solitons have been produced in the region of dispersion corresponding to negative effective mass .",
    "for instance , in ref .     in a microcavity",
    ", polaritons can be described by a macroscopic wave function ( also called the order parameter ) with dynamics governed by the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) .",
    "@xcite in our work , we will show the contribution of the kerr - like nonlinear terms but we will mainly focus on the ds formation due to presence of saturable absorber inside the structure exclusively . physically ,",
    "appearance of a soliton in such structures results from the increase of effective lifetime of electromagnetic field mode in the regions of high polariton density .",
    "mathematically , saturable absorption manifests itself in the nonlinear term in the equation of motion for the order parameter , as will be shown below .",
    "an important feature of exciton polaritons in a microcavity is strong interaction with acoustic phonons of the crystal lattice . in the case when the ds is in the center of the nanowire , phonons may act as an additional mechanism which takes the excitations away from the central regions to the sides .",
    "thus , phonons tend to turn a soliton - like propagation into a diffusion - like motion .",
    "this leads to a detuning and destruction of the soliton .",
    "therefore , one has to change the settings of the pumping parameters necessary for soliton formation .",
    "in other words , dss at zero temperature and at finite temperature represent two different nonlinear objects . on the other hand",

    "two laser pulses : coherent , @xmath4 , and incoherent , @xmath5 , are used to switch the ds on and off . ]",
    "this part is not the core element of the model , since it is not responsible for creation of the dss qualitatively .",
    "however , accounting for the phonons makes our simulations realistic and applicable to model experiments .",
    "we employ the theory developed in ref .  .",
    "thus , in our calculations the fourier transform of the polariton field , @xmath6 , in @xmath7-space , @xmath8 , is coupled to the fourier transform of the phonon field , @xmath9 , modeled using stochastic variables . here",
    "@xmath10 is a coordinate vector , @xmath11 is time , and @xmath12 , @xmath13 are wave vectors of polaritons and phonons , respectively . indeed , remembering that phonons represent an incoherent thermal reservoir , we can use the markov approximation , when phonons are assumed to have a randomly varying phase .",
    "@xcite    we consider a system of polaritons presented in fig .",
    "[ figsystem ] and investigate one - dimensional ( 1d ) propagation of particles along a channel inside the cavity .",

    "@xcite      onwards , in the second line of eq .",
    "we use the dependence of polariton inverse lifetime on their concentration , @xmath34 , thus the second term in the second line in square brackets is the saturable absorption - mediated term .  @xcite writing this term this way , we assume that the saturable absorber has small relaxation time and thus we can neglect its internal dynamics .",
    "the nonlinear dependence of inverse particle lifetime on their density stimulates the increase of the lifetime in the regions with high density and thus provides spatially - dependent lifetime - enhanced formation of localized structures . here",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 are the main parameters describing the saturable absorber , both acting on the photonic parts of polaritons : @xmath35 has the meaning of the effective polariton lifetime with account of the saturable absorption in the limit @xmath36 , @xmath3 characterizes the saturation intensity , @xmath37 . in the limit @xmath38 , @xmath39 and the particle lifetime",

    "it should be noted , given that the absorber is situated inside a dbr , both @xmath2 and @xmath3 have direct correspondence with the photonic parts of polaritons solely ( not the excitonic part ) .",
    "indeed , this last term in the second line of eq .   has been adapted from the classical laser optics @xcite where a similar expression is used as a saturation term of the electric field vector in the description of a laser operation . however , due to the fact that the lifetime of polaritons is mostly determined by the lifetime of photons in the cavity ( inverse lifetimes of photons and excitons scales as @xmath41 ) and here this condition is additionally strengthened ( due to additional photonic losses caused by the saturable absorber ) , we conclude that lifetime of polaritons is also determined by the photonic lifetime and therefore formula   is feasible .",
