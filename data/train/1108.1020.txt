    "blazars are the most variable subclass of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "the most prominent property of blazars is the rapid and strong variability in their continuum emission .",
    "the continuum emission and its variability is believed to originate from the relativistic jet pointed basically to our line of sight . in the frame work of leptonic model",
    ", the low energy continuum emission of blazars has a synchrotron origin , while the high energy continuum emission is from inverse compton upscattering of the low energy emission by the relativistic electrons in the jet .",
    "the low energy seed photons may either be produced in the jet ( the synchrotron self - compton or ssc process ) or come from the accretion disc , broad line region ( blr ) , or dusty torus ( for a recent review , see * ? ? ?",
    "blazars can be subdivided into flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) and bl lacs , depending on whether or not there are strong emission lines in their spectra .",

    "based on a collection of the historical data and on their own observations , @xcite found that 3c  345 varied by more than 3.0 mags in the @xmath3 band from 1965 to 1995 . on short time - scales",

    "the overall amplitude in the @xmath0 band ( used in the whole monitoring period ) is 2.640 mags . in 2006 , where the source was monitored in the @xmath11 , @xmath0 and @xmath12 bands , the variation amplitudes in the three bands are respectively 1.656 , 1.829 and 1.731 mags . in 20072009 ( or from jd 245 4192 to jd 245 4591 ) , where the source was monitored in the @xmath10 , @xmath0 and @xmath13 bands , the amplitudes are respectively 1.652 , 1.964 and 1.947 mags",
    ". then two conclusions can be drawn .",
    "firstly , the amplitude in the @xmath11 or @xmath10 band is the smallest among those in the three bands ( @xmath11 , @xmath0 and @xmath12 , or @xmath10 , @xmath0 and @xmath13 ) .",
    "this is similar to the case of the inovs in this object mentioned above .",
    "secondly , the @xmath0 band amplitude is greater than the corresponding @xmath12 or @xmath13 band amplitude .",
    "the long - term colour behaviours of 3c  345 were studied by using the nightly - average magnitudes . for the 2006 data ,",
    "the colour indices of @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 were calculated and plotted against @xmath11 , @xmath11 and @xmath0 , respectively , in the left panels of fig .",
    "[ f5 ] . for the 20072009 data ,",
    "the colour indices of @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 were calculated and plotted against @xmath10 , @xmath10 and @xmath0 , respectively , in the right panels of fig .",
    "the @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 colours got redder when the source became brighter , whereas the @xmath23 and @xmath26 colours got bluer when the source became brighter .",
    "the correlation coefficients are respectively @xmath270.958 , @xmath270.557 , @xmath270.794 , @xmath270.702 , 0.707 and 0.307 , and the chance probabilities are respectively @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "there are much fewer data points in the left panels than in the right ones , so the correlations in the left ones are weaker than those in the right ones , but the overall trends are the same .",
    "for the two nights ( jds 245 3783 and 245 3786 ) showing inovs , the colour - magnitude relation was also explored . because there is no @xmath11-band observation on the latter night",
    ", we only studied the @xmath23 colour versus @xmath0 magnitude correlation . when calculating the @xmath23 colour , the @xmath12-band light curve on the two nights were linearly interpolated or extrapolated so as to get the @xmath12 magnitudes at exactly the same time when the @xmath0-band observations were made .",
    "the result is displayed in fig .",
    "the object tends to be bwb .",
    "the correlation coefficient is 0.809 and the chance probability is @xmath34 , indicating a strong bwb chromatism .",
    "therefore , both rwb and bwb chromatisms were observed in the variability of 3c  345 .",
    "this is quite different from the previous results on the spectral or colour behaviour of blazars , in which usually only one kind of colour behaviour is reported for one object . or at most , an object , except for displaying either rwb or bwb chromatism in its middle- and short - term variability , may be achromatic for its long - term variability ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or during a certain episode of time @xcite .",
    "one exception is that @xcite have recognized both rwb and bwb trends in s5  0716 + 714 , but at different times .",
    "our study , however , revealed that the rwb and bwb chromatisms appeared in 3c  345 at the same time and/or in both the long - term variability and inovs .",
    "this is the first report of such a phenomenon in the study of the colour behaviour of blazars .",
    "several authors have studied the colour or spectral behaviour of 3c  345 .",
    "they all found a rwb or steeper - when - brighter behaviour in the optical domain in this object ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , there may be a cutoff magnitude ( @xmath35 ) in the colour - magnitude correlation , as noted by @xcite .",
    "when the object is brighter than that magnitude , its colour is much less dependent on the magnitude .",
    "this cutoff magnitude may also exist in the colour - magnitude diagrams in @xcite and @xcite , but is not so obvious as in @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that a few components in the _ uv _ to blue band of the spectrum of 3c  345 may be responsible for the rwb or steeper - when - brighter behaviour @xcite .",
    "these components include the mgii emission line at 2798  and the blue bump ( bb ) from 1000 to 4000  in the rest frame of this object .",
    "the bb itself consists of a forest of the feii emission lines , the balmer continuum re - emission and the 1000040000 k black body emission . unlike the underlying non - thermal continuum ( hereafter ntc ) , which is believed to come from the jet , these features come either from the accretion disc or from the blr .",
    "their variation properties should resemble those of the same emission features of normal quasars , i.e. , they are variable but have smaller amplitudes and longer time - scales than the ntc variability of blazars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "when 3c  345 is in low state , these less variable emission features ( hereafter lvefs ) dominate the fluxes and dilute the variability at short wavelengths .",
    "so the variation amplitudes at short wavelengths are smaller than those at long wavelengths , as manifested by @xcite and this work (  3 ) , leading naturally to a rwb behaviour when the measurements at short wavelengths ( @xmath36 , @xmath3 , @xmath37 , @xmath10 or @xmath11 ) are included in the colour calculation @xcite .",
    "when 3c  345 is in high state ( brighter than the cutoff magnitude of @xmath38 ) , the underlying ntc become strong and may match the lvefs in strength . then the object will show a stable colour , as illustrated in @xcite .    on the other hand , when the colour or spectral index is computed by using two measurements at long wavelengths where the lvefs are not included in , we ll get a bwb or flatter - when - brighter behaviour for 3c  345 , as for its bwb behaviour in the @xmath23 and @xmath26 colours in this work and its flatter - when - brighter trend in the infrared regime in @xcite .",
    "similar colour behaviour has been observed for at least two more fsrqs . in 3c  454.3",
    ", the colour is rwb in faint state , reaches a ` saturation ' at @xmath39 , and turns into bwb in bright state @xcite .",
    "these behaviours were also explained in terms of a thermal component , probably from the accretion disc , in the emission of 3c  454.3 @xcite .",
    "for pks 1510 - 089 , which has a pronounced bb in its spectrum @xcite , it exhibits a rwb trend except for its prominent flare , which can be explained by the strong contribution of thermal emission from the accretion disc @xcite .    therefore , the mgii+bb emission can significantly change the colour behaviour of fsrqs . except for the mgii line and the bb ,",
    "there are some other strong emission features in the spectrum of fsrqs , such as the ly@xmath40 , civ@xmath41 , ciii]@xmath42 , h@xmath43+[oiii]@xmath44+feii and h@xmath45 lines .",
    "these features emanate from the blr rather than from the jet , and are thus expected to be less variable than the underlying ntc",
    ". they may also significantly change the colour behaviour of fsrqs when one or more of them is included in the passbands that are used in the computation of the colour index , especially when the observations are made with an intermediate- or narrow - band filter system .    in order to assess how the emission lines change the measured fluxes in the passbands they reside",
    ", we then made a number of simulations by convolving the fsrq spectrum with the transmission curves of several filter systems .",
    "the spectrum was shifted from 0 to 3 with a step of 0.01 .",
    "each spectrum was convolved with the transmission curves , so as to see the redshift effects on the measured fluxes .",
    "we used a composite quasar spectrum to mimic the fsrq spectrum in order to have a high signal - to - noise ratio and a large enough wavelength coverage .",
    "the fsrq spectrum resembles the normal quasar spectrum in the content of the emission lines .",
    "however , their continua may differ much .",
    "the quasar spectrum usually has a strong bb , while the fsrq spectrum has no or only weak bb due to the prominence of the strongly beamed jet emission @xcite .",
    "we kept the emission features of the composite quasar spectrum but partly removed the bb from the continuum .",
    "the modified composite quasar spectrum was then used in the convolutions .",
    "the composite quasar spectrum was adopted as a combination of the _ hst uv _ composite from 650 to 1150  @xcite , the 2df quasar composite from 1150 to 6930  @xcite and a near - infrared composite from 6930 to 10600  @xcite .",
    "we assigned a spectral index of 1.52 @xcite to the continuum from 1000 to 10600  and a spectral index of 2.6 for the continuum from 650 to 1000  , so as to add a weak bb into the continuum .",
    "the spectral index @xmath46 is defined as @xmath47 .",
    "this modified composite spectrum is plotted in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ f7 ] . for a comparison , the composite of the large bright quasar survey ( lbqs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is also plotted , demonstrating the strong bb peaked at around 1300  .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ f7 ] displays the transmission curves of the batc ( 15 intermediate bands ) , sdss ( five broad bands , @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) and johnson - cousins ( j - c , five broad band , @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) filter systems .",
    "the convolutions were made at first between the composite spectrum and the batc transmission curves .",
    "the resulting fluxes in the 15 intermediate bands were plotted in logarithm scale as colours in fig .",
    "the open circles label the redshifts at which the emission lines move to the weighted centers of the passbands .",
    "one can see from that figure that the strong emission lines move gradually from the short- to long - wavelength batc passband with increasing redshift , as shown by the dashed lines .",
    "this figure demonstrates clearly that the strong emission lines can significantly enhance the measured fluxes in the passbands they are included in and that the enhancement changes with redshift . at the redshift close to 0.6 ,",
    "the fluxes of 3c  345 at the @xmath10 , @xmath52 and @xmath11 bands are enhanced and dominated by the mgii line and the feii lines on its both sides , especially during its faint state . on the other hand , the fluxes in the @xmath0 ,",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath13 bands are not enhanced by any strong emission lines and are dominated by the emission from the jet .",
    "so the @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 colours become rwb , while the @xmath23 and @xmath26 colours tend bwb , as mentioned at the beginning of this section .",
    "similar convolutions were made between the composite spectrum and the sdss and j - c transmission curves .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ f9 ] . due to the much broader passbands , which lower the flux dominance of the emission lines over the underlying ntc , and the partly overlapping of the adjacent passbands ( see fig .",
    "[ f7 ] , _ right _ ) , the movements of the emission lines on the two maps are not so manifest as in fig .",
    "[ f8 ] , but the overall trends can still be seen . at some redshifts , more than one emission lines",
    "can be included in a same passband .",
    "for example , both the ly@xmath46 and civ lines are included in the sdss @xmath53 band and in the j - c @xmath36 band at a redshift of about 2.40 and 1.45 , respectively , leading to a considerably enhanced fluxes at those two passbands . at the redshift close to 0.6",
    ", the @xmath3-band flux of 3c  345 is enhanced by the flux of mgii line , so its @xmath54 and @xmath55 colours show rwb trends when it is in low state . in the case of 3c  454.3 , which is at a redshift of 0.859",
    ", its @xmath37-band flux is enhanced by the fluxes of the mgii line .",
    "so its @xmath56 and @xmath57 colours show rwb trends when it is in low state .",
    "the simulations clearly illustrate that the strong emssion lines can change the colour behaviours of fsrqs .",
    "previous explanations for the rwb of fsrqs , either by the mgii+bb or by a thermal component , have in fact included the contributions from the strong emission lines of the ly@xmath46 , civ and ciii ] lines .",
    "on the other hand , our simulations focus mainly on the emission lines , whose equivalent widths are usually less than 80  in the rest frame @xcite . for the much broader emission feature , the bb , which can span from less than 1000 to about 4000  , a wavelength range much broader than the fwhm ( @xmath58  ) of a broad - band filter , the simulations can not demonstrate whether it can change the colour behaviours .",
    "however , in the real cases , the broad ( the bb ) and narrow ( the emission lines ) lvefs usually act simultaneously , especially in the @xmath3 and @xmath37 bands at low redshifts .",
    "this will lead to a rwb trend for the @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath59 and @xmath57 colours when the object is in faint state , as in the cases of 3c  345 , 3c  454.3 and pks  1510 - 089 .",
    "the simulations are not conclusive due to the different strengths of the lvefs in different objects . in some objects ,",
    "the lvefs are intrinsically weak .",
    "then the colour behaviour is expected to be bwb .",
    "this is in analogy to the case of bl lac objects .",
    "also , because of the broad passbands of the sdss and j - c filters , there is a good chance for both the blue ( @xmath60 , @xmath53 , @xmath36 and @xmath3 ) and the red passbands ( @xmath61 , @xmath0 , @xmath49 , @xmath37 , @xmath62 and @xmath51 ) to include a strong emission feature .",
    "then whether the object is rwb or bwb will depend on the interplay between the enhancements of the fluxes in the blue and red passbands . the most reliable way to study",
    "the spectral behaviour of fsqrs is to fit the continuum of their spectra .",
    "this will eliminate the impact of the lvefs to the observed fluxes .",
    "most recently , @xcite assembled a sample of 29 fsrqs in the sdss stripe 82 region . by fitting a power - law to the sdss @xmath63 photometric data",
    ", they found only one fsrq showing rwb trend .",
    "this is quite different from previous results @xcite .",
    "the fitting of five photometric data points is somewhat similar to the fitting of the continuum , because the fluxes of the lvefs can not dominate in all five passbands , as can be seen in fig .",
    "so their results on the colour behaviour of fsrqs are more reasonable than the previous results .",
    "we carried out a three - colour monitoring programme on the fsrq , 3c 345 from 2006 february to 2009 june .",
    "there is at least one outburst during this period .",
    "the overall variation amplitude is 2.640 mags in the @xmath0 band .",
    "inovs was observed on two nights .",
    "the bwb and rwb chromatisms were simultaneously detected in this object when using different pairs of passbands to compute the colours .",
    "the bwb chromatism is a shared property with the bl lacs , while the rwb trend is likely due to two lvefs , the mgii line and the blue bump , at short wavelengths .",
    "we made numerical simulations by convolving a composite quasar spectrum with three filter systems .",
    "the results indicate that some other strong but less variable emission lines , such as the ly@xmath46 , civ , ciii ] , h@xmath64+[oiii ] and h@xmath46 lines , in the spectrum of fsrqs may also significantly enhance the measured fluxes of the passbands they are included in , and hence change the colour behaviour of the object .",
    "the emission of bl lac objects is dominated by the beamed ntc from the relativistic jet .",
    "however , the emission from fsrqs should be a combination of the ntc from the jet , the thermal emission from the accretion disc and the line emission from the blr .",
    "the two latter components are collectively name as lvefs in this paper .",
    "the beamed ntc from the jet tends to show bwb chromatism , no matter in bl lacs or fsrqs .",
    "the lvefs in fsrqs can significantly change their colour behaviours , especially when they are in faint state .",
    "the factors that govern the colour behaviour of fsrqs can be summarized as follows .",
    "1 .   the relative strengths of the lvefs and the ntc .",
    "the relative strengths of the two components can be different for different objects , and are related to the brightness states of the objects .",
    "strong lvefs but weak ntc will result in rwb trend , while weak lvefs and strong ntc will lead to in bwb chromatism .",
    "the redshift .",
    "the redshift decides the wavelengths of the observed lvefs .",
    "3 .   the passbands used for colour calculation .",
    "different passbands will include different lvefs .",

    "<S> the colour behaviour of blazars is a subject of much debate . </S>",
    "<S> one argument is that the bl lac objects show bluer - when - brighter chromatism while the flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) display redder - when - brighter trend . </S>",
    "<S> base on a 3.5-year three - colour monitoring programme , we studied the optical variability and colour behaviour of one fsrq , 3c 345 . </S>",
    "<S> there is at least one outburst in this period . </S>",
    "<S> the overall variation amplitude is 2.640 mags in the @xmath0 band . </S>",
    "<S> intra - night variability was observed on two nights . </S>",
    "<S> the bluer - when - brighter and redder - when - brighter chromatisms were simultaneously observed in this object when using different pairs of passbands to compute the colours . </S>",
    "<S> the bluer - when - brighter chromatism is a shared property with the bl lacs , while the redder - when - brighter trend is likely due to two less variable emission features , the mgii line and the blue bump , at short wavelengths . with numerical simulations , </S>",
    "<S> we show that some other strong but less variable emission lines in the spectrum of fsrqs may also significantly alter their colour behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> then the colour behaviour of an fsrq is linked not only to the emission process in the relativistic jet , but also to the redshift , the passbands used for computing the colour and the strengths of the less variable emission features relative to the strength of the non - thermal continuum .    </S>",
