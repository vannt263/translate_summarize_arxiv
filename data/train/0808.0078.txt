    "the widom - rowlinson ( wr ) model @xcite is the simplest model which correctly captures the phenomenology of fluid - fluid demixing for systems interacting via short range forces and is therefore of fundamental importance in the theory of fluids . in particular",
    ", the model undergoes phase separation at sufficiently high density with a critical point which belongs to the ising universality class @xcite .",
    "the model can be regarded as a non - additive hard - sphere mixture in which like species do not interact but unlike species exhibit hard - sphere repulsion with a given collision diameter @xmath1 . although there exist related wr - type models in which only the cross interaction is non - zero we will reserve the term wr model for that with a hard sphere interaction between unlike species .    despite the simplicity of the interactions , an accurate theory of the bulk structure and thermodynamics of the wr model",
    "has proved elusive .",
    "the lowest order mean - field ( mf ) theory @xcite yields a crude description of the pair correlation functions and predicts a phase boundary between @xmath2 and @xmath3-rich phases for which the location of the critical point is in considerable error when compared to recent simulation estimates @xcite .",
    "however , to go beyond the lowest order theory appears to be a very demanding task .",
    "the first attempts at systematic improvement were made by incorporating information from higher order virial coefficients into the theory . in @xcite virial ,",
    "activity and cumulant expansions were considered . in @xcite",
    "the virial series was studied for a wr - type model in which the @xmath4 interaction is that of oriented hard cubes ( chosen to facilitate the calculation of higher order virial coefficients ) . in neither case",
    "was reliable improvement obtained . including additional virial coefficients",
    "was found to yield either results worse than the mf theory or no critical point , due to the appearance of multiple van der waals loops in the free energy .",
    "the origin of these difficulties is the extremely erratic behaviour of the partial sums of the virial series .",
    "this issue was addressed in @xcite in which the virial series of a wr type model with gaussian @xmath4 mayer function was studied .",
    "even though the virial series for this model is much better behaved than for the wr case , pad summation of terms up to 11th order in density was required to locate the critical point with reasonable accuracy .",
    "convergence of the virial series in the neighbourhood of the critical point for the wr model appears to be much slower than for the gaussian version .",
    "although caution should be exercised when drawing conclusions regarding critical behaviour from low density expansions , it seems likely that the critical point of the wr model lies outside the radius of convergence of the virial series .",
    "the correlation functions of the mf approximation in both the two - component and effective one - component versions of the model were studied in ref .  .",
    "the correlation functions were shown to display classical behaviour at the mf critical point and were proven to be exact in the limit of infinitely high dimensionality .",
    "a number of established integral equation theories have also been applied to the wr model @xcite although none were able to account satisfactorily for the structure or phase boundary . of the theories tested only the percus - yevick ( py ) equation displayed a spinodal line , in all other cases ( hypernetted chain , martynov - sarkisov , rogers - young and ballone - pastore - galli - gazzillo equations )",
    "the theory no longer converges in a region of the phase diagram , prior to divergence of the partial structure factors .",
    "although py is the best among the standard theories , it still gives a poor description of the structure and the critical points obtained from the spinodal and virial free energy are highly inconsistent . in order to address these difficulties yethiraj and stell ( ys ) developed an integral equation specifically for the wr model in which analytic expressions are derived for the direct correlation functions between like species @xmath5 and @xmath6 by resumming a class of diagrams which can be evaluated analytically @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the ys equation strongly overestimates the structure and the pair correlation functions do not compare favourably with computer simulation .    in ref .",
    "a fundamental measures density functional was constructed for the wr model suitable for application to inhomogeneous situations .",
    "the theory predicts reasonable behaviour for the pair correlations and improves slightly on the predictions of the mf theory for the phase behaviour .",
    "however , the location of the critical point remains in error and thus does not permit investigation of the structure at statepoints in the vicinity of the simulation critical point . despite all of these efforts",
    "it can be concluded that the overall level of accuracy of the existing theories remains unsatisfactory , given the fundamental nature of the model .    in this work",
    "we seek to develop a theory for the wr model which provides accurate predictions for the pair structure and which is able to locate the critical point to an acceptable level of accuracy . in order to base our approximations on firm foundations we will use simulation results for the pair structure to guide the construction of our theory .",

    "one of the most interesting conclusions arising from this work is that the percus - yevick condition , @xmath45 for all @xmath46 , is satisfied to very high accuracy , even for statepoints approaching the critical point .",
    "however , it is not at all clear whether this property is also maintained off the symmetry line ; the non - trivial cancellations which apparently occur in the diagrammatic expansion of @xmath47 on the symmetry line may no longer hold when @xmath48 .",

    "the increase of the @xmath56 as @xmath57 reflects the tendency of like species to overlap in order to maximize the free - volume and hence the entropy of the system .",
    "equivalently , this clustering behaviour can be viewed as reflecting the attractive ( many - body ) depletion potential acting between spheres of species @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , induced by the sea of non - interacting spheres of species @xmath3 ( @xmath2 ) .",

    "the cross correlation function @xmath62 is negative for all values of @xmath63 and indicates that in addition to the trivial hard core exclusion there is also an effective repulsion between species of opposite type .",
    "this is a consequence of the clustering of like particles and leads to the appealing picture of the bare hard - sphere repulsion between species @xmath2 and @xmath3 being supplemented by a softly repulsive ` dressed ' interaction describing particles shrouded by a cluster of like particles . naturally , this effective interaction is of statistical origin and is therefore not to be taken too literally .",
    "the direct correlation functions are shown in figs.[c_structure1 ] and [ c_structure2 ] . to obtain the @xmath10 from our simulated @xmath11",

    ", we find that the value of @xmath70 does not exceed @xmath73 for any of the simulated statepoints .",
    "a quantity which is often of interest in liquid state integral equation theories are the bridge functions @xmath9 .",
    "the bridge functions for a binary mixture interacting via pair potentials are defined by the relation @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the pair potential acting between species @xmath76 and @xmath77 . in fig .",
    "[ b_structure ] we show the bridge functions obtained from our simulations .",
    "note that data for @xmath9 for @xmath71 are not displayed as these are not required for calculations of the pair structure for systems with hard core interactions , see eq.([bridgefunction ] ) . while the function @xmath78 is of a rather simple form the functions @xmath79 take both positive and negative values .",
    "we now consider the implications of the above for constructing approximate theories .",
    "the most important information to come from the simulations is that the py approximation @xmath80 is satisfied to high accuracy at all of the considered statepoints .",
    "this fully supports and extends the findings of fantoni _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and implies that the condition @xmath80 should be enforced in any approximate theory for this model .",
    "as the exact core condition @xmath81 is also satisfied , this effectively reduces the problem to that of finding accurate approximations for @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we note that our verification of the py condition for the cross correlation functions invalidates the speculation in the discussion of ref .  .",
    "here , it was suggested that a more accurate @xmath82 could be achieved by modeling the tail with a yukawa function and adjusting the free parameters to achieve thermodynamic self consistency .",
    "this program , while successful for the case of hard spheres , would apparently lead to no significant improvement over the simple py approximation for the present model .",
    "the direct correlation functions @xmath69 are of significantly shorter range than the @xmath56 and possess a relatively simple monotonic form .",
    "it may therefore be useful to model the @xmath69 by suitably chosen basis functions of finite range . by choosing finite range basis functions we naturally suppress the development of realistic critical exponents ( the direct correlation functions are known to become long range at the critical point @xcite ) .",
    "however , we do not necessarily restrict ourselves to mean field criticality in making this choice .",
    "the bridge functions between like species @xmath79 are very different from those of the hard sphere system @xcite and exhibit regions of both positive and negative sign .",
    "the function @xmath83 , although superficially similar to the hard sphere bridge function , is found to display a quite different functional form and can not be reasonably fitted using the py bridge function for hard spheres at any effective density .",
    "these findings suggest that modified - hyper - netted - chain ( mhnc ) type approximations @xcite , where universality of the hard - sphere family of bridge functions is assumed , will not prove useful in this case .",
    "indeed , the complex damped oscillatory form of the functions @xmath79 suggests that approaches aiming to directly approximate the bridge functions should be avoided .",
    "the simulation results presented in the previous section indicate that a successful theory for the pair structure of the wr model may be constructed using the conditions @xmath81 , @xmath80 in combination with a suitable `` ansatz '' for the short range functions @xmath69 . in this section",
    "we investigate this possibility .",
    "our desire to identify suitable basis functions to describe @xmath69 leads us to consider a simple virial expansion based density functional approximation .",
    "this yields analytic results for the pair structure which , although only strictly valid at low density , actually give a reasonable account of the structure over the entire phase diagram .",
    "modification of these results to incorporate the core condition leads to a new integral equation closure .",
    "density functional theory ( dft ) is a formalism which enables the calculation of thermodynamic and structural properties of systems subject to spatial inhomogeneity @xcite .",
    "a key result is the stationarity of the grand potential with respect to variations in the inhomogeneous density fields , @xmath84 , where @xmath76 labels the species .",
    "given an explicit functional , this condition yields a set of coupled equations for the @xmath85 .",
    "ideally , approximations within dft are made directly at the level of the free energy , which is a physically intuitive quantity .",
    "correlation functions of all order can then be generated by successive functional differentiation .",
    "this is to be contrasted with standard integral equation approaches for which the closure is usually introduced at the level of the pair correlation functions , and which often make no direct reference to , or guarantee the existence of , an explicit generating functional . in practice ,",
    "the distinction between integral equation and dft approaches is frequently less clear - cut and many approximate dfts rely on correlation functions obtained from integral equation theories as input .",
    "the majority of modern density functional approaches are weighted density approximations in which the inhomogeneous density distributions are smoothed by some physically motivated set of weight functions @xcite . using cluster expansion methods @xcite the exact excess helmholtz",
    "free energy density can be expressed as a power series in the inhomogeneous density fields , @xmath85 . for the wr model , truncation of this series at @xmath86",
    "recovers the original mf theory @xcite .",
    "the only diagram contributing to @xmath87 is the triangle diagram consisting of two root points and a single field point , all connected by mayer bonds .",
    "as the root and field points can not be labelled according to species without either an a - a or b - b mayer bond occuring , the diagram is equal to zero .",
    "the first correction to the mf theory comes from the term @xmath88 , which contains only one diagram . by neglecting terms @xmath89 and higher",
    "we obtain the following simple approximation @xmath90= -\\put(5,3){\\circle*{6}}\\put(8,3){\\line(1,0){11 } } \\put(22,3){\\gray{\\circle*{6 } } } \\hspace{1.1cm}- \\hspace{0.5 cm } \\put(5,12){\\gray{\\circle*{6}}}\\put(8,12){\\line(1,0){11 } } \\put(22,12){\\circle*{6 } } \\put(4.5,-2){\\line(0,1){11}}\\put(5,-5){\\circle*{6 } } \\put(22.,-2){\\line(0,1){11}}\\put(22,-5){\\gray{\\circle*{6 } } } \\put(8,-5){\\line(1,0){11 } } \\label{expansion}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where black and gray field particles are associated with the density fields @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively , and are connected by mayer bonds .",
    "note that the above diagrams are unlabeled . to convert to labeled diagrams",
    "requires multiplication by the appropriate prefactor ( @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) .    at this point",
    "we draw on the experience of previous virial expansion studies of the wr model @xcite and take the truncated expansion ( [ expansion ] ) as the generating functional for our correlation functions , at least to a first level of approximation .",
    "we argue that the above two diagrams contain the dominant structural elements ( basis functions ) for an accurate description of the wr model at all densities .",
    "our reasons for this assertion are the following : ( i ) investigations of the wr virial series suggest that inclusion of higher order diagrams worsens the description of the thermodynamic properties , ( ii ) the pair direct correlations and radial distribution functions generated from the oz route give a reasonable account of existing simulation results at the simulated statepoints ( see below ) , ( iii ) it can be proven that the mf theory becomes exact in the limit of infinite dimension @xcite .",
    "the key part of the proof rests on identification of the four field particle diagram as the numerically dominant correction term to the mf theory .",
    "it should be emphasized that although eq.([expansion ] ) provides a reasonable approximation for the thermodynamic functions over a portion of the phase diagram , the functional ( eq.([expansion ] ) ) is not a good theory for the phase boundary and is not intended as such .",
    "construction of a functional which accurately predicts both the bulk binodal and inhomogeneous structure is a lofty goal which we do not pursue in the present work ( see @xcite for work in this direction ) .",
    "here we present eq.([expansion ] ) as a means to obtain closures at the pair correlation level which may be subsequently modified and improved . the bulk free energy obtained from the uniform density limit of eq.([expansion ] )",
    "is given by @xmath95 the total helmholtz free energy , @xmath96 , displays two van der waals loops as a function of @xmath15 for sufficiently large values of @xmath16 and is thus unable to account for the demixing transition .",
    "+    within dft the bulk pair correlation functions may be obtained using either the test - particle route ( minimizing the functional in the external field due to a particle fixed at the origin ) or the ornstein - zernike ( oz ) route . following the oz route the inhomogeneous pair direct correlation functions are obtained by taking two functional derivatives of the excess free energy functional @xmath97}{\\delta\\rho_i({\\bf r}_1)\\delta\\rho_j({\\bf r}_2)}.\\ ] ] the homogeneous limit is then taken , @xmath98 , and the bulk direct correlation functions are substituted into the oz relations to yield the radial distribution functions . for a binary fluid",
    "the oz relations for the homogeneous fluid are given by @xmath99 where the tilde denotes a fourier transform .",
    "application of this prescription to the functional ( [ expansion ] ) generates the following simple expressions for the bulk direct correlation functions @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the mayer function , @xmath102 for @xmath71 , @xmath103 for @xmath46 , and @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the two lowest order chain diagrams given by @xmath106 and zero otherwise .",
    "[ ozroutecorrelations ] compares the pair correlation functions obtained from eqs.([ozequation])-([c22 ] ) with the simulation results for statepoint @xmath0 .",

    "although the general features of the @xmath10 are captured , the overall level of agreement is less satisfactory than for the @xmath8 .",

    "however , as we are primarily interested in the pair correlations this difficulty is easily resolved by replacing the closed form expression eq.([c12 ] ) for @xmath70 with a relation which enforces the core condition . since our simulation results strongly suggest the approximation @xmath80 , and given that this condition is already satisfied by eq.([c12 ] ) ,",
    "we are led to suggest the following relations @xmath110 combined with the oz relation , eq.([ozequation ] ) , this leads to a closed theory for the pair correlation functions .",

    "we note that by imposing the core condition we are effectively incorporating many more diagrams ( in principle , an infinite number ) into our description of the pair correlations .",
    "the price we pay for going beyond the simple virial approach of ( [ expansion ] ) is that we must resort to fully numerical solution .      as @xmath16",

    "it is a general difficulty of standard numerical methods based on eq.([ozequation ] ) that , upon approaching the critical point , the diverging correlation length renders inadequate methods requiring truncation of @xmath11 at some finite range @xmath116 .",
    "the finite size effects which result from such truncation give rise to considerable difficulties when attempting to numerically assess the critical behaviour of a given integral equation @xcite .",
    "these difficulties have been overcome for one - component fluids and mixtures with additive interactions using specialized algorithms @xcite .",
    "however , these methods do not generalize easily to non - additive mixtures , such as the wr model , and we have thus resorted to more traditional methods of iterative solution @xcite . for this reason we make no definite claims regarding the critical exponents of the present theory ; this would require a detailed study using specially tailored algorithms which goes beyond the scope of the present work . however , the numerical methods we have employed are certainly capable of unambiguous determination of the spinodal line .",
    "this enables us to confirm that the locus of points which we have identified is indeed a true spinodal and not simply a region of non - convergence .",
    "although we refrain from making final claims regarding the nature of the criticality in our equations , we do make the observation that the spinodal is distinctly flatter in the vicinity of the critical point , compared to the mean - field approaches of @xcite or the py theory .",
    "this may indicate interesting non - classical behaviour , and certainly warrants further investigation .",

    "our quasi - grand canonical computer simulations provide the first detailed information regarding the pair structure of the wr model for statepoints off the symmetry line ( @xmath49 ) and provide confirmation that the condition @xmath118 is satisfied to a good level of approximation over the entire one - phase region .",
    "the integral equation here developed is very simple to use and requires no more numerical effort than solving standard integral equations such as py or hnc .",

    "a more sophisticated scheme could involve basis functions with a free parameter , to be determined by enforcing thermodynamic consistency between virial and fluctuation equations of state .",
    "considerable success was achieved in the case of additive hard sphere mixtures by constructing an approximation for @xmath10 using basis functions taken from the low order diagrams in the virial expansion @xcite .",
    "the size of the field particle was treated as a parameter and scaled to interpolate between known low and high density limits .",
    "whether a similar procedure is also feasible for the wr model remains an open question .",
    "following completion of this work we were made aware of a very recent study in which a triplet level integral equation closure was applied to the wr model @xcite .",
    "this approach is significantly more complicated than that followed in the present work but seems to yield very promising results worthy of further investigation .",
    "our numerical solutions of the py equation confirm the classical character of the py critical point for the wr model , in accord with the findings of @xcite .",
    "we note that the py condition @xmath119 allows the binary oz equations to be reduced to a single oz equation of standard form .",
    "an adaptation of the numerical method presented in @xcite can then be applied to study the critical region ."
