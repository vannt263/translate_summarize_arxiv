    "in this paper we consider divergence - free smooth vector fields @xmath1 defined on a domain @xmath0 of @xmath3 containing the origin which may have a singular point at the origin .",
    "we give a definition based on streamline concentration towards the eventual singularity , and we show that if there is sufficient streamline concentration , then the vector field can not be an @xmath4 function .",
    "therefore , this result rules out a certain geometric situation ( streamline concentration ) at a possible singular time for incompressible fluid equations such as the 3d navier - stokes equations . before going any further ,",
    "let us briefly recall a few results about the 3d navier - stokes equations on @xmath5 . the equations ruling the flow of an incompressible viscous fluid on @xmath3 are @xmath6 in which    @xmath7 is a vector - valued function representing the velocity of the fluid , and @xmath8 is the pressure .",
    "the initial value problem of the above equation is endowed with the condition that @xmath9 .",
    "a finite energy _ weak solution _ to the navier - stokes equations over a time interval @xmath10 is a pair @xmath11 satisfying    1 .   equation in the distributional sense , 2 .",

    "weak solutions _ to the navier - stokes equations is due to the pioneer works of j. leray @xcite in the case @xmath16 and e. hopf @xcite in the case of the torus .",
    "moreover , neither the uniqueness nor the global regularity are known .",
    "these questions are the outstanding problems of regularity for solutions to the navier - stokes equations . recall that the space - time singular set @xmath17 of @xmath18 is defined as follows .",
    "a point @xmath19 if there exists a parabolic cylinder @xmath20 about @xmath21 such that the solution @xmath22 .",
    "modern regularity theory for solutions to equation began with the works of prodi @xcite , serrin @xcite , ladyzhenskaya @xcite implying that if @xmath23 then @xmath24 for some @xmath25 and therefore @xmath18 is regular .",
    "later on , m. struwe @xcite extended this to the case ( of scaling invariant pair ) i.e. @xmath26 , and recently this was extended to the limit case @xmath27 by l. escauriaza , g. seregin , and v. sverak ( see their famous work @xcite ) .",
    "after the appearance of the prodi - serrin - ladyzhenskaya criterion , many different regularity cirteria and liouville type theorem of solutions to were established ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we would like to mention a regularity criterion in @xcite by a. vasseur ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "he gave a regularity criterion for solutions @xmath18 to in terms of the integral condition @xmath28 with @xmath29 imposed on the scalar quantity @xmath30 .",
    "note that the case @xmath31 is included .    concerning the analysis of the singular set @xmath17 , we recall the following facts : first , by definition , the set @xmath17 is closed , and thanks to the result of c. foias and r. temam @xcite , the @xmath32-dimensional hausdorff measure of the set of singular times @xmath33 is zero . next , v. scheffer @xcite and then l. caffarelli ,",
    "r. kohn and l. nirenberg @xcite showed the best result concerning _ partial regularity _ of _ suitable weak _ solutions of the navier - stokes equations stating that the parabolic one - dimensional hausdorff measure of @xmath17 is zero .",
    "finally , a consequence of the latter result is a bound on the spatial singular set for each time slice @xmath34 which has at most one - dimensional hausdorff measure .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the vector field at a possible singular time @xmath35 , and examine the geometry of its streamlines . recall that in @xcite , c - h .",
    "chan and the third author proposed a possible scenario for an isolated space singularity at a possible blow - up time by using the energy inequality and regularity criterions especially @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they constructed a divergence free velocity field @xmath18 within a _ streamtube _ segment with increasing twisting ( i.e. , increasing swirl ) .",
    "the construction of such a vector field @xmath18 demonstrates the way in which _ excessive _ increase of twisting of streamlines can result in the _ blow up _ of the quantities @xmath36 ( for some @xmath37 ) and @xmath38 while at the same time preserving the finite energy property @xmath39 of the fluid .",
    "note that the increasing swirl streamtube is not included in the sufficient concentration streamlines case .",
    "the device of streamtube has already proposed as the vortex - tube ( see@xcite ) .",
    "+ in this work , we show that if  enough \" streamlines of a smooth and divergence free vector field concentrate towards a possible isolated singular point , then the vector field can not be an @xmath4 function . the main idea is to costruct an appropriate  streamline flux tube \" and apply stokes theorem .",

    "let @xmath44 be the open ball with radius @xmath45 centered at the origin .",
    "the above definition excludes the streamlines entering the ball @xmath44 infinitely many times before entering @xmath48 . if it happens and a streamline enters @xmath44 finitely many times before getting into @xmath48 , then one can re - parametrize the time so that its last entrance occurs at time @xmath49 .",

    "@xmath110 is injective , which follows from uniqueness of solutions and from the fact that for each @xmath59 , @xmath111 for @xmath55 . from these properties",
    "it can be shown that @xmath112 .",
    "piecewise smoothness of @xmath64 then follows from the piecewise smoothness of @xmath113 and smoothness of solutions to the vector field .",
