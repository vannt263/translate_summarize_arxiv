    "quantum phase transition ( qpt ) is a very interesting phenomenon in many - body quantum systems.@xcite compared with the classical phase transitions driven by thermodynamic fluctuation , qpts occur at zero temperature , thus the thermodynamic fluctuation is absent . in fact , qpts are driven by the so - called quantum fluctuation . for a quantum system described by a hamiltonian @xmath0 with @xmath1 the tuning parameter , the ground - state property ( i.e. the ground - state energy ) of @xmath0 may show qualitative change at some point @xmath2 , then a qpt occurs .",
    "most qpts , such as various magnetization transitions in spin models,@xcite can be investigated by traditional order parameters .",
    "it needs mention that , some exotic qpts , such as the topological qpt,@xcite can not be described by local order parameters .    in the vicinity of the qpt point",
    ", long - range correlations would develop in the ground state .",
    "thus it is expected that quantum correlation plays a central role in the qpts.@xcite quantum entanglement is the most famous measure of quantum correlation . for various models , it has been found that the entanglement is singular in the vicinity of the qpt points , which is usually related to the singularity of the ground - state energy at the qpts.@xcite nonlocality is another aspect of quantum correlation , and can be indicated by the violation of bell inequalities , such as the famous bell - clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality.@xcite for a long time , nonlocality and entanglement were regarded as identical . in fact , for pure two - qubit states , it has been proved rigorously by gisin that the two are indeed equivalent.@xcite however , for mixed states , it s found that an entangled state may not violate any bell inequality , i.e. , an entangled state is not necessarily a non - local state.@xcite thus , nonlocality and entanglement turn out to be two different aspects of quantum correlation .",
    "quite recently , it has been found that the bell - chsh function ( bcf ) , which is associated with the bell - chsh inequality , can serve as a useful qpt detector , even for topological qpt@xcite and kosterlitz - thouless qpt@xcite .",
    "it should point out that a complete understanding about the features of bcf in detecting qpts has not yet been reached .    in this work",
    ", we make a further step by considering an exotic type of qpts occurring in the so - called matrix product states(mpss).@xcite in this kind of qpts , the ground - state energy remains analytic in the entire parameter space , thus the situation is different from traditional qpts.@xcite in order to distinguish them from traditional qpts , we usually call them mps - qpts . the mpss have always provided a valuable test - bed for understanding the features of various qpt detectors , including quantum entanglement,@xcite quantum discord@xcite and quantum fidelity@xcite . in this work",
    ", we investigate the ability of bcf to detect qpts by considering mps models .",
    "firstly , as we will show , several typical mpss display clearly the features of bcf in detecting qpts . secondly , mpss help us understand the role of quantum correlation , quantum entanglement , and nonlocality in qpts .",
    "bell - chsh inequality is the simplest nontrivial bell inequality .",
    "first , let s define the chsh operator as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 , with @xmath6 and @xmath7 unit vectors and @xmath8 .",
    "then for any realistic and local two - qubit state @xmath9 , the bell - chsh inequality reads @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 depends upon the vectors @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and one can optimize @xmath11 over all vectors @xmath6 and @xmath7 to get the maximum value @xmath12.@xcite we will refer to @xmath13 as the bell - chsh function ( bcf ) in this work . for some state @xmath9 , if it turns out that @xmath14 , we usually say that the bell - chsh inequality is violated , which means that the state @xmath9 can not be described by a realistic local theory , in other words , it is non - local .",
    "alternatively , it s found by horodeckis that for any two - qubit state @xmath15 bcf can be expressed by a closed analytical formula.@xcite for convenience , here we use two works @xmath16 and @xmath17 to denote the elements of @xmath9 , and for all the models considered in this work , it holds that @xmath18 . to calculate bcf ,",
    "one first defines a @xmath19 matrix @xmath20 as @xmath21 $ ] , with @xmath22 the pauli matrices .",
    "then the bcf is given by @xmath23 , with @xmath24 and @xmath25 the two largest eigenvalues of the symmetric matrix @xmath26 .    in order to understand the features of nonlocality",
    ", we will compare it to two closely related measures for bipartite correlation , i.e. , entanglement concurrence@xcite and quantum discord@xcite .",
    "concurrence describes the entanglement between two spins .",
    "let s denote @xmath27 as the spin - flipped matrix for the two - qubit density matrix @xmath9 , i.e. , @xmath28 , then the concurrence is given by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 are the square roots of the eigenvalues of @xmath31 in decreasing order . for separable states ( in other words , unentangled states ) , the concurrence would vanish , and for maximum entangled states , the concurrence is @xmath32 .",
    "nonlocality and entanglement are two aspects of quantum correlation .",
    "recently , quantum discord is proposed to characterize all the quantum correlation present in the system.@xcite its definition is based on two quantum versions of the classical correlation . for a classical system @xmath33 composed of two subsystems @xmath34 and @xmath35 ,",
    "the total correlation can be expressed as @xmath36 , or alternatively , @xmath37 , with @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 the shannon entropy , and @xmath41 the conditional entropy . @xmath42 and @xmath43 are equal to each other , however , their quantum versions are found to be non - equivalent from each other , and the difference is used to define the quantum discord . by replacing the shannon entropy and the conditional entropy with the von neumann entropy and quantum conditional entropy , respectively , @xmath42 becomes the quantum mutual information @xmath44 and the quantum extension of @xmath43 turns out to be the classical correlation @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is just a complete set of projectors.@xcite finally , discord is just defined as the difference between @xmath47 and @xmath48 , i.e. , @xmath49 for a state containing quantum correlation , discord is generally non - zero , while for classical states , @xmath47 and @xmath48 would just reduce to @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively , thus the discord vanishes .    from the above descriptions",
    ", one can see that the entanglement concurrence and quantum discord would simply be zero in separable states and classical states , respectively.@xcite as we will show in the next section , bcf can capture the signal of qpts in these two situations .",
    "in this section , we firstly give a brief introduction to mpss , then we investigate the bcf and nonlocality at mps - qpts in several typical models .",
    "an mps containing @xmath50 sites ( or cells ) is defined in the following matrix product form@xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 are @xmath53 matrices , @xmath54 labels the sites , and @xmath55 denoting the degree of freedom for site @xmath56 .",
    "the matrices @xmath57 depend on the parameter @xmath1 . usually , for low - dimensional quantum systems , it is difficult to express the ground - state wavefunction exactly in an explicit form .",
    "however , for an mps @xmath58 , one can construct a parent hamiltonian @xmath0 , which guarantees the state @xmath58 be the ground state of @xmath0 .",
    "more importantly , in the thermodynamic limit @xmath59 , as the change of @xmath1 , the ground state @xmath58 may undergo a novel type of transition , such that local observables are singular and the correlation length is divergent , with the ground - state energy keeping analytic ( in traditional qpts , the ground - state energy would be singular.)@xcite .",
    "we usually say that the system undergoes an mps - qpt .    for a given mps ,",
    "the reduced density matrix of any subsystem in the system can be obtained with the help of transfer matrix technique.@xcite first , let s define the transfer matrix @xmath60 as @xmath61 then the reduced density matrix of @xmath62 adjacent sites is given by @xmath63}{\\textrm{tr}(\\hat{e}^{n})}.\\label{eq : rho_general}\\ ] ]    one can further prove that , for two - site correlation , the correlation length is given by @xmath64 , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the first and the second largest eigenvalue of the transfer matrix @xmath60 .",

    "( [ eq : rho_general ] ) to obtain the reduced density matrix for the concerned two - site subsystem of the models .",
    "then we determine the bcf , and research the behavior of bcf , concurrence and discord in the mps - qpts .      as the first example",
    ", we consider an mps with @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69.@xcite its parent hamiltonian describes a spin @xmath70 ladder model with so(2 ) symmetry .",

    "quantum discord is defined on the classical - quantum paradigm from a measurement perspective , thus it captures all the quantumness of correlation in the system . for classical states , discord is zero thus loses it function as a qpt indicator .",
    "this is just the situation for @xmath115 with @xmath116 in the three - body interaction model . on the other hand ,",
    "quantum entanglement is defined on the separability - entanglement paradigm . for quantum separable states ,",

    "now we clarify the drawback of bcf .",
    "first of all , for a general state , the calculation of bcf is difficult , which greatly limits its application .",
    "in addition , as shown in @xmath77 of fig . [",
    "fig : ladder ] and @xmath108 of fig .",
    "[ fig : three_1 ] , the mathematical definition of bcf can introduce non - physical singularity , which is not related to the singularity in @xmath120 . as a result",
    ", the singularity of bcf just can be used to detect , rather than to determine , an mps - qpt .",
    "however , we d like to mention that both the concurrence and the discord have similar disadvantage ( see fig . [",
    "fig : ladder ] as examples ) , which has already been discussed in some other studies.@xcite    let s discuss the form of quantum correlation in the mps - qpts of these models . in this work ,",
    "we have only dealt with bipartite correlations .",
    "we use the discord to identify the existence of quantum correlation , and then describe the nature of quantum correlation through the analysis of entanglement and nonlocality . in the vicinity of mps - qpt point in the ladder model ,",
    "the quantum correlation in @xmath74 is in the form of both entanglement and nonlocality . in the three - body interaction model , for @xmath93 ,",
    "the quantum correlation is in the form of entanglement without nonlocality , while for @xmath96 with @xmath116 , the quantum correlation , if exist , is neither in the form of entanglement nor nonlocality . in the xyz interaction model , for any two spins in the chain ,",
    "the quantum correlation is neither in the form of entanglement nor nonlocality . from one hand ,",
    "our results show that when mps - qpts occur , the two - site quantum correlation can show very rich nature combined with entanglement and nonlocality . from another hand",
    ", it reveals that entanglement and nonlocality are not the only aspects of quantum correlation , and there exists some kind of quantum correlation which can not be characterized by entanglement , nor by nonlocality .    finally , as we have shown in this work , the bell - chsh inequality is violated just in the qpt of the four - body interaction ladder model .",
    "in fact , as far as we know , in all the previous works , @xcite when qpts occur in infinite models , the density matrices of two - qubit subsystems never violate the bell - chsh inequality .",
    "thus , the ladder model reported in this work may be the first one to present such a behavior . in qpts in many - body systems , as an important aspect of quantum correlation , nonlocality should play a central role , however , it turns out that bipartite nonlocality is not a common form of quantum correlation present in these one - dimensional systems .",

    ", we believe mps models would be very useful to study this important issue .    after finishing this manuscript",
