    "in this contribution , we investigate the properties of adaptive time - frequency systems that generalize classical gabor systems . although some of the presented results apply in a more general setting , the focus is on time - frequency systems with compactly supported generators .",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath1 . the corresponding _ gabor system _",
    "@xcite @xmath2 is the set of functions @xmath3 the prototype function @xmath4 is also called _ window _ or _",
    "generator function_. of particular interest are systems that allow for stable , perfect reconstruction of any function @xmath5 from the system coefficients , given by inner products with the system elements .",
    "such systems are generally called _ frames _  @xcite or , when they are of the form @xmath2 , _",
    "gabor frames_. for any frame , there exists a possibly non - unique _ dual frame _ that enables the aforementioned perfect reconstruction .",
    "gabor frames @xmath2 possess the nice property that , due to their highly structured nature , the existence of a dual frame with the same structure , @xmath6 for some @xmath7 , is guaranteed .",
    "this inheritance of structure from the original frame by a dual frame does not hold for more general frames and is one of the reasons why gabor frames are so convenient to work with .",
    "one such dual frame is the _ canonical dual _",
    ", obtained by applying the inverse _ frame operator _ , cf . section [ sec : prelims ] for details , to the frame elements .",
    "one of the early and most prevalent results in the field is the theory of painless non - orthogonal expansions  @xcite , where the authors determine a simple necessary and sufficient condition for gabor frames @xmath2 with compactly supported generator and dense frequency sampling , i.e. small frequency step @xmath8 , to constitute a frame .",
    "then , the frame operator is diagonal and thus easily inverted and the canonical dual generator @xmath9 has the same support as @xmath4 .",
    "this setting is often referred to as the _ painless case_.    in applications , frames generated from compactly supported window functions are of particular interest , because they allow for the most efficient computation of the frame coefficients and reconstruction .",
    "compact support of the frame generators is also crucial for real - time implementation .",
    "thus , the investigation of such frames beyond the painless case is an active field , see e.g. @xcite and @xcite . in the latter two articles , christensen , kim and kim",
    "prove that for any gabor frame with @xmath10 $ ] , @xmath11 and @xmath121/2,1[$ ] , there exists a dual gabor frame generated by a window supported on some compact set dependent only on the magnitude of @xmath8 , cf .",
    "* theorem 2.1 , lemma 3.2 ) .",
    "in fact , they show in @xcite that the support condition in @xcite can be further improved , for a large class of window functions @xmath4 .",
    "this is also reflected in our own results in section [ sec : regcas ] albeit recovering only a special case of the results in @xcite .",
    "the results in this manuscript are somewhat complementary to those of christensen , kim and kim . to allow for a comparison , we recall some results from @xcite in section [ sec : regcas ] .",
    "more results on the support of dual gabor frames are due to grchenig and stckler  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 9 ) .",
    "they prove the existence of dual frames with compactly supported , piecewise continuous generator for @xmath2 with @xmath4 a totally positive function of finite type . while the class of functions treated by grchenig and stckler is quite different from the compactly supported functions in this contribution , the support size of the dual generator grows proportionally to the quotient @xmath13 in both cases .",
    "+ although gabor systems possess a number of useful mathematical properties , that lead to a deep , yet accessible theory , the fixed time - frequency resolution and sampling strategy they provide is often debated as too restrictive for practical purposes . as a result ,",
    "various generalizations have been proposed , to provide more flexible sampling strategies or varying window functions .",
    "methods that allow for prefect reconstruction with flexible sampling and varying windows are scarce , however .",
    "one construction that unites these desirable properties are _ nonstationary gabor _ ( nsg ) systems , first proposed by jaillet  @xcite .",
    "while classical gabor systems are constructed from regular translations and modulations , nsg systems are generated by a countable set of window functions and modulations thereof .",
    "explicitly , we associate a sequence of pairs @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , with the set of functions @xmath17 if @xmath18 constitutes a frame , we call it a _ nonstationary gabor frame_. note that a nonstationary gabor system with @xmath19 and @xmath20 for all @xmath21 with @xmath0 and @xmath1 is a gabor system .    nonstationary gabor frames combine the adaptivity of _ local fourier bases _  @xcite with the flexibility of redundant systems to provide a powerful framework for time - frequency representations . much like gabor frames give rise to _ wilson bases _",
    "@xcite , local fourier bases can be constructed from nsg frames , although the more intricate properties of their relationship have yet to be investigated .",
    "state of the art results on _ nonstationary gabor frames _ are collected in @xcite , where an extension of the painless case to nonstationary gabor systems is also given .",
    "the young theory of nonstationary gabor frames beyond the painless case is currently being developed  @xcite , while the painless construction is being used in realizing various time- or frequency - adaptive transforms  @xcite .",
    "+ note that , in contrast to regular gabor frames , the existence of a dual frame with the same structure , i.e. comprised of window functions @xmath22 and modulation parameters @xmath23 , is not guaranteed for general nsg frames .",
    "indeed , one of the central results in this manuscript details the structure of the canonical dual system under certain restrictions .",
    "these restrictions , concerning the support and overlap of the window functions @xmath24 and the modulation parameters @xmath23 , guarantee compact support for the elements of the canonical dual frame and a certain modulation and phase shift structure , detailed in section [ sec : nsgrap ] .",
    "this structure can be deduced from that of the inverse frame operator , which is in turn determined using the walnut representation of the nsg frame operator and the neumann series representation of its inverse .",
    "further , we obtain a duality condition , sufficient for pairs of dual nonstationary gabor systems @xmath18 and @xmath25 to constitute dual frames . under weak assumptions on @xmath24 and @xmath23 , we are able to show equivalence of this condition with duality of @xmath18 and @xmath25 . for a fixed nsg frame @xmath18 , these equations might not be solvable , i.e. a dual system of the form @xmath25 may not even exist .",
    "we determine a simple , yet somewhat restrictive , condition on @xmath18 , such that the duality conditions are solvable .",
    "our results apply to the classical gabor case by choosing @xmath19 and @xmath20 to describe the support of the canonical dual window @xmath9 in the setting considered in @xcite and @xcite , complementing the results therein . by restricting the duality conditions for nsg systems in that way",
    ", we recover the famous duality conditions for gabor systems  @xcite and a simple special case of a result in @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : prelims ] introduces the basic concepts and notation used , while section [ sec : walnutlike ] introduces the walnut representation of the nonstationary gabor frame operator and related concepts . in section [ sec : regcas ] , we state our results for the regular gabor case and compare them to the results of christensen , kim and kim  @xcite .",
    "section [ sec : nsgrap ] presents our results in their general form for nonstationary gabor frames .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm : mainres ] is postponed to section [ sec : prodis ] due to its lengthy nature .",
    "section [ sec : conclu ] concludes the paper with a summary of the results and an outlook .",
    "before we state our results , some basic notions have to be clarified .",
    "in particular , we work with certain structured time - frequency dictionaries and the corresponding frame - related operators . by @xmath26",
    "we denote the @xmath27-norm and by @xmath28 the operator norm .",
    "furthermore we use the restriction @xmath29 of @xmath5 to the interval @xmath30 , the characteristic function @xmath31 of the set @xmath32 and the open @xmath33-ball @xmath34 around @xmath35 with radius @xmath36 . the essential support ,",
    "i.e. the support up to sets of measure zero , of @xmath5 is denoted by @xmath37 , the lebesgue measure of a set @xmath32 by @xmath38 .",
    "finally , we use the sign function @xmath39 .",
    "let @xmath40 , with a countable index set @xmath41 , be a system of generator functions .",

    "the basic operators associated to frames are the analysis and synthesis operators @xmath46 and @xmath47 defined by @xmath48 for all @xmath49 . for two systems @xmath50 and @xmath51 with the same index set @xmath41 , the mutual _ frame - type operator _",

    "analysis , synthesis and frame operators are well - defined for systems @xmath44 violating the upper and/or lower frame condition , but no longer bounded above or below , respectively .",

    "<S> moreover , we determine a sufficient condition for a pair of nonstationary gabor frames to form dual frames . </S>",
    "<S> the equivalence of this condition to the duality of the involved systems is shown under some weak restrictions . </S>",
    "<S> it is then applied in a simple setup , to prove the existence of dual pairs of nonstationary gabor systems with non - diagonal frame operator . </S>",
    "<S> a discussion of the results , restricted to the classical case of regular gabor systems , precedes the statement of the general results . here </S>",
    "<S> , we also explore a connection to recent work of christensen , kim and kim on gabor frames with compactly supported window function .    </S>",
