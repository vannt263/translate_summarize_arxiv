    "experimental data have hinted at several anomalies in @xmath2 decays induced by the flavour - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) process @xmath18 . in 2013 , lhcb measured four observables related to the angular distribution of @xmath19 in six bins of dimuon invariant mass squared , @xmath20 , and found a deviation at the @xmath21 level from the standard model ( sm ) in one of them  @xcite .",
    "lhcb also measured the rates for the @xmath22 decay  @xcite , finding values slightly below the sm expectations . recently , with finer binning , lhcb confirmed their earlier anomaly in the angular distribution of @xmath19 decay  @xcite .",
    "in addition , lhcb has studied other modes induced by the @xmath23 transition as well , namely , the @xmath24 decay  @xcite and also @xmath25 in the @xmath26 decay  @xcite with results consistent with the sm .",
    "a particularly interesting discrepancy between experiment and the sm is in the ratio @xmath27 of the branching fraction of @xmath28 to that of @xmath29 .",
    "lepton - universality in the sm predicts @xmath27 to be very close to 1 . yet",
    "lhcb found @xmath30  @xcite for the dilepton invariant mass squared range of @xmath31 gev@xmath32 .",
    "this disagreement occurs only at the @xmath33 level , but would be extremely interesting if confirmed .",
    "as expected , the anomalies in the @xmath18 measurements have received considerable attention in the literature @xcite and several models have been put forward as possible new physics explanations  @xcite .",
    "it has also been argued that more careful treatment of long distance physics would eliminate most of these anomalies , as done most recently in ref .",
    "models have also been put forth attempting to explain the apparent lepton non - universality observed in @xmath27 @xcite . a recent analysis of these experimental results",
    "is that of ref .",
    "@xcite , where global fits of the observables in terms of new physics parametrised by deviations from the sm values of certain wilson coefficients are presented .",
    "this model - independent analysis and its results are the starting point of our discussions .    in this paper we will focus our discussion around the scenario in which new physics affects primarily the @xmath34 and @xmath35 wilson coefficients , which has been found in ref .",
    "@xcite to significantly improve the agreement between the measurements and the theoretical predictions .",
    "we recall that these coefficients appear in the low - energy effective hamiltonian responsible for @xmath18 transitions as follows : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and , in the absence of flavour universality , @xmath38 can have different values for different lepton flavours .    within the sm , @xmath38",
    "are approximately the same for all leptons with @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "to reduce the tension in the global fit associated with the @xmath13 anomalies , the new physics contribution @xmath41 is required to be of order @xmath42 and for scenarios where @xmath43 is also not zero , the best fit occurs for @xmath44  @xcite . to address the anomaly in the value of @xmath27",
    ", the absolute value of @xmath45 is required to be larger than that of @xmath46 .",
    "when going beyond the sm , additional operators with different chiral structures that contribute to @xmath1 can also be generated , such as @xmath47 and @xmath48 , where @xmath49 .",
    "for the remaining of this paper , we will neglect this possibility and concentrate on a scenario with modified @xmath50 only , corresponding to a particular @xmath6 interpretation of the anomalies .",
    "this particular interpretation is motivated by the possibility of lepton non - universality hinted at by @xmath27 , and its occurrence in non - universal @xmath6 models that single out the third generation .    a common extension of the sm that produces",
    "tree - level fcnc s is a @xmath6 boson , particularly when it is non - universal in generations .",
    "this new interaction can have different types of chiral structures in both quark and lepton sectors . a model that singles out",
    "the third generation with an additional right - handed interaction  @xcite leads to tree - level fcnc s for @xmath51 which , according to the global fits of ref .",
    "@xcite , do not help much in addressing the observed anomalies . at one - loop level",
    ", it is possible to produce the pattern @xmath52 which is disfavoured by the data on @xmath53 . in this context , a model that more naturally fits the @xmath50 scenario is one where the @xmath54 gauge group in the sm is extended to be generation - dependent  @xcite , an example of which has been dubbed ` top - flavour ' before  @xcite .",
    "the model has the @xmath0 gauge symmetry , where @xmath3 governs the left - handed fermions in the first two light generations and @xmath4 governs those in the third heavy generation .",
    "this model has been studied before by two of us in ref .",
    "it affects the @xmath1 process at tree level mostly through modifications to @xmath50 .",
    "the relevant parameters are severely constrained by @xmath10-@xmath11 mixing .",
    "nevertheless , the model can still produce values of @xmath55 in the right ranges to improve the global fits as described in ref .",
    "in addition , the model can break lepton universality and lepton number , accommodating @xmath27 and predicting sizeable branching ratios for @xmath56 , @xmath16 and an enhancement of @xmath17 with respect to its sm value .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : fcnc ] , we review the tree - level fcnc s induced by the @xmath5 and @xmath6 exchanges in the model , deriving the basis for the latter analyses . in section  [ sec : bsll ] , we compute the corrections to the wilson coefficients @xmath57 occurring in this model . in section  [ sec : numbers ] , we update the global fit to the electroweak precision data and the @xmath10-@xmath11 mixing constraint , thereby obtaining preferred ranges of the theory parameters . the results",
    "are then used to evaluate @xmath55 numerically and to check against the preferred values presented in ref .",
