    "pulsars are employed as precision timing tools , due to the stability of their emission and of their rotation .",
    "the average radio pulse shape ( known as the pulse profile ) has traditionally been thought to remain steady over decades , and extreme rotational stability results from the high angular momentum of a rapidly spinning , dense star .",
    "pulsar stability exists even in the presence of nulling and mode - changing : short - term emission variations that were first observed soon after the discovery of pulsars @xcite .",
    "these discontinuous changes occur on time - scales ranging from a few pulse periods to hours and days @xcite .",
    "mode - changing pulsars switch between two or more quasi - stable states , while nulling is thought to be an extreme form of mode - changing , with one state showing no or low emission .",
    "these effects aside , the pulse profile has long been considered a stable characteristic of each pulsar .",
    "the last decade , however , has witnessed a number of counter - examples to this perceived stability .",
    "+ a small , emerging population of radio pulsars have shown pulse profile changes on time - scales of months to years ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these changes are often accompanied by _ timing noise _ , a term given to the unexplained , systematic deviation from the modelled rotational behaviour of a pulsar , often seen in younger pulsars . although common , the causes of timing noise are poorly understood .",
    "one possibility is that timing noise is due ( at least in part ) to unmodelled variability in the spin - frequency derivative or",

    "+ any unmodelled variability is detrimental to experiments that rely on precision pulsar timing , such as the search for gravitational waves using pulsar timing arrays .",
    "the observed correlation between timing and pulse profile variability suggests that this information may be used to improve the precision of pulsar timing experiments .",
    "in addition , it is revealing a new type of phenomenology that may hold information on the interiors and environments of pulsars .",
    "+ in this work we make the assumption that all unmodelled timing variations can be attributed to changes in @xmath0 . under this assumption",
    "we investigate the pulse profile and timing variability in a large number of pulsars to identify any correlation .",
    "we have analysed data from 168 pulsars that have been monitored for up to eight years by the parkes radio telescope .",
    "these objects represent a population of young , energetic pulsars , known to show the most timing noise , thus offering possibilities to test the above hypothesis .",
    "the only exception is psr  j0738@xmath14042 , which is monitored due to its known variable behaviour @xcite .",
    "we present nine interesting examples of pulsar variability in this paper , including psr  j0738@xmath14042 and two pulsars previously studied in @xcite . + in section 2",
    ", we detail the observations .",
    "section 3 describes the data analysis techniques used to detect both emission and rotational variability .",
    "the results from nine pulsars are presented in section 4 , followed by a discussion and conclusions in sections 5 and 6 respectively .",
    "since 2007 , 168 pulsars have been observed on a roughly monthly basis at 1369 mhz with the parkes radio telescope and the multibeam receiver as part of the fermi timing programme @xcite .",
    "the data were recorded with one of the parkes digital filterbank systems ( pdfb1/2/3/4 ) with a total bandwidth of 256 mhz in 1024 frequency channels .",
    "radio frequency interference was removed using median - filtering in the frequency domain and then manually excising bad sub - integrations .",
    "flux densities have been calibrated by comparison to the continuum radio source 3c 218 .",
    "the data were then polarization - calibrated for both differential gain and phase , and for cross coupling of the receiver . the mem method based on long observations of 0437 - 4715",
    "was used to correct for cross coupling @xcite .",
    "flux calibrations from hydra a were used to further correct the bandpass . after this calibration",
    ", profiles were formed of total intensity ( stokes parameter i ) , and averaged over time and frequency .",
    "the profiles were cross - correlated with templates with a high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) to obtain times of arrival ( toas ) , using standard techniques for pulsar timing @xcite .",
    "the template used to calculate the toas is noiseless , generated iteratively from a set of von mises functions in order to represent the profile , formed from the summation of all observations .",
    "the objective of the data analysis is to model the variability of pulse profiles that have been sampled at irregular intervals , and compute the @xmath0 timeseries for each pulsar .",
    "we have developed a technique that models the pulse profile data as a function of time , allowing us to interpolate between the epochs of observation .",
    "this builds on work by @xcite .",
    "this process also allows better visualisation of sparsely sampled data .",
    "irregular sampling again raises difficulties in the calculation of @xmath0 , which we have also addressed using similar inference techniques .",
    "these techniques are based on gaussian process ( gp ) non - parametric modelling , details of which are provided in the following .",
    "we use the term _ variability map _ to describe an interpolated plot that maps the differences ( i.e. the _ profile residuals _ ) between the pulse profile at each observation and a constant model .",
    "the model is taken to be the median of all observed profiles in a dataset .",
    "panels a and b of figure  [ 0738_map ] are examples of variability maps . before",
    "the observed pulse profiles can be compared with the constant model , we process them to ensure the off - pulse baseline is centred on zero .",
    "some observations are considered unreliable and excluded from further analysis .",
    "a pulse profile is excluded using the following empirical rule which has been found to perform well in rejecting spurious observations : if the standard deviation of the off - pulse region is greater than a factor of two larger than the median value taken from the off - pulse regions across all epochs .",
    "observations are also removed manually if they show extreme and isolated profile deviations that can likely be attributed to instrumental failure .",
    "+ all pulse profiles originally consist of 1024 phase bins across the pulse period .",
    "if s / n is low for any pulsar then pulse profile variations can become difficult to detect . in cases where the profile with the highest s / n in a pulsar dataset has a peak value less than 20 times the standard deviation of the off - pulse noise ,",
    "the s / n is increased by reducing the number of phase bins to 128 .",
    "the individual profiles are aligned by cross - correlation with the median over all epochs . using the timing information to align the profiles",
    "is not possible , given the amount of timing noise in the data .",
    "aligning the profiles is essential for the modelling that follows , as the timeseries of each pulse phase bin is modelled independently . in the few observations where large profile deviations occur ,",
    "it is possible that the alignment may be slightly biased in that direction , however , all observations have been individually inspected to exclude the possibility that this effect plays an important role .",
    "+ we use variability maps to monitor two types of profile variability : changes in the flux density across the whole pulse profile , and changes in the relative flux density of profile components , i.e. shape variations . in this paper , we primarily focus on the latter , as large flux density variations are observed in most of the pulsar data analysed in this work , and are thought to be primarily attributable to the effects of refractive scintillation . to uncover the less common pulse profile shape changes",
    ", we normalise all observations by the mean on - pulse flux density . +",
    "two median profiles were calculated for each pulsar dataset : one for the normalised data described above and one for the non - normalised , flux calibrated data .",
    "the relevant median profile was then subtracted from each observation , leaving the profile residual ( following * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for each of the pulse profile phase bins ,",
    "we compute a gp regression model that best describes the profile residuals , which we observe to often have sharp turnover features .",
    "the covariance function chosen for this analysis , therefore , employs a kernel from the matern class : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the gamma function , @xmath4 is a modified bessel function , d is the distance @xmath5 between any two epochs ( training points ) , @xmath6 is the maximum allowable covariance , and @xmath7 is the characteristic lengthscale , i.e. a parameter which reflects how significantly the distance between @xmath8 and @xmath9 affects @xmath10 .",
    "the positive covariance parameter @xmath11 was chosen to be 3/2 to provide a level of smoothness and flexibility to the covariance function that is suitable for the kind of trends we are trying to model : @xmath12    this matern covariance kernel was combined with a white noise kernel @xmath13 to model the uncertainty in the profile data , where @xmath14 is the kronecker delta function and @xmath15 is the standard deviation of the noise term in the model .",
    "the choice of hyperparameters @xmath16 ( @xmath17 , @xmath7 , @xmath15 ) for the covariance function employed by the gp , is made by maximising log @xmath18 . in this process",
    "we constrain the lengthscale @xmath7 between 30 and 300 days , which we find to result in the models best representing the data .",
    "the gp takes the training points ( the observed data ; @xmath8 and corresponding @xmath19 ) and calculates test points , i.e. the most likely value @xmath20 for any value @xmath21 , and its variance : @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a covariance matrix with components @xmath10 over all training points , @xmath25 is a matrix which reflects covariance between a test point and the training points and has components @xmath26 .",
    "the covariance of a test point @xmath27 . + a gp regression model is produced for all phase bins , with test points computed at one day intervals .",
    "these models are then combined to produce a continuous variability map , which highlights deviations across the pulse profile and across the data span ( e.g. panels a and b of figure  [ 0738_map ] ) .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we are testing the hypothesis that all unmodelled variations in pulsar timing can be explained as time - variable changes in @xmath0 . in order to calculate a time variable @xmath0",
    ", we use the _ timing residuals _ , which are the differences between observed pulse toas and a timing model with a constant set of parameters ( e.g. pulse period , period derivative , position , proper motion ) .",
    "the model is optimised by using a least - squares - fitting procedure to minimize the timing residuals .",
    "+ in the case of a pulsar with time variable @xmath0 , a timing model with constant parameters will result in systematic timing residuals .",
    "@xcite describe how the second derivative of these timing residuals represents a @xmath0 term that is additional to the timing model .",
    "we have developed a new technique which employs gp regression to analytically model the timing residuals , allowing us to produce a continuous function representing @xmath0 for each pulsar .",
    "the keith et al .",
    "calculation is based on the interpolation technique of @xcite , who use a generalised wiener filter as a maximum likelihood estimator for pulsar timing residuals .",
    "this technique can be considered a special case of our fully bayesian inference method . while the deng et al .",
    "technique provides a means to smoothly interpolate between residuals , it does not provide uncertainties for the interpolated data .",
    "this makes it non - trivial to obtain useful uncertainty estimates of the derivative values of a model produced by maximum likelihood estimation ; keith et al .",
    "find the second derivative of their timing residual interpolation by numerically differentiating twice .",
    "in contrast , gaussian process regression allows us to analytically model the second derivative directly from the timing residuals , with associated fully bayesian error estimation .",
    "gp regression does not require regularly evenly sampled data .",
    "+ for this technique , we use a squared exponential covariance kernel because it is infinitely differentiable : @xmath28 along with the white noise kernel .",
    "when observing how well the gp model and optimised covariance hyperparameters @xmath16 fit to the timing residuals , however , we noticed that one kernel was not always sufficient to describe them . adding a second squared exponential kernel to the covariance function models the timing residuals more accurately in all but two of the nine pulsars detailed in this work .",
    "as an example , figures [ 1kern ] and [ 2kern ] show the timing residuals of psr  j0940@xmath15428 fitted with a gp using one and two kernels respectively .",
    "the discrepancies between the data and the model are also shown .",
    "the error bars in the lower panel represent @xmath29 , the uncertainty in the toa measurement .",
    "it is clear that the single kernel model in figure [ 1kern ] systematically deviates from the toa measurements , whereas the same panel of figure [ 2kern ] reveals a near perfect fit .",
    "+ to calculate @xmath0 , we optimised the hyperparameters @xmath16 , as described in section [ varmaps ] . whether the covariance function contains one or two kernels , the value of each lengthscale was restricted to between 30 and 1000 days ; all other parameters were unbounded .",
    "the optimised covariance hyperparameters @xmath16 were then carried forward to calculate the second derivative of the gp regression model of the timing residuals ; following @xcite , the second derivative of a gp model can be estimated using the second derivative of the covariance kernel . in the case of the squared exponential kernel : @xmath30 the second derivative of the gp model : @xmath31 the value of @xmath0 can trivially be shown to be : @xmath32 + the variance of this method is given by : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the diagonal terms of @xmath35 , which gives : @xmath36 in the case of one covariance kernel .",
    "when plotting the @xmath0 model , test points were calculated only for days on which the pulsar was observed .",
    "+            [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have developed a new technique for measuring @xmath0 by employing gp regression to model the second derivative of the timing residuals .",
    "the uncertainty of our @xmath0 values is small because the gp regression prediction at any point is informed by many neighbouring data points ( the extent of which is dependent on the covariance parameters ) .",
    "as described in section [ rotvar ] , our techniques provide fully bayesian error estimation , which is not the case when timing residuals are modelled using a maximum likelihood estimator . additionally , the method is analytical , in contrast to previous techniques , in which @xmath0 is numerically calculated from the information within the span of a small window .",
    "+ when fitting a non - parametric function to the timing residuals , all but two of the nine pulsars featured in this paper were best fit by a covariance function that contained two squared exponential kernels plus a noise model .",
    "table  [ gpparam ] shows the optimised covariance parameters when fitting the timing residuals with one and with two kernels in the covariance function . where the data is best fit by two kernels , this suggests that at least two physical processes are responsible for the timing noise that we observe .",
    "+ using the above technique to measure @xmath0 , along with our method to map pulse profile shape changes , we have been able to reproduce the quasi - periodic variability already observed in psr  j0742@xmath12422 @xcite and psr  j1830@xmath11059 @xcite . + a very useful property of a gp ,",
    "is that it can combine derivative and integral observations .",
    "if , in the future , we are able to successfully use pulse profile variability as a proxy to calculate @xmath0 values , these data can be easily combined with timing residuals in further gp regression .",
    "the above techniques have also uncovered a striking new example of correlated @xmath0 and profile shape variability in psr  j1602@xmath15100 .",
    "this pulsar exhibits a dramatic change in profile shape over @xmath37 600 days , with a simultaneous reduction in @xmath0 .",
    "such sudden and dramatic changes have previously been attributed to exterior material entering the pulsar magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "the reconfiguration in current within the magnetosphere , induced by the introduction of external material , would simultaneously affect the braking torque and hence @xmath0 .",
    "the value of @xmath0 of psr  j1602@xmath15100 is observed to decrease with the appearance of a new profile component .",
    "this is comparable to the 2005 event seen in psr  j0738@xmath14042 , hypothesised to be caused by an asteroid encounter @xcite .",
    "the changes observed in psr  j0738@xmath14042 have persisted , whereas psr  j1602@xmath15100 returned to its previous state after @xmath37 600 days .",
    "the change in @xmath0 over this period can be approximated as a step - function , and interpreted as a reduction in the total outflowing plasma above the polar caps .",
    "the magnitude of the current change can be inferred from the change in @xmath0 following @xcite .",
    "the difference between the pre- and post - step @xmath0 values corresponds to a reduction in the charge density @xmath38 of @xmath39 c @xmath40 , where @xmath41 , the moment of inertia @xmath42 is taken to be 10@xmath43 g @xmath44 , the magnetic field @xmath45 g , polar cap radius @xmath46 and where the neutron star radius @xmath47 is taken to be @xmath48 cm .",
    "we can relate the difference in charge density associated with the two @xmath0 states to mass supplied to the pulsar , by multiplying it by the speed of light , the polar cap area and the duration of the new spindown state . over 600 days ( the duration of the dramatic profile and @xmath0 changes )",
    ", this amounts to @xmath49  g , which lies within the range of known solar system asteroid masses , and is consistent with the mass range of asteroids around neutron stars proposed by @xcite .",
    "the present interpretation of the correlated long - term variations observed in emission and rotation , involves charged particle currents in the pulsar magnetosphere @xcite ; distinct pulsar states can be explained by differing levels of magnetospheric plasma . changing plasma levels",
    "are expected to modify both the material outflow along open field lines at the polar cap , and the subsequent emission produced .",
    "plasma variations would also vary the braking torque on the pulsar , and we would expect to see a change in @xmath0 accompanying any significant change in emission . the correlated variability that has been previously observed in pulse profiles and rotation are , therefore , evidence of intrinsic processes . + in this paper , we have demonstrated that pulse profile shape can be shown to correlate with @xmath0 , although the relationship does not appear to be simple . of the nine pulsars analysed in this paper ,",
    "seven show significant changes in pulse profile shape to various degrees and on various time - scales . of those ,",
    "five also show some degree of @xmath0 variation that could be considered correlated .",
    "it is particularly interesting that no change in @xmath0 is seen to accompany the dramatic profile shape change seen in psr  j0738@xmath14042 .",
    "+ when interpreting these results , we must consider the possibility that the relationship beween @xmath0 and pulse profile variability is more complex than anticipated and/or that the relationship is simple , but that we are unable to accurately record the variability involved . when analysing the rotational variations , for example , we have made the hypothesis that timing noise is due to changes in the braking torque on the pulsar , observable as changes in @xmath0 .",
    "other possible sources of timing noise are , inadequate calibration of the raw observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and failure to correct for variations in the interstellar dispersion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "with regard to the pulse profile variability analysis , the simulation described in section  [ others ] demonstrates that trends that persist over multiple observations can be detected by the techniques described in this work , providing they have a magnitude above @xmath37 two times the level of the observation noise .",
    "therefore , profile faint variability that also has a short time - scale will often go undetected . additionally , when testing the correlation between the variability of flux density in individual ( or small groups of ) pulse phase bins and the spindown rate , we acknowledge that the latter is measured much more accurately than the former . longer observation times would , in general , produce more stable pulse profiles and allow extraordinary deviations to be more easily identified .",
    "the standard deviation of the mean profile is proportional to 1/@xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the number of pulses it includes . as each pulsar has a different rotational period , and has observations of varying length , the degree of their profile stability",
    "is also expected to be different .",
    "figure  [ rotvsdev ] plots the average number of rotations in an observation against the maximum amount of deviation in the pulse profile .",
    "it is interesting to note that most of the pulsars featured in this paper follow the expected trend , with the stark exception being psr  j0738@xmath14042 ; sections of the pulse profile clearly remain unstable since the dramatic changes undergone in 2005 .",
    "psr  j0742@xmath12822 and psr  j0908@xmath14913 also show substantially more deviation than that expected from their average observation length .",
    "we have shown that changes in the shape of the pulse profile can be accompanied by changes in its mean flux density .",
    "this is seen most clearly in psr  j1830@xmath11059 , in which the narrow emission state has a mean flux density around 1.4 times larger than the wide state .",
    "in other words , the flux density of the leading edge component and of the peak are in anti - correlation . such anti - correlation ( and correlation )",
    "is also seen in other pulsars , most notably psr  j0738@xmath14042 and psr  j1602@xmath15100 . + for psr  j1830@xmath11059 , it is possible to predict the spindown rate from the radio flux density received from the pulsar . in this respect",
    ", parallels can be drawn between the behaviour of psr  j1830@xmath11059 and that of the intermittent pulsars ; both have two states in which higher emission is coupled to more rapid spindown .",
    "+ the relationship between pulse profile shape and mean flux density can not be easily investigated in most pulsars , because large variations in pulse profile flux density , due to refractive scintillation , are ubiquitous ; the pulse profile varies as a whole , and its shape is maintained .",
    "for some pulsars , these flux density variations are coherent over multiple observations , i.e. , on a time - scale of hundreds of days .",
    "as these variations are thought to be primarily due to effects of propagation , we expect , and find , that pulse profile flux density and @xmath0 are not well correlated in general .",
    "it is for this reason that the correlation maps produced in this work show the relationship between the normalised pulse profiles and @xmath0 .",
    "it should be noted that the nature of the normalisation process itself can result in some apparent anti - correlation between different phases of the pulse profile .",
    "+ when considering the changing shape of a pulse profile , it is noteworthy that throughout the normalised flux density plots in this paper , we see varying levels of deviation across the pulse profile . for example , the standard deviation in one leading edge component of psr  j0738@xmath14042 is @xmath37 63 times larger than the mean standard deviation seen across the off - pulse phase bins ( panels a and b of figure  [ 0738_profile ] ) .",
    "this is in contrast to other sections of the profile that show much less deviation .",
    "further investigation of single pulses would elucidate the differing levels of deviation across a pulse profile .",
    "this fact also offers the opportunity to improve pulsar timing by preferentially employing the most stable sections of the pulse profile when performing template matching .",
    "we have analysed 168 pulsar datasets , each spanning up to eight years in length , and presented results from nine pulsars .",
    "we have employed gp regression as part of new analysis techniques in order to model pulse profile variability .",
    "simulations have shown that this is most easily detected if the profile deviations occur over multiple observations and have a magnitude at least twice the level of the observational noise . +",
    "gp regression was also used to infer @xmath0 under the assumption that all timing noise is the result of unmodelled changes in @xmath0 .",
    "our variability detection techniques have accurately reproduced known pulsar variability , and also discovered some clear new examples .",
    "the most notable new variability was found in psr  j1602@xmath15100 ; dramatic pulse profile changes along with a @xmath37 5% rise and fall in @xmath0 occur simultaneously over a @xmath37 600 day span .",
    "+ the correlation between @xmath0 and changes in pulse profile shape is clear in some pulsars , but not in others .",
    "we must consider that one or more of the following is true : ( i ) the intrinsic relationship between @xmath0 and pulse profile variability is possibly more complex than has been postulated previously .",
    "( ii ) our ability to detect pulse profile variability is often insufficient to show the underlying correlation with @xmath0 . (",
    "iii ) our hypothesis that unmodelled changes in @xmath0 are primarily responsible for timing noise , may be invalid .",
    "problems regarding the detection of pulse profile variability will be mitigated by more sensitive instruments and longer integration times .",
    "+ finally , we have observed a strong relationship between the shape changes of psr  j1830@xmath11059 and its mean flux density , both of which are correlated with @xmath0 .",
    "one pulse profile shape has a mean flux density around 1.4 times that of the other , meaning that the monitoring of either the profile shape or the mean flux density would permit the removal of most of the timing noise in this pulsar .",
