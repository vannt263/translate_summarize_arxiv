    "first , @xmath5 is self - affine : the portions of the graph above the intervals @xmath56 $ ] , @xmath57 $ ] and @xmath58 $ ] are affine images of the whole graph , contracted horizontally by @xmath31 and vertically by @xmath8 , @xmath59 and @xmath8 , respectively , with the middle one also being reflected vertically when @xmath7 . as a result",
    ", the box - counting dimension of the graph of @xmath5 follows from example 11.4 in @xcite .",
    "it is @xmath10 if @xmath6 , and @xmath60 if @xmath7 .",
    "( although the middle part of the graph is contracted more strongly in the vertical direction than in the horizontal direction when @xmath61 , the formula given in @xcite is nonetheless applicable since the affine maps do not include shears . )",
    "this result was also obtained by mccollum @xcite , who claims the same value for the hausdorff dimension of the graph .",
    "unfortunately , his proof is incorrect .",
    "mccollum attempts to apply the mass distribution principle , and seems to use the mass distribution that assigns to each  basic rectangle \" a measure proportional to its height .",
    "but he then appears to incorrectly assume that within each basic rectangle the mass is uniformly distributed .",
    "in fact , the hausdorff dimension of the graph of @xmath5 seems rather more difficult to determine than the box - counting dimension , and it would not be surprising if the two dimensions were different for certain values of @xmath8 .",
    "second , a very interesting paper by seuret @xcite shows how @xmath5 can be expressed as the composition of a monofractal function and an increasing function , and also computes the multifractal spectrum of @xmath5 .    in recent years",
    ", there has been a great deal of interest in the non - differentiability sets of singular functions .",
    "much of the research concerns two main classes of functions : cantor - like functions , whose points of increase form a lebesgue - null set , on the one hand ; and strictly increasing singular functions on the other .",
    "following @xcite , let us call functions in the former class  ordinary devil s staircases \" , and functions in the latter class  slippery devil s staircases \" . in most cases ,",
    "formulas are given for the hausdorff dimension of the sets @xmath62 and @xmath63 of points where the function @xmath64 in question has , respectively , an infinite derivative , or neither a finite nor an infinite derivative .",
    "for the class of ordinary devil s staircases , this work was begun by darst @xcite , who showed for @xmath64 the classical cantor function ( @xmath28 in our notation ) that @xmath65 .",
    "successive generalizations were obtained by darst @xcite , falconer @xcite , kessebhmer and stratmann @xcite , and , most recently , troscheit @xcite .",
    "slippery devil s staircases were examined by jordan et al .",
    "@xcite and kessebhmer and stratmann @xcite , among others .",
    "qualitatively , the results in the above papers suggest the following dichotomy : @xmath66 for ordinary devil s staircases , while @xmath67 for slippery devil s staircases .",
    "this is illustrated by okamoto s functions @xmath5 , which , for @xmath45 , belong to the family of conjugacies of interval maps considered in @xcite .",
