    "with its first observation , integral @xcite began a collection of highly absorbed sources , some of which may represent a new class of binary ( see @xcite for a review ; k05 hereafter ) .",
    "igrj16318 - 4848 was a bright x - ray source with extreme absorption that would later be shown to have bright x - ray emission lines .",
    "since then , the integral galactic plane survey has discovered several more similar sources , suggesting that these objects form a new class of x - ray binary , characterized by high absorption columns , slow spin periods and occasional bright x - ray outbursts .",
    "the first integral catalog @xcite notes 28 unidentified sources from the integral galactic plane survey , ten of which have been followed up at x - ray and optical wavelengths and have been shown to belong to this new source class .    nearly simultaneously to the discovery of this potentially new class of source by integral , the _ swift _ bat galactic plane survey began to uncover many new sources from its own survey .",
    "it was speculated , due to their absence from previous soft x - ray surveys , that some of these sources may be highly absorbed binaries , possibly members of the new class of integral binaries .",
    "several objects identified in the first integral catalog , as of fall 2006 , remained without significant follow - up in the x - ray or at other wavelengths . during the suzaku cycle 1",
    "call for proposals , we proposed to follow - up three integral detected sources that were suspected to be members of the new class but had yet to be studied in detail .",
    "we proposed , furthermore , to observe two newly identified sources from the bat galactic plane survey to determine whether they were also members of this new source class .    in this paper",
    ", we detail the analysis of the suzaku data collected on these sources , discuss the likelihood that these sources are similar to the originally discovered igr sources and briefly discuss the possible nature of the new class .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  2 we describe the observations and data analysis ; in  3 we present our results ; in  4 we discuss the similarity of each source and the propriety of calling each a member of the igr source class and discuss the potential nature of these sources ; in  5 we summarize our results and conclusions .",
    "observations of the five targets , three integral sources and two additional sources from the bat galactic plane survey , were conducted between april 12 and october 31 , 2006 ( see table 1 ) . on four of the five targets ,",
    "a single observation was collected while on one source two observations were collected , separated by @xmath06 months .",
    "all sources were observed using the hxd aimpoint and with the xis instruments in normal imaging mode .",
    "one of the sources ( swj1010.1 - 5747 ) was found to be a symbiotic star and these observations were published in @xcite ; this source will not be discussed further here .",
    "data from the four other targets were reduced using the standard suzaku processing software , xisrmfgen version 2007 - 05 - 14 and xissimarfgen version 2007 - 09 - 22 and the other standard analysis tools contained in headas version 6.4 .",
    "point source processing was carried out as described in the suzaku abc data reduction guide . in processing the data from the hxd instrument , which is a non - focused instrument , it was discovered that the observation of igrj16465 - 4507 was contaminated by the nearby bright x - ray source gx340 + 0 . as a result",
    "the hxd instrument data for this source have not been used .",
    "the hxd data of the other sources were checked for contamination by nearby bright sources but none was found .",
    "data from the xis0 , xis2 and xis3 front illuminated instruments were combined together while data from the xis1 back illuminated instrument were kept separate .",
    "data from the combined front illuminated instruments , from the back illuminated instrument and from the hxd pin ( except in the case of igrj16465 - 4507 ) were then fit simultaneously in xspec ( version 12.4.0 ) .",
    "data from the xis instruments were binned to have a minimum of 50 events per bin .",
    "data from the hxd instruments were binned to have a minimum of 100 events per bin .",
    "the xronos timing analysis software version 5.21 was used to search for periodicity in the data . in cases where significant temporal structure was found in the data ( either periodicity or transient outbursts ) ,",
    "time - separated spectral analysis was done to search for spectral variation .",

    "the bat data are well fit by the same model derived from fitting the suzaku data alone .",
    "this implies that the snapshot captured in the suzaku observations of these 2 sources is representative of the overall source behavior and shows that the partial covering scenario is supported to energies as high as 200kev . in the case of igrj16195 - 4945 ,",
    "the bat data are not well fit to the same spectrum as the total suzaku observation , nor to any of the segmented spectra shown in table 5 .",
    "since the total suzaku observation does not match the bat data , we can infer that flares such as that seen in the suzaku data do not dominate the flux from the source .",
    "since the bat data are also not well fit by the spectrum seen in the suzaku quiescent data ( the bat data fit a softer spectrum than any segment of the suzaku data and have a higher intensity than the quiescent segment but lower intensity than the post - flare segment ) , we can also infer that the quiescent state is not best representative of this source .",
    "since the post - flare state is also a poor fit to the bat data , we infer that the source spends more time in the quiescent state than is seen in the suzaku observation , but that flares such as that seen in the suzaku data are somewhat common ( since the quiescent state does not match the bat data ) .",

    "the data segmentation separates the period prior to the flare ( quiescence ) from the flare itself ( flare ) and from the period after the giant flare has decayed to near the original level ( post - flare ) .",
    "the definition of the quiescent period is clear due to an extended gap in the data ( 20ks ) prior to the onset of the giant flare .",

    "this definition ensures that the flare segment is dominated by flare emission even if some small amount of  post - flare  emission is included .",
    "it also ensures that the post - flare data are sufficient to produce an accurate spectrum .",

    "suggest that such outbursts are actually longer lived than the previously generally observed duration of hours , lasting instead for several days @xcite .",
    "since our data coverage ends @xmath030  ks after the flare onset , we can not rule out that an elevated level of emission continues for several days after the initial flare , though the brightest emission appears to last for only @xmath01 hour in our data .",
    "if we assume the equatorial disk wind model to be applicable to this source , however , we can estimate the orbital period of the binary as follows .",
    "we assume that the three broad states seen in the suzaku observation ( quiescent , post - flare and total flare ) approximately represent the full range of states of igrj16195 - 495 and thus we can write the following relationship between the flux of the 3 suzaku states and the orbit - averaged flux level seen by bat :    @xmath79    where a is the flux level of the suzaku quiescent state observation and a@xmath80 is the fraction of the orbit spent in this state , b is the flux level of the suzaku post - flare state observation and b@xmath80 is the fraction of the orbit spent in this state , c is the flux level of the suzaku total flare state observation and c@xmath80 is the fraction of the orbit spent in this state and d is the ( orbit averaged ) flux of the bat observation .",
    "if we now make the assumption that the bright flare seen in the suzaku data ( the total flare state ) represents the entry of the compact object into an equatorial disk wind from the donor star , we must interpret the subsequent post - flare state as the longer lived period of moderate flaring behavior that accompanies the remainder of the journey of the compact object through the disk wind .",
    "according to the @xcite observation of swiftj11215 - 5952 , this longer lived period of activity can last for up to @xmath05 days . assuming a similar duration for this phase in igrj16195 - 4945",
    ", we have b@xmath814.3e5/p and c@xmath815e3/p and a@xmath82 where p is the period of the binary in seconds .",
    "thus equation ( 1 ) becomes :    @xmath83    to estimate the flux levels a , b , c and d , we fit each corresponding dataset using the average spectral fit to the complete dataset ( including the bat data ) and determined the associated flux level in the 15 - 150  kev band .",

    "this period is unusually short compared to other measured sfxt periods @xcite .",
    "even if we alter our calculation to interpret the on state ( see tables 4 - 5 ) as the measure of the flux during the passage through the disk wind rather than weighting it heavily to the post - flare state as shown above , the predicted period only increases by a factor of @xmath02 , which is still well below the more typically reported sfxt orbital periods of @xmath85200 days .",
    "an orbital period of @xmath016 days , however , is consistent with previous measurements of orbital periods associated with highly absorbed igr sources @xcite .",
    "we are pursuing further observations to followup this predicted orbital period .",
    "if the predicted period is shown to be accurate , igrj16195 - 4945 may represent an important cross - over source between the known sfxts with orbital periods of hundreds of days with periodic flaring behavior and the new class of highly absorbed integral sources , which have much shorter orbital periods but are without clear observations of periodic flaring behavior .",
    "such a cross - over object would suggest a common mechanism at work for the emission seen from hmxbs of widely varying orbital parameters .",
    "it would also suggest a useful method of refining the period search for such sources in instances where a single flare has been observed but large amounts of observatory time are not available for a dedicated follow - up monitoring campaign .",
    "a long - term monitoring campaign of this source would be very useful to determine the true duration of the associated outbursts .",
    "igrj16493 - 4843 is a variable source with a high column density and non - periodic variations , also potentially qualifying it with this new source class .",
    "finally , igrj16465 - 4507 presents the fewest similarities to previous observations of the class , but part of the discrepancy may be due to the narrow energy window in which our observations are made for this source .",
    "we note that we do not see periodic variability in this source as previously reported by others @xcite .",
    "one of the interesting results of this work is that two of the four sources in our sample ( igrj16465 - 4507 and swiftj2000.6 + 3210 ) appear to be transient pulsars .",
    "it would be very interesting to know if this is a common characteristic of all sources in this new class .",
    "if so , it would imply that elliptical orbits are common in these sources .",
    "since it has been shown , however , that binaries will circularize rapidly ( 10@xmath86 - 10@xmath87 years ) through tidal dissipation following the supernova detonation of the more massive star @xcite , the occurrence of highly elliptical orbits , if found to be common in these sources , will require explanation . as a rough estimate of the fraction of sources that may be expected to be in highly elliptical orbits ,",
    "we may proceed from work showing that the companion source in several of these systems is a supergiant o or b star @xcite .",
    "this implies that the hmxb phase of the lifetime of the system ( the time after the detonation of the more massive star and prior to the detonation of the less massive star ) will be typically 5 - 10@xmath410@xmath87 years .",
    "therefore , at most 10 - 20% of the observed sources should be found in strongly elliptical orbits . finding a significantly higher fraction of highly elliptical orbits would suggest another mechanism at work during the hmxb evolution .",
    "possible explanations for the lower circularization rate include generally wide orbital separation of the binaries , unusually large initial supernova kicks , and capture events or other gravitational interactions that may amplify eccentricity of the system .",
    "it has been shown by @xcite that the ellipticity of visual binaries is roughly a function of the mass of the primary and the orbital period of the system , with tidal dissipation responsible for rapid circularization of systems with orbital periods less than about 10 days .",
    "since the same mechanism of tidal dissipation is thought to be responsible for the circularization of x - ray binary orbits , it seems reasonable to assume that a similar function applies to hmxbs .",
    "measuring both the ellipticity of the orbit and the period for a sample of these systems through a monitoring campaign will allow us to test whether this hypothesis is true , and thus will indicate whether tidal dissipation is the dominant effect in hmxb circularization .",
    "monitoring would also determine orbital periods of each system , a necessary step toward determining the orbital characteristics of the system and ultimately the mass of the compact object , and would allow a more in - depth analysis of spectral variability as a function of orbital phase . since the neutron stars in these binaries likely orbit only a few stellar radii from the companion and are believed to have orbital periods on the order of ten days , daily or perhaps bi - weekly observations for about a month",
    "seem sufficient to accurately determine all of these characteristics .",
    "the _ swift _ satellite offers the capability to perform such monitoring and , with its simultaneous x - ray and optical observations , would provide an ideal platform for future observations .",
    "finally , monitoring on long timescales ( covering a baseline of several years ) will allow investigation of the spin - up / spin - down of the pulsar which can shed light on the magnetic field strength of the pulsar as well as the wind environment in which it is embedded ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "three of the four sources in our sample are confidently associated with ob stars from optical spectroscopy @xcite . in the case of igrj16915 - 4945",
    ", a foreground dwarf star has thwarted attempts to identify the secondary .",
    "igrj16915 - 4945 has a history of x - ray outbursts , however , which are a trait of sfxts that contain ob secondary stars @xcite .",
    "thus association with a massive star seems likely for this system as well .",
    "since the companion stars in these sources are most likely o or b stars , an interesting potential application of these data is to study the porosity or clump size of the absorbing material in the winds of massive stars .",
    "though the periodic variability and extremely bright outbursts seen in some of the data can not be explained by variations in the column density along the line of the sight to the observer in classic hmxbs , stochastic variations of lower contrast , which are also seen in the data , are a potential signature of variable obscuration .",
    "we have searched for variations in column density ( assuming all other spectral parameters remain constant as a simplifying approximation ) during the aperiodic pulses seen in some of the data but do not find any to within the uncertainty of the data .",
    "we point out , however , that typical fluences in the pulses analyzed are @xmath141000 photons , leading to weak constraints on the column density . while some of these sources have prior observations with xmm - newton",
    ", whose greater effective area will reduce the uncertainty in these measurements , the exposures are extremely short ( 3 - 4 ks ) and thus are not able to constrain column density variations on timescales of 5 - 10 ks as seen in these data .",
    "longer observations of these sources with xmm - newton would be useful in this regard and would offer the additional benefit of high resolution soft x - ray spectroscopy to probe the ionization state of the wind through metal line strengths .",
    "@xcite have investigated the size of clumps in the accreting wind of sfxts and determined typical masses of 10@xmath8 - 10@xmath5  g and mass loss rates of 10@xmath88 - 10@xmath89 m@xmath90/yr from analysis of integral data .",
    "integral data do not constrain n@xmath78 , however , and thus can not distinguish between variability due to changing column density levels and that due to changing accretion levels .",
    "xmm - newton observations at 0.2 - 10.0  kev will be able to distinguish between these two variability mechanisms .",
    "the limits on the fe line equivalent widths ( ews ) found in these sources are low for sources of such high n@xmath78 column density @xcite . such low fe line ews",
    "imply either an intrinsically low fe abundance relative to n@xmath78 ( as has been seen in extragalactic sources , e.g. , centaurus a @xcite ) or that the fe fluorescence covering fraction is less than 1 . if the high n@xmath78 column density absorber is local to the compact object , as has been suggested through comparisons between x - ray and optical absorption measures ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and if the fe fluorescence originates in a shell structure surrounding the compact object , it is difficult to envision a geometry in which the coverage would be less than 4@xmath2 .",
    "the fe emission may originate in the inner region of the accretion disk , however , in which case a lower covering fraction may be reasonable .",
    "furthermore , there are reasons to believe that the assumptions inherent in relating x - ray and optical absorption measures may not be valid for all sources @xcite , and thus the disagreement between x - ray and optical absorption measures may not necessarily imply that the high column absorber is local to the compact object . alternatively , such low fe ews might also be considered as evidence of the presence of adc emission .",
    "the presence of an adc seems unlikely , however , given the lack of other emission lines from 1 - 5 kev that are usually produced in adcs .",
    "still other explanations for low fe ews are similar to those discussed by @xcite in reference to cen a and include the fe fluorescence source being displaced from the x - ray continuum source or the presence of an attenuating obstruction between the x - ray source and the site of the fe fluorescence . while our data argue against ( but do not rule out ) the low covering fraction scenario , the intrinsically low fe ews scenario requires non - trivial assumptions about the geometry of the system .",
    "further observations , particularly phase - resolved spectroscopy , will be very helpful in disentangling these many potential explanations and are encouraged .",
    "our primary goal in this study is to determine whether these four sources exhibit similar characteristics to the emerging new class of highly absorbed igr sghmxb or sfxt sources .",
    "the defining characteristics of this new class are i ) high absorption column ( @xmath911@xmath410@xmath5  @xmath6 ) , ii ) periodicity on timescales of a few to @xmath0100 minutes , generally interpreted as a neutron star spin period , iii ) periodicity on timescales of @xmath010 days , generally interpreted as a binary orbital period and iv ) occasionally strong x - ray emission lines .",
    "* i ) * in all four sources the total absorbing column is @xmath851@xmath410@xmath5  @xmath6 . generally , we do not see significant changes in the absorption over the duration of the observations . while this is not surprising during a single day - long observation , which probably samples a small segment of the orbital phase",
    ", it is somewhat surprising that two observations of swj20006.+3210 , separated by more than six months ( and furthermore apparently at different parts of the orbital phase ) also show no significant difference in  .",
    "a dramatic increase in absorbing column is seen in igr16195 - 4945 for a duration of @xmath030  ks , during a bright outburst ( when all parameters are left free to vary ) . since this dramatic increase in",
    "is associated with a dramatic increase in flux , one might interpret this as an increase in emission due to interaction of the neutron star with a density enhancement .",
    "such a scenario might be expected due to the passage of the neutron star through a thick disk associated with the donor star . since an interpretation in which  is approximately constant and only @xmath3 varies",
    "also produces adequate spectral fits , an alternative model in which the increased emission is due to variable accretion is also possible .",
    "* ii ) * in swj2000.6 + 3210 , we see a period of 1056  s which is only observed during one of two observations of the source . this is a newly identified transient x - ray pulsar .",
    "given the low magnetic field implied by the relatively slow rotation period of 1056  s , it is not surprising that the same mechanism that produces periodic observations near periastron is too weak to produce an observable period near apoastron where the wind density will be lower .",
    "* iii ) * due to the short nature of the observations ( generally @xmath01 day ) , we do not expect to directly measure orbital periods , previously reported to be on the order of ten days in other sghmxbs and , indeed , we do not . during observations of the one source for which we have",
    "well separated observations we also do not see evidence of an orbital period .",
    "we have , however , used our observations to calculate a predicted orbital period for igrj16195 - 4945 .",
    "assuming that igrj16195 - 4945 is a sfxt and that the bright flare we see signals the interaction of the compact object with an equatorial wind of the donor star , we have combined our suzaku observations with long - term _ swift_-bat observations to predict the orbital period for this source as p@xmath016 days .",
    "this is unusually short compared to previously measured sfxt orbital periods , but is consistent with orbital periods previously measured for the highly absorbed igr sources .",
    "more consistent monitoring , perhaps using the _ swift _ satellite , would be very useful in confirming or refuting this predicted period and in characterizing the orbital periods of these highly absorbed binaries in general .    *",
    "iv ) * we find only weak evidence of fe fluorescence emission in one source , and only upper limits to fe lines in the other three sources .",
    "this is similar to the behavior reported in the original integral highly absorbed x - ray binary sources @xcite in which only 1 of 10 sources showed strong emission lines while the others showed only weak lines or upper limits .",
    "the fe line measurements that we report here are either the first for the source in the literature ( igrj16465 - 4507 , igrj16493 - 4348 , swiftj2000.6 + 3210 ) or several times more restrictive than previous measurements ( igrj16195 - 4945 ) .",
    "moreover , our measurements are similarly or more restrictive than those reported on similar sources in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while none of these sources is ruled out from the igr class based on these observations , further observations would be helpful in refining their nature .",
    "of particular value would be periodic monitoring of all four systems .",
    "we are grateful to hans krimm and gerry skinner for providing access to and help in analyzing the bat survey data and to fotis gavril for help in the timing analysis studies .",
