    "we posit that any ( possibly unbounded ) operator which conserves total particle number @xmath73 and can be written in normal order can necessarily be written as sums of terms looking like @xmath74 . to consider bounded operators which conserve total particle number , we may equivalently assume @xmath74 is of the form @xmath75 , where @xmath58 is the many - body vacuum state corresponding to zero mass .",

    "this sum can be rewritten as @xmath90 where @xmath91 .",
    "we note that the above sum is finite : from the triangle inequality , @xmath92 , we can bound the absolute value of the numerator by @xmath93 , which is independent of @xmath94 .",
    "hence the sum above is absolutely convergent , and is bounded in magnitude by the sum , @xmath95 which is finite in three dimensions .",

    "the integral @xmath110 is therefore larger than @xmath111 hence for a particle of mass @xmath13 in a spatial superposition of distance @xmath112 , we should observe a spatial dephasing rate on the order of at least @xmath113 .",
    "we remark that this result is similar , at short distances , to the result of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the decoherence rate for a particle separated by one distance of ` measurement ' uncertainty goes as @xmath114 .",
    "we can already constrain such dephasing by considering interference of large molecules as described in refs .",
    "@xcite . to do so",
    ", we treat the center of mass of each molecule as the effective position coordinate of the particles in our theory .",

    "this treatment is valid if , over the timescale of the experiment , this coordinate does not strongly interact with other ( internal or environmental ) degrees of freedom .",
    "our assumption is supported , _ a fortiori _ , from the fact that interference is observed in the experiment . for a mass of @xmath116 amu , a spatial superposition @xmath117 m at the second diffraction grating ( set by the standing wave length scale ) , and an observed coherence time @xmath118 ms , we find that @xmath119 m. this is 16 orders of magnitude larger than the planck length , or about 100 gev , a substantially lower energy scale than expected for gravitational physics to emerge .",
    "having established that restricting potential communication via gravity to being classical would cause a mass superposition to dephase , we next consider what happens in the case of a large object composed of many particles .",
    "although a detailed description requires the addition of other forces and particle species , for simplicity we focus on the consequences of including @xmath71 of equation [ e : l ] in the general equation of motion . towards this end we will consider the evolution of the particles momentum , which requires understanding how ` hopping ' terms in the discrete variable representation evolve under the super - operator @xmath71 .    to start , we look at the evolution of @xmath120 , for @xmath99 : l_(a_j^a_i ) = -(+ _ j i^2 ) a_j^a_i where the latter constant is defined as in equation [ kappa ] . as before , since @xmath121 for all @xmath47 , we have that for any @xmath27 , the evolution of @xmath120 is damped at a rate on the order of at least @xmath122 .",
    "we now consider a finite region of space @xmath123 , having a total mass operator @xmath124 letting @xmath125 denote the projector onto the indices @xmath126 , the net momentum in this space is |p_s & = _ s (a^3 ^3k |k a_|k^a _ |k ) _ s + & = a^3 _ j , j s a_j^a _ j ^3k |k e^-i ( |x_j - |x_j ) |k where the integral is over @xmath127^{\\otimes 3}$ ] , and we used the defintion @xmath128 one may verify that the vector operator @xmath129 satisfies the commutation relations @xmath130 = i \\delta_{m n } \\hbar \\sum_{j\\in s } \\hat a_j^\\dagger \\hat a_j$ ] , where @xmath131 is proportional to the @xmath13th coordinate of the center of mass position within region @xmath123 . from the above analysis",

    "we can use this heating rate , a consequence of restricting the gravitational potential to only convey classical information , to get experimental bounds for the length scale @xmath4 of our theory .",
    "namely , a critical temperature @xmath136 nk and typical lifetime of 5 seconds for rubidium-87 bec s yields a per - atom heating rate of @xmath137 j / s .",

    "using @xmath141 gives a slightly tighter bound @xmath142 m .",
    "we have shown that combining observational constraints of interactions indicative of a @xmath0 force law with the concept that such forces can not communicate quantum information leads to a simple model for ` classical communication only ' theories of gravity .",
    "our particular approach , using measurement and feedback as calculational tools , saturates the minimum noise and dephasing rates anticipated for any such model . examination of two particular cases  matter wave interference and heating of massive objects  indicate that most likely any ` classical communication only ' model of gravity breaks down at length scales larger than expected for new gravitational physics to emerge .",
    "however , stringent tests of softening of newtonian interactions at short length scales remain before these bounds become complete .",
