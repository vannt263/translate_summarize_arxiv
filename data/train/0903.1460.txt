    "type ii supernovae ( sne ii ) are understood as the result of the final gravitational collapse of massive stars ( @xmath8  m@xmath9 ) that at the moment of the explosion have most of their hydrogen envelope intact .",
    "the energy released in the explosion is typically @xmath10 erg ( mainly radiated in the form of neutrinos ) , and the luminosity of the sn during the first few months after explosion can be comparable to the total luminosity of its host galaxy .",
    "these objects have been classified based on their light curves into type iip ( plateau ) and type iil ( linear ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the former present a nearly constant optical luminosity during the photospheric phase ( @xmath3100 days after explosion ) , while the latter show a slow decline in luminosity during that phase .",
    "however , there are some sn ii events , such as the sn 1987a , that show peculiar photometric properties .",
    "also , studies of sn  ii spectra have revealed the existence of a subclass , characterized by the presence of narrow spectral lines , called sne iin @xcite , which are most likely originated from the interaction of the sn ejecta with pre - existing circumstellar material ; see @xcite for a general review of sn spectra . due to their high intrinsic luminosities , sne",
    "ii have great potential as extragalactic distance indicators . to date ,",
    "several methods have been proposed to derive distances to sne ii , but two are the most commonly used : the expanding photosphere method ( epm ) @xcite and the standardized candle method ( scm ) @xcite .",
    "the former is a geometrical technique that relates the photospheric radius and the angular radius of a sn in order to derive its distance , and has been applied to several sne to derive the hubble constant ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the epm is independent of the extragalactic distance ladder , and therefore does not need any external calibration .",
    "the scm is based on the observed relation between expansion velocity and luminosity of sne  iip .",
    "recently , this method has been applied to a sample of high - redshift sne @xcite .",
    "other methods have also been used to determine distances to sne  ii , such as the spectral - fitting expanding atmosphere method ( seam ) @xcite and the plateau - tail relation proposed by @xcite . in this work",
    "we apply the epm using early spectroscopy and photometry of 12 sne  iip in order to derive their distances .",
    "we apply the method using two sets of sn  ii atmosphere models @xcite , three filter subsets ( @xmath11 ) , and two methods for the host - galaxy extinction .",
    "the different combinations lead to 12 hubble diagrams .",
    "section 2 of this paper describes the photometric and spectroscopic observations . in   3 , the epm is presented , and we apply it to 12 sne  iip .",
    "the results are discussed in   4 .",
    "we compare our epm distances with results from other methods and with previous epm analyses .",
    "we also discuss the error analysis and the effect of reddening on the epm distances .",
    "we show 12 hubble diagrams and the corresponding hubble constants , and we propose an external calibration for the epm .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions in   5 .",
    "in this work we use photometry and spectroscopy from four sn follow - up programs : the cerro tololo supernova program ( 19861996 ) , the caln / tololo supernova survey ( ct ; 19901993 ) , the supernova optical and infrared survey ( soirs ; 19992000 ) and the carnegie type ii supernova program ( cats ; 2002 - 2003 ) . during these programs optical ( and some ir )",
    "photometry and spectroscopy were obtained for nearly 100 sne , 51 of which belong to the type ii class .",
    "all of the optical data have already been reduced and will soon be published @xcite .",
    "we also complemented our dataset with some spectra from various coauthors of this paper .",
    "direct images of sne were obtained with telescopes from four different observatories : the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) , the las campanas observatory ( lco ) , the european southern observatory ( eso ) in la silla , and the steward observatory ( s0 ) . several telescopes and instruments",
    "were used to obtain the photometry , which is listed in an electronic table . in all cases",
    "ccd detectors and standard johnson - kron - cousins _ ubvriz _ filters @xcite were employed . for a small subset of sne observations in the _ jhk _ filters were also obtained .",
    "the data reduction was performed using iraf according to the procedure described by @xcite .",
    "the error in the photometry ranges between 0.01 - 0.06 mag , with a typical value of 0.02 mag .",
    "the optical light curves of all the sne used in this work are shown in figures [ fig_lightcurve1][fig_lightcurve3 ] , clearly revealing the plateau nature of all these events .",
    "low resolution ( @xmath12 ) optical spectra ( wavelength range @xmath3320010000   ) were taken for each sn at various epochs using telescopes and instruments from four different observatories .",
    "an electronic table lists all the telescopes and instruments used for the spectroscopy .",
    "most of the spectra were obtained with the slit along the parallactic angle ( filippenko 1982 ) .",
    "the wavelength calibration was performed using comparison - lamp spectra taken at the position of each sn .",
    "the flux calibration was done via observations of flux - standard stars @xcite . for more details on the observational procedures",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the spectra were shifted to the rest frame using the heliocentric redshifts given in in order to measure the sn ejecta velocities . in seven cases we were able to measure the redshifts from narrow emission lines of h  ii regions at the sn position ( see table [ tab_sn_list ] ) .",
    "also , in one case ( sn 1999em ) we adopted the value from @xcite which corresponds to the redshift measured at the sn position . in four cases we were unable to extract this information from our data , and we had to rely on redshifts of the host - galaxy nuclei ; this does not take into account the rotation velocities of the host galaxies , which are typically @xmath13 200 @xmath14 .",
    "fifty - one sne  ii were observed in the surveys described above .",
    "we cut this sample according to the epm requirements , which are ( 1 ) the optical sn light curve ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 bands ) must show a nearly constant luminosity during the photospheric phase , i.e , the sn must belong to the sn  iip class ( see figures [ fig_lightcurve1][fig_lightcurve3 ] ) ; ( 2 ) the sn must have early - time photometry ; and ( 3 ) the sn must have at least three early spectroscopic observations .",
    "the necessity for all of these requirements , discussed in   3.6 , reduced the sample to only 11 sne .",
    "we also added the sn iip 1999gi to our sample , which has extensive photometry and spectroscopy published by @xcite .",
    "the epm is a geometrical technique that relates an angular size and a physical size of a sn , in order to derive its distance .",
    "although the angular radius @xmath17 of a sn can not be resolved spatially with current optical instrumentation , it can be derived assuming a spherically symmetric expanding photosphere ( a reasonable assumption for sne iip at early times , as discussed by @xcite ) that radiates as a black body  diluted \" by a factor @xmath18 .",
    "specifically ,    @xmath19}}},\\ ] ]    where @xmath20 is the photospheric radius , @xmath21 is the distance to the sn , @xmath22 is the observed flux density , @xmath23 is the observed wavelength , @xmath24 is the planck function in the sn rest frame , @xmath25 is the color temperature , @xmath26 is the corresponding wavelength in the sn rest frame , @xmath27 is the foreground dust extinction and @xmath28 is the host - galaxy extinction . the factor @xmath29 ( known as  distance correction factor \" or  dilution factor \" )",
    "accounts for the fact that a sn does not radiate as a perfect black body ; there is flux dilution caused by grey electron scattering which makes the photosphere ( defined as the region of total optical depth @xmath30 ) form in a layer above the thermalization surface . also , the dilution factor accounts for line blanketing in the sn atmosphere .",
    "since electron scattering is the main source of continuum opacity , the total opacity is essentially grey , and the photospheric angular radius is independent of wavelength in the optical and near - infrared @xcite , which explains why @xmath20 and @xmath17 do not carry a wavelength subscript . because the gravitational binding energy ( @xmath31 erg ) of a sn progenitor is far less than the expansion kinetic energy ( @xmath32 erg ) of the ejecta , it is reasonable to assume free expansion .",
    "this assumption is supported by hydrodynamical models which show that the different layers of the ejecta reach @xmath395% of their terminal velocities @xmath31 day after the explosion . during this brief period",
    "there is a transition from an acceleration phase due to the sn explosion , to homologous expansion @xcite . due to the high expansion velocities ( @xmath310000 @xmath33 ) ,",
    "the initial radius ( typically @xmath34 cm for a red supergiant ) can be neglected after @xmath31 day from explosion ; hence after that period the physical radius of the sn can be approximated by    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the photospheric velocity and @xmath37 is the explosion date . combining ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) we obtain    @xmath38    where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the derived quantities measured at time @xmath41 , which are estimated following the steps explained in the next sections .",
    "equation 3 shows that the quantity @xmath42 increases linearly with time , so @xmath21 and @xmath37 can be derived from at least two spectroscopic and photometric observations .",
    "more observations allow us to check the internal consistency of the method .",
    "the dilution factors correspond to the ratio of the luminosity of a sn atmosphere model ( @xmath43 ) and the corresponding black - body luminosity ,    @xmath44    in practice , the dilution factors must be derived for the same filter subsets employed to determine the color temperature ( @xmath25 ) of a sn . in this work we focus on three different optical filter subsets ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) , and we used two sn atmosphere models , those by @xcite ( e96 hereafter ) and @xcite ( d05 hereafter ) , to compute the dilution factors .",
    "see also @xcite for more details of the input parameters of the d05 models .",
    "because the color temperature of each sn was determined from colors measured in the observer s rest frame , both the atmosphere models and the black - body function must be redshifted ; thus , the dilution factors must be computed for the specific redshift of each sn .",
    "we computed _ b , v , i _ synthetic magnitudes using 58 spectra from e96 atmosphere models and 138 spectra from d05 atmosphere models . for each filter subset @xmath45 ( that is , @xmath46 ) , we fit black - body functions in the sn rest frame @xmath47 , and solved for @xmath48 and @xmath49 by minimizing the quantity    @xmath50 ^ 2.\\ ] ]    here @xmath20 is the photospheric radius , @xmath51 is the redshifted synthetic absolute magnitude of the atmosphere model for a band with central wavelength @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is the synthetic magnitude of @xmath54}/(1+z)$ ] , given by    @xmath55}}}}{hc(1+z)}s(\\lambda)d\\lambda + zp,\\ ] ]    where @xmath56 is the filter transmision function and @xmath57 is the zero point of the photometric system @xcite . the constants @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the planck constant and the speed of light , respectively .",
    "clearly , the dilution factors depend on the specific redshift of the sn and on the filter subset used to obtain temperature of the models .",
    "figure [ fig_zeta ] shows the resulting dilution factors versus temperature at @xmath60 .",
    "we performed polynomial fits to @xmath61 of the form    @xmath62    table [ tab_zeta_coef ] lists the @xmath63 coefficients at @xmath60 for three filter subsets and both atmosphere models ( e96 and d05 ) .",
    "the corresponding polynomial fits are shown in .",
    "the d05 dilution factors are quite insensitive to the color temperature above @xmath39000 k , and lie around 0.5 , while at lower temperatures they increase sharply with decreasing temperature , reaching a value over unity below @xmath35000 k. the e96 dilution factors present the same pattern , but they are systematically lower than the d05 dilution factors by the origin of these differences is unclear . @xcite discuss that the discrepancy might be related to the different approach used to handle relativistic terms .",
    "also , d05 solved the non - lte ( local thermodynamic equilibrium ) ( non - lte ) problem for all the species , and employed a very complex atom model .",
    "e96 , on the other hand , solved the non - lte problem for a few species , while for the rest of the metals the excitation and ionization were assumed to be given by the saha - boltzmann equation , and the opacity was taken as pure scattering .",
    "another important difference between the e96 and d05 dilution factors is the dependence on the parameters involved in the atmosphere modelling .",
    "while the e96 dilution factors show little sensivity to a broad range of phyical parameters other than temperature , the d05 models show a larger dispersion at a given color temperature . however , this is also due to d05 models covering a larger range of radii , density profiles ( @xmath64 ) and temperature than e96 . on average ,",
    "the e96 models lead to a dispersion of @xmath65 in @xmath66 , while the d05 models yield @xmath67",
    ".      an apparent angular radius ( @xmath68 ) and a color temperature ( @xmath48 ) of the sn can be obtained by fitting a planck function @xmath69 to the observed broad - band magnitudes ( see eq .",
    "@xmath45 is the filter subset combination , i.e. , @xmath70 .",
    "since we have two unknowns ( @xmath68,@xmath71 ) , the subsets must contain at least two filters . in order to derive these parameters , we used a least - squares technique at each spectroscopic observation epoch ( see  3.6 ) by minimizing the quantity    @xmath72 ^ 2}{\\sigma_m^2}.\\ ] ]    here",
    ", @xmath73 is the apparent magnitude in the filter with central wavelength @xmath74 ( i.e. , @xmath75 ) , @xmath76 is the photometric error in the magnitude @xmath77 , and @xmath78 is defined in eq .",
    "6 . because @xmath79 is mainly a function of the color temperature ( fig .",
    "[ fig_zeta ] ) , it is possible to use @xmath48 to solve for @xmath80 and determine the true angular radius @xmath17 from @xmath68 .",
    "once @xmath17 is determined , the next step is to measure the photospheric velocity ( see eq .",
    "the photospheric velocity of the sn at a given epoch can be obtained from the absorption lines in the spectra .",
    "we measured velocities0.035c , for which the difference in the velocity using the relativistic and non - relativistic formulae is less than 2% .",
    "however , typical velocities employed in the epm analysis are of 0.02c , for which the difference is @xmath81 1% . ] from the minima of h@xmath82 , h@xmath83 , h@xmath84 , and fe ii @xmath85 lines , for all 12 sne .",
    "the tables that list the spectroscopic velocities are available in electronic format .",
    "figures [ fig_sne_velocities1]-[fig_sne_velocities3 ] show the temporal evolution of the spectral line velocities . to date the photospheric velocities",
    "have been estimated using weak spectral absorption features such as fe ii @xmath86 , 5018 , 4924 , and sc ii @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "the physical assumption is that these lines are weak and formed near the photosphere of the sn .",
    "however , there are two problems with this approach : ( 1 ) at early times the spectra are dominated by balmer lines and the weak lines are absent , and ( 2 ) the synthetic spectra show that even the weak lines do not necessarily yield true photospheric velocities @xcite .",
    "one way to circumvent these problems is to use the balmer lines which are present in the spectra over most of the evolution of the sn .",
    "although the balmer lines are optically thicker than the lines , @xcite argue that , contrary to what is usually believed , optically thick lines do not necessarily overestimate the photospheric velocity , and the offset from the photospheric velocity can be measured from the synthetic spectra . in this work we decided to use the minimum of the h@xmath83 absorption line to derive the photospheric velocity",
    "because this line is present during the entire plateau phase , it can be easily identified , and it does not present any blend , at least in the first @xmath350 days after explosion . to convert from observed h@xmath83 spectroscopic velocities to true photospheric velocities we used the synthetic spectra from e96 and d05 . figure [ fig_models_vhbeta_vphot ] shows ( in red ) the ratio of h@xmath83 velocity and the photospheric velocity , as a function of h@xmath83 velocity for all of the d05 models .",
    "note that the d05 models predict that the h@xmath83 line forms quite close to the photosphere at all epochs ( for all values of @xmath88 ) .",
    "also plotted in figure [ fig_models_vhbeta_vphot ] ( in blue ) are the e96 models which confirm that the h@xmath83 forms close to the photosphere at early epochs , when @xmath88 is high . however , at later epochs ( lower @xmath88 ) e96 predict that h@xmath83 forms in outer layers ( higher velocities ) than d05 .",
    "it is also important to note that the e96 models cover a shorter range in velocity ( @xmath89450012000 @xmath14 ) than the d05 models ( @xmath3200017000 @xmath14 ) , which restricts the epm analysis using the e96 models . to derive the ratio between the h@xmath83 and the photospheric velocity we used a polynomial fit of the form    @xmath90    ( see figure [ fig_models_vhbeta_vphot ] ) .",
    "the @xmath91 coefficients are listed in table [ tab_ratio_coef ] .",
    "the e96 models lead to a dispersion of @xmath92 and the d05 models to @xmath93 .",
    "the photospheric velocity @xmath40 can be obtained from a measurement of @xmath88 :    @xmath94    in order to examine which of the adopted photospheric velocity conversions was closer to reality , we compared the ratio between the h@xmath82 and h@xmath83 velocities measured from the observed spectra of our sample of sne and from the synthetic spectra of the e96 and d05 models .",
    "figure [ fig_obs_vel.ratio ] shows the h@xmath95 velocity ratio as a function of the h@xmath83 velocity .",
    "it can be seen that , while there is good agreement between theory and observations at high h@xmath83 velocities ( @xmath3700010500 @xmath14 ) , the d05 models underestimate the h@xmath82 velocities ( or overestimate the h@xmath83 velocities ) at lower expansion velocities .",
    "this could be due to time - dependence effects that are not include in the d05 models that assume steady - state @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the h@xmath82/h@xmath83 velocity ratio predicted by the e96 models is in good agreement with the observations at all h@xmath83 velocities , although there are few models below @xmath36000 @xmath14 to draw strong conclusions .",
    "this suggests that e96 predict more realistic line profiles in the sn ejecta than d05 and therefore should provide a better photospheric velocity conversion .      to estimate the amount of galactic foreground extinction we used the ir dust maps of @xcite .",
    "table [ tab_reddening ] summarizes the foreground extinction adopted . in this work we used two different methods for the determination of host - galaxy reddenings of our sn sample : a spectroscopic method ( des hereafter ) , and a method based on the color evolution of the sne ( oli hereafter ) .",
    "the former consists in fitting different model spectra to the early - time spectra of a sn .",
    "the two fitting parameters are the amount of reddening and the photospheric temperature @xcite .",
    "the color - based technique was developed by @xcite and is based on the assumption that the color at the end of the plateau phase is the same for all sne iip . in both cases we adopted the @xcite extinction law ( with @xmath96 ) .",
    "table [ tab_reddening ] lists the host galaxy visual extinction values @xmath97 obtained from both methods .",
    "also , figure [ fig_des_oli_reddening ] shows the oli versus des visual extinctions . as can be seen",
    ", there are no systematic differences between the models . however , there are individual differences , especially in five sne , whose names are explicitly marked in the plot .",
    "the epm method is only valid in the optically thick phase of a h - rich expanding atmosphere .",
    "observationally , this period corresponds to the plateau phase of type ii sne and thus justifies our first selection criterion in @xmath98 2.3 .",
    "the epm requires at least two simultaneous photometric and spectroscopic observations ( see eq .",
    "3 ) , but we recommend the use of at least three points in order to obtain an internal check . the photometry is used to determine the angular size of the sn and the spectroscopy is used to measure the expansion velocities of the sn . the requirement of simultaneous photometric and spectroscopic observations is usually not accomplished ; the photometry and the spectroscopy of a sn are taken at different epochs . to overcome this problem ,",
    "it is necessary to interpolate the photometry or the velocities measured from the spectra . in this work we decided to interpolate the photometry for two reasons : ( 1 )",
    "the number of photometric observations in our sample of sne is far greater than the number of spectroscopic observations , and ( 2 ) the optical apparent magnitude of sne  ii - p is nearly constant during the plateau phase , making the photometry interpolation more reliable than the velocity interpolation , which has a steeper dependence with time .",
    "to interpolate a magnitude at the epoch of a given spectroscopic observation , we use a quadratic polynomial fit , using four photometric observations around the spectroscopic date . in this study",
    ", we restricted the epm analysis to the first @xmath34550 days after explosion because there are clear departures from linearity in the @xmath42 versus @xmath99 plots after this date .",
    "@xcite show that the d05 models are poor at late time and therefore should not be used for such epochs , supporting this restriction . in figure [ fig_full_sn99em.epm ]",
    "we plot the epm solutions for sn 1999em ( because it has extensive photometric and spectroscopic observations during the plateau phase ) using the @xmath100 , and @xmath2 filter subsets and the d05 models .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the least - squares fit to the derived epm quantities using the first @xmath101 days after explosion , while the dashed line correspond to the least - squares fit using only the first @xmath102 days after explosion . as can be noted , after @xmath102 days from explosion ( marked with a red triangle ) there is departure from the linear @xmath42 versus @xmath99 relation in all three cases .",
    "this justifies our second and third selection criteria in .",
    "however , this restriction severely lowers the number of sne of our sample to which we can apply the epm .",
    "out of the initial 51 sne of the @xcite sample , only 11 objects fulfill the requirement of having a plateau behavior and having early - time photometry and spectroscopy for the epm analysis .",
    "we present here the epm analysis of 12 sne  iip ( 11 from our database and one from the literature ) with early spectroscopic and photometric observations .",
    "we carried out the analysis using three different filter subsets ( @xmath11 ) , two sets of host - galaxy extinction ( oli , des ) , and two atmosphere models ( e96 , d05 ) , yielding a total of 12 solutions for each sn .",
    "the tables that summarize the epm quantities are available in electronic format for all 144 cases . in the remainder of this section",
    "we restrict the presentation to the 6 solutions that use the des extinction because they give the lowest dispersion in the hubble diagrams .",
    "figures [ fig_sn92ba_epm][fig_sn03iq_epm ] show these 6 solutions for each of the 12 sne .",
    "below , we provide the epm distance @xmath21 and the explosion date @xmath103 and their uncertainties , using des and the \\{vi } filter subset , and we compare the time of explosion to the range restricted by pre - sn images of the host galaxies .",
    "these results are also summarized in table [ tab_vi_des.epm ] . in order to obtain a more realistic estimation of the uncertainty in the distance and the explosion date , we computed 100 monte carlo simulations for each sn , in which we varied all the parameters involved in the epm ( see table [ tab_errors ] ) , and we averaged the 100 distances and explosion dates to derive the epm values of @xmath21 and @xmath103 .",
    "this produces small differences between the results computed from the initial single epm solution and that obtained from the 100 monte carlo simulations , but the latter provides a much more realistic estimate of the uncertainties .",

    "we found two main sources of error . in the e96 case ,",
    "the errors in the photospheric velocity conversion and the dilution factors have the largest effect in the distance uncertainty , each one contributing @xmath123% of the total error , while in the d05 case the error in the dilution factors produces @xmath124% of the uncertainty in the distance , far greater than that due to the error in the photospheric velocity conversion ( @xmath118% of the total error ) .",
    "all of the other errors have a secondary effect in the total error .      since the discovery of the expansion of the universe @xcite",

    "today the discrepancy is not over , but there is a convergence into a value of @xmath1286580 @xmath129 ) @xcite . in this work we applied the epm method to 12 sne using two sets of dilution factors ( e96 , d05 ) , two extinction determination methods ( oli , des ) , and three filter subsets ( @xmath130 and @xmath2 ) to derive their distances . in order to obtain the host - galaxy redshifts",

    "figures [ fig_bv_des.hd][fig_vi_des.hd ] show the same diagrams but this time using des extinctions .",
    "each diagram is labeled with the derived hubble constant , the reduced @xmath133 , and the dispersion in distance modulus @xmath134 from the linear fit .",
    "the resulting @xmath5 values are summarized in table [ tab_h0_values ] .",
    "there is a systematic difference in the @xmath135 values obtained with the e96 and d05 models . using e96 we obtained @xmath136 89101 @xmath137 while d05 yielded @xmath136 5266 @xmath129 .",
    "this difference arises both from the systematically higher d05 dilution factors and the different photospheric velocity conversion between both models .",
    "these two effects combined lead to differences of @xmath138 in the epm distances .",
    "the use of different filter subsets leads to @xmath135 values consistent within @xmath139 for a fixed atmosphere model .",
    "this is a very important result , because it suggest an internal consistency for each set of atmosphere models .",
    "however , the use of different filter subsets produces significant differences in dispersion , increasing from @xmath140 ( \\{vi } ) to @xmath141 ( \\{bvi } ) and @xmath142 ( \\{bv } ) ( see table [ tab_dispersion_values ] ) . the special case of d05 with \\{vi } and",
    "des , leads to @xmath143 , which corresponds to @xmath144% of error in distance .",
    "clearly when the @xmath145 band is employed , the dispersion in the hubble diagram increases considerably .",
    "this is due to the fact that the dilution factors in the b band , are mostly determined by the effect of line blanketing rather than by electron scattering , so the assumption of a  dilute \" black body becomes less reliable .",
    "it is also possible that metallicity differences of the sne could explain part of this scatter , although both atmosphere model sets predict a modest effect of metallicity in the emergent flux at wavelengths longer than @xmath814000  .",
    "as expected , it can be noted that there are no significant differences in the @xmath135 values and in the hubble diagram dispersion between the des and oli reddening methods .",
    "this is because there is no systematic difference in the reddening between both methods ( see however , the des method leads to somewhat lower dispersion in the hubble diagrams than the oli technique .",
    "finally , sn 2003hl and sn 2003iq are of particular interest because they both exploded in the same galaxy .",
    "to our disappointment , all 12 possible combinations of filter subsets , reddening , and atmosphere models lead to significant differences in the epm distance to the host galaxy .",
    "the most extreme case is the @xmath0 , e96 , and oli combination , which leads to a distance of 32.5 @xmath7 8.5 mpc to sn 2003iq and 12.8 @xmath7 1.6 mpc to sn 2003hl ( a difference of 2.3 sigma ) .",
    "the smallest discrepancy occurs with the @xmath2 , d05 , and des combinations ( 30.3 @xmath7 6.3 and 53.3 @xmath7 17.1 mpc for sn 2003hl and sn 2003iq , respectively ) , which is also the combination that produces the lowest dispersion in the hubble diagram . as discussed in  3 , the epm solutions to sn 2003iq yield an explosion time inconsistent with a pre - discovery image ,",
    "hence the epm distance to sn 2003iq is quite suspicious .",
    "the light curve and the spectroscopic velocity evolution of both sne are typical of the type iip class , so this is not the reason for the inconsistency in the epm solutions . given the high host - galaxy extinction to sn  2003hl , it is conceivable that the discrepancy could be due to a departure from the standard reddening law .",
    "we explored this possibility by varying @xmath146 over the range 1.1 - 3.1 using the @xmath2 and d05 models .",
    "for the case @xmath146=3.1 we obtain d(03hl)/d(03iq)=0.57 , while for @xmath146=1.1 we get d(03hl)/d(03iq)=0.72 .",
    "this exercise shows that , although the discrepancy is not completely removed , lowering @xmath146 brings the two distances in better agreement .",
    "interestingly , @xcite found an optimal value of @xmath146=1.4 from a set of 34 sne  iip using the scm .",
    "all this suggests that either 1 ) the dust around sne  iip has different properties than the galactic dust , or 2 ) sne  iip are surrounded by galactic - like dust whose geometric distribution is responsible for an abnormal low value of @xmath146 @xcite .",
    "in the previous section we have shown that there is a systematic difference in the @xmath5 values derived using the e96 and the d05 models . in order to remove this systematic effect , we applied a calibration factor ( given by the ratio between some external @xmath5 value and the epm @xmath5 value ) to the distances derived using e96 and d05 . for this purpose",
    "we used the value of @xmath147 derived from the _ hst key project _ @xcite .",
    "this external calibration allows us to bring the epm distances to the cepheid scale and allows us to remove the systematic difference in the epm distances between e96 and d05 .",
    "figure [ fig_cepheids_vi_des.hd ] shows ( top panel ) the d05 distances versus the e96 distances divided by a calibration factor of 1.37 and 0.79 , respectively . in both cases the epm distances",
    "were derived using the @xmath2 filter subset and the des reddening . as can be seen , after applying this correction , the systematic differences disappear .",
    "the dashed line in the top panel corresponds to the one to one relation .",
    "also , in figure [ fig_cepheids_vi_des.hd ] ( bottom panel ) are plotted the differences between the corrected e96 and d05 distances , normalized to the corresponding average between the corrected e96 and d05 distance .",
    "we found a standard deviation of @xmath148 .",
    "since the dispersion arises from the combined errors in the e96 and the d05 distances , the internal random errors in any of the epm implementation must be less than 12% .",
    "note that this scatter is smaller than the @xmath144% dispersion seen in the hubble diagrams , which is affected by the peculiar motion of the host galaxies .",
    "the 12% scatter is independent of the redshift and must be an upper value of the internal precision of the epm .",
    "in this work we have applied the epm method to 12 sne iip .",
    "we contructed 12 different hubble diagrams , using three different filter subsets ( @xmath149 ) , two atmosphere models ( e96 , d05 ) , and two methods to determine the amount of host - galaxy extinction ( des , oli ) .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows .",
    "the epm must be restricted to the first @xmath34550 days from explosion .",
    "after that epoch the method may display departures from linearity in the @xmath42 versus time relation , and therefore an internal inconsistency .",
    "the results are less precise when the @xmath145 band is used in the epm analysis , regardless of the atmosphere models employed ( e96 or d05 ) .",
    "the dispersion in the hubble diagrams increases considerably from 0.3 to 0.5 mag when the @xmath145 band is included and the @xmath15 band is removed from the filter subset . despite the loss in precision , there are no significant differences in the resulting distances .",
    "we investigated the effect of host - galaxy reddening in the epm distances .",
    "for this purpose we computed many epm solutions varying the amount of visual extinction , and we found that a difference of @xmath150 mag leads on average to a difference of @xmath3510% in distance .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the method is quite insensitive to the effect of dust",
    ". systematic differences in the atmosphere models lead to @xmath151% differences in the epm distances and to values of @xmath5 between 52 and 101 @xmath137 .",
    "this effect is due to the systematic difference in the photospheric velocity conversion and the dilution factors .",
    "the latter is currently the greatest source of uncertainty in the epm method .",
    "the hubble diagram with the lowest dispersion ( @xmath152 mag ) was obtained using the combination d05 , @xmath2 , des . despite the systematic uncertainties in the epm ,",
    "this dispersion is quite low and corresponds to a precision of @xmath144% in distance .",
    "this precision is similar to that of the scm method for type ii sne @xcite and to the tully - fisher relation for spiral galaxies with a dispersion of @xmath153 mag @xcite .",
    "however , the epm dispersion is greater than that of the m/@xmath154 relation for type ia sne , which has a dispersion of @xmath1550.150.20 mag ; however , if the epm is applied to a sample of sne  iip in the hubble flow , the dispersion in the hubble diagram might decrease . finally , despite the systematic differences in the @xmath5 value , epm has great potential as an extragalactic distance indicator and can potentially be applied to a sample of high - redshift sne iip in order to check in an independent way the accelerating expansion of the universe .",
    "we thank luc dessart and ronald eastman for providing us with their atmosphere models .",
    "we are also grateful to robert kirshner for providing some spectra used in this work .",
    "we acknowledge support from the millennium center for supernova science through grant p06 - 045-f funded by `` programa bicentenario de ciencia y tecnologa de conicyt '' and `` programa iniciativa cientfica milenio de mideplan '' .",
