    "such additional assumptions have been questioned by nickel  @xcite , who argued the presence of confluent singularities in the @xmath2-function at its zero , which may complicate the analytic structure of the borel transform .",

    "it is therefore important to exploit other approaches to the study of o(@xmath10 ) models , which can provide a check of the estimates of @xmath4 from the resummations of the perturbative @xmath0-expansion , and of their actual accuracy .",

    "the analysis of the @xmath7 series of @xmath4 provides already good estimates with an apparent uncertainty of approximately 6% for small values of @xmath10 .",
    "a considerable improvement in the analysis of the @xmath6-expansion of @xmath4 is achieved using the known values of @xmath4 for lower - dimensional @xmath24 models , i.e. for @xmath9 .",
    "the key point is that @xmath4 is expected to be analytic and quite smooth in the domain @xmath25 ( thus @xmath26 ) .",
