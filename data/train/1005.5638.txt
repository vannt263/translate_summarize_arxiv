    "blum and auroux  @xcite proposed a new inversion algorithm for identifying the initial state of an observable system , based on the application of back - and - forth observers . noting that we have only access to a measurement output on a fixed time interval @xmath0 , the idea consists in proposing a first asymptotic observer for the system that will be applied in this time interval and a second one that will be applied to the system where the direction of time is reversed .",
    "these observers are then used iteratively to get a better estimate of the initial state after each back - and - forth iteration .",
    "if the two observer gains are well - chosen , so that the whole back - and - forth procedure induces a contracting error dynamic , one can ensure the convergence of the estimator towards the initial state .",
    "more recently , ramdani - et - al  @xcite have considered , for the case of wave equations , the theoretical study of this problem applying techniques borrowed from semigroups theory . here , we consider a similar problem to  @xcite for a wave equation , where the initial state is known ( is zero ) and we are rather interested in identifying an unknown source term @xmath1 .",
    "let also @xmath2 , @xmath3 and let @xmath4 .",
    "we consider the following system @xmath5 where @xmath6 represents the state of the system and @xmath7 is the output . the term @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a fixed ( known ) frequency and @xmath1 is unknown , is considered to be an external force which varies harmonically .",
    "+ for any @xmath4 there exists a unique solution @xmath10;h^1_0(0,1))\\cap c^2([0,t];l^2(0,1))$ ] to and @xmath11 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 2 ) ) .",
    "it is moreover well - known from the work @xcite of yamamoto that this problem is well - posed in the sense that one can retrieve the source term @xmath1 from the measurement of @xmath7 on the time interval @xmath0 if @xmath12 is large enough .",
    "our aim here is to propose well - chosen observers which allow , using a back - and - forth procedure , to retrieve @xmath13 from @xmath7 in the minimal observation time .",
    "more precisely , we prove the following result    [ th1 ] we can construct efficient observers for which the back - and - forth algorithm is convergent and which allow , using the measurement output @xmath14 over the time - interval @xmath15 , to reconstruct the unknown source term @xmath1 .",
    "let us point out that since the spatial domain is given by @xmath16 , the minimum observability time is given by @xmath17 .    note that , whenever the whole initial state @xmath18 is unknown , system is not observable . in order to realize this",
    ", one can consider the simpler case where the source term @xmath13 is given by only the two first modes of the wave equation , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the unknown scalars . in this case , becomes equivalent to two independent oscillators with different frequencies and with two unknown source terms @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "moreover , the output is given by a linear combination of the position of the oscillators .",
    "this six dimensional system with one output is not observable .",
    "however , if we know the initial state of the oscillators , the two parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 become identifiable .",
    "+ the back - and - forth estimator allows us to take into account this knowledge of the initial state @xmath24 of the wave equation . on the contrary , if we had only used a forward observer , we would have lost the information on the initial state of the system and therefore there would have been no reason for the observer to converge to the real parameters .",
    "+ we prove the convergence of the algorithm using lyapunov techniques and lasalle s principle .",
    "one of the main difficulties comes from the fact that the precompactness of the trajectories is not ensured since we deal with an infinite dimensional system and we also have to use sharp mathematical estimates .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows .",
    "+ in section 2 , we prove the equivalence between and another system which consists in a system composed of a wave equation without any source term and an oscillator in cascade . here",
    "the unknown term to retrieve is the initial condition .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the proof of claim [ th1 ] and is divided in two parts . in the first one we study the well - posedness of the proposed observer and in the second one we prove its convergence through the back - and - forth procedure . in section 4 , we provide some numerical simulations illustrating the efficiency of the method . finally in section 5 ,",
    "we propose and analyze the extension of the method to the case of wave equations with @xmath25-dimensional spatial domain .",
    "we begin with introducing the following system ,    @xmath26    @xmath27    where @xmath28 represents the state of the system and @xmath29 is the output . here , the fact that @xmath30 and @xmath31 are well - defined is a consequence of the definition of @xmath7 ( see ) and the regularity property .",
    "system - is nothing but a homogeneous wave equation and an oscillator in cascade .",
    "the unknown @xmath13 is now the initial datum of the system .",
    "the aim of this section is to prove both following results    [ prop0 ] there exists a unique solution @xmath32;h^1_0(0,1))\\times c([0,t];l^2(0,1))\\times h^2(0,t)\\times h^1(0,t)\\ ] ] to .",
