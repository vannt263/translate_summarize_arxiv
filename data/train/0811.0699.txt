    "when we consider boolean circuits with a limited number of not gates , there is a basic question : can a given boolean function be computed by a circuit with a limited number of not gates ?",
    "this question has been answered by markov @xcite in 1958 .",
    "the _ inversion complexity _ of a boolean function @xmath0 is the minimum number of not gates required to construct a boolean circuit computing @xmath0 , and markov completely determined the inversion complexity of every boolean function @xmath0 . in particular , it has been shown that @xmath1 not gates are sufficient to compute any boolean function .    after more than 30 years from the result of markov , santha and",
    "wilson @xcite investigated the inversion complexity in _ constant depth circuits _ and showed that on the restriction @xmath1 not gates are not sufficient to compute a boolean function .",
    "the result has been extended to _ bounded depth circuits _ by sung and tanaka @xcite .",
    "recently we completely determined the inversion complexity of every boolean function in _ non - deterministic circuits _ , and particularly proved that one not gate is sufficient to compute any boolean function if we can use an arbitrary number of guess inputs @xcite .    a boolean circuit",
    "whose gates have fan - out one is called a _",
    "formula_. formulas are one of well - studied circuit models in circuit complexity theory .",
    "note that a boolean circuit whose gates have fan - out one corresponds to a boolean formula . in this note",
    ", we investigate the inversion complexity in formulas , which corresponds to the minimum number of not operators in a boolean formula representing a boolean function . as far as we know",
    ", there is no result for the inversion complexity in formulas .",
    "we completely determine the inversion complexity of every boolean function in formulas .",
    "a _ circuit _ is an acyclic boolean circuit which consists of and gates of fan - in two , or gates of fan - in two and not gates .",
    "a _ formula _ is a circuit whose gates have fan - out one .",
    "we denote the number of not gates in a formula @xmath3 by @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath5 and @xmath6 be boolean vectors in @xmath7 .",

    "let @xmath82 be all not gates which change from down state to up state at the time .",
    "since @xmath11 , each @xmath83 for @xmath84 is connected from @xmath85 which changes from up state to down state by a path including no not gate . since the output of @xmath3 changes from @xmath76 to @xmath75 , the output of @xmath3",
    "is also connected from @xmath86 which changes from up state to down state by a path including no not gate . @xmath87 and @xmath86 are distinguished from each other , since @xmath3 is a formula .",
