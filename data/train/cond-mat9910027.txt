    "in a recent experiment @xcite , transport properties a system of @xmath0 superconducting grains in a strong magnetic field were studied .",
    "the samples were quite homogeneous with a typical diameter of the grains @xmath1 and the grains formed a @xmath2-dimensional array .",
    "as usual , sufficiently strong magnetic fields destroyed the superconductivity in the samples and a finite resistivity could be seen above a critical magnetic field .",
    "the applied magnetic fields reached @xmath3 , which was more than sufficient to destroy also the superconducting gap in each grain .",
    "the dependence of the resistivity on the magnetic field observed in ref .",
    "@xcite was not simple .",
    "although at extremely strong fields the resistivity was almost independent of the field , it _ increased _ when decreasing the magnetic field . only at sufficiently weak magnetic fields the resistivity started to decrease and",
    "finally the samples displayed superconducting properties .",
    "a similar behavior had been reported in a number of publications @xcite .",
    "a negative magnetoresistance due to weak localization effects is not unusual in disordered metals @xcite .",
    "however , the magnetoresistance of the granulated materials studied in ref .",
    "@xcite is quite noticeable in magnetic fields exceeding @xmath4 and is considerably larger than values estimated for the weak localization .",
    "the weak localization effects become very important if the system is near the anderson metal - insulator transition and one can expect there a complicated dependence on the magnetic field .",
    "one can , for example , argue @xcite that decreasing the magnetic field drives the system to the metal - insulator transition , which gives a large negative magnetoresistance .",
    "if the superconducting transition occurs earlier one gets a maximum of the resistivity near the transition characteristic for the experiments @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , investigation of this possibility is not simple .",
    "the metal - insulator transition occurs at values of the macroscopic conductance @xmath5 of the order of unity . at such values calculations",
    "are very difficult .",
    "the problem becomes even more complicated due to the coulomb interaction .",
    "it is well known @xcite , that , at small values of @xmath6 , the system must be an insulator even if the superconducting gap is finite in a single grain .",
    "a microscopic consideration of all these effects and a confirmation of the existence of the negative magnetoresistance near the superconducting point for @xmath7 is at present hardly possible and we do not try to treat the problem here .    instead , we consider below the region of large conductances @xmath8 , where the system without interactions would be a good metal .",
    "this region corresponds to large tunneling amplitudes between the grains .",
    "all effects of the weak localization and the charging effects have to be small for @xmath8 , which would imply that the resistivity could not considerably depend on the magnetic field .    nevertheless , we find that the magnetoresistance of a good granulated metal ( @xmath8 ) in a strong magnetic field and at low temperature _ must be _ _ negative .",
    "_ in our model , the superconducting gap in each granule is assumed to be suppressed by the strong magnetic field .",
    "all the interesting behavior considered below originates from the superconducting fluctuations that lead to a suppression of the density of states ( dos ) but do not help to carry an electric current .",
    "the main results have been already published @xcite and now we want to present details of calculations and clarify some additional questions .",
    "we consider , for example , influence of the zeeman splitting on the resistivity , find the critical field @xmath9 of the transition into the superconducting state , calculate the diamagnetic susceptibility and estimate weak localization corrections .",
    "theory of superconducting fluctuations near the transition into the superconducting state has been developed long ago @xcite ( for a review see ref .  ) . above the transition temperature @xmath10 ,",
    "non - equilibrium cooper pairs are formed and a new channel of charge transfer opens ( aslamazov - larkin contribution)@xcite .",
    "another fluctuation contribution comes from a coherent scattering of the electrons forming a cooper pair on impurities ( maki - thompson contribution)@xcite .",
    "both the fluctuation corrections increase the conductivity and , when a magnetic field is applied , lead to a positive magnetoresistance .",
    "formation of the non - equilibrium cooper pairs results also in a fluctuational gap in the one - electron spectrum @xcite but in conventional ( non granular ) superconductors the first two mechanisms are more important near @xmath10 and the conductivity increases when approaching the transition . the total conductivity for a bulk sample above the transition temperature @xmath10 can be written in the following form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the conductivity of a normal metal without electron - electron interaction , @xmath13 is the elastic mean free time , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the effective mass and the density of electrons , respectively . in eq .",

    "close to the critical temperature @xmath10 the al correction is more important than both the mt and dos corrections types and its contribution can be written as follows @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a small dimensionless positive parameter @xmath23 and @xmath24 for the three - dimensional case ( 3d ) , 1 for 2d and 3/2 for quasi-1d .",
    "( [ al1 ] ) was derived using a perturbation theory and therefore is valid provided the inequality @xmath25 is fulfilled .",
    "although typically the al and mt corrections are larger than the dos contribution , a small decrease of the transverse conductivity is possible in layered materials @xcite in a temperature interval not very close to the transition .",
    "it is relevant to emphasize that all previous study of the fluctuations has been done near the critical temperature @xmath10 in a zero or a weak magnetic field .",
    "in contrast , we are mainly concentrated on study of the transport at very low temperature in a strong magnetic field .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , fluctuations in this region have not been considered so far .",
    "a strong magnetic field destroys the superconducting gap in each granule .",
    "however , even at magnetic fields @xmath26 exceeding the critical field @xmath27 virtual cooper pairs can still be formed .",
    "it turns out , and it will be shown below , the influence of these pairs on the macroscopical transport is drastically different from that near @xmath10 .",
    "the existence of the virtual pairs leads to a reduction of the dos but , in the limit @xmath28 these pairs can not travel from one granule to another . as a result",

    "it approaches the value @xmath31 only in the limit @xmath32 when all the superconducting fluctuations are completely suppressed by the magnetic field .",
    "the superconducting pairing inside the grains is destroyed by both the orbital mechanism and the zeeman spliting .",
    "the critical magnetic field @xmath33 destroying the superconductivity in a single grain in this case can be estimated as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a flux quantum , @xmath36 is a radius of single grain and @xmath37 is the superconducting coherence length .",
    "the zeeman critical magnetic field @xmath38 can be written as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a bcs gap for the single grain at magnetic field @xmath41 and @xmath42 is a lande factor .",
    "we notice here that @xmath38 is independent of the size of the grain whereas for @xmath33 the size of the grain is important . the ratio of this two fields can be written in the form @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",
    "we can see from eq .",
    "( [ orbit ] ) that for @xmath45 the orbital critical magnetic field is smaller than the zeeman critical magnetic field @xmath46 and the suppression of superconductivity is due to the orbital mechanism .",
    "this condition is well satisfied in grains with @xmath47 studied in @xcite .",
    "this limit is opposite to the one considered recently in ref .",
    "@xcite where the zeeman splitting was assumed to be the main mechanism of destruction of the cooper pairs .",
