    "the use of stochastic processes in interdisciplinary modelling has a long history dating back at least to bachelier s seminal work in finance  @xcite and encompassing applications to traffic flow  @xcite , biological processes  @xcite and opinion dynamics  @xcite , among others .",
    "often such systems are analysed using a markovian ( or memoryless ) approximation which considerably simplifies the theoretical treatment .",
    "however , within the statistical mechanics community there is much topical interest in characterizing the properties of non - markovian models .",
    "there are many ways to incorporate memory effects including generalized langevin or fokker - planck approaches  @xcite , and the assumption of internal variables or non - exponential waiting times in many - particle microscopic models  @xcite . at the random walk level , recent analytical studies in the physics literature",
    "have included the imaginatively named `` elephant '' random walker who remembers a property of the entire history  @xcite , the `` alzheimer '' random walker who recalls just the distant past  @xcite , and `` bold '' and `` timorous '' random walkers who behave differently only when they are at the furthest point ever attained  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the elephant random walk can also be related to the older plya urn problem  @xcite ; see  @xcite for a mathematical review of this and other random processes with reinforcement . amongst the more recent rigorous results",
    "are some for the `` excited '' ( or `` cookie '' ) random walk  @xcite , random walks with different kinds of self - interaction  @xcite , and those with internal states  @xcite .    in real - life social and economic scenarios the dependence on memory is , of course ,",
    "rather complex .",
    "however , one psychological heuristic is the `` peak - end rule '' suggested by kahneman et al .",
    "this asserts that the remembered utility ( loosely speaking the pleasure or pain experienced ) of a specific situation / episode is approximately given by the average of the peak experience ( best or worst ) during the event and the final experience of that event .",
    "notice in particular that this implies `` duration neglect ''  @xcite in the sense that the extreme and final snapshots are considerably more important in the memory than the overall length of the experience ( even if it is an unpleasant one ! ) . empirical support for this peak - end approximation comes from situations ranging from the pain of medical procedures  @xcite to the pleasure of material goods  @xcite . whilst other work paints a more complicated picture , particularly for extended events  @xcite ,",
    "it is clear that peak experiences play an important role and , to the best of our knowledge , such memory of extreme values is largely unexplored from the perspective of statistical physics .    in this spirit ,",
    "our contribution is to consider a random walk model where the probability of moving left or right depends on the maximum value of a random variable associated to each time step .",
    "as we will show , this can be thought of as a simple discrete choice model with a dependence on the `` peak '' of past experience . in particular",
    ", we use this framework to investigate whether increased noise in the model ( corresponding perhaps to the `` churn '' of changing circumstances or some kind of disruption , cf .",
    "e.g. ,  @xcite ) , always leads to more switching between decisions . using the mathematics of extreme values ,",
    "we show that the answer to this question depends on the distribution of the random variable encoding the experience at each step .",
    "our work thus helps to shed light on real - world issues as well as contributing to building up general understanding of memory effects in statistical mechanics models .",
    "the remainder of the paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "[ s : setup ] we describe our random walk formalism and explain its significance as an opinion choice model as well as the manner in which it extends previous work on generalized plya urns . in section  [",
    "s : extreme ] we employ extreme value theory to develop a heuristic argument for different classes of long - time behaviour depending on the distribution of past experience , and compare our predictions with simulations .",
    "finally , in section  [ s : dis ] , we conclude with a discussion of implications and open questions .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional random walker who steps right or left in discrete time , denoting by @xmath0 the number of steps right up to time @xmath1 and @xmath2 the corresponding number left .",
    "note that @xmath3 by construction . for later convenience",
    ", we also define the corresponding time averages ( `` velocities '' ) @xmath4 and @xmath5 , suppressing the notational dependence on @xmath1 where no confusion should arise .",
    "in addition , at each time step @xmath6 we associate an independent identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "random variable @xmath7 from some known distribution with cumulative distribution function ( c.d.f . ) @xmath8 .",
    "crucially , the walker `` remembers '' the maximum value of @xmath7 for all rightward steps in its history and , separately , the maximum value of @xmath7 for all leftward steps .",
    "we denote these history - dependent random variables by @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively so that formally we have @xmath11 memory is then built into the dynamics via the setting of left and right hopping probabilities for the next step to depend on the current values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "it is clear that the system is non - markovian in position space although , of course , still markovian in an enlarged state space including @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the central idea is that this set - up is analogous to a single agent in a discrete decision model where @xmath14 is some kind of `` utility '' and the agent remembers its extreme value ( corresponding to the `` peak '' part of kahneman s peak - end rule ) for each of two choices .",
    "specifically , we fix the right and left stepping probabilities as functions of the random variables @xmath12 and @xmath13 to accord with the familiar `` logit '' choices of economic theory @xmath15 where the positive parameter @xmath16 represents the level of noise in the decision .",
    "is chosen here to reinforce the analogy with temperature in a physical system and is not to be confused with a time parameter ; the update probabilities   loosely resemble the glauber refreshment formulae for an ising model  @xcite . ] throughout the paper we set @xmath17 so that the two choices ( step directions ) are initially equally likely ; as the system evolves the jump probabilities become asymmetric due to differing values of @xmath12 , and @xmath13 . in particular , note that @xmath12 and @xmath13 are monotonically increasing with the number of steps right and left respectively .",
    "in passing , we note here that if @xmath18 were deterministic functions of the velocities @xmath19 the model would closely resemble the plya urn problem , familiar in the mathematics literature  @xcite , where the probability of selecting a ball of a particular colour depends on the fraction of that colour chosen previously ( in a similar manner , the elephant random walker of  @xcite steps left and right with probabilities depending on the relative number of such steps in his past ) . if , as here , the probability function is nonlinear , the urn model is known as a generalized plya process  @xcite .",
    "the crucial difference in our model is that @xmath18 fluctuate in a correlated way due to the statistics of the extreme values  we seek to determine the effect this has on long - time properties such as the average velocity of the random walker ( or , equivalently , the proportion of time the agent makes each decision ) .",
    "one might naively expect that , as for the plya models , in the large @xmath1 limit our random walker approaches a fixed - point state where the relative probabilities ( and hence the fraction of steps left and right ) do not change .",
    "the symmetry of   suggests two specific types of fixed point : ( i ) @xmath20 with @xmath12 and @xmath13 asymptotically equal and hence symmetric behaviour of the random walker , i.e. , both choices equally likely in the long run ; ( ii ) @xmath21 or @xmath22 with one of @xmath12 or @xmath13 negligibly small with respect to the other and hence an asymmetric random walker moving only in one direction , i.e. , the agent frozen in one or other choice .",
    "we shall demonstrate the existence of these fixed points more carefully later .",
    "for now , we remark that a pertinent question relates to their stability , in particular , whether the symmetric fixed point @xmath23 can be made stable by increasing the noise",
    ". this could be important for sharing the load between two different choices ( e.g. , two different routes or transport options ) . in the next section",
    ", we address this issue for different distributions of @xmath14 before , in section  [ s : dis ] , considering the added effect of the `` end '' part of the peak - end rule .",
    "the behaviour of the model will obviously depend on the distribution of @xmath14 .",
    "our strategy is first to analyse the typical long - time dynamics by approximating @xmath18 in   by the so - called `` characteristic largest value '' of extreme value theory and then , where relevant , to consider the added effect of fluctuations about this .",
    "the characteristic largest value after @xmath24 trials is defined for a given @xmath8 as the value of @xmath25 at which @xmath26 .",
    "it gives a straightforward way to obtain the scaling of the maximum value and is closely related to other properties of the full distribution  @xcite , as we shall see for various cases in the following subsections .",
    "our approach using the characteristic largest value leads to hopping probabilities depending on the number of left / right steps over the whole previous history and is thus in the spirit of the generalized plya urn models mentioned above or continuous - time analogues with current - dependent hopping rates  @xcite .",
    "one subtlety here is that the resulting probabilities in our model depend directly on the number of steps left and right , @xmath24 , not the fractions , @xmath19 .",
    "depending on the functional form of the characteristic largest value this may introduce an explicit time dependence in the dynamics for @xmath19 as we shall see in some of the subsequent examples .",
    "in fact , since @xmath27 by construction , this procedure enables us for a given utility distribution @xmath8 to write @xmath28 simply in terms of @xmath29 and possibly time @xmath1 .",
    "now , if the random variable @xmath30 takes value @xmath31 , the mean distance moved in the next step is given by the corresponding value of @xmath32 which we denote by @xmath33 .",
    "hence , on average , we expect a `` typical trajectory '' given by the discrete mapping @xmath34 for cases where @xmath33 has no dependence on @xmath1 it is immediately clear from   that fixed points @xmath35 should satisfy @xmath36 and a standard `` cobweb''-type construction predicts that the stability of the fixed points is determined by the slope of the increasing function @xmath37 , see figure  [ f : cobweb ]",
    ".    specifically , if @xmath38 [ figure  [ f : cobweb](a ) ] then small fluctuations below @xmath35 are characterized by @xmath39 , so on average the velocity increases back towards the fixed point .",
    "similarly , fluctuations above @xmath35 have @xmath40 , so on average the velocity decreases , again back towards the fixed point .",
    "an analogous argument shows that fixed points with @xmath41 are unstable [ figure  [ f : cobweb](b ) ] .",
    "notice that due to the time dependence of the mapping   the decay towards fixed points is expected to be power - law rather than exponential in nature ",
    "physically this is because as the measurement time increases the last step has a smaller and smaller effect on the overall time average .    in the following subsections we illustrate this approach for three qualitatively different scenarios corresponding to the three known families of extreme value theory .",
    "( in cases where @xmath33 itself depends on time we shall chiefly be interested in its behaviour as @xmath42 . )",
    "we then confront the predictions with simulation results and discuss how fluctuations in the extreme values modify the picture of typical behaviour given above .",
    "to demonstrate the method , we first look in detail at the case where the utility variable @xmath14 has an exponential distribution with c.d.f.@xmath43 here the characteristic largest value after @xmath24 steps is given by @xmath44 so , substituting for @xmath18 in  , we approximate @xmath28 in the long - time limit by @xmath45 or equivalently , in terms of the time averages , @xmath46 in this particular case , the probabilities can be written in terms of @xmath19 without explicit time dependence illustrating a direct connection to the class of elephant random walker and ( time - homogeneous ) plya urn problems .    to determine the fixed points we further write @xmath28 in terms of the net velocity by substituting @xmath47 to obtain @xmath48",
    "so the function specifying the mean displacement of the next step can be compactly written as @xmath49 where @xmath31 is the current value of the velocity .",
    "the fixed points satisfying @xmath36 are then seen by inspection to be @xmath50 as predicted from symmetry arguments .",
    "recall from the previous subsection that to determine which of these fixed points is stable we need to check the slope @xmath51 ; here it is straightforward to show from   that @xmath52 hence if @xmath53 , the mixed solution @xmath20 is stable and the asymmetric frozen solutions @xmath22 and @xmath21 correspondingly unstable .",
    "similarly , for @xmath54 , the mixed solution is unstable and we predict that the random walker becomes frozen into ballistic motion in one of the two directions . to check this heuristic",
    "argument we appeal to monte carlo simulations  in figure  [ f : expeg ] we show the empirical distribution of velocities at @xmath55 for an exponential utility distribution ( with mean @xmath56 ) and values of noise predicted to correspond to the two different cases ( @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) .     for random walkers with dependence on peak values of exponential utility distribution ( @xmath56 ) and two different noise levels ( @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) .",
    "distribution calculated from @xmath59 trajectories each running up to final time @xmath55.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    we see good qualitative agreement of the simulations with the prediction : in the low - noise case the trajectories are sharply peaked around the asymmetric fixed points , i.e. , @xmath60 ( corresponding to each agent almost always making the same choice ) whilst in the high - noise case the trajectories are clustered around the symmetric fixed point , i.e. , @xmath61 ( corresponding to each agent sampling the two choices approximately equally ) .",
    "however , there is a finite width of the distribution about the fixed point(s ) even for @xmath62 significantly greater than unity  to investigate this more systematically , and reveal possible finite - time effects , we plot in figure  [ f : range ] the standard deviation of the distribution as a function of @xmath16 for increasing measurement times .     for random walkers with dependence on peak values of exponential utility distribution ( @xmath56 ) and range of noise values .",
    "points show simulation results for increasing times ( @xmath63 trajectories in each case ) ; solid line is numerical solution of  ; dashed line is approximation  .,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    this quantifies how close the trajectories end to symmetric or asymmetric fixed points without making a distinction between the two asymmetric states ( whose selection is expected to depend sensitively on the agent s first few choices ) .",
    "according to the analysis of typical behaviour given above , we expect the standard deviation to be unity for @xmath54 and zero for @xmath64 .",
    "in fact , although the simulations do show evidence of a transition around @xmath65 , the situation is somewhat more complicated ; in particular , the standard deviation clearly converges to a finite value even for @xmath64 .",
    "these observed results for the standard deviation @xmath66 suggest that , even in the long - time limit , the properties of the model are sensitive to the full distribution of maximum values not just the characteristic largest value . as further evidence of this , we remark that if @xmath18 _ were _ given deterministically by the characteristic largest value , the variance for @xmath64 could only be due to decay towards the stable fixed point and fluctuation of individual trajectories about the typical behaviour . in this case",
    ", @xmath30 would be expected to obey a large deviation principle with some `` speed '' @xmath67  @xcite and the variance would eventually converge to zero , as confirmed in  [ a : det ] where , for comparative purposes , we present simulation results from an artificial model with @xmath18 at every time step set equal to @xmath44 .",
    "it is clear then that the limiting value of the variance in the full model is determined by fluctuations in the extreme values , leading to fluctuations of the typical trajectories themselves .    in the case of an exponential distribution",
    "it is , of course , well known that the limiting form of the rescaled maximum has a gumbel distribution ; here the c.d.f .",
    "of @xmath18 is asymptotically given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the mode @xmath71 coincides with the characteristic largest value calculated earlier while the mean is @xmath72 ( with @xmath73 the euler - mascheroni constant ) so differs from it only by a constant amount .",
    "taking account of the fluctuations , the maximum value random variables thus obey @xmath74 where the distribution of @xmath75 is given by the difference of the two gumbel distributions as a logistic distribution with mean zero and variance @xmath76 .",
    "substituting the form of   in the expression for @xmath32 and repeating the calculations leading to   one finds that for a given , non - zero , value of @xmath75 the position of the `` symmetric '' fixed point is shifted from zero although both its stability and the position of the asymmetric fixed points remain unchanged .",
    "a crude estimate of the standard deviation in the position of the symmetric fixed point can be obtained as the value of @xmath77 which solves the transcendental equation @xmath78 as seen in figure  [ f : range ] this leads to a loose upper bound on the observed standard deviation .",
    "the actual standard deviation is smaller because the value of @xmath75 and the corresponding fixed point changes during the course of each trajectory . in",
    "[ a : var ] , we include this effect within a linear expansion to obtain an analytical expression for @xmath66 which is a better approximation for @xmath79 large ( see , again , figure  [ f : range ] ) .",
    "notwithstanding the finite variance , the claim that one can control the long - time behaviour by increasing / decreasing the noise is well borne out by simulation .",
    "for example , in figure  [ f : control ] we show the evolution of the standard deviation in a scenario where the noise level ( and hence the stability of the fixed points ) is abruptly changed after the first 500 time steps .     against time for random walkers with dependence on peak values of exponential utility distribution ( @xmath56 ) and change in noise level at @xmath80",

    "all calculations from @xmath59 trajectories.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the cornerstone of extreme value theory , the fisher - tippett - gnedenko theorem  @xcite , asserts that the gumbel distribution is universal for the rescaled maximum of i.i.d .",
    "random variables drawn from a distribution with exponential tails . however , the functional form of the scaling parameters depends on the distribution being considered . as a second example",
    ", we now make the arguably reasonable hypothesis that agents assign utilities according to a gaussian with some mean @xmath86 and standard deviation @xmath87 .",
    "the mode of the limiting distribution , again given by the characteristic largest value , is @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the c.d.f .  of the standard normal distribution .",
    "we note that , in this case , @xmath71 retains a logarithmic dependence on @xmath24 growing like @xmath90 as @xmath91 . ignoring the fluctuations about this value ,",

    "however , since the dependence is only logarithmic in  @xmath1 , one still expects to see a noise - controlled transition for large but finite times .",
    "this is supported by the simulation results for standard deviation shown in figure  [ f : rangeg ] .",
    "for comparison , we have set there the first two moments equal to those of the exponential distribution in figure  [ f : range ] and the picture for the gaussian case is qualitatively similar with the transition between low and high - noise regimes only weakly dependent on @xmath1 .",
    "but for gaussian utility distribution ( @xmath95 , @xmath96 ) .",
    ", scaledwidth=80.0% ]    to complete the story , we can again consider fluctuations of the maximum values . in this case , the width of the gumbel distribution is controlled by @xmath97 which decays to zero as @xmath91 ( again see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "hence , in contrast to the exponential case , we do not expect a finite limiting velocity variance in the high - noise regime and indeed the relevant simulation data do seem to show a slow convergence towards zero .",
    "a similar argument applies to other distributions with exponential tails  the characteristic largest value of @xmath18 converges to the mode of the corresponding gumbel distribution and generically grows as @xmath98 where the power @xmath99 determines the long - time stability of the symmetric fixed point via @xmath100 the exponential distribution   corresponds to the special case of @xmath101 , while for @xmath102 we expect long - term stability of the symmetric fixed point ( @xmath103 ) and , for @xmath104 we expect long - term instability ( @xmath105 ) . for intermediate timescales",
    ", the system can be driven towards either the symmetric mixed state or the asymmetric frozen state by increasing or decreasing the noise , as we demonstrate for the gaussian distribution in figure  [ f : controlg ] .",

    "note that in the low - to - high noise case with these parameters , two peaks are still visible in the velocity histogram at @xmath85 ; they are a residual effect from the first 500 time steps and merge if the final time is further increased .",

    "in fact , in the limit @xmath42 , @xmath33 approaches the step function @xmath114 with corresponding stable fixed points at @xmath115 .    in this pareto case , it is straightforward to show that for large @xmath24 the maximum value @xmath18 has approximately a frchet c.d.f.@xmath116 where the scale parameter @xmath117 is given by @xmath109 .",
    "the mean of this distribution is only finite for @xmath118 but the mode and the median are both proportional to @xmath117 so , again , the trivially calculated characteristic largest value should give a good indication of the long - time behaviour .",

    "we emphasize that , since the fixed point at @xmath93 is always stable except for very short times , the long - time behaviour of the system can not be effectively controlled by altering the noise ( confirmed by further simulations , not shown ) .",

    "furthermore , for the special case of @xmath147 decay , even in the high - noise regime there is a finite variance around the mixed state which can be attributed to fluctuations in the maximum values .",
    "significantly , this implies that only for exponential - tailed utility distributions can one hope to increase the switching between decisions on intermediate / long timescales simply by increasing the noise .    from a statistical physics point of view",
    ", it would be interesting in the exponential case to characterize the phase transition and scaling exponents at @xmath148 , e.g. , by calculating the correlation function .",
    "this latter is also relevant in the opinion dynamics context as it quantifies how sensitive the long - time behaviour is to the first step and thus the extent to which a particular one of the two asymmetric fixed points might be favoured by a small initial perturbation .",
    "preliminary simulations suggest that the correlation function in the full model converges to zero for @xmath64 and , for @xmath149 , decreases more strongly with @xmath62 than in the artificial model of  [ a : det ] ( presumably due to the added fluctuations reducing the effect of the initial conditions ) .",
    "however , a more detailed analysis with finite - time scaling along the lines of  @xcite is deferred to a future publication .    other extensions of",
    "the work might include considering coupled random walkers ( modelling collective rather than individual memory ) or peak effects in other opinion dynamics models , such as contact processes and voter models  @xcite .",
    "the peak - end rule itself can also be critiqued ( see , e.g. , the discussion in  @xcite ) and realistic refinements such as the slow fading of peak memories in the distant past could be incorporated into the modelling .",
    "however , we believe that our current work represents an important first step beyond simply averaging over the whole past experience or just recalling the most recent history .    although our analytical calculations thus far have been carried out in the framework of a specific toy model they highlight more generally the possible role of ( experienced or remembered ) utility distributions in maintaining and controlling behaviour . in particular ,",
    "if agents are encouraged to reflect on their own experiences with a view to possibly modifying future choices then the outcome could be subtlely dependent on any numerical scale offered for reflection , e.g. , whether or not it has a fixed upper bound .",
    "there is much scope here for future interdisciplinary work linking with current understanding in psychology and economics .",
    "this research was carried out as part of the project _ reflect  a feasibility study in experienced utility and travel behaviour _ funded by research councils uk ( ep / j004715/1 ) . the culmination of the work also benefited from the kind hospitality of the galileo galilei institute for theoretical physics ( ggi ) florence and the national institute for theoretical physics ( nithep ) stellenbosch . the author wishes to thank jennifer roberts and hugo touchette for many helpful discussions as well as comments on a draft manuscript .",
    "raw data underlying the figures shown here is stored in the queen mary research online repository ( http://dx.doi.org/10.17636/01007419 ) .",
    "here we present a brief analysis of a simplified model in which @xmath18 at every time step is deterministically given by @xmath44 ( the characteristic largest value of an exponential distribution with @xmath24 trials ) . in this case , the future hopping rates are completely determined by the past velocity so previous work on generalized plya urn models , etc",
    ".  should be directly applicable .",
    "the standard deviation against noise in this case is shown in figure  [ f : prange ] which is to be compared with figure  [ f : range ] in the main text .",
    "but for simplified model ( still with @xmath56 ) . , scaledwidth=80.0% ]    for the artificial model , the standard deviation _ does _ appear to converge to unity for @xmath54 and zero for @xmath64 as predicted by the analysis of typical trajectories outlined in section  [ ss : method ] . in figure",
    "[ f : decay ] we examine on log - log scale the limiting behaviour for selected points in the high - noise regime and clearly see a power - law decay .",
    "in fact , the asymptotic behaviour of the variance can be predicted on general grounds to depend on the slope @xmath51 at the stable fixed point ( cf .  @xcite for the continuous - time case ) .",
    "specifically , as found in other models  @xcite , one anticipates a dynamical phase transition at @xmath150 with diffusive fluctuations ( i.e. , @xmath151 decay of the velocity standard deviation ) for @xmath152 and superdiffusive behaviour ( with @xmath153 decay ) for @xmath154 . setting @xmath155",
    ", the resulting predictions indeed fit the simulation data very well ( with logarithmic corrections expected at the dynamical phase transition itself ) .",
    "note that this provides a quantitative explanation for the observed slow convergence close to the transition point ( @xmath65 ) which may also be relevant in the full model .     against time for random walkers in simplified model ( @xmath56 ) at selected noise values ( @xmath156 trajectories in each case ) .",
    "points are simulation data for ( top to bottom ) : @xmath157 .",
    "black solid lines are fits corresponding to power laws with negative exponent @xmath158 ; logarithmic corrections are expected at @xmath159.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    another important quantity for generalized plya processes such as this is the correlation function @xmath160 between the direction of the first step and the @xmath161th step  @xcite .",
    "the long - time limit of this quantity plays the role of an order parameter and simulation results in the present case ( not shown ) confirm a continuous phase transition at @xmath148 with @xmath160 converging to zero for all @xmath162 .",
    "to understand the fluctuations of the velocity , one needs to take account of the fact that each value of @xmath18 persists for a number of time steps before being replaced by a larger one . in this appendix",
    ", we pursue such an approach with an exponential utility distribution to obtain an approximation for the long - time limit of the standard deviation in the high - noise regime .",
    "we let @xmath163 be the time at which the last record occurred ( i.e. , the last change in either @xmath12 or @xmath13 up to the current time @xmath1 ) and note that , by definition , the value of @xmath32 is unchanged for @xmath164 . in the exponential case @xmath165",
    "is given by   and typical trajectories should then obey the _ stochastic _",
    "mapping @xmath166 where @xmath163 and @xmath75 are random variables and the second term in the numerator gives the expected displacement since the last record . in the case where @xmath167 and @xmath168 for all time ( i.e. , @xmath12 or @xmath13 updated at every step with no fluctuations ) we recover the deterministic mapping of   with  . in slight abuse of notation ,",
    "we denote a typical trajectory by @xmath169 even in the present stochastic case and argue that it is the fluctuations of this trajectory which lead to the long - time variance of @xmath30 .    for large times we can approximate @xmath170 and @xmath171 ( time - averaged velocity changes slowly ) which allows us to write @xmath172 with @xmath173 the fraction @xmath174 . to proceed further",
    "we then make three key assumptions :    1 .",
    "[ a : linear ] @xmath175 and @xmath176 are sufficiently small that we can approximate the @xmath177 term by a linear function",
    "[ a : uniform ] the @xmath178 right steps ( and therefore also the @xmath179 left steps ) are uniformly distributed throughout the trajectory .",
    "[ a : indep ] @xmath180 , @xmath75 and @xmath173 are mutually independent .",
    "all three of these assumptions are expected to fail as @xmath62 approaches 1 but they do facilitate analytical progress for @xmath181 .",
    "first , we use assumption  ( [ a : linear ] ) to make a linear expansion @xmath182 and trivially rearrange to obtain @xmath183 where for convenience we have rescaled to @xmath184 which has a standard logistic distribution with variance @xmath185 . to obtain the distribution of @xmath173",
    ", we first consider separately the fractional times @xmath186 and @xmath187 for the last records corresponding to right and left steps respectively .",
    "each of the @xmath24 previous steps is equally likely to have produced the maximum value so , with assumption  ( [ a : uniform ] ) , we have @xmath188 in the long - time limit .",
    "then , by straightforward calculation , @xmath189 is governed by a triangular distribution on @xmath190 $ ] with mode 1 .",
    "now , in the long - time limit , we expect the distribution of @xmath180 to be the same as that of @xmath169 , both characterized by standard deviation @xmath66 . hence using the independence assumption  ( [ a : indep ] ) , together with the symmetry of trajectories around zero , we obtain @xmath191 where the functions @xmath192 and @xmath193 are given by expectations with respect to the distribution of @xmath173 : @xmath194 & = x\\left[-2 + 9x-6x^2 + 6x(x-1)^2\\ln\\left(\\frac{x}{x-1}\\right)\\right ] , \\\\",

    "specifically , @xmath197 approximates @xmath198 to within 10% for @xmath199 so , since @xmath169 and @xmath75 are fairly strongly correlated , we require @xmath200 which is satisfied for @xmath201 . indeed   is seen to provide a reasonable approximation to the simulation data in this regime ( cf .",
    "figure  [ f : range ] ) .",
