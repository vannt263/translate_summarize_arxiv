    "as soon as the source became observable with _ bepposax _ , we started a target of opportunity ( too ) observational program devoted to study the spectral properties of the source . here",
    "we present results of the first observation performed on 2000 april 1415 . in figure 1 we show the epochs of the source observations with _ bepposax_.",
    "mcclintock et al .  ( 2000 ) , m01a and wagner et al .  ( 2000 ) have recently detected absorption lines of an m0m1 v star in their red optical spectra obtained when the object was in a quiescent state .",
    "the weighted average of their measurements of the velocity amplitude for the secondary is @xmath23 km s@xmath12 , which yields the mass function of @xmath24 for @xmath25 days ( where @xmath26 is the inclination ) .    at the same time , garnavich ( 2000 ; see also m01a ) found a double sinusoidal variation with a peak - to - peak amplitude of 0.15 mag in the @xmath27-band light curve phased to the 0.17-day period .",
    "this suggests that the secondary is tidally distorted .    in systems with mass ratios of @xmath28 , the average density of a roche lobe - filling secondary",
    "is determined solely by the orbital period , which implies simple period  mass  radius  spectral type relations for lower main sequence ( ms ) secondaries ( frank , king , & raine 1992 ) . in the case of xte 1118 + 480",
    ", the orbital period implies a spectral type of m2 and a mass of @xmath29 for a ms secondary with near - solar metallicity , whereas a star with lower metallicity would have somewhat earlier spectral type ( e.g.beuermann et al .",
    "an evolved secondary would have a spectral type significantly later than that of a zero - age ms star with the same density ( i.e. , in a binary with the same orbital period ) and a lower mass ( e.g.baraffe & kolb 2000 ) . if the secondary is a ms star with @xmath30 , equation ( [ mass_function ] ) yields @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "the lack of dips or eclipses for a roche - lobe filling secondary , in particular in the x - ray light curve ( revnivtsev et al .",
    "2000 ) , yields an upper limit for the inclination of @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "the light curve presented in fig .",
    "1 of m01a shows some deviations from a purely ellipsoidal light curve .",
    "first , it shows some extra light at @xmath35 after the inferior conjunction of the secondary , which , according to m01a can be explained by a bright spot at the edge of accretion disk .",
    "there is also a phase lag of 0.05 relative to the spectroscopic ephemeris , which makes the ellipsoidal nature of the light curve somewhat problematic .",
    "on the other hand , m01a found a significant contamination of the visual light by an accretion disk , which likely contaminates also the infrared light . in this case , eclipse effects in an extended disk can possibly shift the phase of the light curve .",
    "thus , we follow m01a and assume that the light curve is dominated by ellipsoidal effects . the amplitude of the double sinusoid is then positively correlated with @xmath36 , @xmath26 , and the roche - lobe filling factor .",
    "moreover , the two minima of the ellipticity effect are in general unequal , the one corresponding to the superior conjuntion of the distorted star being deeper than the other .",
    "the magnitude difference between the two minima is a function of @xmath26 and the filling factor . in particular , for a roche - lobe filling star , this difference should be about 0.1 mag for @xmath37 decreasing almost linearly to 0 at @xmath38 .",
    "the light curve presented by m01a shows the shallower minimum at the inferior conjunction ( as expected ) of @xmath39 , and the magnitude difference between the two minima of @xmath40 , indicating @xmath41 . on the other hand , for @xmath31 and a roche - lobe filling star with convective envelope , we estimate the amplitude of the shallower minimum to be @xmath42 mag , which suggests much lower inclination , @xmath43 .",
    "this shows that the amplitude of the ellipsoidal variability is reduced due to contamination of the @xmath27-band flux by some additional contribution from other source(s ) , e.g.  an accretion disk .",
    "m01a found that the secondary contributes @xmath44 ( k5v ) to @xmath45 ( m1v ) of the total flux at 5900  . to evaluate a contribution of the accretion disk at the @xmath27-band",
    ", we assume that the local disk spectrum corresponds to either @xmath46 or @xmath47 being constant .",
    "assuming an m1m2 secondary , we estimate the contribution of the disk as @xmath48 and @xmath49 , in the first and second case , respectively .",
    "then , the following equations can be used to determine @xmath36 , @xmath26 , and the binary separation , @xmath50 .",
    "kepler s third law reads , @xmath51 the secondary s radial velocity amplitude , @xmath52 km / s , corresponds to @xmath53 the full ( peak - to - peak ) amplitude produced by the tidal distortion is @xmath54 where @xmath55 corresponds to the `` transverse radius '' of the secondary , which is about 96% of the mean radius , @xmath56 , of its roche lobe .",
    "the numerical coefficient in equation ( [ eq : delta ] ) was evaluated from synthetic @xmath27-band light curves generated with the wilson - devinney code ( wilson 1990 ) using a gravity - darkening exponent of 0.32 , a linear limb - darkening coefficient of 0.6 , and using the shallower minimum in the synthetic light curve .",
    "assuming a ms secondary with @xmath57 and @xmath58 , we obtain @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 in the cases with constant @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "the first solution produces equal minima , which is not observed , whereas the second one results in a too shallow second minimum .    on the other hand ,",
    "the presence of extra light near the first minimum will reduce its depth , whereas the second minimum may be not affected . using only the depth of the second minimum , we get @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 in the first case , and a solution similar to that of m01a , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , in the second case .",
    "note that the first solution still produces equal minima in the light curve .",
    "we note that the determinations of the binary parameters by m01a and above supersede analogous constraints of dubus et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , obtained before the recent measurements of @xmath75 .",
    "those authors used instead the peak - to - peak separation of very broad double - peaked hi balmer and heii 4686 emission lines , measured by them as @xmath76 , 1470 km / s , respectively .",
    "they then assumed that @xmath77 represents the projected keplerian velocity of the outer disk , and used a theoretical value of its radius , @xmath78 .",
    "for a keplerian disk with a power - law emissivity , the relation , @xmath79 is satisfied ( e.g.  smak 1981 ) .",
    "however , with the measured @xmath75 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 for the balmer and heii lines , respectively .",
    "this implies @xmath82 for any value of @xmath36 , which then appears to invalidate their adopted assumption of a keplerian outer disk .",
    "summarizing , the present most likely range of the mass and inclination is @xmath83 the lower and upper limit on @xmath26 follow from the unequal light - curve minima and the lack of eclipses , respectively .",
    "the presence of the m12 v star with @xmath84 ( m01a ) implies the distance of @xmath85 where the error also takes into account the uncertainty in the interstellar absorption ( see below ) .",
    "we also assumed @xmath869.9 for such a ms star with near - solar metallicity ( baraffe & chabrier 1996 ) .",
    "note that @xmath87 will become lower for lower metallicity ( beuermann et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "an accurate determination of the hydrogen column density , @xmath88 , is of key importance for determining the correct spectral model for the source emission . given the high galactic latitude of the source , the total galactic column density along the source direction is likely to be close to @xmath88 , as well as it represents an upper limit to it .",
    "the galactic column density of hi has been measured in radio in 5 directions within @xmath89 of the direction of the optical counterpart , yielding the range of @xmath90@xmath91 @xmath92 ( dickey & lockman 1990 , as implemented in the ftools software package ) .",
    "the measurement in the direction closest ( @xmath93 ) to that of xte  j1118 + 480  gives @xmath94 @xmath92 , and the average weighted by the angular distance from the source direction is @xmath95 @xmath92 .",
    "we note that , at these low values of @xmath88 , absorption is effective only at soft x - rays , at which hi is indeed the main absorbing species . a lower galactic column density ( @xmath96 @xmath92 ) along the line of sight is derived following schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) , who obtained full ",
    "sky dust maps on the basis of the _ cobe _ and _ iras _ satellite data .",
    "the uncertainty in their reddening maps is estimated to be about 16% . taking into account that the @xmath88 value along the line of sight , obtained by interpolation from these and hi maps , can differ from the real value by a factor @xmath97 ( faison et al .",
    "1998 ) , we can state that the above @xmath88 estimates are consistent each other .",
    "then , dubus et al .  ( 2001 ) have found 3 weak absorption features ( caii 3933  doublet and 3968  ) , interpreted as coming from 3 interstellar clouds in the line of sight moving at different velocities . from best - fitting , they obtain the total @xmath98 @xmath92 ( without giving its uncertainty ) .",
    "they then convert this value to @xmath88 using an average range of @xmath998.5 obtained for high - altitude lines of sight ( sembach & danks 1994 ) .",
    "this yields @xmath88 in the range of ( 1.76@xmath100 @xmath92 .",
    "we note , however , that it is sufficient that the actual @xmath101 ratio in the direction of xte  j1118 + 480  is just @xmath102 less than the lower limit of the above _ average _ ratio range to achieve the consistency of @xmath88 from radio mapping of hi with that from caii .",
    "in fact , the h and k lines of caii correlate poorly with @xmath88 in general and are thus considered not suitable for the purpose of accurate determination of @xmath88 ( dickey & lockman 1990 and references therein ) .",
    "on the other hand , hynes et al .",
    "( 2000 ) obtained @xmath88 in the range of ( 0.35@xmath103 @xmath92 by fitting their 0.10.2 kev _ euve _ spectrum by a power law with a range of indices .",
    "we note that such narrow - band fits appear to be easily subject to systematic errors due to the possibility that the actual spectrum is not a power law .",
    "our _ bepposax _ data include this range , and we have found @xmath104@xmath105 @xmath92 by fitting a range of models .",
    "power - law models gave lower values of @xmath88 , consistent with hynes et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , but models with blackbody and comptonized blackbody spectra gave higher @xmath88 , consistent with the measurements of dickey & lockman ( 1990 ) .",
    "given the results above , we consider the most likely range of @xmath88 to be @xmath106@xmath107 @xmath92 .",

    "1997 ) , a high pressure gas scintillator proportional counter ( hpgspc , 3100 kev , manzo et al .",

    "the lecs and mecs have imaging capabilities , while the hpgspc and pds are collimated detectors with a field of view ( fov ) of @xmath108 and @xmath109 , respectively .",
    "the pds instrument makes use of rocking collimators for background monitoring .",
    "we observed the source from 2000 april 14.489  ut to 15.528  ut .",
    "the source exposure times were 21197  s , 29758  s , 42138  s , and 20146  s for the lecs , mecs , hpgspc and pds , respectively .",
    "useful data were selected from time intervals that met the following criteria : the satellite outside the south atlantic geomagnetic anomaly , the elevation angle above the earth limb by @xmath110 , dark earth ( for lecs ) , stabilized high voltage supplies .",
    "the source was detected with all the nfis , from @xmath1110.1 to 200  kev .",
    "the lecs and mecs source spectra were extracted from a region with a radius of @xmath112 around the centroid of the source image . as background spectra",
    "we used standard files obtained from the observation of blank fields .",
    "the 2 mecs spectra were equalized and co - added .",
    "we used background spectra accumulated from dark earth data for the hpgspc ( note that the instrument s collimator was kept on the source for the entire observation ) .",
    "the background level of the pds was estimated by swapping its collimators off source every 96 s. the energy bands used for spectral fitting were limited to those where the response functions were best known , i.e , 0.124 kev , 1.710 kev , 729 kev , and 15200 kev , for the lecs , mecs , hpgspc and pds , respectively .",
    "the count rate spectra were analyzed using the xspec software package @xcite .",
    "a systematic error of 1% was added in quadrature to the statistical uncertainties of the spectral data , on the basis of the calibration results obtained with the crab nebula , that was observed 4 days before our observation ( 10 april 2000 ) .",
    "we allowed for free normalization of the instruments in multi - instrument fits with respect to mecs .",
    "for clarity of display , the unfolded spectra from multi - instrument fits were renormalized to the mecs level .",
    "the results below have been obtained with the spectra averaged over the entire observation .",
    "we have also performed a spectral analysis on different time intervals , but have not found any statistically significant variation of the best - fit parameters with time .",
    "the quoted errors for the spectral parameters correspond to 90% confidence for one parameter ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "the elemental abundances are with respect to those of anders & ebihara ( 1982 ) , and the opacities are from morrison & mccammon ( 1983 ) . in calculations of compton reflection and in comptonization models in planar geometry ,",
    "we assume an inclination of @xmath114 ( see  [ pars ] ) .",
    "the 0.1200  kev count rate spectrum obtained with the nfis ( see figure [ f : pl ] , top panel ) was fit with different models .",
    "a simple power - law model ( pl ) with @xmath115 @xmath92 ( see  [ nh ] ) gives an unacceptable fit with the photon index , @xmath116 , and a very large @xmath117 , caused mostly by strong systematic residuals at the lowest and highest energies , corresponding to a soft x - ray excess at @xmath118 kev and a high - energy cutoff at @xmath119 kev , respectively , as shown in the bottom panel of figure [ f : pl ] .",
    "the high energy cutoff is also apparent from figure [ f : crab_ratio ] , where we show the ratio of the xte  j1118 + 480 spectrum measured by the pds with the corresponding one of the crab nebula , which was observed for cross - calibration purposes 4 days before our observation . replacing the power law with an e - folded power law ( cutoffpl ) and maintaining the @xmath88 value fixed to @xmath94",
    "@xmath92 only marginally improve the fit ( @xmath120 ) : the systematic residuals at low and high energies are still there ( see figure [ f : pl ] ) , and the best fit cut  off energy",
    "is very high and unconstrained . only allowing a free @xmath88 the fit does improve significantly , to @xmath121 , but only for an @xmath122@xmath92 , about a half of @xmath123 , even if consistent with the @xmath88 based on the dust ir maps (  [ nh ] ) .",
    "however still there remain strong systematic residuals at the lowest and highest energies , as confirmed by the still unacceptable @xmath124 .",
    "thus we added to the previous model a blackbody spectrum ( bb ) . with this additional component",
    "the fit quality significantly increased ( @xmath125 ) , with a chance probability that the lower @xmath124 is due to chance of @xmath126 . even if the cutoffpl model component is not the best description of the high energy cut  off ( see below ) , it represents a great improvement with respect to a pl component , that gives a much worse and unacceptable quality of the fit ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "this result confirms the statistical significance of the high energy cut  off in our data . the best fit model with bb plus cutoffpl provides an @xmath88 close to @xmath123 with a rather low temperature ( @xmath128 ev ) of the bb spectrum , see table 1 .",
    "figure [ f : cutoffpl ] shows the best fit curve along with the residuals of the data to the model .",
    "[ t : table1 ]    still , even the last fit shows strong systematic residuals at the highest energies , as an e - folded power law does not reproduce the actual shape of the high - energy cutoff in the data .",
    "therefore , we have tested models with the main continuum component given by comptonization , a common physical process in compact sources ( see zdziarski 2000 for a review ) .",
    "we first consider the thermal - compton model ( comptt ) of titarchuk ( 1994 ) , in which a wien spectrum undergoes scattering in either spherical or slab geometry , and relativistic effects are taken into account . we have found that fits with very similar electron temperature , @xmath129 , and @xmath124 are obtained for either geometry .",
    "similarly to the case of an e - folded power law , the absorbed comptt model yields an implausibly low @xmath130 ( @xmath131 @xmath92 ) with a @xmath132 , similar to that found with the last model ( bb plus cutoffpl ) . adding an absorbed bb component , with @xmath133 equal to the temperature of the seed photons , the best fit @xmath88 is closer to @xmath123 , even though the fit quality does not improve ( @xmath134 or 280/227 according to the geometry of the electron cloud , a sphere or a slab , respectively ; see table 1 for the sphere ) .",
    "the cause of it is that the derived electron temperature , @xmath135 kev for a sphere and @xmath136  kev for a slab , is too much large to account for the observed cutoff at an energy of @xmath1 kev ( see also figure [ f : comptt ] ) .",
    "then we tested the thermal - compton model ( compps v3.4 ) of poutanen & svensson ( 1996 ) .",
    "the advantage of this model is that , in addition to allow for different geometries of the electron cloud , it allows for the presence of compton reflection ( magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) from a cold medium ( like an accretion disk ) with variable element abundances with respect to the solar ones .",
    "we considered spherical or slab geometries with blackbody seed photons distributed homogeneously in the plasma and the thomson optical depth , @xmath137 , corresponding to the radius or the half - thickness , respectively .",
    "initially we assumed reflection from a medium with solar abundances .",
    "for consistency , we also allowed for a narrow gaussian line ( @xmath138 kev ) at 6.4 kev . in the spherical geometry and allowing the presence of additional blackbody photons ( apart from those irradiating the plasma ) , we find @xmath139 at @xmath140 kev , see table 1 .",
    "thus the best fit provides a lower value of the electron temperature , that allows a better description of the observed high energy cutoff with respect to the comptt model obtained with compps are much lower from that derived from comptt , which is caused by inaccuracies in the shape of the high - energy cutoff in the latter model , see , e.g. , zdziarski , johnson , & magdziarz ( 1996 ) .",
    "] , see figure [ f : compps ] .",
    "an f - test for 2 additional parameters provides a value of @xmath141 for the probability that the @xmath124 reduction from bb + comptt to bb + compps is due to chance .",
    "similarly we can not exclude the slab geometry for the same model , that provides a statistically similar fit , @xmath142 , even if the latter model seems to show in correspondence of the 150200 kev data point a positive residual that is not observed in the case of the spherical geometry ( see figure  [ f : compps ] ) .",
    "no evidence of relative reflection was found with the above model in both geometries , with a 2@xmath143 upper limit of @xmath1110.16 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "this result , caused by the absence of an fe k edge , contrasts other black black hole binaries in the hard state ( e.g. , gierliski et al .",
    "1997 ) . to check the robustness of the absence of reflection ,",
    "we first consider the dependence on the inclination .",
    "we find no evidence of relative reflection even at @xmath144 ( about the maximum allowed by the data ,  [ pars ] ) with a @xmath145 upper limit of 0.26 .",
    "also no evidence of a narrow fe k line is found in the data , with a @xmath145 upper limit of the line intensity of @xmath146 photons  @xmath92  s@xmath12 with energy from 6.4 to 6.9 kev , independently of the geometry adopted ( see table  1 ) .",
    "a low metal abundance , @xmath147 , of the reflecting medium is expected for halo stars , like xte j1118 + 480 .",
    "spectrally , it has an effect of reducing the k edge in the reflected spectral component without changing the shape of its high - energy cutoff .",
    "we find that allowing for @xmath148 only slightly improves the fit bringing @xmath149 to 247/225 ( 246/225 ) in the spherical ( slab ) geometry .",
    "table 1 shows the best fit parameters in both geometrical configurations .",
    "we are not capable to discriminate between these geometries .",
    "we now observe a statistically significant compton reflection , similar to the upper limits found when @xmath150 was fixed to 1 .",
    "we notice that the comptonization parameters are slightly lower than those found with cyg x-1 in the hard state ( gierliski et al .",
    "1997 ) , in the assumption of a single temperature isotropic model .",
    "the fit with variable @xmath147 is shown in figure [ f : efe ] , which also shows the remaining small residuals .",
    "we have also considered a multi - component model consisting of the compps model in which the spectrum of seed photons peaks below the observed range ( @xmath151 fixed at 10 ev ) , plus an additional bb component plus the narrow gaussian profile ( see above ) at 6.4  kev .",
    "such a low energy of seed photons is expected , e.g. , when comptonization of thermal synchrotron emission dominates ( e.g.  wardziski & zdziarski 2000 ) , see  [ theory ] .",

    "leaving the metallicity free to vary , we have also tested for the effect of replacing the blackbody spectrum by a disk blackbody , in this case assuming the seed photons for comptonization to be also those of the disk blackbody .",
    "this model yields plasma parameters very similar to the blackbody case above and a similar fit quality ( @xmath155 for a slab and @xmath156 for a sphere ) .",
    "the inner disk temperature is @xmath157 ev at an inner radius greater than @xmath111500  km ( scaled at @xmath158 ) , that corresponds to @xmath159 ( @xmath160 ) , assuming @xmath161 .",
    "the absorbing columns fitted in models using compps are close the galactic @xmath88 , with some absorption intrinsic to the source possible as well .",
    "we note that the value of @xmath162 @xmath92 favored by dubus et al .",
    "( 2001 ) is inconsistent with our data , yielding , e.g. , @xmath163 in the model with comptonization in the spherical geometry .",
    "this confirms our independent conclusions of  [ nh ] .    from the overall best - fit models , the mean flux level of the source during the observation is @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 , and @xmath167 in the 0.12  kev , 210  kev , 15200  kev , and 0.1200 kev bands , respectively ( normalized to the mecs detector )",
    "the total ( 0.01@xmath168 kev ) flux corrected for absorption is somewhat model - dependent , and it equals to @xmath169  for the bb + compps model in the slab configuration ( @xmath170 free to vary in the fit ) ( see table 1 and fig.[f : efe ] ) .",
    "the absorption - corrected flux of the observed blackbody is @xmath171  to be compared with a flux of @xmath172  due to blackbody photons incident on the hot plasma , i.e. 9% of the total flux ( with an apparent amplification factor of 11 ) .",
    "a temporal analysis of the data with fourier techniques shows that the fractional variation of the source flux in the 0.0150  hz frequency range and the 210  kev energy band is 42% rms , which is consistent with the findings by revnivtsev et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . in the 0.12  kev range ,",
    "the fractional variation is even higher ( 62% rms ) .",
    "also , a qpo with the centroid frequency at @xmath173 hz is apparent in our power spectral density estimate .",
    "we do not find any statistically significant modulation at the optical period of 0.17  day .",

    "this difference is likely to be of instrumental origin , as a similar difference between the pca and other x - ray instruments is commonly found in fits to the crab as well as other sources ( e.g. , gierliski et al .",
    "1999 ; done , madejski , & ycki 2000 ) .    then",
    ", we fit the 3200 kev data with comptonization in the spherical geometry , compton reflection at @xmath177 , and a narrow fe k@xmath11 line .",
    "we obtain @xmath178 at the best fit , confirming the weakness of compton reflection .",
    "however , the fitted electron temperature is somewhat larger than that of the _ bepposax _ data , @xmath179 kev .",
    "we find , however , that if apply a correction of @xmath180 to the model fitted to the pca data , @xmath129 becomes equal to @xmath181 kev , consistent with the values of @xmath129 in table 1 .",
    "the large confidence regions of @xmath129 are due to the limited statistics of the hexte data ( the _ rxte _ observation lasted only a small fraction of the _ bepposax _ one ) .",
    "the fact that the summed _ rxte _",
    "spectra ( covering more than a month elapsed time ) are still described by a power law with no high energy cut  off below @xmath182 kev ( mcclintock et al .",
    "2001 ) could be the result of the evolution of the source spectrum .",
    "in fact our preliminary results of the later 2 observations of the source ( see fig .",
    "1 ) show a decreasing evidence of the high energy cut  off with time ( frontera et al .",
    "2001b ) .    summarizing , also the _ rxte _",
    "data appear to be compatible with the _ bepposax _ ones , especially when the difference in the calibration between the pca and _ bepposax _ is taken into account .",
    "the eddington luminosity at an h mass fraction of 0.7 can be written as @xmath183 and the gravitational radius is @xmath184 the total x - ray luminosity corrected for absorption calculated using the comptonization model shown in fig .",
    "[ f : model ] and assuming isotropy is @xmath185 here we used the estimates for the black hole mass and the source distance (  [ pars ] ) .",
    "we note that the @xmath186 above does not represent the bolometric luminosity of the source , whose @xmath187 spectrum has been observed by hynes et al .",
    "( 2000 ) to have a maximum in the far uv at a level similar to that of the peak at @xmath1 kev .",
    "given their results , the bolometric luminosity can be estimated as @xmath188 .",
    "still , @xmath186 represents the luminosity of the hot plasma flow .",
    "a fundamental issue is the geometry of the source .",
    "the weakness of compton reflection and of blackbody emission poses some contraints .",
    "there are two possible solutions we can envisage .",
    "the direct emission from the accretion disk is smeared by compton scattering in the corona , or the hot gas subtends a small solid angle by a cold medium .    a static disk / corona geometry ( e.g. , haardt & maraschi 1991 ) , similary to the case of cyg x-1 in the hard state ,",
    "can be reconciled with the data , as the large value of @xmath189 would scatter most of the reflection and blackbody emission in the power law continuum .",
    "however , because of the tight coupling of the hot and cold phases , this model can not produce a spectrum as flat as that observed . in principle , a mildly relativistic coronal outflow can alleviate the problem ( beloborodov 1999 ; malzac , beloborodov , & poutanen 2001 ) .    given that , the specific coronal model of merloni , di matteo , & fabian ( 2000 ) has some difficulties .",
    "it can produce a flat spectrum , but , as it postulates magnetic flares in a disk - corona geometry , it predicts the presence of a strong blackbody component about an order of magnitude above that observed , even with relativistic bulk motion of the flares taken into account ( compare their fig .  1 with our fig .",
    "[ f : model ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , the observed spectrum is fully compatible with compton scattering in a hot central disk .",
    "indeed , this is the geometry of our overall best - fit model .",
    "then , the weakness of the blackbody and compton ",
    "reflection components is naturally accounted for by a small solid angle subtended by any cold medium as seen from the hot disk .",
    "an important issue here is the origin of the seed photons .",
    "the weakness of the blackbody corresponds to rather small size of the cold region . in either the blackbody or disk - blackbody model ( see  [ results ] and table 1 )",
    ", the characteristic radius of the blackbody emitter is @xmath190 ( at @xmath191 kpc , @xmath192 ) for our best fit models .",
    "thus , the seed photons can be supplied by an outer cold disk , probably overlapping with the hot one .",
    "another compatible source of seed photons compatible is thermal synchrotron emission of the hot plasma itself ( which naturally produces homogenoeous and isotropic seed photons ) .",
    "then the soft excess found in the data can represent either the peak of the self - absorbed thermal synchrotron emission ( e.g.wardziski & zdziarski 2000 ) or blackbody emission not related to the dominant source of seed photons .",
    "the latter model was found in  [ results ] to provide a good fit to the data .",
    "in fact , wardziski & zdziarski ( 2000 ) have predicted that the thermal synchrotron process is able to dominate the supply of seed photons at an intermediate range of eddington factors , @xmath193 , compatible with the case in xte  j1118 + 480 .    by considering the synchrotron process",
    ", we can constrain the magnetic field strength in the source . the turnover energy , @xmath194 ,",
    "at which the thermal self - absorbed synchrotron emission peaks , is approximately @xmath195 ( wardziski & zdziarski 2000 ) .",
    "this yields a constraint on the magnetic field strength of @xmath196 g , with the approximate equality corresponding to the observed soft excess at @xmath197 kev ( fig .",
    "[ f : model ] ) being due to the turnover peak and no non - thermal electron tail . for lower values of @xmath198 ,",
    "the observed soft excess is due to blackbody emission .",
    "then , the uv data of hynes et al .",
    "( 2000 ) constrain @xmath199 ev .",
    "wardziski & zdziarski ( 2001 ) have found that @xmath194 of equation ( [ e_t ] ) can increase by a factor of @xmath973 in the presence of a weak non - thermal tail beyond the maxwellian electron distribution ( with a corresponding high - energy photon tail observed in cyg x-1 , mcconnell et al .",
    "then , the uv constraint implies @xmath200 g in the absence of a non - thermal tail and @xmath201 g with a tail .",
    "only lower values of the above range of @xmath198 correspond to equipartition in a hot accretion flow with moderately sub - virial ions [ e.g. , eq .  ( 34 ) in wardziski & zdziarski 2000 ] , which indicates that the observed soft x - ray excess is due to a separate blackbody component rather than the turnover peak at @xmath194 . summarizing , @xmath196 g is implied directly by the data , and @xmath202@xmath203 g for the sychrotron process to be the dominant source of seed photons .",
    "the high erratic time variability we find in the soft x - ray band ( as well as in hard x - rays ) points out to the origin of soft x - ray excess in the same spatial region as that occupied by the hot plasma .",
    "this is in agreement with both the seed photons being provided by the blackbody emission of clouds within the hot plasma or their origin from the synchrotron process .",
    "the latter model also agrees with a similar time variability observed in the optical band , as noted by merloni et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .    within the compton scattering model in a hot central disk ,",
    "our data appear compatible with the hot disk being advection - dominated , as recently proposed by esin et al .",
    "( 2001 ) on the basis of near  simultaneous _ hst _ , _ euve _ , _ chandra _ and _ rxte _   observations",
    ". however , if such interpretation is correct , it is not clear how to compare this result with cygnus x1 , which has a much larger luminosity and almost the same spectral parameters @xcite .    mcclintock et al .",
    "( 2001b ) reported a break at about 2 kev in the @xmath204 spectrum of xte  j1118 + 480 , which was interpreted by esin et al .",
    "( 2001 ) as due to the presence of a warm absorber .",
    "the data used by mcclintock et al .",
    "( 2001b ) were obtained combining together different instruments aboard different missions .",
    "we do not see this break ( see figure 8) , that could also be due to cross  calibration problems .",
    "our main findings can be summarized as follows .",
    "we find the galactic column density of hi measured in radio in the direction to the source as @xmath205@xmath206 @xmath92 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) to be consistent with spectral fitting of our _ bepposax _ data ( see table 1 ) . on the other hand , we find the value of @xmath207 @xmath92 favored by dubus et al .",
    "( 2001 ) based on their measurement of ca absorption to be intrinsically highly uncertain (  [ nh ] ) as well inconsistent with our data (  [ results ] ) .",
    "our _ bepposax _ spectrum of xte  j1118 + 480 shows a power law with @xmath176 modified by a soft x - ray excess and a high energy cutoff , with both features highly significant statistically .",
    "the soft excess contains a small fraction of the total flux , and is consistent with a blackbody component , either undergoing comptonization or not .",
    "the high energy cutoff is well fitted by comptonization in a thermal plasma with an electron temperature of @xmath3 kev and a thomson optical depth of @xmath208 . in agreement with the weakness of the blackbody ,",
    "compton reflection is weak , also consistent with the weakness of an fe k@xmath11 line .",
    "the low amplitudes of all the features originating in the cold matter can have several explanations . if such components come from an underlying accretion disk , the relative large @xmath137 and inclination angle easily dim the observable reflection and blackbody features by a factor @xmath209 , consistent with our observations .",
    "however , in this case , the resulting compton spectrum would be steeper than observed .",
    "a possibility is that any cold matter subtends a small solid angle as seen by the hot gas . in this case",
    "the seed photons for comptonization can be provided by an outer cold disk , or by synchrotron emission internal in the hot disk , or both .",
    "if the geometry is that of a central hot disk , it is not clear if our data are consistent with the adaf solution , or instead if they rather indicate a radiative cooled hot accretion disk .",
    "the data are statistically consistent with the reflector to have a low metallicity , @xmath210 , as expected due to the high latitute of the system",
    ". this could be an important finding , which should be tested by future observations of the secondary .",
    "the values of @xmath129 and @xmath137 we find are very similar to those typical of most luminous ( e.g. , @xmath211 in cyg x-1 ) black - hole binaries in the hard state , whereas the x - ray luminosity in our measurement is only @xmath212 .",
