    "the steady decline in functional ability of an organism over time is known as senescence or aging .",
    "the phenomenon of aging is of obvious interest and has attracted attention from biologists and physicists for some time @xcite .",
    "the establishment and maintaintenance of harmful behaviour by natural selection would appear to defy explanation .",
    "medawar proposed @xcite that the strength of selection on survival related genes is dependent on the age at which the genes exert their effects . for genes that express themselves late in the life of an organism",
    "there is less impact on the dwindling population than for a gene whose effect is expressed earlier in life .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that favourable mutations that act to increase survivability can be used to account for senescence .",
    "such mutations will , under natural selection , increase the survivability at early ages converting an initially constant mortality rate into an age dependent one .",
    "it seems improbable that this mechanism can provide a full explanation of aging as positive mutations are so very rare compared to harmful ones .",
    "instead a better understanding can be gained by considering processes through which genes with harmful effects are introduced .",
    "there are two such theories : antagonistic pleiotropy and mutation accumulation @xcite .",
    "according to antagonistic pleitropy , senescence occurs as a result of mutations that increase the functional ability of the young and decrease that of the old .",
    "mutation accumulation proposes that aging occurs due to mutations that are initially harmless but take effect at later stages in the life of an organism . in either case",
    ", the force of natural selection is reduced once an organism ages beyond its point of reproductive maturity so the effects of either will be confined to older ages .",
    "the penna model is the most commonly used model of aging through mutation accumulation @xcite and is ideally suited to computational implementation .",

    "this work presents a solution to a generalized penna model , in particular one that allows incorporation of arbitrary survivability and birth functions .",
    "subtle modification to the survivability function has been found @xcite to demonstrate a mortality plateau at older ages , a result that had so far eluded theories of mutation accumulation .    to ensure that the population is in a steady state , the total population is controlled through the use of a verhulst factor @xcite .",

    "the bit string is traditionally @xmath6 bits long for ease of computational implementation .",
    "the finite - length bit string is an artifact of simulation and is discounted in our analysis where there is no need for such a restriction . along similar lines to almeida and thomas @xcite we consider a fixed probability of mutation occuring on any site .",
