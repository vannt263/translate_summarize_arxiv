    "one of the main features of many market and social processes is their bilateral structure and the need to match agents from one side of the market with the other side , e.g. students and schools in college admissions , employees and companies in the job market ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , men and women in online dating sites , advertisers and advertising slots in sponsored search ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a class of `` two - sided matching model '' for studying such problems was first introduced by gale and shapley in 1962 in their seminal paper @xcite , in the context of college admissions and the marriage problem .",
    "yet , the original model is quite general and can be easily adapted for other two - sided markets , such as the well - known national resident matching program ( nrmp ) for assigning medical students to residency positions in us .    in gale and shapley s seminal paper ,",
    "the college admissions problem is formulated as follows .",
    "let there be a set of colleges @xmath2 and a set of students @xmath3 .",
    "each college @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) has a quota @xmath6 , that denotes the maximum number of students it can admit .",
    "each student @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) can apply to any number of colleges , represented by a _",
    "strict _ preference ( ordering ) over the @xmath9 colleges .",
    "each college also has a strict ranking for all students ( e.g. according to their test scores , interview performances or other criteria ) .",
    "a _ matching _ is simply an assignment of students to colleges such that each college accepts no more students than its quota , and each student is admitted to at most one college . for convenience , we use @xmath10 to denote a dummy college that takes all unmatched students .",
    "the college admissions problem can then be stated as the problem of designing an algorithm to arrive at a matching satisfying certain properties .",
    "the _ mechanism _ that implements the solution can be considered as a blackbox that takes the students and colleges preferences ( denoted by @xmath11 ) as input , and outputs the matching , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ mechanism_prev ] .    in @xcite ,",
    "two desirable properties are defined : _ stability _ and _ optimality_. stability of a matching means that it is not possible to find a student and a college that are not matched to each other , but both prefer each other more than their current match . in college admissions , optimality means student - optimality .",
    "a stable matching is _ student - optimal _ if every student is at least as well - off as he / she is in any other stable matching .",
    "college - optimality can be defined in a similar way , but it is never used .",
    "gale and shapley proved that there always exists stable matchings .",
    "their proof is by construction ( using the deferred acceptance ( da ) algorithm in fig . [ mechanism_prev ] ) . in the special case when the colleges preferences are all based on student examination results ,",
    "the da algorithm is equivalent to a procedure that sorts all students according to merit and letting students choose the most preferred college ( if quota still allows ) in order , starting from the best student .",
    "it is also shown in @xcite that the optimal stable matching is unique .",
    "+    in practice , it is reportedly quite common that the boston mechanism ( bm ) ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is used instead .",
    "the basic procedures of bm are as follows : in the first round each college @xmath12 only considers students who listed it as their first choice and accepts these students one by one according to @xmath12 s own preference until the quota of the college is filled up . in the second round , only the remaining student without any offers and colleges still having unfilled quota are considered .",
    "each remaining college then considers students who listed it as the second choice and assigns offers to them one by one until the quota is exhausted .",
    "the process goes on round by round until all quota are filled up or all students are already accommodated .",
    "one major criticism concerning bm is its lack of stability",
    ". judged by classic matching theory , matching results under bm are far from stable and thus many students are `` incentivized '' to make complicated strategies when submitting their preference lists .",
    "in contrast , results under da are both stable and optimal for students .",
    "students can feel free to reveal their true preference lists .",
    "the transition from bm to da is therefore suggested in literature such as @xcite , which arguably would lead to significant efficiency gains for the whole community .",
    "however , our investigation of some practical college admissions systems shows that _ certain hybrid mechanism may be more acceptable in society from the perspective of colleges enrollment concerns as well as students personal interest_.    in this paper , we propose a generalized model for college admissions , which considers the tradeoff between students eligibility and interest by adjusting an additional parameter called _ reciprocating factor_. the larger the reciprocating factor is , the more would the interest factor counts when inspecting the applicants .",
    "bm and da are merely two special cases of the generalized model when setting different reciprocating factors .",
    "our model also extends the classic notion of stability and optimality by re - examining the formation of agents preferences .",
    "the remainder of the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : ca_hk ] we elaborate the actual college admissions system used in hong kong which inspires our formal model . in section [ sec : gene_model ] we proposes the generalized model for stable matching . some of the important properties of generalized model are presented and discussed extensively in section [ sec : property ] .",
    "section [ sec : simu ] compares the efficiency of generalized mechanism with the classic gale - shapley mechanism through simulation .",
    "we give some further discussion and related work in section [ sec : discussion ] and conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the joint university programmes admissions system ( jupas ) is the central system for students to apply to the nine participating tertiary institutions in hong kong @xcite . in jupas",
    "each student can apply to at most 25 programmes in order of preference .",
    "these preferences are sub - divided and made known to the institutions in the form of five bands as shown in table 1 .",
    ".correspondence between applicants band order and actual choice order [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the band order is made known to the programmes , however , the inner - band preferences are unrevealed . for example , in band a , the programme has no idea whether a student lists it as his / her first , second or third choice .",
    "after aggregating the preference lists from all the applicants , each programme will make a `` _ _ merit order list _ _ '' for its applicants in accordance with its criterion for selection .",
    "the rating criterion is determined independently by each programme : although many programmes would adopt a boston - like criterion which assigns band a students with highest priority , some programmes may also rate students only by their eligibility .",
    "some unpopular programmes tend to employ the latter strategy if they find most excellent students have listed it as band b or band c choices rather than band a.    finally , after all the _ _ merit order list__s and the applicants preference lists are sent to the jupas office , a central computer will automatically match the applicants with appropriate programmes .",
    "the matching process applies the classic _ student - proposing da algorithm _ to give the students the best offer he / she can possibly obtain .",
    "although the da algorithm is used in the last phase , the jupas mechanism as a whole is not equivalent to the classic _ gale - shapley student optimal mechanism _ in @xcite , where students would truthfully reveal their preference lists .",
    "applicants in jupas face a similar problem like students in bm : their band a choices would receive higher priority than choices in other bands , although there are no discrimination over the multiple inner - band choices . actually in jupas the applicants are always advised to choose appropriate programmes according to their interests as well as their qualifications @xcite .",
    "it is never a dominant strategy for students to always reveal their true preferences",
    ". therefore jupas may be interpreted as a hybrid of bm regarding inter - band discrimination and da regarding the algorithm applied in the final phase .",
    "the statement of `` gale - shapley student optimal stable mechanism is used in hong kong '' by @xcite is rather mis - informed and misleading : readers may falsely assume that applicants in hong kong could feel free to write down their true preferences , whereas in fact there is still room for students to manipulate their preference lists .",
    "a natural question is why not replace jupas with da as suggested in most literature . to answer it , we formulate a model in the next section in order to justify such selection of the policy makers for sticking with the hybrid mechanism",
    "we have mentioned in the previous section that programmes under jupas in hong kong have full right to determine how to rate students .",
    "two factors are the most important : student eligibility and band order . in practice ,",
    "most programmes put heavy weight on academic performance in determining students eligibility which makes the examination scores a very decisive factor in admission . to simplify the analysis , we assume each applicant would attend a standard examination and gain a total score which ranges from zero to the maximum mark . for band order , higher preference ( like band _ a _ )",
    "indicates that the applicant is more interested in the programme while ranking certain programme as band _ d _ or _ e _ infers the lack of interest .",
    "let @xmath13 denote the set of applicants , @xmath14 denote the set of programmes .",
    "each student @xmath15 achieves a total score @xmath16 $ ] in the standard examination where @xmath17 is the full mark of the examination .",
    "each programme @xmath18 has a quota @xmath19 .",
    "when student @xmath20 applies to programme @xmath12 as his / her @xmath21-th choice , @xmath20 will obtain a bonus score @xmath22 which would promote his / her position in programme @xmath12 s _ merit order list_. generally , the bonus score should be a strictly decreasing function over _ preference order / ranking _ @xmath21 .",
    "that is to say , the smaller @xmath21 is , the more bonus score it would bring . in practice , the programme director could make a corresponding table mapping each _ preference order _ to a certain bonus score for ease of reference .",
    "all applicants are then sorted by their _ merit scores _ in each programme , where student @xmath20 s _ merit score _ in programme @xmath12 is computed according to the following equation : @xmath23\\ ] ] the first term denotes the original score achieved by @xmath20 and the second term is the bonus score for students interest in @xmath12 . in case of tie when students share the same merit score , @xmath24 serves as the tie - breaker and student with higher @xmath24 obtains higher priority . finally ,",
    "if all terms are equal , we break the tie by a random lottery .",
    "we refer to @xmath25 as the _ reciprocating factor _ ( rf ) , a constant determined independently by each programme @xmath12 , reflecting its sensitivity towards applicant s _ preference order_. programmes with larger rf place more weight on applicants personal interests : other things being equal , students whose interests match with the programme are more favored . in the extreme case when @xmath26 of different programmes all equal to zero , the matching reduces to exactly the gale - shapley student optimal mechanism : preference order would not affect students positions in programmes ; in the contrary , when all @xmath26 are set to one , , there are actually an infinitely large amount of pairs @xmath25 and @xmath27 which can implement the boston mechanism , as long as it holds that for any @xmath12 and @xmath21 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we thank an anonymous referee for pointing this out . ]",
    "the matching works in the same way as the boston mechanism : the first choice gets the highest priority . for a general @xmath30 ,",
    "say @xmath25 equals to @xmath31 , it means that programme @xmath12 would count @xmath32 of original score and @xmath33 of interest factor when evaluating the applicants .",
    "after calculating the merit score for each applicant , each programme could generate a _ reciprocating preference _ list by comparing merits scores of the applicants .",
    "these reciprocating preferences are then sent to the central college admissions system for further processing .",
    "the complete procedures can be illustrated in fig .",
    "[ mechanism_ext ] where students _ reciprocating preferences _ remain the same as their original preferences @xmath34 .     +    the reciprocating factor we propose in this paper gives programmes more flexibility in choosing a `` reasonable '' enrollment mechanism :    * for programmes which hope to stick to the traditional boston - like scheme , there will be no need for any change since by default @xmath26 is set to one ; * for programmes whose sole objective is to raise the average score of newly admitted students , setting @xmath26 to zero would be their favorite strategy ; * for other elastic programmes concerning the students interest as well , a suitable @xmath26 between zero and one needs to be determined according to each programme s own admission policy in each admission year .",
    "in last section we proposed the notion of _ reciprocating preference _ which can better reflect the selection criteria of individual programmes .",
    "it it the student with higher merit score , rather than higher original exam score , that is more favored by each programme . with the change of the interpretation of agents preferences , important concepts such as stability and optimality",
    "should also need to be re - defined _ from the perspective of reciprocating preferences_. we now give the formal definition as follows .",
    "a matching is _ _ r - stable _ _ if it is not possible to find a student and a college that are not matched to each other , but both _ prefer _ each other more than their current match when judged by their _",
    "reciprocating preferences_.    a fundamental property of the generalized mechanism can be then presented as follows .",
    "[ theo : r_stable ] matching outcome under the generalized mechanism is _ r - stable_. moreover , it is _ optimal _ among all possible r - stable outcomes .",
    "the above theorem is easy to see by ignoring the preprocess phase in fig .",
    "[ mechanism_ext ] and focusing on the matching phase where da always generates stable and optimal matching given any preference lists .",
    "therefore from the perspective of reciprocating preferences , the matching outcome under jupas - like hybrid mechanism is still stable and optimal among all stable outcomes .",
    "since bm is merely an extreme case of the generalized mechanism , we may easily get the following corollary through property [ theo : r_stable ] .    the boston mechanism , known to be unstable by classic matching theory ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is actually r - stable with regard to colleges reciprocating preferences .    in previous analysis , we assume all students would submit their true preferences . however , this assumption is unrealistic , especially in practical college admissions system like jupas where strategic behaviors is actually quite common .",
    "we now show some key results for strategy analysis as follows .",
    "[ theo : no_truthful_mech ] college admissions mechanism like jupas is not strategy - proof in general .",
    "the exceptions are when all the programmes reciprocating factors are zero , it is the dominant strategy for students to reveal their true preferences .",
    "we defer the detailed proof to appendix [ proof : no_truthful_mech ] .",
    "when all programmes reciprocating factors are zero , the generalized model reduces to the classic gale - shapley student - optimal mechanism which is strategy - proof for students ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "generally , when most programmes have positive reciprocating factors , students would act strategically : students with relatively lower examination scores may try to avoid some popular programmes where there would be lots of competitors with higher scores , and list those unpopular ones as their top choices instead in order to obtain more bonus scores there and increase the chances for admission .",
    "it is worth pointing out that even though the generalized model is not strategy - proof , it does not imply that students would always have strong incentive to strategize . whether applicants strategies can work or not depends on how much information they know about other students behaviors .",
    "for example , suppose there are five students @xmath35 and @xmath36 gets the lowest exam score ; there are two programmes @xmath37 and @xmath38 , both with reciprocating factors @xmath39 and quota @xmath40 .",
    "if the preferences of students are strongly _ correlated _ , say all students consent that @xmath37 is better than @xmath38 , @xmath36 may try to avoid the popular programme @xmath37 and list @xmath38 as the first choice to get higher priority .",
    "otherwise , @xmath36 may end up with no offers at all .",
    "however , if students preferences are totally _ uncorrelated _ , which means different students hold independent views to the programmes , @xmath36 may know little about others preferences . in this scenario telling truth",
    "might be the best choice of students .",
    "the following property state this observation formally .",
    "[ theo : bayes_ne ] suppose all programmes have equal quota and their reciprocating factors are independently drawn from a uniform distribution over any range @xmath41 $ ] ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "besides , the preferences of all students are independently drawn from a uniform distribution over the set of all possible rank orderings ( i.e. , the uncorrelated environment ) .",
    "then , truth - telling is a bayesian nash equilibrium for each student under the generalized matching mechanism .    for readability",
    ", we defer the detailed proof to appendix [ proof : bayes_ne ] .    property [ theo : bayes_ne ]",
    "shows that students would be forced to reveal their true preferences if they have no exact knowledge of other students realized preferences except the distribution .",
    "this is one extreme case with totally uncorrelated preferences . at the other extreme",
    "is the totally correlated case where students have complete information of other students true preferences .",
    "property [ theo : dominated ] characterizes the possibilities of students strategies in the latter scenario .    [ theo : dominated ] suppose all students have the same preference over colleges . besides , this is a common knowledge among all students . let the quota of their favorite college be @xmath43 .",
    "then truth - telling is a _ dominated strategy _ for all students except the top @xmath43 students ranked according to their scores .",
    "we present the proof in appendix [ proof : dominated ] .    in practice",
    ", students can only have partial knowledge to other students submitted preferences , probably through the history of admission data in each individual programme .",
    "besides , students need to estimate the value of @xmath25 in each programme and carefully choose programmes they make strategy on since promoting preference in purpose for programmes which run da - like mechanism ( i.e. , @xmath26 is slightly above zero ) may have little effect in raising their merit scores in those programmes . on the other hand , in each admission year programmes would take lessons from admission outcomes of the previous year and adjust their policy on how to determine parameters like @xmath26 and @xmath44 .",
    "these interactions form a complicated extensive - form game which may be repeated infinitely at the time granularity of each admission year .",
    "this leaves a bunch of open questions to be settled such as : whether there are any equilibrium strategies and if they do exist , would the matching outcomes converge to any of these equilibrium states after finite rounds of games year by year .    until now we have focused on students strategies in submitting preferences and assumed that college programmes would reveal their reciprocating factors nonstrategically .",
    "while it seems intractable to characterize the dynamic game in the long run , we do obtain some analytical result for the single shot game in one particular admission year .",
    "the following property helps relieve our concerns of programmes strategies so that we may refocus on the manipulations from applicants side .",
    "[ theo : college_truth ] suppose after students submit their preferences , each college @xmath12 determines its true values of @xmath25 and @xmath22 independently .",
    "then revealing @xmath25 and @xmath22 truthfully would be the dominant strategy for any programme @xmath45 in the _ ex post _ perspective .",
    "we present the proof in appendix [ proof : college_truth ] .",
    "here we take the ex post perspective may not hold since colleges would take students reaction into consideration before making any decisions .",
    "it would be an interesting future work for analyzing the complicated interactions from the ex ante perspective . ] since when colleges make their strategies , students preferences are already submitted and fixed . in practice , when the admission authority evaluate the matching outcome each year , they can only conduct it based on the submitted preference lists of students",
    ". it would be expensive ( or even impossible ) to obtain the true preferences of all applicants via survey or other methods .",
    "thus for the single shot game , colleges would passively reveal their true parameters once they receive applicants preference lists .",
    "in this section we have shown some fundamental properties of the generalized mechanism . to further investigate the degree of satisfaction participants perceive under different mechanisms , we implement simulations and present the social welfare results different mechanisms induce in the next section .",
    "to define and compare social welfare under different matching outcomes , we need to quantify the utility of each participant / agent in the mechanism first .    denoted by @xmath46 the set of students and @xmath14 the set of colleges .",
    "@xmath47 is the set of all participants and @xmath48 is the set of all possible matching outcomes . for any agent @xmath49 ,",
    "let @xmath50 be the reciprocating preference list is students original preference .",

    "denote integer @xmath55 as the ranking agent @xmath56 appears in @xmath51 s preference list @xmath50 .",
    "for example , @xmath57 means that @xmath56 is the first choice in @xmath51 s preference list .",
    "we use @xmath58 to denote the unmatched case .",
    "we assume that agent @xmath51 s utility is additive and only determined by the orders of the matching set in the preference list , which can be written as , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is non - increasing as integer @xmath61 increases .",
    "intuitively , it means that higher order ( smaller @xmath21 ) would generate higher degree of satisfaction for agent @xmath51 .",
    "the aggregate utility of students ( or colleges ) under outcome @xmath62 is then : @xmath63    the _ social welfare _",
    "is defined as the aggregate utility of all participants in the mechanism , which can be written as follows : @xmath64    we say matching outcome @xmath65 is more _ efficient _ than @xmath66 if : @xmath67    we further say mechanism @xmath68 is more _ efficient _ than @xmath69 if @xmath70 can always induce a more efficient matching outcome than @xmath69 under any possible preference lists of agents . generally speaking",
    ", an outcome would be more efficient if it induces higher ranked matching . in the context of college admissions ,",
    "a mechanism which generates more first - choice matching for students is likely to be more efficient .",
    "suppose there are @xmath71 students and @xmath72 colleges with just one quota in each college .",
    "we assume the utility of each agent is as follows , @xmath73 thus a first - ranked matching would bring in utility of @xmath71 for either students or colleges .",
    "notice that the efficiency upper bound is @xmath74 since there are at most five pairs of students and colleges matched with each other .",

    "consider the situation when a woman faces two men proposals and has no clear idea which one she strictly prefers .",
    "technically , we call there exists a _ tie _ in the woman s preference list . roughly speaking , the existing literature mainly provides two solutions to deal with marriage problem with tie .",
    "a quick solution is just requiring the woman to flip a coin to produce a strict preference list so that the previous mechanism could be applied immediately .",
    "the other solution concerns how to find the optimal matching outcome among all these artificial tie - breaking possibilities , for instance , the polynomial - time stable improvement cycles algorithm raised in @xcite .",

    "a new choice - augmented deferred acceptance ( cada ) mechanism was proposed accordingly which supports a greater scope of efficiency than the pure gs mechanism ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the same authors further generalized the single example into a `` baseline model '' where students have common ordinal preferences and schools have no priorities in @xcite . besides , @xcite showed that the above analytical results could extend to more realistic cases such as weak priorities by simulation .",
    "featherstone and niederle then classified the efficiency issue in sc into three categories ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) :    ex post : : :    each student knows preferences of other students and lottery results    in each school . the matching outcome as well as the efficiency are    both deterministic .",
    "interim : : :    students know preferences of other students but remain unknown to the    lottery results , i.e. , we would investigate the efficiency before the    lotteries are drawn .",
    "the distribution of lottery results would induce    an expected , other than deterministic , value of efficiency .",
    "ex ante : : :    students only know the distribution of other students preferences and    still remain ignorant of lottery results .",
    "the authors concluded in the same paper that , when student preferences are uniformly distributed and schools are completely symmetric , the boston mechanism can first - order stochastically dominate the gs mechanism in terms of _ ex ante _ efficiency , both in theory and in the laboratory .",
    "following the efficiency classification above , results in @xcite would all fall into the _ interim _ viewpoint with highly _ correlated _ student preferences , which complements the conclusion in @xcite under _ independent _ student preferences .",
    "although sharing the same caution against a hasty replacement of the boston mechanism , our paper stands distinct from these above works in several aspects :    * one _ key _",
    "assumption for the above works is the _ weak _ or even no priorities in schools such that lotteries are largely relied upon in schools in order to break the tie .",
    "it is this `` randomness '' that causes the potential _ ex ante _ efficiency loss of the gs mechanism .",
    "however , in practical ca context where students scores rather than the random lotteries play the decisive role in admissions , the above assumption would no longer hold , so would the corresponding conclusions . *",
    "our paper follows a distinctive and unique research direction and shows that even when the priorities in schools are _ strict _ , boston still exhibits some prominent properties such as respecting the interests of applicants .",
    "the sociological consideration of agents preferences has been largely ignored in previous research of college admissions system .    in terms of interdependent preferences ,",
    "we notice a recent work of @xcite proposing `` interdependent values '' in two - sided matching which can be regarded as a complementary notion to our reciprocating preferences . in @xcite",

    "in this paper we propose a generalized matching mechanism which can incorporate both bm and da . inspired by a practical college admissions system ,",
    "i.e. , jupas in hong kong , we propose a common parameter , namely _ reciprocating factor _ ( or @xmath26 ) , for the generalized matching model .",
    "this parameter serves as a bridge between bm and da : when all @xmath26 are set to zero , the matching mechanism would be equivalent to pure bm ; when all @xmath26 equal to one , the matching mechanism reduces to pure da . practical systems like jupas can be regarded as a hybrid of bm and da with reciprocating factor between zero and one . in the context of college admissions ,",
    "reciprocating factor is of practical significance for programmes to achieve the tradeoff between eligibility and real interest of enrolled students .",
    "we have discussed the advantage and disadvantage of da and the generalized mechanism extensively and highlighted the debate from the perspective of colleges side . these potential concerns and doubts from colleges would help justify the current selection of hybrid system in hong kong .    with regard to future works ,",

    "one major open question regarding the generalized mechanism is how history data of admission may affect the strategies and choices of current applicants . are there any equilibria for this extensive - form game that all participants would conform to ?",
    "how would their behaviors in the system evolve in the long run ?",
    "we hope that these strategic issues can be tackled in the future .",
    "2 .   how the reciprocating factors of colleges are distributed is another interesting direction which we have not yet investigated in details .",
    "@xcite showed that both popular and unpopular colleges have motives of giving preferential treatment to applicants who rank them as top choices .",
    "does this imply that different colleges tend to have similar reciprocating factors in practice ?",
    "this question may not be addressed immediately since these `` inside '' information of colleges is typically inaccessible to the public .",
    "we have showed some positive results of the hybrid system through simulation , however , simulation alone is insufficient to cover all complicated strategies of students . as the future work , we plan to design some lab experiments which would involve real participants to play and learn during the game .",
    "we believe that these empirical results would provide more evidence and insight for supporting and spreading the adoption of hybrid system like jupas in hong kong .",

    "<S> in considering the college admissions problem , almost fifty years ago , gale and shapley came up with a simple abstraction based on preferences of students and colleges . </S>",
    "<S> they introduced the concept of stability and optimality ; and proposed the _ deferred acceptance _ ( da ) algorithm that is proven to lead to a stable and optimal solution . </S>",
    "<S> this algorithm is simple and computationally efficient . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in subsequent studies it is shown that the da algorithm is also strategy - proof , which means , when the algorithm is played out as a mechanism for matching two sides ( e.g. colleges and students ) , the parties ( colleges or students ) have no incentives to act other than according to their true preferences . yet , in practical college admission systems , the da algorithm is often not adopted . instead , an algorithm known as the _ boston mechanism _ ( bm ) or its variants are widely adopted . in bm </S>",
    "<S> , colleges accept students without deferral ( considering other colleges decisions ) , which is exactly the opposite of gale - shapley s da algorithm . to explain and rationalize this reality , </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the notion of _ reciprocating preference _ to capture the influence of a student s interest on a college s decision . </S>",
    "<S> this model is inspired by the actual mechanism used to match students to universities in hong kong . </S>",
    "<S> the notion of reciprocating preference defines a class of matching algorithms , allowing different degrees of reciprocating preferences by the students and colleges . </S>",
    "<S> da and bm are but two extreme cases ( with zero and a hundred percent reciprocation ) of this set . </S>",
    "<S> this model extends the notion of stability and optimality as well . as in gale - shapley s original paper </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss how the analogy can be carried over to the stable marriage problem , thus demonstrating the model s general applicability . * * jel classification**@xmath0c78 </S>",
