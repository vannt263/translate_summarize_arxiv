    "the chiral symmetry spontaneously breaking ( cssb ) is an important feature in the theory of qcd , which governs the dynamics of hadrons at very low energies .",
    "it is generally believed that there is an energy scale @xmath3gev , below which the chiral symmetry @xmath4 is spontaneously breaking to @xmath5 associated with eight goldstone bosons@xcite . under this strong symmetry constraint , effective lagrangian of mesons , @xmath6 ,",
    "can be constructed with numbers of parameters@xcite .",
    "this is the base of the chiral perturbation theory ( chpt)@xcite , and hence chpt can be thought of as a rigorous qcd theory . as the typical energy scale @xmath7 for corresponding hadron dynamics",
    "is much less than @xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath9 , it serves as a good approximation to take a few leading- and next to the leading terms in @xmath10 in @xmath11(or in momentum , or in derivative ) expansion .",
    "thus , the chpt calculations become to be practicable . usually , in practice , the calculations in chpt are up to @xmath12 .",
    "the predictions of such @xmath12-calculations describe pseudoscalar meson physics at very low energies quite well .",
    "however , as the energies go up to the meson resonance region ( say @xmath13 ) , two novel ingredients should be taken into account : 1 , the meson resonances will be excited and they should emerge in the theory ; 2 , since the energies go up , the @xmath14 will be not much less than @xmath15 . for @xmath0-decays , @xmath16gev and @xmath17 ; for @xmath1 , @xmath18gev and @xmath19 ; for @xmath2 , @xmath20gev and @xmath21 .",
    "in these cases , the calculations based on taking only a few leading terms in @xmath11expansion ( i.e. , so called @xmath22 calculations ) will no longer be legitimate . in order to investigate the vector meson decays , all terms of the @xmath11expansions should be taken into account , and then be summed over .",
    "we will call it resummation studies on the corresponding vector meson processes . obviously , for vector meson resonance physics at low energies , such resummation studies are necessary and meaningful even though it may be a heavy work . if such studies based on chiral expansion can be performed and the results are reasonable well",
    ", then one can conclude that the chiral dynamics ( or chiral effective lagrangian theory ) works up to this vector meson energy scale . if not , we will have no reason to think so .",
    "another motive in this paper is to explore the cssb of qcd in a non - trivial and realistic qcd - inspired model .",
    "cssb is a prior hypothesis in chpt .",
    "hence , the success of chpt provides an indirect evidence for existence of cssb in qcd .",
    "the mechanism of cssb has been widely discussed in the literature@xcite@xcite . however , that how to prove it and how to derive and then to determine the critical energy scale @xmath8 from the fundamental qcd theory still remain to be settled@xcite .",
    "therefore , it is still interesting and meaningful to study this subject in more realistic models and in new non - perturbative methods .",
    "cssb in qcd could be thought of as a kind of quantum phase transition phenomenon in the quantum field theories , which is caused by quantum fluctuations in the system@xcite .",
    "it is well known that as @xmath7 below @xmath8 ( or after cssb ) , the quantum dynamical freedoms are meson fields and the dynamics is described in chiral effective meson lagrangian .",
    "the @xmath23-matrices of this lagrangian field theory have to be unitary , which belongs to the first principle requirement in quantum theories . thus ,",
    "as one had a chiral effective meson lagrangian with all order - terms in @xmath7- ( or space - time derivative- ) expansions , the following question can be asked : in what range of @xmath24 the @xmath23-matrices yielded by the feynman rules of the theory are unitary ?",
    "the answer will lead to the determination of @xmath8 because the upper - limit of this @xmath7-range should just be @xmath8 .",
    "in other words , as above this @xmath7-upper - limit , i.e. , @xmath25 , the quantum field description of this chiral effective meson lagrangian system will collapse .",
    "this is precisely a critical phenomenon . in conception of heisenberg",
    "s uncertainty principle , the quantum fluctuations of the system in the coordinate space are arisen from its momentum @xmath7 : larger distance physics associating with relatively smaller quantum fluctuations corresponds to smaller @xmath7 , and smaller distance one with larger fluctuations corresponds to larger @xmath7 .",
    "thus , for a quantum field system , it may transfer from order phase to disorder phase along with @xmath7-increasing , and then the critical energy scale emerges in the description of the dynamics .",
    "it is meaningful and interesting to reveal this scale by applying non - perturbation method to a quantum field system and by examining the unitarity of the theory . in this paper",
    "we shall try to realize this idea , i.e. , we shall use the resummation derivation method to explore the unitarity of the chiral constituent quark model with vector mesons ( see below ) , and then to determine the critical scale @xmath8 .    in the literature ,",
    "there are several schemes to extend the chiral symmetry considerations to be including vector meson resonances , and then the corresponding chpt - like effective theories with @xmath26 and @xmath27 mesons can be constructed and studied@xcite@xcite . because there are huge number of unknown - parameters in high order terms of @xmath11expansion in this kind of theories ,",
    "it is impracticable to perform resummation studies in the formalism of chpt - like theories with vector mesons .",
    "actually , most of all calculations in the literature in these chpt - like theories are limited to be of @xmath12 or @xmath28 and to be of the leading order of @xmath29-expansion @xcite .",
    "this situation , of course , is not satisfactory for the studies of vector meson physics even though the theories seem to be model - independent . in this paper",
    "we try to provide a phenomenon study based on systemical resummation calculations to processes of @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 in a realistic qcd - inspired model .    as a qcd - inspired model , the chiral quark model ( chqm ) ( or numbu - jona - lasinio version models and its extensions )",
    "has been extensively studied in hadron physics@xcite .",
    "the starting point of the model is a chiral constituent quark lagrangian with dynamical goldstone bosons@xcite .",
    "the spin-1 mesons are included into the model by using the wccwz realization@xcite . in refs.@xcite ,",
    "two of us have investigated this model in @xmath7-resummation manner for @xmath0-decays . in this paper",
    "we shall recapture the resummation studies in refs.@xcite and make it more precise , and then extend it to @xmath1- , @xmath2-decay processes .",
    "furthermore , we propose a new method to determine the @xmath8 . we shall use large-@xmath35 expansion and optic theorem to prove a necessary condition for the unitarity of the theory , which has to be satisfied by meson s transition amplitudes .",
    "then we use the feynman rules to calculate the transition amplitudes of vector meson decays , and compare the results with the requirement of the necessary condition of the unitarity , and then the @xmath25 is determined .",
    "this determination is regularization scheme free .",
    "specifically , the follows will be shown in this paper : 1 , in order to perform the @xmath7-resummation derivation to the effective meson lagrangian described vector meson decays , a method called as proper vertex expansion@xcite ( rather than the schwenger proper time method@xcite ) is used to calculate the quark loop contributions to it .",
    "it is shown that the power series of momentum expansion for the vector meson decay amplitudes converge slowly .",
    "this fact indicates that the @xmath7-resummations are necessary indeed for the vector meson decays ; 2 , since both constituent quarks and the goldstone bosons are dynamical freedom fields in the chqm , in the calculations for getting the effective meson lagrangian at one loop level both contributions due to the quark loop and ones due to the goldstone boson loop have to be taken into account .",
    "considering the contributions of quark loops and ones of goldstone boson loops are of @xmath36 and @xmath37 in @xmath29-expansion respectively , consequently , any consistent loop - expansion calculations in the chqm must include the contributions from the next to leading order in @xmath29-expansion in the model . in this paper",
    ", we shall calculate both quark loops and goldstone boson loops for @xmath38 ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 are vector- and pseudoscalar mesons respectively ) in chqm .",
    "the analytical calculations to the corrections of the next to the leading order of @xmath41-expansion are somehow heavy , but it is necessary ; 3,the parameters in the effective meson lagrangian derived from the above procedure can been fixed by meeting the requirements of ksrf sum rule@xcite , zweig rule forbidden to @xmath42 , beta decay of neutron and by matching the low energy limit of this theory with the constraints of chpt ; 4 , the low energy limit of the effective meson field theory of chqm is checked and it is shown that the results are consistent with chpt , and hence chqm is of a legitimate qcd - inspired model at very low energies ( see appendix a ) ; 5 , the decay widths for @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are calculated in this parameter - free theory and the predictions are compared with data ; 6 , based on the results of the resummation studies , we derive the @xmath46 and it is found out that @xmath46 is flavor - dependent .",
    "the contents of this paper are organized as following : in section ii we introduce the model with giving the notations ; section iii is devoted to illustrate the proper vertex expansion ; in section iv , the kinetic terms of vector mesons are derived ; section v , the quark loop contributions to vector meson decays ; section vi , the goldstone boson loop contributions to vector meson decays ; section vii , the numerical results ; section viii , unitarity and large @xmath35 expansion . a necessary condition for the unitarity of the meson theory deduced from chqm",
    "is revealed in this section ; section ix , determination of @xmath8 : i.e. , applying the necessary condition of the unitarity , the upper limit of @xmath7 is derived , and then @xmath8 is determined .",
    "finally , we provide a brief summary and discussion . in the appendices , we provide derivations of the low - energy limit of the theory , and",
    "show how to perform parametrization of the quadratic divergence emerged in the meson loop calculations in the text .",

    "there is only one parameter in this simple model , i.e. , constituent quark mass @xmath71 . with appropriate choice of @xmath71-value , the coefficients in chpt , @xmath72 ,",
    "have been derived in refs@xcite .",
    "the results shown that the simple - chqm is consistent with chpt .",
    "therefore , it is substantial to take the formulation of chqm as our stating point .    for our purposes , the simple - chqm must be extended to include lowest vector meson resonances and go beyond the chiral limit .",
    "the mass difference of constituent quarks with different flavors is assumed to be caused by current quark masses . the light quark mass matrix @xmath73 is usually included in external spin-0 fields , i.e. , @xmath74 , where @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath7 are scalar and pseudoscalar external fields respectively .",
    "the chiral transformation for @xmath77 is @xmath78 .",
    "thus @xmath77 and @xmath79 together with @xmath60 and @xmath80 can form su(3)@xmath68 invariant quantities @xmath81 which are scalar and pseudoscalar respectively . then",

    "it means that the symmetry and some underlying constrains of qcd can not fix the couplings between pseudoscalar mesons and constituent quarks .",
    "hence @xmath85 is treated as an initial parameter of the model and will be fitted phenomenologically .    from the viewpoint of chiral symmetry only ,",
    "an alternative scheme for incorporating vector mesons was suggested by weinberg @xcite and developed by callan , coleman et al @xcite . in this treatment , vector meson resonances @xmath86 transform homogeneously under su(3)@xmath68 , @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "then the simple - chqm is extended to a chiral quark model including both pseudoscalar mesons and the lowest meson resonances , which will be called chqm simply hereafter .",

    "in chiral quark model , low energy effective action of light hadrons is generated through loop effects of constituent quarks .",

    "actually , it is impracticable . instead of it , we shall derive the effective action by computing the loop effects of constituent quarks directly . in this way , the calculations are expansions of loops , or of proper vertices of external fields rather than momentum expansions .",
    "we call this method as proper vertex expansion following refs.@xcite , in which all terms in @xmath7-expansion are catched for concrete processes , and hence the corresponding calculations are of resummation of @xmath7-expansion .    the quark part of lagrangian  ( [ 2.12 ] )",

    "in addition , when we calculate two - point diagram ( fig.3(b)(e ) ) , we must include all chain - like diagrams of pseudoscalar meson loops which have imaginary part ( fig.3(c)(f ) ) , e.g. , @xmath210 loop for @xmath0 decay . because it will generates a large imaginary part of @xmath23-matrix for vector mesons physics .",
    "when calculating tadpole , we need various quark one - loop diagrams with various external vertices but with one vector meson external source and four pseudoscalar meson external sources .",
