    "some recent simulations of structure formation in cdm universes have suggested that dark matter halos generally form with a `` universal '' density profile , in which @xmath5 ( navarro , frenk , & white 1997 , hereafter nfw ) .",
    "however , this claim has been questioned by other numerical work ( e.g. , anninos & norman 1996 ; kravtsov et al .",
    "1998 ) ; in particular , moore et al .  ( 1998 ) find instead that @xmath6 as @xmath7 in a set of highly resolved n - body halos .",
    "the little _ observational _ evidence that has been brought to bear on this issue is also ambiguous ; e.g. , the basic form of the nfw halo appears to apply in cnoc clusters of galaxies ( carlberg et al .",
    "1997 ) , but not in the dwarf galaxy ddo154 ( burkert & silk 1997 ) .",
    "letter _ tests the viability of the proposed universal halo , among other models for the dark matter distribution , in the nearby virgo cluster ( @xmath8 mpc ; pierce et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "the x - ray emission from virgo , which is centered on the cd galaxy m87 , has been used many times to constrain mass models for the cluster core ( nulsen & bhringer 1995 , and references therein ) . here , an attempt is made to supplement this standard analysis with larger - scale constraints on @xmath9 from the spatial distribution and dynamics of the galaxies in virgo .",
    "to do so , the infalling late - type galaxies that are responsible for much of the cluster s irregular optical structure are excluded from analysis . instead",
    ", reference will be made only to the _ early _ hubble types in virgo , which are spatially concentrated ( about a point @xmath10 nw of m87 ) with a roughly gaussian velocity distribution ( centered near the velocity of m87 ) , and which therefore suggest the existence of a relatively smooth and relaxed underlying mass distribution ( see binggeli , tammann , & sandage 1987 ) . in",
    "what follows , this is essentially adopted as a postulate .",
    "it is further assumed that virgo is spherically symmetric and centered on m87 .",
    "this is a reasonable first - order characterization of the x - ray structure around the galaxy , and will serve as a coarse - average approximation to the overall cluster structure . as part of this , the apparent offset between m87 and the centroid of the early - type galaxy isopleths is taken _ not _ to reflect a large perturbation in the fundamental mass distribution , and is ignored .",
    "while imperfect , these simplifications ultimately admit a model for virgo that is of interest both for its basic structure  the central scaling @xmath11 of nfw is indicated , and is favored clearly over the steeper cusps of either moore et al .",
    "( 1998 ) or a singular isothermal sphere  and for the relations it suggests between the galaxies , gas , and dark matter in this cluster .",
    "a significant contribution to the total mass on the smallest spatial scales in virgo comes from the stars in m87 itself . with",
    "the _ stellar _ ( core ) mass - to - light ratio of this galaxy known ( van der marel 1991 ) , and taken to be independent of radius , the mass density profile @xmath12 follows from the @xmath13-band surface photometry of de vaucouleurs & nieto ( 1978 ) , which extends to @xmath14 kpc .",

    "( 1994 ) yields the profile defined in table [ tab1 ] ( for @xmath8 mpc , and with @xmath18 mag of extinction [ burstein & heiles 1984 ] taken into account ) .",
    "note that this model closely approximates a standard @xmath19 law in projection ( see dehnen 1993 ) .    moving outwards , density and temperature profiles for the hot gas within @xmath20 kpc of m87",
    "have been obtained from _ rosat _",
    "pspc observations by nulsen & bhringer ( 1995 , hereafter nb95 ) .",
    "their analysis assumes homogeneity , or a single - phase medium , which could be a potential source of error _ if _ a cooling flow has produced a multiphase gas in virgo ; however , this possibility appears to be of concern only at radii near the low end of the range in the _ rosat _ data ( viz .",
    "@xmath21 kpc : canizares et al .",
    "1982 ; tsai 1994 ) .",
    "thus , use is made here of the _ model - independent _ gravitating mass profile , @xmath22 , which nb95 derive by applying the standard assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium to their @xmath23 and @xmath24 measurements .",
    "still further out , the ( azimuthally averaged ) surface density of dwarf ellipticals in virgo is given by binggeli et al .",
    "( 1987 ) , who find @xmath25^{-1}$ ] for @xmath26 .",
    "( the distribution of e / s0 systems , though somewhat more irregular in detail , is also consistent with this average profile . )",
    "the offset between the x - ray and optical centroids of virgo is small enough  about half a core radius , and not much larger than m87 itself  that the same @xmath27 applies to galaxy counts taken in rings centered on either point .",
    "binggeli et al.s parametrization then implies a three - dimensional @xmath28^{-3/2}$ ] .",
    "the galaxy data _ do not require _ this constant - density core , however ; they are equally well fit by projections of either a hernquist ( 1990 ) profile , @xmath29 , or an nfw profile , @xmath30 ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] below ) .    finally , girardi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) use the velocities of 180 early - type virgo galaxies to measure the _ aperture _ velocity dispersion , @xmath31the r.m.s .",
    "line - of - sight velocity for all objects within a given distance from m87as a function of @xmath16 from @xmath32 kpc to 2 mpc .",
    "essentially the same @xmath33 profile is obtained with circular apertures taken about the optical center of virgo instead ( cf .  fadda et al .",
    "1996 ) .    given these data , a parametric model for the dark matter halo may be specified as @xmath34 , with @xmath35 a dimensionless form function .",
    "it is then convenient to refer the halo s normalization and scale to the observed stellar quantities in m87 ( table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "thus , with @xmath36 and @xmath37 , the mass interior to any radius is @xmath38\\ , \\label{eq:2}\\ ] ] in which @xmath39 and @xmath40 are fixed by fitting to the observed mass profile at @xmath41 kpc .",
    "if a good fit is achieved , no free parameters are left in the model , and it remains only to check its extrapolation to larger radii against the dynamics of the early - type galaxies . to this end , the observed @xmath42 ( from any of the functional fits mentioned above ) and the model @xmath43 are used to solve the spherical jeans equation for the radial velocity dispersion of the galaxies : @xmath44 @xmath45\\ , \\label{eq:3}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the usual measure of orbital anisotropy .",
    "the dispersion along any single line of sight then follows from the projection @xmath47 with @xmath48 .",
    "finally , @xmath49 is compared with the observed aperture velocity dispersion profile at @xmath50 kpc .",
    "if this comparison is unsatisfactory , but the basic assumption of dynamical equilibrium is retained , then the underlying form of @xmath51 may be rejected .",
    "a potential complication is that the orbital anisotropy of the galaxies is not known a priori , and a given @xmath52 can safely be discarded only if it can not reproduce the empirical @xmath33 for _ any _ assumed @xmath53 .",
    "fortunately , the virgo data prove to be quite consistent with a simple @xmath54 , i.e. , isotropic orbits .",
    "the field of possible halo profiles can be narrowed somewhat by first requiring consistency with a small subset of the data : from nb95 and girardi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , @xmath55 where all uncertainties are @xmath56-@xmath57 limits .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] illustrates tests of four different form functions against these three constraints only : in panel ( a ) , @xmath58^{-1}$ ] ( an isothermal sphere with a core ; cf .",
    "nb95 ) ; in ( b ) , @xmath59 ; in panel ( c ) , @xmath60 ( the model of nfw ) ; and in ( d ) , @xmath61 ( as in the n - body simulations of moore et al .  1998 ) . the different line types in each panel contain combinations of @xmath39 and @xmath40 that are consistent ( for @xmath54 ) with the 2-@xmath57 limits on the _ individual _ data points in equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) ; the various dots identify models which yield the best estimates for both members of different data _ pairs_. a minimally self - consistent model for @xmath62 must draw its normalization and scale length from the intersection of the three bands in the appropriate panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , and ideally the three dots should coincide at a unique @xmath63 .",
    "panel ( d ) of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows that a central cusp as steep as @xmath64 ( moore et al .",
    "1998 ) can not easily account for the observed @xmath65 inside both 30 kpc and 150 kpc : the implied @xmath66 at small @xmath15 is _ shallower _ than what is inferred from the observed excess of @xmath22 over the stellar @xmath67 .",
    "this is even more of a problem for the singular isothermal sphere ( @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) , which is altogether inconsistent with the x - ray masses ( see also nb95 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the mass constraints at @xmath41 kpc are satisfied by any of the halos with central @xmath11 or shallower ; but the weak cusps in panels ( a ) and ( b ) give the best agreement for scale radii @xmath70 that are so small [ to limit a _ steeply _ rising @xmath71 as to imply total halo masses which are too low to support the velocity dispersion of the virgo galaxies on large spatial scales .",
    "thus , the `` universal '' halo of nfw , with its central @xmath11 and with @xmath54 , emerges as the best candidate for a self - consistent description of the virgo cluster [ panel ( c ) ] .",
    "this simple analysis is limited in two respects .",
    "( 1 ) at very small @xmath7215 kpc , where @xmath73 , the halo could depart from @xmath11 and not conflict with any observations . and ( 2 ) little can be said about the behavior of @xmath62 in the limit @xmath74 ; for example , the same procedure that leads to fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows that the profile of hernquist ( 1990 ) , @xmath75 ( as suggested by the early simulations of dubinski & carlberg 1991 ) , is just as acceptable as the nfw @xmath76 in virgo .",
    "the best fits of these two models have different _ parameters _ ( given in table [ tab1 ] ) , but show no real _ physical _ differences on @xmath77 mpc scales .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] compares the full sets of data discussed in  2 with models using the best - fit nfw and hernquist halos .",
    "the top panel shows the best x - ray estimate and 95% confidence limits for @xmath22 ( dashed line and bold curves ) , along with results from optical spectroscopy of the stars in m87 ( sargent et al .",
    "1978 ; filled triangles ) and from radial velocities of its globular clusters ( cohen & ryzhov 1997 ; open triangles ) .",
    "these latter sets of data independently corroborate the models .",
    "( the globular cluster dynamics specifically will be discussed in a future paper . ) the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] then compares the surface density profile of early - type galaxies with that of each fit to the dark matter halo .",
    "this shows ",
    "the analysis _ did not assume_that @xmath78 in virgo .",
    "this fact is used to compute aperture dispersion profiles that , for @xmath54 , show excellent agreement with the data in the bottom of fig .",
    "it also allows the uncertainties on @xmath40 in table [ tab1 ] to be estimated by fitting the projection of @xmath9 to @xmath27 ; the limits on @xmath39 then follow from plots like panel ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    in either of these models , the virial radius of the dark matter halo ",
    "roughly , that within which its mean density is 200 times the critical density for closure  is @xmath79 mpc ( for @xmath80 km s@xmath81 mpc@xmath81 ) , corresponding to a mass of @xmath82 .",
    "this emphasizes that the dark matter ( and the gas ) around m87 is associated  by construction  with the whole of virgo ; and this weakens previous arguments ( binggeli et al .",
    "1987 ) which suggested that the cluster could not be relaxed .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows that the hot gas within 200 kpc of m87 directly traces the distribution of dark matter ( and galaxies ) in virgo : @xmath83 . if this is assumed to hold throughout the entire cluster , then the similarity of its total stellar and gas masses ( arnaud et al .",
    "1992 ) implies a global baryon fraction of @xmath84 , roughly in line with other low - temperature clusters ( arnaud & evrard 1998 ) . the bottom of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] also shows a close agreement between the observed gas temperatures and the virial temperature , @xmath85 , of the dark matter halo .",
    "thus , simple virialization of gas that traces the dark matter in an @xmath3 halo suffices to explain the density and temperature structure of the intracluster medium at the center of virgo .",
    "this suggests  if an nfw - type halo truly is universal , and if the proportionality @xmath86 is typical  that central density cusps and temperature drops in the gas of x - ray clusters _ may not , by themselves , prove the existence of cooling flows_. that said , however , radiative cooling times are unequivocally short in the core of virgo @xmath87 yr for @xmath88 kpc ) ; and it remains to be seen whether a single - phase gas virialized in an nfw halo can account for the low - energy x - ray line fluxes observed there , or if these still require mass drop - out and the development of a multiphase medium at small radii in a cooling flow ( cf .",
    "tsai 1994 ) .",
    "of course , virgo by itself can not establish the `` universality '' of a central @xmath11 structure , even among only cluster - sized halos .",
    "it is worth noting , then , that clusters at @xmath89 in the cnoc survey are also well fit by an nfw model for the dark matter ( carlberg et al .  1997 ) .",
    "moreover , the nfw concentration of virgo , @xmath90 , is consistent with that of the cnoc clusters .",
    "this @xmath91 seems low , however , by comparison with @xmath92-cdm simulations of halo evolution ( nfw ; thomas et al .",
    "the physical origin of this discrepancy  and , for that matter , of the @xmath3 cusp itself  is unclear .",
