    "the be / x - ray binary systems represent the largest sub - class of all high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxb ) .",
    "a survey of the literature reveals that of the @xmath3240 hmxbs known in our galaxy and the magellanic clouds @xcite , @xmath450% fall within this class of binary .",
    "in fact , in recent years a substantial population of hmxbs has emerged in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , comparable in number to the galactic population , though unlike the galactic population , all except one of the smc hmxbs are be star systems . in these systems",
    "the orbit of the be star and the compact object , presumably a neutron star , is generally wide and eccentric .",
    "x - ray outbursts are normally associated with the passage of the neutron star close to the circumstellar disk @xcite and generally are classified as types i or ii @xcite ) .",
    "the type i outbursts occur periodically at the time of the periastron passage of the neutron star , whereas type ii outbursts are much more extensive and occur when the circumstellar material expands to fill most , or all of the orbit .",
    "general reviews of such hmxb systems may be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite    in this paper we present the analysis of x - ray and optical data from the recently discovered transient system swift j0513.4 - 6547 in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "the source was initially detected by the _",
    "swift _ observatory and a pulse period of 27.2s identified @xcite . following the convention established by @xcite of naming pulsating x - ray binary systems in the magellanic cloud by their pulse period",
    "we will refer to this source as lxp 27.2 throughout this work .",
    "@xcite associated the x - ray source with the source 2mass 05132826 - 6547187 .",
    "this counterpart was subsequently identified as the r@xmath315.5 star 59.5431.442 in the macho database , but no optical period was detected in those data @xcite .",
    "detailed follow - up observations by the grond optical telescope @xcite established the optical - ir magnitudes of the counterpart and suggested that there was evidence for an optical / nir brightening over previous archival measurements .",
    "such a brightening is often associated with an x - ray outburst from a be / x - ray binary system .",
    "@xcite subsequently reported the detection of the same pulse period in data from the _ fermi / gbm _ telescope over many days .",
    "the _ swift / xrt _ telescope detected lxp 27.2 on several occasions and those data can be used to established the best position of the x - ray source as ra(j2000 ) = @xmath5 , dec(j2000 ) = @xmath6 , with an estimated uncertainty of 1.9 arcsec radius @xcite .",
    "this position is consistent with that of a v@xmath315 star identifiable in several existing catalogues .",
    "figure  [ fig : fti ] shows an _ i_-band image of lxp 27.2 .",
    "the source was re - detected by _ xmm - newton _ and _ swift _ in aug and sep 2014 respectively , both occasions falling close to the time of optical maximum and hence the outbursts were proposed to be evidence of on - going type i outbursts from this system @xcite .",
    "optical data from the optical gravitational lensing experiment phase iv ( ogle ; @xcite ) were used to investigate the long - term behaviour of the optical counterpart in the lxp 27.2 system .",
    "the source is identified as lmc 506.16.16 within the ogle iv phase of the project .",
    "shown in figure  [ fig : all_ogle ] are the ogle iv data covering 4.5 years ( mjd 55260 - 56710 ) - this period starts after the discovery x - ray outburst ( mjd 54890 - 54950 ) .",
    "it is immediately apparent from the figure that the source exhibits regular optical outbursts of @xmath30.05 magnitudes in the i band .        shown in figure  [ fig : ogle1 ] are the ogle iv data covering just the first complete year of observations . from this figure",
    "the regular modulation is very clear and reveals a broad modulation with a full width half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath312 d. however , shown in figure  [ fig : ogle2 ] are the ogle iv data covering the second complete year .",
    "there is a strong suggestion that the outbursts are becoming sharper in phase over this year with a fwhm closer to @xmath39 d.            a lomb - scargle analysis of the whole ogle data set after a simple polynomial detrending reveals a strong peak at a period of 27.405d .",
    "the averaged , detrended pulse profile is shown in figure  [ fig : oglefold ] .",
    "based on the entire data set , we can set an ephemeris for the peak of the optical outbursts to be :    @xmath7    the source was also detected in the much earlier macho survey over the period mjd 49127 - 51531 and identified in their catalogue as the lmc star 59.5431.442 .",
    "though @xcite reported no obvious period in those data , a reanalysis of just the red macho data reveals a dominant peak in the lomb - scargle power spectrum at 26.6@xmath80.8d .",
    "this is just consistent with the more accurate ogle period determination .",
    "we can apply the technique discussed in @xcite for interpreting such folded light curves .",
    "we find that we have a average fwhm for the outburst peak of 0.35 , and a value for phase asymmetry of 1.5 .",
    "this places lxp 27.2 just outside of the zone occupied by non - radial pulsating sources ( or period aliases thereof ) - see figure  [ fig : bird ] . hence we assume that the 27.405d modulation represents the binary period of the system .",
    "it is worth noting that the fwhm value of 0.35 is an average , and the values for each year vary from as high as @xmath30.5 in figure  [ fig : ogle1 ] to @xmath30.25 in figure  [ fig : ogle2 ] .    .",

    "the spectrum of lxp 27.2 is dominated by the rotationally broadened hydrogen balmer series .",
    "these lines originate in the decretion disc around the be star which is replenished by the star s rapid rotation .",

    "the absence ( or presence ) of the siiv @xmath21 @xmath19 is difficult to ascertain due to the line s proximity with the doppler broadened h@xmath22 line , however the presence of siiii and absence of the mgii@xmath23 line constrains the spectral type to earlier than b2.5 .",
    "the luminosity class of the counterpart was determined using the ratio of hei @xmath24/hei @xmath25 , which is anti correlated with the siiv@xmath26 ratio recommended for classification by @xcite .",
    "the former decreases with increasing luminosity class ( i.e. from i - v ; decreasing luminosity ) the latter increases with increasing luminosity class .",
    "this line ratio suggests a luminosity class v. the signal - to - noise and resolution of the spectrum make it difficult to draw any firm conclusions based on this spectrum alone , however we note that this spectral and luminosity class are in good agreement with those derived below from the photometric data , as such we classify the optical counterpart of lxp 27.2 as a b1v star .",
    "the optical counterpart to lxp 27.2 was observed remotely at an airmass of 1.45 using the southern faulkes telescope @xcite on mjd 56576 ( 11 oct 2013 ) data were collected under excellent observing conditions and the field containing the source was imaged in all the standard johnson filters ( _ u _ , _ b _ , _ v _ , _ r _ & _ i _ ) .",

    "rxte / pca _ @xcite and present weak evidence for a general spin - down trend occurring after the period of time reported here from the _ fermi _ data .",
    "there is also evidence that the flux was falling rapidly , so the _ rxte _ observations obviously caught the source in the final stages of its outburst .",
    "subsequently , @xcite report more recent detections of lxp 27.2 on mjd 56894 ( 25 aug 2014 ) with _ xmm - newton _ , and with _ swift _ on mjd 56916 ( 16 sep 2014 ) . from equation  ( [ eq : ogle ] )",
    "we can infer that the optical phases of these observations are 0.02 and 0.82 - both close to optical maximum ( phase 0.0 ) and presumably to the periastron passage of the neutron star .",
    "such a recurrence of activity in lxp 27.2 is supported by the last few data points in figure  [ fig : all_ogle ] which show a definite re - brightening of the optical counterpart since mjd 56800 .",

    "the measured @xmath34 is 9.9 @xmath82.0 @xmath35 . if we assume that the pole of the binary orbit is randomly oriented and the pulsar s mass is 1.4 @xmath35 , a probability distribution for the companion s mass can be constructed",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : mass ] .",
    "the probability peaks at 13.3 @xmath35 , with 50% probability in the range of 9.9 - 19.1 @xmath35 .",
    "the upper tail of the distribution extends to high masses , with 19.5% probability above 50 @xmath35 .",
    "the proposed classification discussed above of the companion ( b1v ) would imply a mass of 1618@xmath35 which lies within the 50% range , but some way from the peak of the distribution .",
    "however , this may once more indicate the mismatch between dynamical determined stellar masses , and that expected based upon the spectral classification for ob stars in the magellanic clouds ( see also @xcite for another example ) .",
    "discrepancies of this kind between stellar classification and observed luminosities plus inferred masses & temperatures , have previously been reported for hmxb companions by conti ( 1978 ) and kaper ( 2001 ) .",
    "the estimated fit parameter @xmath36 in table  [ tab : fermi ] gives the relationship between the spin - up rate @xmath37 and @xmath38    @xmath39    we convert this to a relationship between spin - up rate , @xmath37 , and luminosity , @xmath40 , first determining the relationship between luminosity and bat rate , and then applying equation [ nudot : bat ] . since there was no broad - band spectral measurement made during the outburst , we compared the time - averaged 5 - 200 kev spectra of a 0525 + 26 measured with _",
    "integral _ in february 2011 @xcite to the time - average bat count rate during the observation and found a ratio of @xmath41 erg .",
    "we believe the ratio for lxp 27.2 will be within 30% of this value . for the distance to lxp 27.2 of 50",
    "kpc this corresponds to a luminosity to bat rate ratio of @xmath42 .",
    "the peak bat rate in figure  [ fig : bat ] therefore corresponds to a luminosity of @xmath43 . applying the luminosity to bat rate ratio to equation  [ nudot : bat ] we get the relationship @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the luminosity of units of @xmath46 .    comparing this with theoretical models which gives @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the spin up rate in units of 10@xmath49 hz s@xmath9",
    ", @xmath50 is a factor between 0.5 and 1 that modifies the inner radius of the accretion disk , @xmath51 is the radius of the neutron star in unites of 12 km , and @xmath52 magnetic field in unit of 10@xmath53 g. this model can be derived from equations 2 - 4 of @xcite , the assumption of a dipole magnetic field , and treating the moment of inertia as that of a uniform sphere .",
    "the relationships in equations [ nudot : l ] and [ nudot : l2 ] can be brought into concordance by changing some of the neutron star parameters from their unit values .",
    "however if we do this by only changing the mass , the required mass is above 3m@xmath54 , indicating a black hole .",
    "if we change only the magnetic field , the cyclotron line energy is above 511 kevf .",
    "bringing the neutron star mass within the limits currently observed to be possible ( e.g. @xcite ) , we find that a 2.0 solar mass neutron star with a 10@xmath55 g magnetic field is a solution .",
    "this result adds to the increasing evidence that magnetic fields exceeding the canonical 10@xmath53 g may be present in such systems ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the value proposed here for lxp 27.2 of 10@xmath55 g fits very well on the general period versus magnetic field plot for be / x - ray systems in the small magellanic cloud ( see figure 6 of @xcite ) .",
    "lxp 27.2 is an interesting new be / x - ray binary source in the lmc .",
    "its general behaviour is very similar to other such systems , but the detailed measurements reveal the possibility of an exceptionally strong magnetic field in the neutron star partner .",
    "furthermore this is only the second system in the magellanic clouds to have the mass of the ob star determined from dynamical measurements , and like the first one , there seems to be significant discrepancies between the mass estimates from the spectral class and the direct dynamical determination .",
