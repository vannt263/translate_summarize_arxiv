    "in the recent years , semi - inclusive hadron - production processes are becoming more and more important for studying internal structure of hadrons and heavy - ion reactions .",
    "there are three ingredients for calculating their cross sections in high - energy reactions with large transverse momenta for produced hadrons .",
    "the first part is on parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) of initial hadrons , the second is on partonic cross sections , and the third is on fragmentation functions ( ffs ) for describing production of hadrons @xcite .",
    "the perturbative aspect of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) has been established for many processes , so that the elementary partonic cross sections of the second part can be accurately calculated in high - energy processes .",
    "the pdfs of the first part have been extensively investigated mainly by inclusive deep inelastic scattering . except for extreme kinematical conditions ,",
    "the unpolarized pdfs are generally well determined .",
    "for example , one may look at ref .",
    "@xcite for the situation of unpolarized pdfs , refs .",
    "@xcite for polarized pdfs , and refs .",
    "@xcite for nuclear pdfs . because the pdf and partonic cross section parts are relatively well known , the only issue is the accuracy of the ffs of the third part for calculating precise semi - inclusive cross sections .",
    "the first estimate for uncertainties of the ffs was done in ref .",
    "@xcite , and its results indicated that they have large uncertainties especially for so called disfavored fragmentation functions .",
    "this fact could add ambiguities to calculated cross sections of high - energy hadron productions such as @xmath18 and @xmath19 at rhic and lhc . here ,",
    "where @xmath20 and @xmath21 indicate a polarized proton and a pion , respectively , @xmath22 indicates a sum over all other hadrons created in the reaction , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are nuclei , and @xmath14 is a produced hadron .",
    "furthermore , the ffs could be also used for other studies in searching for exotic hadrons by noting characteristic differences in favored and disfavored ffs as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "these topics suggest that the ffs should be one of most important quantities in describing high - energy hadron reactions .",
    "there are two important variables in the ffs .",
    "one is the energy fraction @xmath16 ( or often denoted as @xmath25 ) for a produced hadron from a parton and the other is the hard scale @xmath1 .",
    "definitions of these quantities are given in sec .",
    "the @xmath16-dependent functions are determined mainly from experimental measurements of electron - positron annihilation processes @xmath26 by a global analysis @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath1 dependence can be calculated in perturbative qcd .",
    "the standard equations for describing @xmath1 variations are the timelike dglap evolution equations @xcite .",
    "the evolution equations are complicated integro - differential equations , which can not be solved by an analytical method , especially if higher - order corrections are included in the equations .",
    "they are solved by numerical methods .",
    "a popular method is to use the mellin transformation @xcite , in which @xmath1 evolution of moments for the ffs is analytically calculated and resulting moments are then transformed into @xmath16-dependent functions by the inverse mellin transformation .",
    "one of other numerical methods is to solve the @xmath16-integral part by dividing the @xmath16 axis into small steps for calculating integrals @xcite , which is so called brute - force or euler method . of course , the integral",
    "could be calculated by a better method such as the simpson method or gauss - legendre quadrature .",
    "another approach is to expand the ffs and dglap splitting functions in terms of orthogonal polynomials such as the laguerre polynomials @xcite .",
    "advantages and disadvantages of these numerical methods are explained in ref.@xcite .",
    "there are also recent studies on the numerical solution @xcite .",
    "although the ffs are important , it is unfortunate that no useful code is available in public for calculating @xmath1 variations of the ffs .",
    "for example , the ffs are calculated in a theoretical model @xcite at a typical hadron scale of small @xmath1 . in order to compare with the ffs obtained by global analyses or with experimental data",
    ", one needs to calculate the @xmath1 evolution .",
    "however , one should make one s own code or rely on a private communication for obtaining a code since no public code is available , although the @xmath1 evolution is often used also in theoretical and experimental analyses . in this work",
    ", we explain our method for solving the dglap evolution and a useful code is supplied for public use .",
