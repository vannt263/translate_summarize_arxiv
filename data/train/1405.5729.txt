    "it is now widely accepted that black holes exist on very different scales , with masses that range between 320 @xmath2 for stellar mass black holes ( smbhs ) and @xmath3 for supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) at the center of galaxies and in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , with possibly intermediate black holes ( @xmath4 ) whose nature is still a matter of debate .",
    "recent studies have provided evidence for the presence of supermassive black holes at the center of virtually every galaxy with a prominent bulge and for the existence of tight correlations between  and several galaxy parameters such as the velocity dispersion or the mass of the bulge @xcite .",
    "this bolsters the importance and ubiquity of these systems in the universe and suggests that black hole and galaxy growth may be closely related and that black holes are essential ingredients in the evolution of galaxies .",
    "black holes are fairly simple objects that are completely described by only three parameters , mass , spin , and charge , with the latter generally negligible in astrophysical studies . however , since active bhs are not isolated systems but feed on the gas provided by a stellar companion or on the gas accumulated at the center of galaxies , the dimensionless accretion rate @xmath5 ( defined as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the bolometric luminosity and @xmath8  the eddington luminosity ) in eddington units should be counted as an additional basic parameter .",
    "the determination of  is one of the most crucial tasks to shed light on accretion and ejection phenomena in both supermassive and stellar bhs , because  sets the time and length scales in these systems , and may play a fundamental role in the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "the most direct way to determine  is via dynamical methods . under the assumption of keplerian motion ,",
    "a lower limit on the mass of the compact object can be determined in gbhs by measuring orbital period and velocity of the visible stellar companion .",
    "similarly , in nearby weakly active or quiescent galaxies the estimate of  can be inferred by directly modeling the dynamics of gas or stars in the vicinity of the black hole ( e.g. , kormendy & richstone 1995 ; magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) . for highly active galaxies that show significant optical variability ,",
    "the estimate of  relies upon the so - called  reverberation mapping \" method , where the  test particles \" are represented by high - velocity gas clouds , whose dynamics are dominated by the bh gravitational force and are usually referred to as the broad - line region ( blr ) , since their radiation is dominated by broad emission lines @xcite .",
    "these direct methods are the most accurate and reliable ways to constrain , but at the same time have severe limitations : the methods applied to semi - quiescent galaxies require the sphere of influence of the black hole to be resolved by the instruments , and hence can be extended only to nearby objects . on the other hand ,",
    "the reverberation mapping technique requires significant resources and time , and can not be applied to very luminous sources , whose variability is typically characterized by small - amplitude flux changes occurring on very long timescales , or to sources without a detected blr . in order to circumvent these limitations , several secondary indirect methods have been developed ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "most of them rely on some empirical relationship between  and different properties of the host galaxy or are based on results obtained from the reverberation mapping such as the radius - luminosity relationship @xcite . however , the extension of these empirical relationships to systems with  and @xmath5 vastly different from the original limited samples is still untested , and the majority of these techniques still requires a detected blr , significantly restricting the number of possible agns and the black hole mass range that can be studied .    in order to perform statistical studies of bhs and",
    "understand their evolutionary history and connection to their host galaxies , it is important to explore alternative ways to determine the bh mass that are not dependent on the assumptions of optical - based methods .",
    "an important role in this field may be played by x - ray - based methods , since the x - rays are nearly ubiquitous in accreting bh systems regardless of their mass or accretion state , are less affected by absorption than optical / uv emission , and are produced and reprocessed in the vicinity of the bh thus closely tracking its activity .",
    "recently , @xcite developed a new x - ray scaling method to determine  for gbhs .",
    "this method is based on the positive correlation between x - ray photon index @xmath9 ( which is generally considered as a reliable indicator of the accretion state of the source ; see e.g. , shemmer et al .",
    "( 2007 , 2008 ) ; esh et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ) and the source brightness , parameterized by the normalization of the bulk motion comptonization ( bmc ) model .",
    "the self - similarity of this spectral trend , which is observed in different gbhs during different outbursts events , makes it possible to estimate  in any gbhs by scaling the dynamically - constrained value of  of a gbh considered as a reference source .    with the assumption that agns",
    "follow the same spectral evolution as gbhs ( although on much longer timescales that can not be directly probed ) , in our recent work , we tested whether this novel x - ray scaling method could be extended to supermassive bhs . to this end , we utilized a sample of agns with good x - ray data and whose bh mass had been already determined via reverberation mapping .",
    "the results ( on average the  values determined with this method are within a factor of 2 - 3 from the reverberation mapping values ) demonstrate that this method is reliable and robust for bh systems accreting at moderate and high rate ( @xmath10 1% ) and can be used to determine bh masses at any scale @xcite .    the presence of a positive correlation between  and   ( which is at the basis of the x - ray scaling method ) has been observed in highly and moderately accreting bh systems at all scales for several decades .",
    "for example , a spectral steepening as the source brightens is consistently observed in the evolution between canonical spectral states in gbhs ( e.g. , esin et al .",
    "1997 ; homan et al .",
    "2001 , and references therein ) .",
    "a similar behavior has been also observed in individual and samples of agns ( e.g. , markowitz & edelson 2001 ; papadakis et al .",
    "2002 ; shemmer et al .",
    "2008 ) . on the other hand , in the very low accreting regime ( @xmath11 )",
    "convincing evidence of a  @xmath12  ( or ) anti - correlation has been revealed only recently ( e.g. , wu & gu 2008 ; constantin et al .",

    "the description of the sample and the data reduction are provided in section 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "the x - ray spectral analysis is performed in section 4 . in section 5 , we apply the x - ray scaling method and show that the overall spectral behavior of our sample is consistent with an anti - correlation in the @xmath15 plot , which provides an alternative way to constrain .",
    "the main results and their implications are summarized and discussed in section 6 .",
    "in order to test x - ray - based methods to determine  in low - accreting agns , we need to select objects that fulfill the following criteria : 1 ) they must have a direct and robust estimate of ; 2 ) they must possess good - quality x - ray data ; and 3 ) they must accrete at low level ,  @xmath16% .",
    "our sample contains a total of 53 low - luminosity agns ( llagns ) with bolometric luminosity less than @xmath17  ( ho et al .",

    "for the 26 sources ( 9 liners , 14 seyferts , 3 unclassified ) for which the radio data are available , @xmath29 ranges between @xmath30 and @xmath31 with a mean of @xmath32 . these values are consistent with those of the sample of low - luminosity seyfert galaxies analyzed by panessa et al .",
    "similar to panessa et al .",
    "( 2007 ) we did not find any correlation between @xmath28 and , whereas there is suggestive evidence for an anti - correlation between @xmath28 and .",
    "however , unlike panessa et al .",
    "( 2007 ) the anti - correlation in our sample is not statistically significant : the negative slope is consistent with 0 within @xmath33s .",
    "this can be explained either but the limited number of objects with radio data in our sample or by the fact that our objects are accreting at a much lower level and in this regime no correlation is expected between radio - loudness and eddington ratio , as demonstrated by sikora et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .",
    "we also looked for any correlation between  and @xmath28 and plotted of @xmath9 versus @xmath28 is in figure [ radiolouness ] .",
    "when all objects with @xmath28 are included , there is no evidence for any correlation ( the spearman s @xmath34rank is @xmath35 with a probability of @xmath36 ) .",

    "in a recent study on gbhs , @xcite showed that spectral transitions of different gbhs present two similar positive correlations between temporal and spectral properties : 1 ) a correlation between the quasi periodic oscillation ( qpo ) frequency and the photon index and 2 ) a correlation between @xmath40 , the normalization of the bulk  ( bmc ) model , and the photon index .",
    "because different bhs show similar trends in the @xmath41 and @xmath42 diagrams , it can be shown that @xmath43 ( and distance ) of any gbh can be determined by simply shifting this self - similar function until it matches the spectral pattern of a gbh of known @xmath43 and distance ( considered as a reference source ) .    in the following ,",
    "we briefly describe the  model used in the x - ray scaling method , the basic characteristics of the technique utilized to estimate , and the main results obtained applying this method to agns .",
    "it is widely accepted that the x - ray emission associated with bh systems is produced by the  process in the corona .",
    "the bmc model is a simple and robust  model which equally well describes thermal and bulk  @xcite .",
    "the bmc model is characterized by four parameters : ( 1 ) the temperature of the thermal seed photons , @xmath44 , ( 2 ) the energy spectral index @xmath23 ( related to the photon index by the relation @xmath45 ) , ( 3 ) @xmath46 which is related to the  fraction by @xmath47 ( where @xmath48 is the ratio between the number of compton scattered photons and the number of seed photons ) , and ( 4 ) the normalization ,  which depends on the luminosity and the distance , (  @xmath49 ) .",
    "the x - ray scaling method , based on two diagrams @xmath50 and @xmath12 , allowed the estimate of  and distance in several gbhs by scaling the temporal and spectral properties of a reference gbh .",
    "however , the much longer timescales of agns and the absence of detectable qpos do not allow the use of the   @xmath12 qpo diagram .",
    "on the other hand , the  @xmath12  plot can be easily extended to agns assuming that agns follow a similar spectral evolution as gbhs .",
    "this method relies on the direct dependence of the bmc normalization on : @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the accreting luminosity , @xmath53 is the radiative efficiency and @xmath13 the accretion rate in eddington units .",
    "therefore , the normalization , , can be expressed as a function of @xmath43 : @xmath54 , which is derived assuming that different bhs in the same spectral state ( defined by the value of ) are characterized by similar values of @xmath53 and @xmath13 .    with this x - ray scaling method , @xcite estimated @xmath43 for a well defined sample of agns accreting at moderate / high level ( @xmath55 ) whose bh mass was determined via reverberation mapping and which had good quality  archival data .",
    "the good agreement between the @xmath43 values determined by these two methods ( the rms around the one - to - one correlation between @xmath56 and @xmath57 is 0.35 using gro j1655 - 40 as a reference ) confirmed the validity of this novel technique that can be successfully used for both smbhs and smbhs .    at very low accreting rate however , x - rays are likely to be produced by different mechanisms ( for example by advection dominated accretion flows , adafs , or can be directly related to jet emission ) .",
    "moreover , the applicability of the x - ray scaling method is questionable , since it is based on the similarity of the spectral transition of bhs at relatively high accretion rate ( @xmath58 ) , which is described by a positive correlation in the @xmath12flux diagram .    to test whether the scaling method can be applied to llagns , we fitted their spectra with the bmc model .",
    "llagns with @xmath59 were compared to different spectral evolution trends of gbhs .",
    "the x - ray scaling method results are shown in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "there is a clear inconsistency between the values from the scaling method and those obtained from dynamical methods .",
    "the vast majority of the  inferred from the scaling methods lie well below the one - to - one correlation ( indicated by the solid line ) , and appear to be underestimated by @xmath60 orders of magnitude .",
    "this indicates that the x - ray scaling method can not be used to constrain the  of very low - accreting agns .",
    "the only noticeable exceptions are ngc 3227 and ngc 4151 , which appears to be fully consistent with their corresponding dynamical estimate , and ngc 4395 and ngc 5252 , that are marginally consistent .",

    "we tested whether our llagn sample showed any evidence for an anti - correlation in the  vs.  plot .",
    "the results , obtained using the photon index and the luminosity in the @xmath24 kev range , are shown in figure [ fig5 ] and support the existence of an anti - correlation , whose best - fit is indicated by the solid line and the @xmath62 uncertainty with dashed lines .",

    "the first method is based on the scale - invariance of x - ray spectral properties of bhs at all scales , whereas the second one is based on the anti - correlation of  vs.   at very low accretion rates .      in our recent work",
    ", we demonstrated that the x - ray scaling method , developed for and tested on gbhs ( shaposhnikov & titarchuk 2009 ) , can be successfully applied to agns with moderate / high accretion rate ( gliozzi et al .",
    "2011 ) . specifically , using self - similar spectral patterns from different gbh reference sources we derived the  values of a selected sample of bright agns and then compared them with the corresponding values obtained from the reverberation mapping technique .",

    "we have tested the limits of applicability of this scaling method to low accreting agns with typical  ratio of the order of @xmath290 , which correspond to very low eddington ratios ( @xmath291 ) for any reasonable bolometric correction . in our starting sample ,",
    "only three objects have  that are not extremely low : ngc 3227 , ngc 4151 , and ngc 4395 ( all have  @xmath292 and thus @xmath293 ) .",
    "the resulting  values derived for the llagn sample from the x - ray scaling method are systematically lower than the dynamically inferred values by three or four orders of magnitude , indicating that the x - ray scaling method can not be utilized for bhs in the very low accreting regime .",
    "the only notable exceptions are ngc 3227 , ngc 4151 , and ngc 4395 for which the derived  are consistent with the dynamical values .",
    "paradoxically , the apparent failure of the scaling method , when applied to agns accreting at very low accretion rates , provides indirect support to this method .",
    "indeed , it demonstrates that the agreement between  values determined with the scaling method and the reverberation mapping values is not obtained by chance but is based on a common spectral evolution ( the steeper when brighter spectral trend ) , which is systematically seen in highly - accreting agns and gbhs in their transition between the low - hard state and the soft - high state .",
    "this conclusion is further reinforced by the agreement between @xmath294 and their dynamical values that was obtained for ngc 3227 , ngc 4151 , and ngc 4395 , the only sources of this sample with accretion rate close to @xmath295 .        in figure [ fig6 ]",

    "the two distributions appear to be distinct as formally demonstrated by a kolmogorov - smironv ( k - s ) test that yields a probability of @xmath297 and @xmath298 that the two   and the two @xmath296 distributions are drawn from the same populations .",
    "these combined findings suggest that the x - ray scaling method provides reliable estimates of  for moderately / highly accreting agns with  @xmath299  and @xmath300 .      since llagns represent the vast majority of agns and many of them have x - ray observations it is important to find an alternative way to constrain  in these systems exploiting their x - ray properties .",
    "recent studies of large samples of llagns with x - ray data have provided solid evidence in favor of this anti - correlation in the @xmath12  diagram ( e.g. ,  et al .",
    "2009 ; constantin et al .",

    "2012 ) .    before comparing the results from our work to similar studies in the literature ,",
    "it is important to underscore the differences of these studies . in this paper",
    ", we have performed a thorough and systematic analysis of the highest quality spectra available for a sizable sample of llagns with dynamically determined . starting with a simple power - law absorption model we progressively increased the complexity of the spectral model to account for partial absorption , thermal emission , soft excess , reflection , and emission lines when necessary . in this way",
    ", the vast majority of the sources yielded photon indices in the physical range from 1 - 3 that followed the @xmath12   anti - correlation .",
    "( 2009 ) used a similar sample but limited themselves to chandra data in the @xmath24 kev and used a relatively simple spectral model that for some sources yielded negative photon indices and for other values steeper than 3 .",
    "this resulted into an anti - correlation described by a slope of @xmath301 which is not statistically significant but consistent with our results when using a power - law model ( case 1 ) .",
    "constantin et al . ( 2009 ) used a very large sample of llagns candidates obtained by cross - matching the sdss catalog with x - ray selected sources from the  multiwavelength project ( champ ) .",
    "with such a large sample and the relatively low number of counts ( the mean source count of the sample was 76 counts ) only a basic spectral analysis can be performed providing  values ranging from -2 to 6 .",
    "the anti - correlation derived from this study combining seyfert galaxies , liners and transition objects is again consistent with our results from the power law analysis .    the study more similar to ours in terms of statistical significance of the anti - correlation , quality of the spectra and reasonable values of  ( although with a considerably smaller sample ) is the one from younes et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , who studied a sample of 13 liners with  and  data .",
    "their anti - correlation @xmath302 is fully consistent with our correlation for liners , but slightly steeper than the correlation obtained combining all classes of agns in case 2 . in summary , several previous studies based on different samples and spectral quality have provided findings fully consistent with the anti - correlation derived in this work .",
    "note that the existence of a positive @xmath12  correlation has been widely accepted for more than two decades and is generally explained in the framework of comptonization models by the cooling of the corona produced by an higher flux of soft photons caused by the increased accretion rate in the disk . on the other hand ,",
    "substantial evidence of a negative @xmath12  correlation has been presented only recently and its explanation is still a matter of debate . in the framework of comptonization models ,",
    "this anti - correlation can be explained by a decrease of the number of scatterings associated with very low - accreting , low - density flows and the change of the source of comptonized seed photons ( e.g. , esin et al .",
    "1997 ; gardner & done 2012 ; qiao & liu 2013 ) .",
    "alternatively , it can be explained by the dominance of the jet emission in the x - ray range that emerges in the very low accreting regime ( e.g. , yuan & cui 2005 ) .",
    "independently of the physical reason , the sole presence of this inverse trend in the @xmath12  diagram makes it possible to constrain , because @xmath111 is a direct function of . as a consequence , by using the best fitting parameters of the inverse correlation and the values of  and , which are obtained from the x - ray analysis , it is possible to determine  for any llagns .    with the parameters derived from our best - fitting anti - correlation we derived the  values for our sample of llagns .",
    "the vast majority of the objects have  consistent with the corresponding dynamical values within a factor of 10 with a substantial fraction ( @xmath303 ) within a factor of 3 .      in conclusion , we can summarize our main results as follows .",
    "* the x - ray scaling method provides   values in good agreement with the corresponding dynamically determined values not only for bh systems accreting at high level ( as demonstrated by the reverberation mapping sample ) but also at moderately low level (  @xmath292 ) as shown by ngc 3227 , ngc 4151 , and ngc 4395 . *",
    "we have also computed the x - ray radio - loudness parameter @xmath28 for our sample to test whether it plays a relevant role in the @xmath304 anti - correlation .",
    "we found that @xmath28 does not play any significant role in the anti - correlation ( and hence in the  determination ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the findings of sikora et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , who found that all agn classes follow two similar trends ( named radio - loud and radio - quiet sequences ) when the radio loudness is plotted versus the eddington ratio . for moderately high values of the eddington ratio",
    ", there is an inverse trend between @xmath305 and @xmath296 , which flattens at low values of @xmath296 .",
    "our sample , which is characterized by very small values of @xmath296 , appears to be fully consistent with the flat part of the trend shown by the radio - quiet sequence . * for very low accreting agns ( typically , with",
    "@xmath306  or  @xmath291 ) , the scaling method fails to properly constrain  because its basic assumption ( the steeper when brighter trend ) no longer holds .",
    "nevertheless , for very - low - accreting agns , to get a reasonable estimate of  ( within a factor of @xmath1 ) we can use the equation @xmath307 ( where b is the intercept and a the slope of the anti - correlation ; their vales are provided in table [ tab4 ] ) .",
    "* the possibility to constrain the  in low - accreting systems with this simple x - ray method may have important implications for large statistical studies of agns .",
    "this is because the @xmath308 appears to play a crucial role in defining the properties and the evolution of agns .",
    "however , in current studies @xmath111 uniquely relies on  estimates from optically - based indirect methods , which may not be appropriate for all agn classes and accretion regimes .",
    "the x - ray approach , which is based on assumptions completely different from those used in the optically - based indirect methods , can be thus used as a sanity check .",
    "in addition , it may expand the range of the investigation of the cosmic evolution of galaxies , since it can be applied to very low accreting systems , which represent the majority of the agn population .",
