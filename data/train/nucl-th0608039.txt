    "dyson - schwinger equations ( dses ) are a nonperturbative continuum approach to quantum chromodynamics ( qcd).@xcite they provide a means to study properties of the green functions of qcd@xcite as well as hadrons as bound states of quarks and gluons.@xcite hadrons are studied in this framework of infinitely many coupled integral equations with the help of a symmetry preserving truncation scheme . in the case of mesons discussed here , one solves the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) for a quark - antiquark pair . for calculations of baryon properties , e.g.  electromagnetic , weak , and pionic form factors@xcite",
    "one uses a covariant set of faddeev equations.@xcite    the dyson - schwinger equation framework has numerous features , amongst them : first , it is a poincar - covariant framework and thus ideally suited for the study of hadron observables such as , e.g. , electromagnetic form factors .",
    "secondly , symmetries are represented by ward - takahashi or slavnov - taylor identities , which are then built into the scheme used to truncate the infinite tower of coupled integral equations .",
    "if a truncation scheme respects such an identity at every step , then one can i ) prove exact ( model - independent ) results and ii ) use sophisticated models to calculate physical quantities which illustrate these results and automatically reflect the properties of the corresponding symmetry .",
    "one such truncation is the so - called rainbow - ladder truncation , which has been used extensively and successfully to study meson ground states for more than a decade ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) . despite this success",
    "it has become obvious that certain states and phenomena , such as axial - vector mesons , exotic mesons , or heavy - light systems are not well - described in the most sophisticated calculations available to date . as a consequence",
    ", efforts are being made to go beyond this truncation,@xcite but these efforts are considerable , forcing present sophisticated calculations to remain at an exploratory stage .",

    "@xmath7_{tu } = \\int^\\lambda_q [ \\chi(q;p)]_{sr}\\ , k_{rs}^{tu}(p , q;p)\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the relative and @xmath9 the total momentum of the constituents , @xmath10, ",
    ",@xmath11 represent color , dirac and flavor indices , @xmath12 @xmath13 , and @xmath14 represents a poincar invariant regularization of the integral , with @xmath15 the regularization mass - scale . in eq.([bse ] ) , @xmath16 is the renormalized dressed - quark propagator and @xmath17 is the fully amputated dressed - quark - antiquark scattering kernel ; for details , see refs .  .",
    "the dressed - quark propagator appearing in the bse s kernel is determined by the renormalized gap equation @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the dressed gluon propagator , @xmath20 is the dressed quark - gluon vertex , and @xmath21 is the @xmath15-dependent current - quark bare mass .",
    "the quark - gluon - vertex and quark wave function renormalization constants , @xmath22 , depend on the gauge parameter , the renormalization point , @xmath23 , and the regularization mass - scale .",
    "the leptonic decay constant of a pseudoscalar meson is calculated from the solution of eq .",
    "( [ bse ] ) via @xmath24 which is gauge invariant , and cutoff and renormalisation - point independent .",
    "the first step in the symmetry - preserving truncation scheme described in refs .",
    "is the rainbow approximation to the gap equation combined with a ladder truncation in the bse .",

    "the ultraviolet behavior of this coupling can be taken from perturbative qcd , while in the infrared one makes an _ ansatz _ with sufficient enhancement to correctly reproduce the phenomenology of dynamical symmetry breaking , i.e. , enhancement of the quark mass function on a domain @xmath30gev@xmath31 and correspondingly a correct value of the chiral condensate .",

    "one feature of the model is a specific parameter dependence of ground - state meson masses and properties , namely that they remain constant over a range of @xmath38 , if @xmath40 const .",
    "is satisfied.@xcite this results in a one - parameter model , where the free parameter @xmath38 is varied in the interval @xmath41 $ ] gev . in a calculation , @xmath38 and @xmath39 as well as the current - quark masses are fixed to pion mass and decay constant as well as the chiral condensate .",
    "that being done , further results are predictions .",
    "one expression of the chiral properties of qcd is the axial - vector ward - takahashi identity @xmath42 which is written here for two quark flavors , each with the same current - quark mass : @xmath43 are flavor pauli matrices . @xmath44 and @xmath45 are    the axial - vector and pseudoscalar vertices ( for details , see ref .  ) .",
    "equation ( [ avwtim ] ) is satisfied by relating the kernels of the bethe - salpeter and gap equations ( [ bse ] ) and ( [ gap ] ) , e.g. , ( [ ladderk ] ) and ( [ rainbowdse ] ) .",
    "a direct consequence of this identity is the relation @xmath46 which relates the pseudoscalar meson mass @xmath47 and decay constant @xmath48 to the current quark mass @xmath49 and the residue of the pseudoscalar vertex at the pion pole @xmath50 at the renormalization point @xmath23 .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that the implications of eq .",
    "( [ massformula ] ) in the chiral limit are different for the pion ground and excited states ; namely , in the presence of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking the mass of the ground state vanishes , whereas for the excited states it is the leptonic decay constant that vanishes instead .",
    "ground state mesons and their properties have been studied in rainbow - ladder truncation using different _ anstze _ of various sophistication for the effective running coupling@xcite over a range of quark masses including the heavy - quark domain.@xcite the _ ansatz _ of ref .  , eq .  ( [ calg ] ) , has been used successfully to calculate a large number of pseudoscalar and vector meson properties .",
    "we also used this _",
    "ansatz _ , since it has the correct ultraviolet behavior and thus yields reliable results not only for spectroscopy , but also for dynamical observables like form factors .",
    "it was natural to study radial excitations of pseudoscalar mesons first .",
    "an estimate of the excited pion mass and leptonic decay constant@xcite and the structure of excited - state bethe - salpeter amplitudes , which shows similar characteristics to a quantum mechanical wave function@xcite were followed by more detailed studies of pseudoscalar meson radial excitations @xcite and their electromagnetic properties.@xcite the present work includes a study of scalar mesons and their first radial excitations .",
    "figure [ mesonmasses ] shows the ground and first radially excited states of pseudoscalar    and scalar mesons as functions of the current - quark mass .",
    "[ mesonmasses ] and [ piondecayconstants ] are generated from results for @xmath51 gev .",
    "in contrast to the ground states , the masses and properties of radial excitations do depend on the value of @xmath38 , even if @xmath40 const .",
    "since @xmath52 corresponds to a range of the infrared part of the interaction , this means that radial meson excitations provide a means to study the long - range part of the strong interaction .    to obtain results independent of the choice for @xmath38",
    ", one can make use of ratios of calculated observables , which remain constant over a range of @xmath38 , to estimate properties of states on the basis of experimental values of other states that are known .",
    "an example for such an estimate is that of the mass of the @xmath53 , the @xmath17 radial excitation , where the ratio @xmath54 is calculated to be @xmath55 ; using the experimental number @xmath56 gev this yields @xmath57 gev.@xcite meanwhile , we have performed the analogous calculation for the leptonic decay constants of these states and found @xmath58 in agreement with an estimate via sum rules.@xcite    figure [ charmomegadependence ] illustrates the same procedure to estimate the mass of the first scalar radial @xmath59 excitation @xmath0 .",
    "the ratio of the calculated masses for the @xmath0 to the @xmath60 is @xmath61 . via the experimental value of @xmath62gev ( all experimental data are taken from ref .  ) for the mass of the @xmath60 we predict the @xmath0 mass to be @xmath63 gev .",
    "this compares well to quark - model predictions,@xcite which lie somewhat below the corresponding estimates from lattice qcd.@xcite we note that the @xmath0 has not yet been observed experimentally .",
    "for the pseudoscalar ground and first radially excited states we plot @xmath48 and    @xmath64 , respectively , as functions of the current - quark mass in fig .",
    "[ piondecayconstants ] . while @xmath48 is not necessarily directly accessible experimentally for @xmath65 systems , where @xmath66 is a heavy - quark , it is always a well - defined axial - vector moment of the meson s bethe - salpeter amplitude .",
    "its evolution with current - quark mass is therefore a useful tool with which to probe qcd and models thereof .",
    "one can see that both curves have a maximum at about the @xmath67-quark mass ; for higher quark masses , the size of @xmath48 decreases for both ground and excited states . it is remarkable that this `` turning point '' occurs around the same quark mass as for the heavy - light case.@xcite at the values for the @xmath68- , @xmath69- , and @xmath67-quark masses we extract the values for @xmath48 for the ground and @xmath64 for excited states as well as their ratio .",
    "the results are summarized in table [ decayconstanttable ] .",
    "we note here that for the @xmath69 quark our pseudoscalar ground state does not correspond to an actual meson , since it    consists merely of an @xmath70 component .",
    "however , a radial @xmath70 excitation can be identified with the @xmath71.@xcite furthermore , the ground - state @xmath70 properties can also be studied on the lattice , where recent efforts have begun to study ratios of ground- and excited - state leptonic decay constants.@xcite",
    "we have extended previous studies of radial meson excitations by studying scalar excitations and quark masses up to the charm quark . while in the model we used ground - state meson properties do not depend on variations of the model parameter @xmath38 , the specific parameter dependence of radial excitation properties allows investigations of the long - range part of the strong interaction between quarks . without fixing @xmath38 to a particular value , we used ratios of properties of different excited states to make estimates for , e.g. , the leptonic decay constant of the @xmath53 and the mass of the @xmath0 .",
    "this is made an efficacious procedure by the fact that ratios of excited - state properties remain constant over the domain of @xmath38 under investigation to a very good level of approximation .",
    "for both the ground and excited equal - mass pseudoscalar states we have calculated @xmath48 and observed a rise to a maximal size around the charm - quark mass and a decrease for higher quark masses .",
    "further efforts in this direction will include studies of the radial excitations of vector mesons .",
