    "in the past few years superconducting circuits based on josephson tunnel junction have attracted much attention both from theoretical and experimental viewpoints as possible candidates for the implementation of quantum computer ( see , e.g. refs .",
    "usually they represent a small josephson - junction circuit , called a cooper - pair box , which consists of a small superconducting electrode connected to a reservoir via a josephson junction @xcite . for a flux qubit the circuit with a very small inductance containing three josephson junctions",
    "is described ( in appropriate units ) by the following two - level hamiltonian @xcite : [ hq ] h_q=-_x-(t)_z . here",
    "@xmath0 is the tunnel frequency , and @xmath1 is a time - dependent field ( bias ) which is controlled by an externally applied flux .",
    "although in general @xmath0 is a function of @xmath2 , it varies on the scale of the single junction plasma frequency , which is much above the typical energy range at which the qubit is operated @xcite .",
    "we thus can assume @xmath0 to be constant for the purpose of this paper .",
    "solving the schrdinger equation with hamiltonian ( [ hq ] ) , @xmath3 ( superscript  _ t _ \" means the transposition and the dot over a symbol means the derivative with respect to time ) , we obtain the probability of a definite direction of the current circulating in the ring , i.e. @xmath4 is the probability of the clockwise direction of the current and @xmath5 is the probability of the opposite current direction .",
    "one of the most important problem in quantum computation is connected with the possibility of controlling the state of an array of qubits .",
    "typically the simplest two - qubit operations are generated by interplay of the coupling between qubits and local fields .",
    "much theoretical attention has been recently paid to studying the controllable coupling between qubits of different types ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recently it has been shown @xcite that in the simplest and the most important from engineering viewpoint case of an  always on \" and fixed coupling , a two - qubit hamiltonian may be decoupled and the control problem is , in particular , reduced to finding the evolution of a one qubit placed in a time - dependent external control field .",
    "this observation shows an additional importance of controlling a one qubit state .",
    "this is the main subject we devote the present paper .",
    "usually , the probabilities , as functions of time , show an oscillating behavior ( cf .",
    "famous rabi oscillations , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . but for some specific external fields this character may be changed drastically thus showing a possibility to control the qubit state .",
    "up to now such a possibility is known to be mostly related to oscillating external fields @xcite .    recently @xcite it was proposed to consider a two - level schrdinger equation as a dirac equation with a non - hermitian hamiltonian where time plays the role of a spatial variable .",
    "this possibility revealed a hidden pseudo - supersymmetry which may be associated with a two - level system @xcite and lead to discovering new time - dependent external fields where a two - level system admits solutions in terms of elementary functions .",
    "an advantage of analytic solutions is the possibility of a careful analysis of their properties which may reveal unexpected peculiarities @xcite . in this paper",
    "we apply these results to show the possibility of controlling the qubit state with an external field of a special configuration .",
    "we show that there exists a critical value of the tunnel frequency @xmath0 .",
    "while the tunnel frequency approaches this critical value , the probability @xmath6 oscillates around a value exceeding @xmath7 with a decreasing amplitude and after the critical value is reached it becomes a function monotonously increasing up to limiting value equal @xmath8 . then using the property that this special excitation regime is , in fact , a limiting case of a more general oscillating external field",
    ", we demonstrate that one can control a definite direction of the current in the ring ( i.e. the qubit state ) during a desirable time interval .",
    "finally we also show that such a behavior is not much affected by the presence of a reasonably small dissipation featuring open quantum systems .",
    "we start with reminding the reader main constructions leading to polynomial pseudo - supersymmetry in two - level systems which is done in the next section .",
    "similar to the conventional supersymmetry in quantum mechanics ( for recent developments see a special issue of 2004 j. phys .",
    "a : math . gen .",
    "34 ( 43 ) ) , pseudo - supersymmetry is based on intertwining and factorization relations .",
    "however , in this case hamiltonians are non - hermitian and a specific automorphism , that defines pseudo - adjoint operators , should be involved @xcite . in particular",
    "if @xmath9 is a linear operator and @xmath10 is linear , hermitian , invertible operator then @xmath11 where ` @xmath12 ' sign denotes the usual ( e.g. laplace ) adjoint operation , by definition is the pseudo - adjoint of @xmath9 with respect to @xmath10 .",
    "the operation of formal ( laplace ) conjugation obeys the standard rules @xmath13 , @xmath14 and corresponds to the transposition of a matrix accompanied by the complex conjugation of its elements .",
    "operator @xmath15 is said to be pseudo - hermitian with respect to @xmath10 if @xmath16 , i.e. @xmath17 basic properties of pseudo - hermitian operators are discussed in detail in @xcite .    recently @xcite it was observed that a polynomial pseudo - supersymmetry may be associated with a two - level system interacting with a classical ( i.e. not quantized ) electromagnetic field .",
    "the method is based on the possibility to rewrite the schrdinger equation ( [ scequation ] ) that governs the evolution of the system in the form of a one - dimensional stationary dirac equation @xmath18 where the time plays the role of a spatial variable and the dirac hamiltonian @xmath19 is non - hermitian , with the subsequent application of the well - developed intertwining operators technique @xcite .",
    "function @xmath20 plays the role of a  potential \" .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath21 ( [ h0 ] ) is pseudo - hermitian with respect to @xmath22 .",
    "the next ingredient of the method is based on the existence for any real - valued function @xmath23 such real - valued function @xmath24 and operator @xmath25 ( intertwiner ) that @xmath26 where @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "the pseudo - hermiticity of @xmath21 results in the following factrorizations @xmath29the constant matrix @xmath30 in ( [ jlj ] ) is called the ( matrix ) factorization constant ( @xmath31 is also called the factorization constant )",
    ". formulas ( [ jlj ] ) present a generalization of the factorization properties of transformation operators that take place in the case of hermitian one - component hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "if now we introduce matrix operators ( in block - matrix forms ) h=",
    "(    cc h_0 & 0 + 0 & h_1    ) , q_1= (    cc 0 & 0 + l & 0    ) , q_2= (    cc 0 & jl^+j + 0 & 0    ) then the intertwining ( [ inter ] ) and factorization ( [ factor ] ) relations may be rewritten as the following set of commutation and anti - commutation relations between these operators : q_1,2 ^ 2=0,hq_1,2=q_1,2h , q_1q_2+q_2q_1= h^2-(,)which indicate on the simplest quadratic pseudo - superlagebra .",
    "note that the subsequent application of this technique leads to a more general polynomial pseudo - supersymmetry @xcite . on the other hand",
    "if we start from @xmath32 with known solutions to the dirac equation ( [ dirac ] ) then solutions of the same equation with @xmath33 can be obtained by applying @xmath25 to the previous solutions . in this way",
    "new exactly solvable two - level potentials are obtained @xcite which we use in the next section to demonstrate the possibility of the dynamical qubit controlling .",
    "consider first the case when the external control field @xmath34 changes in the following way : @xmath35parameter @xmath36 gives us the possibility to choose a suitable time scale since after re - scaling @xmath37 , and redefining parameter @xmath0 , @xmath38 , we obtain the schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian [ e1 ] h=-_x -()_z,()=_1()=-12 + for which exact analytic solutions are known @xcite . therefore imposing the initial condition",

    "the influence of dephasing is more crucial and it should not exceed 5 percent of @xmath51 value for bias ( [ e3 ] ) .",
    "we observe an interesting phenomenon concerning the relaxation .",
    "when the probability falls to zero the relaxation smoothes this behavior and can even revert it ( see green line in fig .",
    "[ fig2b]a ) .",
    "thus , in the current case the relaxation may be considered as helping to keep the state of the qubit unchanged .",
    "one of the most popular way to control the qubit state is to drive a two level system with microwave pulses ( see e.g. @xcite ) where , in general , the probability @xmath128 displays ( possibly controllable ) rabi oscillations .",
    "on the other hand it is known that with a specific monochromatic driving force one can `` freeze '' the state of a two - level system ( so called `` coherent destruction of tunnelling '' @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we report on a similar phenomenon but we would like to point out that in principle it can be realized under other physical conditions . this possibility is based on the fact that a magnetic flux with time - dependence like in eq .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) may be realized with the help of a superconducting current .",
    "indeed , according to resistively shunted junction model @xcite the time dependence of the current going through the junction , which may produce the desirable external flux , reads [ ist ] i_s(t)=i- , = r where @xmath129 is a resistor parallel to the junction , @xmath124 is an externally applied constant circuit current and @xmath130 is a critical value of the persistent current .",
    "the time interval , during which the qubit is in @xmath131 state , depends on frequency @xmath132 from eq .",
