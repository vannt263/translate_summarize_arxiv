    "at present , there are three possible evidences for neutrino masses and mixings : the solar neutrino problem @xcite , the atmospheric neutrino anomaly @xcite , and the event excess in the liquid scintillator neutrino detector ( lsnd ) experiment @xcite . these evidences",
    "are individually best - fitted by three largely different mass gaps in the neutrino spectrum , and thus can not be all reconciled in a three - flavor ( @xmath0 ) oscillation framework , unless some data are excluded ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in this work",
    "we grade all possible three - flavor scenarios according to their compatibility with the world neutrino data . the specific data conflicting with the various scenarios are systematically identified .",
    "we treat in increasing detail those @xmath0 frameworks that require a decreasing `` sacrifice '' of data in order to achieve a good global fit .",
    "the scheme recently proposed by cardall and fuller @xcite will emerge as the `` minimum sacrifice '' scenario , and its implications for current and future experiments will be investigated in detail . in developing our analysis",
    ", we also comment on other three - flavor analyses recently appeared in the literature @xcite . this work builds upon our previous studies of solar @xcite , atmospheric @xcite , and laboratory ( accelerator and reactor ) @xcite neutrino oscillations , to which the reader is referred for further details and extensive bibliography .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we discuss briefly the evidences for neutrino masses and mixings and introduce the notation for three - flavor oscillations . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss both hierarchical and non - hierarchical scenarios , and conclude that the latter are globally disfavored . in sec .",
    "iv we identify a specific hierarchical framework that demands the `` minimum sacrifice '' of data .",
    "its implications for current and future experiments are investigated in sec .  v. we draw the conclusions of our work in sec .",
    "it is useful to start by making a distinction between evidences for neutrino _ mixing _ and for neutrino _",
    "oscillation_. we define `` evidences for @xmath1 mixing '' those signals of flavor transitions , either direct ( flavor appearance ) or indirect ( flavor disappearance ) , that imply nonzero mixing but do not provide a measurement of the oscillation wavelength .",
    "we then promote these basic signals to `` evidences for @xmath1 oscillation '' only if , in addition , an effect related the periodicity of the flavor transition process ( i.e. , to the oscillation wavelength ) is detected . in terms of neutrino events ,",
    "evidences for _ mixing _ are simply established by `` anomalous '' measurements of _ total _ neutrino rates , while evidences for _ oscillation _ require , in addition , the more delicate observation of anomalous _ spectra _ of events as a function of either the neutrino path length @xmath2 or the neutrino energy @xmath3 .",
    "the implications on the neutrino mass square difference @xmath4 ( assuming for the moment two neutrino families ) are rather different in the two cases .",
    "an evidence for @xmath1 mixing can only set a trivial lower bound on @xmath4 , below which the oscillation length would largely overshoot the experimental baseline @xmath2 and flavor transitions would not have time to develop .",
    "an evidence for neutrino oscillations , instead , can give more detailed indications on @xmath4 through the measured @xmath3 or @xmath2 spectra , since @xmath4 appears either in the combination @xmath5 ( vacuum oscillations ) or @xmath6 ( matter oscillations ) .    at present , there are three primary evidences for neutrino _ mixing _ : the overall deficit of the solar neutrino flux @xcite , the anomalous flavor ratio of total atmospheric rates @xcite , and the lsnd event excess @xcite . for the sake of brevity , they will be termed s ( for solar ) , a ( for atmospheric ) , and l ( for lsnd , laboratory ) , respectively .",
    "the following additional ( and comparatively less established ) observations may suggest genuine neutrino _",
    "oscillation _ effects :",
    "( @xmath7 ) the solar neutrino deficit in different experiments @xcite appears to depend significantly on the neutrino energy @xmath3 ( see @xcite and references therein ) ; ( @xmath8 ) the atmospheric anomaly of multi - gev neutrinos in kamiokande seems to depend on the zenith angle ( i.e. , on the path length @xmath2 ) @xcite , although with uncertain statistical significance @xcite ; and ( @xmath9 ) there is some evidence for a peak in the @xmath10 spectrum of lsnd events ( see fig .",
    "32 in @xcite ) .",
    "tables i and ii list the above evidences for neutrino _ mixing _ and _ oscillation _ , respectively , together with their implications in terms of @xmath4 . notice that the evidences s , a , and l , are all compatible with large values of @xmath4 , i.e.  with fast ( averaged ) oscillations . in the same lsnd channel ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ev@xmath13 , respectively ) . ]",
    "the evidence @xmath7 constrains @xmath14 to be either of @xmath15 @xcite or @xmath16 @xcite , according to the specific solution called to explain the @xmath3-dependence of the solar @xmath1 deficit [ the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) mechanism @xcite or `` just - so '' vacuum oscillations @xcite , respectively ] .",
    "the evidence @xmath8 requires @xmath17 ev@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the weak evidence @xmath9 essentially excludes that the lsnd detector position coincides with the `` oscillation nodes , '' roughly corresponding to multiple integers of 4.3 ev@xmath13 in @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the evidences in table  ii implicitly require the validity of the corresponding evidences in table  i , or , equivalently , that @xmath18    in the case of three - flavor oscillations , two independent mass square differences , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , are involved .",
    "the @xmath4 constraints in tables  i and ii apply at least to one of them .",
    "we adopt the standard parametrization @xcite for the the unitary mixing matrix @xmath21 connecting the flavor eigenstates @xmath22 to the mass eigenstates @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) : @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and the mixing angles @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 range between 0 and @xmath31 .",
    "possible cp violation effects are neglected .    without loss of generality ,",
    "we conventionally denote by @xmath32 , @xmath33 , the two mass eigenstates separated by the largest mass gap . in particular , @xmath32 is chosen to be the closest ( in mass ) to the intermediate state @xmath34 . in terms of neutrino masses",
    "@xmath35 , this choice is realized either with @xmath36 or with @xmath37 .",

    "non - hierarchical_. if @xmath19 is significantly smaller than @xmath20 , the scenario will be termed _",
    "in this section we classify all relevant three - flavor scenarios according to their spectrum of square mass differences @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and comment briefly on their phenomenological implications .",
    "it will become evident that non - hierarchical spectra @xmath43 are _ a priori _ disfavored with respect to hierarchical spectra @xmath44 .    for any neutrino experiment",
    ", there is a range of neutrino mass square difference where genuine _ oscillation _ effects are most relevant . for current solar , atmospheric , and laboratory ( accelerator and reactor ) experiments",

    "six scenarios can be identified .",
    "the first three are hierarchical , the last three are non - hierarchical .",
    "none of the six cases can fit all the evidences for neutrino mixing ( s , a , l in table  i ) and for neutrino oscillations ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 in table  ii ) , as emphasized in the last column of table  iii that we now discuss .    in the first three ( hierarchical ) cases , @xmath19 and @xmath20",
    "are chosen in two different ranges , so as to solve two out of the three `` neutrino problems '' posed by the solar deficit , the atmospheric anomaly , and the lsnd event excess . in the first scenario ,",
    "one chooses to fit the solar and the laboratory neutrino data .",
    "however , this case is not compatible with @xmath8 , since @xmath19 and @xmath20 are , respectively , too small or too large to produce a zenith - angle dependence of the atmospheric anomaly .",
    "the second scenario can provide a good fit to solar and atmospheric data , but is not compatible with the evidence l , since @xmath19 and @xmath20 are below the lsnd sensitivity .",
    "the third scenario can fit well both atmospheric and laboratory data .",
    "however , due to the assumption of large values for @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the solar neutrino deficit is predicted to be energy - independent and the evidence @xmath7 must be abandoned .    in the last three ,",
    "non - hierarchical scenarios , both @xmath19 and @xmath20 are assumed to be in the same range , thus `` oversolving '' one of the three neutrino problems , at the expenses of the other two . in particular , the 4th and 5th scenarios in table",
    "iii are not compatible with l , for the same reason as for the 2nd scenario .",
    "in addition , in case 4 the evidence a must be abandoned , @xmath19 and @xmath20 being too small to produce observable effects for atmospheric neutrinos . in case 5",

    ", there is no recent , post - lsnd paper addressing case 6 .",
    "since our goal is to identify the three - flavor scenario that requires the `` minimum sacrifice '' of data , we will not further consider the non - hierarchical scenarios 4 , 5 , and 6 listed in table  iii .",
    "the hierarchical scenarios 1 , 2 , and 3 will be instead investigated in detail in the next section .",
    "the analyses of the hierarchical cases ( 1 , 2 , 3 in table  iii ) are greatly simplified if the calculations are performed at zeroth order in the ratio @xmath51 @xcite .",

    ".    for atmospheric neutrinos , the flavor oscillation probabilities take a very simple form , as far as msw effects in the earth are ignored .",
    "the inclusion of matter effects is not decisive for a qualitative understanding and , in any case , it does not require additional mass - mixing parameters in the expression of @xmath63 , besides those listed in table  iv @xcite . in the 2nd scenario ,",
    "the atmospheric @xmath1 parameter space is @xmath64 . a useful graphical representation at fixed @xmath20 is represented by the @xmath65 bilogarithmic chart @xcite , which can also be used for scenario 1 .",
    "finally , in the third ( hierarchical ) scenario , @xmath66 depends on the whole mixing matrix ( besides @xmath19 ) and no simple graphical representation of the parameter space can be given .    for laboratory ( accelerator and reactor )",
    "neutrinos , the oscillation probabilities in table  iv are even simpler than for atmospheric @xmath1 s , due to the absence of matter effects .",
    "the second scenario excludes any oscillation effect in laboratory neutrino beams , since both @xmath19 and @xmath20 are small by assumption .",
    "notice that the laboratory @xmath1 parameter space @xmath64 can be charted by the variables @xmath65 at fixed @xmath20 , as shown in @xcite .      in this scenario ,",
    "the parameter space of laboratory ( accelerator and reactor ) neutrino oscillations is spanned by @xmath20 and @xmath68 ( see table  iv ) or , equivalently , by @xmath20 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 [ see eq .",
    "( 2 ) ] . for this case",
    ", the constraints provided by all laboratory data , including lsnd , have been detailedly worked out in @xcite . in particular , we refer to fig .  4 of @xcite , which shows the global bounds in the @xmath65 plane for representative values of @xmath20 .",

    ", one at `` large @xmath29 '' and the other at `` small @xmath29 . ''",
    "the `` large @xmath29 '' solution corresponds to @xmath69 , that is , to @xmath70 almost coincident with the mass eigenstate @xmath33 . in this case , the deficit of solar neutrinos would be of order @xmath71 and thus negligible @xcite , in contrast with the evidence s. the `` small @xmath29 '' solution is also characterized by large values of @xmath30 and thus it corresponds to a @xmath72 , i.e. , to @xmath73 almost coincident with the mass eigenstate @xmath33 . in this case , the remaining flavor states @xmath74 have to be mixed prevalently with the mass eigenstates @xmath75 , implying that solar neutrino oscillations are almost pure @xmath76 .",
    "the above considerations imply that in the scenario 1 all the laboratory results ( including the lsnd evidences l and @xmath9 ) and all the solar neutrino data ( evidences s and @xmath7 ) can be reconciled by combining the `` small @xmath29 '' solution of laboratory @xmath1 fits @xcite with almost pure @xmath77 oscillations for solar neutrinos .",
    "the @xmath77 oscillations can be assumed either of the msw type @xcite or of the vacuum oscillation type @xcite . in the msw case , the bounds in the solar neutrino parameter space @xmath78 have been explicitly worked out in @xcite . in particular , fig .",
    "12 in @xcite shows that in the limit of large @xmath29 no solution is allowed , while in the limit of small @xmath29 one recovers the familiar `` small @xmath28 '' and `` large @xmath28 '' solutions usually found in two - family msw fits .",
    "it remains to be seen whether the atmospheric data can also be fitted in this scenario .",
    "we have already observed in table  iii that one can not fit the evidence @xmath8 in this case .",
    "indeed , the global three - flavor fits to the atmospheric @xmath1 data ( including the evidences a and @xmath8 ) @xcite and to the laboratory @xmath1 data @xcite favor two different , incompatible ranges for @xmath20 .",
    "however , it has been noted by cardall and fuller @xcite that the sole exclusion of the evidence @xmath8 allows the laboratory and the atmospheric data to be ( marginally ) reconciled at @xmath79 ev@xmath13 .",
    "it must be said that the evidence @xmath8 is somewhat uncertain .",
    "its statistical significance might be smaller @xcite than the value originally quoted by the kamiokande collaboration @xcite .",

    "the results of this new fit are reported in fig .  1 .",
    "figure  1 shows , in the @xmath65 plane and for the representative value @xmath80 ev@xmath13 , the regions allowed at 90% c.l .  by fits to all laboratory data ( dashed line ) and to all sub - gev and unbinned multi - gev atmospheric data ( dotted line ) .",
    "it can be seen that these two regions overlap , although marginally , at @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , it makes sense to perform a combined fit .",
    "the resulting solution is shown as a solid contour in fig .  1 .",
    "its area is larger than the simple intersection of the previous two regions , as is the case for the combination of data that are marginally compatible ; therefore , its shape must be taken with caution .",
    "actually , this solution appears only in the narrow range @xmath82 ev@xmath13 , as also noticed in @xcite .",
    "figure  2 represents a concise summary of the global fit(s ) to neutrino oscillation data ( excluding @xmath8 ) in the three - flavor scenario 1 . the @xmath65 plane on the left ( which reports a schematic reduction of fig .",
    "1 ) is basically the parameter space of the neutrino state @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "as already noticed , the `` terrestrial '' ( laboratory and atmospheric ) data impose @xmath81 .",

    "the mass and mixing parameters corresponding to these three possible solutions are reported in table  v. the given @xmath83 values may vary within a factor of about two , as reminded by the `` thickness '' of the black dots in fig .",
    "2 . finally , the flavor components of @xmath33 and the mass components of @xmath70 are explicitly worked out at the bottom of fig .  2 , for the mixing values reported in table  v.    in conclusion , terrestrial and solar neutrino data can all be fitted within the three - flavor scenario 1 , with the only exclusion of the zenith - angle dependence of the atmospheric @xmath1 anomaly ( evidence @xmath84 .",
    "the resulting constraints in the space @xmath85 are rather stringent for each of the three possible solutions corresponding to different solar @xmath1 fits .",
    "as we will see , the two remaining hierarchical scenarios 2 and 3 demand more drastic exclusions of data . in this sense ,",
    "the scenario 1 requires the `` minimum sacrifice . ''",
    "its implications will be studied in sec .",
    "v.      this case requires the sacrifice of the whole lsnd data set ( evidence l ) as noted in table  iii and related comments . in view of the fact that new , independent lsnd data from pion decay in flight @xcite have recently confirmed the existing lsnd data from muon decay at rest @xcite , this appears a more drastic rejection than the exclusion of @xmath8 in the previously analyzed scenario 1 .    in scenario 2 , one has to combine the _ negative _ laboratory oscillation searches with the atmospheric and solar neutrino data .",
    "the complete three - flavor analysis of atmospheric neutrino data performed in @xcite applies to this case .",

    "the match between solar and terrestrial bounds requires that the common parameter @xmath29 assume the same value in both fits .",
    "this exercise is made easier by the fact that the panels of fig .",
    "12 in @xcite and the panels of figs .  7 and 11 in @xcite exhibit",
    "purposely the same values of @xmath88 on the @xmath89-axis .",
    "the so - called `` threefold maximal mixing '' framework of harrison , perkins , and scott @xcite is a subcase of this scenario .",
    "it corresponds to @xmath90 , i.e. , to @xmath91 ( at any value of @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) .",
    "the point @xmath92 is allowed by terrestrial @xmath1 data , provided that @xmath20 is below the sensitivity of the established laboratory experiments ( that do not allow large neutrino mixing ) @xcite . however , the point @xmath93 is excluded by the msw analysis of solar @xmath1 data at more than 99% c.l .",
    "the same point might be instead allowed by the vacuum oscillation solution of solar @xmath1 data , as suggested in @xcite , although a detailed three - flavor analysis of this situation has not been performed yet .",
    "this scenario has been recently studied in @xcite and , in particular , by acker and pakvasa in @xcite .",
    "it is particularly appealing to researchers of laboratory neutrino oscillations , since @xmath95 represents the range explorable by present and future short baseline experiments , and @xmath96 covers the range explorable by future long baseline experiments . at first sight , this scenario seems to require only the exclusion of the evidence @xmath7 ( see table  iii ) .",
    "however , a more detailed investigation shows that additional sacrifices of data are necessary .",

    "the lsnd data will be reintroduced at the end .",
    "the negative laboratory searches in all channels constrain @xmath33 to be close to one of the mass eigenstates , in order to suppress the ( unobserved ) oscillation phenomena . in table",

    "the fourth column in table  vi gives the expression of the solar neutrino survival probability , as derived from table  iv for the scenario 3 and its subcases 3a , 3b , and 3c .",

    "therefore , in case 3a the atmospheric neutrino oscillations are almost pure @xmath107 , with an effective mixing amplitude @xmath108 equal to @xmath109 , as given in the last column of table  vi .",
    "similar considerations apply to cases 3b and 3c . in other words ,",
    "atmospheric neutrino oscillations are governed in each case by the only nontrivial @xmath110 submatrix of the mixing matrix .",
    "we remark that the properties listed in the third , fourth and fifth column of table vi follow solely from the assumption in the first column of the same table , i.e.  from the negative results of laboratory oscillation searches .    from table",
    "vi it follows that the case 3a is compatible with the atmospheric evidences a and @xmath8 , fitted with almost pure @xmath107 oscillations . however , this subcase predicts @xmath111 and thus no neutrino deficit .",
    "conversely , in case 3b one can obtain a solar neutrino deficit by tuning the free parameter @xmath103 , but then aggravates ( instead of solving ) the atmospheric neutrino anomaly through @xmath76 oscillations .    only the case 3c seems to survive , since with a judicious choice of the free parameter @xmath104 ( table  iii ) one can obtain both a significant deficit of solar neutrinos and a solution to the atmospheric anomaly through @xmath112 oscillations .",

    "in fact , the two possible solutions found at 90% c.l .  in @xcite at any given @xmath20 ( see also fig",
    ".  1 of this work ) correspond to cases 3a and 3b , respectively .",
    "the semiquantitative analyses in @xcite and @xcite found an allowed solution corresponding to case 3c only by `` stretching '' all the uncertainties of the laboratory data ( including lsnd ) to their 90% c.l . limits .",
    "however , the overall c.l .  of this contrived situation certainly exceeds 90% .",
    "indeed , a proper statistical analysis excludes the case 3c at @xmath114 c.l .",
    "@xcite . a similar conclusion about the case 3c",
    "was independently reached in @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "the scenario 3 is incompatible not only with @xmath7 , but also with other evidences for neutrino oscillations , depending on the specific subcase studied ( 3a , 3b , or 3c in table  vi ) .",
    "the claim that in this framework `` three neutrino flavors are enough '' to fit the world neutrino data @xcite is not substantiated by a quantitative analysis  one has to discard at least a primary evidence for mixing ( s , a , or l ) in order to achieve a reasonable fit .",
    "a summary of the data not compatible with scenario 3 is given in table  vii .",
