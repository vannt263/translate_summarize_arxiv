    "<S> in this letter we show that although the application of standard lyapunov analysis predicts that completely integrable kepler motion is unstable , the geometrical analysis of horwitz et al [ 1 ] predicts the observed stability . </S>",
    "<S> this seems to us to provide evidence for both the incompleteness of the standard lyapunov analysis and the strength of the geometrical analysis . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we apply this approach to the three body problem in which the third body is restricted to move on a circle of large radius which induces an adiabatic time dependent potential on the second body . </S>",
    "<S> this causes the second body to move in a very interesting and intricate but periodic trajectory ; however , the standard lyapunov analysis , as well as methods based on the parametric variation of curvature associated with the jacobi metric , incorrectly predict chaotic behavior . </S>",
    "<S> the geometric approach predicts the correct stable motion in this case as well .      </S>",
    "<S> several relatively recent papers have used geometric approaches to describe hamiltonian chaos , implementing tools from riemannian geometry @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the natural motions of hamiltonian systems are viewed as geodesics on a riemannian space associated with a metric @xmath0 ( often associated with either the jacobi or the eisenhart metric ) . </S>",
    "<S> stable motions are thus defined by the curvature properties of the manifold .    </S>",

    "<S> @xcite derived from the jacobi  levi - civita ( jlc ) equation an effective stability equation which formally describes a stochastic oscillator . </S>",
    "<S> they conjectured that an average  global geometric property should provide information about the  degree of chaos and applied the geometric method to the fermi - pasta - ulam beta - model and to a chain of coupled oscillators .    </S>",
    "<S> safaai and saadat @xcite have used the geometric method developed in @xcite in an attempt to characterize the behaviour of the restricted three body problem in celestial mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> they conclude that the fluctuations of the curvature of the manifold along the geodesics yield parametric instability of the trajectories and are associated with chaos . </S>",
    "<S> they also calculated a positive lyapunov exponent . </S>",
    "<S> we point out here that our simulation demonstrates stability for these orbits . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the application of a recently developed geometrical criterion for stability to this problem , and show that it correctly predicts stability .    </S>",
    "<S> it has recently been shown @xcite ( to be called hblsl ) that there is a possibility to characterize instability in hamiltonian systems by a geometrical approach which takes its point of origin in the curvature associated with a conformal riemann metric tensor essentially different from the jacobi metric , which is applicable to a large class of potential models ( see also @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this approach appears to be more sensitive than computing lyapunov exponents or the use of the jacobi metric ( see the book of pettini @xcite for a review of important results obtained with methods related to the use of the jacobi metric ) . </S>",
    "<S> this enables one to associate instability with a negative dynamical curvature appropriate for the geodesic motion different from that defined by the jacobi metric , for which the line element is proportional to the time @xmath1  and not , as for the jacobi metric , the action . </S>",
    "<S> this establishes a natural connection between chaotic hamiltonian flows and anosov flows @xcite directly in the time domain .    </S>",
    "<S> additional problems in celestial mechanics can also be addressed with the hblsl method , such as planetary stability and the pioneer anomaly ( see for example s. g. turyshev and v.t . </S>",

    "<S> it is therefore not a christoffel symbol , but it may be derived as well by parallel transport on the gutzwiller space and transformation to the coordinates @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the coordinates @xmath14 correspond to the manifold for which the velocity field is given by ( 6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this correspondence was discussed in @xcite and will be discussed in more detail in @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> ( [ 7 ] ) coincides with the hamilton equations obtained from the hamiltonian form ( 1 ) , and thus provides a _ geometrical embedding _ of this hamiltonian motion . </S>",
    "<S> the curvature associated with the connection form @xmath15 is relevant to the dynamical stability of the hamiltonian motion rather than the curvature associated with the connection form @xmath16 defined in ( [ 4 ] ) . </S>",

    "<S> computer investigations @xcite of this local criterion show that local modifications of the hamiltonian in regions where negative eigenvalues occur can be used to control the stability of the system . </S>",
    "<S> removal or modification of the nonlinear and symmety breaking terms in just those local regions have dramatic effects on the poincar plots , completely stabilizing the global motion in the examples studied there .    </S>",
    "<S> it was argued in @xcite that instability should occur if at least one of the eigenvalues of @xmath28 is negative . </S>",
    "<S> this criterion was found to be effective for all of the examples we have studied @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our experience with these examples indicates that positive eigenvalues are associated with stability . </S>",
    "<S> it is an interesting question , of course , to study whether there could be parametric instability associated with these positive eigenvalues ( _ e.g._,@xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that the investigations of @xcite indicated a parametric instability in a system that was in fact stable , as our simulations show .      </S>",
    "<S> the analysis given above was carried out with a time independent potential function @xmath3 . in order to analyze the stability of the restricted three body problem using the methods discussed in section </S>",
    "<S> ii , we first study the effect of a weak time dependence in @xmath3 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath10 is not precisely conserved , but we shall make an adiabatic approximation in which we consider @xmath10 to be time independent . </S>",
    "<S> the time dependence of @xmath3 appears in the form of the geodesics generated by @xmath34 as an additional term with partial time derivative of the metric , but in the geometrical imbedding of the hamiltonian motion , the geodesic evolution of the velocity vector field has the same form ( 7 ) as for the time independent potential problem . </S>",
    "<S> the formulation of geodesic deviation in terms of the second covariant derivative , however , as we shall see below , introduces another time derivative , introducing an additional term in the stability matrix . referring back to the discussion of the previous section , eq.(9 ) </S>",
    "<S> is obtained by first computing @xmath35 with the help of ( 7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting equation is simplified and rendered more transparent in its physical implication by re - expressing it in terms of the second covariant derivative . although eq.(7 ) is unaffected in form in the presence of a time dependence in @xmath3 , the equation for the second covariant derivative , eq.(9 ) , </S>",
    "<S> now becomes    @xmath36    which is just eq.(9 ) with the additional term@xmath37using the conformal form of @xmath0 with time dependent potential , the right hand side contains    @xmath38       @xmath39 \\delta _ { rt }   \\label{18}\\ ] ]    near the boundary of the physical region , these terms can become large , but they are generally small away from these boundaries since they involve the time derivative of @xmath3 , in the same approximation in which @xmath10 is constant ( the consistency of this approximation will be discussed elsewhere ) . in our computations here </S>",
    "<S> these conditions hold , and we therefore compute stability using the same formulas as for the time independent problem . the modified eq.(16 ) will be discussed in greater detail in a succeeding publication .      </S>",
    "<S> we now consider the following lagrangian of a restricted three body system : @xmath40 in this system three bodies are involved : a large mass @xmath41 ( the `` sun '' ) at the origin ( see fig.[3bp1 ] ) , a mass @xmath42 ( `` earth '' ) located at @xmath43 , for which we study the trajectory , and a third mass @xmath44 ( a `` jupiter '' ) located at @xmath45 circling the sun , @xmath46with @xmath47 and @xmath48 assumed to be constant ( the first and third terms in @xmath3 are thus constant . ) . </S>",

    "<S> as shown in the appendix the lyapunov exponents depend on the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath51 ( which we shall call the hamiltonian stability matrix ) @xmath52    the standard lyapunov eigenvalues @xmath53 for the hamiltonian motion ( obtained , as usual , by reducing the set of the second order newtonian equations to two sets of first order equations ) are given by the square root of minus the eigenvalues of @xmath54 ( which we denote by @xmath55 ) , @xmath56 therefore , a positive eigenvalue for @xmath54 implies lyapunov stability , and a negative eigenvalue implies lyapunov instability ( the resulting signs are therefore the opposite of the usual lyapunov convention ) .    in the hblsl geometrical </S>",

    "<S> the planar motion that we analyze in these examples corresponds to the known planetary configurations ; this enables us to reduce the problem to one with two coordinate degrees of freedom .      letting the jupiter mass equal to zero , </S>",

    "<S> the lyapunov method for testing stability of hamiltonian motion , as well as the parametric oscillator extensions of the jacobi metric criteria pre47,pre48,pre51,pettinibook are not effective for the case of the restricted three body problem </S>",
    "<S> . the lyapunov procedure , involving a linearization of the equations of motion in the neighborhood of a point on the orbit , does not take into account the curvature of the surface on which the system evolves , and we conjecture that this is the reason that the lyapunov criterion is ineffective in certain applications . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the use of the jacobi metric to define the geometry may also be weakened in its effectiveness , since the invariant interval is the action rather than the actual time ; as pointed out in ref.@xcite , the transformation changing the parameter along the orbit from action to time has the effect of essentially removing the geometrical embedding . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates , as for the lyapunov computation , that the curvature of the surface on which the motion evolves may not be , in certain cases , sufficiently taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> the hbsl method provides an embedding of the hamiltonian motion in a geometrical framework that appears to properly take into account the curvature of the surface on which the motion evolves in the actual laboratory time .    </S>",
    "<S> the hbsl method correctly predicts the stability of the restricted three body system . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the application of the lyapunov method to the case @xmath81 , the two body kepler problem , predicts instability , whereas the hblsl criterion is consistent with stability . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that there are clearly cases where adiabatic perturbation can result in strong chaos @xcite . in our analysis , for hamiltonian systems , even if the hamiltonian function is constant to a good approximation , the contribution given by ( 18 ) could have a large effect if the system approaches physical boundaries , such as could happen in the problem , for example , of the duffing oscillator which has a hyperbolic fixed point . </S>",
    "<S> this does not occur in the case we are studying here . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of ( 18 ) when it is not negligible are under study .    </S>",
    "<S> we further remark that the form ( 19 ) can be easily generalized to treat the effect of several ( unperturbed ) planets on the motion of the two body subsystem , and the method can therefore be extended to a wider class of problems in celestial mechanics ( as well as satellite motion ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude , with this application and others previously treated horwitz , li that the recently discovered hblsl criterion is a powerful and useful tool for the analysis of the stability of hamiltonian systems </S>",
