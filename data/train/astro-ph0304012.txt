    "the angular diameter distance @xmath58 of this universe from a redshift @xmath0 to another redshift @xmath59 satisfies the dyer  roeder equation ( [ eq : gd ] ) with @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "in this universe a light ray passes through the space with the smoothly distributed mass density @xmath61 and is gravitationally affected several times by clumps ( lenses ) located near the light path , in general . since the gravitational magnification factor for the light ray depends on the distribution of lenses near the light path , we can not discuss the individual gravitational magnification factor of a source without the knowledge about the configuration of lenses near the light ray from the source .",
    "nevertheless it is meaningful to estimate an average gravitational magnification factor for light rays which travel in various regions of the inhomogeneous universe , because the factor plays an important role in the theoretical analysis of observed data such as @xmath62 relation .    in the following we consider only the gravitational magnification factor @xmath63 averaged over all distributions @xmath64 of lenses on each lens plane ( @xmath65 : center of the @xmath16-th lens ) in the locally inhomogeneous universe defined by @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the solid angle of the observed region @xmath68 . here",
    "it should be noticed that to take all configurations of lenses into account means to consider observed regions in various directions as well as various lens distributions on the individual lens plane . by virtue of equation ( [ eq : magas ] )",
    "the average magnification matrix is given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 denotes the matrix for the @xmath16-th lens centered on @xmath65 given by equation ( [ eq : ui ] ) .",
    "as shown in appendix b , if the lenses are distributed at random in the universe , i.e. , if they does not correlate each other , the average of the product of matrices @xmath44 reduces to the product of the average matrices @xmath71 , i.e. , @xmath72    we shall put @xmath73 in equation ( [ eq : ui ] ) and assume that all lenses have the same mass profile , then all lenses have the same surface density @xmath74 $ ] which does not depend on the center @xmath65 of the @xmath16-th lens . under this assumption , equation ( [ eq : ui ] ) becomes to @xmath75 and then the average matrix @xmath71 can be written by @xmath76 when the matrix @xmath77 is integrated with @xmath65 in a large region , we have @xmath78 ( @xmath79 or @xmath80 ) since the shear terms @xmath81 and @xmath82 in @xmath83 vanish because of symmetry",

    "keeping the total mass of lenses in the universe up to the redshift @xmath50 to be constant , we consider the limit of @xmath101 . in the case of the infinite number of lenses the redshift interval @xmath102 from the @xmath16-th lens to the ( @xmath103)-th lens plane becomes to be infinitesimal and",
    "then the lens plane are distributed continuously up to the redshift @xmath50 .",
    "thus , in this continuous limit , summations with respect to @xmath16s in equation ( [ eq : as ] ) become to integrations with respect to @xmath18s , respectively , and the average magnification matrix is found to be given by @xmath104 where the function @xmath105 is defined as @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : bint ] ) can be rewritten in form of the integral equation @xmath108    from equation ( [ eq : bbint ] ) it can be shown that @xmath109 satisfy the differential equation @xmath110 with the initial conditions @xmath111 the differential equation ( [ eq : beq ] ) can also be obtained by taking the continuous limit of equation ( [ eq : magbn ] ) .    since the average magnification factor @xmath10",
    "is given by @xmath112 , now we define a new angular diameter distance @xmath113 from the observer to a source at @xmath0 in terms of @xmath114 and @xmath109 as @xmath115 which is the angular diameter distance magnified with the gravitational lens effect . from equations ( [ eq : beq]),([eq : bicon ] ) and ( [ eq : gd ] ) , it follows that @xmath113 satisfies the following differential equation @xmath116 and boundary conditions @xmath117    equations ( [ eq : dneweq ] ) and ( [ eq : dnewcon ] ) are the same as equation ( [ eq : gd ] ) with @xmath118 .",
    "thus we showed that the newly defined angular - diameter distance @xmath113 is equivalent to the angular diameter distance @xmath119 in the friedmann ",
    "lematre universe with the density parameter @xmath3 in which all matter density is smoothly distributed .",
    "we have to notice that equations ( [ eq : bint ] )  ( [ eq : beq ] ) , ( [ eq : dneweq ] ) and ( [ eq : dnewcon ] ) hold for arbitrary values of @xmath7 and of @xmath4 .",
    "in the case of the universe with @xmath120 , however , the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : bint ] ) can be understood as the expansion into power series of @xmath7 .",
    "the second term @xmath121 of the expansion is given by @xmath122 which gives the gravitational magnification effect caused by one deflection .",
    "it is interesting that @xmath123 is identical to the optical depth @xmath124 introduced by @xcite . in the case of @xmath125 it is sufficient to take @xmath121 into account in order to obtain @xmath113 , which is the result discussed by weinberg ( with @xmath126 ) .    in a general case of the universe with arbitrary @xmath7 and @xmath4",
    ", we have to consider @xmath109 itself which includes gravitational magnification effects caused by multiple deflections .",
    "the third term @xmath127 in the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : bint ] ) , for example , is written by @xmath128 ^ 2\\int_0^z { ( 1+\\zeta_1)^2d(0;\\zeta_1)d(\\zeta_1;z)\\over d(0;z)y(\\zeta_1)}d\\zeta_1\\int_0^{\\zeta_1 } { ( 1+\\zeta_2)^2d(0;\\zeta_2)d(\\zeta_2;\\zeta_1)\\over d(0;\\zeta_1)y(\\zeta_2)}d\\zeta_2 , \\label{eq : b2}\\ ] ] which is not equal to @xmath129 ^ 2/2 $ ] .",
    "in the same manner the @xmath130-th term @xmath131 is found not to be equal @xmath132^{n}/n!$ ] .",
    "this comes from the fact the total magnification by the multiple deflections can not be given by a product of the magnifications by individual deflectors .",
    "we have to notice that our average magnification factor @xmath133 coincides neither with @xmath134^{-2}$ ] given by @xcite nor with @xmath135 obtained by @xcite .",
    "these differences , however , are not significant in the range with @xmath136 , but become not to be negligible in the range with @xmath137 even in the case of @xmath138 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bs ] ) .",
    "since our universe is locally inhomogeneous , on - average homogeneous , it is needed to know how a light ray propagate in the universe .",
    "unfortunately we have no such cosmological model derived from the einstein equation , then we have to investigate which working model to be plausible is reasonable and useful to discuss the problem . in this point of view , our conclusion that the gravitationally magnified angular diameter distance @xmath113 reduces to @xmath119 in the continuous limit is the important result which guarantees the fact that the hypothetical clumpy universe taken the gravitational lens effects into account is the reasonable working model to study the light ray propagation in the inhomogeneous universe .",

    "the metric of the friedmann  lematre universe ( the fl universe ) is given by @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the cosmological time , and @xmath141 is the expansion factor which has the dimension of distance .",
    "the einstein equation in this geometry yields the following relation @xmath142 where @xmath56 and @xmath143 are the mean density of the universe at redshift @xmath0 and the cosmological constant , respectively , and the dot denotes the derivative with @xmath140 . since @xmath56 and @xmath141 are given in terms of their present values @xmath144 and @xmath145 by @xmath146 and @xmath147 , respectively , equation ( [ eq : a3 ] ) is rewritten as @xmath148   \\equiv h_0 ^ 2y^2(z ) , \\label{eq : expand}\\ ] ] where @xmath149 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 is the present hubble constant .",
    "it follows from equation ( [ eq : expand ] ) that the relation between @xmath140 and @xmath0 is expressed as @xmath152 furthermore the relation between @xmath0 and an affine parameter @xmath153 along a light ray is derived from equation ( [ eq : tredshift ] ) and from the geodesic equation for the light ray as follows : @xmath154 the dimensionless angular diameter distance @xmath155 from a lens at redshift @xmath156 to another at @xmath157 of the clumpy universe in which a mass fraction @xmath4 of the mean matter density is smoothly distributed satisfies the following equation @xmath158 and the following initial condition @xmath159 @xcite .",
    "the second condition is the hubble law at redshift @xmath156 @xcite .",
    "@xcite define the @xmath29-function in order to express a time delay function by @xmath160 the relation between the @xmath29-function and redshift @xmath0 is also rewritten as @xmath161 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "in this appendix , we prove that the equation ( [ eq : uuu ] ) holds . in equation ( [ eq : uip ] ) , the matrix @xmath44 is a function of @xmath162 .",
    "then , by transforming variables @xmath65 to @xmath163 and putting @xmath164 , we have @xmath165 where is @xmath166 is the jacobian matrix .",
    "we define a @xmath43 sub - jacobian matrix @xmath167 as @xmath168 then the inverse jacobian matrix can be written as follows : @xmath169 from equation ( [ eq : mlptheta ] ) it can be shown that @xmath36 does not depend on @xmath170 for @xmath171 and then that @xmath172 and @xmath173 for @xmath174 .",
    "thus we find the inverse jacobian matrix has a form given by @xmath175 this matrix is a upper triangle matrix of which diagonal component is 1 and then the determinant of the matrix is unity . and therefore the determinant of the inverse matrix which is the jacobian of mapping @xmath176 is unity , too .",
    "thus the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : avuuu ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath177\\cdots \\left[{\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int}_{\\cal d}v_{i_k}({\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\phi$}}_{i_k})d^2{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\phi$}}_{i_k}\\right ] .",
