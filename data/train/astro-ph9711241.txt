    "variability is a fundamental property of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "in fact , it was the rapid changes of the observed optical continuum flux of quasars that led early researchers to the conclusion that vast luminosities must be generated in a very small volume , suggesting that accretion onto a massive black hole is the source of the energy generation ( salpeter 1964 , zeldovich & novikov 1964 ) .",
    "it is now understood that in the bl lac objects rapid variability is the result of strong relativistic boosting in a jet oriented close to the line of sight to the observer ( for a review see urry & padovani 1995 and references therein ) .",
    "the connection between bl lacs and the fanaroff - riley class i ( fr  i ) radio sources is now firmly established ( padovani 1992 ) .",
    "the flux in the extended radio structure of bl lacs lies in the same range as observed for the fr  i sources .",
    "apart from the variability , the fundamental properties of bl lacs are : ( 1 ) bright featureless continuum of synchrotron origin which peaks typically at ir wavelengths for the radio - selected objects ( the low energy bl lacs , or lbl ) and in the uv / x - ray region for the x - ray selected ones ( high energy bl lacs , hbl  see urry & padovani 1995 and references therein for a description of the lbl / hbl dichotomy ) ; ( 2 ) superluminal motions in the jets observed at radio frequencies ( vermeulen & cohen 1994 ; gabuzda et al .",
    "1994 ) ; ( 3 ) bl lacs are found exclusively in elliptical galaxy hosts . because fr  i radio galaxies often exhibit with liner - like nuclear spectra ( e.g. , baum , zirbel & odea 1995 ) , and bl lacs are thought to be drawn from the same population as fr  i ( see urry & padovani 1995 ) , it is then likely that some bl lacs would also display liner type activity if the beamed continuum radiation did not overwhelm the emission lines .",
    "the galaxy m87 ( ngc  4486 ) shares many of these properties .",
    "although m87 is 0.3 mag fainter than ngc 4472 ( m49 ) , it is the dominant galaxy in the largest optical component of virgo , cloud a ( binggeli et al.1987 ) , and is at the center of the corresponding extended hard x - ray component that accounts for @xmath5 of virgo s x - ray luminosity ( bohringer et al . 1994 ) .",
    "m87 is presently the best example of a small disk of ionized gas ( @xmath6 pc ; ford et al .",
    "1994 ) fueling a massive black hole @xmath7 ( harms et al .",
    "1994 , ford et al .  1996",
    "; macchetto et al .",
    "the gaseous disk has a classical liner emission line spectrum , and its properties in the uv establish it as a shock heated accretion disk ( dopita et al .",
    "the `` engine '' in the center produces the best known example of an extragalactic optical synchrotron jet oriented at about @xmath8 to our line of sight ( e.g. , biretta 1994 ; bicknell & begelman 1996 ) . in the x - rays",
    "significant variability has recently been reported by harris , biretta & junor ( 1997 ) .",
    "the broad - band spectrum of the nuclear source from the radio to the x - rays is similar to that of the individual knots in the jet .",
    "the radio - to - optical index , @xmath9 , the optical - to - x  ray index , @xmath10 , and the optical  uv spectral index is 1.46 ( biretta , stern , & harris 1991 ; boksenberg et al .",
    "1992 ) , making it qualitatively similar to optically selected blazars such as 3c  345 ( kollgaard 1994 ; maraschi et al .  1986 ; bregman et al .",
    "in fact , these values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 place m87 at the edge of the region of the @xmath13 plane populated by radio - selected bl lacs and radio quasars ( padovani & giommi 1995 ) .",
    "the jet displays powerful relativistic boosting , strong internal shocks , and significant superluminal motions ( biretta , zhou & owen 1995 ) .",
    "in addition this jet is powering complex radio lobes with luminosity and morphology typical of fr  i sources .",
    "the proximity of m87 , combined with independent measurements of the central black hole mass and jet orientation , make it a primary target for studying some of the fundamental properties of active galactic nuclei .    in this paper",
    "we present analysis of the fos target acquisition ( ta ) data for several observations of m87 s central region .",
    "the data reveal significant variations of the nonstellar nuclear source flux in the optical wavelength region . throughout the paper we assume a distance to m87 of 15 mpc ( jacoby , ciardullo & ford 1990 ) which simplifies comparisons with results of the latest measurements of the central black hole mass ( harms et al .",
    "1994 ; ford et al .  1996",
    "; macchetto et al .  1997 ) , the energetics of the liner disk ( dopita et al .",
    "1997 ) , and the x - ray variability ( harris , biretta & junor 1997 ) .",
    "as part of several gto and go programs , the nuclear region of m87 was observed with the fos on @xmath0 at 6 epochs over 18 months , following the introduction of costar in december 1993 .",
    "the spectra obtained at each epoch were preceded by a careful target acquisition consisting of a binary search ( bs ) followed by one or more peakup rasters , all using the fos red channel in camera mode .",
    "the photocathode of the fos red detector is sensitive to wavelengths in the 1600  8000   region , with peak quantum efficiency of @xmath14% between 2000  4000  .",
    "the binary search data comprise a series of one - dimensional images obtained by electronically stepping the target field in the 37 square aperture across the 129 tall linear diode array . for the peakup sequences ,",
    "the 026 diameter circular aperture was stepped in a raster pattern over the target field utilizing small angle maneuvers of the telescope .",
    "the two types of target acquisition data yield corroborating evidence for strong nuclear intensity variations .",
    "1 shows the bs images of the centered nucleus at four of the epochs ( the other two are not shown for clarity ) .",
    "note that the underlying galactic component remains constant to within the measurement errors , while the nuclear source varies in intensity .",
    "the width of the nuclear profile remains constant at about 0.9 diode widths , which is characteristic of an unresolved point source .",
    "the insert in fig .",
    "1 shows the shape of the radial profile of the m87 nucleus inferred from one of the peakup series .",
    "overplotted is a scaled profile of a star , again illustrating that the nucleus of m87 is unresolved by the @xmath0 .",
    "the characteristic size of the @xmath0 psf at the fos after the introduction of costar is @xmath160 mas fwhm ( hartig , crocker & ford 1994 ) . at a distance to m87 of 15 mpc ,",
    "the upper limit on the size of the region producing the variability is @xmath15 pc in diameter .    at each epoch we computed the nuclear source count rate when the aperture was best centered on the nucleus . for the bs data we integrated the flux above the background galactic contribution , which was approximated by a constant and left free in the fitting .",
    "the integration was restricted to a 101 region centered on the peak ( see fig .  1 ) , which effectively represents the flux of the nucleus measured in a 101 @xmath16 129 aperture . for the peakup series we used the count rate observed at the best centered position . the contribution from the host galaxy in the 026 circular aperture used in the peakup series",
    "was estimated to be less than a few % and was neglected .",
    "both measurements are illustrated in fig .  2 as a function of time , with estimates of the error and the level of the galactic component .",
    "the flux ratio between the 026 and 101 @xmath16 129 apertures is close to what is expected for the relative transmission of a point source ( keyes et al .",
    "1995 ) , and remains constant for all measurements .",
    "2 shows that the nuclear flux changes by a factor of 2 over approximately 2.5 months ( 78 days ) and by as much as 25% in 3 weeks .",
    "the flux of the nucleus did not change to well within the 1@xmath17 error bars ( 2.5% ) for the two measurements obtained only 23 hours apart on 24 and 25 may 1995 .    for two of the observational epochs a nuclear spectrum was obtained through the 026 circular aperture ( fig .",
    "3 ) . in both cases",
    "the spectrum is dominated by bright broad emission lines and a strong non - thermal blue continuum , similar to other types of agn such as quasars .",
    "the continuum is well described by a power law with spectral index @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , in agreement with that of the unresolved nuclear source determined from @xmath0 imaging ( boksenberg et al .",
    "the line seen in absorption has the same redshift as m87 and is a neutral component of m87 s extended ism .",
    "no other absorption features are seen , indicating that any contributions due to stellar light is small .",
    "the ratio of the two spectra plotted in the lower panel of fig .  3 shows two important characteristics .",
    "first , the spectrum becomes bluer as it brightens .",
    "this is in good agreement with properties of the radio - selected bl lacs which seem to display the same behavior in the ir / optical / uv band ( see ulrich , maraschi & urry 1997 ) .",
    "the fractional change at @xmath204600   is approximately 50% versus only 35% at @xmath206800  .",
    "second , the ratio at the emission line positions is significantly lower , indicating that the observed changes are due to a rise in the continuum level .",
    "this is best seen at the position of the bright  complex which is less subject to a continuum dilution .",
    "the ratio in that wavelength region drops to almost 1 , suggesting that emission line fluxes may indeed remain unchanged .",
    "higher signal - to - noise spectra , however , are needed to investigate this in more detail .",
    "the variability characteristic time scale is of particular interest when studying the underlying phenomena . in practice ,",
    "the time scale depends on the definition , wavelength region , etc . to avoid ambiguity ,",
    "we adopt a working definition that the typical time scale for variability is the time required for the source flux to change by 50% . recalling that we do not see variability on time intervals less than a day , a @xmath125% change over 20 days , and a factor @xmath12 over 2.5 months it is probably reasonable to assume that the characteristic time scale is of order 1 month , give or take a factor @xmath12 .    the 1-month characteristic time scale for variability ( neglecting any time dilation corrections for relativistic bulk motion ) and the finite light travel time of the escaping radiation impose an upper limit on the size of the emitting region , @xmath21 cm . compared with the independently estimated gravitational radius of @xmath22 cm for the m87 nuclear black hole",
    "we obtain @xmath23 .",
    "thus the processes responsible for the observed variability must occur in the immediate vicinity of the central black hole .    the total energy output in the variable component is another important characteristic of the source .",
    "our time sampling is too sparse to allow an accurate estimate of the quiescent state , but the observed changes of @xmath12 indicate that at least half of the nuclear flux is variable .",
    "integrating the observed spectrum at its highest state between @xmath24 and 10 kev , gives a nuclear continuum luminosity of order @xmath25 ergs s@xmath4 .",
    "this is only a small fraction of the mechanical luminosity derived for the jet ( bicknell & begelman 1996 ) which is @xmath26 ergs s@xmath4 .",
    "even so , the total power released by the bh in m87 is only a very small fraction of the eddington limit , @xmath27 , indicating that the central engine operates in a highly sub - eddington regime .",
    "the low optical luminosity and the sub - eddington accretion supports the advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) model advocated for this object by reynolds et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "three possible explanations for the observed variability are i ) tidal disruption of a star falling into the black hole ( hills 1975 ) , ii ) instabilities in the relativistic accretion disk ( sunyaev 1973 ; shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , and iii ) jet related processes ( kollgaard 1994 , camenzind & krockenberger 1992 ) .",
    "although dwarf stars will cross the event horizon before being tidally disrupted , giant stars with densities @xmath28  g  @xmath29 can be disrupted at a distance of @xmath30 from the m87 black hole .",
    "the time scale for sudden disruption is a few days , and the orbital period of the disrupted material is about two months in either a schwarzschild or kerr metric .",
    "the expected frequency of tidal disruptions is @xmath31  yr@xmath4 .",
    "given this low frequency , continuing variability will argue against tidal disruption of stars .",
    "if the variability is caused by instabilities in a `` classical '' accretion disk ( e.g. , hot spots ) , the variations in the observed flux are caused by relativistic boosting by the radial component of the orbital motion . in this case",
    "the characteristic time scale is approximately given by the orbital period , and the variability will be quasi - periodic depending on the spot life time .",
    "the shortest rotational period around a @xmath32 black hole is @xmath117.3 days in the schwarzschild metric and @xmath12.3 days in the kerr metric .",
    "hence , a detection of quasi - periodic variability on time scales shorter than @xmath117 days would argue against a nonrotating black hole , and time scales shorter than @xmath12 days would basically exclude the accretion disk as the source of the observed variability . whatever the geometry , however , a very bright spot relative to the rest of the disk is needed to reproduce the observed amplitude .    in adaf models the advective flow will suppress variability due to relativistic effects close to the event horizon .",
    "however , variations in the accretion rate may power variations in the relativistically boosted jet .",
    "superluminal motion is often observed at the base of relativistic radio jets .",
    "m87 is no exception ( biretta , zhou & owen 1995 ) .",
    "the sudden brightening and apparent motion is attributed to injection of relativistic plasma into the jet .",
    "if the injected material carries angular momentum from the accretion disk , it may follow a helical trajectory and produce a quasi - periodic `` lighthouse effect '' because of doppler beaming and boosting ( camenzind & krockenberger 1992 ) .",
    "this model successfully explains the large simultaneous flux variations observed in some blazars over many decades in frequency from ghz to x - rays ( schramm et al .",
    "1993 , wagner et al .",
    "1995 ) .    in order for the lighthouse effect to work in m87",
    ", at least some plasma in the jet must be moving very close to the line of sight .",
    "given that the inclination of the m87 jet is @xmath33 , and that the opening angle of the inner jet is @xmath34  ( biretta 1994 ) such a relativistic boosting can only occur if it is generated very close to the base of the jet in the region where the jet is becoming collimated .",
    "we note that from the ground the usual seeing conditions make it very difficult to measure reliably the variability of the relatively faint nucleus against the stellar background .",
    "the current observations can not distinguish between variability originating in the accretion disk and/or variability in the base of the jet enclosed by the fos aperture ( @xmath35 ; @xmath36 pc ) .",
    "however , further monitoring with appropriate sampling and polarization measurements may identify the source of variability .",
    "nonetheless , these observations have established that m87 displays yet another bl lac - like property .",
    "unlike typical bl lacs , m87 has a faint nucleus relative to the host galaxy and would not be detected as a bl lac if it were much further away .",
    "our results are consistent with the idea that the faintness of the nucleus is primarily due to the relatively large angle between the jet axis and the line of sight .",
    "we thank r.  sunyaev for insights into the variability timescales of accretion disks and the referee for his comments which have helped us to improve the presentation .",
    "this work is based on observations with the nasa / esa hubble space telescope , obtained at the space telescope science institute , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , inc .",
    ", under nasa contract nas5 - 26555 .",
