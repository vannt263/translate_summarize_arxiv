    "examination of the seyfert population shows that narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nlsy1s ) have relatively strong x - ray variability ( turner et al . 1999 ) and steeper x - ray spectra ( puchnarewicz et al . 1992 ; laor et al 1994 ; boller et al . 1996 ; laor et al 1997 ; brandt et al .",
    "1997 ) than broad - line - seyfert 1s ( blsy1s ) .",
    "a favored model explains nlsy1s as systems with relatively low mass black holes accreting at a high rate ( e.g. pounds , done & osbourne 1995 ) .",
    "ton  s180 ( phl 912 , z=0.06198 ; wisotzki et al .",
    "1995 ) is a bright nlsy1 with fwhm h@xmath0 and fwhm h@xmath1 .",
    "there is a low galactic column density along the line - of - sight , @xmath2 ( stark et al .",
    "_ bepposax _ ( comastri et al . 1998 ) and _ asca _ ( turner et al .",
    "1998 ) data indicated a photon index @xmath3 in the 210 kev band , and showed significant iron k@xmath0 emission with a narrow peak at @xmath4 kev , suggesting the circumnuclear material may be strongly ionized .",
    "ton  s180 and another bright nlsy1 , ark  564 , show another noteworthy component , unexplained excess emission close to 1 kev ( e.g. turner , george & netzer 1999 , turner , george & nandra 1998 ; vaughan et al . 1999 , comastri et al 2000 ) .",
    "the first _",
    "grating observations have resolved the complex soft x - ray spectra in some agn , revealing absorption lines in two blsy1s ( kaastra et al 2000 ; kaspi et al .",
    "2000a ) with bulk outflow velocities several hundred km / s .",
    "the absorption lines have equivalent widths ( ews ) of a few tens of m  and arise in gas with hydrogen column densities @xmath5 consistent with those derived from absorption edges using _ asca _ data ( reynolds 1997 , george et al 1998 ) .",
    "some x - ray line emission is also seen , consistent with an origin in the expanding shell of gas ( kaastra et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "a _ chandra _ acis / letg observation of ton  s180 was performed as part of a multi - satellite campaign whose results will be presented in turner et al .",
    "( 2001 ; herafter t01 ) and edelson et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . here",
    "we concentrate on the _ chandra _ and _ asca _ results , with reference to relevant results from contemporaneous _ fuse _ and _ hst _ observations .",
    "there remain a number of calibration issues associated with letg data .",
    "these make this presentation preliminary , however , the results and conclusions are thought to be robust to the expected refinements .",
    "our simultaneous _",
    "asca _ data make it easy to determine where the problem areas are .",
    "chandra _ data were reprocessed using the latest calibration for the gain of the acis chips , and screened such that known bad pixels and columns were removed , as were events with detector ` grades ' _ not _ equal to 0,2,3,4 or 6 . the light curve was examined and periods of high background excluded from the analysis .",
    "such screening resulted in an exposure of @xmath675  ks .",
    "the 1@xmath7-order spectra were extracted from the screened event file and ancillary response files constructed using ciao ( v1.1.1 ) .",
    "[ fig : chandra_p1n1 ] shows the 1st - order letg spectra of ton  s180 .",
    "a lack of strong spectral features is immediately obvious .",
    "the soft x - ray emission component discovered using _",
    "asca _ ( turner et al . 1998 ) is confirmed , and the letg data demonstrate that the spectrum is broad and smooth rather than resolved into discrete emission lines",
    ". this excess must be due to a previously - unknown primary or reprocessed continuum component or a blend of broadened spectral features . in the absence of any detected features , it is difficult to place useful limits on the amount of absorbing gas .",
    "the resolution of the letg corresponds to a fwhm @xmath8 . for a narrow line",
    "we find 90% confidence limits on ew in the range 0.40.7 ev ( 722 m ) in the 0.5 - 1 kev regime , where absorption due to ovii and oviii might be expected .",
    "assuming the velocity profile of the _ fuse _ absorption lines , and using an appropriate curve of growth , we find an upper limit on @xmath9(ovii ) @xmath10 . \"      _ asca _ observed ton  s180 continuously for an 11-day period starting 1999 december 3 . for the full analysis of these data",
    "see t01 . the subset of data which were simultaneous with _",
    "chandra _ show a powerlaw continuum of @xmath11 , but confirm the presence of the soft excess in the 0.51 kev band .",
    "a steep powerlaw or bremmstrahlung component is an inadequate representation of this excess , as its form shows some curvature .",
    "however , the excess can be parameterized by a black body with rest - frame temperature @xmath12 ev and absorption - corrected bolometric luminosity @xmath13 .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the excess is the sum of a blend of broad lines from an ionized accretion disk .",
    "simulations show that a wide range of parameter - space will result in lines sufficiently broad that the horns of individual disk lines can not be seen .",
    "for example , in fig.2 we show how such a blend can produce a broad feature inseparable from the continuum in letg data .",
    "interestingly , branduardi - raymont et al ( 2000 ) find broad line emission from the innermost regions of a kerr disk to describe the _ xmm _ rgs spectrum of two nlsy1s , mrk  766 and mcg@xmath14 .",
    "ballantyne , iwasawa & fabian ( 2000 ) also find an ionized disk a good model for the x - ray spectra of five nlsy1s . in ton",
    "s180 the soft component shows evidence for some variations in flux within the long _ asca _ observation on timescales of @xmath15ks suggesting a size @xmath16 cm for the emitting region .",
    "there is no obvious correlation between the flux of the excess and that of the hard x - ray continuum , and thus the ew of the soft component also shows significant variability within the _ asca _ observation .",
    "the fe k@xmath0 line was parameterized using the full 11 days of data , as no significant variability was observed in the line flux .",
    "the line profile was broad , asymmetric , and similar to that observed in a previous _ asca _ observation ( turner et al .",
    "the line could be parameterized as the sum of a broad plus narrow gaussian component .",
    "the rest - energy of the narrow line ( fixed at 5 ev width ) was @xmath17 kev , with ew @xmath18 ev .",
    "the broad component gave @xmath19 kev , width fwhm @xmath20 km / s and ew @xmath21 ev , yielding an improvement to the fit @xmath22 for 1510 degrees of freedom ( _ dof _ ) .",
    "the narrow line improved the fit at @xmath23 % confidence ( @xmath24 for 1510 _ dof _ ) when the broad line was modeled as a gaussian , but no improvement when the broad line was modeled as a disk line .",
    "the energy of the narrow line is consistent with emission from fe xxv - xxvi , while the broad line is consistent with ionization states fei -fexxv . unfortunately it is not possible to simultaneously constrain the ionization - state and inclination of the disk .",
    "contemporaneous uv data taken with _ fuse _ and _ hst _ will be presented in t01 . here we note some relevant results .",
    "_ fuse _ data show absorption at three velocities near the redshift of ton s180 in the o  vi @xmath251032,1038 resonance doublet .",
    "the o  vi absorption line measurements reveal fwhm 75 , 27 and 44 km / s for the three components , each with column density @xmath9(ovi)@xmath26 .",
    "the uv absorbers are within 150 km / s of the systemic redshift and may arise in ionized interstellar material in the host galaxy .",
    "an _ hst _ stis spectrum with a spectral resolving power of @xmath27/@xmath28 @xmath29 1000 showed no uv absorption lines .",
    "although we can not rule out the possibility of weak absorption at this resolution , we estimate an upper limit on the ew of any civ@xmath271550 absorption line to be 0.3    ( i.e. @xmath9(civ)@xmath30 ) .",
    "_ asca _ observations of ton  s180 have shown a persistent excess of emission below @xmath31 kev relative to the hard x - ray continuum .",
    "it was previously suggested that this was due to unresolved line emission from ionized species of ne and from the fe l - shell ( turner et al .",
    "1998 ) . however , detailed analysis of a similar x - ray feature in akn  564 ( turner , george & netzer , 1999 ) showed that it was impossible to produce enough line emission from either thermal or photoionized gas , without producing other strong the features ( e.g. si , s etc ) ruled out by the _ asca _ data .",
    "another suggestion , based on pspc data , was an origin in a curving continuum with absorption features imprinted upon it ( brandt et al .",
    "again , it was impossible to produce sufficiently strong _ isolated _ absorption features to explain the _ asca _ data .",
    "the new letg spectrum now clarifies this issue , showing that the soft excess is not resolved into emission lines but is broad and smooth .",
    "thus the soft excess emission must be primarily due to a continuum component ( primary or comptonized ) or a blend of very broad features , such as emission lines from the innermost regions of an ionized accretion disk .",
    "the luminosity and temperature from the black body parameterization indicate emission from a region of remarkably small size , @xmath32 cm in radius . using the preliminary spectral - energy - distribution from the multi - satellite data ( t01 ) we estimate the bolometric luminosity of ton  s180 to be @xmath33 . using this luminosity and the prescription of laor ( 1998 ; based upon luminosity and fwhm h@xmath34 ) we estimated the black hole mass in ton  s180 to be @xmath35 .",
    "however , the eddington luminosity is @xmath36 , so to avoid ton  s180 exceeding the eddington limit , we require the black hole mass to be @xmath37 .",
    "two further independent estimates of the black hole mass can be made based upon the variability characteristic of the source ( laor 2000 ) , and the luminosity at 5100   ( kaspi et al .",
    "both of these methods yield @xmath38 .",
    "the innermost stable orbit in this case is @xmath39 , or @xmath40 for a maximally spinning hole .",
    "thus our estimate of the radius of the emitting region appears inconsistent with the innermost edge of the accretion disk .",
    "this indicates a simple black body parameterization of the soft excess is probably inadequate .",
    "the possibility of a parameterization as a comptonized black body will be addressed in t01 .",
    "for black holes operating near @xmath41 , the accretion disk surface is predicted to be highly ionized and the disk spectrum can produce a strong soft excess .",
    "matt et al .",
    "( 1993 ) show that for high accretion rates and black hole masses typical of agn , strong soft emission will be evident below 1 kev and fiore et al .",
    "( 1998 ) suggested an ionized disk as the origin of a soft x - ray component in pg @xmath42 which is characteristically similar to that observed in ton  s180 .",
    "simulations show that the broad lines expected from an ionized accretion disk can produce a smooth and broad excess of emission which is consistent with the soft excess , fe k@xmath0 line and the _ chandra _ grating data .",
    "interestingly , the five agn known to possess a soft spectral component similar to ton  s180 are all nlsy1s ( fiore et al .",
    "1998 , george et al . 2000 , turner et al . 1999 ) .",
    "thus we conclude that this particular type of soft x - ray component appears to be a characteristic of sources accreting at a high rate .",
    "matt et al . ( 1993 ) demonstrate that the spectrum of an ionized accretion disk is a strong function of the accretion rate ( and black hole mass ) , so there may be a critical accretion rate at which the observed characteristics of the source change significantly .",
    "a lack of absorption lines in ton  s180 means line - of - sight material is absent , highly ionized , or has turbulent velocities which are either extremely high ( many thousand km / s ) or significantly lower ( few hundred km / s ) than the resolution of the letg . in the latter case",
    ", we would still be able to detect absorption edges , but none are evident .",
    "the 90% confidence limit on ovii ( 0.7393 kev ) is @xmath43 which places a limit of @xmath9(ovii ) @xmath44 .",
    "the upper limit from the absorption line , @xmath9(ovii ) @xmath10 clearly provides more than an order of magnitude tighter constraint on the column . combining this limit with the measurement from _ fuse _",
    "@xmath9(ovi)@xmath26 yields a ratio ovii / ovi @xmath45 , within the expected range for gas in photoionization equilibrium .",
    "indeed , the gas is very likely to be in a high state of ionization since (  3 ) @xmath46(o / c)@xmath9(ovi)/@xmath9(civ)@xmath47 ( where @xmath46(o / c ) is the relative abundance of o and c ) . some other nlsy1s show significant uv absorption ( crenshaw et al .",
    "1999 ) , thus it is unclear whether or not conditions in the circumnuclear gas in ton  s180 are linked to the presence of the soft spectral component .",
    "the peak of the fe k@xmath0 line is at @xmath4 kev .",
    "if this represents a separable narrow line then the ew implies emission from a full shell of material with @xmath48 , using leahy & creighton ( 1993 ) estimates for neutral material adjusted to a mix of fe xxv - xxvi .",
    "the ionization state is large enough to allow production of the narrow line in the line - of - sight without a significant soft x - ray opacity .",
    "however , the presence of the broad component indicates a significant amount of reprocessing material out of the line - of - sight .",
    "the _ chandra _ acis / letg spectrum shows that the soft excess in ton  s180 is smooth and broad and therefore is not due to a blend of individually narrow emission lines from photoionized or collisionally - ionized gas .",
    "the soft excess could be a primary or reprocessed continuum component .",
    "a simple black body can be ruled out on the basis of the inferred size of the emission region .",
    "the occurrence of a similar feature in several nlsy1s indicates that this type of soft x - ray component may be a characteristic of sources accreting at a very high rate .",
    "a blend of very broad emission lines from the inner regions of an ionized accretion disk is consistent with the _ asca _ and _ chandra _ data .",
    "the _ chandra _ letg spectrum shows no evidence for line - of - sight absorption .",
    "high - resolution uv spectra show only a low column of highly - ionized gas , consistent with the upper limit on the strength of absorption lines in the soft x - ray band .",
    "the narrow component of the fe k@xmath0 emission line could be consistent with highly - ionized gas in the line - of - sight , however , a strong broad component shows that there must also be a significant amount of circumnuclear material out of the line - of - sight .",
    "we are grateful to _ chandra _ team for their operation of the satellite and especially to herman marshall and dave huenemoerder for discussions regarding calibration and data analysis .",
    "this research has made use of data obtained through the heasarc on - line service , provided by nasa / gsfc .",
