    "the macho , eros and ogle data of the large magellan cloud ( lmc ) have already been searched for variables , and in particular classical cepheid variables ( beaulieu ( 1995 ) , welch ( 1995 ) , udalski ( 1999 ) , kanbur ( 2003 ) ) .",
    "the lowest reported amplitudes in these analyses have been around 0.01 mag .",
    "our purpose for redoing such an analysis is to detect as many cepheids as possible , with particular emphasis on those with very small pulsation amplitudes .",
    "such low amplitude stars are expected from an evolutionary point of view , either just ramping up their amplitudes after entering the instability strip ( is ) , or decaying after exiting the strip .",
    "more details will be given in the discussion .",
    "our analysis finds that the macho and ogle data are accurate enough to go down to several milli - magnitude pulsations .",
    "we have examined the 636 macho stars of field 77 in a parallelogram in the hr diagram defined by @xmath2 and @xmath3 this region was chosen by visual inspection to include the instability strip and colors 0.15 blueward and redward .",
    "it contains a mixture of non - oscillatory giants of spectral type f , and variable stars such as cepheids , w  vir stars , and ellipsoidal variables ( binaries ) .",
    "this region was converted from johnson @xmath4 and cousins @xmath5 into macho blue magnitude ( m@xmath6 ) and red magnitude ( m@xmath7 ) using the transforms given in alcock ( 1999 ) .",
    "fourier analysis is known to be very good at detecting periodicity in datasets even in the presence of large noise .",
    "we have performed a fourier analysis of the macho @xmath8 and @xmath9 datasets of the 636 objects with mufran ( multi - frequency analysis , kollth 1990 ) in the frequency range 0.02  0.98 d@xmath10 .",
    "we first reduced the set of objects to those in which there are coincidences among the 8 largest fourier peaks in macho @xmath8 and @xmath9 . for the usual",
    ", large amplitude cepheids the peaks are extremely sharp and these cepheids are thus readily identified .",
    "interestingly , there are a number of objects for which the peaks are not very pronounced , but nevertheless there are coincidences among the highest fourier peaks .",
    "each of these cases has had to be examined individually to ascertain that the detected variability is not spurious .",
    "independently , we have used the phase dispersion minimization routine pdm in iraf ( stellingwerf 1978 ) to confirm the detected common mufran frequency .",
    "how can we be sure that the detected variability is real ?",
    "one of the tests already mentioned is to compare the amplitude spectra of the red and the blue macho lightcurves which are to a large degree independent of each other .",
    "however , since both datasets were obtained in common observing conditions and at the same sampling points in time , they could potentially have a common spurious periodicity .",
    "therefore , as a completely independent test , we have performed a fourier analysis of the @xmath11 lightcurves obtained from ogle - ii and ogle - iii observations .",
    "one possible source of a spurious common signal in both the macho and ogle data could be a nearby large - amplitude cepheid . in order to eliminate this possibility ,",
    "we have checked the online macho variable star catalog and the ogle - ii catalog of variable stars in the lmc ( zebrun 2001 ) for any variable within 8@xmath12 of the low amplitude cepheids . in no case",
    "did we find a nearby cepheid of similar period .    to summarize then , an object with marginal periodicity had to show a prominent fourier peak in ogle @xmath11 as well as in macho red amplitude spectra and , in addition , it had to have a peak in macho blue at the same frequency .",
    "one final requirement was that the phase , as well as the period , of all three lightcurves was the same .",
    "fig .  1 : comparison of macho red and blue ( star 77.7430.18 ) and ogle @xmath11 ( sc4 323401 ) amplitude fourier spectra [ millimag ] and folded lightcurves .",
    "the best - fit common period is 3.3121d .",
    "a @xmath13 errorbar is shown with the lightcurves ( the @xmath14 value is an average of the individual errors given with the macho and ogle lightcurve data ) .",
    "for this star , the macho error estimate appears to be about a factor of 2 smaller than the true error .    in fig .  1 we present an example of the comparison of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 data of the macho star 77.7430.18 and @xmath11 data of the corresponding ogle star sc4 323401 .",
    "the fourier amplitude spectra of both the macho red and ogle data show a very sharp peak near @xmath17 = 0.30194d@xmath10 ( 3.3121d ) .",
    "the macho blue data appear to be much noisier , and by themselves would be rejected as just noise , but there is a peak at the same frequency .",
    "note that the second sharp peak in the fourier spectra , located at @xmath18 , is the result of aliasing because of a large , but very sharp window peak at 1d .",
    "the right panels show the data folded with the common period of 3.3121d .",
    "this common period has been determined by concatenating the macho red and the ogle @xmath11 data and adjusting the zero - point of the ogle data ( on a yearly basis because of the sizeable yearly shifts in the ogle data . )",
    "a comparison of the panels shows that the 3 datasets are in phase and that the variability is real .",
    "this is further confirmed by least - squares fitting of single frequency sinusoids to the data : the fits are displayed as thick solid lines .",
    "thus , in all respects , this star appears as a very clear case of an ultra low amplitude ( ula ) cepheid .",
    "fig .  2 : comparison of macho red and blue ( star 77.7428.36 ) and ogle @xmath11 ( sc4 296029 ) amplitude fourier spectra [ millimag ] and folded lightcurves .",
    "the best - fit common period is 2.2256d .",
    "the errorbars are as in fig .",
    "1 .    fig .",
    "2 gives a second example of the comparison of the @xmath15 and @xmath19 data of the macho star 77.7428.36 and of the corresponding ogle star sc4 296029 .",
    "the fourier amplitude spectra of both the macho red and ogle @xmath11 data show a common , relatively sharp peak at @xmath17 = 0.4495 d@xmath10 ( 2.224 d ) .",
    "the macho blue amplitude spectra appear noisier , although the common peak is the second largest in the blue spectrum .",
    "the diagrams on the right show the folded lightcurves together with the single frequency ( sinusoidal ) fit .",
    "note that each of the 3 datasets on its own merit would be considered weak or marginal , but the occurrence of a common peak in all three , and the phase correlation between the oscillatory parts provides strong evidence that the periodic variability is real .    following the above procedures we have identified the cepheids in macho field 77 .",
    "our 10 lowest amplitude cepheids are displayed in the table .",
    "the identification of periodic variability is solid for all objects .",
    "as far as the quoted amplitudes are concerned , they should be considered upper limits because the observational noise adds power to the peak .",
    "we estimate that the actual amplitudes could be 1020% lower in the noisiest cases .",

    "the stars that lie below the slanted line of fig .",
    "4a are shown by crosses .",
    "on the grounds that a time related to pulsation , the amplitude growth time @xmath30 , is much shorter than the stellar evolution time @xmath31 , one might expect a star to always achieve its full limit cycle pulsation amplitude @xmath32 , the amplitude that a standard hydrodynamics code would compute .",
    "if that were indeed the case then the detection of any cepheids with very small amplitudes upon entering or exiting the is would be very unlikely , because at the boundaries of the is the limit cycle amplitude sets in , respectively decays , with a vertical slope ( @xmath33;fig .",
    "an amplitude histogram would therefore be expected to be devoid of small amplitude cepheids .",
    "however , we have identified a surprisingly large number ( @xmath34 ) of ula cepheids ( @xmath1mag ) .",
    "these stars seem to fall preferentially near the edges of the cepheid is in a p ",
    "l diagram .",
    "( ideally , a color  magnitude plot should also show this feature , but it has too much scatter because color is uncertain by at least @xmath350.05 mag due to reddening variations ( keller & wood 2002 ) while the whole width of the is is less than 0.2 mag . ) it turns out that a recent theoretical development predicted the existence of such ula cepheids ( buchler & kollth 2002 ) , and provided the incentive for this search .    at the edges of the is the amplitude growth rate of a star actually vanishes , so that @xmath30 can be much _ longer _ than @xmath31 in the immediate vicinity of the is . as a consequence ,",
    "as the star enters the is , the amplitude does not immediately achieve its full pulsation amplitude .",
    "rather it stays at a very low amplitude for a time of the order of @xmath36 , but then rapidly grows to full amplitude .",
    "therefore very few cepheids should be detectable during that rapid amplitude growth , and one would expect to find a gap in the amplitude distribution between ula cepheids and the ( usual ) full limit cycle amplitudes . on their way out of the is , for the same reason the amplitude should not decay to zero right at the edge of the is , but the stars should linger in a state of small amplitude . this behavior is sketched in fig .  5 , on the left for a star entering the is , and on the right for a star leaving the is . stellar evolution calculations further show that cepheids cross the is in both directions .",
    "ula cepheids should therefore be found in the vicinity of both the blue and the red edges of the is .",
    "( note that a similar behavior is predicted for rr  lyrae . )",
    "the existence of ula cepheids in the vicinities of the blue and red edges is thus fully compatible with theoretical predictions ( when they are interpreted as radial pulsators ) .",
    "a more quantitative comparison of the cepheid amplitude distribution should be made with the construction of a synthetic hr diagram that would combine stellar evolutionary tracks with the results of nonlinear hydrodynamic simulations along the lines of szab , kollth & buchler ( 2004 ) .",
    "a second theoretical development is the prediction by buchler ( 1997 ) of the self - excitation of radial overtone modes in cepheids and rr  lyrae that are predominantly surface modes .",
    "they dubbed these modes strange modes because of their similarity to the strange modes found by wood ( 1976 ) in high luminosity stars ( see also saio , wheeler & cox , 1984 ) .",
    "this brings us to a discussion of the two egregious stars , namely 77.6940.14 and 77.7548.11 .",
    "they appear as numbers 9 and 10 in the table and are indicated by triangles in figs .",
    "4a  b .    fig .  5 : solid line : behavior of the amplitude in the vicinity of the is . on the left , for a star entering the is , and on the right , for a star leaving the is . dashed line : the limit cycle amplitude @xmath32 that would be achieved if @xmath37 everywhere",
    "first we have ascertained that they are not contaminated by nearby objects .",
    "but that still leaves the possibility of binarity or rotation of a star with spots . using bolometric corrections and  from bessell & germany ( 1999 ) , a distance modulus 18.55 and @xmath38=0.18 ( keller & wood 2002 ; marconi & clementini 2005 ) , we find for star 77.6940.14 , @xmath39=2510 , @xmath40=5 , = 6200k and @xmath41= 44 ; and for star 77.7548.11 : @xmath42 = 6730 , @xmath40= 6.5 , = 5400k , @xmath43=94 .",
    "given the observed periods @xmath44=1.32d and @xmath45= 6.03d , respectively , the corresponding orbital radius of any ( light ) companion would be @xmath46=9  and @xmath47= 26 , or 0.14 and 0.28 times the stellar radius . under the above assumptions , the small orbital radii required definitively rule out the binary hypothesis .",
    "similarly , rotation can also be eliminated as an explanation because the rotation velocity derived from the observed period and stellar radius is greater than the rotational breakup velocity ( by factors of 11.4 and 6.8 , respectively ) .",
    "we note , however , that the above arguments fail if these two stars are foreground stars of much lower luminosity than assumed .",
    "unfortunately , these stars are in a region of the lmc hr - diagram where foreground contamination is large ( the number of lmc and foreground stars are comparable - see alcock 2000 ) .",
    "radial velocity measurements would be required to confirm lmc membership .",
    "however , the fact that they fall this close to the cepheid pl relation suggests that they are probably lmc members .",
    "assuming these two stars are in the lmc , pulsation in strange modes is the likely explanation for their variability .",
    "the periods of the two stars are indeed a factor of 56 lower than the periods of f cepheid periods of equal apparent magnitude , and in agreement with the expected periods of strange cepheids ( buchler & kollath , 2001 ) .",
    "the amplitudes , @xmath480.03mag , of these stars are perhaps a little larger than the theoretical estimates , but they are within their uncertainty .",
    "a search for strange cepheids in the remaining macho lmc fields would be desirable as it would strengthen the status of this novel type of cepheids .",
