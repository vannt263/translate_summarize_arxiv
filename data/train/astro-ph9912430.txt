    "a new tool is now available to probe the population of recently formed massive stars , while still embedded in their parent clouds .",
    "such stars are surrounded by a compact hii region , with an ionization front working outwards into the cloud .",
    "regions undergoing massive star formation contain one or more ultra - compact hii ( uchii ) regions , and possibly more evolved hii regions .",
    "bronfman et al . ( 1996 , bnm ) completed a survey in cs(21 ) towards iras point sources satisfying the wood & churchwell ( 1989a ) far - infrared ( fir ) colour criteria for uchii regions .",
    "the cs molecule is a tracer of high density molecular gas ; a cs(21 ) detection strengthens the uchii region identification and provides kinematic information .",
    "bnm detected 843 sources ( hereafter iras / cs sources ) , whose azimuthally averaged galactic distribution is presented in bronfman et al .",
    "( 2000 , bcmn ) . in this work",
    "we construct the luminosity function ( lf ) for the iras / cs sources , and show that it presents significant variations with galactocentric radius .",
    "we interpret the shape of the iras / cs sources lf and its variations in terms of an ensemble of massive star forming regions .",
    "the stellar content of iras / cs sources is characterised by the number of stars and their mass spectrum which , because of the youth of the systems , is taken to represent closely their initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "the use of young tracers to derive the imf minimises the dependence on modelling , which afflicts most previous studies .",
    "the standard approach to determining the high mass end of the imf has been through o and b star counts in the solar neighbourhood ( e.g. miller & scalo 1979 , lequeux 1979 ) .",
    "the average mass spectrum of newly formed stars is taken as a power law , and the value of the exponent characterises the imf .",
    "these approaches require assumptions on the star formation history , and have the drawback of not probing the whole galactic disk .",
    "garmany et al .",
    "( 1982 ) addressed the question of large scale variations in the imf exponent , and they favour a decrease with galactocentric radius ( although their result has been reinterpreted , e.g. massey 1998 ) .",
    "a different tool was used by vzquez & feinstein ( 1989 ) , who linked the variations in the open cluster luminosity function ( burki 1977 ) to variations in the imf index .",
    "young objects such as hii regions have also been used to study massive stars in the galactic context .",
    "mckee & williams ( 1997 , mw97 ) characterised the population of newly formed massive stars through the luminosity function of ob associations .",
    "the ionising luminosity absorbed by the gas surrounding ob associations can be traced through the radio flux of hii regions , and the frequency distribution in luminosity of hii regions is in turn a function of the number of exciting stars and their masses . however , mw97 a - priori fixed the shape of the imf and the distribution for the number of exciting stars .",
    "this method is also strongly model dependent due to the lack of complete information on galactic hii regions , and the fact that the population of hii regions is not homogeneous in age .",
    "comern & torra ( 1996 , ct96 ) also analysed the galactic disk distribution of newly formed massive stars , through a sample of iras point sources with colours of uchii regions .",
    "but they did not use kinematic information to derive the galactic distribution of the uchii regions , and their work is based on a position - independent lf .",
    "the aims of this work are to present the fir lf of massive star forming regions still embedded in their parent clouds ; to investigate the lf large scale variations ; and to analyse the lf in terms of the embedded stars mass spectrum . in sect .",

    "the results of this analysis and the questions of the number and the mass spectrum of stars per msfr will be addressed in sect . [",

    "section [ sec : lifetimes ] is a brief estimate of the fraction of lifetime o stars spend in the embedded phase . in sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] we summarise our conclusions .",
    "the velocity information provided by the cs(21 ) observations from bnm allows , through the adoption of a rotation curve , to derive their galactocentric distances , and hence their heliocentric distances and luminosities .",
    "the galactic disk is assumed to be in circular motion , with @xmath14kpc and @xmath15 kms@xmath16 . for the region of the galaxy outside the solar circle ( outer galaxy )",
    "the procedure is a simple coordinate transformation from galactic longitude , latitude and velocity ( @xmath17 ) to galactocentric radius , height over the plane and azimuth ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "but such a transformation is bivalued for the region within the solar circle ( inner galaxy ) .",
    "there is a heliocentric distance ambiguity such that , unless a source lies just on the subcentral point ( the tangent point to a galactocentric ring for a given longitude ) , there are two points along the line of sight , at the same distance on both sides of the subcentral point , that have the same line of sight velocity .    the method we used to resolve the distance ambiguity is described in bcmn .",
    "it is a statistical method that consists in weighting the near and far distances with a normal distribution in height over the galactic plane .",
    "each source is assigned an effective luminosity , which is the weighted average of the near and far luminosities .",
    "the centroid and width of the vertical distribution , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , are determined through an iterative process for galactocentric bins",
    "@xmath21 wide .",
    "a consistency check for this method can be found below in this section .",
    "the kinematic distances are not reliable in the direction of the galactic centre , and also when the line of sight velocities are of the same order as the non - circular velocity components .",
    "therefore , we excluded from the present analysis all sources within @xmath22 of the galactic centre , and within @xmath23 of the galactic anti - centre , as well as sources with @xmath24 .",
    "the resulting range in galactocentric radius , where the disk is properly sampled , excludes the solar circle .",
    "we restricted the analysis to sources with @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the sources close to the subcentral points are an important consistency check of our method to resolve the distance ambiguity within the solar circle .",
    "the kinematic distance of a source at the subcentral point and in pure circular motion about the galactic centre is uniquely determined .",
    "the subcentral sources sample was defined as the subset with line of sight velocities no more than 10  kms@xmath16 different in absolute value from the terminal velocity ( the maximum velocity expected for a given longitude in the case of circular rotation ) .",
    "we estimate the far infrared flux of an iras / cs source by summing over the four iras bands , @xmath27 where @xmath28 are the iras band flux densities , as listed in the iras point source catalog ( 1985 ) . in order to test this approximation we compared with the total fluxes reported for 53 uchii regions by wood & churchell ( 1989b , wc89 , their tables 17 and 18 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : fir]a shows the ratio of the @xmath29 fluxes ( obtained by eq .",
    "[ eq : firas ] ) to the total fluxes of wc89 ( which are integrated up to 100@xmath30 m ) , as a function of @xmath29 .",
    "equation [ eq : firas ] overestimates the wc89 fluxes by about a constant 20% , but wc89 did not include a correction for the 100@xmath30 m  1 mm flux , which they estimate could be as high as 50% .",
    "we thus expect eq .",
    "[ eq : firas ] to be a good estimate of the total luminosity of iras / cs sources within 30% ( 50%  20% ) .    since we will average the luminosity function of uchii regions over large areas of the galactic disk , it is important to estimate the minimum luminosity above which the disk is properly sampled .",
    "the lowest flux @xmath29 in the sample , @xmath31 wm@xmath32 , corresponds to @xmath33 at a distance of 15  kpc .",
    "figure [ fig : fir]b shows a histogram of the total number of sources in our sample as a function of @xmath29 ( without the velocity filter @xmath34 ) .",
    "the triangles show the fraction of sources with only upper limits in the 100@xmath30 m band ( right hand scale ) .",
    "could a significant number of sources be missed by iras near the minimum detected flux ?",
    "a lower @xmath29 sensitivity would be hinted at by an increased fraction of upper limits in the reported iras fluxes , which is not the case .",
    "however , the higher far - ir background towards the central regions of the galaxy results in a completeness limit of @xmath35 at 8.5  kpc , within @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "but over a broader longitude range , @xmath38 at 8.5  kpc , within @xmath39 , @xmath37 .",
    "as the luminosity functions of the subcentral sources ( which are all within 8.5  kpc of the sun ) is in good agreement with that of the whole inner galaxy ( see below ) , we take @xmath40 as the completeness limit of the iras / cs sample .",
    "the lf of the whole sample of iras / cs sources , our main observational result , appears to be significantly different inside and outside the solar circle ; in fig .",
    "[ fig : lf_gal ] we distinguish between @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the lfs cover a very wide range in luminosity , over three orders of magnitude , which allows using logarithmic luminosity bins corresponding to a factor of 300% . within the solar circle",
    "the lf obtained using the effective luminosities is confirmed to be a good estimate of the actual lf through its close similarity with the lf of the sources near the subcentral points , shown in dotted line were excluded : our definition of the subcentral source sample would otherwise include most sources in that region , because the non - circular velocity components dominate the spread about the terminal velocity ] .",
    "for comparison , placing all the sources at the ` near ' or ` far ' kinematic distance changes the peak of the lf as a function of logarithmic luminosity from 4.25 to 5.75 , while the lf obtained using the effective luminosities peaks at 5.25 .",
    "the good match with the subcentral source sample lf lends strength to a comparison of the luminosity functions between the outer and inner galaxy , based on the effective luminosities .",
    "we will refer to the luminosity functions for the whole inner and outer galaxy by lf@xmath43 and lf@xmath44 .",
    "the dominant source of uncertainty in the lf is shot noise . the errors in the galactic disk surface fir luminosity amount to about 10% upwards , 20% downwards ( fig .",
    "3 in bcmn ) .",
    "the fractional error on the fir surface luminosity represents the typical fractional error on the luminosity of one source .",
    "these errors stem from the iras 100@xmath30 m band flux uncertainty , coupled with the kinematic distance uncertainty due to non - circular motions of about 5  kms@xmath16 . adding in quadrature the 30% uncertainty related to the use of eq .",
    "[ eq : firas ] , we have an average error on the luminosity of a source of at most 36% . compared to the 300% width of the luminosity bins , a 36% uncertainty is negligible , apart from a slight smoothing effect without practical consequence .",
    "the differences in the lfs inside and outside the solar circle are statistically significant . as a statistic for the difference between the inner and outer lfs",
    ", we used a @xmath45 test which has the following expression in this context , @xmath46 where we sum over the bins above the luminosity limit of 10@xmath47 .",
    "the result is @xmath48 , or that lf@xmath43 and lf@xmath44 are different at a significance level of 95.6% ( with a @xmath49 distribution for 5 degrees of freedom , corresponding to the number of bins with non - zero counts above the luminosity limit ) . for comparison , the same test applied to the northern and southern as the northern galaxy , while longitudes greater than @xmath50 correspond to the southern galaxy ] lfs inside the solar circle gives a probability of 45% that the distributions are different , so they are comparable relative to the differences between the lfs inside and outside the solar circle .",
    "another application of this statistical test gives that lf@xmath43 and the subcentral source lf are the same at a confidence level of 87% .",
    "we emphasize the presence of a peak in the lf of iras / cs sources , well above the completeness limit .",
    "the strongest evidence in that sense can be found in the lfs for the outer galaxy and for the subcentral sources , where the @xmath51 completeness limits are lowest .",
    "the shape for the lf we report is quite different from a power law functional form ( e.g. as used in ct96 ) .",
    "one immediate consequence of the shape of the iras / cs luminosity function is that these sources are better understood as clusters of stars rather than in the framework of one dominant star per source .",
    "a single exciting star would result in a power law lf : an imf index @xmath7 ( see below ) , and mass - luminosity relation @xmath52 , give a probability distribution in luminosity @xmath53 .",
    "we used a simple model to examine whether the variations in the lfs of iras / cs sources from inside to outside the solar circle can be traced to the underlying young stellar population .",
    "we proceed to describe a monte carlo analysis for the ensemble of massive star forming regions in the galactic disk .",
    "the luminosity of a msfr is the sum of the luminosities of each star , given by the mass - luminosity relationship .",
    "we used a polynomial fit to the mass - luminosity relation of the tracks presented in schaller et al .",
    "( 1992 ) for z=0.02 , at the first time step they list , @xmath54 the metallicity dependence of the mass - luminosity relation was neglected , as the z=0.001 tracks in schaller et al .",
    "( 1992 ) have luminosities within 10% of eq .",
    "[ eq : m - l ] for @xmath55 .",
    "the synthetic population of msfrs was generated in the following way .",
    "the number of stars in a given msfr , @xmath56 , is generated randomly within the range @xmath57 , and subject to a power law probability distribution with exponent @xmath4 , @xmath58 .",
    "a discussion of the model sensitivity on @xmath59 will be found in sect .",
    "[ sec : paramspace ] . given @xmath56 , the total luminosity of a msfr",
    "is calculated by summing the individual luminosities of each star , using the mass - luminosity relationship .",
    "the mass of each star is generated randomly , within the range @xmath13 and satisfying the imf distribution , @xmath60 in this notation the salpeter ( 1955 ) imf corresponds to @xmath61 .",
    "thus the luminosity of each msfr is randomly generated with @xmath62 , and an ensemble of 5000 msfrs provides a population large enough to compute the synthetic luminosity function ( that this is one order of magnitude larger than the number considered in the observed lf does not affect the results , only helps to reduce the random fluctuations ) .",
    "an important simplification in this approach is that the ensemble of msfrs is assumed to be homogeneous in age ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : lifetimes ] ) .",
    "furthermore , it should be mentioned before discussing the results of the model that the mass - luminosity relation remains mainly theoretical for massive stars .",
    "although burkholder et al .",
    "( 1997 ) give observational evidence that support the massive star models up to @xmath63 , the upper mass limit we used is @xmath64 , where to our knowledge no direct observational information exists to back the theoretical models .",
    "a first broad search for the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath9 requires specifying @xmath65 .",
    "it could be thought firsthand that any value of @xmath65 high enough to simulate infinity would do , but we tried @xmath66 and did not obtain any fit , over the range @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",
    "we distinguished three cases , fixing the maximum number of stars per msfr , @xmath65 , to 500 , 1000 and 2000 .",
    "figure [ fig : paramspace ] shows the @xmath45 cumulative probability for the goodness of fit as a function of parameter space . in the observed iras / cs",
    "lf , we have five bins with non - zero counts above the completeness limit of 10@xmath47 .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom is thus 3 , which corresponds to the five bins in comparison less two free parameters ( @xmath7 and @xmath9 ) .",
    "the fit to lf@xmath44 is a lot more noisy , a consequence of the reduced number of iras / cs sources used to compute the lf .",
    "it is apparent that for any value of @xmath65 , @xmath7 is similar inside and outside the solar circle , while the acceptable values for @xmath9 are markedly different .",
    "it can also be noticed from fig .",
    "[ fig : paramspace ] that the best fit @xmath9 are rather independent of @xmath65 , in contrast with the behaviour of the best fit imf index @xmath7 . for @xmath69 ,",
    "the imf index in the inner galaxy , at 50% confidence level for the goodness of fit ( with two free parameters ) , corresponds to @xmath70 .",
    "this is very close to the result for the outer galaxy , @xmath71 .",
    "the case where @xmath72 seems to give better results for @xmath73 , and constrains @xmath74 at 50% confidence .",
    "this range of values , @xmath75 for @xmath76 and @xmath77 for @xmath73 , will be used as an indication of the uncertainty level in the best fit @xmath7 .",
    "as the distribution of @xmath56 seems to be a bounded power law , there exists a maximum for the number of stars born in a msfr within a finite mass range .",
    "it should be kept in mind that the total number of stars could in fact depend on the stellar masses and the star formation history of a msfr ; we expect the parameter @xmath56 to synthesise more complex processes .",
    "observational constraints to fix @xmath65 are difficult to find , because stellar censuses are available only for much larger regions like ob associations , open clusters , or longer lived hii regions .",
    "after finding reasonable values for @xmath65 , we extend the search to include all three parameters , and obtain @xmath78 thus the best fitting sets of parameters have @xmath79 .",
    "values for the significance of the fits are @xmath80 , with two degrees of freedom ( 5 bins in comparison less 3 free parameters ) .",
    "figure [ fig : fitlf ] shows the models that best fit the lfs . due to the monte carlo approach , secondary @xmath49 minima are found about the true minimum .",
    "multiple minimization runs with various initial guesses fluctuate about the above values : from @xmath81 to @xmath82 for @xmath41 .    keeping @xmath65 fixed at the best fit value , with the @xmath83 uncertainties quoted in the previous section ( i.e. above a 50% confidence level in a 2-d slice ) , our best values for @xmath7 are @xmath84 in the inner galaxy , and @xmath74 in the outer galaxy .    as an indication of the uncertainty level related to the use of eq .",
    "[ eq : firas ] , increasing the bolometric fluxes to @xmath85 results in @xmath86 for @xmath41 .",
    "only very low significance fits were found using either @xmath87 , or @xmath88 .",
    "a factor of 2 in the mass - luminosity relation @xmath89 gives @xmath90 , i.e. no significant change .",
    "a steep imf index seems to be a robust result of our analysis .",
    "the imf index @xmath7 for the inner and outer galaxy seems to be the same , although @xmath9 changes significantly . in other words , although the average mass of newly formed stars is the same inside and outside the solar circle , the average number of stars per star forming region and in a finite mass range is lower in the outer galaxy .",
    "the best fits of the parameter @xmath9 imply that the expectation value for the number of stars per msfr with @xmath13 , @xmath91 , decreases from 225 for @xmath92 to 120 for @xmath93 .",
    "the decrease in @xmath91 is not an effect related to the area covered by the 100@xmath30 m iras beam : due to the lower fir background towards the outer galaxy , the iras point sources are detected to greater distances than in the inner galaxy ( the average distance to iras / cs sources is 6.92kpc for the outer galaxy , and 5.32kpc in terms of the effective distances for the inner galaxy ) .",
    "is there a gradient in the imf index with galactocentric radius ? how does our value for the imf index compare with other estimates ?",
    "the gradient proposed by garmany et al .",
    "( 1982 ) has been re - interpreted as a result of contamination from field o stars ( massey et al .",
    "1995a ) , which seem to derive from a very steep imf .",
    "the values massey et al .",
    "( 1995b ) and massey ( 1998 ) quote for @xmath7 in the milky way and the magellanic clouds ob associations are @xmath94 and @xmath95 , which argues against a metallicity dependence of @xmath7 , at least over 10 - 120@xmath96 . but constraining the analysis to nearby ob associations gives steeper values , claudius & grosbl ( 1980 ) give @xmath97 over 2.2 - 10@xmath96 , and brown ( 1998 ) gives @xmath7=1.9 for the upper scorpius subgroup of sco ob2 , over 3 - 16@xmath96 .",
    "brown ( 1998 ) used hipparcos data to ascertain membership ( see dezeeuw et al . 1999 ) , which is crucial in the coeval approximation ; the very large ob associations in massey et al .",
    "probably have a complex star formation history .",
    "although massey et al . establish a good case for a universal massive star imf , the exact value of the imf index is still an open issue .",
    "our contribution to this debate is that there certainly are differences in the physical processes governing star formation in the outer spiral arms and the molecular ring . in our simple approach , and understanding that we restricted our study to regions of massive star formation embedded in dense molecular cores and with at least one uchii region",
    ", it seems that although the imf index is constant , the average number of stars born per region is lower outside the solar circle .",
    "we favour a rather steep imf index , close to the values from brown ( 1998 ) .",
    "uchii regions are fairly short lived in comparison with giant hii regions .",
    "wood & churchwell ( 1989a ) estimated the lifetimes of uchii regions by comparing the number of o stars in the solar neighbourhood ( conti et al .",
    "1983 ) and the number of iras point sources that match the iras colours of uchii regions .",
    "they conclude that 10% to 20% of an o star s main sequence lifetime is spent embedded in a molecular cloud , in the uchii phase .",
    "this fraction has been reevaluated to only 0.5% by ct96 , and our estimate is @xmath98 ( see below ) . under the assumption that the luminosity of a msfr is dominated by the most massive star , ct96 show that if there is a variation of uchii lifetime with stellar mass , it is not as significant as the uncertainties in the imf .",
    "the crossing time at 10  kms@xmath16 is 10@xmath99yrs for a typical uchii region ( i.e. g34.3 + 0.2 , which at a distance of 3.7kpc is about @xmath100 cm ) .",
    "thus the margin between the dynamical timescale and the time o stars spend in the embedded phase of @xmath101yrs is narrow , and can be affected by many parameters other than the mass of the most massive star , such as clumpiness of the molecular clouds and relative motions between the exciting star and the molecular clumps .",
    "it is unlikely that the lifetimes of uchii regions depend strongly on their stellar contents .    from our synthetic population of msfrs",
    ", we find that the average number of o stars per msfr , with luminosities in excess of @xmath102 ) , is 0.55 for @xmath92 and 0.29 for @xmath103 - we will consider 0.5 o stars per iras / cs source . within 2.5 kpc of the sun , conti et al .",
    "( 1983 ) report 436 o stars with @xmath104 .",

    "this would give 9.8 iras / cs sources within 2.5kpc of the sun .",
    "the average fraction of lifetime o stars spend in the embedded phase would thus be @xmath109 .",
    "this latter approach has the advantage of not suffering as much from the peculiar velocities of local sources . but some o stars in the transition between the embedded uchii phase and the field stars could have been missed by conti et al .",
    ". therefore we estimate that o stars spend @xmath98 of their lifetime in the embedded phase .",
    "we have constructed the fir luminosity function for iras point sources with colours of uchii regions and cs(21 ) detections , for different sectors in the galactic disk .",
    "the lfs are reliable above a luminosity of @xmath110 , and extend to @xmath111 in the high luminosity end , with a peak at @xmath112 .",
    "we analysed the trends in the lf of iras / cs sources in terms of an ensemble of massive star forming regions , and two free parameters suffice to provide a remarkably good fit to the shape of the lf .",

    "a power law distribution for the number of stars per msfr has an exponent @xmath119 in the inner galaxy .",

    "thus , the expectation value for the number of stars per msfr with @xmath121 decreases from 225 for @xmath92 to 120 for @xmath93 .    the results of our analysis show that the observed luminosity functions for uchii regions can be traced to the underlying young population .",

    "<S> the population of newly formed massive stars , while still embedded in their parent molecular clouds , is studied on the galactic disk scale . </S>",
    "<S> we analyse the luminosity function of iras point - like sources , with far - infrared ( fir ) colours of ultra - compact hii regions , that have been detected in the cs(21 ) line - a tracer of high density molecular gas . </S>",
    "<S> the fir luminosities of 555 massive star forming regions ( msfrs ) , 413 of which lie within the solar circle , are inferred from their fluxes in the four iras bands and from their kinematic distances , derived using the cs(21 ) velocity profiles . </S>",
    "<S> the luminosity function ( lf ) for the uchii region candidates shows a peak well above the completeness limit , and is different within and outside the solar circle ( 96% confidence level ) . </S>",
    "<S> while within the solar circle the lf has a maximum for @xmath0 , outside the solar circle the maximum is at @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we model the lf using three free parameters : @xmath2 , the exponent for the initial mass function ( imf ) expressed in @xmath3 ; @xmath4 , the exponent for a power law distribution in @xmath5 , the number of stars per msfr ; and @xmath6 , an upper limit for @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> while @xmath7 has a value of @xmath8 throughout the galaxy , @xmath9 changes from @xmath10 inside the solar circle to @xmath11 outside , with a maximum for the number of stars per msfr of @xmath12650 and @xmath12450 ( with @xmath13 ) . </S>",
    "<S> while the imf appears not to vary , the average number of stars per msfr within the solar circle is higher than for the outer galaxy . </S>"
