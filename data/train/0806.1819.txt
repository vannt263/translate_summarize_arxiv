    "multiple - input , multiple - output(mimo ) wireless transmission systems have been intensively studied during the last decade .",
    "the alamouti code @xcite for two transmit antennas is a novel scheme for mimo transmission , which , due to its orthogonality properties , allows a low complexity maximum - likelihood ( ml ) decoder .",
    "this scheme led to the generalization of stbcs from orthogonal designs @xcite .",
    "such codes allow the transmitted symbols to be decoupled from one another and single - symbol ml decoding is achieved over _ quasi static _ rayleigh fading channels . even though these codes achieve the maximum diversity gain for a given number of transmit and receive antennas and for any arbitrary complex constellations , unfortunately , these codes are not @xmath2 , where , by a @xmath2 code , we mean a code that transmits at a rate of @xmath3 complex symbols per channel use for an @xmath4 transmit antenna , @xmath5 receive antenna system .",
    "the golden code @xcite is a full - rate , full - diversity code and has a decoding complexity of the order of @xmath6 for arbitrary constellations of size @xmath7 the codes in @xcite and the trace - orthogonal cyclotomic code in @xcite also match the golden code . with reduction in the decoding complexity",
    "being the prime objective , two new full - rate , full - diversity codes have recently been discovered : the first code was independently discovered by hottinen , tirkkonen and wichman @xcite and by paredes , gershman and alkhansari @xcite , which we call the htw - pga code and the second , which we call the sezginer - sari code , was reported in @xcite by sezginer and sari . both these codes enable simplified decoding , achieving a complexity of the order of @xmath8 .",
    "the first code is also shown to have the non - vanishing determinant property @xcite .",
    "however , these two codes have lesser coding gain compared to the golden code .",
    "a detailed discussion of these codes has been made in @xcite , wherein a comparison of the codeword error rate ( cer ) performance reveals that the golden code has the best performance .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a new full - rate , full - diversity stbc for @xmath9 mimo transmission , which has low decoding complexity .",
    "the contributions of this paper may be summarized ( see table [ table1 ] also ) as follows :    * the proposed code has the same coding gain as that of the golden code ( and hence of that in @xcite and the trace - orthonormal cyclotomic code ) for any qam constellation ( by a qam constellation we mean any finite subset of the integer lattice ) and larger coding gain than those of the htw - pga code and the sezginer - sari code . *",
    "compared with the golden code and the codes in @xcite and @xcite , the proposed code has lesser decoding complexity for all complex constellations except for square qam constellations in which case the complexity is the same . compared to the htw - pga code and the sezginer - sari codes , the proposed code has the same decoding complexity for all non - rectangular qam [ fig [ fig2 ] ] constellations . *",
    "the proposed code has the non - vanishing determinant property for qam constellations and hence is diversity - multiplexing gain ( dmg ) tradeoff optimal .",
    "the remaining content of the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec2 ] , the system model and the code design criteria are reviewed along with some basic definitions .",
    "the proposed stbc is described in section [ sec3 ] and its non - vanishing determinant property is shown in section [ sec4 ] . in section [ sec5 ] the ml decoding complexity of the proposed code is discussed and the scheme to decode it using sphere decoding is discussed in section [ sec6 ] . in section [ sec7 ] ,",
    "simulation results are presented to show the performance of the proposed code as well as to compare with few other known codes . concluding remarks constitute section [ sec8 ] .",

    "for the @xmath9 mimo system , the target is to design a code that is full - rate , i.e transmits 2 complex symbols per channel use , has full - diversity , maximum coding gain and allows low ml decoding complexity .",
    "in this section , we present our stbc for @xmath1 mimo system .",
    "the design is based on the class of codes called co - ordinate interleaved orthogonal designs ( ciods ) , which was studied in @xcite in connection with the general class of single - symbol decodable codes and , specifically for 2 transmit antennas , is as follows .",

    "so if qam constellations are chosen , they have to be rotated .",

    "it has been shown in @xcite that holds only when @xmath118 , i.e. , only when @xmath119 .",
    "this means that the determinant of the codeword difference matrix is 0 only when the codeword difference matrix is itself 0 .",
