    "in 1931 dirac linked the existence of magnetic monopoles ( mms ) with the quantization of electric charge and postulated the relation between the elementary electric charge @xmath95 of the electron and a basic magnetic charge @xmath96 @xcite : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is an unknown integer and @xmath99 is the unit dirac magnetic charge ( in the cgs system ) .",
    "if free quarks exist , eq .  [ eq.dirac ] should be modified by replacing @xmath95 with @xmath100 , which effectively increases @xmath96 by a factor of 3 .",
    "there was no prediction for the monopole mass . a rough estimate , obtained assuming that the classical monopole radius is equal to the classical electron radius , yields @xmath101  gev / c@xmath6 .",
    "since 1931 , experimental searches for `` classical dirac '' monopoles have been performed at nearly every new high - energy accelerator , employing a variety of direct and indirect methods @xcite . by a classical ( dirac )",
    "monopole , we mean a particle without electric charge or hadronic interactions and with magnetic charge @xmath96 satisfying the dirac quantization condition ( eq .  [ eq.dirac ] ) .    within the framework of grand unified theories ( gut ) of the strong and electroweak interactions , supermassive magnetic monopoles with masses @xmath102gev / c@xmath6",
    "could have been produced in the early universe as intrinsically stable topological defects at a high energy phase transition that leaves an unbroken u(1 ) group @xcite . at the present time",
    ", such monopoles could exist in the penetrating cosmic radiation as `` fossil '' remnants of that transition .",
    "the detection of such particles would be one of the most spectacular confirmations of gut predictions .",
    "the most stringent upper limits on an isotropic flux of gut magnetic monopoles , assuming monopole masses @xmath103  gev / c@xmath6 , have been set by the macro experiment @xcite . in some grand unified theories values of the monopole mass as low as @xmath104  gev / c@xmath6",
    "are allowed @xcite .",
    "although it is not yet possible to set direct limits at this mass scale , it is worthwhile to search in the accessible region at lep energies .",
    "searches for classical point - like monopoles have been performed mainly at high - energy accelerators and in cosmic radiation experiments .",
    "monopole searches have predominantly used either ionization or induction detection techniques .",
    "induction experiments measure the monopole magnetic charge and are independent of monopole mass and velocity .",
    "these experiments search for the induction of a persistent current within a superconducting loop @xcite .",
    "searches for magnetic monopoles using this method have been performed at the p@xmath105 tevatron collider assuming that produced mms could stop , and be trapped and bound , in the matter surrounding the d0 and cdf collision regions @xcite . the same strategy has been used to search for magnetic monopoles produced in e@xmath106p collisions at hera @xcite .",
    "ionization experiments rely on the large magnetic charge of monopoles to produce more ionization than an electrical charge travelling with the same velocity . for @xmath107 and velocities @xmath108 a magnetic monopole behaves , in terms of ionization energy loss @xmath109 , like an equivalent electric charge with @xmath110 .",
    "the energy losses are thus very large @xmath111 and dirac magnetic monopoles would be easily distinguished from minimum ionizing electrically charged standard model ( sm ) particles @xcite .",
    "direct searches for magnetic monopoles using tracking devices were performed at p@xmath105 and @xmath0  colliders .",
    "experiments at the tevatron collider established cross section limits of about @xmath112  cm@xmath6 for mms with @xmath114  gev / c@xmath6 @xcite , while searches at lep have excluded masses up to 45  gev / c@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "indirect searches for classical monopoles have relied on the effects of virtual monopole / anti - monopole loops added to qed processes in p@xmath105 and @xmath0  collisions @xcite .",
    "since the standard model @xmath115boson could couple to monopoles , assuming that the coupling between the @xmath115  and a mm pair is larger than for any lepton pair , the measurement of the @xmath115  decay width provides an indirect limit on mm production for @xmath116 @xcite .",
    "this paper describes a direct search for mm pairs produced in @xmath117 reactions .",
    "the data were collected with the opal detector at the lep accelerator at cern .",
    "this search was primarily based on the @xmath118 measurements in the tracking chambers .",
    "opal has a well established analysis to search for stable , long - lived , massive particles using the @xmath3 signatures of individual charged particle tracks @xcite .",
    "this analysis technique could not be used here because mms are too heavily ionizing , resulting in charge saturation in the central jet chamber .",
    "therefore , a new analysis method was developed based on hit information rather than reconstructed tracks .",
    "the analysis was sensitive to mms with masses from 45  gev / c@xmath6 up to the kinematic limit ( about 103  gev / c@xmath6 ) .",
    "a description of the opal detector and its jet chamber can be found in reference @xcite .",
    "only a brief overview is given here .",
    "the opal detector operated at lep between 1989 and 2000 and is now dismantled .",
    "the central detector comprised a system of tracking chambers , providing track reconstruction over 96% of the full solid angle inside a 0.435  t uniform magnetic field parallel to the beam axis .",
    "it consisted of a two - layer silicon microstrip vertex detector , a high - precision vertex drift chamber with axial and stereo wires , a large - volume jet chamber and a set of @xmath119-chambers measuring the track coordinates along the beam direction .",
    "the jet chamber ( cj ) @xcite is the most important detector for this analysis .",
    "the chamber , with a diameter of about 2 m and a length of about 4 m , was divided into 24 azimuthal sectors , each equipped with 159 sense wires . up",
    "to 159 position and @xmath3 measurements per track were thus possible .",
    "the cj also provided the hardware trigger for monopole candidates .",
    "this trigger identified events with highly ionizing particles .",
    "of the 159 sense wires of a sector , 36 wires were combined to define three groups with 12 wires each .",
    "one group was at an inner region , close to the @xmath0collision axis .",
    "the other two groups were at central and outer regions .",
    "for each wire , hits from highly ionizing tracks were identified as those yielding an integrated signal above a threshold of 1250 counts in the flash analogues to digital converters ( fadc ) . for comparison , a minimum ionizing particle yields about 200 fadc counts .",
    "values slightly above 1000 fadc counts are typical for protons with a momentum of a few hundred mev . if , within a group , more than 10 wires detected a high de / dx hit , a decision bit was set .",
    "if this bit was set by all groups of a sector , the monopole trigger was fired .",
    "using raw hit information of randomly triggered events , the monopole trigger was determined to have an efficiency greater than 99% .",
    "a lead - glass electromagnetic calorimeter located outside the magnet coil covered the full azimuthal range with good hermeticity in the polar angle range of @xmath120 .",
    "the magnet return yoke was instrumented for hadron calorimetry covering the region @xmath121 and was surrounded by four layers of muon chambers .",
    "electromagnetic calorimeters close to the beam axis completed the geometrical acceptance down to 24 mrad on each side of the interaction point .",
    "these small - angle calorimeters were also used to measure the integrated luminosity by counting bhabha events @xcite .    in order to trigger on the signal described in the introduction , only data collected when the monopole trigger was active were used .",
    "the data - set analysed here was recorded during the lep2 phase with an average centre - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "energy of 206.3  gev , and corresponded to a total integrated luminosity of 62.7  pb@xmath1 .",
    "the signal reaction @xmath122 was simulated at @xmath123  =  208  gev for monopole masses ( @xmath124 ) of 45 , 50 , 55 , 60 , 65 , 70 , 75 , 80 , 85 , 90 , 95 , 100 , 101 , 102 , 103 and 104  gev / c@xmath6 with monte carlo ( mc ) event samples .",
    "each sample contained 1000 events .",
    "small differences in the centre - of - mass energies between the opal data analysed ( @xmath125=  203.6  gev , @xmath126=  207.0  gev , for an average @xmath127=  206.3  gev ) and the signal mc samples ( @xmath123 ) have a negligible effect on the analysis .",
    "mm masses were scaled to the c.m .",
    "energy with the equation : @xmath128 this scaling is valid since @xmath3 ( hence detection efficiency ) is a linear function of mass .",
    "the very large value of the magnetic charge makes it impossible to use perturbative theory to calculate the mm production process .",
    "mms were assumed to be spin 1/2 particles , produced from the @xmath0 initial state via annihilation into a virtual photon , which yields a monopole - antimonopole pair with a uniform azimuthal distribution and with the typical fermion polar angle distribution @xmath129 : @xmath130 since magnetic charge can not be simulated directly , mms were simulated as heavy electrically charged fermions with an effective charge of @xmath131 ( assuming @xmath132 ) .",
    "the specific ionization energy loss was computed according to eq .",
    "[ eq.dedx ] .",
    "a magnetic monopole interacts with a magnetic field analogously to how an electron interacts with an electric field .",
    "the lorentz force for a magnetic monopole carrying magnetic charge @xmath96 is : @xmath133    the geant3 @xcite based opal detector simulation program @xcite was used to simulate the behavior of the mms in the opal detector .",
    "the routines to transport the particles through the magnetic field were modified such that over a given step the change in the momentum @xmath134 of the monopole was obtained by solving analytically the differential equation : @xmath135    the solution describes the motion of a magnetic monopole in a uniform magnetic field .",
    "the trajectory is a parabola , accelerating in the direction of the magnetic field . in the plane",
    "perpendicular to the magnetic field the motion is along a straight line , in sharp contrast to electrically charged particles , which curve in this plane .",
    "we studied the effects of multiple scattering of the monopoles and the modelling of the electric field between the anode , cathode , and potential wires in cj and found them to be negligible .",
    "a software emulation of the monopole trigger was used to study its efficiency . for the simulated monopole events ,",
    "the trigger efficiency was found to be essentially 100% .",
    "the background was estimated using mc simulations of standard model processes , generated at @xmath2=206  gev .",
    "two - fermion events ( @xmath136 with @xmath137 = @xmath138 ) were simulated with kk2f @xcite .",
    "for the two - photon background , the pythia @xcite and phojet @xcite monte carlo generators were used for @xmath139 final states and the vermaseren @xcite and bdk @xcite generators for all @xmath140 final states .",
    "four - fermion final states were simulated with grc4f @xcite , which takes into account interference between all diagrams .    all generated signal and background events were processed through the full simulation of the opal detector .",
    "the same event analysis chain was applied to the simulated events and to the data .",

    "energy of @xmath142  gev is shown as a function of the monopole mass .",
    "the average upper limit on the cross - section , computed using a frequentist approach , is 0.05  pb in the mass range @xmath143  gev / c@xmath6 .",
    "this limit is essentially independent of the mass in this range .",
    "the computation of the cross - section is non - trivial .",
    "nevertheless we expect the cross - section to be large .",
    "the cross - section for the pair production of dirac magnetic monopoles computed assuming a naive tree - level coupling through an s - channel virtual photon , according to the effective charge @xmath144 , is around 5 orders of magnitude larger than the upper limit obtained in this experiment @xcite . in this model we can thus exclude classical mms in the mass range 45 - 102 gev / c@xmath6 .",
    "this is a new excluded mass range for dirac magnetic monopole searches in @xmath0  interactions .",
