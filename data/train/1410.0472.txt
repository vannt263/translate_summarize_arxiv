    "our tuneable gate can be interpreted as a generalized instance of cluster state reshaping , which we name cluster gain tuning .",

    "more generally , any physical graph state can be described by complex weights and a complex adjacency matrix ( including self - loops ) , corresponding to a set of non - hermitian nullifiers , where the eigenvalue ( nullifier ) conditions are still exactly fulfilled even for finite squeezing @xcite .",
