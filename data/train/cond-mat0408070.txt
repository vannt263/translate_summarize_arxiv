    "the study of nonequilibrium statistical models is a subject of current interest in a broad range of fields such as chemical reactions , fluid turbulence , chaos , biological populations , growth - deposition processes , and even economics @xcite . in particular , the study of surface reaction systems has received a great deal of attention @xcite .",
    "these systems not only constitute a fruitful laboratory for exploring critical phenomena associated with out - of - equilibrium statistical physics , but they can also play an important role in the development of more efficient catalytic processes .",
    "catalytic reactions are widespread in nature and have many industrial and technological applications @xcite .",
    "several experiments show that it is possible to increase the efficiency of catalytic reactions by subjecting the system to periodic external forcing @xcite .",
    "monte carlo simulations of the ziff , gulari , and barshad ( zgb ) model without desorption @xcite indicate that an enhancement of the catalytic activity is observed when the system is perturbed by a periodic force that drives it briefly into the co poisoned state @xcite .",
    "however , it is well known that the zgb model does not reproduce several important aspects of catalytic processes , such as lateral diffusion @xcite and co desorption @xcite . in the present study we neglect diffusion and concentrate on the effects of co desorption . for brevity we will refer to this model as the zgb - k model @xcite",
    ".    other work by the present authors @xcite indicates that near the coexistence line between the active and the co poisoned regime , the decay times of the metastable states are different if the zgb - k model is driven into the co poisoned state from the active phase , or if it is driven into the active phase from the co poisoned state .",
    "based on this result , we expect that the catalytic activity of the system will increase when the system is subjected to periodic variation of the external co pressure , only when one takes into account that the time it takes the system to decontaminate is different from the time it takes it to contaminate .",
    "furthermore , we show that the zgb - k model , driven by an oscillating co pressure , undergoes a dynamic phase transition , similar to the one observed in ising @xcite , anisotropic heisenberg @xcite , and @xmath3 models @xcite , driven by an oscillating applied field .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we define the model and describe the monte carlo simulation techniques used . in sec .",
    "iii we present and discuss the numerical results obtained when subjecting the model to a periodic variation of the external co pressure .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions in sec .  iv .",

    "co+o @xmath4 co@xmath0 on a catalytic surface in terms of a single parameter : the probability @xmath5 that the next molecule arriving at the surface is co. this parameter is proportional to the partial pressure of co and will loosely be referred to as the co pressure .",
    "the model exhibits two transitions , a continuous one at low co pressure to an oxygen - saturated surface , and a discontinuous one at a higher co pressure to a co saturated surface .",
    "when desorption is included , the distinction between the high and low co coverage phases disappears for a desorption rate @xmath6 above a critical value , @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "there is evidence that the nonequilibrium phase transition at @xmath8 is in the same universality class as the two - dimensional kinetic ising model at equilibrium @xcite .",
    "below @xmath8 there are well - defined low and high coverage phases , separated by a discontinuous , nonequilibrium phase transition .",
    "this picture is consistent with experimental observations on catalytic surfaces that show transitions between low and high coverage phases  @xcite .",
    "the zgb model with co desorption is simulated on a square lattice of side @xmath9 that represents the catalytic surface .",
    "a monte carlo simulation generates a sequence of trials : adsorption with probability @xmath10 and desorption with probability @xmath6 .",
    "a site is selected at random . in desorption , if the site is occupied by a co it is vacated , if not the trial ends . in adsorption , if the site is occupied the trial ends , if not a co or o@xmath0 molecule is selected with probability @xmath5 or @xmath11 ( the relative impingement rates of co and o@xmath0 ) , respectively .",
    "a co molecule can be adsorbed at the empty site if none of its nearest neighbors are occupied by an o atom .",
    "otherwise , one of the occupied neighbors is selected at random and removed from the surface , liberating a co@xmath0 molecule .",
    "o@xmath0 molecules require a nearest - neighbor pair of vacant sites to adsorb .",
    "once an o@xmath0 molecule is adsorbed , it dissociates into two o atoms .",
    "if an o atom is located next to a site filled with a co molecule , they react to form a co@xmath0 molecule that escapes , leaving two sites vacant .",
    "this process mimics the co + o @xmath4 co@xmath0 surface reaction .",
    "our simulations were performed on a square lattice of @xmath12 sites , assuming periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the time unit is one monte carlo step per site ( mcss ) , in which each site is visited once , on average .",
    "the coverages @xmath13 and @xmath14 are defined as the fraction of surface sites occupied by co and o , respectively , and @xmath15 is defined as the rate of production of co@xmath16 . in fig .",

    "one way to perturb the catalytic oxidation process in order to increase the co@xmath0 production is by switching the external pressure back and forth across the discontinuous transition @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that when the zgb system without desorption is quickly oscillated between the low and high @xmath13 phases by a periodic variation of the external pressure , there is considerable enhancement of the catalytic activity @xcite .",
    "the period and amplitude of the driving pressure must be calibrated very carefully in order to avoid driving the system irreversibly toward the co poisoned state .    in other work",
    "@xcite we have calculated the lifetimes associated with the decay of the metastable states of the zgb - k model .",
    "the system was prepared in the low ( high ) co coverage phase with an initial pressure @xmath29 ( @xmath30 , and then @xmath5 was suddenly changed to @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) .",

    "we found that the lifetimes depend on the direction of the process , the decontamination time @xmath33 ( from high to low co coverage ) being different from the poisoning time @xmath34 ( from low to high co coverage ) .",
    "inspired by this result , we decided to subject the system to an oscillating pressure @xmath35 that in a period @xmath36 takes the values , @xmath37 located at both sides of the transition point , i.e. , @xmath38 ( see fig .  [ serie_osc](a ) ) .",

    "these values are close to those of the two - dimensional ising universality class , and together with general symmetry arguments @xcite they represent reasonable evidence that this far - from equilibrium phase transition belongs to the same universality class as the equilibrium ising model .",
    "a a higher level of confidence about the universality class would require simulations at least an order of magnitude more extensive than the ones presented here  a task beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "finally , we note that the enhancement of the co@xmath0 production and the continuous dpt are probably closely related phenomena since the critical cluster associated with the phase transition is likely to provide more empty sites available for o@xmath0 adsorption near adsorbed co molecules , than the sharp interfaces expected near the first - order coexistence line seen under constant-@xmath5 conditions .",
