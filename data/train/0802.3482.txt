    "in the past decade , over 270 extrasolar planets have been discovered in a plethora of diverse environments .",
    "earth - like planets in habitable - zone orbits , however , remain well below the threshold of detection . a good representation of the doppler velocity state - of - the - art is presented by the triple planet system orbiting hd 69830 .",
    "this system has been shown to contain three neptune - mass planets , including one on a 197-day orbit , all revealed after only 74 radial velocity observations with residual noise of 0.6 ms@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the detection of the hd 69830 system suggests that focused efforts on selected stars may be able to probe down to the characterization of planets with radial velocity half - amplitudes considerably below 1 ms@xmath3 .",
    "targeted planet search around nearby stars may prove to be an efficient and inexpensive path to detection .",
    "simulations of transiting terrestrial planets around low - mass stars show that a space - based search can unveil these planets within a year @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "our goal is to argue that the @xmath0 centauri system provides a remarkable test - bed for pushing the doppler detection envelope .",
    "the @xmath0 centauri system , with @xmath4=1.33 pc , is the sun s closest neighbor .",
    "it is a triple star system composed of the central @xmath0 cen ab binary and the m dwarf proxima cen , which orbits the ab pair with a semi - major axis of over 10,000 au @xcite .",
    "the g2v star @xmath0 cen a and the k1v @xmath0 cen b have masses similar to the sun with @xmath5 and @xmath6 while the m dwarf proxima cen is significantly smaller with @xmath7 @xcite . though both a and b have super - solar metallicities @xmath8_a = 0.22 \\pm 0.02 $ ] and @xmath8_b = 0.26 \\pm 0.04 $ ] @xcite , no planets with masses comparable to neptune or larger have yet been found orbiting either star .",
    "astronomical observations of @xmath0 cen a and b have been conducted for over 150 years .",
    "astrometric observations date back to the first half of the nineteenth century , and the radial velocities of both components have been tabulated since 1904 . @xcite",
    "simultaneously fit all the published astrometric measurements and radial velocities of both components to constrain the binary orbital parameters .",
    "( see their reference list for an historical listing of publications relating to observations of @xmath0 cen a and b. ) a similar study had been done by @xcite . in the earlier study , after fitting for the binary orbit , they examined the plausibility of planetary companions and found that they could have detected a planetary companion with a mass above 10 @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite performed a similar , but more sensitive analysis , using the orbit of @xcite and their own high precision eso coud echelle spectrometer radial velocities .",
    "they found upper limits for planets on circular orbits at any orbital radius around each component of 2.5 @xmath9 for @xmath0 cen a and 3.5 @xmath9 for @xmath0 cen b. we performed a procedure in which we used the parameters from @xcite and their radial velocities and those from @xcite for @xmath0 cen b. we used the systemic console ( rivera et al .",
    "2008 in prep . ) , to fit only the mean anomaly and the velocity offsets between the three data sets .",
    "the remaining parameters were held fixed .",
    "if we simply assume that the rms of the fit , 9 ms@xmath3 , corresponds to the upper limit of the radial velocity half amplitude of a planet in a circular orbit at 1 au or at 3 au , then the corresponding upper limit on the mass of the planet is @xmath100.3 @xmath9 or @xmath100.5 @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "this also follows from the formula for the radial velocity half amplitude @xmath11 of a planet of mass @xmath12 , period @xmath13 , and eccentricity @xmath14 orbiting a star of mass @xmath15 with orbital inclination relative to the plane of the sky @xmath16 , @xmath17 where for the last relation , kepler s third law is applied , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and the units for @xmath12 , @xmath15 , and @xmath20 are in @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and au , respectively .",
    "several studies of @xmath0 cen a and b show that terrestrial planet formation is possible around both stars despite their strong binary interaction @xcite . results to date consistently indicate that planetary systems with one or more earth - mass planets can form within 2.5 au from the host stars and remain stable for gigayear scales .",
    "numerical simulations and stability analyzes of planetesimal disks indicate that material is stable within 3 au from a / b , as long as the inclination of the disk with respect to the binary is @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "in essence , with regard to the formation process , the companion star plays the perturbative role that the gas giants in our solar system are believed to have played during the formation phases of the sun s terrestrial planets .",
    "the perturbations allow for the accretion of a large number of planetary embryos into a final configuration containing 3 - 4 bodies @xcite .",
    "circumprimary planet formation is known to occur in binary systems and despite observational selection biases , @xmath24 of all planets discovered to date belong to multiple systems @xcite . of the binaries that are known to harbor planets ,",
    "three ( hd 41004 , @xmath25 cephei , and gl86 ) have projected semi - major axes of @xmath26 20 au , an orbital separation similar to that of the ab pair .    in this paper",
    "we assess the detectability of terrestrial planets around @xmath0 cen b. we begin by carrying out eight simulations of the late stage of planet formation using the initial conditions detailed in   [ ics ] . a brief description of the systems we formed is given in   [ formation ] .",
    "each planetary system is then tested for detectability using a monte carlo method for generating synthetic radial velocity observations , as described in   [ detection ] . based on our results",
    ", we are able to accurately evaluate the detectability of planetary systems around the star . finally , in   [ discussion ] we summarize our work and discuss our results .",
    "the initial conditions of the circumstellar disk in our simulations mimic conditions at the onset of the chaotic growth phase of terrestrial planet formation @xcite in which collisions of isolated embryos , protoplanets of approximately lunar mass , dominate the evolution of the disk . during this phase ,",
    "gravitational interactions among planetary embryos serve to form the final planetary system around the star and clear out the remaining material in the disk . at the start of this phase , several hundred protoplanets orbit the star on nearly circular orbits .",
    "we model the @xmath0 centauri b circumstellar disk with a @xmath27 surface density profile where @xmath28 g @xmath29 as calculated from the total mass @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the number of protoplanetary embryos in the disk and @xmath32 is the embryo s mass .",
    "these surface densities are based on disks modeled by @xcite and account for the enhanced metallicity of @xmath0 cen b with respect to the sun .",
    "the disk extends from @xmath33 au and it is coplanar with the binary orbit . for each run",
    ", we populate the disk with @xmath34 to @xmath35 embryos of lunar mass ( @xmath36 ) with semi - major axes chosen via a rejection method in @xmath20 to obtain a @xmath37 density profile .",
    "initial orbital elements of each embryo are randomly generated with mean anomalies , arguments of pericenter , and longitudes of ascending node extending from 0@xmath38 to 360@xmath38 , eccentricities in the range @xmath39 , and inclinations in the range @xmath40 with respect to the plane of the binary .",
    "integrations are run using a specialized version of the symplectic hybrid integrator in the mercury integration package @xcite .",
    "this @xmath31-body code is designed to study planet growth in the presence of a binary companion @xcite .",
    "bodies grow via accretion through perfectly inelastic embryo - embryo collisions , and therefore close encounters are integrated directly rather than symplecticaly .",
    "each simulation was evolved for 200 myr , consuming a total of @xmath10600 cpu hours on several ( dual ) intel xeon machines with clock speeds of at least 2.2 ghz .",
    "we focus on terrestrial planet formation around @xmath0 cen b , for which we perform a total of eight integrations named rn_n , where n is the initial number of protoplanets and",
    "n is an identifier .",
    "for instance , r700_2 corresponds to our second simulation of a disk initially containing 700 bodies . as shown in @xcite and @xcite , planet formation around @xmath0",
    "cen a is expected to be qualitatively similar .",
    "our _ n_-body simulations take place in the wide binary regime , with @xmath0 cen b as the central star and @xmath0 cen a orbiting with binary semi - major axis @xmath41 au and eccentricity @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "we adopt the stellar masses to be @xmath43 and @xmath44 @xcite and radii @xmath45 and @xmath46 @xcite . due to its low mass and large distance from the ab pair ,",
    "proxima cen is neglected in our simulations .",
    "figure 1 shows the late evolutionary stage of a protoplanetary disk initially containing 600 moon - mass embryos ( r600_1 , see figure 2 and table 1 ) .",
    "the radius of each circle is proportional to the radius of the object .",
    "bodies in the outer parts of the disk ( @xmath47 au ) are immediately launched into highly eccentric orbits and either migrate inward to be accreted by inner bodies , collide with the central star , or are ejected from the system ( @xmath48 au ) . in this simulation , @xmath49 of the total initial mass is cleared within the first 70 myr . by the end of simulation r600_1 , four planets have formed .",
    "one planet has approximately the mass of mercury and is located at @xmath50 au , two 0.6 @xmath51 planets form at @xmath52 and @xmath53 au , and a 1.8 @xmath51 planet forms at @xmath54 au .",
    "table 1 shows the orbital elements of the final systems that emerge from the calculations .",
    "all of our simulations result in the formation of 1 - 4 planets with semi - major axes in the range @xmath55 au , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "we find that 42 % of all planets formed with masses in the range 1 - 2 @xmath51 reside in the star s habitable zone ( fig .",
    "2 ) , taken to be @xmath56 @xcite .    as a general trend",
    ", we find that disks with higher initial surface densities are able to retain more mass ( see figure 3 ) but do not necessarily form more planets ( see table 1 ) .",
    "all of our disks form systems with one or two planets in the 1 - 2 @xmath51 mass range .",
    "the radial velocity detection of earth - mass planets near the habitable zones of solar type stars requires cms@xmath3 precision .",
    "@xmath0 cen b is overwhelmingly the best star in the sky for which one can contemplate mounting a high - cadence search .",
    "both @xmath0 cen a and b have relatively high metallicities , with @xmath8_a=0.22 $ ] for a and @xmath8_b=0.26 $ ] for b @xcite and therefore would have been presumably endowed with circumprimary disks containing a relatively high fraction of solid material .",
    "simulations such as the ones we have performed and others indicate that the final mass present in terrestrial planets is in direct proportion to the initial amount of material available .",
    "@xmath0 cen b is exceptionally quiet , both in terms of acoustic p - wave mode oscillations and chromospheric activity .",
    "observations of @xmath0 cen a with the uves echelle spectrograph show that the star exhibits p - mode oscillations with amplitude varying from 1 - 3 ms@xmath3 and a periodicity of @xmath105 minutes @xcite .",
    "uves observations of @xmath0 cen b show that peak amplitude noise for this star is much lower , reaching only 0.08 ms@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the average noise lies in the frequency range 7.5 - 15 mhz for @xmath0 cen a and 4.1 mhz for @xmath0 cen b. these frequencies are far higher than the @xmath57 to @xmath58 mhz frequency range associated with the periods of the putative terrestrial planets . a focused high cadence approach involving year - round , all - night observations would effectively average out the star s p - mode oscillations .",
    "the long and short term chromospheric variability of the @xmath0 cen system was studied by @xcite using x - ray data taken with xmm - newton over a period of two years .",
    "they find that @xmath0 cen a s x - ray luminosity declined by a factor of ten in this time period , an indication of a moderate coronal activity . in turn ,",
    "@xmath0 cen b s x - ray brightness varied only within a factor of two , denoting rather low short - term chromospheric activity associated with weak stellar flares . to date , no long - term variability has been detected in either star .",
    "@xmath0 cen b is remarkably similar in age , mass , and spectral type to hd 69830 , the nearby k0 dwarf known to host three neptune - mass planets @xcite .",
    "both @xmath0 cen b and hd 69830 are slightly less massive than the sun with masses 0.91 @xmath22 and 0.86 @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "their estimated ages are 5.6 - 5.9 gyr for @xmath0 cen b @xcite and 4 - 10 gyr for hd 69830 .",
    "both stars are slightly cooler than the sun : @xmath0 cen b is a k1v with @xmath59 k , while hd 69830 is a type k0v star with @xmath60 k. the stars have also similar visual absolute magnitudes , @xmath61 = 5.8 for @xmath0 cen b and @xmath61 = 5.7 for hd 69830 @xcite ; however , due to its proximity to us , the former star appears much brighter ( @xmath62 ) , allowing for exposures that are @xmath1060 times shorter .",
    "one can thus use a far smaller - aperture telescope , or alternatively , entertain a far higher observational cadence .",
    "indeed , @xmath0 cen b is so bright that the ccd readout will be the primary limiter to an observational strategy .",
    "furthermore , immediate proximity to @xmath0 cen a provides the opportunity to create a parallel set of observations for both stars .",
    "periodicities common to both stars would be indicative of erroneous signals being introduced by the observational pipeline itself .",
    "an advantage of @xmath0 cen b over hd 69830 is its increased metallicity ( [ fe / h ] = 0.26 vs. [ fe / h ] = -0.05 ) .",
    "higher metallicity leads to deeper lines , which can improve the precision of doppler velocities .",
    "oscillatory p - mode noise for hd 69830 was estimated to lie between 0.2 and 0.8 ms@xmath3 @xcite , reaching the upper limit of the p - mode noise expected for @xmath0 cen b.    because @xmath0 cen b is sightly less massive than the sun , terrestrial planets would induce a larger radial velocity half - amplitude ( earth induces a 9 cms@xmath3 reflex velocity on the sun ) . also , @xmath0 cen b is significantly less luminous than the sun and thus its habitable zone is closer in @xcite .",
    "yet another advantage is the fact that planets should be close to circumplanar with the binary plane , which is inclined only @xmath63 to the line of sight to earth .",
    "this ensures that @xmath64 , and that the planets will contribute nearly their full mass to the observed radial velocity half - amplitude .",
    "finally , the system is perfectly positioned in the southern sky .",
    "@xmath0 centauri lies at @xmath65 declination , allowing for observations nearly 300 days out of the year at the latitude of the las campanas observatory or the cerro tololo international observatory in chile .",
    "all these criteria make @xmath0 cen b the ideal host and candidate for the detection of a planetary system that contains one or more terrestrial planets .",
    "we took the orbital elements of the systems emerging from our simulations and generated model radial velocities .",
    "we developed a code which effectively simulates the observing conditions for any specific location on earth .",
    "given the latitude and longitude of an observatory and the ra and dec of an object , the code determines when the object is observable .",
    "two additional inputs concern the beginning and end of an observing night : the angle of the sun below the local horizon and the maximum airmass of the object , beyond which observing should not continue .",
    "some fraction of nights are lost to emulate adverse weather conditions and other effects which could result in missed observations .",
    "for this paper we assumed a 25% probability for the loss of a night .",
    "we assumed access to a dedicated telescope at las campanas observatory . at this location",
    ", @xmath0 centauri is observable for about 10 months out of the year .",
    "we assumed an observing cadence of one exposure every 200 seconds , corresponding to the read out time of the detector ( this is a conservative estimate , since in practice we would expect a considerably higher duty cycle ) .",
    "finally , we assumed various values of gaussian white noise to add to the model radial velocities .",
    "figure 4 shows a simulated set of radial velocities for the system represented in run r600_1 . in this case",
    ", we assumed gaussian white noise with amplitude 3 ms@xmath3 .",
    "it is important to note that the model radial velocity for @xmath0 cen b due to the four terrestrial planets in this system has an amplitude of 23 cms@xmath3 , or a factor of 13 below the noise . over the five year span",
    ", 97,260 measurements can be obtained .",
    "for this example , we find that we can confidently detect 2 or 3 planets in this time span .",
    "most of the currently known extrasolar planets were announced after the false alarm probability ( fap ) for seeing a peak in the periodogram of the radial velocity data fell below @xmath101% .",
    "many were announced after the fap fell below this level and additional ( and sometimes extensive ) statistical tests of significance were performed . using the 1% fap as an initial indicator of the significance of a detection for the example discussed here , we can confidently detect at least one of the planets after about the first three years of observations .    in the absence of significant coloration to noise , the example shown in figures 4 and 5 is a pessimistic case . in keeping with the fact that the star is a virtual twin of hd 69830 @xcite ,",
    "@xmath0 cen b is expected to show very little radial velocity noise or jitter .",
    "the detection of three neptune mass planets around hd 69830 was facilitated by the small instrumental uncertainties for its radial velocity observations , with a median value of @xmath660.7 ms@xmath3 , along with the assumption of a very small long - term stellar jitter . for the example shown in figures 4 and 5 , and assuming an optimistic level of gaussian noise with amplitude @xmath660.7 ms@xmath3 , the largest peaks in the periodograms in figure 5 would have power of order 10 times greater .",
    "additionally , those peaks would have significantly smaller fap s , and these fap s would clearly reach the 1% level in less time than in the case with a larger amount of noise .",
    "thus , at least the first planet would have been clearly detected within the first two years , and at least 3 of the planets would have been detected after five years .",
    "assuming that 3 ms@xmath3 gaussian white noise is an upper limit to the level of radial velocity noise expected for @xmath0 cen b , and that small terrestrial planets ( @xmath67 ) orbit this star within 3 au , high cadence , relatively moderate term radial velocity observations should clearly detect at least one of these planets .",
    "our simulations and those of @xcite show that for disks with small inclinations relative to the binary orbit , large terrestrial planets tend to form in or near the habitable zone of @xmath0 cen b. thus , it is possible we may detect a habitable terrestrial planet around at least one of our nearest stellar neighbors .",
    "this is true for all the models explored and for an assumed gaussian white noise source with amplitude up to 3 ms@xmath3 , which is likely much larger than the expected jitter for @xmath0 cen b.",
    "the space density of binary systems containing roughly solar - mass components is roughly @xmath68 pc@xmath69 .",
    "we are thus remarkably lucky that the @xmath0 cen system is currently only 1.33 pc away .",
    "the possibility that detectable terrestrial planets are orbiting @xmath0 cen b does much to fire the imagination , and indeed , a positive identification of such a planet would be a truly landmark discovery .",
    "@xmath0 cen s proximity allows one to envision space - based follow - up efforts ( astrometric , coronographic , interferometric ) to characterize the planets that would be far more difficult to carry out for planets orbiting less luminous and more distant stars .",
    "alternately , or to phrase the situation another way , our current understanding of the process of terrestrial planet formation strongly suggests that _ both _ components of the @xmath0 cen system should have terrestrial planets .",
    "a lack of planets orbiting these stars would thus provide a critical hint that there is a significant qualitative gap in our understanding of planet formation .",
    "the situation is thus as follows .",
    "a successful detection of terrestrial planets orbiting @xmath0 cen b can be made within a few years and with the modest investment of resources required to mount a dedicated radial - velocity campaign with a 1-meter class telescope and high - resolution spectrograph .",
    "the plan requires three things to go right .",
    "first , the terrestrial planets need to have formed , and they need to have maintained dynamical stability over the past 5 gyr .",
    "second , the radial velocity technique needs to be pushed ( via unprecedentedly high cadence ) to a degree where planets inducing radial velocity half - amplitudes of order cms@xmath3 can be discerned .",
    "third , the parent star must have a negligible degree of red noise on the ultra - low frequency range occupied by the terrestrial planets .    in this paper",
    ", we ve made the case that conditions 1 and 2 are highly likely to have been met . in our view",
    ", the intrinsic noise spectrum of @xmath0 centauri b is likely all that stands between the present day and the imminent detection of extremely nearby , potentially habitable planets . because whole - sun measurements of the solar noise are intrinsically difficult to obtain , our best opportunity to measure microvariability in radial velocities is to do the @xmath0 cen ab doppler experiment .",
    "the intrinsic luminosity of the stars , their sky location , and their close pairing will allow for a definitive test of the limits of the radial velocity technique .",
    "if these limits can be pushed down to the cms@xmath3 level , then the prize , and the implications , may be very great indeed .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for providing useful comments that improved our paper .",

    "<S> all simulations lead to the formation of multiple - planet systems with at least one planet in the 1 - 2 m@xmath2 mass range at 0.5 - 1.5 au . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the detectability of our simulated planetary systems by generating synthetic radial velocity observations including noise based on the radial velocity residuals to the recently published three planet fit to the nearby k0 star hd 69830 . using these synthetic observations </S>",
    "<S> , we find that we can reliably detect a 1.8 m@xmath2 planet in the habitable zone of @xmath0 centauri b after only three years of high cadence observations . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the planet is detectable even if the radial velocity precision is 3 ms@xmath3 , as long as the noise spectrum is white . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the greatest uncertainty in our ability to detect rocky planets in the @xmath0 centauri system is the unknown magnitude of ultra - low frequency stellar noise . </S>"
