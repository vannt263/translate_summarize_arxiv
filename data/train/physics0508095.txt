    "the most common approach to improve overlap in free energy calculations ( used in thermodynamic integration , and free energy perturbation ) is to simulate the system at multiple hybrid , or intermediate stages ( e.g. , refs .  ) .",

    ", we address the overlap problem by calculating the absolute free energy for each of the end states , thus avoiding the need for any configurational overlap .",
    "our method relies on the calculation of the free energy difference between a reference system ( where the exact free energy can be calculated , either analytically or numerically ) and the system of interest .",
    "such use of a reference system with a computable free energy has been used successfully in solids where the reference system is generally a harmonic or einstein solid , @xcite and liquid systems , where the reference system is usually an ideal gas .",

    "@xcite the mining minima method can , in principle , include potential correlations between the torsions and bond angles or lengths , and uses an approximate method to compute local partition functions .",
    "other investigators have estimated absolute free energies for molecules using harmonic or quasi - harmonic approximations , @xcite however , as discussed in refs .   and local minima can be deviate substantially from a parabolic shape .",

    "greatly enhances the accuracy of the method since internal coordinates are tailored to the description of conformations .",
    "further , _ all degrees of freedom and their correlations _ are explicitly included in the method .",
    "our method differs in several ways from the important study of stoessel and nowak : @xcite ( i ) we use internal coordinates for molecules which are key for optimizing the overlap between the reference system and the system of interest ; ( ii ) we may use a nearly arbitrary reference potential because only a numerical reference free energy value is needed , not an analytic value ; ( iii ) there is no need , in cases we have studied , to use multi - stage methodology to find the desired free energy due to the overlap built into the reference system ,    we consider this report a `` proof of principle '' for our reference system method . after introducing the method ,",

    "may also be used .      the method used in this report relies on simple histograms for all degrees of freedom ( in principle , with internal or cartesian coordinates ) based on a `` physical ensemble '' of conformations generated via molecular dynamics , monte carlo or other canonical simulation .",

    "[ sec - method ] .",
    "we emphasize that an analytical solution need not be available ; a precise numerical evaluation is more than adequate .",
    "a well - sampled ensemble of reference system configurations is then readily generated and used to compute the free energy difference via eq .",
    "( [ eq - fep ] ) .",
    "the first step in our approach to constructing the reference system is to generate a physical ensemble ( i.e. , a trajectory ) by simulating the system of interest using standard molecular dynamics , monte carlo , or other canonical sampling techniques .",
    "the trajectory produced by the simulation is used to generate histograms for all coordinates as described below . in creating histograms , note that constrained coordinates , such as bond lengths involving hydrogens constrained by rattle , @xcite need not be binned since these coordinates do not change between configurations .",
    "such coordinate constraints are not required in the method , however .",

    "thus , when using internal coordinates , the simplest strategy to account for the jacobian is to bin according to a set of rules : bond lengths are binned according to @xmath48 , bond angles are binned according to @xmath49 , and dihedrals are binned according to @xmath46 ( i.e. , the same as cartesian coordinates ) .      once the histograms are constructed and populated using the physical ensemble , the reference ensemble is generated . to generate a single reference structure , for each coordinate one chooses a histogram bin according to the probability associated with that bin",
    ". then a coordinate value is chosen at random uniformly within the bin according the jacobian factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq - jacobian])e.g .",
    ", for a bond length @xmath44 , one chooses uniformly in the variable @xmath50 .",
    "the process is repeated for every degree of freedom in the system . by repeating the entire procedure",
    ", one can generate as many reference structures as desired ( i.e. , the reference ensemble ) .      in summary , the method is implemented by first constructing properly normalized histograms for all internal ( or cartesian ) coordinates based on a physical ensemble of structures .",
    "an ensemble of reference structures is then chosen at random from the histograms . the reference energy ( @xmath30 of eq .  (",

    "is used to calculate the desired absolute free energy of the system of interest .",
    "the cpu cost of the method , above that of the initial `` physical '' trajectory , is one physical energy evaluation for each of the @xmath41 reference structures , plus the less expensive cost of generating reference structures .",

    "the figure again shows how the reference system has both excellent overlap with the physical system and is also broader than the physical system .",
    "the present results raise a number of questions regarding the reference system approach to computing absolute free energies  in particular , regarding the use of correlations , the importance of the physical ensemble , and the potential for application to larger systems .",
    "how can correlations among coordinates be used to increase the method s effectiveness ? one may choose to bin coordinates as independent ( i.e. , one - dimensional histograms ) , or with correlations ( i.e. , multi - dimensional histograms ) .",
    "for example , in peptides , one may choose to bin all sets of backbone @xmath62 torsions as correlated , and all other coordinates ( bond lengths , bond angles , other torsions ) as independent .",
    "it might always seem advantageous to bin some coordinates ( at least backbone torsions ) as correlated , since reference structures drawn randomly from the histograms will be less likely to have steric clashes . on the other hand , including correlations with small bin sizes is impractical . as an example , imagine that for the leucine dipeptide molecule used in this study , one binned the four @xmath62 backbone torsions as correlated . if fifty bins for each torsion were used ( as should be done according to the discussion below ) , then there would be @xmath63 multi - dimensional bins to populate , which is simply not feasible .",
    "there does appear to be an important advantage to eliminating at least some correlations from the original `` physical '' ensemble : namely , a larger portion of conformational space becomes available to the reference ensemble ; see figs .",
    "[ fig - scat ] and [ fig - dist ] .",
    "since coordinates for the reference structures are drawn randomly and independently , it is possible to generate reference structures that are in entirely different energy basins than those in the physical ensemble .",
    "_ it is thus possible to overcome the inadequacies of the physical ensemble by binning internal coordinates independently_. the optimal ( presumably ) limited use of correlations will be considered in future work .",
    "regardless of the degree of correlations included in @xmath30 , we emphasize that final results fully include correlations in the physical potential @xmath7 .",
    "since the reference ensemble is generated by drawing at random from histograms which , in turn , were generated from the physical ensemble , a natural question to ask is : how complete does the physical ensemble need to be ?",
    "the surprising answer is that , for our reference system method , the physical ensemble does not need to be complete , or even correct ( properly distributed ) . since eqs .",
    "( [ eq - fphys ] ) and ( [ eq - fphys2 ] ) are valid for arbitrary reference systems , the convergence of the free energy estimate to the correct value is guaranteed , in the limit of infinite sampling ( @xmath64 ) , regardless of the quality of the physical ensemble .",
    "the `` trick '' is that the ensemble for the reference system must be converged , which can be achieved with much less expense since there is no dynamical trapping . unlike the typical case for molecular mechanics simulation , we sample the reference ensemble `` perfectly''there is no possibility of being trapped in a local basin . by construction , since all coordinate values are generated exactly according to the reference distributions , the reference ensemble can only suffer from statistical ( but not systematic ) error .",
    "for example , it was possible to obtain the correct free energy for methane based on 10,000 reference structures even when the histogram for each coordinate was assumed to be flat , i.e. , without the use of a physical ensemble ( data not shown ) .",
    "it is important to note that , while convergence to the correct free energy is guaranteed for any choice of reference system , the efficiency of the method could be dramatically reduced if the reference system does not overlap well with the physical system .",
    "given the fact that the physical ensemble need not be correct , it is easy to imagine a modified method that does not require simulation , but instead populates the histogram bins using the `` bare '' potential for each internal coordinate ( e.g. , gaussian histograms for bond lengths and angles ) .",
    "of course , the conformational state must be defined explicitly , with upper and lower limits for coordinates . allowed ranges for the torsions ( especially @xmath62 )",
    "are naturally obtainable via , e.g. , ramachandran propensities ( e.g. , ref .  ) , and reasonable ranges for bond lengths and angles could be chosen to be , e.g. , several standard deviations from the mean .",
    "while the initial results of our reference system method are promising , a naive implementation of the method will find difficulty with large systems ( as do all absolute and relative free energy methods ) . for our method , the difficulty with including a very large number of degrees of freedom is due to the fact that , if one does not treat all correlations in the backbone , then steric clashes will occur frequently when generating the reference ensemble .",
    "however , it is possible to extend the method to larger peptides , still include all degrees of freedom , and bin all coordinates independently ( important for broadening configurational space , as discussed above ) , by using a `` segmentation '' technique motivated by earlier work .",
    "@xcite consider generating reference structures for a ten - residue peptide in the alpha helix conformation . due to the large number of backbone torsions",
    ", most of the reference structures chosen at random will not be energetically favorable . however",
    ", if one breaks the peptide into two pieces , then one can generate many structures for each segment , and only `` keep '' energetically likely segment structures .",
    "the selected structures may be joined to form full structures which are reasonably likely to have low energy .",
    "for example , if one generates @xmath65 structures for each of the two segments and keeps only @xmath66 of those , then one only need evaluate @xmath67 full structures out of a possible @xmath68 .",
    "a statistically correct segmentation strategy is currently being investigated by the authors for use in large peptides .",
    "another strategy which may prove useful for larger systems is to use the reference system method with multi - stage simulation .",
    "multi - stage simulation requires the introduction of a hybrid potential energy parameterized by @xmath69 , e.g. , @xmath70 thus , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "simulations are performed using the hybrid potential energy @xmath73 ( and thus a hybrid forcefield , if using molecular dynamics ) at intermediate @xmath69 values between 0 and 1 .",
    "conventional free energy methods such as thermodynamic integration or free energy perturbation can then be used to obtain @xmath39 .",
    "we also believe that including correlations , such as suggested by eq .",
    "( [ eq - pcorr ] ) and possibly other ways , may be useful .",
    "the inclusion of correlations should improve the overlap between the reference and physical ensembles  thereby reducing the amount of sampling required in the reference system , hence improving efficiency .",
    "this also will be explored in future work .",
    "( we also remind the reader that the final free energy value includes the full correlations in @xmath7 , regardless of @xmath30 . )",
    "the method could prove useful in future protein - ligand binding studies .",
    "in the simplest approach , one could freeze all degrees of freedom except for the ligand and side - chain degrees of freedom in the binding site . while the absolute free energy would be unphysical",
    ", the approach could permit comparison of ligands or protein mutations with little or no conformational similarity .    in principle",
    ", it is possible to extend the reference system method to include explicitly solvated biomolecules .",
    "however , as with all absolute free energy methods , the addition of the solvent degrees of freedom causes the free energy estimate to converge much more slowly than without explicit solvent .",
    "thus , we feel the method described in this study will find use primarily in implicitly solvated biomolecules .",
    "in conclusion , we have introduced and tested a simple method for calculating absolute free energies in molecular systems .",
    "the approach relies on the construction of an ensemble of reference structures ( i.e. , the reference system ) that is designed to have high overlap with the physical system of interest .",
    "the method was first shown to reproduce exactly computable absolute free energies for simple systems , and then used to correctly predict the stability of leucine dipeptide conformations using all one - hundred fifteen degrees of freedom .",
    "some strengths of the approach are that : ( i ) the reference system is built to have good overlap with the system of interest by using internal coordinates and by using a single equilibrium ensemble from monte carlo or molecular dynamics ; ( ii ) the absolute free energy estimate is guaranteed to converge to the correct value , whether or not the physical ensemble is complete and , in fact , it is possible to estimate the absolute free energy without the use of a physical ensemble ; ( iii ) the method explicitly includes all degrees of freedom employed in the simulation ; ( iv ) the reference system need only be numerically computable , i.e. , the exact analytic result is not needed ; and ( v ) the method can be trivially extended to include the use of multi - stage simulation .",
    "the cpu cost of the approach , beyond that for short trajectories of the physical system of interest , is one energy call for each reference structure , plus the less expensive cost of generating the reference ensemble .    in the present `` proof of principle ''",
    "report , our method was used to study conformational equilibria ; however we feel that the simplicity and flexibility of the method may find broad use in computational biophysics and biochemistry for a wide variety of free energy problems .",
    "we have also described a segmentation strategy , currently being pursued , to use the approach in much larger systems .",
    "the authors would like to thank edward lyman , ronald white , srinath cheluvarajah and hagai meirovitch for many fruitful discussions ."
