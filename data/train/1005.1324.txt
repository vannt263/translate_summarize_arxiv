    "here , we analyse further implications from the mass - dependent @xmath0-function introduced in @xcite .    regarding a variable number of active flavours breaks the two - loop scheme independence (  universality \" ) of the @xmath0-function of non - abelian gauge field theories . considering a fixed number of species is legitimate for energy scales far above or far below their masses . from the viewpoint of renormalisation theory , it is even legal to ignore the freezing out of heavy flavours , although this disregards important physical effects and leads to a pure convergence of the perturbative series .",
    "oftentimes @xmath0-functions for different integer numbers of flavours are glued together at the mass of the species which are switched on or off . already with this procedure",
    "the @xmath0-function coefficients are no longer scheme independent in the above sense .",
    "the passage between different numbers of active flavours should happen gradually .",
    "hence , we based the @xmath0-function in @xcite on a background field momentum subtraction scheme @xcite , which next to the decoupling theorem @xcite also respects the slavnov ",
    "taylor identities @xcite .",
    "an alternative would have been the physical charge approach @xcite , which , however , coincides to lowest order and is otherwise qualitatively and also quantitatively close to the background field momentum subtraction scheme ( see especially fig .  2 in @xcite .",
    ") where the expressions are known analytically .",
    "it turns out that threshold effects are felt more then two orders of magnitude away from the mass of the fermion . in @xcite , we combined this input with the all - order @xmath0-function without threshold effects that had been conjectured in @xcite .",
    "it was motivated by the @xmath1=1 supersymmetric novikov ",
    "zakharov @xmath0-function , has the correct limits in exactly known cases ( super yang  mills theory @xcite or planar equivalence in a large-@xmath2 limit @xcite ) , and at two - loop order it reproduces the universal @xmath0-function .",
    "far away from all thresholds our @xmath0-function reduces to the massless all - order @xmath0-function with a fixed number of flavours , while at two - loop order it coincides with the @xmath0-function in background field momentum subtraction scheme @xcite .",
    "the mass - dependence of the @xmath0-function is important in the context of the conformal window of non - abelian gauge field theories .",
    "it arises from the interplay of the matter content of a theory and chiral symmetry breaking ( see fig .  [ beta ] . ) : with no or little matter [ like in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) ] the antiscreening of the non - abelian gauge bosons forestalls the appearance of an infrared fixed point ( a ) .",
    "slightly more matter admits a perturbative caswell  banks ",
    "zaks @xcite fixed point ( b ) . for this fixed point to be reached it must be situated at a value of the coupling that does not trigger chiral condensation ( d ) . [ with even more matter the theory loses asymptotic freedom ( f ) .",
    "] otherwise the fermions receive a dynamical mass and decouple at least partially , which makes the antiscreening dominate once more ( c ) . where the fixed point is almost reached ( e ) but chiral condensation still sets in we find the quasiconformal case . in the vicinity of the would - be fixed point @xmath3 .",
    "this results in a coupling that stays almost constant (  walks \" ) for a large interval of energy scales at a value slightly below the critical value for chiral condensation .",
    "once chiral condensation is finally triggered the coupling constant begins running again .",
    "what has just been said explains why taking into account the mass of the fermions is a crucial ingredient for gaining an understanding of the dynamics of the theory .",
    "one of our motivations for conducting research into the conformal window of gauge field theories and for the study @xcite is the identification of quasiconformal @xcite technicolour @xcite models that are consistent with presently available electroweak precision data @xcite .",
    "these models feature a rich collider phenomenology accessible to the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite , dark matter candidates @xcite , and are interesting models for studies in the ads / cft framework @xcite .",
    "they break the electroweak symmetry dynamically by chiral symmetry breaking among fermions ( techniquarks ) added to the standard model without its higgs sector .",
    "this gives masses to the weak gauge bosons .",
    "the canonical way to also give masses to the standard model fermions is extended technicolour ( etc ) @xcite . in this context",
    ", the walking serves to relax the tension between the large mass of the top quark , which has to be generated , and the small bounds on flavour changing neutral currents , which have to be avoided .",
    "this is achieved by a sizeable renormalisation enhancement of the techniquark condensate . apart from this primary purpose ,",
    "extended technicolour may also stabilise the vacuum alignment @xcite and make extra nambu ",
    "goldstone modes ( only three of the technipions serve as longitudinal modes of the weak gauge bosons . )",
    "massive enough to avoid direct detection bounds .",
    "the ramifications from extended technicolour are definitely already present before the techniquark condensate forms . some of the effects connected to the stabilisation of the vacuum alignment and the nambu ",
    "goldstone masses are similar in nature to an explicit mass term akin to the electroweakly induced quark masses relative to the chiral dynamics of quantum chromodynamics .",
    "therefore , in phenomenological applications the question after exact conformality is somewhat academic : the dynamics of  pure \" technicolour are perturbed due to the coupling to the electroweak and extended technicolour .",
    "if the technipions are only to be removed outside detection bounds these modifications can be moderate or even altogether zero @xcite .",
    "if , however , some of the technipions are to be heavy enough to serve as dark matter candidates , the modification is substantial .",
    "it is possible that these perturbations influence the amount of walking of a theory or even make a theory conformal , which otherwise would be exactly conformal .",
    "as just discussed , in  massless \" technicolour theories , walking is caused by intrinsically non - perturbative dynamics . as was already pointed out in @xcite ,",
    "there is also the possibility to see walking from more perturbative effects : consider an asymptotically free gauge theory that for massless flavours would feature an infrared fixed point but where some of the fermion have  hard \" masses in analogy to the electroweak masses as seen by quantum chromodynamics .",
    "then the infrared fixed point is never reached because the heavy fermions will freeze out for low energy scales , but , depending on the initial conditions , can be approached very closely .",
    "we are going to study this circumstance closely in what follows .",
    "the plateau in the evolution of the coupling is the eponym for walking theories .",
    "the feature of importance for the construction of viable technicolour models is the renormalisation of the mass operator of the fermions , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 stands for the anomalous dimension of said operator and @xmath6 for the energy scale .",
    "therefore , we will concentrate on this quantity .",
