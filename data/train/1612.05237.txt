    "<S> , the scaling matches that for a ghz state with @xmath174 yielding at the metrology equivalence for non - local dissipators . </S>",
    "<S> our result can be generalized to @xmath1-body dephasing channels for which the interrogation time is of the order of @xmath175 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the parameter estimation of @xmath14 scales as @xmath176 for @xmath173 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we obtain the same scaling for product and ghz states , using the first bound in equation , which proves their metrology equivalence under many - body decoherence .    </S>",

    "<S> we also show that the sum of the variances of the lindblad operators @xmath191 scales as @xmath192 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it follows from our previous results , see equations and , that the scaling of the estimation error for the parameter @xmath181 is set by the range of the interactions according to @xmath193 which beats the shot - noise limit for @xmath194 , gives the heisenberg and super - heisenberg limit for @xmath195 , and leads to a maximum precision with exponent @xmath196 for @xmath197 .    </S>",

    "<S> as shown by the second bound in equation , the precision of the estimation of the parameter @xmath200 is significantly enhanced @xmath206 this is to be contrasted with the scaling @xmath171 associated with an uncorrelated dissipator describing the decoherence of each particle by an independent bath , see master equation .    _ conclusion and outlook . </S>",

    "<S> in addition , we have shown that the precision of the estimated system - environment coupling @xmath15 is limited by @xmath5 , while for fluctuating @xmath0-body hamiltonian system an enhanced scaling @xmath6 governs the precision of the amplitude of the noise . </S>",
