    "the near operation of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) represents a remarkable opportunity to explore physics beyond the electroweak scale .",
    "in particular , physics at higher scales can be explored in the lepton sector  @xcite , where the only evidence of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) has been found up to now , namely massive neutrinos .",
    "many theories have been proposed to enlarge the sm incorporating tiny neutrino masses , as required by experimental data @xcite . among them , seesaw models explain their smallness by introducing extra matter at a high scale . after integration of these heavy fields , the lepton number violating ( lnv ) dimension five operator @xcite @xmath3",
    "is generated , where @xmath4 are the sm left - handed lepton doublets , @xmath5 the sm higgs and @xmath6 , with @xmath7 the pauli matrices .",
    "this operator yields majorana masses for the neutrinos after spontaneous symmetry breaking . at higher energies neutrino masses can be generated from higher dimension operators involving extra fields ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) but when all heavy degrees of freedom are integrated the operator in eq .  (",
    "[ ec : o5 ] ) is recovered .",
    "there are three types of tree - level seesaw mechanisms which originate the operator in eq .",
    "( [ ec : o5 ] ) , which is the only five - dimensional one allowed by the @xmath8 gauge symmetry .",
    "the original seesaw @xcite , also known as seesaw of type i , introduces right - handed neutrino singlets @xmath9 at a high scale .",
    "type ii seesaw @xcite enlarges the sm with a complex scalar triplet @xmath10 with hypercharge @xmath11 , and seesaw iii @xcite introduces colourless fermionic triplets @xmath12 with @xmath13 . both seesaw i and ii are present in left - right models @xcite .",
    "combinations of seesaw i and iii are predicted in some grand unified theories @xcite , and can be implemented in left - right models as well @xcite .",
    "the three types of seesaw mechanism generate not only the dimension five operator which gives light neutrino masses , but also additional lepton number conserving ( lnc ) dimension six operators , which are different in each seesaw scenario @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . therefore",
    ", seesaw models may in principle be discriminated , albeit indirectly , with precise low - energy measurements sensitive to these dimension six operators .",
    "the seesaw messengers @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath12 can also be produced at lhc if their masses are not very large but of the order of the electroweak scale and , in the case of neutrino singlets , if their mixing with the sm leptons is of order @xmath14 or larger .",
    "therefore , lhc gives a unique chance to uncover the mechanism of neutrino mass generation if these heavy states are directly observed .",
    "the production of heavy neutrinos  @xcite , scalar triplets  @xcite and fermion triplets  @xcite and their possible signals have been extensively studied in the literature . in this paper",
    "we take a novel approach to their analysis . instead of classifying signals in terms of the particles produced in the hard process and studying one or more particular channels ,",
    "we classify them by the signatures actually seen at the experiment , generating _ all _ the signal contributions . as the number of jets in the final state is not a good discriminant due to radiation and pile - up , signals are classified in terms of the charged lepton multiplicity , and the number of hard jets is considered only in few special cases as an extra information for the kinematical reconstruction .",
    "we believe that this is a more appropriate choice from the experimental point of view .",
    "an essential feature of a real experiment is that the observed final states receive in general contributions from several signal processes and , conversely , one given signal process contributes to several final states if , for example , one or more charged leptons are missed by the detector .",
    "both effects are taken into account in our analysis , which includes the effects of radiation , pile - up and hadronisation , performed by a parton shower monte carlo , and uses a fast detector simulation . within a given seesaw scenario",
    "we simulate all signal processes and then examine thoroughly the relevant final states , nine in total , ranging from one to six charged leptons .    a second difference with respect to previous literature concerns the guiding principle of the analyses performed . due to the profusion of new physics scenarios to be tested at the lhc",
    "it is expected that , at least in a first phase , searches will be inclusive to some extent and rather model - independent , in order to be sensitive to different types of new physics contributing to a given channel .",
    "for example , it is not likely that , in the absence of a strong physics case , a final state with two like - sign leptons , large missing energy , two jets with an invariant mass consistent with the @xmath15 mass and two additional jets will be examined right from the beginning of lhc operation . on the contrary ,",
    "searches are expected , for example , for inclusive final states with two like - sign leptons , as it has already been done at tevatron  @xcite .",
    "( with this philosophy , our classification of signals in terms of lepton multiplicity is perfectly suited . ) then , in our analyses we will not set fine - tuned kinematical cuts on many variables to enhance the signals , but our criteria for variable selection and background suppression will be rather general , and in most cases valid for seesaw i , ii and iii signals . in this way , our results and procedures will be adequate for model - independent searches in the multi - lepton final states .",
    "of course , if some hint of new physics is found the analyses can be refined and adapted to some particular scenario , in order to reconstruct the resonance masses and/or enhance the sensitivity .",
    "finally , we pay a special attention to the discrimination among models if a positive signal is found .",
    "this study is far more involved than the `` simple '' observation of a new physics signal from seesaw messengers in one or few particular channels , to which most previous literature has been devoted . on the contrary , model discrimination requires a systematic analysis of all possible final states and the reconstruction of the new resonances when possible .",
    "the three types of seesaw can give signals with one , two and three charged leptons , plus a variable number of jets ( which , as stressed before , is not very indicative because of radiation and pile - up , added to the difficulty of the mass reconstruction in hadronic channels ) .",
    "final states with four charged leptons @xmath16 ( with @xmath17 , including all flavour combinations of the four leptons ) only arise in seesaw ii and iii scenarios , and @xmath18 signals only in seesaw iii , as well as five and six lepton final states .",
    "therefore , a first straightforward discrimination of seesaw models results from considering the final states in which the signals can be seen and their statistical significance , which are not the same for seesaw i , ii and iii . moreover ,",
    "if a positive signal is found in a given channel , the mass reconstruction of the heavy resonance can be often performed and its charge measured , giving clear direct evidence for the production of the new particle .",
    "for example , doubly charged scalars @xmath19 produced in seesaw ii models often give from their decay a signal consisting of two like - sign leptons with an invariant mass very close to @xmath20 , whereas the spectrum of like - sign dilepton invariant masses in seesaw i and iii does not exhibit any peak . for high integrated luminosities",
    ", the opening angle distribution can also be tested in the cleanest channels , giving evidence for the scalar or fermionic nature of the heavy states produced .",
    "we also have to point out that , since the main interest in the arrival of the lhc era is in early discoveries ( and a luminosity of 300 fb@xmath21 will not be available until several years of lhc operation , in the optimistic scenarios ) , we have concentrated our study on seesaw messengers with masses close to the electroweak scale , which in the case of seesaw ii and iii would be quickly discovered after quality data are available .",
    "thus , for heavy neutrino singlets we have assumed a mass @xmath22 gev , while for scalar and triplet fermions the mass has been taken as 300 gev .",
    "we have found that the best channel for discovery , balancing large signal branching ratios and small backgrounds , is the trilepton one @xmath0 .",
    "for scalar triplets of this mass , @xmath23 discovery would be possible with only 3.6 fb@xmath21 of luminosity for normal neutrino mass hierarchy ( nh ) and 0.9 fb@xmath21 for inverted hierarchy ( ih ) .",
    "for fermionic triplets the luminosity needed is 2.5 fb@xmath21 , while for heavy neutrino singlets it is much larger , around 180 fb@xmath21 . a clean model discrimination would be possible within the first lhc year with 10 fb@xmath21 .    in this paper",
    "we work out the minimal seesaw i ",
    "iii scenarios without new interactions .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the latter can mediate new production mechanisms of seesaw messengers , for example , heavy neutrinos in models with left - right symmetry and an additional @xmath24 boson  @xcite , models with an additional @xmath25  @xcite or with new scalar doublets  @xcite .",
    "the same type of signals can also be produced by fourth generation neutrinos@xcite .",
    "new interactions can also lead to predictive indirect seesaw signals , as for example in type ii seesaw in the context of supersymmetric models  @xcite .",
    "alternatives to the seesaw mechanism are also possible , for example in @xmath26-parity violating supersymmetric models , leading to interesting connections between neutrino physics and collider observables  @xcite ( for reviews see refs .",
    "@xcite and references there in ) .",
    "the rest of this paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec:2 ]",
    "we write down the relevant lagrangian terms for the three seesaw types .",
    "we concentrate on the interactions mediating the production and decay processes considered in this work using a notation that , while being general , is intended to be standard and of easy use for readers not familiar with the models introduced . in section  [ sec:3 ] we describe in detail the common features of the analyses , which are performed in sections [ sec:4 ] , [ sec:5 ] and [ sec:6 ] for heavy neutrinos , scalar triplets and fermion triplets , respectively .",
    "we begin these sections with a short introduction , and conclude them with a summary highlighting the main results , so that the reader may skip the details .",
    "our conclusions are drawn in section  [ sec:7 ] . in the appendix",
    "we give the feynman rules used in the monte carlo generators .",
    "in this section we introduce the different seesaw models , set our conventions and write the lagrangian terms relevant to the production and decay processes studied here .",
    "we keep the notation as simple as possible and similar for the three types of seesaw mechanism .",
    "constraints on the mixing of the new fermions and scalars are briefly reviewed at the end of each subsection .",
    "the feynman rules are collected in the appendix .",
    "type - i seesaw is usually implemented by adding three right - handed current eigenstates @xmath27 , @xmath28 , transforming as singlets under the sm gauge group .",

    "another physical effect which can not be included in parton - level calculations is the production of isolated charged leptons from @xmath140 quark decays . as we found in previous work",

    "e.g. _ when they originate from @xmath141 decays . in any case , suppressing these backgrounds without eliminating important signal contributions is not easy . a third effect which makes a parton level calculation insufficient",
    "is that sometimes a charged lepton is missed by the detector , for example because it is located inside a hadronic jet and thus it is not isolated .",
    "this is important , for instance , for like - sign dilepton signals , where one of the main backgrounds is @xmath164 production when one of the leptons from the @xmath56 decay is missed by the detector .    in order to have predictions for sm backgrounds as accurate as possible we use alpgen  @xcite to generate hard events    .background processes considered in the simulations .",

    "table  [ tab : summ ] shows that , if a positive signal is found , it should be possible to identify whether it corresponds to heavy neutrinos , scalar / fermion triplets , or other new physics , by analysing the different channels and performing the mass reconstruction .",
    "for larger luminosities the study of production angular distributions is possible , as it has been shown in several final states for scalar and fermion triplet signals . a rough estimate of the lhc discovery reach can be made by applying a simple rescaling of the results presented , obtaining that scalar triplets can be discovered up to 600 gev ( 800 gev ) for nh ( ih ) with a luminosity of 30 fb@xmath21 .",

    "these results are consistent with the ones in table  [ tab : summ ] because for larger @xmath52 the heavy neutrino signals can be separated from the background more easily , and also because the analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite is much more sophisticated .",
    "new interactions , which could lead to new processes in addition to the ones discussed here , have not been considered in this work .",
    "it is interesting to discuss briefly , without a detailed simulation of those signals , how one might in principle distinguish some of these scenarios from the ones studied here . in models with left - right symmetry",
    "heavy neutrino singlets can be produced through @xmath171-channel @xmath172 ( @xmath24 ) exchange @xcite @xmath173 this process gives the same dilepton and trilepton final states as @xmath15 exchange but with large transverse momenta , which are not possible without new interactions .",

    "new gauge bosons might also contribute to the production of scalar and fermion triplets , and their presence would be seen by examining the invariant mass distribution of all the produced particles . besides , it is likely that new interactions would be observed in other production processes not involving seesaw messengers .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning that , since this study has been done at the level of a fast detector simulation , we have not addressed charge misidentification",
    ". its effect may be important in like - sign dilepton final states , because the cross section for @xmath177 production at lhc is very large .",
    "however , for final states with more leptons , _ e.g. _",

    "<S> , it is found that the trilepton channel @xmath0 is by far the best one for scalar triplet discovery , and for fermion triplets it is as good as the like - sign dilepton channel @xmath1 . for heavy neutrinos with a mass @xmath2 gev , </S>",
    "<S> this trilepton channel is also better than the usually studied like - sign dilepton mode . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to evaluating the discovery potential , we make special emphasis on the discrimination among seesaw models if a positive signal is observed . </S>",
    "<S> this could be accomplished not only by searching for signals in different final states , but also by reconstructing the mass and determining the charge of the new resonances , which is possible in several cases . for high luminosities , further evidence is provided by the analysis of the production angular distributions in the cleanest channels with three or four leptons .    * </S>",
