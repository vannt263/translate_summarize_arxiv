    "the primary purpose of the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) is to shed light on the dynamics of electroweak symmetry breaking . in the standard model ( sm ) , this involves the discovery of the higgs boson and the measurement of its mass - generating couplings to fermions and gauge bosons .",
    "most extensions of the sm contain one or more higgs - like scalars that play a similar role in mass generation ; the characterization of such models also involves measurement of the couplings of these scalars to the sm fermions and gauge bosons .",
    "the lhc will be able to measure higgs signal rates in a variety of production and decay modes  @xcite , especially if the higgs mass lies in the range 114  gev  @xmath11  gev , as suggested by direct searches  @xcite and electroweak precision data  @xcite .",
    "these signal rate measurements will provide access to the combinations of higgs couplings that determine the production cross sections and decay branching ratios involved in each channel . by taking ratios of higgs signal rates with either the production mode or the decay mode in common , ratios of higgs couplings - squared can be found with no model - dependent assumptions  @xcite .",
    "unfolding the individual higgs couplings from these rate measurements , however , is a major challenge .",
    "the main difficulty lies in the fact that the lhc will not provide an absolute higgs production cross section measurement in any channel . together with the possible presence of undetectable higgs decay modes",
    "( e.g. , @xmath12 or decays into light quarks ) , this leads to a degeneracy in the higgs coupling fit corresponding to increasing all production couplings by a common factor while simultaneously decreasing the detectable branching fractions by the same factor .",
    "this forces the adoption of theoretical assumptions in higgs coupling fits .",
    "analyses of lhc higgs coupling extraction prospects have dealt with this difficulty either by assuming that the total higgs width is dominated by the known sm decay modes  @xcite , or by assuming that the couplings of the higgs to @xmath5 and @xmath6 are bounded from above by their sm values  @xcite ( the latter analyses make the simultaneous assumption that the ratio of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 couplings is the same as in the sm ) .",
    "the latter approach allows the total width of the higgs to be bounded from above by a rate measurement in a channel with higgs production and decay via the @xmath13 or @xmath14 coupling ( e.g. , weak boson fusion with @xmath15 ) .",
    "these two assumptions about the @xmath13 and @xmath14 couplings are valid in any higgs sector that contains only su(2)@xmath1 doublets and/or singlets .",
    "larger su(2)@xmath1 multiplets are usually considered unimportant because their contribution to the @xmath13 and @xmath14 couplings are generally tightly constrained by the experimental limits on the @xmath2 parameter .    in this paper",
    "we explore the possibility that these assumptions about the @xmath13 and @xmath14 couplings are violated .",
    "to do so , we need a model with at least one higgs doublet ( required to generate fermion masses ) , together with at least one larger su(2)@xmath1 representation ( to give rise to group - theoretic coefficients in the @xmath13 and @xmath14 couplings different from those of a doublet ) . because the couplings of interest arise from quartic terms in the lagrangian in which one scalar field is replaced by its vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , we need the vev(s ) of the larger su(2)@xmath1 multiplet(s ) to be non - negligible .",
    "to this end we study a model containing one higgs doublet and two triplets first introduced by georgi and machacek  @xcite .",
    "one triplet is real with hypercharge zero while the other is complex with hypercharge 1 .",
    "because these two triplets contribute to the @xmath2 parameter with opposite sign , their vevs need not be small so long as they are chosen such that their contributions to @xmath2 cancel ; this is achieved naturally by imposing a global `` custodial '' su(2 ) symmetry  @xcite .",
    "( the required global symmetry is however broken by hypercharge , so it is no longer exact once radiative corrections are included  @xcite . )",
    "the model contains three cp - even neutral scalars .",
    "we study one of these states , which we call @xmath0 and parameterize as a general mixture of the three weak eigenstates .",
    "we find that the @xmath13 and @xmath14 couplings can be significantly larger than their sm values , and that the ratio of these couplings can be significantly different from the ratio in the sm .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we summarize the model and present general expressions for the couplings of interest . in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerics ] we study the range of @xmath13 and @xmath14 couplings allowed in the model , subject to experimental constraints that set a lower bound on the doublet vev .",
    "we also consider the impact on higgs production and decay in two of the most promising early higgs discovery channels at the lhc , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "in particular , we find that the @xmath16 rate can be significantly enhanced compared to that in the sm , due to a suppression of the @xmath17 branching fraction in some parts of parameter space without a simultaneous suppression of @xmath18 . in sec .  [",
    "sec : howtotell ] we discuss ways to experimentally determine whether the @xmath14 and @xmath13 couplings have the same ratio as in the sm and whether these couplings are larger than their sm values . in sec .",

    "some computational details are given in the appendices .",
    "the georgi - machacek model  @xcite contains a complex su(2)@xmath1 scalar doublet @xmath19 with hypercharge @xmath20 , a real triplet @xmath21 with @xmath22 , and a complex triplet @xmath23 with @xmath24 , with components and vevs denoted by @xmath25 starting from the canonically normalized covariant derivative terms in the scalar lagrangian , we obtain the @xmath26 and @xmath27 boson masses and their couplings to the cp - even neutral scalars as follows : @xmath28 \\nonumber \\\\    & & + ( v_{\\xi } + \\xi^0)^2     \\left[4 \\ , \\frac{g^2}{4 } w_{\\mu}^+ w^{- \\mu } \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\    & & + ( v_{\\chi } + \\chi^{0,r})^2    \\left[2 \\ , \\frac{g^2}{4 } w_{\\mu}^+ w^{- \\mu }      + 4 \\ , \\frac{g^2 + g^{\\prime 2}}{8 } z_{\\mu } z^{\\mu } \\right ] ,    \\label{eq : kineticterms}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the su(2)@xmath1 and u(1)@xmath31 gauge couplings of the sm , respectively .",

    "the squared masses of the @xmath26 and @xmath27 bosons are then given by @xmath32 where we define @xmath33 .",
    "the different form of the triplet contributions to the @xmath26 and @xmath27 masses results in a tree - level @xmath2 parameter different from 1 , @xmath34 where we used the definition @xmath35 .",
    "the @xmath2 parameter also receives radiative corrections in the sm from isospin violation , depending mostly on the top quark and sm higgs masses . after separating out the sm contributions , the constraint on new sources of su(2 ) breaking",
    "is given at the 2@xmath36 level by  @xcite @xmath37 this leads to the requirement @xmath38 to high precision .",
    "this relation can be enforced by imposing an su(2)@xmath39 global symmetry on the higgs potential , resulting in a residual global `` custodial '' su(2 ) symmetry  the diagonal subgroup of su(2)@xmath40  su(2)@xmath39after electroweak symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "the su(2)@xmath39 global symmetry is broken by hypercharge ( for the scalars , hypercharge corresponds to the @xmath41 generator of su(2)@xmath39 ) , so that su(2)@xmath39-violating counterterms must be introduced at one - loop level  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , if the scale where su(2)@xmath39 is a good symmetry is not too high , the approximate global symmetry protects the @xmath2 parameter and has been used , e.g. , to control the effects of triplets on electroweak precision observables in little higgs models  @xcite .    the imposition of custodial su(2 ) on the higgs potential results in higgs mass eigenstates after electroweak symmetry breaking that lie in multiplets of the custodial su(2 ) with common masses  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the physical states form two singlets @xmath42 and @xmath43 , a 3-plet @xmath44 , and a 5-plet @xmath45 under custodial su(2 ) , with the cp - even neutral states given by  @xcite @xmath46 if the custodial su(2 ) is exact , the two singlets @xmath42 and @xmath47 can mix , but @xmath48 must be a mass eigenstate .    in this framework , the couplings of the cp - even neutral states to @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and fermion pairs are given by  @xcite @xmath49 where we define @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and the barred couplings are normalized to the corresponding sm higgs couplings , @xmath52 .",
    "in this paper we relax the assumption of custodial su(2 ) in the higgs potential .",
    "we still require that @xmath38 in order to obey the constraint on the @xmath2 parameter , but we allow arbitrary mixing of the three cp - even neutral higgs states .",
    "this is a fine - tuned situation , but it allows us to illustrate the full range of couplings allowed by experimental constraints .",
    "we will also present results for custodial su(2)-preserving mixing .",
    "the most general gauge - invariant higgs potential ( without custodial su(2 ) ) is given in appendix  [ app : potential ] , where we show that enough parameter freedom exists to allow arbitrary mixing even after the vevs are fixed as above .",

    "<S> we study the couplings of a cp - even neutral higgs boson @xmath0 in a model containing one scalar su(2)@xmath1 doublet , one real triplet , and one complex triplet with hypercharge 1 . because the two triplets contribute to the @xmath2 parameter with opposite signs , the triplet vacuum expectation values can be sizable . </S>",
    "<S> we show that ( i ) the @xmath3 and @xmath4 couplings can be larger than the corresponding values in the standard model , and ( ii ) the ratio of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 couplings of @xmath0 can be different than the corresponding ratio in the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> neither of these results can occur in models containing only higgs doublets . </S>",
    "<S> we also compute the rates for @xmath7 and @xmath8 and find that , for reasonable parameter values and @xmath9180  gev , the hadron collider rate for @xmath10 ( @xmath6 ) can be up to 20% ( 5 times ) larger than in the standard model . </S>",
