    "a much stronger measure of homogeneity arises when we ask for ( [ z.1 ] ) to hold over the prespecified collection of testing intervals @xmath15 specifically , if @xmath16 , we would demand that there exists @xmath17 so that @xmath18 where @xmath19    we use an additional rule to express homogeneity with respect to testing intervals that satisfy @xmath20 .",
    "the necessity of such a rule arises from the fact that the cardinalities @xmath21 take values in @xmath22 , hence if @xmath23 , then ( [ z.2 ] ) has to fail",
    ". thus , there are two regimes  high cardinality and low cardinality of @xmath24 , and the transistion arises at @xmath25 .",
