    "an important issue in the hubbard model is the nature of the metal - insulator transition , whether it is more mott - like ( driven by suppression of double occupancy , with no accompanying magnetic order ) or more slater - like ( associated with magnetic order and a stoner - factor instability ) .",
    "the question is rather subtle , since for instance a mott phase can have a significant exchange coupling , which can lead to a parasitic magnetic order at low temperatures . alternatively ,",
    "critical fluctuations in a two - dimensional system will drive the magnetic ordering temperature to zero ( mermin - wagner theorem ) while leaving behind a finite temperature pseudogap .",
    "recently tocchio , becca , parola , and sorella ( tbps)@xcite carried out a variational calculation of the @xmath0 hubbard model at half filling , and found that the whole @xmath3 phase diagram , fig .",
    "1(a ) is dominated either by paramagnetic phases or by phases with long - range magnetic order ( solid green line ) , except for a small window of nonmagnetic insulator ( ` spin liquid '  dashed green line ) . here",
    "we show that the ordered magnetic phase boundaries can be well reproduced by simpler gutzwiller calculations , and that all of these instabilities are only weakly renormalized from the rpa values .",
    "these calculations are sufficiently simple that full allowance can be made for incommensurability [ tbps only studied antiferromagnetic order at @xmath4 and @xmath5 , leading to a much richer phase diagram .",
    "the domain where tbps found the spin liquid phase is characterized by a large number of competing phases , leading to potential frustration .    using a gutzwiller approximation ( ga ) , brinkman and rice ( br)@xcite found a sharp metal - insulator transition at a critical @xmath6 , where the effective mass diverges and the average double occupancy @xmath7 goes continuously to zero .",
    "the br line is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the average kinetic energy per carrier below the fermi energy @xmath10 .",
    "while the sharp second order transition is now known to be an artifact of the simplified variational scheme@xcite , @xmath11 signals a crossover to a regime of small @xmath7 , and hence can still serve as a measure of strong correlations",
    ".    however , we will show in the present paper that the br transition usually takes place at much larger @xmath2 than a magnetic instability towards an incommensurate magnetic state",
    ". we will give a detailed analyis of these instabilites in terms of double nesting and discuss the differences between hartree - fock ( hf ) and the ga approach concerning the magnetic phase diagram . before presenting the corresponding results in sec .",

    "it is seen that while the spin liquid phase falls above @xmath11 , magnetic phases arise for much lower @xmath2s , and the commensurate ga transitions are in excellent agreement with @xmath62 .",
    "since the phase boundaries depend only on @xmath63 , we illustrate only the situation @xmath64 appropriate to the cuprates .",

    "these changes are associated with the evolution of the fermi surface ( fs ) with @xmath1 , as discussed below .",

    "1 suggests the cuprates are closer to slater than to mott physics . within the br model ,",

    "2(c ) estimates for the double occupancy @xmath7 are plotted within the ga , for an assumed @xmath50 , @xmath51 , representative of the cuprates .",
    "the relatively small reduction of @xmath7 explains why the hf+rpa results are so accurate . since @xmath70 ,",
    "the present results are consistent with the small observed enhancement of the effective mass ( circles in fig .",
    "thus , in cuprates the double occupancy @xmath7 is reduced not by mott physics but by strong afm fluctuations .",
    "in fact , the mean - field afm suppresses double occupancy so well that gutzwiller projection on an afm ground state actually _ increases _",
    "double occupancy.@xcite    in fig .",
    "2 , it must be kept in mind that @xmath65 and @xmath48 define the onset of the magnetic instability , via a stoner criterion . as @xmath2 increases beyond the onset",
    ", a finite gap is opened and the optimal @xmath39 can change . at large @xmath2",
    "the entire fermi surface is gapped , and the @xmath39 s which produce the largest gaps are favored .",
    "in order to access this crossover to commensurate phases we compute the energies of spiral textures within the spin rotational invariant extension of the ga @xcite as outlined in sec .",
    "the most stable spiral is determined by searching for the spiral wave - vector @xmath71 which minimizes the ga energy . for values",
    "slightly larger than @xmath48 we consistently find the minimum of the energy landscape @xmath72 close to the momenta of the instabilities as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1b]a . upon further increasing @xmath73 and depending on @xmath74 the momenta @xmath75 shift either towards the diagonal @xmath76 or towards the line @xmath77 . for a critical @xmath73",
    "one then finally finds a first order transition towards either nel order @xmath78 or towards linear antiferromagnetic ( laf ) order at @xmath79 [ or equivalently @xmath80.@xcite this first order transition involves a _ topological transition of the fermi surface _ , from a spiral phase with pockets to a fully gapped commensurate phase .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:1b]a we show the first order line ( light green ) as an upper boundary for the incommensurate regime together with @xmath48 as the lower transition ( blue line ) between incommensurate spin spirals and paramagnet .",
    "the boundary between nel and laf order ( light green dashed line ) is close to the corresponding transition found by tbps@xcite ( green dotted line ) .",
    "note that the ( charge - rotationally invariant ) ga samples all possible incommensuabilities , so we confirm that the two ordered phases found by tbps are indeed the only allowed ordered phases for large enough @xmath2 . however , within the present scheme there is no energy gain for projected bcs wave - functions in the repulsive hubbard model .",
    "therefore , while our simplified scheme allows for a detailed determination of magnetic phase boundaries we can not access the spin liquid regime found by tbps ( cf .",
    "[ fig:1b]c ) .",
    "we also would like to point out that besides spiral textures the incommensurate regime may also contain spin density wave solutions with an associated small charge density modulation .",
    "however , for selected solutions we have checked that this has only a marginal influence on the first order transition line which in fig .",
    "[ fig:1b ] is of the order of the line width .",
    "figures  3 and  4 show how the fs evolves with @xmath1 , and how this is reflected in the peak susceptibility .",
    "3(a ) displays a map of @xmath81 for @xmath82 , showing that @xmath83 is dominated by a complex series of ridges , partly defining a diamond - shaped plateau centered at @xmath4 .",
    "the origin of these structures is readily apparent from fig .",
    "3(b ) using the concept of nesting curves .",
    "for the generic case of two fermi surface segments , a nesting curve can be defined as the locus of all points @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is a point on the @xmath18th fs , fs@xmath86 , with the restriction that when fs@xmath87 is shifted by @xmath47 it is tangent to fs@xmath59 . for the parameters of fig .",
    "2(a , b ) one has one fermi surface and the nesting curve is simply given by @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the ( anisotropic ) fermi wave vector .",
    "the case of two fermi surfaces is discussed below .",
    "the dashed lines are extensions of the nesting curves folded back into the first bz .",
    "it can be seen that all of the sharp structure in @xmath83 falls along this nesting curve , and the susceptibility peaks correspond to points where two branches of the curve cross .",
    "these values indicate @xmath39-vectors which nest the fs , and the crossing points correspond to double nesting , along two separate regions of the fs ( see fig .  4 , below ) .",

    "figures  3(a , b ) illustrate the typical behavior at small @xmath63 ( appropriate for cuprates ) . from fig .",
    "2(a ) , the peak susceptibility is seen to be approximately commensurate at @xmath4 for @xmath92 [ brown circles ] , then becomes vertically incommensurate @xmath93 for @xmath94 [ blue circles ] . for @xmath95 , a diagonal incommensurate @xmath96 phase arises [ green circles ] .",
    "competition between these two phases , corresponding to the points @xmath97 and @xmath98 in fig .",

    "the positions of @xmath97 and @xmath98 are readily determined , fig .",

    "the topology of the band dispersion undergoes a drastic change at @xmath104 . at that ratio the van hove singularity ( vhs ) moves down to the bottom of the band , leading to a dispersionless band along the @xmath105 and @xmath106 axes . beyond @xmath107 ,",
    "the vhs moves away from the band bottom , but now the point @xmath108 changes from the band minimum to a local maximum , opening the possibility of a second fs section . at @xmath109 ,",
    "this section crosses the fermi level at half filling , leading to a more complicated susceptibility map , fig .",

    "the nesting curves match the positions of sharp structure in @xmath83 .",
    "[ for the inter - fs nesting , the @xmath39-value corresponds to shifting one fs until it is tangent to the second . ]",
    "this leads to a greatly increased number of nesting curve intersections , and the @xmath83 peak shifts , first , briefly , to a @xmath112-mixed nesting curve intersection ( orange line in fig .",
    "2(b ) ) , then to a @xmath113-mixed nesting curve ( violet line ) .",
    "figure  3 provides an example of double nesting , showing two competing @xmath39-peaks , corresponding to @xmath97 and @xmath98 in fig .",
    "here nesting vector a [ green arrows ] involves double nesting of the large fs [ green fss ] , while in b [ orange arrows ] one nesting involves the large fs [ brown fs ] , but the other involves nesting between the large fs and the @xmath108-centered pocket [ orange fs ] .",
    "-shifted versions , illustrating two ( competing ) examples of double nesting .",
    "data are for @xmath114 , @xmath115 , as in fig .  2  ( c , d ) [ arrows].,width=302 ]",
    "increasingly , it is becoming clear that many of the complications of strongly correlated systems have to do with competing phases , whether leading to nanoscale phase separation , ` stripes ' , or frustration .",
    "however , part of the problem is a very incomplete understanding of phase competition even at weak coupling , and how the competing phases evolve between weak and strong coupling . in this sense",
    "the magnetic instability of the two - dimensional hubbard model provides an ideal case study , having a parameter space which is two - dimensional ( @xmath116 , @xmath117 ) . in hf+rpa @xmath2",
    "is constant and the competition reduces to finding the maximum of @xmath83 ( stoner criterion ) .",
    "we find that the gutzwiller correction leads only to quantitative ( close to numerical results ) and not qualitative ( gain / loss of new phase ) changes .",
    "hence , the nesting curves introduced herein should provide valuable tools for determining the optimal nesting vectors for many different correlated materials , and how these evolve with doping , temperature , impurity scattering , etc .    in commenting on the calculation of tbps , becca , tocchio , and sorella@xcite summarized earlier attempts to characterize the phase diagram of the model : `` remarkably",
    ", all these numerical approaches give very different results for the ground - state properties of this simple correlated model .",
    "in fact , there are huge discrepancies for determining the boundaries of various phases , but also for characterizing the most interesting non - magnetic insulator . ''",
    "here , we have presented two additional phase diagrams , in hf and ga+rpa approximations .",
    "a key point is that with increasing u the first instability is generically to an incommensurate phase controlled by fermi surface nesting . for larger @xmath2",
    "the fs is fully gapped , nesting is unimportant , and the only stable magnetic phases are the two commensurate phases found by tbps .",
    "for the rest our phase boundaries agree with tbps except for the spin liquid phase which is beyond the capabilities of a simple mean field approximation .",
