    "is by far the largest inelastic channel .",
    "it is dominated by @xmath7-channel meson exchange in combination with the excitation of one of the nucleons into the @xmath25 resonance - or to a lesser extent to the roper resonance @xmath26 with subsequent decay into the @xmath27 system .    in the description of the dilepton",
    "spectra two - pion production has not been taken into account in most of the previous works , since its cross section is smaller by a order of magnitude . however , as we will show in the following , due to the relatively large decay branching @xmath28 the @xmath6 production in the @xmath5 channel contributes significantly to the electron - positron spectrum for @xmath29 0.3 gev / c@xmath1 .    in ref . @xcite",
    "two - pion production has been accounted for in some global manner . here",
    "we proceed differently .",
    "since the two - pion channels have been investigated experimetally meanwhile by exclusive and kinematically complete measurements , we know the dominating two - pion production mechanisms in dependence of the energy in detail",
    ". in particular , we may perform an isospin decomposition of experimental cross sections and underlying reaction mechanisms , in order to separate their contributions to @xmath3 and @xmath2 induced dilepton production .",
    "in recent years the two - pion production in @xmath3 and @xmath2 collisions has been measured by exclusive and kinematically complete experiments over the energy region from threshold up to @xmath30 = 1.4 gev @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the @xmath3 induced two - pion production process is dominated by @xmath7-channel roper and @xmath8 excitation @xcite . in the latter both nucleons are mutually excited to the @xmath31 resonance by @xmath7-channel meson exchange in the collision process .",
    "the roper excitation process dominates at energies close to threshold below 1 gev , whereas the @xmath8 process takes over above 1 gev .",
    "hence in the following we will focus on the latter two - pion production process . and",
    "since the hades experiment has been carried out at @xmath32 = 1.25  gev , we will concentrate on this energy .    in @xmath2 induced two - pion production in addition the recently discovered dibaryon resonance structure @xmath33 with @xmath34 , m = 2.37 gev / c@xmath1 and @xmath35 = 70 mev strongly contributes at energies around 1.2 gev due to its decay @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the total inclusive cross section for @xmath3 induced @xmath6 production at @xmath32 = 1.25 gev is about 700 @xmath37b and for @xmath20 induced @xmath6 production it is about 1300 @xmath37b .",
    "the latter contains not only the @xmath38 channel , but also the double - pionic fusion channel @xmath39 .    the only sizeable way two - pion production may feed the electron - pair production is via @xmath40 with the isovector @xmath6 pair being in relative @xmath41-wave ( @xmath5 channel ) .    in order to filter out the @xmath5-channel @xmath6 production from the known two - pion production cross sections , we make use of the isospin decomposition of these cross sections in terms of matrix elements @xmath42 , where @xmath43 stands for the isospin of the pion pair and @xmath44 and @xmath45 for the isospin of the nucleon pair in initial and final states , respectively @xcite .    for a specific process these matrix elements depend on the isospin coupling coefficients . for the @xmath8 process the matrix elements are proportional to the respective 9j - symbol for isospin recoupling : @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 couple to @xmath49 for @xmath50 and @xmath51",
