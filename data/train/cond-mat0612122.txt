    "semiclassical trajectory - based methods have long been applied to quantum chaos @xcite , however recent years have seen phenomenal progress in this field .",
    "the challenge of going beyond the berry diagonal approximation  @xcite has finally been overcome@xcite .",
    "some works@xcite have made progress towards a microscopic foundation for the well - established conjecture @xcite that hyperbolic chaotic systems have properties described by random matrix theory ( rmt ) .",
    "other works@xcite have explored the crossover from the rmt regime ( negligible ehrenfest time ) to the classical limit ( infinite ehrenfest time ) .",
    "most of the latter ( and some of the former ) works have dealt with mesoscopic effects in the quantum transport of electrons through open quantum dots with chaotic shape .",
    "they have analyzed the weak - localization correction to conductance and the resulting magneto - conductance @xcite , the shot - noise ( intrinsic quantum noise ) @xcite , and conductance fluctuations @xcite . however",
    "to - date all such works on quantum transport have assumed perfect coupling to the leads .",
    "the objective of this work is to consider quantum transport through a chaotic system that is coupled to the leads via tunnel - barriers ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cavity ] ) .",
    "such systems are experimentally realizable as large ballistic quantum dots@xcite .",
    "we study two properties of quantum transport , which highlight different aspects of the wave - nature of electrons .",
    "the first is the weak - localization correction to conductance , it is a contribution to conductance due to interference between electron - waves .",
    "it is destroyed by a weak - magnetic field , leading to a finite magneto - conductance .",
    "the second is the shot - noise , an intrinsically quantum part of the fluctuations of a non - equilibrium electronic current , it is due to the fact that different parts of the electron - wave can go to different places .",
    "if one assumes the chaotic system is well - described by a random matrix from the appropriate random matrix ensemble , then it is known how to calculate transport through a chaotic system coupled to leads via tunnel - barriers@xcite . under this assumption",
    "it has been shown that a cavity with two identical leads ( both with @xmath4 modes and with barriers with tunnelling probability @xmath5 ) , has a drude dimensionless conductance @xmath6 , while the weak - localization correction goes like @xmath7 .",
    "thus the weak localization correction goes to zero when we take @xmath8 , even when one keeps the drude conductance constant ( by taking @xmath9 such that @xmath10 remains constant ) .",
    "the formal nature of the rmt derivations have made it hard to give a simple physical explanation of why this suppression of weak - localization occurs .",
    "indeed the suppression seems counter - intuitive , since we know that in a chaotic ( ergodic and mixing ) system the details of the system dynamics have little effect on the transport properties .",
    "thus one would expect that transport through a lead with such tunnel - barriers should be equivalent to transport through a lead with @xmath11 modes without tunnel - barriers .",
    "this argument predicts the correct drude conductance , however it would lead one to predict _ incorrectly _ that the weak - localization correction is @xmath12 , instead of @xmath13 .",
    "the vanishing of weak - localization in the limit of strong tunnelling is intriguing because it shows that there can be competition between two of the most fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics : tunnelling and interference .",
    "one problem with the random matrix assumption is that it tells us nothing about the cross - over to the classical limit .",
    "the parameter which controls this crossover is the ratio of the ehrenfest time to a dwell time .",
    "the ehrenfest time ( first introduced into chaotic quantum transport in ref .  [ ] ) is given by the time it takes for a wavepacket which is well - localized in phase - space to gets stretched to a classical lengthscale . since the wavelength , @xmath14 , is much smaller than the system size , @xmath15 , the stretching is well approximated by the flow of the classical dynamics . in a hyperbolic chaotic system",
    "this stretching is exponential , and happens at a rate given by the lyapunov exponent , @xmath16 .",
    "it is convenient to define the ehrenfest time as twice the time for a minimal wavepacket ( spread by @xmath17 in position and @xmath18 in momentum ) to stretch to a classical scale . typically in open chaotic systems",
    "there are two classical scales , the system size @xmath15 , and the lead width @xmath19 ; there is an ehrenfest time associated with each scale@xcite , @xmath20 , \\\\",
    "{ \\tau_{\\rm e}^{\\rm op}}&= & \\lambda^{-1 } \\ln [ ( l/{\\lambda_{\\rm f}})(w / l)^2].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first we call the _ closed - cavity _ ehrenfest time since it is the only ehrenfest scale in a closed system , the second we call the _ open - cavity _ ehrenfest time , because it is associated with the opening of the leads",
    ". however we emphasis that both lengthscales ( @xmath15 and @xmath19 ) , and hence both ehrenfest times , are relevant to open cavities@xcite .    on times shorter than the ehrenfest times",
    "the dynamics of the system are not sufficiently mixing to give rmt results for transport quantities . in this article",
    "we address for the first time how tunnelling affects transport when a significant proportion of the current is carried by paths shorter than the ehrenfest times . to do this we must include the ray - splitting caused by such tunnel - barriers into the semiclassical trajectory - based method .",
    "we then investigate the effect of tunnelling on weak - localization and intrinsic quantum noise ( shot noise ) in a system with finite ehrenfest time .",
    "in addition to this we find that the method enables us to clearly see the physical mechanism by which tunnelling suppresses the weak - localization effects .",
    "the method presented here was used in ref .",
    "[ ] to investigate the effect of dephasing voltage probes on weak localization .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sect : qualitative ] contains qualitative explanations of the central results in this article ( particularly the suppression of weak - localization and ehrenfest - independence of the shot - noise in the opaque barrier limit ) .",
    "section [ sect : classical ] discusses the dynamics of the classical paths which are relevant for the semiclassical calculations .",
    "section [ sect : semiclass ] sets up the formalism for including tunnelling in the semiclassical trajectory - based method .",
    "sections [ sect : weak - loc ] and [ sect : noise ] then present calculations of the weak - localization correction to conductance and the fano factor of the shot - noise , respectively .",
    "as noted in @xcite for a system without tunnel - barriers , the coherent - backscattering approximately doubles the weight of all paths returning close and anti - parallel to the same path at injection .",
    "the approximate doubling of the weight applies to all paths that return to a strip defined by @xmath21 across the lead , where @xmath22 for a path that was initially injected at @xmath23 .",
    "this strip sits on the stable axis of the classical dynamics , with a width in the unstable direction of order @xmath24 .",
    "the probability for the particle to go anywhere else is slightly reduced ( by the weak - localization correction which is negative and @xmath21-independent ) , this ensures that the probability for the particle to go somewhere remains one ( preserving unitarity and conserving current ) .",
    "since the enhancement due to coherent - backscattering only occurs for reflection , we see that reflection is slightly enhanced and transmission ( and hence conductance ) is slightly reduced ; this is the weak - localization correction to conductance .",
    "however once we introduce tunnel - barriers the situation becomes more complicated .",
    "there is still the enhancement of paths that return to close and anti - parallel to themselves at injection , however there is no longer a guarantee that this enhancement contributes to reflection .",
    "the enhanced paths can return to the injection lead but then be reflected off the tunnel - barrier , remaining in the cavity ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : wl]c ) .",
    "these enhanced paths will then bounce in the cavity until they eventually transmit through a barrier , either contributing to transmission ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wl]c ) or reflection ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wl]c if we set @xmath25 ) .",
    "we use the term _ successful coherent - backscattering _ to refer to the the usual coherent - backscattering contribution , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wl]b , while using the term _ failed coherent - backscattering _ for those contributions which behave in the manner shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wl]c , d .",
    "thus the failed coherent - backscattering gives a positive contribution to both reflection and transmission which will tend to off - set the negative one coming from the usual weak - localization correction .",
    "this contribution will go like @xmath26 times the coherent - backscattering contribution in the absence of tunnel - barriers .",
    "this contribution will be `` smeared '' over all leads with a weight for each lead equal to the probability of escaping through that lead .",
    "so if the cavity has two identical leads , half of it will contribute to transmission and the other half to reflection .",
    "the successful coherent - backscattering goes like @xmath5 and only contributes to reflection .",
    "as we take @xmath8 we see that the coherent back - scattering becomes completely `` failed '' ( the successful part goes to zero ) .",
    "so the whole backscattering peak is smeared over all leads in exactly the same way as the conventional weak - localization correction .",
    "both have a weight for any given lead equal to the probability for the particle to escape through that lead .",
    "however the two have opposite signs ( which they must to preserve unitarity ) and thereby cancel .",
    "hence the total weak - localization correction ( sum of the conventional weak - localization correction , fig .",
    "[ fig : wl]a , and the failed coherent - backscattering , fig .",
    "[ fig : wl]c , d ) vanishes when we take @xmath8 ( even if we keep @xmath10 finite , so the drude conductance remains finite ) .      in all calculations in this article",
    "we find that the crossover from rmt behaviour ( zero ehrenfest time ) to classical behaviour ( infinite ehrenfest time ) is governed by the ratio of the ehrenfest time to the _ paired - paths _ survival time , not the _ single - path _ survival time ( the dwell time ) .",
    "the paired - paths survival time , defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : p2 ] ) , is the time during which a pair of initially identical classical paths both remain inside the cavity . under the classical dynamics of a closed cavity",
    "a pair of initially identical paths remain paired ( identical ) forever .",
    "however the presence of the leads means that all paths remain a finite time in the cavity , we call this the dwell time or single - path survival time , @xmath27 .",
    "further , if there are tunnel - barriers on the leads then the paired - paths survival time , @xmath28 , is given by the time for one or both of two ( initially identical ) paths to escape .",
    "we show that this time varies between @xmath27 for transparent barriers to @xmath29 for opaque barriers .",
    "the reason why @xmath28 is the relevant timescale for the suppression of the crossover is as follows .",
    "all paths which contribute to the rmt limit must involve an intersection at an angle of order @xmath30 , and the paths must the survive in the cavity until they spread to a distance apart of order the width of the lead on both sides of the intersection . within @xmath31 on either side of the intersection the paths are correlated , and so their joint survival probability decays at the rate @xmath32 .",
    "the shot noise contributions divide into those in which the paired - paths survive for a time less than @xmath33 and those which survive a time greater than @xmath33 .",
    "thus we see that these contributions go like @xmath34)$ ] and @xmath35 $ ] respectively .",
    "all weak - localization contributions require that the path segments diverge to a distance of order the system size on one side of the intersection ( so that a closed loop can form ) and to a distance of order the lead width on the other side ( when the `` legs '' can escape ) .",
    "thus the path segments must survive until a time @xmath36 on the loop - side of the intersection and @xmath33 on the leg - side .",
    "however within @xmath37 on both sides of the intersection , the paths have the paired - paths survival probability ( because they are closer than the lead width ) , while elsewhere each path segment individually has the single - path escape probability .",
    "thus we see that the exponential suppression of weak - localization for finite ehrenfest time goes like the survival probability for such paths of length @xmath38 which is @xmath39.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term in the exponent is the ehrenfest time dependence , the second term is a classical correction , since @xmath40 is independent of the particle wavelength . in the transparent barrier limit ( where @xmath41 ) the suppression goes like @xmath42 $ ] as found in ref .  [ ] , while in the opaque barrier limit we find @xmath43 so the suppression goes like @xmath44 $ ] .    in general the survival probability of such intersecting paths of total length @xmath45",
    "is @xmath46,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the paths are paired - during a time @xmath33 and unpaired at all other times ( when unpaired each segment decays at a rate of @xmath47 ) . in the transparent barrier limit",
    "this is @xmath48 $ ] while in the opaque barrier limit it is simply @xmath49 $ ] .      in the limit of opaque barriers ( small tunnelling rate )",
    "we find that the shot noise is independent of the ehrenfest time up to first order in @xmath5 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : fano - opaque2 ] ) .",
    "thus for any small @xmath5 , the magnitude of the difference between the noise in the rmt limit ( @xmath50 ) and the classical limit ( @xmath51 ) goes like @xmath52 , and thus may be beyond experimental resolution .",
    "this is despite the fact that the contributions in the rmt limit are very different from those in the classical limit .",
    "closer inspection shows that those contributions which survive in the opaque limit ( fig .",
    "[ fig : noise - trans1]e - i and fig .",
    "[ fig : noise - trans2]b - g ) do have one thing in common ; none of them have correlations between the paths when entering or exiting the cavity .",
    "thus it appears that it is irrelevant whether correlated paths have enough time to become uncorrelated inside the cavity ( as they do when @xmath53 , but not when @xmath54 ) because the tunnel - barriers destroy all correlations between paths ( the probability that both paths exit when they hit the tunnel - barrier is zero in this limit ) .",
    "it is intriguing that the shot noise is so insensitive to the manner in which correlations between paths are destroyed ( either via classical dynamics or via tunnelling ) .",
    "we note that for a symmetric two - lead system in the opaque limit ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) , the shot noise is half that for poissionian noise ( fano factor , @xmath57 ) .",
    "thus even through the transmission probability is small , so transmission is rare , the transmission is sub - poissonian process .",
    "the fermionic nature of the electrons induces correlations even in this limit .",
    "the result that @xmath57 , is the same as one would get for two leads coupled by a single tunnel - barrier with transmission probability equal to @xmath58 ( with no chaotic system present at all ) .",
    "in this article we consider a quantum system whose classical limit ( wavelength @xmath59 ) has a non - zero tunnelling probability at tunnel - barriers ( we assume the width of the barriers scales with @xmath60 ) .",
    "thus it is natural to include tunnelling at the level of the classical dynamics .",
    "here we introduce tunnelling into the classical dynamics phenomenologically , we will then see in section  [ sect : semiclass ] that it is the classical limit of the quantum problem we wish to solve .",
    "we assume that each time a classical path hits a barrier there is a probability of @xmath5 that the path goes through the barrier ( as if the barrier is absent ) and a probability of @xmath26 that the particle is specularly reflected ( as if the barrier is impenetrable ) .",
    "the probablistic nature of this tunnelling makes the classical dynamics _ stochastic_. the classical paths , which are the solutions of these stochastic dynamics , have properties not present in deterministic dynamics , such as bifurcations ( ray - splitting ) at the tunnel barriers ( one part transmitting and the other reflecting ) . to simplify the considerations in this article we consider tunnel - barriers that have a tunnelling probability which is independent of the angle , @xmath61 , at which a classical path hits the barrier .",
    "this assumption is justified for tunnel - barriers in the limit of large barrier height and small barrier thickness ( see appendix  [ sect : barrier ] ) .",
    "this is equivalent to saying we consider that the tunnel - barriers have the same tunnel probability for all lead modes .",
    "let us now consider the dynamics of a classical particle in such a system .",
    "we define @xmath62 such that the classical probability for a particle to go from an initial position and momentum angle of @xmath63 in the phase - space of lead @xmath64 ( a point on the cross - section of the lead just to the lead side of the tunnel - barrier ) to within @xmath65 of @xmath66 on the cross - section of lead @xmath67 ( again just to the lead side of the tunnel - barrier ) in a time within @xmath68 of @xmath69 is @xmath70 in a system _ without _ tunnel - barriers the classical dynamics are deterministic , and @xmath62 has a dirac @xmath71-function with unit weight on classical paths .",
    "however in a system _ with _ tunnel - barriers the classical dynamics are stochastic , with each barrier acting as a _ ray - splitter_. a classical path which hits a barrier is split into two ( one which passes through the barrier and one which reflects ) .",
    "thus , @xmath62 has a @xmath71-function on each classical path which exists ( counting all possible ray - splittings ) , however the weight of the dirac @xmath71-function is the product of the tunnelling / reflection probabilities that that path has acquired each time it has hit a tunnel - barrier .",
    "thus the integral of @xmath62 over all positions / momenta at escape , @xmath72 , gives a sum over all paths starting from @xmath73 in which each term is weighted by these tunnelling / reflection probabilities , hence @xmath74 _ { { \\bf y}_0 } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\sum_{\\gamma \\in \\{{\\bf y}_0\\ } } \\rho_m \\rho_{m_0 } { \\textstyle \\prod_{m ' } }   \\big[1-\\rho_{m'}\\big]^{n_\\gamma ( m ' ) }    \\ ; [ \\cdots]_\\gamma \\label{eq : integral - as - path - sum}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 , with @xmath76 integrated over the cross - section on each lead and @xmath61 integrated from @xmath77 to @xmath78 .",
    "the sum is over all possible path starting at @xmath79 .",
    "lead @xmath67 is defined as the lead the path finally escapes into , and @xmath80 is the number of times that the path @xmath81 reflects off the tunnel - barrier on lead @xmath82 before escaping .",
    "we assume that any quantities in @xmath83_\\gamma$ ] are independent of @xmath84 , in - other - words they are same as for the path which would exist if the tunnel - barriers were impenetrable for each reflection and absent for each tunnelling of path @xmath81 .    in semiclassics",
    "one is typically summing over all paths , @xmath81 , from @xmath85 to @xmath76 with energy , @xmath86 , rather than all paths starting at @xmath73 . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : integral - as - path - sum ] ) we see that this sum can be written in terms of @xmath62 as @xmath87^{n_\\gamma ( m ' ) }   \\ ; [ \\cdots]_\\gamma \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\int_0^\\infty { { \\rm d}}t \\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2 } { { \\rm d}}\\theta_0 { { \\rm d}}\\theta   \\left({{\\rm d}}y \\over { { \\rm d}}\\theta_0 \\right )   \\tilde{p}({\\bf y},{\\bf y}_0;t ) \\ ; [ \\cdots]_{{\\bf y}_0 } \\quad   \\label{eq : path - sum - as - integral}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the factor of @xmath88 comes from the change of integration variable from @xmath76 to @xmath89 .",
    "if we average , @xmath90 , over energy or an ensemble of similar chaotic systems , the average of @xmath62 will be a smooth function . if the system is mixing ( when the leads are absent ) and we perform sufficient averaging , we can assume the probability to go to any place in the cavity phase space is uniform . from this",
    "it immediately follows that the probability to go from a point in lead @xmath64 to anywhere in lead @xmath67 ( for @xmath91 ) is @xmath92 where @xmath72 is integrated over the cross - section of lead @xmath67 . to see this we simply note that the probability to enter the cavity from lead @xmath64 is @xmath93 , and the probability to escape the cavity is one .",
    "thus the probability to escape into lead @xmath67 is the ratio of @xmath94 to the sum of @xmath95 over all leads .",
    "note that in doing this we ignore all unsuccessful attempts to escape , thus the particle may have hit tunnel - barriers on the leads many times , but each time been reflected .",
    "the result in eq .",
    "( [ eq : average - trans - prob ] ) can also be derived by noting that the probability of hitting the tunnel - barrier on lead @xmath96 is @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the time of flight across the cavity , and then explicitly summing all reflections off the barriers .",
    "however we feel the above logic of ignoring all unsuccessful escape attempts gives the results in a direct and simpler manner , thus we use it throughout this article .",
    "following the same logic that leads to eq .",
    "( [ eq : average - trans - prob ] ) , we see that the survival probability of a single classical path which is inside the cavity is given by the master equation , @xmath99 where we define the single path dwell time as @xmath100 thus the probability to tunnel into the cavity from lead @xmath64 then escape into lead @xmath67 at position @xmath66 on the phase - space cross - section just to the lead side of the tunnel - barrier is @xmath101 \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : average - tildep}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now we turn to the evolution of a pair of almost identical paths . a quick glance at the figures in this article show that such pairs of paths ( vertically cross - hatched regions in figs .  [ fig : encounter]-[fig : noise - refl2 ] )",
    "are crucial to the quantities we calculate .",
    "this situation is different from the evolution of two very different paths , because here the two paths explore the same regions of the cavity s phase - space . thus if one path hits a tunnel - barrier then",
    "so will the other one .",
    "this leads to the definition of `` almost identical '' ; the paths must be a perpendicular distance apart that is less than the lead width for a significant period of time ( at least a few bounces ) , i.e. their difference in momenta is less than @xmath102 .",
    "( in principle two paths with very different momenta , will be `` almost identical '' very close to the points where they cross , however we ignore this as it will not significantly affect our calculations . )",
    "then when the pair of paths hit a tunnel - barrier the probability to survive ( probability for both paths to remain in the cavity ) is @xmath103 , this means the probability to _ not _ survive is @xmath104 .",
    "thus the survival probability of paired - paths is given by the master equation @xmath105 where we define the paired - paths survival time as @xmath106 note that this is the probability that both paths survive .",
    "since @xmath107 we see that @xmath108 , with @xmath41 when all tunnel - barriers are transparent ( @xmath109 for all @xmath67 ) , and @xmath43 in the limit of opaque barriers ( @xmath110 for all @xmath67 ) .",
    "unfortunately we can not write down an equation for the evolution of pairs of paths which is as simple as eq .",
    "( [ eq : average - tildep ] ) , because even under averaging the position / momentum of the second path in the pair are _ deterministically _ given by its initial position / momentum relative to the first path . assuming the system has locally uniform hyperbolic dynamics ( on lengthscales up to @xmath111 ) , then the dynamics of the second path in coordinates perpendicular to the first are @xmath112 where @xmath113 is a two - by - two matrix . for hamiltonian dynamics",

    "the semiclassical derivation of the drude conductance has become standard @xcite ( here we will broadly follow ref .  [ ] )",
    ". however we wish to introduce tunnelling into this derivation , this presents a difficulty since tunnelling can not be described in conventional semiclassics . to deal with this",
    "we follow a well - established procedure for dealing with a semiclassical system ( wavelength much less than other lengthscales ) in which there are isolated regions where semiclassics fails , see for example ref .",
    "we treat the regions where semiclassics fails in an exact manner ( or using an appropriate approximation scheme ) and then couple the propagators in those regions with the semiclassical ones in the regions where semiclassics works well .      before addressing the construction of an energy green s function which includes the tunnelling ,",
    "let us consider the case of a _ ray _ inside the cavity hitting the tunnel - barrier on one of the leads . a ray being a plane - wave multiplied by an envelope - function in the direction perpendicular to its motion which is much wider than @xmath60 , but much narrower than the classical scales , @xmath117 .",
    "in this case we can treat the scattering of the ray in the same manner as a plane - wave hitting the tunnel - barrier on a lead of infinite width .",
    "the equations for motion parallel and perpendicular to the barrier can be solved separately .",
    "the evolution perpendicular to the barrier is given by the solution of a textbook one - dimensional tunnelling problem ( see appendix  [ sect : barrier ] ) , while the evolution parallel to the barrier is unchanged by the presence of the barrier .",
    "the solution of the one - dimensional tunnelling problem tells us that for any given ray arriving at the tunnel - barrier , there will be two rays leaving the tunnel - barrier .",
    "one ray is that transmitted through the barrier , it has complex amplitude @xmath69 and has the same momentum as the incoming ray .",
    "the other ray is that reflected off the barrier , it has complex amplitude @xmath118 and has its momentum perpendicular to the barrier reversed ( specular reflection ) .",
    "thus each ray will be split into two each time it encounters a tunnel - barrier .",
    "of course the amplitude of the two new rays are such that @xmath119 .",
    "to fit with the classical model in section  [ sect : classical ] , we define @xmath120 .    for a very narrow barrier ( which is the only case we consider in this article ) these two rays are identical to the rays one would have if the barrier was both absent ( transmitted ray ) and impenetrable ( reflected ray ) , except that here the amplitude of the rays are multiplied by the complex amplitudes @xmath69 and @xmath118 respectively . for such narrow tunnel - barriers , the amplitudes @xmath69 and @xmath118 are independent of the angle , @xmath61 , of the incoming ray .",
    "now we must do the same for the energy green s function for propagating from @xmath121 in the l lead to @xmath118 in the r lead .",
    "we do this in a manner similar to ref .",
    "we first note that at large distances , @xmath122 , a semiclassical green s function , @xmath123 , is well approximated by a plane - wave in the vacinity of any given classical path .",
    "further for @xmath124 the differential equations for the green s function and a wavefunction are the same ( the schrdinger equation ) .",
    "thus we treat the semiclassical green s function in the vacinity of a given path which touches the tunnel barrier ( path @xmath125 ) , as a plane - wave or ray .",
    "we use this as the ingoing boundary condition on cross - section a ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : tunnel ] ) for the tunnelling / reflection problem .",
    "the tunnelling - reflection problem is solved using the standard method for wavefunctions ( see appendix  [ sect : barrier ] ) .",
    "the transmitted part gains a complex prefactor , @xmath69 , and then couples to the lead modes ( as in the case without tunnel barriers , we assume the leads are wide enough that they accept all momentum states ) .",
    "the reflected part gains a complex amplitude , @xmath118 , and is a plane - wave with its momentum perpendicular to the barrier reversed compared with the incoming plane - wave . treating this outgoing plane wave , at cross - section a , as a boundary - condition on the semiclassical evolution ,",
    "we see it couples to exactly the same paths as if the barrier was impenetrable .",
    "hence every tunnel - barrier couples each incoming path to two outgoing paths ( one as if the barrier was absent and one as if the barrier were impenetrable ) .",
    "if the weight on the incoming path is @xmath126 then the weight on the two outgoing paths will be @xmath127 and @xmath128 for transmisson and reflection at the barrier , respectively .",
