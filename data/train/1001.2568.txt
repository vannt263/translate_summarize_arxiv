    "the study of systems at the anderson metal - insulator transition ( mit ) has been a subject of intensive research activity for several decades .",
    "@xcite in particular , much interest has been focused on the scattering properties of critical systems by analysing the probability distribution functions of the resonance widths @xmath5 and wigner delay times @xmath6 ,  @xcite as well as the transmission or dimensionless conductance @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite the distribution functions of @xmath5 and @xmath6 have been shown to be related to the properties of the corresponding closed systems , i.e. , the fractality of the eigenstates and the critical features of the mit .",
    "on the other hand , at the mit , the distribution of conductances @xmath8 has been found to be _ universal _ ,",
    "i.e. , size independent , but dependent on the adopted model , dimensionality , symmetry , and even boundary conditions of the system .",
    "@xmath8 has been studied for systems in two and more dimensions with a large number of attached single - channel leads .",
    "@xcite in fact , concerning the conductance of one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems and its statistical distribution , the regime of small number of leads has been left almost unexplored .",
    "@xcite    in the present work we study numerically several statistical properties of the scattering matrix and the electronic transport across disordered systems in one and three dimensions described by the power - law banded random matrix ( pbrm ) model at criticality and the three - dimensional ( 3d ) anderson model at the mit , respectively .",
    "we stress that we concentrate on the case of a small number of attached leads each of them supporting one open channel .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the next subsection",
    "we define the pbrm model , the 3d anderson model , as well as the scattering setup .",
    "we also define the scattering quantities under investigation and provide the corresponding analytical predictions from random scattering - matrix theory ( rmt ) for systems with time - reversal symmetry .",
    "these analytical results will be used as a reference along the paper . in section",
    "ii we analyse the average scattering matrix elements , the conductance probability distribution , the variance of the conductance , and the shot noise power for the pbrm model as a function of its effective bandwidth @xmath0 . in section iii",
    "we compare the results of the pbrm model at criticality with the scattering and transport properties of the 3d anderson model .",
    "finally , section iv is left for conclusions .      as we have mentioned above , in the present study",
    "we adopt two models , namely , the pbrm model at criticality and the 3d anderson model at the mit .",
    "the pbrm model  @xcite describes 1d samples of length @xmath9 with random long - range hopping .",
    "this model is represented by @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) real symmetric matrices whose elements are statistically independent random variables drawn from a normal distribution with zero mean , @xmath12 , and a variance decaying as a power law @xmath13 , where @xmath0 and @xmath14 are parameters .",
    "there are two prescriptions for the variance of the pbrm model : the so - called non - periodic , @xmath15 where the 1d sample is in a _ line _ geometry ; and the periodic , @xmath16^{2\\alpha } } \\ , \\label{pbrmp}\\ ] ] where the sample is in a _ ring _ geometry .",
    "field - theoretical considerations  @xcite and detailed numerical investigations  @xcite have verified that the pbrm model undergoes a transition at @xmath17 from localized states for @xmath18 to delocalized states for @xmath19 .",
    "this transition shows all the key features of the anderson mit , including multifractality of eigenfunctions and non - trivial spectral statistics at the critical point .",
    "thus the pbrm model possesses a line of critical points @xmath20 .",
    "we set @xmath17 in our study , i.e. , we work with the pbrm model at criticality .    the 3d anderson model with diagonal disorder is described by the tight - binding hamiltonian ( tbh ) @xmath21 labels all the @xmath22 sites of a cubic lattice with linear size @xmath9 , while the second sum is taken over all nearest - neighbour pairs @xmath23 on the lattice .",
    "the on - site potentials @xmath24 for @xmath25 are independent random variables .",
    "when @xmath24 are gaussian distributed , with zero mean and variance @xmath26 , the mit at energy @xmath27 occurs for @xmath28 . see refs .",
    "[ ] . then , for @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) the system is in the metallic ( insulating ) regime .",
    "we set @xmath31 in our study .",
    "we open the isolated samples , defined above by the pbrm model and the 3d anderson model , by attaching @xmath32 semi - infinite single channel leads .",
    "each lead is described by the 1d semi - infinite tbh @xmath33    using standard methods  @xcite one can write the scattering matrix ( @xmath34-matrix ) in the form  @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the @xmath37 unit matrix , @xmath38 is the wave vector supported in the leads , and @xmath39 is an effective non - hermitian hamiltonian given by @xmath40 here , @xmath41 is an @xmath42 matrix that specifies the positions of the attached leads to the sample .",
    "its elements are equal to zero or @xmath43 , where @xmath43 is the coupling strength .",
    "moreover , assuming that the wave vector @xmath44 do not change significantly in the centre of the band , we set @xmath45 and neglect the energy dependence of @xmath46 and @xmath34 .      notice from eqs .",
    "( [ pbrmnp]-[pbrmp ] ) that in the limit @xmath3 the pbrm model reproduces the gaussian orthogonal ensemble .",
    "therefore , in that limit we expect the statistics of the scattering matrix , eq .  ( [ smatrix ] ) , to be determined by the circular orthogonal ensemble ( coe ) which is the appropriate ensemble for systems with time reversal symmetry .",
    "thus , below , we provide the statistical results for the average @xmath34-matrix and the transport quantities to be analysed in the following sections , assuming the orthogonal symmetry .",
    "in all cases , we also assume the absence of direct processes , i.e. , @xmath47 .",
    "we start with the average of the @xmath34-matrix elements .",
    "it is known that @xmath48 where @xmath49 means ensemble average over the coe .    within a scattering approach to the electronic transport ,",
    "once the scattering matrix is known one can compute the dimensionless conductance @xmath50 and its distribution @xmath8 . for @xmath51 ,",
    "i.e. , considering two single - channels leads attached to the sample , @xmath8 is given by @xmath52 while for @xmath53 , @xmath54 for arbitrary @xmath55 , the predictions for the average value of @xmath7 and its variance are @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively .",
    "for the derivation of the expressions above see for example ref .",
    "another transport quantity of interest is the shot noise power @xmath58 , which as a function of @xmath55 reads  @xcite @xmath59    in the following sections we focus on @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 for the pbrm model and the 3d anderson model , both at the mit . in all cases we set the coupling strength @xmath43 such that @xmath64 in order to compare our results , in the proper limits , with the rmt predictions introduced above .",
    "we attach the @xmath32 leads to the first @xmath32 sites of the 1d sample described by the pbrm model .",
    "that is , in the non - periodic version of the pbrm model , eq .",
    "( [ pbrmnp ] ) , we attach the leads at the _ boundary _ of the system .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ setup](a ) . while in the periodic version , eq .  ( [ pbrmp ] ) , we attach them to the _",
    "bulk_. see fig .  [ setup](b ) . in the latter case ,",
    "finite size effects are considerably reduced .",
    "however , the quantities we analyse below are @xmath9-independent once @xmath9 is much larger than the number of attached leads for both versions of the pbrm model .",
    "we point out that our setup is significantly different from the one used in refs .",
    "[ ] , where the conductance has also been studied using the pbrm model . there , for example , the leads in the @xmath51 case are attached to sites which are separated a distance of @xmath65 and @xmath9 in the periodic and non - periodic versions of the pbrm model , respectively .",
    "in such situation the scattering quantities are strongly @xmath9-dependent .",
