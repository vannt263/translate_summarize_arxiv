    "interactions amongst hadrons may be sufficiently strong to produce bound states  this picture even emerges naturally when starting from a quark model  @xcite . famous examples of those are nuclei , but also amongst mesons a large number of states were recently identified as candidates for hadronic molecules .",
    "however , only if one channel is largely dominant and the ( quasi)bound  state poles are located close to the corresponding continuum threshold for the constituents that form the molecule through an @xmath5wave interaction  @xcite or if the @xmath6 behavior of the system can be controlled  @xcite , a model independent access to the nature of the state appears to be possible . on the other hand",
    "there is a large number of proposed molecular states , where neither of the mentioned criteria applies . in this case",
    "it needs to be demonstrated that the molecular picture describes the properties of the states better than , say , a conventional quark  model description .",
    "this might emerge , e.g. , since the pattern of su(3)flavor breaking turns out to be different for hadron ",
    "hadron states , due to the different analytic structure of their scattering amplitudes . in this paper",
    "we discuss observables that might qualify for such a test for the possible molecular nature of the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath4 , and @xmath3 .",
    "the reactions we will focus on are decays of the @xmath0 .",
    "the decays of @xmath0 into a vector meson @xmath7 or @xmath8 and two pseudoscalars , including their non - perturbative final state interactions driven by the presence of the scalar mesons @xmath9 and @xmath10 , were studied recently in refs .",
    "these processes proceed through an ozi violating strong interaction and it was assumed that the transition @xmath11 provides a scalar source term allowing for an investigation of scalar form factors ( for corrections induced by the interaction of the pseudoscalars with the vector meson see refs .",
    "analogous to the decay modes mentioned above are the modes @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "these decays were recently studied in ref .",
    "@xcite following similar steps as done in refs .",
    "@xcite , within the scheme where these tensor states are dynamically generated from the interaction of pairs of vector mesons .",
    "indeed , in ref .  @xcite it was shown that the @xmath1 and @xmath3 states appear naturally as bound states of @xmath15 using the interaction kernel provided by the hidden gauge lagrangians @xcite .",
    "an extension to su(3 ) of the former work of ref .",
    "@xcite done in ref .",
    "@xcite , studying the interaction of pairs of vectors , shows that there are as many as 11 states dynamically generated , some of which can be associated to known resonances , namely the @xmath16 and @xmath17 resonances , as well as the @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in this paper",
    "we investigate the same @xmath0 decays together with their radiative counterparts and make predictions for ratios of decay rates for the mentioned molecular picture and a naive quark model assignment .",
    "radiative decays . ]",
    "two topologies are possible for the radiative decays of the @xmath0 into light hadrons , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] . since the photon carries both an isospin 1 and an isospin 0 component , the hadronic final state for the mechanism of diagram @xmath18 can have an admixture of both isospins . in diagram",
    "@xmath19 , on the other hand , also after the photon emission , the isospin of the @xmath20 pair is still zero and correspondingly the isospin of the hadronic final state is zero .",
    "since at the charm quark mass @xmath21 is about @xmath22 , relatively small , and diagram @xmath18 involves an additional loop , diagram @xmath19 is expected to be the dominant process  @xcite and we therefore may assume the radiative @xmath0 decays as a source for isoscalar light hadrons .",
    "this is also confirmed by data  @xcite .",
    "more than this , under the dominance of diagram ( a ) , the state after the radiation is still a @xmath23 and hence an su(3 ) singlet , which is relevant for the present study .",
    "decay into a photon and one dynamically generated resonance . ]    we now need to calculate the formation of the resonances .",
    "this calculation depends on the assumed nature of the states . in this section",
    "we will discuss the rates that emerge in a molecular picture for the mentioned resonances  namely they are assumed to emerge from the non - perturbative interactions of vector mesons amongst themselves .",
    "we readily get the su(3 ) singlet combination of two vectors from @xmath24,\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the su(3 ) matrix of the vector mesons @xmath26 we , thus , find the vertex @xmath27 one then projects this combination over the vv states which are the building blocks of the resonance produced , with unitary normalization ( an extra factor @xmath28 for identical particles or symmetrized ones ) and phase convention @xmath29 , @xmath30 of isospin , @xmath31 : @xmath32 note that these weights are just su(3 ) symmetry coefficients , and they are obtained with the momentum - independent approximation of the production vertices , which is valid since the mass differences among the vector mesons are small .",
    "decay into a photon and one dynamically generated resonance . ]",
    "the next step consists in producing dynamically the resonance r which is shown diagrammatically in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] . then in the @xmath33 decay we naturally have a process as shown in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] such that the part of the @xmath34 amplitude is then given by the process shown in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] , where the vv loop stands for the vv propagator , or @xmath35 function , which appears in the scattering amplitude for two vectors @xmath36 with @xmath37 the vv potential . in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] one also has the couplings , @xmath38 , of the resonance r to the different vv intermediate states , which are calculated and tabulated in ref .",
    "altogether the amplitude for @xmath39 is proportional to @xmath40 the resonance decay vertices do not appear in this expression , since they are irrelevant for the discussion below , which focuses on inclusive observables . is often identified in a specific decay channel , say @xmath41 for the @xmath3 , the @xmath42 decay is reconstructed by dividing by the branching ratio of r to this channel .",
    "thus , the whole inclusive @xmath43 decay is obtained and this is what we calculate by means of the @xmath44-matrix of eq .",

    "note that the main component of the @xmath1 and @xmath3 ( @xmath46 and @xmath4 ) is the @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) pair , and the interference between the @xmath47 and @xmath48 is constructive ( destructive ) for the @xmath1 and @xmath3 ( @xmath46 and @xmath4 ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for inclusive resonance production the partial decay widths are given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the photon momentum in the @xmath0 rest system .",
    "for simplicity we here assume that the final phase space can be calculated with the nominal resonance mass . a more refined study would call for a proper folding with the resonance mass distribution ( recall that this folding for the intermediate vv states is already done in ref .",
    "while this is relevant when one has decays close to the threshold of the final state , in the present case there is plenty of phase space for the @xmath34 decay and the folding barely changes the results calculated at the central value of the resonance mass distribution .",
    "the most difficult part of this study is the determination of the uncertainties .",
    "since there is no proper effective field theory underlying this study , we need to estimate the uncertainties of the model via the uncertainties of the input quantities .",
    "the model used has 5 subtraction constants as parameters in the strangeness - zero channels  @xcite .",
    "they were all demanded to take natural values , however , two of them were tuned a bit to get the masses of the tensor ",
    "mesons in agreement with data . in order to determine the uncertainties of the result",
    "we now vary all parameters independently : we produced a large number of results emerging from calculations with different subtraction constants under the constraint that the masses of the tensor mesons still are reproduced .",
    "in addition the vector coupling constant was varied within its 10 % uncertainty . from this study a 95 % confidence level could be determined .",
    "the corresponding results that we get within the molecular picture are shown in the first column in table ii and compared with the experimental data when available  @xcite .",
    "please note that the uncertainty of the super  ratio @xmath51 is considerably lower , since the uncertainties in @xmath52 and @xmath53 are correlated .",
    "we can see that we obtain a band of values perfectly compatible with the experimental data for the ratio of rates of @xmath0 to @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "we get a central value of 2 for this ratio .",
    "as we will show below , the quark model prediction for this quantity , assuming that the resonances belong to the same flavor nonet , is similar .",
    "in addition to the tensor channel the model also makes predictions for the ratio of the decay rates to the two scalar states @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which are also dynamically generated in the approach of ref .",
    "the central value obtained is about 1.2 for the ratio of the decay rates to @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "one can trace this smaller value now , with respect to the case of the tensors , to a less efficient cancellation between @xmath58 and @xmath47 in the case of the @xmath4 compared to the @xmath46 , where the @xmath47 coupling has also opposite sign to that of @xmath58 .",
    "the su(3 ) flavor content of the tensor and scalar resonances is similar within the model employed : @xmath3 and @xmath1 are mostly @xmath47 molecules , while @xmath4 and @xmath2 are mostly @xmath58 molecules .",
    "yet , the nontrivial dynamics of the coupled channels and the potentials @xmath37 of the hidden - gauge approach tend to produce a factor of two difference in the ratios of the decay rates of @xmath0 into states with similar flavor contents , although the uncertainties between the two ratios still overlap",
    ".    however , since the uncertainty of the super - ratio @xmath51 is smaller , the difference between 0.6 in the case of the molecular picture and the value around unity in the quark model picture to be discussed below , within their uncertainties , are quite distinct . certainly the measurement of the ratio of decays to the scalar mesons should be a valuable piece of information to further test the nature of the resonances under consideration .    in the case of scalar mesons the intermediate pseudoscalar pairs ( they are in l=0 for the scalar mesons ) in the sum of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mat ] ) could provide some contribution .",
    "we find the most extreme case for the @xmath3 , where the combination of @xmath59 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mat ] ) for @xmath41 might be of the same order of magnitude as for the @xmath47 component , however , almost purely imaginary , so that there is no interference with the @xmath47 contribution .",
    "one must then rely upon the weighs @xmath60 to decide the relative size of the @xmath41 and @xmath47 contribution .",
    "the limited information from the pdg ( see rates @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 ) indicate that the rates for @xmath64 might be about one order of magnitude larger than for @xmath65  @xcite , so one can induce a smaller contribution of intermediate pions , but this limited experimental information should translate into larger uncertainties in the @xmath52 ratio of table [ table : ratio ] , of the order of an additional 10 - 20 % .",
    "please note that for the decay modes @xmath66 , @xmath13 and @xmath67 , estimated within the same molecular picture as used in this section , a good agreement with the data was achieved  @xcite  see fig .",
    "[ f5 ] . in the next section",
    "we shall discuss the corresponding predictions for all the channels mentioned within an admittedly naive quark model .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the ratio of rates , @xmath53 , obtained in table ii is related to the dominance of the strange components in @xmath2 and the nonstrange ones in @xmath1 . in a simple @xmath68 model for these states",
    "one assumes that they belong to a nonet of tensor mesons , which includes the @xmath17  @xcite . certainly , in a quark model mixing between the su(3 ) singlet @xmath69 and su(3 ) octet isoscalar @xmath70 is allowed . since the mass difference between the @xmath1 and the @xmath46 is approximately the same as that between the @xmath8 and the @xmath7 , we may assume ideal mixing between them , i.e. , the @xmath1 corresponds to @xmath71 , the @xmath46 to @xmath72 ( see footnote and @xmath2 , see , e.g. , refs",
    ".  @xcite . ] ) .",
    "the su(3 ) singlet combination is now given by @xmath73 which provides a branching ratio @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the momenta of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the @xmath0 rest frame .",
    "this number is comparable to the one obtained in the molecular model discussed in the previous section , where the @xmath1 is mostly @xmath47 and the @xmath2 is mostly @xmath58 . a fully dynamical quark model calculation for the mentioned transitions , e.g. along the lines of refs .",
    "@xcite , where the strong decays of the @xmath1 and the @xmath46 are well - described in the @xmath77 quark model , would be most welcome .",
    "analogous flavor counting arguments provide values between 2.2 and 2.5 for the ratio @xmath52 of table ii , depending on the masses used for the scalar states , which is considerably higher than the value found within the molecular model .",
    "there are similar transitions that can be studied within the same framework , namely the ratios between the @xmath0 decays into @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 . within the molecular model of the previous section those were studied in ref .",

    "contrary to the case of the tensor mesons , in the molecular model , the amplitude from the dominant component only gets a small correction from non - trivial interference with the other components for both the @xmath3 and the @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , the corrections for these two scalars are similar , @xmath119 is 9% for the @xmath3 , and 6% for the @xmath4 ( using the numbers given in table [ table : sum ] ) . as a result ,",
    "the value of @xmath52 is approximately 1 in the molecular model , which differs from that in the quark model .",
    "we must mention that the current version of the pdg review  @xcite quotes the observation of the @xmath4 in three @xmath0 radiative decay modes , i.e. , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 , while no clear @xmath3 has been seen in these data .",
    "this , at first sight , seems to contradict the results in both the molecular model ( @xmath123 ) and the quark model ( @xmath124 ) .",

    "for instance , in the molecular model used here the @xmath3 couples only very weakly to both @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "thus , the non - observation of this state in the @xmath127 and @xmath128 decay modes of the @xmath0 decays should be of no surprise in that model . on the other hand , since in that model the @xmath3 couples much more strongly to @xmath41 than the @xmath4 does , it seems mysterious that in the @xmath129 data  @xcite only the @xmath4 is seen but not the @xmath3 .",
    "a possible explanation is that the scalar state peaking at @xmath130 mev with a width of @xmath131 mev  @xcite might not be the same as the @xmath4 observed in the @xmath132 .",
    "this conjecture is supported by the fact that the @xmath4 branching fractions to @xmath41 and @xmath125 obtained from @xmath133 data  @xcite and @xmath134 data  @xcite , @xmath135 and @xmath136 at 95% confidence level , respectively , are not consistent with each other , which indicates that the states observed in these two sets of data might indeed be different . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath4 in the molecular picture has a branching ratio @xmath137 at a few percentage level  @xcite , consistent with the @xmath4 observed in @xmath138  @xcite .    the new analysis of the bes ii @xmath139 data  @xcite , which updates the analyses of the mark iii  @xcite and bes data  @xcite , claims that the scalar state around @xmath140 gev is the @xmath141 , which is also seen in @xmath142  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 is also definitely needed to fit the data , while no @xmath4 is necessary .",
    "the observations are consistent with the molecular picture for the @xmath4 and @xmath3 . indeed ,",
    "since in the molecular model the ratio @xmath143 is about 1 and the @xmath3 couples more strongly to @xmath47 than the @xmath4 does , one would naively expect to see more @xmath3 than @xmath4 in @xmath144 .",
    "the study of scalar mesons between 1 and 2 gev has always been complicated by possible mixing with nearby glueballs , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein . things might become more subtle if there exists an extra scalar state , the @xmath141 , in addition to the @xmath3 , @xmath145 , and @xmath4 . in the molecular picture of ref .",

    "@xcite . in that paper",
    ", it is suggested that the @xmath145 has a large glueball component while the @xmath3 and @xmath4 have relatively small glueball components .",
    "certainly , one should keep in mind that the @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the molecular model are dynamically generated states from vector meson - vector meson interactions while those in ref .",
    "@xcite are considered as mainly @xmath68 states , and hence , one should not expect the same mixing pattern in these two pictures .",
    "we have carried out an evaluation of the ratios of the rates for the @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 , and @xmath149 decays .",
    "the ratios were estimated either using a molecular model , where all the mentioned states emerge as bound states or resonances of two vector mesons , as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , or using a simple quark model .",
    "the results obtained for the ratio of the rates in the production of the tensor mesons is in good agreement with experiment for both approaches .",
    "we then make predictions for the ratio of rates for @xmath0 decays into the scalar mesons , which could be tested in the future .",
    "we also compare the predictions of the molecular model for @xmath0 decays into @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath83 and together with the mentioned resonances  @xcite to those from the same quark model . here the molecular picture can describe the decay ratios well , while the results from the simplified quark model are consistent with the data only within two sigma .",
    "improved data are desirable to draw more firm conclusions .",
    "in addition , a corresponding dynamical quark model calculation  including estimates of uncertainties , which was not possible in the simplified quark model used here  would be very important for the @xmath0 decays discussed in this paper in order to better understand the nature of the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath4 , and @xmath3 .",
