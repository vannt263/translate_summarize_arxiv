    "in 2008 the paul scherrer institut ( psi ) celebrated its 20@xmath0 anniversary and many years of delivering high intensity muon beams . several upgrades made the 590 mev/51 mhz ring cyclotron to be up to today the most powerful proton accelerator of its kind in the world , which delivers several 10@xmath1 muons per second to experiments .",
    "the accelerator runs now routinely with 2.0 ma proton current and was already pushed to 2.15 ma for tests . in the near future running at 2.3 ma is foreseen , and an extensive program was launched to boost the operating proton current to 2.6 ma , by 2011 , and ultimately to 3.0 ma , envisaged for 2012 @xcite .",
    "precision experiments should benefit from a correspondingly increased muon intensity .",
    "charged lepton - flavor conservation has been empirically verified to a high precision , but is not a consequence of a known underlying symmetry . the decay @xmath3 is lepton - flavor violating and hence , excluding neutrino flavor mixing , forbidden within the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "neutrino masses and mixing , which is established now , introduce a contribution to this decay within the sm , however , on an unmeasurably small level of order @xmath410@xmath5 @xcite . on the other hand , there are several attractive theories beyond the sm , such as supersymmetry , which generally predict lepton - flavor - violating processes at a level within today s experimental reach",
    ". a corresponding experimental signal would be free of sm background and hence a clear indication for ` new physics ' .",
    "the goal of the meg experiment at psi @xcite is to reach a sensitivity of 10@xmath6 , improving the present limit @xcite by almost 2 orders of magnitude .",
    "consequently one needs a detector managing a challenging high muon stop rate up to @xmath7 muons / s .",
    "the experimental principle is based on the simultaneous detection of the back - to - back emitted mono - energetic decay positron and gamma .",
    "the positrons are detected in high rate drift - chambers located in a magnetic field for momentum determination and in scintillation counters for timing .",
    "the gammas are detected in the world s largest liquid xenon scintillation counter , as sketched in fig.[meg - apparatus ] .",
    "excellent timing , energy and spatial resolution for both reaction products are required to beat the main background caused by ordinary muon decay and pile - up .",
    "2008 saw the first months of physics run of meg and the accumulated statistics looks promising to already improve the present limit on @xmath3 significantly .",
    "the fermi constant @xmath8 describes the strength of the charged - current weak interaction . along with the fine structure constant @xmath9 and the @xmath10-boson mass , it is one of the three pillars of the electroweak standard model and directly related to the electroweak gauge coupling @xcite .",
    "the most precise determination of @xmath8 is based on the mean lifetime of the positive muon , @xmath11 , and can be extracted from : @xmath12 with @xmath13 representing higher order qed and hadronic corrections as well as finite - lepton - mass phase space factors , which have only recently been computed to a sub - ppm level @xcite . a first computation of order @xmath14 using a finite electron mass shifted the value of @xmath13 by another 0.43ppm @xcite . hence , a comparably precise experimental determination of @xmath11 is highly desirable .",
    "the mulan experiment @xcite installed a muon beam kicker on the pie3 beamline at psi , which allows after directing positive muons onto a target for a selectable time period ( e.g. 5 @xmath15s ) , to steer away the beam for the following , for instance , 22 @xmath15s , the decay positrons are recorded in a soccer - ball shaped detector ( see fig.[mu - lifetime - plot]b ) made from 170 double - layer scintillator tiles , which are read out via custom - made 500 mhz fadc modules able to separate pulse pile - up events on the ns level .",
    "systematic issues , caused by positron detection differences in the counters , due to polarized muons precessing in the earth s magnetic field , are dealt with via measurements in different targets , which are in a homogeneous magnetic field and either fully maintain the muon polarization ( silver ) , depolarize the muons to a large extent ( sulphur ) , or cause a very fast muon precession due to an internal few tesla high magnetic field ( arnokrome@xmath16-iii ) .",
    "several 10@xmath17 muon decays were recorded for each target .",
    "the first mulan result , based on part of the data has set a new precision benchmark , as shown in fig.[mu - lifetime - plot]a .",
    "additionally , several dedicated systematic measurements are presently under analysis .",
    "the final precision goal on @xmath11 is 1ppm , which translates into a 0.5ppm precision on @xmath8 .",
    "the fast experiment @xcite relies on the detection of the full decay sequence @xmath18 and corresponding times in a fast imaging target made of 32 x 48 pixels , constructed from plastic scintillator bars in a homogeneous b field .",
    "this approach allows a good control of muon polarization effects .",
    "fast is scheduled to achieve a statistics of several @xmath19 in 2008/2009 .",
    "its goal is a 2ppm measurement of @xmath11 .",
    "as a by - product , fast can also measure the @xmath20 lifetime and improve the present world average .",
    "the determination of the proton s weak pseudoscalar coupling constant @xmath21 has been the driving force behind decades of muon capture measurements . the psi result on the muon capture rate in @xmath22he @xcite has set a precision landmark in this field .",
    "however , with 3 involved nucleons some questions still remained in the precise theoretical prediction .",
    "a specially exciting turn came with the precise triumf results from a measurement of radiative muon capture ( rmc ) in hydrogen @xcite , which disagreed with theory and results derived from ordinary muon capture ( omc ) measurements @xcite , as shown in fig.[gp - plot]a .",
    "after decades of worldwide experimental efforts , the mucap experiment has achieved the first unambiguous determination of the proton s pseudoscalar coupling @xmath21 @xcite and has solved a longstanding discrepancy .",
    "the result is in excellent agreement with recent calculations based on heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hbchpt ) @xcite .",
    "experimental determinations of @xmath21 depend on the ortho - para transition rate @xmath23 in the @xmath24 molecule .",
    "the most precise previous measurement of ordinary muon capture ( omc ) @xcite and the rmc experiment @xcite both depend significantly on the value of @xmath23 , which itself is poorly known due to mutually inconsistent experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite results . in contrast , the first mucap result for @xmath21@xcite is almost independent of molecular effects .    sc/@xmath15pc - muon entrance counters , tpc - time projection chamber = target , epc , esc - electron tracking and timing counters.__,title=\"fig : \" ]    the mucap result was only possible with an enduring joint effort and a rigorous experimental technique @xcite . the setup is shown in fig.[gp - plot]b",
    ". the active target , a time projection chamber , was filled with 10 bar of ultra - pure ( high @xmath10 contamination in the few ppb range ) and isotopically pure hydrogen @xcite .",
    "muon stops and corresponding decay electron tracks were recorded in 3 dimensions , which allowed for very selective cuts and hence an unprecedented control and possible study of systematic effects .",
    "specifically , muon capture events on high @xmath10 elements are even on the ppb contamination level visible in the mucap detector .",
    "target conditions were selected in order to control effects due to muonic molecule formation and muon catalyzed fusion .",
    "the muon capture rate was finally determined by comparing the lifetime of negative muons in hydrogen with the positive muon lifetime from the more precise result @xcite . in order to extract @xmath21 ,",
    "the singlet muon capture rate was compared to two recent calculations @xcite adding the newly calculated radiative correction @xcite . presently",
    ", the full data set of more than 10@xmath25 recorded @xmath26 stops in hydrogen is being analyzed in a blind analysis , with the final precision goal of 1@xmath27 on the singlet muon capture rate in hydrogen .",
    "20 s@xmath28 to the total rate .",
    "b ) estimations on the axial two - body current term @xmath29 .",
    "all methods up to now include certain assumptions and approximations which might be questioned .",
    "all references are given in @xcite _",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    knowing @xmath21 from mucap facilitates the interpretation of the doublet muon capture rate on the deuteron ( @xmath30 ) , the measurement goal of the recently started musun experiment @xcite which also aims at 1@xmath27 precision .",
    "such a result would allow a precise test of modern effective field theories and would represent the most stringent test of electro - weak interaction in a two - body system @xcite .",
    "moreover , it would allow determination of the axial two - body current term which scales with the low energy constant denoted @xmath29 ( or d@xmath31 ) @xcite .",
    "this parameter is of astrophysical interest , as it appears in the same form in the cross - section for i ) muon capture on the deuteron , ii ) @xmath32 fusion  the main fusion reaction in the sun , and iii ) neutrino - deuteron reactions , which are the detection reactions used by the sudbury neutrino observatory @xcite .",
    "hence , via the absolute neutrino rates , the precise @xmath15d capture rate determination would ` calibrate ' the sun .",
    "existing experimental results on @xmath30 are not precise enough ( fig.[l1a - plot]a ) and also using other sources leaves the present experimental knowledge on @xmath29 rather sparse , as shown in fig.[l1a - plot]b . with precision neutrino physics on the horizon",
    "the precise knowledge of @xmath29 will be necessary , as it also influences the determination of @xmath33 and @xmath34@xcite .",
    "the experimental principle of musun will follow the successful mucap approach , but for control and optimization of muonic molecule formation and muon catalyzed fusion reactions in deuterium one has to use a high density cryo - target at @xmath430k @xcite .",
    "@xmath35 fusion reactions occur at much higher rates than muon capture and hence represent a severe background , but also allow to monitor the hyperfine populations of the muonic atom @xcite .",
    "high @xmath10 target purity will be even more critical as in mucap . in a first engineering run a new pad - based tpc",
    "was successfully tested with high purity deuterium in late 2008 .",
    "there are several other precision measurements of fundamental parameters ongoing or under discussion at psi , which either will test the standard model or search for new physics .",
    "*   the muonic lamb - shift experiment @xcite is preparing for its first physics data taking in 2009 , and wants to precisely determine the proton charge radius via observation of the 2p-2s energy difference in muonic hydrogen . *   a precise test of the electron - muon universality",
    "is being performed within the pen experiment and corresponding data are being analyzed @xcite .",
    "*   the search for the lepton - flavor - violating process @xmath36 would be a sensitive search for new physics and complement the present meg activity .",
    "there is an ongoing discussion on 2 suggested experimental approaches , how to obtain a sensitivity which improves the present experimental limit by roughly 3 orders of magnitude @xcite . *   a sensitive search for a cp violating muon electric dipole moment ( edm ) was suggested in @xcite using a compact storage ring , which could make use of psi s high muon intensity and reach a sensitivity of 5@xmath3710@xmath38 e@xmath39 cm . in this way",
    "it would test ` new physics ' and pave the way for higher sensitivity tests of muon and other charged particle edms . *   the discussion about dark matter and dark energy",
    "has also put interest in particles decaying into mirror worlds , other dimensions or to other branes .",
    "hence the decay products would be invisible .",
    "a search for the invisible decay of muons was suggested in @xcite , and might be also searched for by using the mucap setup . *",
    "high brightness muon beams would also allow a first test of the gravitational interaction of antimatter of a purely leptonic system , which involves second generation particles , namely muonium ( @xmath40 ) @xcite .    given these and more ideas",
    ", one can be sure that precision measurements using muons , at psi and other facilities in the world , will also in future contribute to a deeper understanding and testing of the standard model and provide a fair chance to first find ` new physics ' beyond our presently accepted theory .",
