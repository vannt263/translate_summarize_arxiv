    "multiple scattering of waves in random media has been an active area of research for about hundred years . of special interest",
    "is the role of interferences between different multiple scattering paths . for a long time",
    ", it was believed that all interferences are destroyed by the disorder , such that the propagation of the average intensity follows a simple diffusion process .",
    "but in 1958 , anderson showed that interference effects can lead to a localization of wavefunctions in certain random lattices , corresponding to a complete suppression of diffusion @xcite .",
    "later , it was recognized that even in weakly scattering media , interferences between amplitudes propagating along reversed scattering paths may survive the ensemble average @xcite , leading to the phenomena of weak localization ( reduction of the diffusion constant ) and coherent backscattering ( enhancement of the average intensity scattered into the direction exactly opposite to the incident wave ) @xcite .    whereas these mesoscopic physics effects have been thoroughly studied for the case of linear wave equations , important , yet unresolved questions concern the impact of interactions or nonlinearities on the multiple scattering interferences .",
    "for example , does anderson localization still persist in the presence of nonlinearities ?",
    "good candidates for studying these questions appear to be bose - einstein condensates in disordered potentials @xcite . in the mean field regime ,",
    "the condensate is still described by a single coherent wave function following a nonlinear wave equation ( gross - pitaevskii equation ) .",
    "thus , the coherence of the condensate is preserved in presence of ( not too strong ) interactions .",
    "similar nonlinear equations also describe propagation of light in disordered nonlinear media @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the situation is quite different in the case of electronic transport @xcite , where the interactions combined with finite temperature effects give rise to dephasing mechanisms , which in general destroy the disorder - induced coherent effects .    as an important step in the theoretical description of coherent effects in nonlinear disordered systems , a theory for coherent backscattering in presence of nonlinearity",
    "has recently been developed @xcite .",
    "most importantly , it has been shown that the usual picture of coherent backscattering resulting from interference between pairs of only two counterpropagating amplitudes breaks down in the nonlinear regime . as a consequence of nonlinear coupling between different partial waves ,",
    "nonlinear coherent backscattering must rather be interpreted as a multi - wave interference phenomenon @xcite .",
    "this fundamental property was not taken into account in earlier works @xcite , which therefore concluded that nonlinearity would leave the enhancement factor in exact backscattering direction unchanged with respect to the linear case - in contradiction to our results presented below .",
    "the present paper provides a complete and detailed presentation of the diagrammatic theory sketched in @xcite , which fully takes into account the multi - wave interference character of nonlinear coherent backscattering . to perform the disorder average",
    ", we will define nonlinear ladder and crossed diagrams , which describe diffusive transport and coherent backscattering of the average wave intensity in the dilute regime @xmath0 ( with wavenumber @xmath1 and mean free path @xmath2 ) .",
    "we are able to sum up the diagrammatic series completely , i.e. nonperturbatively in the strength of the nonlinearity . as final result",
    ", we will see that even very weak nonlinearities do significantly affect the coherent backscattering enhancement factor , which , depending on the type of nonlinearity , may be either enhanced or reduced , as compared to the linear case .",
    "these predictions of our theory agree with recent numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ setup ] , we describe the general conditions under which the nonlinear diagrammatic theory can be applied . in short ,",
    "these are the following : first , we consider a nonlinear equation for the complex wave amplitude @xmath3 , which we assume to possess a unique stationary and stable solution . in order to perform the disorder average ,",
    "we require , second , the disordered medium to be dilute .",
    "finally , we neglect nonlinear effects which become relevant only at larger values of the nonlinearity .    in the present paper",
    ", we will develop our theory on the basis of two different physical models , corresponding to homogeneous or discrete nonlinearity , respectively . in sec .",
    "[ moddiag ] , we start by considering the discrete case , i.e. a collection of nonlinear point scatterers placed at random positions . we obtain the formal solution of the wave equation as a nonlinear born series , and introduce diagrams representing the individual terms of this series .",
    "furthermore , we identify certain types of diagrams ( ladder and crossed diagrams ) which survive the disorder average over the random positions of scatterers .    among these",
    ", the ladder diagrams describe incoherent nonlinear transport of the average wave intensity .",
    "this is the subject of sec .",
    "[ sladder ] .",
    "we analyze the statistical fluctuations of the wave intensity ( which influence the average intensity , since the nonlinearity couples different statistical moments ) , define refractive indices for scattered and incident waves , and finally arrive at a set of nonlinear integral equations for the average intensity inside the scattering volume .    in sec .",
    "[ scrossed ] , we analyze the crossed diagrams , which describe the coherent backscattering effect as interferential correction to incoherent transport .",
    "we identify the building blocks for the nonlinear crossed diagrams , and point out the rules according to which these elements are connected to each other .",
    "this leads us to integral equations for the crossed intensity , which finally determine the coherent backscattering enhancement factor .",
    "we will discuss under which conditions the nonlinearity reduces or enhances the coherent backscattering effect , as compared to the linear case .    in sec .",
    "[ skerr ] , we consider a second physical model , namely a disordered collection of linear scatterers embedded into a homogeneous nonlinear kerr medium .",
    "equivalently , the same equation also describes bose - einstein condensates in disordered potentials ( gross - pitaevskii equation ) . for this model ,",
    "our theory can be applied in almost the same way as for the nonlinear scatterer model - in particular , the finally obtained average transport equations turn out to have the same form .",
    "we solve these equations numerically for different values of the kerr nonlinearity constant @xmath4 , and thereby confirm the general considerations of sec .",
    "[ scrossed ] .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ concl ] concludes the paper .",
    "some more technical calculations are relegated to two appendices .",
    "[ sctrans ] contains the complete set of crossed transport equations , as they result from the exact summation of all crossed diagrams . in app .",
    "[ proofrel2 ] , we prove a general relation between diffuson and cooperon cross section , which is useful in order to determine whether the nonlinearity decreases or enhances the coherent backscattering effect .",
    "in this section , we will expose the general assumptions which we will need in secs .",
    "[ moddiag]-[scrossed ] for developing the nonlinear diagrammatic theory .",
    "first , we assume that our system is described by a complex wave function @xmath5 , which fulfills a nonlinear random wave equation .",
    "furthermore , we assume that , for ( almost ) any realization of the disorder , the field @xmath6 approaches , for @xmath7 , a stationary state of the form @xmath8 , where the frequency @xmath9 is determined by the external , monochromatic source .",
    "whereas for a linear system , this assumption implies no loss of generality , since the time - dependent behavior for arbitrary ( non - monochromatic ) sources follows simply by fourier transformation with respect to @xmath9 , the same is not true in the nonlinear case . for example",
    ", it has been shown that solutions of the nonlinear gross - pitaevskii equation exhibit permanently time - dependent behavior even if the external source is purely monochromatic @xcite . for a system of finite size",
    ", however , we expect the assumption of a monochromatic stationary solution to be valid if the nonlinearity is small enough , and if generation of higher harmonics can be neglected .",
    "using the language of nonlinear optics , the latter condition implies that all nonlinear susceptibilities of even order ( i.e. @xmath10 , @xmath11 ,  ) , which appear for noncentrosymmetric media @xcite , vanish .",
    "apart from that , the polarizability of the nonlinear medium may be an arbitrary function of the local intensity @xmath12 .",
    "under these conditions , the field @xmath3 fulfills a stationary , nonlinear wave equation , see for example eq .",
    "( [ model1 ] ) or eq .",
    "( [ hom ] ) below .",
    "this wave equation will serve as the starting point for our diagrammatic theory , see sec .",
    "[ moddiag ] .",
    "let us note however , that the diagrammatic theory in its present form is not able to predict the maximum strength of the nonlinearity up to which the stationary assumption remains valid .",
    "this must be checked by alternative methods , for example direct numerical simulations . for the case of the homogeneous kerr nonlinearity ,",
    "( [ hom ] ) , a theoretical prediction of the instability threshold was performed in @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations for nonlinear point scatterers @xcite and the 2d gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite indicate that , in these cases , the instability threshold is large enough such that important nonlinear effects ( i.e. modification or even inversion of the coherent backscattering effect ) are observed in the stable regime , for which our theory applies .",
    "the second assumption required for our diagrammatic theory is the validity of a dilute medium approximation .",
    "when calculating the average scattered intensity , this assumption allows us to discard all diagrams except so - called ladder and crossed diagrams . from the ladder diagrams ,",
    "we then obtain the diffuse background of the average scattered intensity , whereas the crossed diagrams yield the interference contribution leading to coherent backscattering . in the linear case ,",
    "this dilute medium approximation is known to be valid if @xmath0 , i.e. if the mean free path @xmath2 is much larger than the wavelength @xmath13 divided by @xmath14 .",
    "we now assume the phase randomization mechanism , which makes it possible to neglect all diagrams except ladder and crossed diagrams , to be equally effective also in the nonlinear case . in sec .",
    "[ sdiag ] , we will then define nonlinear generalizations of ladder and crossed diagrams , which we sum up in order to obtain nonlinear transport equations , see secs .",
    "[ sladder ] and [ scrossed ] .",
    "we note that , in principle , the dilute medium condition @xmath0 might be modified by the presence of the nonlinearity .",
    "this must be checked for the specific model under consideration .",
    "for example , it can be shown that the diagrams describing scattering processes induced by the nonlinear index fluctuations @xmath15 in the case of the homogeneous kerr nonlinearity , see eq .",
    "( [ hom ] ) , are neither of ladder nor crossed type . since these processes depend on the strength @xmath4 of the nonlinearity , the condition @xmath0 alone is not sufficient to guarantee their negligibility . instead , an additional assumption for @xmath4 is required , see sec .",
    "[ smodel2 ] . on the other hand , for the nonlinear point scatterer model , see sec .",
    "[ smodel1 ] , where the nonlinearity is concentrated inside the scatterers , we expect the diluteness condition to be fulfilled for arbitrary strength of the nonlinearity , if the average distance between the scatterers is large enough .",
    "finally , our last assumption concerns the neglect of nonlinear self - action effects ( self - focusing , filamentation , ... ) originating from the intensity - dependent refractive index @xcite .",
    "we assume those effects to be negligible on the length scale of the mean free path @xmath2 .",
    "more precisely , we approximate the optical path between two scattering events at @xmath16 and @xmath17 , with @xmath18 , by a straight line , see eq .",
    "( [ green ] ) , which also means that the spherical geometry of field radiated by a point source is preserved .",
    "this is justified if the intensity - dependent refractive index @xmath19 varies slowly on the length scale @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath20 . in principle , these effects could be taken into account within the diagrammatic approach .",
    "the determination of the exact optical path required for this purpose , however , would enormously increase the computational effort .    in summary ,",
    "all the three above general conditions for the applicability of our diagrammatic approach are fulfilled in the case of dilute media and weak nonlinearity .",
    "let us stress , however , that our approach is nevertheless non - perturbative in the strength @xmath4 of the nonlinearity . as we will see later",
    ", even a very weak nonlinearity can have a large impact on the final result ( i.e. the height of the coherent backscattering cone ) , if the size of the system ( optical thickness ) is large . in order to access the regime where perturbative expansions in powers of @xmath4 do not rapidly converge ( even if @xmath4 is small ) , we will therefore have to sum up our diagrammatic series completely , without restriction to certain orders of @xmath4 .",
    "in sec .  [ setup ] , we have discussed general conditions for our diagrammatic approach . in order to present the theory in a concrete form , we now specify the nonlinear wave equation under consideration , and define a concrete model for the disorder .    in this paper , we will consider the following two physical models : a collection of nonlinear point scatterers , see sec .",
    "[ smodel1 ] , and a collection of linear scatterers embedded in a homogeneous kerr medium , see sec .",
    "[ smodel2 ] . in the second model ,",
    "the kerr nonlinearity induces an intensity - dependent refractive index , which modifies the average wave propagation between two linear scattering events .",
    "similarly , also in the first model , the nonlinear point scatterers form an effective nonlinear medium , but - in addition to that - also the scattering events are nonlinear . in this sense ,",
    "the nonlinear point scatterer model is the more general one , and we will therefore use it as our starting point for the diagrammatic derivation of nonlinear transport equations . the modifications necessary for the homogeneous nonlinearity will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ smodel2 ] .",
    "we consider an assembly of @xmath21 point - like scatterers located at randomly chosen positions @xmath22 , @xmath23 inside a sample volume @xmath24 illuminated by a plane wave @xmath25 .",
    "we assume the field radiated by each scatterer to be a nonlinear function @xmath26 of the local field @xmath27 .",
    "since we neglect higher harmonics , the radiated field must attain the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the local intensity , and @xmath30 is proportional to the polarizability of the scatterers , which may be an arbitrary ( smooth ) function of @xmath31 .",
    "this results in a set of nonlinear equations for the field at each scatterer : @xmath32 where @xmath33 with @xmath34 , denotes the vacuum green s function .",
    "note that the incident plane wave is normalized to unit intensity , which can always be achieved by a suitable redefinition of @xmath30 .",
    "in the case of conservative scatterers , the optical theorem imposes the following condition : @xmath35 which has a general solution of the form @xmath36 with phase shift @xmath37 .",
    "let us note , however , that our diagrammatic approach is valid for arbitrary polarizability @xmath30 .",
    "hence , we will also consider amplifying or absorbing scatterers in the following , where eqs .",
    "( [ optth],[gcons ] ) are not fulfilled .",

    "our aim is to calculate the mean scattered intensity @xmath45 , averaged over the random positions of scatterers . for this purpose ,",
    "we employ a method based on the diagrammatic representation of the iterative solution of the nonlinear multiple scattering equations ( [ model1 ] ) .      first ,",
    "let us examine a single event , described by the function @xmath46 .",
    "expanding the polarizability @xmath47 in a fourier series , we obtain the following sum over the order @xmath48 of the nonlinearity : @xmath49 the terms of this sum are represented by diagrams like fig .  [ single ] , which shows , as an example , @xmath50 for @xmath51 and @xmath52 for @xmath53 .    ,",

    "the reader should simply imagine that every single event ( @xmath67 or @xmath68 ) occurs at some given scatterer @xmath73 .",
    "it may be that two events occur at the same scatterer - only neighboring squares ( which are connected by a single arrow ) must correspond to different scatterers , since only couplings @xmath58 between different scatterers @xmath74 occur in eq .",

    "( repeated scattering by the same scatterer is already included in the polarizability function @xmath75 ) .",
    "we note that the diagrammatic representation of the nonlinear born series has already been examined in a previous article @xcite ( for the special case of a @xmath76-nonlinearity ) , which , however , does not make use of the dilute medium approximation , as we do in the following .",
    "[ sscrossed ]    next , we consider diagrams for the detected intensity @xmath77 , see eq .",

    "( in other directions @xmath83 , this is still true for the ladder , but not for the crossed diagrams . )",
    "this disappearance of phase factors is achieved by grouping together solid and dashed arrows , such that for each vacuum green s function @xmath58 there exists a corresponding @xmath69 or @xmath84 which cancels the phase factor . since @xmath85 ( reciprocity symmetry )",

    "[ sscatt ] ) occur at scatterer 1 , 2 , 5 , and 7 , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 form a pair , whereas scatterer 3 , 4 , and 6 contribute to average propagation ( see sec .  [ sindex ] ) .",
    "[ ladder],width=302 ]    here , we adopt the convention that two squares ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) drawn next to each other correspond to the same scatterer @xmath73 ( thus forming a scattering event at @xmath73 , see below ) , whereas all other events occur at different scatterers @xmath88 .",
    "hence , the diagram shown in fig .  [ ladder ] involves @xmath89 different scatterers .",
    "moreover , since the ladder diagrams describe the average intensity , an integration over the positions @xmath90 of the scatterers is implicitly assumed .",
    "thus , the example shown in fig .",
    "[ ladder ] represents the following expression : @xmath91 where @xmath92 denotes the density of scatterers .",
    "note that the phase factors @xmath93 representing the waves incident on scatterers 1 and 7 , and the waves @xmath94 emitted from scatterer 5 cancel each other , and are hence not included in eq .",
    "( [ ladderexample ] ) .    the example shown in fig .",
    "[ ladder ] is also useful to understand the difference between scattering events for the average intensity , on the one hand , and events contributing to average field propagation , on the other hand .",

    "in contrast to the ladder diagrams , the two finally outgoing arrows originate from two different scatterers . between those two scatterers ,",

    "this property is a consequence of the reciprocity symmetry . unlike for the linear case , however , it does not imply that , in total , the crossed and ladder contributions to the backscattering signal are identical .",
    "the reason is that , in general , a nonlinear ladder diagram has more than one crossed counterpart .",
    "[ crossed ] , for example , just shows one of several different ways of reversing the scattering paths of fig .",
    "[ ladder ] . indeed , reversing the direction of arrows in all possible ways ( consistent with the general structure of nonlinear field diagrams ,",

    "this yields in total 2 different ladder and 7 different crossed diagrams , whose value ( for @xmath82 ) is identical to eq .",
    "( [ ladderexample ] ) . hence , unlike to the linear case , nonlinear coherent backscattering does not originate from interference between only two waves propagating along reversed scattering paths , but must be described as a multi - wave interference phenomenon .",
    "for this reason , the nonlinear crossed contribution can not simply be extracted from the ladder intensity by employing the reciprocity symmetry , but must be calculated separately . in the following two sections , we will show how the ladder and crossed diagrammatic series can be summed up into a closed form , thereby obtaining nonlinear transport equations for the ladder and crossed intensities .",
