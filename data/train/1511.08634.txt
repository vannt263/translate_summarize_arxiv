    "in metals with face - centered cubic structure , dislocations can dissociate into two shockley partial dislocations connected by a faulted ribbon .",
    "the most often observed fault is the intrinsic stacking fault ( isf ) . assuming infinite separation between the two partials , an ideal isf is obtained by removing a single close packed fcc ( 111 ) layer from the perfect fcc matrix .",
    "the stacking fault energy @xmath0 ( sfe ) is the excess energy needed to form an isf .",
    "sfe has been recognized as an important parameter controlling the mechanical properties of fcc metals and alloys .",
    "the magnitude of the sfe determines the width of the partial dislocations and thus is of primary importance in many aspects of plasticity related to the dislocation mediated behaviors .",
    "the twining induced plasticity ( twip ) mechanism has been associated with the sfe . according to semi - empirical correlations , @xcite small sfe favors twinning , whereas large sfe leads to narrowly dissociated or undissociated dislocations and thus dislocation glide is favored . very small or negative",
    "sfe is known to be responsible for the transformation induced plasticity ( trip ) mechanism .",
    "the critical sfe values separating the trip / twip / slip regimes in engineering alloys vary significantly .",
    "@xcite one possible reason behind these uncertainties is the typical large errors associated with the available sfe data .",
    "the stacking fault energy is an intrinsic material property that can in principle be measured by carefully designed experiments .",
    "however , being a very small energy ( usually of order of 10 - 100 mjm@xmath1 ) the accurate determination is very difficult and the reported experimental data often carries very large error bars .",
    "@xcite during the last decades several theoretical methods have been developed and employed in establishing more reliable sfe databases .",
    "a very powerful method is based on thermodynamic approach . in the popular model proposed by olson and cohen @xcite (",
    "also named as volumetric model ) , the stacking fault is treated as a two - layers embryo with the hexagonal close packed structure embedded in the fcc matrix .",
    "accordingly , the sfe of an infinitely large stacking fault may formally be expressed as    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the difference in gibbs free energies of equilibrium hcp and fcc phases , @xmath4 is the molar surface density ( mol m@xmath1 ) of the ( 111 ) atomic layer .",
    "@xmath5 is usually considered as the fcc / hcp interfacial energy and the @xmath6 term in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) accounts for the two interfaces between the hcp embryo and the fcc matrix .",
    "this interfacial energy may however differ significantly from the coherent fcc / hcp interfacial energy ( @xmath7 ) since in the above model of the stacking fault the hcp embryo has only two layers and the two fcc / hcp interfaces are likely to interact with each other .",
    "additionally , in the thermodynamic calculations , hcp phase is often assumed at equilibrium state , while in the coherent interface calculations , the hcp structure may have a quite different c / a due to the coherent strain . in that respect , in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) all differences between the true stacking fault and the `` embryo '' model are included in the interfacial energy @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite because of that in the following we refer to @xmath8 as the pseudo - interfacial energy to distinguish it from the true coherent interfacial energy @xmath7 of fcc / hcp .",
    "no direct measurements of @xmath8 are available . instead , various efforts have been put forward to estimate @xmath8 indirectly via eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) utilizing the measured sfe . for homogeneous fe - cr - ni alloys , olson and cohen  @xcite using the calculated gibbs free energies and the measured stacking fault energies  @xcite found @xmath9 mjm@xmath1 .",
    "recently , pierce _ et al . _",
    "@xcite measured the compositional dependence of the stacking fault energy of fe - mn based alloys ( fe-22/25/28mn-3al-3si wt.% ) and calculated @xmath8 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) using the thermodynamic gibbs energies .",
    "they showed that @xmath8 ranges form 8 to 12 mj m@xmath1 in fe - mn - al - si alloys and from 15 to 33 mj m@xmath1 in binary fe - mn alloys .",
    "it was emphasized that @xmath8 exhibits a strong dependence on the difference in gibbs energies of the fcc and hcp phases . in particular , the gibbs energy of the hcp phase , which has no precise description due to its thermodynamical instability , significantly influences the estimated @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite in practice , the pseudo - interfacial energy in thermodynamic calculations is often treated as an adjustable parameter to bring the theoretical sfe values in line with the observed deformation mechanisms .",
    "@xcite because of these difficulties , the effectiveness of the thermodynamic sfe models is limited .    _",
    "ab initio _ quantum mechanical modeling is an alternative approach to determine the sfe .",
    "recently , it was employed to study the sfe in transition metal alloys and stainless steels.@xcite first - principles methods were also used to compute the interfacial energies . following the volumetric model , one can increase the thickness of the hcp layers embedded in the fcc matrix from 2 , corresponding to one isf , to @xmath10 describing @xmath11 consecutive stacking faults or equivalently two fcc / hcp interfaces separating the fcc and hcp parts of the layered system .",
    "a similar model was recently adopted by rosalie _",
    "_ , when studying the fcc / hcp phase interface in al - ag - cu alloys .",
    "@xcite to the first order approximation , whether an atomic layer belongs to fcc or hcp phase depends on the stacking sequences of its two nearest neighboring layers .",
    "namely , a layer having the two nearest neighbors with identical stacking sequence belongs to the hcp phase , otherwise it belongs to the fcc phase .",
    "this is illustrated schematically in figure  [ schematic1 ] . in panel",
    "( a ) , showing the situation for @xmath12 , we have marked the positions of the hcp / fcc interfaces when the system is considered as an hcp embryo embedded in fcc phase ; and the position of stacking fault when the system is considered as fcc phase with one stacking fault .",
    "at the interfaces there are critical layers ( marked by asterisk ) which might erroneously be considered as belonging to the hcp phase . however ,",
    "these layers have two different nearest neighbor layers ( corresponding to local fcc packing ) and thus should not be taken as being energetically equivalent to the hcp layers .  @xcite lee _",
    "recently calculated the interfacial energy of fcc fe(111)/hcp fe(0001 ) using _ ab initio _ methods .",
    "@xcite they obtained an unreasonable interfacial energy ( -241 mj m@xmath1 ) compared to the commonly cited values ( 5 - 27 mj m@xmath1 ) .",
    "however , carefully examining their interfacial structure , one finds that they placed the hcp / fcc interface at `` ...",
    "abcabc@xmath13abab ... '' instead of the correct position `` ...",
    "abcabca@xmath13bab ... ''",
    ". therefore one fcc layer was erroneously taken as hcp layer , which resulted in the calculated `` interfacial energy '' containing an additional energy difference between the fcc and hcp phases scaled by the interface area @xmath14 , i.e. , @xmath15 .",
    "the above analysis is solely based on the stacking sequence from the structural point of view .",
    "there is no composition difference between the two sides of the interface . in cases where the composition of the precipitate deviates from that of the matrix",
    ", it may look straightforward to define the phase interface as the composition interface .",
    "however , the situation could be more complicated , such as in the case of the hcp / fcc interface in al - ag alloys .",
    "recent study showed that for precipitates with thickness of 1 - 3 stacking faults , the thickness of the ag - enriched region is considerably wider than the size of the hcp region indicating that the phase interface is more likely a structural interface in the ag - enriched alloys . for precipitates with @xmath16 stacking faults , the ag - enriched zone was approximately equal to the width of the hcp region , indicating that the interface is a combination of structural and compositional interfaces .",
    "@xcite the interphase energies of hcp / fcc interfaces in ag - al alloys were studied by finkenstadt _",
    "_ to understand the large aspect ratio experimentally found for hcp precipitates .",

    "we employ an _ ab initio _ total energy method that can account for alloying effects , so that the approach can easily be extended to solid solutions .",
    "our approach avoids the ambiguous alloying configuration that might lead to segregation or partitioning .",
    "we calculate the interface energies for pure fcc metals ( al , ni , cu , ag , pt and au ) and a few fe - cr - ni alloys which represent the main building block of austenitic stainless steels . the coherent interfacial energy is calculated with respect to the number of hcp layers and the pseudo - interfacial energy is calculated according to the thermodynamic expression for sfe ( eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) ) using the calculated sfe values by the supercell model .",
    "we demonstrate that there is a significant difference between the true and the pseudo - hcp / fcc interfacial energies .",
    "the large discrepancies originate from the actual definitions based on different reference structures .",
    "the rest of the paper is divided into two main sections and a conclusion . in section [ method ]",
    ", we introduce the models used for calculating the interfacial energies and give the calculation details .",
    "the results are presented and discussed in section [ results ] .",
    "the paper ends with conclusions .",
    "in the present work , we employ two methods for calculating the stacking fault energy and the interfacial energy of the fcc(111)/hcp(0001 ) interface .",
    "the first method is based on a supercell model and provides a direct access to the interfacial energy as a function of layer thickness .",
    "the second approach maps the total energy into layer - layer interaction parameters offering a more straightforward insight into the mechanisms governing the interfacial energy in metals and alloys .",
    "this latter approach may be related to the thermodynamic model for calculating the sfe .      to calculate the coherent interfacial energy ,",
    "we build a series of supercells containing fcc / hcp interfaces with various number of fcc ( 111 ) and hcp ( 0001 ) layers .",
    "the supercells are denoted by _ _",
    "m__fcc+__n__hcp or @xmath17 , where _ m _ and _",
    "n _ are the numbers of fcc and hcp layers respectively .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are applied . considering the real situation that the lateral lattice constants are set up by fcc matrix ,",
    "the stacking fault layers or hcp structure are distorted to form coherency with the fcc lattice .",
    "hence , when there is a sizable difference between the equilibrium volumes of the fcc and hcp structures or the equilibrium hcp lattice has @xmath18 far away from the ideal value ( @xmath19 ) , the embedded hcp layers in the supercells will be distorted ( the interlayer distance being different from the equilibrium value ( @xmath20 ) ) .",
    "we therefore first relax the hcp structure with the constrain of @xmath21 ( @xmath22 being the fcc lattice parameter ) and find the interlayer distance @xmath23 .",
    "then the interlayer distances for `` bulk hcp '' inside the supercell ( @xmath23 ) , except the topmost ones ( @xmath24 ) which are the closest to the fcc / hcp interface , are fixed to @xmath25 .",
    "the interlayer distances between the fcc(111 ) layers are kept as the equilibrium values , @xmath26 .",
    "the topmost hcp interlayer distance @xmath24 and the interface separation between the fcc and hcp parts of the supercell @xmath27 were relaxed ( see below ) .    using the total energy @xmath28 of the _",
    "_ m__fcc+__n__hcp supercell , the interfacial energy may be calculated as    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the equilibrium total energy of the fcc lattice ( per atom ) .",
    "@xmath31 is the total energy of the constrained hcp lattice ( per atom ) , which usually is larger than the actual equilibrium hcp energy @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33 is the area of interface and the factor of 2 stands for the two interfaces present in the supercell . for a large enough @xmath34 ,",
    "the interfacial energy should converge with increasing @xmath11 towards a constant value representing the coherent fcc / hcp phase interface energy ( @xmath7 ) .    for @xmath35 ,",
    "the interfacial energy is obviously zero . for @xmath12 ,",
    "the supercell has two hcp layers which can also be viewed as one intrinsic stacking fault .",
    "hence , the intrinsic stacking fault energy may be computed from the present @xmath36 supercell energy as    @xmath37    with increasing fcc layer thickness @xmath38 the above sfe converges to the true sfe @xmath0 .    in the present application ,",
    "the number of fcc layers was chosen to be 9 ( @xmath39 ) which was found to be large enough to remove the interaction due to the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the number of hcp layers , on the other hand , was increased from 0 to 8 with an increment of 2 .",
    "the interfacial energy is usually a very small quantity and it is very sensitive to the numerical details used in the _ ab initio _ calculations . in order to keep the numerical noises at minimum , the fcc energy entering eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) was calculated from the energy of 9fcc+0hcp supercell as @xmath40 .",
    "the energy of the distorted hcp phase was evaluated from the difference between the total energies of the @xmath41 and @xmath42 supercells , @xmath43/2 $ ] .",
    "we notice that computing @xmath31 from the @xmath41 and @xmath44 supercells leads to very similar results as those presented here .",
    "we studied the effect of relaxation of the interface separation between the fcc and hcp parts of the supercell @xmath27 and found that the fully relaxed layer separation is very close to the average value of the interlayer separations of fcc(111 ) and hcp(0001 ) layers .",
    "therefore , in order to reduce the computational load , for all supercells we used @xmath45 . we also noticed that relaxing the topmost hcp interlayer distance @xmath24 is important especially when @xmath11 is small .",

    "@xmath46 may take two possible values : + 1 if the layer at site ( @xmath47 + 1 ) follows the ideal fcc stacking sequence , else a value of @xmath481 is assigned .",
    "thus , the energy of a structure with a particular stacking sequence can be expanded as    @xmath49    where the sums run over the atomic layers .",
