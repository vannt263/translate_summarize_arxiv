    "the iaea uses an ensemble of procedures and technologies , collectively referred to as the safeguards regime , to detect diversion of fissile materials from civil nuclear fuel cycle facilities into weapons programs .",
    "the research described here concerns safeguards for one important element of this cycle , nuclear reactors . earlier work  @xcite has described a method for exploiting the large number ( @xmath0/s ) of antineutrinos emitted by fission reactors to track the plutonium content and thermal power of the reactor core in real time .",
    "this approach offers unique advantages that are complimentary to existing safeguards methods .",
    "the potential impact on the regime is large , inasmuch as over @xmath1 of the world s civil power reactors , located in some @xmath2 countries , are subject to iaea safeguards  @xcite .",
    "to be useful for reactor safeguards , antineutrino detectors must be simpler to construct and operate than the current generation of detectors , which were built to investigate the basic physics of the neutrino sector .",
    "it is in this respect that this work differs from the experimental effort described in  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , an experimental deployment at a commercial reactor is essential to demonstrate the potential of this technology to the global non - proliferation community .    in this paper",
    ", we describe the characteristics and performance of such a device ; a simple , compact prototype antineutrino detector , `` songs1 '' , which has been installed at a commercial nuclear power station to demonstrate the feasibility of this monitoring technique .",
    "in the context of nuclear nonproliferation , cooperative monitoring refers to the tracking of nuclear inventories and nuclear facilities with the agreement of the host country .",
    "the iaea safeguards regime is the most prominent example of such monitoring .",
    "antineutrinos have unique features that make them interesting for the purpose of cooperative monitoring of nuclear reactors .",
    "the highly penetrating nature of the particle and the high flux near reactors means that relatively small detectors external to the reactor can acquire a signal useful for monitoring , even with hour to day integration times .",
    "furthermore , over a broad range of antineutrino energies , the ratio of antineutrinos per fission and mev emitted by uranium and plutonium varies by factors of @xmath3@xmath4  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "as uranium is consumed and plutonium produced in the core , the measured antineutrino rate and spectrum will change , providing up to date information about the burnup and isotopic content of the core .",
    "for example , during a typical @xmath5@xmath6  year cycle at a pressurized water reactor ( pwr ) , the net effect on the antineutrino rate due to the fissile isotopic evolution is @xmath7@xmath8 .",
    "information about the reactor s fissile content is a key element of the iaea safeguards regime , whose purpose is to detect unauthorized diversion of fissile material from civil nuclear fuel cycles .",
    "antineutrino detectors can supply this information in real time and in a manner wholly under the control of the safeguards agent , without interfering with daily reactor operations . because of these interesting features , antineutrino detection holds promise as a complementary technique for iaea and other reactor safeguards regimes .      in neutrino physics experiments that require an absolute flux or spectral measurement , considerable effort must be devoted to a full understanding of the absolute efficiency of the detector . in safeguards regimes ,",
    "both relative and absolute measurements may be of use .",
    "relative measurements , in which the antineutrino rate or spectrum is compared to some initial value , are insensitive to time - independent systematic shifts in the detector response , such as an error in an estimate of the detection efficiency . for such measurements ,",
    "a detailed understanding of the individual detector s efficiency is therefore not required , so long as the detector response is stable in time . in the analysis presented here ,",
    "we have estimated the efficiency of the songs1 detector using a simple detector simulation .",
    "we emphasize that the potential utility of the detector for safeguards does not depend on a precise knowledge of this efficiency .",
    "the songs1 detector is deployed at unit 2 of the san onofre nuclear generating station ( songs ) .",
    "there are two operational reactors at this station ; both are pressurized water reactors designed by combustion engineering in the 1970s and have maximum thermal ( electric ) power of @xmath9  gw@xmath10 ( @xmath11  gw@xmath12 ) .    the detector is located in the tendon gallery of unit  2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : songs ] ) . a feature of many commercial reactors  @xcite , a tendon gallery is an annular concrete hall that lies beneath the walls of the reactor containment structure .",
    "it is used to inspect and adjust the tension in reinforcing steel cables which extend throughout the concrete of the containment structure . at songs",
    "these inspections occur every two to three years , and involve the examination of only a handful of representative tendons .",
    "subsequently , the placement of the detector in the tendon gallery has little or no impact on regular plant operations .",
    "songs1 is located @xmath13  m from the unit  2 reactor core and @xmath14  m from that of unit 3 . since the antineutrino flux generated by each core is isotropic ,",
    "@xmath15% of the reactor antineutrinos reaching the songs1 detector originate from unit  2 . with unit  2 at full power the antineutrino flux at the songs1 location is @xmath16m@xmath17s@xmath18 .",
    "it is worth noting that at this position the flux of other particles , in particular fast neutrons and gamma rays , reaching the detector from the reactor core is practically zero .",
    "for example , the material between the core and the detector corresponds to nearly @xmath19  attenuation lengths for @xmath20mev neutrons , compared with a total flux exiting the reactor that is no greater than @xmath21@xmath22s@xmath18 .",
    "this yields a vanishingly small reactor neutron flux in the gallery .",
    "similar arguments apply for reactor produced gamma rays .",
    "the tendon gallery is located about @xmath23  m below the surface , providing @xmath24  meters of water equivalent ( mwe ) overburden which eliminates the soft component of the cosmic ray flux and reduces the muonic component by a factor of @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "an important purpose of this prototype deployment was to determine whether cosmic ray induced backgrounds at this relatively shallow depth would overwhelm the reactor antineutrino signal in a simple detector .    the temperature in the tendon gallery is not actively controlled . due to the underground location",
    "diurnal temperature variations at the detector are small ( @xmath26c ) , although there is a slow seasonal variation of up to @xmath27c .",
    "small drifts in detector gain that result from this variation are accounted for via the detector calibration procedure ( sec .",
    "[ sec : calibration ] ) .    in the context of cooperative monitoring ,",
    "tendon galleries are ideal locations for antineutrino detectors .",
    "they are remote from daily reactor operations , provide significant overburden , and are as close as possible to the core while remaining outside of containment .",
    "antineutrinos are detected via the inverse beta decay process on quasi - free protons in hydrogenous scintillator : @xmath28 .",
    "the positron ( @xmath29 ) and neutron ( @xmath30 ) are detected in close time coincidence , allowing strong rejection of the much more frequent singles backgrounds due to natural radioactivity or neutron production .",
    "the positron deposits energy via bethe - bloch ionization as it slows in the scintillator , and upon annihilation with an electron , emits two gamma rays which can deposit up to an additional @xmath31  mev of energy . because the ionization and annihilation gamma ray energy depositions are effectively simultaneous , and promptly follow the antineutrino interaction , this combination of energy depositions is measured as a single event in the detector , referred to as the `` prompt '' energy deposition .",
    "assuming complete containment of the event , the prompt energy and the antineutrino energy are directly related through the equation :    @xmath32    in the current detector , this ideal relation is distorted by escape of @xmath33mev annihilation gamma rays that are created near the edge of the detector .",
    "monte carlo transport simulations account for this loss of energy , and allow for a full analysis of the deposited energy spectrum as well as providing an estimate of the efficiency for detection of the prompt energy ( sec .",
    "[ sec : positron ] ) .",
    "the neutron carries away a few kev of energy from the antineutrino interaction  @xcite and is detected by capture on a gadolinium ( gd ) dopant .",
    "the liquid scintillator is doped at @xmath34 by weight with natural gd , which is chosen for its very high neutron capture cross - section .",
    "the gd doping yields a neutron capture time of @xmath35s and an energy release of @xmath36mev via a gamma ray cascade , compared to a capture time of @xmath37s and energy release of @xmath38mev for capture on hydrogen .",
    "the interactions in the detector resulting from this @xmath39mev cascade are referred to as the `` delayed '' energy deposition . as with the positron ,",
    "the measured energy in the detector is somewhat less than @xmath39mev since some of the cascade gamma rays escape the detector volume without depositing their full energy .",
    "still , the increase in deposited energy and the decrease in the time interval combine to significantly improve the overall background rejection capability relative to capture in undoped scintillator .",
    "we can therefore expect to observe two classes of events in a detector based upon gd loaded liquid scintillator .",
    "the first , referred to here as correlated events , involve a prompt energy deposition associated with a neutron that is captured a short time later on a gd nucleus .",
    "the time separation between prompt and delayed energy depositions will follow an exponential distribution with time constant equal to the neutron capture time of the gd doped scintillator ( @xmath35s ) .",
    "the second class , referred to as uncorrelated backgrounds , involves the random `` coincidence '' of two independent energy depositions caused by natural backgrounds .",
    "we refer to these individual energy depositions as `` singles . ''",
    "since these backgrounds obey poisson statistics , the time separation between singles will also follow an exponential distribution with time constant equal to the inverse of the singles rate ( effectively the detector trigger rate ) .    unfortunately , antineutrino interactions are not the only events that produce correlated events in the detector . for example , fast neutrons , produced by muon capture or muon spallation @xcite , can scatter off protons in the scintillator , giving a prompt energy deposition , and then be captured on gd with the characteristic time distribution . therefore ,",
    "observation of correlated events alone is not sufficient to measure the reactor antineutrino flux ",
    "the correlated background rate must also be determined . accurate _ a priori _ calculations of the background are difficult since they depend strongly upon the geometry and composition of the detector surroundings . in practice",
    ", one must wait for a reactor off period to measure the correlated background rate .",
    "the songs1 detector consists of three subsystems ; a central detector containing the gd - doped liquid scintillator target and photomultiplier tubes , a passive water or polyethylene shield on all sides , and a plastic scintillator muon veto system placed outside the water shield on five sides of the detector .    in addition to the detector itself",
    "the installation at songs includes the data acquisition system  ( daq , sec .",
    "[ sec : daq ] ) and a computer that automatically performs the data analysis described in sec .",
    "[ sec : analysis ] .",
    "a modem is used to automatically retrieve the results of this analysis as well as detector state of health indicators , allowing for the remote monitoring of the detector , and indeed of reactor operation .",
    "the songs1 system typically operates without physical intervention for months at a time .      the central detector , seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : detector ] , consists of four identical stainless steel cells , each with inner dimensions of @xmath40 cm by @xmath40 cm by @xmath41 cm , filled with @xmath42tons of liquid scintillator .",
    "stainless steel was used rather than the more typical acrylic to avoid any possibility of attack by the scintillator on the container walls , and subsequent leakage of the flammable scintillator . to improve reflectivity ,",
    "the sides and bottom of each cell are lined with foil wrapped acrylic sheets . to increase the fraction of totally internally reflected ( tir ) light , these sheets were sealed within transparent fluorinatedethylenepropylene ( fep ) bags filled with argon  @xcite .",
    "the bags make it difficult to measure the detector volume to high precision , resulting in a @xmath43 uncertainty in this quantity . however , this is of no consequence for our relative measurement of the reactor antineutrino flux .",
    "we use scintillator remaining after the completion of the palo verde antineutrino detection experiment  @xcite .",
    "this scintillator has a density of @xmath44 g  @xmath45 and is @xmath46 hydrogen by weight . the development and characteristics of this scintillator are described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "scintillation light generated by the interaction of particles in the cells propagates to @xmath47inch hemispherical photonis  xp1802 photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) by means of an acrylic coupling cylinder submerged in the liquid and extending through an opaque acrylic lid .",
    "there are two pmts mounted on each cell ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : detector ] ) .",
    "both gamma ray and neutron fluxes in the central detector are reduced by passive water or polyethylene shielding which surrounds the detector on six sides .",
    "the water is contained in acrylic tanks , supported by perforated angle stainless steel racks .",
    "on average the passive layer is @xmath48  m thick .",
    "an mcnp simulation predicts that a shield of this thickness reduces the flux of @xmath20mev neutrons and @xmath49mev gamma rays by factors of @xmath50 and @xmath23 respectively .",
    "a @xmath49 cm thick plastic scintillator envelope identifies and rejects cosmic ray muons . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : detector ] , the envelope is comprised of scintillator paddles of different sizes placed on five sides of the detector , read out by photomultiplier tubes .",
    "the paddles are wrapped first with aluminum foil to enhance reflectivity and then with black tape for light tightness .    for the top ,",
    "horizontally oriented paddles , the well separated muon peak was identified in the paddle energy distribution , at its expected location of @xmath51mev . the energy threshold defining a muon",
    "was set three sigma below this peak , with the sigma defined by a fit to the rising lobe of the landau - distributed muon spectrum .",
    "this procedure introduces a small amount of contamination from the tail of the paddle gamma ray distribution , which extends above @xmath52mev , but the total deadtime introduced by the muon veto even with this contamination remains small .",
    "due to the geometry of muon interactions , the muon spectrum in the vertically oriented paddles has no clear peak .",
    "thresholds in vertically oriented paddles were set relative to the rates in the horizontal paddles , by assuming a @xmath53 distribution for the muon flux , which predicts that the flux through a vertically oriented paddle should be @xmath54 that of a horizontally oriented paddle . the total rate at which muons are recorded by this system is @xmath55  hz .",
    "the number of detected antineutrino interactions in the detector is directly related to the individual isotopic fission rates through the equation    @xmath56    in this equation , @xmath57 is the number of detected antineutrino interactions in a time interval t. @xmath58 is the number of target protons in the detector , @xmath59 is the distance from the detector to the center of the reactor core , @xmath60 is the number of fissions per second from the @xmath61th isotope . in practice",
    "the index runs over the four dominant fissioning isotopes @xmath62u , @xmath63u , @xmath64pu and @xmath65pu , which account for @xmath66 of fissions in a typical reactor .",
    "@xmath67 and @xmath68 , both depending on the antineutrino energy @xmath69 , are respectively the cross - section for the inverse beta interaction , and the number density per mev and fission for the @xmath61th isotope .",
    "@xmath70 is the energy dependent intrinsic detection efficiency .",
    "the integral extends over all antineutrino energies above the @xmath71mev threshold of the inverse beta interaction .    with our current @xmath72ton liquid scintillator detector at a standoff of @xmath73",
    "m from the reactor core , and with the reactor parameters defined in sec .",
    "[ sec : site ] , the rate predicted by eq .",
    "[ eq : nurate ] at the beginning of the reactor fuel cycle is approximately @xmath74 antineutrino interactions per day for a perfectly efficient detector .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] shows the architecture of the data acquisition and trigger . as mentioned earlier , there are two pmts per scintillator cell .",
    "custom preamplifiers built into the bases of the pmts produce tail pulses that are sent to a caen  n568 spectroscopy amplifier for shaping .",
    "the approximately gaussian shaped output of the n568 is passed directly to two caen  v785 peak sensing analog - to - digital - converters ( adcs ) .",
    "a fast amplified signal from the n568  amplifier is passed to a caen  v812 constant fraction discriminator ( cfd ) module .",
    "hardware thresholds are set at @xmath75  mev for each pmt , so as to allow online calibration using the @xmath76mev @xmath77tl gamma ray from the thorium chain  ( sec  [ sec : calibration ] ) .",
    "the anode outputs of all muon paddles are passed directly to caen v812 cfds , and the or output from these is used for vetoing and timing purposes .",
    "gates for the adcs are produced by the following trigger logic .",
    "a coincidence is formed from the two discriminator outputs corresponding to the pmts on the same cell using an ortec  c4020 logic module ( a cell trigger ",
    "typically @xmath78hz per cell ) .",
    "the logical or of the four cell triggers is taken ( typically @xmath79hz ) , and combined with the logical not of a @xmath80s long muon veto signal . a non - retriggerable logic pulse of @xmath81s duration ( an acquisition trigger",
    " typical rate @xmath82hz ) is produced at this stage since this is the approximate duration of the shaped output of the n568 ; accepting events with shorter separation would only result in pulse pileup at the adcs .",
    "thus , an event that causes two pmts from any single cell to fire in coincidence , at least @xmath80s after the passage of the last muon and @xmath81s after the last cell trigger , will result in one of the adcs being gated .",
    "gates are generated for each adc in turn , so that while one adc is digitizing ( v785 digitization time @xmath83s ) the other can accept another event .",
    "gates are generated until the @xmath84  event buffer on each adc is full .",
    "once these buffers have been emptied , the flip flop generating the alternating gates is reset so that it is known which adc receives the first trigger , allowing subsequent events to be formed into correctly ordered pairs in later analysis  ( sec .  [",
    "sec : analysis ] ) .    in similar fashion , pairs of time - to - amplitude - converters ( tacs ) are used to record timing information .",
    "the ortec  566 tacs utilized have a long @xmath85s reset time , which if used singly would result in an unacceptably large fraction of events being recorded without timing information .",
    "thus , start and stop signals are alternated between a pair of tacs ; the stop for one is the start for the other . to record the time between pairs of events ( the interevent time ) the acquisition trigger serves as both the start and the stop signal . to be certain that the combination of adc and tac deadtimes does not introduce a non - uniform response",
    ", we only consider interevent times greater than @xmath86s in the analysis that follows .",
    "to record the time to last muon , the acquisition trigger serves as the stop signal , while the start signal is either the previous acquisition trigger or a muon signal if that occurred sooner .",
    "this start logic is necessary since the tacs are single shot ",
    "the production of a tac output pulse clears the timer . always recording the time to last event",
    ", either muon or cell , solves this problem , but introduces about @xmath87% extra deadtime .",
    "both tac signals are digitized simultaneously with the pmt pulses by the peak sensing adcs .",
    "a high fidelity detector simulation is not necessary for the relative antineutrino rate measurements of interest here .",
    "indeed , this lack of reliance on simulation is a strength in the context of the practical application of antineutrino detection technology to safeguards .",
    "instead , we used monte carlo simulations to gain insight into the atypical particle transport properties of the songs1 detector , and to estimate the efficiency of our detector .",
    "we used the mcnpx  @xcite package , which simulates particle transport , but does not model the transport of the optical photons generated in the scintillation process . to account for the optical photon response",
    ", we used a simple model that incorporates photostatistics and the measured vertical position variation in each cell . because the variation in light collection has an important effect on the response function , a fuller understanding of the detector response ultimately requires a simulation or measurement of the transport properties of visible scintillation photons throughout the entire detector volume .",
    "however , even without these inputs , we can still estimate the energy scale and the positron and neutron detection efficiencies , and confirm the expected transport behavior of positrons , neutrons and gamma rays in the detector and surrounding materials .      we simulated particle transport in the scintillator , the surrounding materials including the acrylic optical couplings , the pmts , the reflective panels inside the detector , the stainless steel detector walls and support structure , the water shield and the plastic muon veto .",
    "characteristic gamma rays for the background simulation ( sec .",
    "[ sec : gamma_bkg ] ) were propagated from a maximum depth of @xmath88 m in the surrounding concrete  beyond this depth there was a negligible chance for interaction in the detector .",
    "partial characterization of the optical response of the detector was derived from a vertical scan in one cell with a light emitting diode ( led ) .",
    "the led position was offset approximately 8 centimeters transversely from the center of the cell .",
    "pulse height spectra were recorded at seven positions from @xmath23  to  @xmath89  cm from the top of the scintillator cell .",
    "the variation in response , averaged over the two pmts , is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ledfig ] .",
    "as seen in the figure , the response is fairly uniform until the source is within about @xmath90 cm of the top of the cell .",
    "we use this data set to parameterize the effects of both photostatistics and vertical position on the detector energy resolution .",
    "the parametrization is then used to estimate the effect of optics on the energy resolution in the gamma ray , neutron , and positron transport simulations described below .",
    "we model the optical resolution function @xmath91 as :    @xmath92    here @xmath93 represents the average effect of the vertical position on the pmt response , and @xmath94 is the variation in response caused by the finite number of photoelectrons generated in the event .",

    "[ fig : ledfig ] .",
    "@xmath97 , accounting for photostatistics , has a value of @xmath98 , which is the typical fractional width of the led pulse hight spectra in the position scan .",
    "although horizontal variation of light collection has an important impact on the resolution , a horizontal scan at different heights was impractical and was not included in the model . while this ultimately limits the fidelity of the simulation , this simple model is sufficient to estimate the energy scale and detection efficiencies , and confirms our main expectations about the detector response to antineutrino events .      as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : calibration ] the detector energy calibration is derived from a fit to a spectral feature due to the @xmath76mev @xmath77tl gamma ray from the thorium chain and to measured adc pedestal values .",

    "it is interesting to note that even with the@xmath119@xmath120 efficiency through the positron and neutron cuts , the underlying event rate is still high enough to give several hundred antineutrino events per day in our detector . when combined with the expected antineutrino interaction rate in our detector ( sec .",
    "[ sec : expected_rate ] ) this efficiency allows us to estimate the number of antineutrino events that we should observe : @xmath121  /day .",

    "[ cols=\"<,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     to further confirm that we are observing reactor antineutrinos , we can also examine the prompt event energy spectrum during reactor on and off periods ( fig .",
    "[ fig : prompt_energy]a ) . with the unit  2 reactor",
    "off , we are measuring the prompt energy spectrum of the correlated backgrounds , while with the reactor on we measure the sum of these backgrounds and the prompt antineutrino interaction energy deposition .",
    "( b ) the inferred inverse beta positron energy spectrum derived by subtracting the reactor off data from the reactor on data . the solid line shows the monte carlo prediction , including transport effects and the simple optical model.,width=288 ]    as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : nubarint ] the prompt energy deposition in an inverse beta interaction is essentially that of the incoming antineutrino . the expected prompt energy spectrum was given in sec .",
    "[ sec : positron ] ; we expect the distribution to go to zero at around @xmath23  mev .",
    "this is what we observe in fig .",
    "[ fig : prompt_energy]a  above this energy the reactor on and reactor off distributions agree .",
    "furthermore , we can determine the prompt energy spectrum of the reactor correlated events ( fig .",
    "[ fig : prompt_energy]b ) , and compare it to that expected from the monte carlo calculation ( sec .",
    "[ sec : positron ] ) .",
    "the agreement is good , again confirming that we are indeed detecting reactor antineutrinos .    in principle",
    ", the highest energy neutrons in the reactor spectrum could create a correlated antineutrino - like signal in the detector in that same way that fast neutrons produced by cosmic rays do .",
    "however , as noted in sec .",
    "[ sec : site ] , this rate is negligible , since reactor fast and thermal neutrons from the core are completely attenuated by the @xmath122 m of concrete between the core and the detector . the reactor associated gamma flux at the detector location is similarly negligible .",
    "our deployment of an antineutrino detector at a nuclear reactor has shown that even a cubic meter scale detector of modest efficiency can easily measure hundreds of antineutrino events per day , a large enough count rate to be of interest for cooperative monitoring regimes .",
    "of particular interest is the relative smallness of the detector compared to many other modern reactor antineutrino detectors .",
    "( these earlier detectors have typically used larger active volumes to improve containment of the spatially diffuse neutron - induced gamma shower , while we have sacrificed some efficiency to reduce our overall footprint . )",
    "we have also shown that the detector can operate for months to years with only very occasional maintenance needed by the safeguards inspector .",
    "this is an important point since inspector - days dominate the cost of reactor safeguards regimes .",
    "calibrations can be performed using omnipresent gamma ray backgrounds , without the need for external check sources .",
    "concerning stability of response , we have been able to use scintillator mixed several years prior to our experiment , for two years running , with no observable reduction in response due to aging .",
    "this perhaps surprising result again relates to the smallness of our detector , where the typical travel paths for scintillation photons are only of the order @xmath5-@xmath123  meters compared to several meters or tens of meters in other experiments .",
    "our impact on day - to - day operations at the reactor site has been negligible , an important consideration for gaining acceptance by reactor operators .",
    "as far as the deployment site itself is concerned , as noted above in sec .",
    "[ sec : site ] , we are gratified to have found that many reactors around the world appear to possess annular galleries with overburden and standoff characteristics similar to the ones enjoyed in our own installation .    in summary ,",
    "our initial experience with deployment augurs well for the near - term utility of this novel reactor safeguards tool .",
