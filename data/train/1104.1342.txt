    "graphene - based devices are exciting candidates for future generations of microelectronic devices .",
    "a promising technique to produce graphene at an industrial scale is the epitaxial graphene growth from a sic substrate , because these sic substrates can be patterned using standard lithography methods .",
    "thanks to recent technical improvements , the most delicate and intrinsic features of graphene , those reflecting the chiral nature of the quasiparticles , as , for instance , the so - called half integer quantum hall effect  @xcite and the weak antilocalization  @xcite , have been recently reported for epitaxial graphene .    in graphene , depending on the relative magnitude of intervalley scattering time and phase coherence time , either weak localization ( wl ) or weak antilocalization ( wal ) has been predicted  @xcite .",
    "the phase interference correction to the resistance depends on the nature of the disorder . for epitaxial graphene samples ,",
    "elastic scattering favorable for wal can be caused by remote charges like ionized impurities in the substrate .",
    "on the other hand , atomically sharp disorder ( local defects , edges ) causes intervalley scattering and gives rise to wl .",
    "experimentally , in two - dimensional gases , wl is often mixed with electron - electron interaction  @xcite ( eei ) .",
    "as wl , eei gives a correction to the drude conductivity with a @xmath1 dependence .",
    "it follows that the experimental extraction and separation of eei and wal contributions are usually difficult  @xcite . for graphene , in the diffusive regime",
    ", eei is expected to give this usual temperature dependence correction proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "eei is also expected to be sensitive to the different kinds of disorders  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we take advantage of simultaneous measurements of the longitudinal and transverse resistances to invert the resistivity tensor .",
    "we can then separate the different mechanisms which give corrections to the drude conductivity : i ) a geometric contribution , which experimentally appears as a constant term in the longitudinal conductivity ; ii ) wl and wal , by a comparison between the experimental magnetoconductance and the drude magnetoconductivity , iii ) eei , whose temperature dependence can be analyzed in the magnetic field range for which wal has disappeared .",
    "we have used large and homogeneous single epitaxial graphene layers grown on the c - face of an insulating 8@xmath0 off - axis 4h - sic substrate .",
    "the graphene sheets have an elongated triangular shape of which quality and homogeneity can be easily checked using micro - raman spectroscopy . on few selected samples , cr /",
    "au ohmic contacts were deposited to define hall - bars with a rough geometry ( see inset in fig.1 for details ) . then magneto - transport measurements were done using a 14 t magnet in a cryostat and a variable temperature inset operated down to 1.5k . on the best samples , at high magnetic field ,",
    "the half - integer quantum hall effect could be observed up to the last plateau in the temperature range 1.5 to 40k . for details , see ref .",

    "an overview of the results obtained for sample s1 is shown in fig.1 . the experimental longitudinal and transverse magnetoresistances @xmath17 and @xmath18 for sample @xmath3 are presented in fig .",
    "1a and 1b respectively , at different temperatures between 1.6k and 48k .",
    "let us consider first , fig .",
    "1a . at low fields ( @xmath19 0.1 t ) , a negative magnetoresistance peak centered at @xmath20 t",
    "is observed in @xmath21 .",
    "this peak is typical of weak localization ( wl ) .",
    "indeed , this peak a linear dependence of @xmath21 _ vs _ @xmath2 with a slope of the order of @xmath22 ( see inset of fig .",
    "1a ) and the amplitude of the peak is @xmath23 ( @xmath24 is the longitudinal resistivity ) . at higher magnetic fields , reproducible fluctuations in the conductance @xmath25",
    "are also observed , with amplitudes @xmath26 for @xmath3 and @xmath27 for @xmath4 .    at magnetic fields @xmath28 t , a smooth depression is observed in @xmath21 , which we attribute to weak antilocalization ( wal ) .",
    "because this wal is barely visible in fig .",
    "1a , we also present additional experimental results in appendix a. experimentally , wal is blurred because fluctuations of conductance are also present , and also because the positive magnetoresistance of the wal is superposed to another positive magnetoresistance with a pronounced parabolic dependence , which is well observed on the whole magnetic field range @xmath29 t presented in fig .",
    "the theory of weak localization is based on the diffusion approximation and does not hold for magnetic fields much higher than @xmath30= @xmath31 100 mt , where @xmath15 is the transport relaxation time and @xmath32 the diffusion coefficient .",
    "this means that the parabolic background above @xmath30 should not be attributed to wl features .",
    "it must have a different origin .",
    "since the device is being far from having the shape of an ideal hall - bar ( see inset in fig.1b ) we ascribe this parabolic magnetoresistance component to magnetic deflection of the current lines .",
    "this is because the lateral probes are invasive and because the graphene layer under the lateral contacts is likely to have different mobility and carrier concentration  @xcite . for details , see annex b.    beyond geometric and interference corrections , a third correction to the resistivity manifests .",
    "it comes from electron - electron interactions and shows as : i ) the persistence of a @xmath2 linear temperature dependence of @xmath21 , in a magnetic field range where interference effects are suppressed ( see inset of fig .",
    "1a for a field of @xmath33 ) ; ii ) a variation of the hall slope ( fig .",
    "1b ) as a function of @xmath34 , which can not be explained by variations of the carrier density , as the hole gas is strongly degenerate ( @xmath35 20 for @xmath36k , where @xmath37 is the fermi energy ) ; iii ) a crossing of all @xmath17 resistances taken at different temperatures at @xmath38 ( fig .",
    "1a )  @xcite .",
    "the justification of the last two points , originally given in  @xcite , is as follows .",
    "eei give no correction to the transverse conductance @xmath39 .",
    "it gives a small correction @xmath40 to the longitudinal conductance @xmath41 .",
    "this correction does not depend on @xmath42 if the magnetic field is smaller than a critical field @xmath43 .",
    "this condition if fulfilled for all the temperature and magnetic field ranges of this study . because of this correction , eei gives rise to a negative magnetoresistance in the first order in @xmath44 : @xmath45 and a variation of the hall slope @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the conductivity at @xmath20 .",
    "these relations are derived by inverting the conductivity tensor : @xmath48    it has been established recently  @xcite that the separation of eei and wl  @xcite is simplified if the magnetoconductivities @xmath49 and @xmath50 are used , rather than the resistivities . as already stressed ,",
    "the conductivity of the graphene layer is different below the cr / au contacts and , strictly speaking , inverting the resistivity tensor is incorrect because the device is inhomogeneous .",
    "however , experimentally , the geometric correction is small , appears only in the longitudinal magnetoresistance as a parabolic correction , and consequently geometric corrections to the longitudinal conductivity appear as a @xmath42-independent shift @xmath51 .",
    "the magnetoconductivities for sample @xmath3 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sxxsxy ] at different temperatures .",
    "the conductivities have been obtained from eq .",
    "[ eqn : sxx ] and  [ eqn : sxy ] , where the resistivities have been estimated by @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the lower inset of fig.2 shows that all @xmath49 taken at different temperatures collapse on the same curve , as expected for eei .",
    "this also confirms that both mobility and carrier concentration are constant over the whole temperature range and , as the geometric correction only depends on @xmath34 via the hall angle @xmath54 , that @xmath51 does not depend on the temperature .",
    "finally , the @xmath34-independence of the transverse conductivity indicates an effective separation of eei ( @xmath40 ) and interference ( @xmath55 ) corrections over almost the whole @xmath42-range . at low fields @xmath56 , a @xmath34-dependence of @xmath39 due to wl",
    "is expected but is not observed , being beyond our experimental resolution .    the large decrease of @xmath50 between 0 and 2 t in fig .",
    "[ fig : sxxsxy ] is due to the magnetic field dependence of the drude conductivity @xmath57 .",
    "we express the total conductivity by @xmath58 when wl is negligible : @xmath59 , we impose @xmath60 and eq",
    ".  [ eqsigma ] , for a given temperature , simplifies as @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is a constant which incorporates both geometric and eei corrections .",
    "this last formula gives very good fits to the conductivity at all temperatures .",
    "as an example , the blue dotted line in fig .",
    "2 is the fit for the @xmath34=5.6k data in the interval 0.5 - 2 t , where @xmath47 , @xmath5 and @xmath62 are the fit parameters .",
    "transverse and longitudinal resistivities can be fitted separately but still give very similar mobilities and concentrations , which are reported in table  i.    the upper inset in fig .",
    "2 is an enlargement of the low-@xmath42 data at @xmath63 and evidences the weak antilocalization peak which takes place around the weak localization centered at @xmath20 .",
    "a similar weak antilocalization can be detected for all temperatures .",
    "the wl theory does not take into account the modification of the current paths due to magnetic field .",
    "in other words , before examining the wl contribution to the conductivity , we should first subtract the drude fits @xmath64 ( given by the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : sxxsxy ] ) to the observed longitudinal conductivities  @xcite . experimental results for samples @xmath4 and @xmath3 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wl ] , for different temperatures .",
    "in the diffusive regime in graphene , @xmath55 is given by  @xcite : @xmath65,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 , @xmath67 is the digamma function , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the coherence time , the intervalley scattering time and the intravalley scattering time respectively . for simplicity , we identify intervalley to short range ( sr ) scattering and intravalley to long - range ( lr ) scattering .",
    "we take constant scattering times @xmath13 and @xmath14 over the whole temperature range and only @xmath70 is allowed to depend on @xmath34 . neglecting the warping  @xcite , we also impose @xmath71 .",
    "we then fit the conductivities at different temperatures by eq .",
    "[ eqn : wl ] .",
    "results are indicated by dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : wl ] ( for sake of clarity , fits at high temperatures have not been reported ) .",
    "best fit is obtained with the values reported in table i. we estimate the short - range scattering length @xmath72 @xmath73 100 - 140 nm .",
    "the long - range scattering length @xmath74 @xmath73 70 - 90 nm is even shorter .",
    "these lengths are comparable to what is found in exfoliated graphene on sio@xmath75 substrate  @xcite .",
    "they are also comparable to the distance between the sic steps below the graphene layer .",
    "it is often stated that exfoliated graphene is much more disordered at the edge of the sic steps  @xcite .",
    "therefore step edges could be the main source of scatterings in these samples .",
    "the phase coherence time @xmath70 obtained from the fit is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : tauphi ] . apart from a saturation at low @xmath34",
    ", @xmath76 is roughly proportional to @xmath77 between 10k-50k with a slope equal to @xmath73 50 ps k for samples @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath76 obeys the usual temperature dependence for electron electron scattering in the diffusive regime : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the reduced conductivity : @xmath80 and the empirical coefficient @xmath81 is 1 for @xmath3 and 1.4 for @xmath4 .",
    "similar observations have already been done both for epitaxial  @xcite and exfoliated graphene  @xcite . the coherence length @xmath82 is readily calculated and plotted in fig .",
    "at low temperature , @xmath83 slightly exceeds 1@xmath5 m .",
    "we attribute the temperature dependence of the conductivity to eei .",
    "the drude mobility is constant over the whole temperature range , therefore there is no temperature dependence of the conductivity induced by electron - phonon scattering .",
    "this is not surprising , as the temperature dependence for graphene is small below the grneisen temperature @xmath84 given by @xmath85 54@xmath86 k , where the concentration @xmath87 is in unit of 10@xmath9@xmath10  @xcite . for our samples , @xmath85 54 k , and",
    "almost all our measurements are done below the grneisen temperature .",
    "as @xmath88 , we are by definition in the diffusive regime , for which eei theory predicts a temperature dependent correction to the conductivity given by : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is a prefactor whose value depends on the different channels contributing to the eei  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : kee ] , we show @xmath91 for samples @xmath4 and @xmath3 . the expected @xmath92 dependence is evidenced and the slope gives @xmath90= 0.81@xmath93 and 0.74 @xmath94 for samples @xmath4 and @xmath3 respectively .",
    "these values are very similar to recent experimental findings on exfoliated graphene  @xcite . in a 2d system with a single valley",
    ", @xmath90 takes the form  @xcite @xmath95 where the unity represents the so - called charge contribution ( the fock and singlet part of hartree term ) , the @xmath96 prefactor is the number of triplet channels ( from the hartree term ) and @xmath97 is the liquid fermi constant . at low temperatures @xmath98 ( @xmath99 15 k for @xmath4 and @xmath100 for @xmath3 ) ,",
    "when long range and short range scattering rates are important , the usual single - valley case is recovered with a prefactor @xmath101 .",
    "this leads to @xmath97 = -0.13 @xmath102 .",
    "this value is small and very close to the value of @xmath97 recently found for exfoliated graphene  @xcite .",
    "this is somehow surprising , as the dielectric constant in sic ( 10 ) is larger than in sio@xmath75 ( 3.9 ) and we would expect even smaller electron - electron interactions because of the screening of the substrate .",
    "however , numerical estimation of @xmath97 following , for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite gives @xmath103 : a value compatible with our experiment . also , ref .",
    "@xcite predicts values for the fermi liquid constant only slightly smaller than our findings .",
    "interestingly , it was also recently quoted  @xcite that at intermediate temperatures @xmath104 , additional triplet channels originating from pseudospin conservation ( ie valley degeneracy ) become relevant and the number of triplet channels increases to @xmath105 .",
    "however , we do not observe any change in the slope in fig . 5 from @xmath34=1.5k up to 50k .",
    "the situation is similar in ref .",
    "@xcite , where eei is observed on a temperature range on which the slope should vary , but where experimentally the slope remains constant .    to conclude , we show , beyond classical geometric corrections , weak localization , weak antilocalization and electron - electron interactions in epitaxial graphene .",
    "weak antilocalization is observable directly in the resistances , and its analysis gives access to the different scattering times , which are very close to those for exfoliated graphene on sio@xmath75 substrates .",
    "electron - electron interaction gives also a small correction to the conductivity , which is not significantly smaller than in exfoliated graphene .",
