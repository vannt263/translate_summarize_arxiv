    "active region ( ar ) noaa 12192 contained the largest sunspot group to date of solar cycle 24 .",
    "the interior of this ar produced a multitude of big x - and m - class flares as well as many b- and c - class flares during its passage across the solar disk from 2014 october 17 to 30 .",
    "all of these interior flares were confined , i.e. they did not produce cmes @xcite .",
    "the ar apparently produced a large fast cme on october 14 , before it rotated onto the disk @xcite . during disk passage , it produced six ` streamer - puff cmes ' @xcite , where the cme comes from a compact ejective eruption in a foot of one loop of a coronal - streamer base magnetic arcade and the streamer transiently bulges out but is not blown away completely by the passage of the cme @xcite .",
    "only one of these cmes , accompanied by an m4.0 flare , was previously reported @xcite .",
    "they all originated from the southeast edge of the ar , from a series of coronal jets occurring at a neutral - line - containing subregion at that location , a neutral line separate from that of the ar - interior confined flares .",
    " jets \" are dynamic , transient , collimated features that become long compared to their width .",

    "figures [ cme](d - f ) and [ cme](g - i ) respectively show the cmes from jets j4 and j5 .",

    "the slope of the green dashed arrow in figure [ vl](d ) gives 310 km  s@xmath1  for the upflow speed of jet j2 .",
    "figure [ vl](d ) shows another enhanced brightening beginning at 17:32 ut , which is due to a subsequent jet that was not centered on the white line of figure [ vl](c ) . this was a non - cme - producing jet ( j12 ;",
    "table [ tab : list](b ) ) .",
    "one can see in movie304 that plasma from this jet does not reach as high as the earlier jet ( j2 ) .",
    "the material of jet j12 mainly becomes trapped in closed field lines .",

    "figure [ vl](f ) shows the height - time plot along the white fiducial line of figure [ vl](e ) .",
    "this jet is much broader than other jets shown in table [ tab : list](a ) , and had a plane - of - sky speed of about 400 km  s@xmath1  along the white line ( slope of the green dashed arrow ) .",
    "this jet produced a cme with plane - of - the - sky speed of 680 km  s@xmath1 , which is twice that of the cme from jet j2 .",
    "speeds of all five jets and cmes are listed in table [ tab : list](a ) .",
    "the cme speeds are taken from the lasco cme catalog .",
    "we extrapolated a linear fit of the plane - of - the - sky speeds back in time , and found the start times to match well with the jet start times for all six cases .",
    "this further supports that the cmes originated from the jets .        to see the difference between the cme - producing jets and non - cme - producing jets",
    ", we measured the speeds , durations and widths of both categories of jets ( table [ tab : list](a , b ) ) . unlike the cme - producing jets",
    ", the non - cme jets do not show a clear / visible and traceable ejection of transition - region plasma leaving the aia fov . for calculating their outflow speeds",
    ", we tracked the leading edge of the jet in the 304   images during the jets rise .",
    "( using this method to measure speeds of the six cme - producing jets does not result in values substantially different from those listed in table [ tab : list](a ) , which we found using the time - distance plots such as in figures [ vl](d ) and [ vl](f ) .",
    "thus our two speed - measurement methods are mutually - consistent . )",
    "the non - cme jets that erupted in conjunction with substantial flares ( j10 , j12 , j13 and j14 ) had higher speeds than the non - cme jets ( j8 , j9 and j11 ) .    figure [ vl](a ) shows the underlying magnetic field of the ar and jet region . the jet base is a complex mix of emerging and canceling flux ( figure [ vl](b ) ) throughout the disk passage of ar 12192 .",
    "therefore we can only conclude that the jets occurred from a location where both flux emergence and cancellation were occurring .",
    "the properties of our jets are typical of those of _ yohkoh_/sxt - observed jets from ars @xcite .",
    "our cme - producing jets have different properties than our non - cme - producing jets .",
    "we find the following : ( a ) relatively more of the cool transition - region plasma escaped from the sun in the case of cme - producing jets whereas relatively more fell back to the surface in the non - cme - producing jets ; ( b ) the cme - producing jets are faster ( 300 @xmath3 75 km  s@xmath1 ) than the non - cme - producing jets ( 105 @xmath3 40 km  s@xmath1 ) ; ( c ) they tend to be longer in duration ( mean duration and weighted standard deviation are 35 and 10 minutes , respectively ) than the non - cme - producing jets ( 18 and 9 minutes , respectively ) ; and d ) they are wider ( mean width and weighted standard deviation are 43,000 and 24,000 km , respectively ) than the non - cme - producing jets ( 15,000 and 27,00 km , respectively ) .",
    "our jet - driven cmes are slower ( speed @xmath0300 km  s@xmath1 ) than average cmes with flares ( @xmath9 750 km  s@xmath1 , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .     would correspond to the low - lying magenta loops of ( b ) and ( c ) . )",
    "the red lines in ( b ) and ( c ) represent the twist transferred from the erupting field to the high - reaching jet - guiding coronal loop of the streamer - base helmet arcade by the external reconnection .",
    "the ` + ' and `  ' labels are for positive and negative magnetic polarity , respectively . ]",
    "our cmes result from jet eruptions .",
    "recently , it has been found that jets in coronal holes are driven by minifilament eruptions @xcite .",
    "the minifilaments reside in presumably - twisted magnetic field in the core of a small bipole between ambient open field and the minority - polarity side of a larger bipole .",
    "the minifilament - carrying bipole erupts and reconnects with the open field , producing the jet .",
    "it is plausible that our ar jets here operate the same way as @xcite coronal hole jets ( cf .",
    "we further speculate that our jets lead to the cmes as follows . during the reconnection , twist of the erupting - minifilament field",
    "is transferred to the newly - reconnected open field @xcite .",
    "since our ar jet eruptions occur in the foot of one loop of the streamer - base arcade , only that loop gets blown out rather than the whole arcade and whole streamer , and thus results in a streamer - puff cme @xcite .",
    "figure [ dia ] shows a schematic of this proposed process based on our observations .",
    "the jet - producing region ( dashed box in figure [ dia](a ) ) is embedded in the outskirt of the overall arcade of loops of the ar and inside the arcade base of a lasco - observed large streamer .",
    "based on @xcite and because there is cool transition - region plasma in our jets , we assume that the jet - producing region ( figures [ dia](a ) and [ dia](a1 ) ) includes a sheared field that contains a minifilament ( @xcite confirm that at least one of the jets of this region originates as an erupting ( mini)filament ) . and",
    "since we observe spinning motion in our jets , we further assume that the minifilament resides in twisted field ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "following the schematic of @xcite , we envision that at the start of the jet the minifilament - holding field erupts , and undergoes two forms of magnetic reconnection : ( i ) _ internal reconnection _ among the legs of field inside of ( i.e. _ internal _ to ) the erupting minifilament field ( lowest star in figure [ dia](a1 ) ) that makes bright flare ribbons and loops at the jet base ( shown as the jet - base left - hand - side small magenta loop in figures [ dia](b ) and [ dia](c ) ) , and ( ii ) _ external reconnection _",
    "( highest star in figure [ dia](a1 ) ) of the erupting minifilament field with a loop of the big arcade that is _ external _ to the minifilament field .",
    "this external reconnection : ( 1 ) makes the jet - base right - hand - side small magenta loop in figures [ dia](b ) and [ dia](c ) , and ( 2 ) transfers twist from the erupting field to the reconnecting big loop ( red twisted lines in figure [ dia](b ) ) .",
    "we observed remote brightenings and dimmings at the far end of the erupting - cme loop ( figure [ jet](d ) , ( h ) , and ( l ) and table [ tab : list ] ) , consistent with this picture ; the brightenings are from high - speed electrons that are accelerated by the external reconnection , escape along the big loop , and impact the far - end lower atmosphere ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the dimmings are due to the big - loop blowout ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "during the eruptions , only one segment of the outer streamer arcade gets ejected rather than the whole coronal streamer arcade because the jet eruptions occur in the foot of only one loop of the arcade .",
    "the added magnetic pressure from the added twist drives the arcade loop out to become the streamer - puff cme ; that is , the twist - loaded magnetic loop of the streamer base ( figure [ dia](c ) ) erupts to become the streamer - puff cme .",
    "after each eruption , the opened field presumably recloses by reconnection , which allows the series of cmes from the homologous jets @xcite .",
    "this picture of streamer - puff cmes differs from that of @xcite .",
    "they proposed a scenario whereby a flux - rope plasmoid explodes up the leg of the loop of the streamer - base arcade from a compact ejective flare eruption , and explodes the loop top outward to become the streamer - puff cme @xcite .",
    "we propose that the cmes are driven by the helicity loaded onto the magnetic - arch loop from the erupting minifilament field as the jet forms , rather than by an erupting plasmoid as suggested by @xcite .",
    "high - quality aia data were not available for the events of @xcite .",
    "we have since learned that many jets result from minfilament eruptions @xcite , and so we suspect the jets we observe here occur that way also .",
    "moreover , aia images of our events here show no indication of an erupting plasmoid ( which would appear as a largely - intact closed - loop flux - rope structure ; see figures .",
    "3(b ) and 3(c ) of @xcite ) .",
    "rather , apparently the minifilament field is entirely opened by the external reconnection and ceases to be a plasmoid early in the jet - formation process ( figures [ dia](a ) , [ dia](a1 ) and [ dia](b ) ) , having become new big - arch field in the jet and new closed loops in the jet s base ( figure [ jet](b , f , and j ) ) . therefore , at least for the events presented here , the figure [ dia ] schematic explains the streamer - puff phenomenon better than does the schematic of @xcite .",
