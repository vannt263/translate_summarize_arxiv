    "the lightcurves from dipping low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) such as  show dips recurring at the orbital period of the system ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] bottom ) .",
    "dips are due to a structure passing through the line - of - sight at each orbital rotation .",
    "this structure is probably a thickened region of the disk related to the impact of the stream from the companion star into the disk .",
    "the presence of periodic dips and absence of eclipses from the companion indicate that dipping sources are viewed relatively close to edge - on .",
    "the x - ray spectra of most of the dip sources become harder during dipping ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] top ) . however , simple photo - electric absorption by cool ( neutral ) material fails to explain the spectral changes from persistent to dipping intervals .",
    "therefore , more complex models have been proposed . in particular , the `` complex continuum '' approach has been successfully applied to a number of dipping lmxbs including  @xcite .",
    "it assumes that the x - ray emission originates from two components , and the spectral changes during dips are explained by the partial and progressive covering of one of the components by a cool absorber , while the other component is rapidly and entirely covered by another cool absorber .",
    "this approach implies that the latter component comes from a point - like region such as the neutron star surface , whereas the former component comes from a very extended corona .",
    "the improved sensitivity and spectral resolution of _ chandra _ and xmm are allowing narrow absorption features from highly ionized fe and other metals to be observed in a growing number of x - ray binaries . in particular ,  ( he - like ) or  ( h - like ) resonant 1s-2p absorption lines near 7  kev were reported from the micro - quasars ,  and , and from the neutron star systems , , , , ,  and now ( references in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these sources are known to be viewed close to edge - on ( many are dippers ) .",
    "this indicates that the highly ionized plasma probably originates in an accretion disk atmosphere or wind , which could then be a common feature of accreting binaries but preferentially detected in systems viewed close from the disk plane .    here",
    ", we report the detection of  and  absorption lines from the lmxb  and propose a new explanation for the spectral changes between persistent and dipping intervals ( details in * ? ? ?",
    "we further show that this new explanation also applies to all the other bright dipping sources observed by  ( details in * ? ? ?",
    "we analyzed the 50  ks xmm - newton observation of  performed on 2003 january 29 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] ) .",
    "bursts were excluded and one spectrum was extracted for each category of emission : persistent , shallow dipping and deep dipping .  and  1s-2p resonant absorption lines near 7  kev are clearly detected in the persistent spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1323 ]  a top ) , indicating that a highly - ionized disk atmosphere or wind is present in .",
    "absorption lines are also present in the dipping spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1323 ]  a middle and bottom ) indicating that the structure causing the dips ( `` bulge '' hereafter ) is also ionized .",
    "however , clear spectral changes in the lines are visible from persistent to deep dipping : the strength of the  line decreases while that of  increases , indicating that the bulge is less strongly ionized .    for the first time , to account for the absorption features evident near 7  kev , we include a photo - ionized absorber in the spectral model , rather than individual line profiles .",
    "we use the  model of spex , which treats the absorption by a thin slab composed of different ions , located between the ionizing source and the observer .",
    "the processes considered are the continuum and the line absorption by the ions and scattering out of the line - of - sight by the free electrons in the slab .",
    "the relevant ions are automatically taken into account and their relative column densities are coupled in a physical way via a photo - ionization model .",
    "we find that the persistent and dipping spectra are all well fit by a model consisting of a power - law , a blackbody and a broad gaussian emission line , modified by absorption from neutral ( abs ) and ionized ( xabs ) material ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1323 ]  b and c ) .",
    "the ionized plasma has a lower ionization parameter and a larger column density during dipping . in all cases",
    ", it perfectly accounts for the narrow features near 7  kev .",
    "remarkably , it also produces apparent continuum absorption which becomes substantial and strongly energy - dependent during dipping ( compare panels  d in fig .",
    "[ fig:1323 ]  b and c ) . indeed , because the ionization is lower during dipping ,",
    "there is a wider variety of ions than during persistent emission where most of the species are fully stripped of their electrons .",
    "thus many more absorption lines and edges are expected during dipping ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : trans ]  a ) . furthermore , because the column density is larger , the edges are stronger .",
    "this explains the smooth variation of the transmission with energy ( outside the sharp changes at the binding energies themselves ) .",
    "llccc & persistent & shallow dip & deep dip + & @xmath0 & @xmath1 & @xmath2 + & @xmath3 & @xmath4 & @xmath5 + & @xmath6 & @xmath7 & @xmath8 +    [ tab : results ]    by successfully fitting the dipping spectra using the persistent model , but fixing the parameters of the continuum to the persistent values , and allowing only the parameters of the absorbers ( abs and xabs ) to change , we actually demonstrate that the spectral changes from persistent to dipping can be modeled simply by variations in the properties of the neutral and ionized absorbers , with the ionized absorber playing the main role ( table  [ tab : results ] ) .",
    "contrary to the `` complex continuum '' model , the new proposed approach does not require any partial covering and hence does not require the underlying source of x - ray emission to be particularly extended in .",
    "the new explanation further presents the advantage of explaining self - consistently the spectral changes both in the continuum _ and _ the narrow lines .",
    "to test the new proposed explanation for the spectral changes , @xcite analyzed the epic pn data of all the bright dipping binaries observed by : , , , ,  and  ( see  et al . in these proceedings ) .",
    "for each source ( except  whose dips were too shallow for the analysis to be carried out ) , the persistent and dipping spectra were fit together with the parameters of the underlying continuum emission tied together , and the parameters of the absorbers ( one neutral , abs , and one photo - ionized , xabs ) left free to vary .",
    "good fits were obtained for each source ( see the case of  in fig .  [ fig:1916 ] ) .",
    "thus , the changes in the properties of a neutral and of an ionized absorber in the line - of - sight can account for the spectral changes in the continuum and in the narrow features of all the dipping sources that could be tested so far . from persistent to deep dipping , the amount of neutral absorber increases ( fig .",
    "[ fig : multi ]  a ) , corresponding to an increase by a factor @xmath92 in the amount of the local material . at the same time",
    ", the column density of the ionized absorber is found to increase by a factor of 4 to 12 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : multi ]  a ) while its ionization parameter decreases ( fig .  [",
    "fig : multi ]  b ) .",
    "the changes in this ionized material clearly play the main role in explaining the overall energy - dependent spectral changes observed in the dipping sources ( see the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:1916 ]  a and b showing the contribution of the ionized absorber ) .",
    "modeling the spectral changes between persistent and dipping intervals is a powerful means of learning about the bulge and the accretion disk in all the x - ray binaries . until now",
    ", these spectral changes were modeled by invoking absorption of a point - like emission region by a neutral absorber , together with progressive and partial covering of an extended emission region by another neutral absorber .",
    "we propose a novel and simpler explanation invoking a neutral absorber and a photo - ionized absorber .",
    "it was successfully applied to all the bright dipping sources that could be tested to date : , , , ,  and .",
    "no partial covering was needed , indicating that none of the underlying x - ray sources requires to be particularly extended .",
    "the new approach has the strong advantage of explaining self - consistently the spectral changes both in the continuum and in the narrow absorption lines that have been revealed by xmm - newton .",
    "these results suggest a geometry for x - ray binaries such as drawn in fig .  [",
    "fig : trans ]  b. a highly - ionized plasma is present above the accretion disk .",
    "if the binary is viewed relatively close to edge - on , the ionized plasma lies in our line - of - sight toward the x - rays emitted in the vicinity of the compact object , and signatures of the plasma appear in the spectrum , such as the  and  absorption lines in the persistent spectrum of . at the azimuth where the stream of material from the companion star impacts the disk ,",
    "there is material projected at higher altitudes above the disk .",
    "this bulge or thickened part of the disk passes through our line - of - sight during dipping .",
    "contrary to the complex continuum approach , our modeling of the dipping spectra indicates that this material is ionized ( but less than the plasma seen during persistent intervals ) .",
    "it probably contains clumps of neutral material .",
    "the precise distribution of the ionized absorber is unknown .",
    "possibly , from the surface of the disk to higher altitudes , the density of the ionized material decreases and hence its ionization parameter increases . if the ionized absorber is present at the radius of the bulge , its layers could be shifted to higher altitudes .",
    "this could explain the differences observed between persistent and dipping intervals in a given source , and the differences in the absorbers properties observed from source to source , as a function of inclination . in any case , the geometry inferred from the dipping sources should be valid for all the other accreting binaries which only differ from the dipping ones in being viewed further away from the disk plane .",
    "this makes the dipping sources among the best targets to improve our understanding of the disk structure and of the accretion process .",
