    "<S> in this paper we consider the optimal discrimination of two mixed qubit states for a measurement that allows a fixed rate of inconclusive results(frir ) . </S>",
    "<S> our strategy for the problem is to transform the frir of two qubit states into a minimum error discrimination for three qubit states by adding a specific quantum state @xmath0 and a prior probability @xmath1(which we will call an inconclusive degree ) , which we name the modified frir problem . </S>",
    "<S> first , we investigate special inconclusive degrees @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which appear naturally in the modified frir problem and are the beginning and the end of practical interval of inconclusive degree , and find the analytic form of them . </S>",
    "<S> next , we show that the modified frir problem can be classified into two cases @xmath4(or @xmath5 ) and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , by maximum confidences of two qubit states and non - diagonal element of @xmath0 , the modified frir problem is completely understood . </S>",
    "<S> then , we provide an analytic solution of the frir problem when @xmath4(or @xmath5 ) . however , when @xmath6 , we rather supply the numerical method to find the solution , because of the complex relation between inconclusive degree and corresponding failure probability . </S>",
    "<S> finally we confirm our results using previously known examples . </S>"
