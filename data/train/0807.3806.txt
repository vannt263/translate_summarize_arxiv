    "channel polarization is a method , introduced in @xcite , for constructing a class of capacity - achieving codes , called _ polar codes _ , on binary - input symmetric channels .",

    "the parameter @xmath1 is of a more fundamental nature than @xmath13 , however , @xmath13 will play a more central role in the following analysis since it is more readily tractable . a useful pair of inequalities that relate these two parameters are @xmath14 both proved in @xcite .",
