    "most of the galactic supernova remnants ( snrs ) have been identified by their radio , optical and x  ray emission @xcite .",
    "g 39.7@xmath42.0 ( w  50 ) was identified in radio wavelengths by @xcite and first classified as an evolved snr by @xcite .",
    "its radio continuum image has a complex ` seashell ' appearance showing a main spherical shell of non  thermal emission ( @xmath558 arcmin in diameter ) with easterly and westerly extensions or lobes .",
    "the radio spectral index varies across the eastern , central and western areas between values of 0.4 to 0.7 and the total flux densities are 71 jy and 160 jy at 1465 and 327 ghz , respectively @xcite .",
    "the latter authors also presented the latest hi  observations showing some evidence of an interaction between w  50 and its surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) at a velocity @xmath576 km s@xmath6  while a distance to w  50 of @xmath53 kpc was also calculated .",
    "this simple snr interpretation of w  50 is complicated by the presence at its centre of the remarkable stellar binary system ss  433 ( see @xcite for a comprehensive review ) from which emission is ejected in two oppositely directed relativistic jets aligned along the same axis as the elongation of the radio lobes ( see also fig.2 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the two jets are also x  ray emitters ( @xcite ; @xcite ) showing different morphological and spectral properties .",
    "these x  ray and iras @xcite observations suggest that the interaction of ss  433 jets with the surrounding ism plays an important role in the shaping of the envelope .",
    "@xcite measured the distance to the jet of ss  433 , hence w  50 , from radio proper  motion measurements , as 4.61 @xmath2 0.35 kpc and blundell & bowler ( 2004 ) give 5.5 @xmath2 0.2 kpc .",
    "here we will adopt a distance of @xmath3 5 kpc .",
    "optical emission was first discovered by both @xcite and @xcite who found two groups of faint filaments , one east and one west of ss  433 at a distance of @xmath530 arcmin from it .",
    "spectroscopic observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) show that all the optical filaments originated from shock  heated gas since the [ s  ii]/h@xmath7@xmath52 while very strong [ n  ii ]  ( [ n  ii ]  6584   / h@xmath7@xmath53 ) emission is also present .",
    "faint [ o  iii ]  5007  emission was also detected in these spectra ( [ o  iii ]  5007   / h@xmath7@xmath50.4 ) but only from the eastern filaments .",
    "@xcite presented high spectral but low angular ( with 120 arcsec & 200 arcsec beam diameters ) resolution profiles of the [ n  ii ]  6584    line from both the eastern and western optical filaments of w  50 .",
    "these profiles have a complex structure and are broad ( @xmath550 km s@xmath6 ) and see sect .",
    "3.3 for further details and comparison with new line profiles .",
    "a large number of papers have been published ( see the review of @xcite and references therein ) concerning the association of w  50 with ss  433 .",
    "a consensus is emerging that the ss  433 jets have punched holes in a preceding , expanding supernova shell ( e.g. @xcite ) though the formation of the whole structure of w  50 by the jets alone has not been completely ruled out ( @xcite ) .    in the present paper , the first continuum ",
    "subtracted , deep ccd images of the total area of w  50 in the light of h@xmath0[n ii ]  and [ o  iii ]  5007    are presented in a mosaic which covers an area of @xmath8 .",
    "the major eastern and western regions of nebulosity are also imaged at higher angular resolution in the [ o  iii ]  5007    and h@xmath0[n ii ]  6548  &  6584  lines respectively to reveal the fine structure of the optical filaments . furthermore ,",
    "a very deep h@xmath0[n ii ]  6548  &  6584    image of a small region of the northern ridge of radio emission has been obtained in an attempt to detect hitherto undiscovered filamentary nebulosity that would be expected if the w 50 radio shell is a supernova remnant .",
    "the new , faint , optical emission found over w  50 , together , with its comparison with a high resolution radio map , permits a better appreciation of the morphology of w  50 and its interaction with the jets of ss  433 .",
    "in addition , new , deep , low  resolution and spatially  resolved , high  resolution spectra of this optical nebulosity have been obtained to advance the understanding of this interaction .",

    ", we describe the details of these observations .",

    "each of four different fields was observed for 2400 s in both filters while corresponding continuum images were also observed ( 180 s each ) and were subtracted from those containing the emission lines to eliminate the confusing star field ( see @xcite for details of this technique ) .",

    "also we have chosen not to suppress the noise artificially , e.g. by excessive smoothing or lifting the zero level , for this often leads to detection artefacts being confused in the resultant display with real nebulous features .    the image of w  50 with this system is shown in fig .",

    "8 & 10 and section c in figs .",
    "9 & 11 ) emit 22  wide profiles when corrected for instrumental broadening , both centered on  = 56 .",
    "this value is significantly different from  @xmath3 40 which is the mean of the estimation of 28  from the hi  measurements of @xcite and 52  from optical profiles of the eastern and western filaments ( figs 2 & 3 ) given by mazeh et al ( 1983 ) . in the present paper",
    "it has been assumed that for w  50 ,  =  - 14.3 .    however , the fainter [ n  ii ]  6584    emitting regions between the bright eastern filaments exhibit approaching radial velocities of up to 100 with respect to  = 56 .",
    "these faint but extensive high  speed regions are particularly prominent for the sections d and b in fig .",
    "9 whose profiles are shown in fig . 11 .",
    "these high dispersion spectral observations of the eastern filamentary nebulosity were obtained in non - photometric conditions and were not therefore compared photometrically with a standard star .      nearly the same instrumental setup and data analysis as described in sect .",
    "2.2.2 was employed on 1 may 2003 for the longslit spectroscopy of the northern nebulosity shown in fig .",
    "the slit was now 150 @xmath10 m wide ( @xmath20 1.9 arcsec and 9 ) , orientated ns and centred on ra 19h 11 m 00.72s , dec 05@xmath30 19@xmath31 16@xmath32 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the integration time was 4200 s. the position velocity ( pv ) array of [ n  ii ]  6584    profiles obtained in this way are shown in fig .",
    "12 and the line profile for the section marked a in fig .",
    "12 is shown in fig .",
    "this spectral observation was calibrated photometrically against the slitless spectrum of the standard star feige 56 to give a value , uncorrected for interstellar extinction , for the total emission in this [ n  ii ]  6584    profile of 1.9@xmath910@xmath33 erg s@xmath6 @xmath34 arcsec@xmath35 to 20 percent accuracy .",
    "this is @xmath3 29 times fainter in the [ n  ii ]  6584    line than the brightest filament in the eastern nebulosity as listed in table 1 .",
    "the [ n  ii ]  6584    profile is centred on  = 56 @xmath2 2  and 36  wide when simulated by a single gaussian . when corrected for instrumental broadening this width",
    "reduces to 35 .",
    "the h@xmath7/h@xmath21  ratios listed in table 2 strongly indicates that heavy and patchy absorption of optical emission occurs over w  50 .",
    "this is to be expected for a distance of 5 kpc along the galactic plane and for a galactic latitude of only -2.27 .",
    "this possibility is further supported by the isocam infrared emission map of the vicinity of the western filaments obtained by @xcite .",
    "one patch of infrared emission coincides closely with the visible western filaments ( fig .",
    "3a & b and fig .",
    "5 ) but a larger region of infrared emission has no optical counterpart in our images .",
    "it is therefore probable that only parts of the shock  excited optical emission from w  50 is being observed in figs .",
    "25 with considerable parts heavily obscured by the foreground dust .",
    "this patchiness by foreground dust as the cause of the limited detection of the whole of the w  50 optical filaments , which would be expected if this is indeed a supernova remnant , could be confirmed by the optical detection in figs .",
    "6 , 12 & 13 for the first time of the northern radio ridge .",
    "although the latter s optical emission is very much fainter than that observed from the eastern and western optical filaments the [ n  ii ]  6584    profile from it in fig",
    ". 13 is centred on  = 56 .",
    "this matches closely the values in figs .",
    "10 & 11 for the brightest and narrowest profiles of the eastern filamentary nebulosity .",
    "it is suggested that in all of these regions the motions of the emitting gas are nearly perpendicular to the sight  line and that  = 56  could be the best value of the systemic heliocentric radial velocity ,  for the whole ss  433 and w  50 complex . in these circumstances",
    "the optical emission from the northern radio ridge would have to be heavily obscured by the patchy dust .",
    "one complication to this patchy dust interpretation is that the relativistic jet of ss  433 has injected @xmath3 2 @xmath9 10@xmath36 erg into the surrounding medium over its lifetime and could have affected the recombinations rates of the shocked w  50 gas in inpredictable ways .      taken as a whole , the new optical imagery in figs .",
    "25 reveals that the eastern filaments trace a broad arc that is convex with respect to the central source and follows the large scale helical morphology of the w  50 boundary in this vicinity as revealed by radio continuum maps ( @xcite ; see their more detailed maps to appreciate this structure ) .",
    "interestingly , the western filaments seem to curve in an identical sense despite being on the opposite side of ss  433 ( at all wavelengths the morphology of the western ` ear ' is most likely distorted by a strong interaction with a dense portion of the local ism ) .    the bi  polar relativistic jet from ss  433 appears to have broken through diametrically opposite boundaries of the w  50 supernova remnant assuming that this is the origin of large circular region of radio emission in fig .",
    "the bright optical emission ( figs . 2  5 ) then lies at these breakout regions . in an idealised case",
    ", a breakout region should take the form of a ring of emission where the expanding jet envelope shocks the dense shell of swept up and compressed material at the supernova remnant boundary . optical emission from this interaction",
    "is not expected elsewhere because the interior is too hot and rarefied and the ambient medium is too low density ahead of the jet .",
    "the observed arc morphology i.e. eastern and western arcs , could be simply the result of heavy , patchy foreground interstellar absorption ( see sect .",
    "3.1 ) combined with the jet axis being tilted so that the eastern tip is pointing towards the observer and western tip away ( see references in @xcite that confirm this jet orientation ) ; the rings of optical emission become partial ellipses with only localised portions on their nearsides with respect to the observer being visible .",
    "however , the interaction is likely to be much more complex than described above not least because the jet close to ss  433 has a ` corkscrew ' structure .",
    "also @xcite have numerically modelled the w  50/ss  433 system which in their simulations results in reflected and secondary shocks as well as the filling and acceleration of the whole supernova remnant by the jet cocoon .",
    "nonetheless the breakout region remains a distinct zone in the simulations .",
    "all of the spectra in table  2 show clearly that the observed optical emission originates in shock heated gas , since the [ s  ii ]  6717 & 6731   / h@xmath7  @xmath37 1.5 .",
    "the [ o  iii ]  5007    emission detected in both spectra suggests a shock velocity greater than 100 km s@xmath6  ( cox & raymond 1985 ) .",
    "the absolute h@xmath7  flux covers a range of values from 1.4 to 2.6 @xmath9 @xmath38 erg s@xmath6 @xmath34 arcsec@xmath35  and 5.8 to 16.3 @xmath9 @xmath38 erg s@xmath6 @xmath34 arcsec@xmath35  for the western and eastern nebulosities , respectively .",
    "the [ s  ii ]  ratio which was found to be between 1.1 and 1.4 . using ` temden ' in the nebular package in iraf @xcite the electron densities of 50 @xmath39 and",
    "700 @xmath39 are measured for the eastern and western filaments , respectively .",
    "a comparison to shock models shows that the densities are different ( east to west ) by a factor of 10 or more , while the shock velocities are nearly the same .",
    "hence , either there is a huge pressure differential between the two sides ( nt@xmath5pressure ) or there is something incorrect with this interpretation .",
    "furthermore , h@xmath21  emission was detected in both areas ( but with low s / n ) to give [ o  iii ]  5007   / h@xmath21  ratios of between 5.6 ( area ei ) and 15.7 ( area wii ) .",
    "theoretical models of @xcite and @xcite suggest that for shocks with complete recombination zones the expected [ o  iii ]  5007   / h@xmath21  ratio is @xmath56 , while this limit is exceeded in the case of a shock with incomplete recombination zones @xcite .",
    "our measured values suggest in the western nebulosity that shocks with incomplete recombination zones are present while in the eastern nebulosity the presence of shocks with complete recombination zones could not be ruled out .",
    "a combination therefore of the present observations with the theoretical predictions suggests that shock velocities are @xmath17100 km s@xmath6  and @xmath17120 km s@xmath6  for the eastern and western nebulosities respectively , though this difference may not be real when uncertainties in the data are considered .",
    "the previous optical spectra of @xcite at very low angular resolution of the eastern and western filaments suggest that the average heliocentric radial velocities ( ) are , respectively , 65 and 40  ( where the lsr and heliocentric radial velocities are related by  @xmath40  -14.3 ) .",
    "this is in apparent contradiction with the orientation of the jet , which has the eastern portion directed towards the observer .",
    "the radio morphology also indicates that the axis of the elongated lobes of the w 50 shell is tilted to the plane of the sky with the eastern side nearest the observer .",
    "the present spectral observations , with their higher spatial resolution , show that the brightes regions of the eastern filaments ( figs .",
    "811 ) emit the narrowest lines centred on  = 56 but with extensive fainter regions , flowing off the filaments ( fig .",
    "9 ) , composed of high  velocity gas approaching the observer with radial velocities continuously up to 100  from the bright filament value . it remains possible that similar high spatial resolution observations of the western filaments will show similar complex motions and eliminate this discrepancy which could only be a consequence of the low angular resolution employed in the early measurements .",
    "however , the appropriate flows emitting faintly in the eastern filaments are consistent with eastern side of w  50 pointing towards the observer .",
    "also , as noted above , the expected local shock velocities that give rise to the optical filaments are of order 100  and the expansion of the remnant as a whole is estimated by dubner et al ( 1998 ) to be @xmath5  75  .",
    "thus the measured difference in radial velocity between the bright optical filaments is small compared with the expected velocity range ( @xmath5 100  ) .",
    "any residual difference could be explained easily by patchy dust absorption hiding the full extent of the optical emission .",
    "also the contradiction only exists if it is assumed that the optical emission is tracing directly the outflow from the star .",
    "however , the optical emission much more likely traces the interaction between the jet cocoon and the shell of the w  50 snr .",
    "expansion of this shocked optically emitting gas could result in localised flows towards and/or away from the star ( cf .",
    "simulations of @xcite , their figure 3 ) . in the case of the eastern filaments",
    ", the curved morphology could then be a result of an expansion back towards ss  433 whereas the western filaments could be a result of an expansion away from or stationary with respect to ss  433 .",
    "the optical emission then , is concentrated at the  rims \" of the breakout region .",
    "broader , competing , possibilities should also be considered for it has been suggested as above that these elongated breakout features in the radio map are the microquasar jets currently penetrating through the shell of the w  50 snr ( dubner et al . ,",
    "alternatively , these eastern and western radio lobes of the snr may simply be revealing the imprint of the precessing jets of ss  433 , created early in the object s evolution after the explosion of the supernova , and which have inflated along with the rest of the snr as it expanded .",
