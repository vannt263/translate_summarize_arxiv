    "the interest to study of ternary fission was appeared @xcite after the discovery of binary fission of heavy nuclei by various authors .",
    "ternary fission is one of the oldest problem of nuclear reaction but still it has topicality .",
    "authors diehl and greiner @xcite tried to explain ternary fission within the framework of the liquid drop model .",
    "they mainly calculated the potential energy for the prolate and the oblate configurations of the ternary system . also , within the three - center shell model degheidy and maruhn @xcite generalized the phenomenological shell model based on the harmonic oscillator potential to systems with three clusters .",
    "authors showed that the centers of nuclei may be in arbitrary geometrical configurations and nuclei may have different masses .",
    "the experimental work @xcite was dedicated to study of ternary fission of the @xmath0cf nucleus with eight @xmath4 particle telescope . in this experiment , mainly , light charged particles ( like he , be , b etc ) were observed in the coincidence with @xmath5-emission .    the experimental group fobos ( in the flerov laboratory for nuclear reactions of the joint institute for nuclear research , dubna , russia ) made effort to study the unusual mode of ternary fission - collinear cluster tripartition @xcite .",
    "studies of the spontaneous fission products of @xmath0cf in the coincidences with the emitted neutrons has been performed in two missing - mass experiments @xcite .",
    "these experiments demonstrated a new mode of the ternary fission process as a collinear cluster tripartition . at first , in collinear cluster tripartition ( cct ) mode , the masses of nuclei are comparable , and nuclei are especially clusters , i.e. with a magic number of mass ( or charge ) . at second ,",
    "the collinearity of the momenta of the ternary fission fragments is proved by the fact that the two detectors registering sn and ni - like fragments are placed on the opposite sides from the fissioning source @xmath0cf such that angle between them is @xmath6 .",
    "the probability of the yield of ni and sn nuclei are observed was approximately @xmath7 times less then the one of binary fission .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite concluded that middle fragment is calcium nucleus .",
    "this mode of ternary fission differs from usual ternary fission which is binary fission with the emission of light fragments ( he , li , be etc . ) as the third ( middle ) nucleus in the perpendicular plane to the fission axis .",
    "moreover some theoretical works dedicated to this kind of ternary fission have been published @xcite . in the ref .",
    "@xcite the ternary fission of @xmath0cf has been studied through the potential energy surfaces for two different arrangements in a collinear configuration , and authors concluded that true ternary fission ( with almost equal fragment mass ) is energetically possible due to the minima in the fragmentation potential energy and high @xmath8-values .",
    "also , in this method it is shown that collinear geometry with the lightest fragment between two heavier nuclei is expected to give the highest probabilities in the decay .    in our previous works @xcite the possible channels of true ternary fission were studied . in the ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that more possible channel of ternary fission in the @xmath0cf(sf ) reaction is @xmath1ni+@xmath2ca+@xmath3sn which is theoretically proven in the ref .",
    "@xcite . our experience from the previous works @xcite leads to the interesting question : how does tri - nuclear system evaluate during its decay ?",
    "because in those works it was not proven that the momenta of fission products are collinear or not . in this work",
    "it is decided to study the dynamical changing of relative distance between nuclei and their velocities .",
    "so , the main aim of current work is to study of dynamics of fission of the @xmath1ni+@xmath2ca+@xmath3sn system , in other words to check is the ternary fission collinear or not .",
    "certainly , to get information about dynamics an equation of motion should be solved .",
    "results of solution of the equation of motion depend on initial conditions .",
    "the dependence of the result on the initial condition is studied in detail to find the collinear flying of the ternary fission products .",
    "thus from results it will be easy to know what initial condition leads to collinear fission .",
    "the theoretical model is based on the formation of the tri - nuclear system ( tns ) .",
    "the tns is the system which has three interacting nuclei @xcite , and its interaction is studied on the basis of the dinuclear system model @xcite .",
    "the stage proceeding to formation of the tns is not studied .",
    "it is assumed that the system is formed , and any ternary fission of heavy nuclei passes through the tns stage .    ) and relative ( @xmath9 ) vectors of tri - nuclear system .",
    "the point @xmath10 ( origin ) corresponds to the center of mass.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    the main task is obtaining the classical lagrange equations of motion , and solving them .",
    "first of all , the lagrangian is @xmath11 , where @xmath12 - kinetic energy of the system , @xmath13 - total interaction potential between fragments .",
    "following system of equations can be written from the fig .",
    "[ graph1 ] :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) are point vectors of nuclei and the magnitude of a vector @xmath9 is the relative distance between the i@xmath17 and j@xmath17 nuclei .",
    "it is clear that any kind of fission process occurs in one plane , i.e. it can be chosen the 2d space where fission fragments move .",
    "so any @xmath18 vector can be described only with @xmath19 and @xmath20 components ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) in the cartesian system .",
    "correspondingly , velocities are defined as @xmath23 and @xmath24 , therefore , the kinetic energy can be written as    @xmath25      in the framework of the classical lagrange formalism 3 equations of motion for the @xmath19 variable and 3 for the @xmath20 variable can be obtained : @xmath26    it is clear that the kinetic energy does not depend on a distance @xmath27 , i.e. @xmath28 .",
    "therefore ,    @xmath29    the magnitude of a @xmath9 vector is @xmath30 .",
    "potential energy @xmath13 depends only on relative distance @xmath31 ( or @xmath32 ) .",

    "it means that @xmath41 and @xmath42 is found as    @xmath43    as the origin is placed at the center of mass so there is no `` @xmath44 '' term in the definition of @xmath42 .",

    "the collinearity of the momenta of the tri - partition is determined by the dynamics of the middle fragment @xmath2ca since the heavier fragment @xmath3sn is separated firstly and then the middle fragment separates from @xmath1ni .",

    "[ graph8 ] .",

    "it means the detecting the middle nucleus ( ca ) is almost impossible in an experiment .",

    "[ graph9 ] .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the deviation of the location of calcium nucleus on 0.5 fm on @xmath20-axis from the origin is enough to get non collinear fission .",
    "moreover , the sequence of the non collinear fission is similar to the one of the collinear fission : at first sn is separated from ni+ca , then , ni+ca system is broken up .",

    "but the initial velocity of the middle fragment is @xmath88  cm / ns , and other initial velocities are zero : @xmath89 .",
    "[ graph10 ] shows that if @xmath20 component of the initial velocity of the ca nucleus is not zero , ternary fission will be non collinear .",

    "[ graph8].,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    from the figures it can be concluded that there is collinear fission only when all three nuclei are located in one line ( @xmath91 ) and there is not @xmath20 component of the initial velocity of the middle fragment ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "we conclude that if in the pre - scission stage all nuclei are placed collinearly which corresponds to the minimum in the potential energy surface and there is no the net force on the third nucleus ( ca ) on y - axis ( or @xmath20 component of its initial velocity is zero ) , then the tri - nuclear system can be broken up collinearly .",
    "this theoretical result proves the experimental results of the collinear cluster tripartition in the ref .",
    "the experiment shows that collinear ternary fission can be observed .",
    "therefore , in the framework of the tns model the initial condition which leads to collinear fission have a place in the nature .    from the comparison of the potential energy surfaces in the figs .",
    "[ graph2]-[graph7 ] it can be concluded that as @xmath73 ( relative distance between ni and sn nuclei ) increases the minimum at the point when @xmath74 fm and @xmath75 fm in the fig .",
    "[ graph2 ] is disappeared , and instead of this minimum the saddle point is emerged ( see fig . [ graph7 ] ) .",
    "it means the tns with value of @xmath73 higher then 22 fm is an unstable system .    moreover , from the figs .",
    "[ graph9 ] and [ graph10 ] as conclusion it can be emphasized that non collinear ternary fission occurs in the following initial conditions : the deviation in y - axis of location from the origin of the middle ( ca ) nucleus or the difference from zero of the @xmath20 component of the velocity of that nucleus .    nevertheless , it is interesting that in all cases the decay time of the tns has nearly the same value .",
    "it means the time almost does not depend on initial conditions .",
    "it is because of the sequence of the fission : firstly , sn nucleus is separated from the ni+ca system , and then ni is decayed from ca nucleus .    as the collinearity of the ternary fission depends on initial conditions so the probability ( or the weight ) of the each initial condition s population is the open question which will be studied in future investigations .",
