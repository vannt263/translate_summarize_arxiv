    "due in large part to insights gained from hydrodynamical simulations of structure formation in the universe ( cen 1994 ; zhang , anninos & norman 1995 ; hernquist 1996 ; zhang 1997 ; bond & wadsley 1997 ; theuns , leonard & efstathiou 1998 ) the forest , as measured in high redshift quasi - stellar object ( qso ) spectra , has emerged as one of our premier probes of the universe at high redshift .",
    "the results of simulations assuming early homogeneous and reionization reproduce the cumulative flux distributions and column density distributions measured from high resolution spectra to an accuracy of a few percent ( meiksin , bryan & machacek 2001 ) .",
    "more problematic are the predicted widths of the absorption features , which appear to require additional sources of broadening , perhaps late reionization , to match the measured widths ( theuns 1999 ; bryan & machacek 2000 ; meiksin 2001 ) .",
    "parallel to the development of the full hydrodynamical simulations of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) are pseudo - hydrodynamical schemes using pure gravity ( petitjean , mcket & kates 1995 ; croft 1998 ; gnedin & hui 1998 ; meiksin & white 2001 ) .",
    "these simpler treatments are based on two key results from the full hydrodynamical computations . as a consequence of photoionization equilibrium :  1 .",
    "the gas follows a tight temperature  density relation for the absorbing material with the neutral hydrogen temperature proportional to the baryon density to the power of @xmath7 ( zhang 1998 ; schaye 1999 ) , and 2 .",
    "the neutral hydrogen density closely traces the total matter density on the scales relevant to the forest ( @xmath8mpc ) ( zhang 1998 ) .",
    "the structure in qso absorption thus tracks , in a calculable way , slight fluctuations in the matter density of the universe back along the line of sight to the qso , with most of the absorption by the forest arising from gas with overdensities of a few times the mean density .",
    "although these techniques are not sufficiently accurate to be used for detailed modelling of the flux and absorption line properties of the igm ( meiksin & white 2001 ) , they provide a useful means of investigating convergence questions and the possible role of additional physical effects on the forest without the substantial overhead of the full hydrodynamical treatment . in particular , in recent years",
    "they have been increasingly relied on for predicting the flux power spectrum of the forest ( meiksin & white 2001 ; zaldarriaga , hui & tegmark 2001 ; croft 2002b ; seljak , mcdonald & makarov 2003 ) .",
    "while much work has been done on the physics of the forest and the cosmology which may be extracted , the role of fluctuations in the uv background on the absorption properties of the forest are largely unexplored ( see zuo 1992a , b ; fardal & shull 1993 ; croft et al .",
    "1999 , 2002a ; gnedin & hamilton 2002 ) .",
    "the effects of fluctuations in the uv background on the statistical properties of the forest were considered previously by zuo ( 1992a , b ) and zuo & phinney ( 1993 ) .",
    "zuo & bond ( 1994 ) introduced the use of the flux transmission auto - correlation function for measuring the clustering of the absorbing gas , although they did not consider the effect of fluctuations in the uv background apart from a local proximity effect . as we shall show , the effects of uv background correlations are most conspicuous only at high redshifts ( @xmath5 ) , where the precise level of absorption by the forest is most difficult to measure because of the extremely low flux values , requiring very high signal - to - noise ratio spectra .",
    "fardal & shull ( 1993 ) explored the effects of uv background fluctuations on the forest along the lines of zuo , but using monte carlo realisations of randomly distributed sources and clouds to estimate the effect of the background fluctuations .",
    "croft et al .",
    "( 1999 ) estimated the flux power spectrum resulting from uv background fluctuations generated by randomly distributed qso sources in a uniform igm , and found this to be small , at the few percent level , compared with the flux power spectrum from the forest at @xmath9 .",
    "they found that allowing for qso clustering had little additional effect .",
    "croft ( 2002a ) accounted for the uv background fluctuations at @xmath10 assuming the igm was ionized by the galaxies in their simulation , and concluded again the effect on the flux power spectrum is small .",
    "finally gnedin & hamilton ( 2002 ) examined the effect of a fluctuating uv background at @xmath11 using hydro simulations with pseudo - radiative transfer , assuming the reionization is accomplished by galaxies in their simulation .",
    "they concluded the fluctuations of the uv background affect the flux power spectrum at the percent level , but cause an underestimate of the photo - ionization rate by @xmath12 .",
    "a comparable boost in the photo - ionization rate is required if qsos are the dominant source of the uv background at @xmath13 ( paper i ) .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the effect of the fluctuations on the 2-pt flux distribution ( the power spectrum and auto - correlation function ) of the forest .",
    "this extends our earlier work on the 1-pt distribution function reported in meiksin & white ( 2003 ; hereafter paper i ) . in the next section",
    "we describe the simulations used . in section 3 , we discuss our model for the uv background fluctuations .",
    "the results are presented in section 4 , and we summarise our conclusions in section 5 . in appendix",
    "a we discuss the numerical convergence tests we ve performed , and we describe our estimates of the mean flux in appendix b.",

    "we estimate the mean flux from each spectrum over a narrow redshift interval ( @xmath27 ) centred at each redshift considered , and average the results , adopting the error in the mean as our error estimate .",
    "we also allow for small systematic offsets in the continuum level ( typically 14% ) , as provided by meiksin for the two best - fitting models to the flux distribution ( which are @xmath28cdm models similar to those considered in this paper ) .",
    "we estimate the error in the systematic offset from the spread between the best - fitting models ( 12% of the continuum level ) , and add this linearly to the error in the mean .",
    "( since the error is systematic rather than statistical , adding the error in quadrature would be inappropriate . )    for @xmath29 , we adopt the value of mcdonald ( 2000 ) of @xmath30 . for @xmath31",
    ", we use the best - fit of songaila & cowie ( 2002 ) to the measured redshift trend ( their eq.[19 ] ) , to obtain a value for the mean flux of 0.47 .",
    "we also linearly extrapolate the values of songaila & cowie ( 2002 ) at @xmath32 and 4.07 down to @xmath31 , obtaining a mean flux of @xmath33 .",
    "the difference appears due to a single outlying measurement which substantially lowers the mean .",
    "we shall consider both values , noting that the larger one better matches the trend in table  [ tab : fluxa ] .    for comparison",
    ", we also show the estimates , using the above procedure as applied to the fit to @xmath34 of press , based on similar estimates from kim , cristiani & dodorico ( 2001 ) with @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( which we infer from their error estimates for @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) , and the fit by zhang , anninos , norman & meiksin ( 1997 ) to the flux decrement values ( @xmath39 ) of steidel & sargent ( 1987 ) , @xmath40 , @xmath41 ( fixed ) .",
    "the errors provided correspond to the equivalent @xmath42 gaussian errors , as described above .",
    "the results are tabulated in table  [ tab : fluxa ] .",
    "all the estimates are found to be in accord , including those of press this is noteworthy in that the estimates that had been made using the best value for @xmath34 from press generally gave values significantly higher than measured using high resolution spectra . estimating the mean flux including the errors as we have done shows that these results are actually in agreement with the estimates from the higher resolution data .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the estimates based on the moderate resolution data of steidel & sargent are nearly identical to those using the @xmath34 fit of kim , which is based on a compilation of several high resolution spectra .",
    "the agreement in the determinations of the mean flux between the moderate and high resolution spectra suggests that moderate resolution spectra , like those of the sloan digital sky survey , should , in principle , be adequate for measuring the mean flux . at attempt to measure the mean flux from the sloan qso survey",
    "was made by bernardi ( 2003 ) .",
    "the values found at @xmath43 , 2.75 , 3.0 and 3.89 are , respectively ( as given in their fig .",
    "21 ) , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "these all lie systematically low compared with the values listed in table  [ tab : fluxa ] .",
    "the reasons for the discrepancy are unclear .    since the mean flux is the quantity of interest for normalising the forest simulations , we use direct measurements of the mean flux to normalise our simulations rather than estimates of the mean optical depth . historically , @xmath34 was of interest in the context of models for which the absorption was produced by discrete aborption clouds rather than modulations in a continuous medium . for the purposes of studies of the igm under the current continuum model of its structure ,",
    "@xmath34 has lost most of its significance ; the mean flux is almost always to be preferred .",
    "an exception is in estimating the contribution of known discrete systems to the mean flux .",
    "of particular interest is the contribution from damped absorbers ( dlas ) .",
    "the contribution of discrete absorption systems to @xmath34 is given by ( eg , meiksin & madau 1993 ; prs ) @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the equivalent width corresponding to a system with column density @xmath50 , and @xmath51 is the ( rest ) wavelength of the transition . here , @xmath52 is the column density distribution at redshift @xmath53 , assumed to vary slowly over the width of an absorption feature .",
    "the @xmath50 distribution is estimated to be a power law @xmath54 with @xmath55 , with a possible high @xmath50 cut - off ( storrie - lombardi , irwin & mcmahon 1996 ) . since dlas are on the square - root part of the curve of growth ( @xmath56 ) , @xmath57 is logarithmically divergent at the upper end .",
    "even if the distribution steepens at the upper end , as suggested by storrie - lombardi , the statistics are so poor that the contribution of dlas to @xmath34 is highly uncertain .",
    "seljak claim to have adjusted their error estimate of @xmath34 to allow for dlas , although they give no details of their procedure . in view of the uncertainty in @xmath57 ,",
    "the most reliable approach is to use only spectral regions that are clean of dla contamination to estimate the mean flux ."
