    "graphene , a single layer of carbon atoms laid out in a honeycomb lattice , is one of the most interesting electronic systems discovered in recent years @xcite .",
    "it differs from conventional two dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) systems in that the low energy physics is governed by a massless dirac hamiltonian rather than the more common form used for semiconductors , characterized by an effective mass and a band gap .",
    "the tunneling of dirac fermions in graphene has already been verified experimentally  @xcite , which in turn has spurred an extraordinary amount of interest in the investigation of the electronic transport properties in graphene based quantum wells , barriers , @xmath8-@xmath9 junctions , transistors , quantum dots , superlattices , @xmath10 etc .",
    "the electrostatic barriers in graphene can be generated in various ways  @xcite , by applying a gate voltage , cutting it into finite width nanoribbons and using doping or otherwise .",
    "on the other hand , magnetic barrier could in principle  @xcite be realized with the creation of magnetic dots . in the case of graphene ,",
    "results of the transmission coefficient and the tunneling conductance were already reported for the electrostatic barriers ,  @xcite , magnetic barriers ,  @xcite and potential barrier  @xcite .",
    "the fact that in an ideal graphene sheet the carriers are massless gives rise to klein paradox , which allows particles to tunnel through any electrostatic potential barriers , that is the wavefunction has an oscillatory tail outside the electrostatic barrier region .",
    "hence this property excludes the possibility to confine electrons using electrostatic gates , as in usual semiconductors . thus to enable the fabrication of confined structures , such as quantum dots , we need to use other type of potential coupling such as the vector potential coupling considered in the present work .",
    "more precisely , we will use two methods , one numerical ( poincar map )  @xcite and the other analytical , in the prospect of studying the tunneling of dirac fermions through a biased graphene strip .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe our theoretical model hamiltonian and apply the poincar map approach , based on the space discretization of the effective 1d dirac equation . in section 3",
    ", we expose the direct analytical approach to solve the same problem . in section 4",
    ", we proceed to discuss the numerical implementation of our approaches to a specific model potential , the linear potential which generates a static electric field , and make a comparative study between the two approaches .",
    "before we embark on the two approaches mentioned above , we would like to describe mathematically our system of massless dirac fermions within a strip of graphene characterized by a very large length scale , and a width @xmath11 in the presence of the applied linear potential @xmath12 between @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "so our system is composed of three major regions : the extremes @xmath15 and @xmath16 contain intrinsic graphene free of any external potentials and an intermediate region @xmath17 subject to the applied linear potential @xmath12 .",
    "graphene band structure has two fermi points , each with a two - fold band degeneracy , and can be described by a tight binding hamiltonian describing two interlacing honeycomb sublattices . at low energies this hamiltonian can be can be described by a continuum approximation to the original tight binding model which reduces to the two dimensional dirac equation with a four - component envelope wavefunction whose components are labeled by a fermi - point pseudospin @xmath18 .",
    "specifically , the hamiltonian for one - pseudospin component for the present system can be written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the fermi velocity and @xmath21 are the pauli matrices .",
    "hereafter we set our units such that @xmath22 .",
    "the linear potential @xmath12 has the following form @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the strength of the static electric field .",
    "this potential configuration is shown in figure  1 below .",
    "+    our system is supposed to have a finite width @xmath11 with infinite mass boundary conditions for the wavefunction at the boundaries @xmath25 and @xmath26 along the @xmath27-direction  @xcite .",
    "this boundary condition results in a quantization of the transverse momentum along the @xmath27-direction , which gives @xmath28 one can therefore assume a spinor solution of the following form @xmath29 where the superscript @xmath30 , indicates the space region while the subscripts indicate the two spinor components .",
    "thus our problem reduces to an effective 1d problem whose dirac equation can be written as @xmath31 due to the space dependence of the potential @xmath12 we make the following transformation on our spinor components to enable us to obtain schrodinger like equations for each component , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , which obey the coupled stationary equations .",
    "these are @xmath34 each spinor component @xmath35 can be shown to satisfy the following uncoupled second order differential equation @xmath36 ^{2 } -{k_y}^{2 } \\right ) \\chi_{{{1,2}}}^{j } \\left ( x \\right)=0.\\ ] ]    in this section we will apply the poincar map approach to solve the above effective 1d dirac equation . in this approach",
    "we start by subdividing the potential interval @xmath37 into @xmath38 regions ( figure 1 ) . in every @xmath9-th region",
    "we approximate the linear potential by a constant value @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "hence , the dirac equation in each region ( @xmath9 ) , defined by @xmath42 , can be easily solved for the piece - wise constant potential . for simplicity",
    ", we chose the incident wave propagating from right to left and apply the continuity of the spinor wavefunctions at the boundary separating adjacent regions .",
    "the general solutions of equation ( [ df ] ) in the @xmath9-th region where @xmath43 are given by @xmath44 with @xmath45 , the complex number @xmath46 is defined by @xmath47 . in order to obtain the relationship between @xmath48 and @xmath49 we apply continuity of @xmath50 at the boundary @xmath51 ( figure 2 ) .",
    "this leads to @xmath52 also @xmath53 and @xmath54 are related by @xmath55     +    using the above results we can write the desired poincar map as @xmath56 where we have defined a simplified notation by @xmath57 and @xmath58 , or more explicitly @xmath59    to make use of the above poincar map in solving our scattering problem we need to define our incident , reflected and transmitted waves . for @xmath60",
    "where @xmath61 ( region i ) , we can use for our transmitted spinor evaluated at @xmath62 , the suitably normalized form @xmath63 this is juste the value of the transmitted wave at the zeroth site , @xmath64 @xmath65 , which is given by @xmath66 on the other side , for @xmath67 where @xmath68 ( region iii ) , we have both incident and reflected spinor waves .",
    "just outside the potential region on the right hand side in the @xmath69-th region the spinor wave can be written as @xmath70 hence to evaluate the transmission amplitude all we need is to find @xmath71 using the above recursive scheme .",
    "our strategy now is to express @xmath71 in terms of @xmath72 and @xmath73 , the two end point spinors .",
    "this can be easily done using our previous relationships and leads to @xmath74 from the above notation we can easily define the transmission amplitude as follows @xmath75 summing up , our numerical procedure requires first that we iterate the poincar map ( [ grindeq16 ] ) to obtain the end point spinors , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , in terms of the normalized transmitted spinor .",
    "these spinors will then be injected in ( [ grindeq21 ] ) and ( [ grindeq9 ] ) to determine the transmission amplitude .",
    "the transmission coefficient is given by @xmath76 .",
    "the numerical implementation of this scheme in the case of linear vector potential will be done in section 4 .",
    "in this section we implement our previous poincar map and analytical approaches to a nanoribbon system subject to an electric potential of strength @xmath99 and a field region of length @xmath100 so that the resulting static electric field strength is given by @xmath101 , respectively . in figure 3",
    "we show the transmission as a function of energy for a transverse momentum @xmath102 .",
    "the solid lines corresponds to the exact transmission derived in section 3 and given by equation ( [ tt ] ) while the dashed lines are generated by our poincar map for @xmath103 iterations , the agreement is just perfect .",
    "+        figure 3 shows the concordance between the results generated by the analytical and poincar map method we adapted .",
    "we note that below a certain critical energy @xmath104 the transmission is almost zero , then it starts oscillations whose frequency increases with @xmath37 , the size of the region subject to the electric field . the transmission increases with @xmath37 and reaches unity for energies above @xmath105 .",
    "figure 4 shows the transmission as a function of the strength of the applied voltage , total transmission is observed for small values of @xmath106 less than the energy of the incident fermion .",
    "it then decreases sharply for @xmath107 until it reaches a relative minimum and then begins to increase in an oscillatory manner .",
    "we notice in both figures 3 and 4 that the amplitude of oscillations and period increase as we decrease the size of the electric field region , @xmath37 .",
    "figure 5 shows that the effect of the transverse momentum @xmath108 on transmission , is antagonistic to that of length @xmath37 .",
    "but it should be pointed out that the number of oscillations increases as @xmath108 decreases and the curves for different values of @xmath108 do not intersect .",
    "now we would point out that our effective 1d massless dirac equation is equivalent to a massive one with an effective mass equal to the transverse quantized wave vector @xmath109 .",
    "for this purpose we would like to consider a unitary transformation , which enable us to map the effective 1d ( equation ( [ 1d ] ) ) into a 1d massive dirac equation .",
    "such a unitary transformation does not affect the energy spectrum or the physics of the problem .",
    "we choose a rotation by @xmath110 about the @xmath27-axis , @xmath111 .",
    "thus , the transformed hamiltonian and wavefunction read @xmath112 which is identical to a 1d massive dirac equation with an effective mass @xmath113 . to check the validity of this assertion numerically we show in figure 6 the transmission as a function of energy as generated by the exact analytical result ( [ tt ] ) , the poincar map ( [ grindeq9 ] ) and the 1d massive dirac equation with an effective mass @xmath114 in ( [ masse ] ) .",
    "we see from this figure that the three curves coincide to the point that we can not even distinguish between them .",
    "this lead us to include an inset in figure 6 showing each figure translated for ease of comparison purposes .",
    "this last figure confirms , numerically , the equivalence between a one - dimensional system of dirac fermions with mass and a two - dimensional system of massless dirac fermions constrained along the @xmath27-direction by an infinite mass boundary condition , hence forming a graphene nanoribbon .",
    "the transverse component of the wave vector , @xmath108 , played the role of an effective mass @xcite in the resulting effective 1d dirac equation .",
