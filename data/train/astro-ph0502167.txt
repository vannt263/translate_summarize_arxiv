    "the first ever stellar trigonometric parallax was reported by f. bessel in 1838 for 61 cygni , after a `` race '' in which he narrowly defeated f. g. wilhelm struve and t. henderson , who published the parallaxes for vega and @xmath4 centauri , respectively , in the next year . since then , trigonometric parallax measurements have provided one of the most important parameters for understanding stellar astronomy  distance  and provide one of the sturdiest rungs on the cosmic distance ladder .",
    "trigonometric parallaxes are used to derive the intrinsic luminosities of stars , calculate accurate masses for binary system components , and answer questions about stellar populations and galactic structure .",
    "in addition , the solar neighborhood is mapped out via trigonometric parallaxes , and these nearby objects provide the brightest examples of many stellar types , supplying the benchmarks to which more distant stars are compared .",
    "two of the most important parallax references are the yale parallax catalog @xcite and hipparcos catalog @xcite .",
    "combined , they offer @xmath5120,000 parallaxes both from space and ground observations . of these ,",
    "92% of trigonometric parallaxes are from the hipparcos mission . however , because of the relatively bright magnitude limit of hipparcos , many nearby stars candidates were excluded .",
    "consequently , the faint members of the solar neighborhood are under - presented , and these faint red , brown , and white dwarfs are the objects targeted by recent trigonometric parallax efforts , including the one discussed in this paper .",
    "recent results for nearby red and brown dwarfs include the efforts of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , which together have provided @xmath5130 total ground - based parallaxes since 1995 .",
    "in order to recover `` missing '' members in the solar neighborhood , the research consortium on nearby stars ( recons ) group is currently carrying out a southern sky parallax survey known as cerro tololo inter - american observatory parallax investigation ( ctiopi ) .",
    "the primary goals of ctiopi are to discover and characterize nearby red , brown , and white dwarfs that remain unidentified in the solar neighborhood .",
    "this program was selected as a noao survey program , and observations commenced in 1999 august .",
    "ctiopi used both 0.9-m and 1.5-m telescopes during the noao survey program , and has continued on the 0.9-m as part of the smarts ( small and moderate aperture research telescope system ) consortium beginning in 2003 february .",
    "the recons team at georgia state university is responsible for data reduction for the 0.9-m program , while data from the 1.5-m program is being analyzed by e. costa and r. mndez of the universidad de chile in santiago .",
    "the extended 0.9-m program has recently surpassed 400 systems on the observing list , while the final 1.5-m program included @xmath550 systems that were fainter ( and for which less observing time was awarded ) .",
    "most of the target stars ( hereafter , the `` pi stars '' ) are selected for ctiopi because available astrometric ( e.g , high proper motion ) , photometric , or spectroscopic data indicate that they might be closer than 25 pc . in the 0.9-m program , roughly 95% of the pi stars are red dwarfs and the remainder are white dwarfs .",
    "the fainter brown dwarf candidates were included in the 1.5-m program . in all , @xmath530% of the 0.9-m targets are members of what we call the motion sample  stellar systems having proper motions of at least 10/yr .",
    "this paper describes the first definitive astrometric results of ctiopi , focusing on the results for 36 motion systems .",
    "the 0.9-m telescope is equipped with a 2048 @xmath6 2048 tectronix ccd camera with 0401/pixel plate scale @xcite .",
    "all observations were made using the central quarter of the chip , yielding a 68 square field of view , through @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 filters ( hereafter , the subscripts are not given ) johnson , kc @xmath2 kron - cousins .",
    "the central wavelengths for @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are 5475 , 6425  and 8075 , respectively . ] .",
    "the dewar containing the ccd camera is mounted on the telescope with columns oriented in the north - south direction .",
    "a slight rotation relative to the sky is possible because of instrument flexure and repositioning during telescope maintenance .",
    "this rotation angle can be calibrated , as discussed in section  [ astro.initial.steps ] .",
    "the observing procedures employed during ctiopi mimic those used in university of virginia southern parallax program at the siding spring observatory in australia , led by p. ianna , who is a member of the ctiopi team .",
    "when a star is observed for the first time , exploratory exposures are taken in the @xmath10 filters to find a suitable set of reference stars in the field . the parallax filter and position of the field",
    "are selected to balance the brightness of the pi star with available potential reference stars , and that filter is used for all subsequent parallax frames . because most of our pi stars are nearby star candidates , they are brighter than most of the field stars .",
    "we attempt to place the pi star on the chip so that 5 to 15 field stars of adequate flux can be included .",
    "typically , a good reference star is not more than twice as bright as the pi star ( in the few cases when the pi star is not the brightest star in the field ) , but has at least 1000 peak counts during a typical parallax exposure .",
    "bias frames and dome flats are taken at the beginning of each night to allow for basic data reduction calibration .",
    "parallax observations are usually made within @xmath330 minutes of a pi star s transit in order to minimize the corrections required for differential color refraction ( dcr ) corrections , which are discussed in section  [ dcr ] .",
    "a few faint pi stars are observed with a wider hour angle tolerance because frame acquisition takes longer .",
    "exposure times for parallax frames typically provide a peak of @xmath550,000 counts for the pi star ( saturation occurs at 65,535 counts ) , in an effort to maximize the number of counts available for pi star and reference star centroiding .",
    "usually , 310 frames are taken in each visit , depending primarily on the exposure time required .",
    "multiple frames are taken to reduce the errors on the pi star and reference star positions at each observation epoch .",
    "the typical set of observations required to determine a final parallax and proper motion includes four seasons of observations carried out over at least 2.5 years ( further details in section  [ pi.quality.check ] ) .",
    "the @xmath10 photometry reported here was acquired at the ctio 0.9-m utilizing the same instrument setup used for the astrometry frames .",
    "all of the results are from observations taken between november 1999 and september 2004 . as with the astrometry observations ,",
    "bias and dome flat images were acquired nightly and used for basic science frame calibration .",
    "most pi stars were observed at @xmath11 @xmath12 1.8 or less ( a few were between 1.8 and 2.0 airmasses because of extreme northern or southern declinations ) .",
    "various exposure times were used to reach s / n @xmath13 100 for pi stars in each of the @xmath10 filters .",
    "standard star fields with averagely total 10 stars from @xcite and/or e - regions from @xcite were observed several times each night to derive transformation equations and extinction curves .",
    "in addition , one or two very red standard stars with @xmath14 3.7 were observed in order to derive extinction coefficients for stars with a wide range of colors .",
    "typically , a total of 45 standard star fields were observed 23 times each per night .",
    "the basic data reduction for the astrometry ccd frames includes overscan correction , bias subtraction and flat - fielding , performed using a customized iraf package called _ redpi _ ( because our pi stars are primarily red dwarfs ) .",
    "after processing the raw data , frames are sorted into storage directories by object until there are enough parallax frames and time coverage to derive a reliable astrometric solution , typically at least 40 frames over at least two years . when sufficient frames are available , _ sextractor _",
    "@xcite is used to determine centroids for each pi star and a set of reference stars that is chosen using the following general guidelines :    1 .",
    "a single frame is selected that was taken using the parallax filter .",
    "the seeing is required to be better than 15 and images must have ellipticity less than @xmath520% .",
    "five to 15 reference stars in the field are selected that evenly surround the pi star in order to determine reliable plate rotation , translation , and scaling coefficients .",
    "3 .   each reference star must have a complete set of @xmath10 photometry , which is required for dcr corrections and the conversion of relative to absolute parallax .",
    "4 .   using the iraf _ imexam _ task ,",
    "each reference star is checked to make sure that it is not a resolved binary or galaxy .",
    "ideally , all of the reference stars are have peak counts above 1000 , although some fields require the selection of fainter stars in order to have a sufficient number of reference stars .",
    "after the first round of parallax reductions , each reference star is reexamined for a sizable parallax or proper motion , and removed from the reference field if necessary .    in order to calculate the parallax factors , accurate coordinates and a value for the earth to solar system barycenter distance",
    "need to be known .",
    "the coordinates used for parallax factor calculations are extracted from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) all - sky point source catalog via oasis . because these objects are high proper motion stars , all of them were manually identified by comparison with finding charts instead of retrieving data blindly by setting a searching radius around a given ra and dec .",
    "the coordinates listed in table  [ tbl : pi.result ] for the pi stars have been shifted to epoch 2000 using available proper motion measurements , primarily @xcite , instead of the epoch at which the images were taken by 2mass . to compute an accurate distance from the earth to the solar system barycenter at the time of observation , the jpl ephemeris de405 is used .    before calculating the parallax and proper motion of the pi star using frames taken at many epochs",
    ", a single `` trail plate '' is selected as a fundamental reference frame to which all other images are compared .",
    "this trail plate is used to remove any rotation , translation , and scaling changes between frames .",
    "a customized program organizes the set of frames used during the reductions for a particular field , is run to calculate the hour angle , parallax factors , and fwhm of images for each frame , and a trail plate is selected using the results , using the following criteria :    1 .",
    "all reference stars and pi star(s ) have peak counts less than 65500 and greater than 100",
    "all reference stars and pi star(s ) have ellipticity less than @xmath520% .",
    "all the reference stars and pi star(s ) have fwhm less than 25 .",
    "this criterion has been relaxed relative to the frame used for the initial selection of reference stars ( when 15 is the limit ) in order for the trail plate to be nearly coincident with the meridian .",
    "the hour angle is within 2 minutes of the meridian at the midpoint of the integration .",
    "a frame taken very near the meridian provides a trail plate with minimal dcr .    usually , the definitive trail plate is the one having the smallest hour angle and best seeing of the frames available .",
    "the rotation angle of the trail plate is calculated relative to the guide star catalog 2.2 ( gsc2.2 ) using wcstools / imwcs .",
    "our parallax images are usually deeper than gsc2.2 , so stellar objects with apparent magnitudes brighter than 18.0 and fwhm smaller than 25 ( but larger than 06 to avoid centroiding on cosmic rays and bad pixels ) are used . once the rotation angle is determined , the parallax factors and centroids for all reference stars and pi stars on the trail plate are recalculated and used as the fundamental reference frame .",
    "dcr corrections are required because the pi star and reference stars are not of identical color ; therefore , their positions as seen from underneath earth s atmosphere shift relative to one another because of different , but calibrateable amounts of refraction .",
    "although most of our parallax observations suffer minimal dcr because they are made within 30 minutes of the meridian , sometimes frames are taken far enough from the meridian that it is advantageous to make dcr corrections , e.g. for important targets observed in non - ideal observing seasons and in cases when the total number of available frames can be boosted by utilizing photometry frames taken in the parallax filter .",
    "different observing and reduction methods used to measure dcr have been discussed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . here",
    "we use both the theoretical methods proposed by @xcite and the empirical methodology proposed by @xcite to measure dcr for the ctiopi program , and to make final corrections during astrometric reductions .",
    "dcr calibration observations for ctiopi were made during four photometric nights in december 2002 using the 0.9-m telescope at ctio .",
    "this is the identical combination of telescope , filters , and ccd camera used during the parallax program .",
    "ten different fields spread from zenith to low altitude that contained blue ( @xmath15 ) to red ( @xmath16 ) stars were selected and observed through the @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 filters .",
    "ten fields were each observed up to five times per night through hour angles of @xmath34 hours .",
    "exposure times were chosen to be the same as used in the parallax program for each field so that the faintest reference stars could be analyzed for dcr . in total",
    ", 72 stars were included in the final dcr analysis .",
    "although refraction is , in general , a function of temperature , pressure , and humidity , due to the stable observing conditions throughout this run , these factors can be ignored , as discussed in @xcite and @xcite .    in order to provide a zero point reference frame for the dcr calculation , one set of images",
    "must be taken when the field transits .",
    "in other words , there is no refraction in the ra direction , and we assign zero refraction in the dec direction , when the hour angle is zero .",
    "the components of refraction in the ra and dec directions , @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively ( where @xmath22 is the mean refraction ) , are given by    @xmath23    where ( @xmath4 , @xmath1 ) are the coordinates without atmospheric refraction and ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) are the coordinates after atmospheric refraction .",
    "the angle @xmath26 is the latitude of the observing site , ha is the hour angle of a given star and @xmath27 is its zenith distance . as discussed in @xcite , @xmath28 merely represents the sign of the declination term , i.e.  @xmath29 if @xmath30 and @xmath31 if @xmath32 .",
    "these empirical measurements assume that @xmath22 is a polynomial function of @xmath33 color ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we have determined the @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 magnitudes for all 72 stars in the ten fields used to calculate the dcr so that each filter can be calibrated against the @xmath33 color ( thereby producing three sets of equations as shown in the next section ) .",
    "the images taken for the dcr model were reduced in a manner identical to the parallax frames , as discussed in section  [ astro.initial.steps ] .",
    "the three @xmath10 frames having the smallest hour angle were selected as trail plates assumed to have no dcr .",
    "plate constants are calculated using the gaussfit program @xcite .",
    "six plate constants are derived so that field rotation , translation , and scaling can be removed ( see section  [ astro.many.epochs ] ) .",
    "we ignore any effects of source proper motion or parallax during the four nights of dcr observations because they are negligible on that time scale .",
    "consequently , after calculating the plate constants , the only shifts in stellar centroids are because of atmospheric refraction .",
    "the amount of centroid shift from the trail plate in the x direction is a direct measure of the refraction , as represented by the quantity on the far left side of equation 1 .",
    "@xcite ( see their figure 2 ) showed that because the refraction in the y direction has been defined as shown in equation 2 ( effectively removing any shift in the y direction for zero hour angle ) , the x shift ( @xmath20 ) will have more variation than the y shift ( @xmath21 ) when the hour angle is different from zero . therefore , we concentrate on the ra direction to determine the empirical polynomial function for @xmath22 .    to determine the functional form of @xmath22 , first the hour angle and @xmath34 for every useful star in the ten dcr calibration fields are derived . then , based on the centroid shift and @xmath34 for various stars observed during the observing run , the slope of @xmath22 versus @xmath34 can be found .",
    "figure  [ fig : dcr.slope ] shows an example for lhs 158 and a reference star in the field .",
    "the field was observed from 1.47 hours east of the meridian to 3.71 hours west , including eight sets of @xmath10 observations at different hour angles",
    ". a linear fit , whose slope is @xmath22 , was made for each filter to each of the 72 stars selected in the ten fields in order to provide an ensemble of values , @xmath22 , as a function of @xmath33 color .",
    "we set the zero point for dcr to be @xmath35 when @xmath36 , thereby defining a star of that color to show no dcr , while all other stars dcr is measured relative to that .",
    "the @xmath37 order coefficient for each field is slightly different from the others because there is rarely a star with @xmath36 in a frame , but the offset can be computed by a least squares fit for a polynomial function to all stars that are present in a given field . by combining the @xmath22 slopes and the @xmath33 values for all 72 stars , we generate the plots in figure  [ fig : dcr.fit.plot ] , showing the empirical fits with solid curves .",
    "the mean empirical dcr functions for three different filters are given by :    @xmath38    the theoretical curves for all three filters were also calculated using the model from @xcite and are shown in figure  [ fig : dcr.fit.plot ] as dashed lines .",
    "a hypothetical field at dec @xmath2 @xmath3926 , `` observed '' during a night with temperature @xmath40 and @xmath41 humidity was chosen to generate the model curves .",
    "these conditions are similar to those encountered during ctiopi observations .",
    "twelve stars with spectral types of a0 v to m5 v were selected for the model , and were `` observed '' at positions that were 0 to 3 hours from the meridian .",
    "as expected , figure  [ fig : dcr.fit.plot ] shows that @xmath19 band has the least dcr of the three filters .",
    "in all three filters the average difference between the model and the empirical curve is always less than 6 mas for stars with @xmath42 3.2 . because our dcr sample is deficient in very red stars , the difference between the empirical and theoretical curves increases at the red end of the @xmath18 band calibration .",
    "note that when the stellar color is redder than @xmath43 , stars observed through the @xmath18 filter will actually experience more dcr than they will when observed through the @xmath17 filter .",
    "this result can be explained because we are discussing `` differential '' color refraction among a set of stars . at a given position in the sky ,",
    "the amount of refraction is caused primarily by two factors  how photons in a given filter bandpass are refracted by the earth s atmosphere , and how the number of photons changes within the bandpass , i.e. the slopes of the various stellar spectra .",
    "in the case of the @xmath10 filters , the @xmath18 filter has the largest amount of refraction for the reddest stars because both factors are important , whereas in the @xmath17 band the slopes of the stellar spectra do not change much for very red stars , and in the @xmath19 band , the atmosphere does not refract the photons significantly , regardless of a star s color . consequently",
    ", the dcr correction for each star can be made by obtaining its @xmath17 and @xmath19 photometry and applying equation 1 to 3 .",
    "a valuable comparison of astrometry reductions is shown in figure  [ fg : dcr.gj1061 ] , in which results from two reductions are presented for the same data  one with and one without dcr corrections . a series of high hour angle measurements were taken in mid-2003 to test our dcr protocol .",
    "the effects of dcr corrections are clearly seen when comparing these two panels . in the case of no dcr corrections ( the two plots on the left ) ,",
    "the x direction residuals show a very deep `` valley '' and the y direction residuals show a large scatter .",
    "after the dcr corrections are applied , the x residuals flatten out , and the y residuals are reduced and more symmetric around zero .",
    "the standard deviations for x and y residuals drop from 12.5 and 8.6 mas to 5.6 and 8.4 mas , respectively , when dcr corrections are made .",
    "the larger reduction in the x direction is expected because the differential refraction is more significant in the ra direction .",
    "once dcr corrections are incorporated into the data reduction pipeline , the positions of a pi star and a set of reference stars can be accurately computed for an ensemble of frames , with each frame in the ensemble being compared to the trail plate . the relationship between a frame and the trail plate",
    "is based on the measured positions of reference stars only ( not the pi star ) .",
    "a new set of coordinates for each reference star is derived as a function of the trail plate coordinates and a set of constants :    @xmath44    where @xmath45 are the original coordinates of a reference star , a",
    " f are the _ plate constants _ , and @xmath46 are the coordinates after the transformation .",
    "this six - constant model allows for a different scale in both the x and y directions , compensates for different amounts of translation in both directions , and includes a correction for any instrument rotation . the higher order plate constants  radial distortion : @xmath47 , coma : @xmath48 ( m is magnitude ) , and decentering distortion : @xmath49 @xcite ",
    "are not included in the current calculations because parallax results from our standard stars are within 2@xmath50 of all other observations and no systematic differences are seen ( discussed in section  [ pi.quality.check ] ) .",
    "analysis of the stellar path of the pi star must take into account both proper motion and parallax , but each reference star also experiences both motions on the sky . because accurate proper motions and parallaxes are rarely known for reference stars , we assume that the reference grid has @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the set of constants for each frame outlined in equation 4 above is expanded to include the reference star motions , resulting in an expanded set of equations :    @xmath53    where superscripts indicate frame numbers , subscripts indicate the identification numbers of reference stars , the product @xmath54@xmath55 is the star s total proper motion relative to the date of the trail plate , the product @xmath56@xmath57 is the parallax offset from the date of the trail plate ( @xmath58 is the parallax factor in ra ) , and @xmath59 represents the x coordinate for the trail plate .",
    "the plate constants , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 can be calculated from these equations using least squares methods which are constrained by the conditions of reference star parallaxes and proper motions summing to zero .",
    "a similar set of equations is obtained for the y coordinate ( plate constants @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 in equation 4 ) . after the plate constants and reference star values for @xmath54 and @xmath56 are acquired , @xmath54 and @xmath56 ( and their errors )",
    "are computed for the pi star .",
    "the least squares calculation is run using gaussfit ( discussed in section 4.3 ) , which typically requires three iterations to minimize @xmath66@xmath67 .",
    "the image quality of each frame and the reliability of reference stars are determined using the results of the initial run of gaussfit . at this stage ,",
    "reference stars with high proper motion , large parallax , large centroid residuals , or high photometric parallax are deleted .",
    "entire frames with high residuals are also removed .",
    "the gaussfit program is then run again to derive the final pi star @xmath54 and @xmath56 values .",
    "what we have measured reflects the parallax of the pi star relative to the set of reference stars is the relative trigonometric parallax , @xmath56 . as discussed in @xcite and @xcite , there are ( at least ) three different ways to convert this _ relative parallax _ to the  _ absolute parallax _ , which is a measure of the true distance to the pi star  using statistical methods , spectroscopic parallaxes , or photometric parallaxes for the reference stars .",
    "statistical methods rely on a model of the galaxy for the disk and halo . by adopting a galactic model and knowing the apparent magnitudes and galactic coordinates of the reference stars , parallaxes can be estimated for the reference stars .",
    "no reference star color information is used .",
    "for example , @xcite concludes that faint halo stars have ( @xmath68 ) with a narrow distribution in their parallaxes for fields near the north galactic pole .",
    "however , bright disk stars ( @xmath69 ) exhibit a wide range of parallaxes .",
    "therefore , faint reference stars have smaller mean parallaxes and require a small correction for the relative to absolute parallax conversion , while brighter reference stars require larger corrections . as discussed in section  [ astro.initial.steps ] ,",
    "the reference stars chosen for ctiopi are the brightest available in the pi star fields ( in order to obtain better centroids ) , so we do not use a statistical methodology for the conversion of relative to absolute parallax .    using spectroscopic parallaxes is arguably the most reliable method to determine the correction from relative to absolute parallax because the spectral type and luminosity class of every reference star are determined .",
    "this allows us to distinguish main sequence stars from giants and subdwarfs , and to apply correct @xmath70 relations for each class of star .",
    "however , this method requires a significant amount of observing time , and is not practical for ctiopi , in which several hundred stars with @xmath510 reference stars each are observed .",
    "instead , we use the photometric parallax method to convert the pi star s relative parallax to its absolute parallax . @xmath10 magnitudes for the pi star and all reference stars have already been acquired for the dcr corrections , so the same data can be used to estimate a parallax of each reference star . however , because of the lack of information about the luminosity class of these stars , these corrections assume that all of the reference stars are main - sequence stars .",
    "additional corrections for the contamination by giants or galactic reddening have not been included because such corrections are anticipated to be much smaller than the typical errors on the final parallaxes .",
    "the fundamental relations between @xmath71 and color used in ctiopi are based on the sample of stars within 10 pc ( henry et al .",
    "1997 , 2004 ) .",
    "close multiple stars , subdwarfs , evolved stars , and stars with poor trigonometric parallaxes have been deleted from this sample to provide reliable @xmath70 relations .",
    "three different colors , @xmath72 , @xmath33 , and @xmath73 , are used to calculate the mean photometric parallax for each reference star .",
    "the error on the photometric parallax for an individual star is taken to be the average difference between the mean photometric parallax and the parallax from each color .",
    "the weighted mean photometric parallax of the entire set of reference stars is then calculated , and represents the final correction from relative to absolute parallax .",
    "the error in the final correction is determined from    @xmath74    where @xmath75 is the number of reference stars , @xmath76 is the photometric parallax error of each star and @xmath77 is the weighted mean photometric parallax of the ensemble of reference stars .",
    "we note that the mean absolute parallax correction for all 36 motion stars in table  [ tbl : pi.result ] is 1.47 @xmath3 0.17 mas .",
    "the same _ redpi _ package discussed in section  [ astro.initial.steps ] is used to process the raw photometry data .",
    "stars of interest , including pi stars , reference stars , and photometric standard stars , are tagged and enclosed in an aperture with a 7  radius if there are no nearby background stars that might contaminate the photometry .",
    "a 7  radius aperture was used for the standard stars in order to match the aperture typically used by @xcite . after removing cosmic rays ,",
    "the instrumental magnitude is determined by summing all of the counts for pixels falling in the aperture . in the few cases where a contaminating source is within the 7  aperture ,",
    "an aperture correction is performed . a sky annulus with 20  inner radius and 3  width",
    "was applied to calculate the sky background counts .",
    "the transformation equation for apparent magnitude is    @xmath78    where @xmath79 is the instrumental magnitude from _",
    "iraf / daophot _ , @xmath80 through @xmath81 are the transformation coefficients , @xmath82 is the color term ( which may have various permutations using @xmath10 magnitudes ) , @xmath83 is the airmass and @xmath84 is the standard magnitude from @xcite .",
    "the _ iraf / fitparam _ task is used to compute these coefficients via a least squares method . to generate the final @xmath10 magnitudes on the johnson - kron - cousins system",
    ", the transformation equation is applied using a custom - made perl task . the advantage of this perl script over the _ iraf / evalfit _ task is that the output file contains not only the @xmath10 apparent magnitudes , but image names , magnitude errors , and the date of data reduction .",
    "these output files are then concatenated into a large master photometry database for future access .",
    "seven parallax standard stars were selected to check the reliability of ctiopi results .",
    "they were selected so that different parts of the sky were represented .",
    "all but one , lhs 1777 , are within 10 pc and have final parallax determinations with more than 60 frames spanning more than 2.5 years .",
    "the trigonometric parallax results for these stars from ctiopi and other sources are shown in table  [ tb : parallax.standard ] and figure  [ fg : parallax.standard.plot ] .",
    "note that all of the measured ctiopi parallaxes are within @xmath85 of all other observations , indicating that the current parallax pipeline , dcr corrections , and conversion from relative to absolute parallax produce reliable results .",
    "the final parallax error is a combination of many factors , including ( 1 ) the accuracy of the coordinates , ( 2 ) the quality of the reference star frame ( brightness , distribution ) , ( 3 ) the accuracy of the ( x , y ) centroids , including any ellipticity caused by any close component ( 4 ) the total number of parallax images , ( 5 ) the time span of the available frame series , ( 6 ) the parallax factor coverage , ( 7 ) the dcr corrections , and ( 8) the correction of relative to final absolute parallax .",
    "the first three factors can not easily be modified after they are chosen .",
    "however , the number of observations , the duration of the frames series , and the parallax factor coverage , can be controlled and depend only on the resources , staffing , and stamina of the ctiopi team . at present , a pi star is generally considered `` finished '' when all of the following criteria are met :    1 .",
    "the relative parallax error is less than 3 mas 2 .",
    "the pi star has been observed for 4 or more seasons ( one season includes 2 - 3 months of observations ) 3 .",
    "the pi star has been observed for at least 2.5 years 4 .",
    "there are at least 40 frames of the field 5 .",

    "figure  [ fg : pi.time.line ] illustrates how time coverage affects the relative parallax error for 10 different stars within 10 pc ( six are calibration stars and four are additional ctiopi targets ) .",
    "parallax reductions were executed using various subsets of the complete data sets ( each star indicated with a different symbol ) .",
    "a few stars show only @xmath52 mas error after only about one year of observations . in these cases , the parallaxes determined can be quite inaccurate , but a good fit with minimal formal error can be made to the proper motion and parallactic motion even though they have not yet been adequately decoupled . when key high parallax factor images are taken later , a different stellar path is determined and the error represents reality .",
    "the mean error for all of the reductions for all 10 fields is 2.45 mas .",
    "this error is reached at a time point 2.32 years into an observing sequence .",
    "we therefore conclude that @xmath52.5 years of coverage is sufficient to determine accurate parallaxes with acceptable final errors based on the current time baseline we have .",

    "binary systems provide several opportunities to glean additional insight into stellar properties because the components are assumed to have formed simultaneously ( so have the same age ) , and from the same gas cloud ( so have identical composition ) .",

    "the two new wide sdk / m+ wd pairs reported here have complete parallax and @xmath10 photometry . in both cases ,",
    "figure  [ fg : color.mag.2 ] clearly indicates that the primary star is a subdwarf and that the secondary is a white dwarf .",
    "however , both white dwarfs are redder than all white dwarfs with @xmath33 and parallax reported in blr .",
    "the locations of lhs 193b and lhs 300b in the hr diagram can possibly be explained several ways , including multiplicity , composition , very low mass ( and hence large size ) , and/or dust .",
    "in particular , models by @xcite indicate that very low mass helium white dwarfs may have the colors observed .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite argue that as the @xmath102 decreases to 3000 k for old ( @xmath103 11 gyr ) white dwarfs with hydrogen atmospheres , their location in the hr diagram swings back @xmath104 of the white dwarf cooling sequence .",
    "this is caused by strong h@xmath105 molecular absorption features expanding into the optical regions .",
    "this implies that both lhs 193b and lhs 300b , which lie outside the grid for typical hydrogen white dwarfs , may be helium white dwarfs ( or hydrogen white dwarfs with lower surface gravity values than have been included in the model grid  unlikely , because of the observed distribution of surface gravities for hydrogen white dwarfs ) .",
