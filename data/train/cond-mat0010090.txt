    "the dynamics of systems of interacting ferromagnetic nanoparticles has been the focus of extensive research in recent years .",
    "a question of considerable controversy has been the existence of a phase transition to a low - temperature spin - glass - like phase @xcite .",
    "recent studies on strongly interacting systems have reported a critical slowing down @xcite and a critical divergence of the non - linear susceptibility @xcite .",
    "in addition , non - equilibrium properties such as ageing , memory and rejuvenation phenomena have been observed in magnetic relaxation and low frequency ac susceptibility measurements at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "these observations indicate the existence of a low - temperature spin - glass - like state . however , some questions about the collective state of interacting nanoparticles are still not resolved . in a recent experimental study of an interacting maghemite nanoparticle system @xcite",
    ", it was not possible to find evidence of a finite temperature transition to a spin - glass - like phase .",
    "still , the particle system exhibited non - equilibrium dynamics in magnetic relaxation experiments , typical of spin glasses .",
    "the absence of a critical behaviour was in this study linked to mixing of collective and single particle relaxation effects .",
    "mixing of this kind can for instance originate from a broad particle size distribution , or it may be observed in a system with a small volume fraction of particles and therefore comparably weak inter - particle interactions .    in this work ,",
    "extensive studies of the magnetic dynamics in a close to monodisperse nanoparticle system are presented .",
    "three samples having different volume concentrations of nanoparticles were investigated ; one dilute and nominally non - interacting sample and two more concentrated interacting samples . both interacting samples exhibit",
    "collective behaviour due to dipolar interactions at low temperatures , but only the most interacting sample displays critical dynamics in the investigated time window and shows equilibrium dynamics quite similar to that of an atomic spin glass .",
    "the particles were prepared by thermal decomposition of fe(co)@xmath0 ( 20.0 ml ) in a mixture of carrier liquid ( 50.0 ml cis - trans decalin ) and surfactant ( 4.0 g oleic acid ) by the method described in @xcite .",
    "this method leads to the formation of surfactant coated particles of the amorphous alloy fe@xmath1c@xmath2 ( x @xmath3 0.2 - 0.3 ) .",
    "the decomposition was carried out slowly by using low heating powers .",
    "great care was taken at all times to avoid oxidation of the particles and a flow of ar / h@xmath4 ( 98/2% ) gas through the reaction vessel was maintained throughout the preparation .",
    "after preparation , the decalin carrier liquid was evaporated at 140 @xmath5c under reduced pressure using a gas flow to drive out the vapour and a small amount of de - gassed xylene was added such that the volume fraction of particles in the resulting base ferrofluid was about 5 vol% .",
    "more dilute samples were obtained by further dilution of this ferrofluid by addition of xylene and more concentrated samples were obtained by evaporating the xylene at room temperature in vacuum . all sample handling after the preparation of the base ferrofluid",
    "was carried out in an argon glove box .",
    "the chemical state of the iron in the ferrofluids was checked by mssbauer spectroscopy , which showed that no significant oxidation of the particles had taken place during the sample preparation and sample handling .",
    "the particle volume fractions in the resulting samples were estimated from the iron content determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy .",
    "the sizes of the particles were determined from transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) studies .",
    "a droplet of a dilute ferrofluid was placed onto a grid , that was left in air for about a week to ensure full oxidation of the particles . the size determination from the resulting tem micrographs",
    "was subsequently corrected for the change in density due to the oxidation of the particles .",
    "the shape of the particles was spherical to a good approximation .",
    "the particle size distribution was obtained using the computer analysis method described in @xcite .",
    "the analysis of 1579 particles yielded the average particle diameter @xmath6 nm with the standard deviation 0.3 nm .",
    "the volume - weighted volume distribution was well described by the lognormal distribution , @xmath7dv$ ] , with @xmath8 nm@xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the saturation magnetisation was estimated to @xmath11 am@xmath12 from langevin fits to magnetisation vs. field curves at several temperatures well above the superparamagnetic blocking temperature .",
    "the present preparation batch is slightly different from that studied previously in @xcite .",
    "we have studied three samples with particle concentrations of @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15  vol% . in the most concentrated sample ,",
    "most of the carrier liquid was evaporated and the sample had a paste - like consistency .",
    "this resulted in poor thermal contact between the sample and the sample container .",
    "thermal stability was not achieved until several minutes after a change in temperature , preventing systematic studies of the non - equilibrium dynamics for this sample .",
    "two experimental set - ups were used for the magnetic studies . a commercial susceptometer ( lakeshore model 7225 )",
    "was used for dc field scans and ac susceptibility measurements in a frequency range of 15 - 1000 hz . a non - commercial superconducting quantum interference device (",
    "squid ) magnetometer @xcite was used for ac susceptibility measurements in a frequency range of 10 mhz - 9.1 khz , zero field cooled ( zfc ) relaxation measurements and magnetic noise measurements .",
    "the applied ac and dc fields were chosen small enough ( 0.1 oe ) to ensure linear response from the samples .",
    "the background field was less than 1 moe .",
    "the zfc relaxation measurements were carried out by cooling the sample to the measuring temperature @xmath16 in zero field , equilibrating the system for a wait time @xmath17 , and then applying a small dc field @xmath18 and measuring the magnetisation @xmath19 as a function of time , @xmath20 , after that the field was applied . for a slowly relaxing system , it can be shown that @xmath19 and the relaxation rate @xmath21 relate to the real and imaginary components of the ac susceptibility as @xcite @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "magnetic noise measurements were performed in zero external field using an hp35670a dynamic signal analyser .",
    "the power spectrum of the magnetic fluctuations was measured in three overlapping frequency intervals ( i ) 0.003 - 12.5 hz , ( ii ) 0.25 - 400 hz and ( iii ) 8 - 12500 hz .",
    "the background spectra were subtracted from the data .",
    "data of the same order of magnitude as the background signal were not used in the analysis .",
    "the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite relates the noise power spectrum to the zero - field limit of the out - of - phase ac susceptibility as @xmath24 a comparison between the out - of - phase component obtained from ac susceptibility measurements and results obtained from zero field noise measurements verifies that equation ( [ eq_noise ] ) is obeyed and hence that the ac data are obtained in the linear response regime .",
    "figure [ fig_x3_ac ] shows the ac susceptibility measured in the commercial set - up for the three samples .",
    "the most dilute sample with a 0.06  vol% fraction of particles is intended to serve as an experimental reference for a non - interacting system . however , the peak height of @xmath25 for this sample increases slightly with increasing frequency .",
    "this trend is opposite to the expected behaviour for non - interacting nanoparticles @xcite and thus indicates that the dynamics of this sample is influenced by weak inter - particle interactions . despite this",
    ", it is possible to assess the distribution of energy barriers with reasonable accuracy making use of the method described in @xcite .",
    "this analysis yields @xmath26 s and @xmath27 jm@xmath28 .",
    "the extracted values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 compare reasonably well with previous estimates . for 5.0 nm fe - c particles ,",
    "@xmath29 has been estimated to @xmath31 jm@xmath28 , and it has been found that @xmath29 increases with decreasing particle size to @xmath32 jm@xmath28 for 3.2 nm particles @xcite .",
    "studies of different preparation batches have reported values of @xmath30 in the range @xmath33 s to @xmath34 s @xcite .",
    "figures [ fig_x1_ac ] and [ fig_dry_ac ] show the ac susceptibility data measured in the non - commercial squid for the 5 and 17  vol% samples , respectively .",
    "for the 5  vol% sample , zfc relaxation data are also included .",
    "a few differences in the behaviour of these samples as compared to the dilute sample can immediately be noticed .",
    "the peak height of @xmath35 increases significantly with increasing frequency , and the width of the peak increases with increasing frequency .",
    "the onset of a non - zero @xmath25 , is shifted towards higher temperatures and it becomes sharper with increasing volume fraction of particles .",
    "figure [ fig_x1_age ] shows the relaxation rate for the 5  vol% sample measured for two different wait times at different temperatures . below 40 k ,",
    "a clear wait time dependence is observed indicating that non - equilibrium phenomena plays a key role for the dynamics at low temperatures .",
    "the same sample has recently been subject to a detailed study of the low temperature non - equilibrium dynamics in which the memory effect in the ac susceptibility was observed and further characterised by temperature cycling zfc relaxation experiments @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the non - equilibrium dynamics in this sample is governed by long - range collective behaviour and that well - known concepts for spin glasses such as chaos with temperature and overlap length are necessary to describe the observations .",
    "this implies that the magnetic relaxation of the two concentrated samples must be analysed in terms of collective dynamics .",
    "a model for weakly interacting particles , such as that proposed in @xcite , where the effect of dipolar interaction on the relaxation time is accounted for by introducing the thermodynamic averages of the local dipolar field in a rigorous expression for the single particle relaxation time , is only valid at temperatures much higher than the freezing temperatures of the two concentrated samples .",
    "below , we briefly introduce the concepts of dynamic scaling and discuss the observed dynamics for the two concentrated samples in terms of critical dynamics .",
    "a signature of a continuous magnetic phase transition is the divergence of the correlation length , @xmath36 , when the phase transition temperature , @xmath37 , is approached from above as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the average distance between interacting moments , @xmath40 is the reduced temperature and @xmath41 is a critical exponent . according to conventional critical slowing down , the longest relaxation time due to correlated dynamics , @xmath42 ,",
    "is related to the correlation length as @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the dynamic critical exponent .",
    "hence , for @xmath45 @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a microscopic relaxation time . according to the dynamic scaling hypothesis @xcite , for @xmath45 and @xmath48 , the spin auto - correlation function can be written in the scaling form @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a critical exponent and @xmath51 is a scaling function .",
    "using linear response theory it is possible from this relation to obtain the complex susceptibility and derive the scaling relation @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 is a scaling function .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour is @xmath55 , with @xmath56 and @xmath57 for small and large values of @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "using the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath54 in the limit @xmath59 , the following relation holds @xcite @xmath60 implying that the left hand side of equation ( [ eq_ad ] ) at each temperature reaches a frequency independent plateau .",
    "the meaning of @xmath47 is that it is the relaxation time of the individual magnetic entities in the system . for spin glasses , @xmath61 s and",
    "is the fluctuation time of an atomic moment . for nanoparticles",
    ", @xmath47 can be assigned to the superparamagnetic relaxation time of a single particle of average size . in a dense system , the dipolar interaction may modify this relaxation time compared that of isolated particles .",
    "however , as a first approximation , it is reasonable to assume that @xmath47 is close to the superparamagnetic relaxation time of an isolated particle , which in the relevant temperature range for our studies can be approximated by the arrhenius - nel expression .",
    "below , we compare two approximations : i ) @xmath62 constant , and",
    "ii ) @xmath63 .",
    "the first approximation has been used in previous work @xcite , but it is only a good approximation if there is little variation of the single particle relaxation time in the temperature interval used for the analysis .    in ac susceptibility experiments , the slowing down of the relaxation time @xmath42 ( equation ( [ eq_ds ] )",
    "can be derived from the temperatures where an onset of dissipation occurs ( freezing temperatures ) as a function of the observation time @xmath64 .",
    "we have considered two criteria for the onset . in the first criterion ,",
    "the freezing temperature is defined as the temperature at which @xmath65 attains 15% of its maximum value . in the second criterion",
    ", the freezing temperature is defined from the relation @xmath66 .",
    "figure [ fig_ds](b ) shows the freezing temperatures for the two concentrated samples obtained from @xmath67 data .",
    "the superparamagnetic blocking temperatures estimated from the peaks of the @xmath25 data for the dilute sample are included for comparison .",
    "first , we consider the approximation @xmath62 constant .",
    "using the out - of - phase susceptibility data , a dynamic scaling analysis according to equation ( [ eq_ds ] ) results in @xmath68 k , @xmath69 and @xmath70 s @xcite .",
    "this analysis is performed for reduced temperatures in the range @xmath71 and corresponds to 4 decades of observation times . a similar analysis using the in - phase susceptibility data results in @xmath72  k , @xmath73 and @xmath74 s. the values of @xmath37 and @xmath75 from the two analyses are in good agreement , and the value of @xmath47 is , considering the temperature interval used in the analysis and the estimates of @xmath30 and @xmath29 given above , within the limits implied by the arrhenius - nel expression .",
    "the derived values of @xmath75 also compare well to values found in previous work on nanoparticles : @xmath76 in @xcite and @xmath77 in @xcite , but less well to @xmath78 found in reference @xcite .",
    "a good agreement is also found comparing with canonical 3d ising and heisenberg spin glasses , for which @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "an analysis according to the full scaling relation , equation ( [ eq_fd ] ) , using @xmath80 and @xmath81 yields data collapse for @xmath82 ( see reference @xcite , figure 3 ) . this analysis is based on all available @xmath25 data with temperatures corresponding to @xmath83 ( @xmath84 k ) .",
    "the value of @xmath50 is in good agreement with @xmath85 obtained from a full scaling analysis of the non - linear magnetic susceptibility on a similar sample @xcite , but larger than typical values of @xmath86 reported for 3d ising and heisenberg spin glasses @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath87 , extracted from the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath54 for large @xmath58 , is consistent with the derived values of @xmath50 and @xmath75 .",
    "next , we consider the effect of using @xmath88 .",
    "it should be noted that this introduces one extra parameters that can be varied in the analysis , and we have therefore explored the critical behaviour for a variety of choices of @xmath30 and @xmath89 to evaluate the robustness of the estimates of @xmath75 and @xmath50 .",
    "critical slowing down analyses have been performed for various fixed values of @xmath30 and @xmath37 and the values of @xmath75 and @xmath89 have been estimated and used in the analysis according to the scaling relation , equation ( [ eq_fd ] ) , to extract the value of @xmath50 . from these analyses , it is found that both the critical slowing down analysis and the full scaling relation can be fulfilled for @xmath90 k with @xmath91 .",
    "the estimate of @xmath92 depends slightly on whether the @xmath67 or the @xmath25 data are used in the critical slowing down analysis , and the corresponding parameter intervals are @xmath93 k using @xmath67 ( shown in figure [ fig_ds ] ) and @xmath94 k using @xmath25 . for both analyses ,",
    "the extracted critical exponents attain the values @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "other values of @xmath30 of the order of @xmath97 s yield slightly different values of @xmath98 but the same values of the critical exponents .",
    "the values of @xmath92 and @xmath30 are of the same size as the estimates for the dilute sample , @xmath99 k and @xmath100 s , but it is stressed that an exact correspondence is not expected .",
    "the values of @xmath75 and @xmath50 are slightly smaller than those obtained from the analysis assuming a constant @xmath47 .",
    "the decrease of @xmath75 is due to the fact that the temperature dependence of @xmath101 is weaker when @xmath47 is allowed to vary with temperature .",
    "the reduced value of @xmath75 and the extracted smaller value of @xmath50 leads to @xmath102 , which is the same value as found from the analysis using a constant value of @xmath47 .",
    "the data collapse of @xmath103 vs. @xmath104 to a single function @xmath54 according to equations ( [ eq_ds ] ) and ( [ eq_fd ] ) using @xmath105 s and @xmath106 k ( the average of the values obtained using @xmath67 and @xmath25 in the critical slowing down analyses ) is shown in figure [ fig_dry_fd ] .",
    "the scaling is of the same quality as that assuming a constant @xmath47 , and the asymptotic behaviours are the same ( in agreement with the estimates of @xmath50 and @xmath75 ) .    figure [ fig_ad](b ) shows @xmath107 as a function of @xmath108 for different temperatures @xmath109 in a log - log plot for the 17  vol% sample .",
    "the prediction of plateaus at low frequencies from equation ( [ eq_ad ] ) holds regardless of a temperature dependence of @xmath47 and figure [ fig_ad](b ) shows that the prediction is well confirmed for this sample . in the same figure , the behaviour calculated from equation ( [ eq_fd ] )",
    "is also included using the experimentally determined scaling function , @xmath54 , and extrapolating using its asymptotic behaviour .",
    "for the 5  vol% sample , an apparent scaling according to equation ( [ eq_ds ] ) with a constant value of @xmath47 can be obtained for temperatures corresponding to @xmath110 ( 6 decades of observation times ) with @xmath111 k , @xmath112 and @xmath113 s using @xmath25 data , and with @xmath114  k , @xmath115 and @xmath116 s using @xmath67 and zfc relaxation data ( shown in figure [ fig_ds ] ) .",
    "however , deviations from scaling are found at lower temperatures ( @xmath117 ) . moreover ,",
    "it is not possible to obtain data collapse according to the full scaling relation equation ( [ eq_fd ] ) , with temperatures corresponding to @xmath118 ( or to @xmath119 ) , for any choice of @xmath37 , @xmath75 and @xmath50 . based on the estimates of @xmath120 and @xmath30 for the dilute sample and the temperature range used in the analysis above",
    ", it is expected that @xmath121 s. however , the derived value ( @xmath122 ) deviate by orders of magnitude from this range .",
    "furthermore , even introducing an arrhenius - nel temperature dependence of @xmath47 , it is not possible to obtain unambiguous parameters from the critical slowing down analysis and to fulfil scaling according to equation ( [ eq_fd ] ) .",
    "a simple manifestation of critical dynamics , which is independent of a temperature dependence of @xmath47 , is that @xmath107 should settle on plateaus for small values of @xmath108 .",
    "conferring figure [ fig_ad](a ) , it is seen that this prediction is not fulfilled for the 5 vol% sample ( except for @xmath123 k ) , and this is a further indication of non - critical dynamics in this sample .",
    "several factors may contribute to deviations from critical behaviour and a possible non - divergence of the correlation length .",
    "first , there may be physical clustering of the particles ( _ i.e. _ , regions with a higher density of particles than average ) .",
    "the effect of clustering is two - fold : at comparably high temperatures , where short - range correlations are relevant , the stronger inter - particle interaction in particle clusters will enhance the local correlation length and shift the dynamics to longer time scales than expected from the volume fraction of particles and a homogeneous particle dispersion .",
    "in addition , the small scale heterogeneity will create a dispersion of length scales for the collective dynamics that modifies and possibly limits the growth of correlations at lower temperatures .",
    "second , the polydispersivity of the particle system leads to a distribution of single particle relaxation times with a width that increases significantly with decreasing temperature ( and is thus more important for the 5 vol% sample than for the 17 vol% sample ) . at lower temperatures ,",
    "the largest particles may therefore become thermally blocked on time scales comparable to the longest time scale related to the collective dynamics and act as random magnets instead of taking part in the collective dynamics .",
    "this may completely mask or even obstruct long - range collective behaviour , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the non - critical behaviour of the present 5 vol% sample is most likely both due to the formation of clusters of particles ( see section below ) and the dispersion of single particle relaxation times .      for a spin glass and @xmath124 , @xmath125 is history dependent and has a non - trivial variation with @xmath20 .",
    "however , when quasi - equilibrium is probed , one can write @xmath126 , where @xmath127 attains a positive value close to zero @xcite . for @xmath128 , the time dependence of @xmath125",
    "is determined by the critical dynamics .",
    "as discussed previously , the critical dynamics result in fluctuations spanning all time scales between @xmath47 and @xmath42 , and this gives a very broad spectrum of relaxation times . from equation ( [ s ] ) and using the asymptotic behaviours of @xmath54 in equation ( [ eq_fd ] ) , it is easily seen that @xmath129 with @xmath130 for @xmath131 and @xmath132 for @xmath133 @xcite . at intermediate observation times , @xmath127 monotonically increases with @xmath20 between the two extremes and a cross - over ( or knee ) from an essentially flat @xmath125 vs. @xmath20 curve to @xmath134 is expected at @xmath135 .",
    "figure [ fig_com_s ] shows the relaxation rate vs time for the three samples at different temperatures in the range @xmath136  k @xmath137 @xmath138  k. for the 0.06 and 17  vol% samples @xmath25 data are shown , and for the 5  vol% sample results from zfc relaxation , ac susceptibility and magnetic noise measurements are included .",
    "for the 17  vol% sample , @xmath25 data for @xmath109 obtained from equation ( [ eq_fd ] ) using the experimentally estimated @xmath54 and the expected asymptotic behaviour for small @xmath58 are also shown . in the low - temperature region ,",
    "@xmath139 k , the magnitudes of the relaxation rates for the two interacting samples are much smaller than that for the 0.06  vol% sample .",
    "this is a signature of collective dynamics @xcite .",
    "moreover , the relaxation rate of the 17  vol% sample is smaller than that of the 5  vol% sample . for temperatures @xmath140  k and in the investigated time window",
    ", the relaxation rate of the 0.06  vol% sample decays with increasing observation time , while the relaxation rate of the the 5  vol% sample at short time scales exhibits a weak frequency dependence followed by a knee and a decrease towards zero at longer time scales .",
    "this approach towards zero relaxation rate ( @xmath141 between 45 and 55 k ) is slower than that of an atomic spin glass ( for which @xmath142 ) and consistent with the lack of plateaus in the @xmath107 curves for the corresponding temperatures in figure [ fig_ad](a ) .",
    "the time dependence of the relaxation rate at time scales shorter than this knee is also uncharacteristic of a spin glass as it is non - monotonic in time and shows a broad maximum .",
    "for the 17  vol% sample and in the temperature range @xmath143  k @xmath144  k , the relaxation rate exhibits a slow , monotonous decrease with increasing observation time .",
    "the relaxation rate follows a @xmath145 dependence , with @xmath127 decreasing with decreasing temperature , mimicking the expected behaviour of a spin glass system @xcite .",
    "it should be noted though , that the particle size distribution will cause a temperature dependent and broad onset of the response on short observation times , as can be envisaged by the relaxation rate curves at the lowest temperatures . at temperatures above @xmath37 ,",
    "@xmath84 k , a knee appears in the relaxation rate also for this sample and the approach towards zero follows a @xmath146 . at temperatures",
    "@xmath123 k , the cut - off in the relaxation rate is equally sharp for both interacting samples , and the dynamics of the two samples are rather similar .",
    "this indicates , for the 5 vol% sample , that the particle moments participating in the dynamics on long time scales in this temperature range are more strongly interacting than average , _",
    "i.e. _ that these particles are part of agglomerates showing properties similar to those of the 17 vol% sample .",
    "extensive studies of the magnetic dynamics of a nanoparticle system containing nearly monodisperse ferromagnetic particles have been presented .",
    "we have shown that a strongly interacting particle system ( the 17  vol% sample ) displays critical dynamics reminiscent of that of a spin glass .",
    "furthermore , the effect of an arrhenius - nel temperature dependence of @xmath47 has been explored and it has been found that dynamic scaling for this sample prevails although with slightly reduced values of the critical exponents @xmath75 and @xmath50 .    for weakly interacting particle systems , the dipolar interaction will only slightly modify the relaxation compared to a non - interacting system , and the relaxation time can be obtained by introducing thermodynamical averages of the dipolar field in an expression for the single - particle relaxation time , as suggested in @xcite .",
    "such a theory will apply for the most dilute sample studied here ( 0.06  vol% sample ) near the blocking temperature .    for a wide range of particle concentrations ( interaction strengths ) , neither a pure model for weakly interacting systems nor a model only assuming critical dynamics will correctly describe the magnetic relaxation of an interacting particle system . in the present work , this has been illustrated by the 5  vol% sample , in which correlations and collective behavior are of importance , as evidenced by non - equilibrium dynamics similar to that exhibited by spin glasses @xcite and an apparent critical slowing down in a limited temperature range .",
    "yet , the deviation from critical slowing down at lower temperatures and the failure to satisfy other signatures of critical dynamics show that the slowing down of the magnetic dynamics in this sample differs profoundly from that in spin glasses .",
    "the range of concentrations for which such a complex behaviour occurs becomes wider with increasing width of the particle size distribution , as can be evidenced by comparing to the system studied in @xcite .",
    "for the sample used in that study , the relative dipole interaction strength ( @xmath147 , where @xmath148 is the volume fraction of particles ) is comparable to that of the 17 vol% sample studied here , but that sample has a much wider energy barrier distribution and does not exhibit critical dynamics although it shows collective behaviour .",

    "<S> effects of dipole - dipole interactions on the magnetic relaxation have been investigated for three fe - c nanoparticle samples with volume concentrations of 0.06 , 5 and 17  vol% . while both the 5 and 17  vol% samples exhibit collective behavior due to dipolar interactions , only the 17  vol% sample displays critical behavior close to its transition temperature . the behaviour of the 5  vol% sample can be attributed to a mixture of collective and single particle dynamics . </S>"
