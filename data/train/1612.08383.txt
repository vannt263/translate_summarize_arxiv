    "<S> [ [ section-2 ] ]    the transverse curvature induced by the deformation of the elastic upper boundary means that the propagation of a flat interface spanning the width of the channel is never observed . instead , the inflation of the membrane couples with the oil flow at the propagation front to select the shape of an air finger depending on @xmath13 and the initial cross - sectional shape of the channel set prior to experimentation . </S>",

    "<S> [ [ section-5 ] ]    changes to the height and width of the block , as well as to the level of initial collapse can be applied to modify the depth gradients in the channel , and thus generate a wide variety of fingering patterns . </S>",

    "<S> axial and transverse depth gradients can also couple to amplify the axial fingers at the edge of the occlusion , creating the dendritic - like pattern illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : set - up](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the amplification of the fingers generated at the edge of the occlusion leads to approximate proportionate growth ( fixed aspect ratio ) of the dendritic pattern , a feature which has been observed in other viscous fingering experiments  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the growth of dendrites has been triggered in rigid hele - shaw cells by locally perturbing the interface at the finger tip  @xcite , but the selection of the pattern is unexplained : the well - controlled geometry of the compliant channel could enable a more systematic investigation .    </S>",

    "<S> this behavior is the main source of uncertainty in our quantitative measurements . for low ca , large @xmath42 or thick membranes , </S>",
    "<S> the front becomes increasingly curved , patterns become less regular and large amplitude tip - splitting occurs : the rear meniscus and front tip of the fingers no longer travel at the same speed , so that their length increases as they propagate . </S>",

    "<S> the measured finger width scales as @xmath50 , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : geom_of_ca](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> this scaling is consistent with the linear stability analysis for a flat interface propagating in a rigid rectangular channel , which predicts that the most unstable wavelength is proportional to @xmath51  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the average finger width is essentially set by the fluid mechanical instability . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , @xmath44 remains proportional to @xmath42 in the saturated regime , indicating that the scaling at onset still holds in the saturated regime . </S>",
    "<S> a linear dependence of the wavelength on the layer depth is also present in instabilities affecting thin layers of soft solids  @xcite , but we believe our results to be among the first to demonstrate this property in flowing viscous layers . by increasing the membrane thickness ( and the transverse pre - tension ) we increase @xmath12 , which reduces the peeling angle ( presented in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : length ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> larger values of the peeling angles @xmath14 have been shown to have a stabilizing effect on the interface , enhancing the contribution of restoring capillary forces and reducing that of destabilizing viscous forces , hence delaying the onset of fingering  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we never observed the total suppression of the instability using latex membranes in our compliant channel , because the critical ca needed to propagate the uniform peeling mode is larger than that at the onset of finite - depth fingering . </S>",
    "<S> however , peeling of the thin silicone membrane occurred at larger values of @xmath14 for a given @xmath13 and stabilized a uniformly flat interface . by consistently varying the peeling angle , </S>",
    "<S> we show that @xmath14 also has an effect on the fingering pattern : it does not affect the wavelength of the pattern , as shown by the collapse of all data in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : geom_of_h](a ) , but steeper peeling fronts are more stable in a sense that they grow shorter fingers , while shallower peeling angles promote the growth of long fingers .    </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : geom_of_ca](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the length of the fingers is approximately proportional to @xmath52 , which indicates that they extend to a critical reopening height , which is around 1  mm in this case . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that this critical height depends on the volume of fluid available to form oil walls between the fingers , consistently with fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : geom_of_h](b ) , where the length of the fingers increases the liquid layer thickness @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> this first quantification of the effect of the peeling angle on the pattern generated by viscous fingering opens up perspectives for controlled pattern formation : for a given @xmath42 , the width of the pattern is set by the thickness of the liquid layer , while the length is selected by the peeling angle . from a fundamental point of view , spanning across a range of peeling angles allows us to explore the evolution of the fingering pattern as the channel transitions from compliant ( steep peeling front ) to rigid ( limit of @xmath53 ) boundaries . in the rigid limit , channel expansion no longer restrains the axial extension of the fingers . </S>",
    "<S> the divergence of the finger length as @xmath14 tends to 0 is a first step towards recovering the classical saffman - taylor finger , which grows infinitely long in a rigid uniform channel . </S>",
    "<S> although we could not observe such behavior , we would expect the constant - depth fingers to interact as they lengthen , as observed in viscous peeling experiments  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the study of elastic fingering allows us to make a connection between two classical viscous fingering problems , and in the light of the present results we conjecture that the printer s instability gives way to the classical saffman - taylor finger in a continuous transition as the stabilizing taper vanishes . </S>"
