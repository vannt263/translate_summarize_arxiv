    "( f ) the corresponding bandwidth map obtained by our method.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    acquiring the depth information of 3d scenes is essential for many applications in computer vision and graphics such as 3d modeling , 3dtv and augmented reality .",
    "recently time - of - flight ( tof ) cameras have shown impressive results and become more and more popular , e.g. , kinect v2.0 sensor .",
    "they can obtain dense depth measurements at a high frame rate .",
    "however , the resolution is generally very low and the depth map is often corrupted by strong noise .",
    "tremendous efforts have been put for improving the resolution of depth maps acquired by tof cameras .",
    "the solutions usually go to three categories . in the first category",
    ", single low resolution depth map is upsampled through different data - driven approaches .",
    "it may be achieved by exploiting similarity across relevant depth patches in the same depth map @xcite .",
    "the resolution can also be synthetically increased by exploiting an existing generic database containing large numbers of high resolution depth patches @xcite@xcite which were inspired by the work in @xcite@xcite .",
    "the second approach upsamples the low resolution depth map by integrating multiple low resolution depth maps of the same scene , which may be acquired at the same time but from slightly different views @xcite@xcite or at the different sensing time @xcite .",
    "these existing methods assume that the scene is static .",
    "the third category achieves upsampling through the supports of the high resolution guided color image @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . in this category",
    ", it is assumed that the depth discontinuity on the depth map and the color edge on the color image co - occur on the corresponding regions .",
    "image guided upsampling methods have several advantages against the other two categories and are popular in recent years .",
    "they can yield much better upsampling quality than single depth map upsampling @xcite . besides",
    ", they can achieve larger upsampling factor and do not need any prior database compared with the existing methods @xcite@xcite .",
    "also when compared with the second category , image guided upsampling is not subject to static scene and does not need complicated camera calibration process . despite the obvious advantages against the first two categories of the solutions , the main issues of image guided upsampling are : 1 ) texture copy artifacts on the smooth depth region when the corresponding color image is highly textured ; 2 ) blurring depth discontinuity when the corresponding color image is more homogeneous ; 3 ) performance drops for the case of highly noisy depth maps .    in this paper , a new image guided upsampling approach is proposed .",
    "it well tackles the issues of the existing methods in the same category mentioned above .",
    "we formulate a novel optimization framework with the brand new data term and the new smoothness term compared with other state - of - art models @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "pixel - by - patch validity checking is introduced in the data term in the optimization process instead of pixel - by - pixel checking in the existing methods .",
    "also , a new error norm is proposed to replace the l2 norm .",
    "these together improve the robustness of the framework against the noise .",
    "moreover , the new smoothness term relaxes the strict assumption on the co - occurrence of depth discontinuity and the color edge which is one of major problems in the existing methods of the same category . to further improve the performance of the proposed framework",
    ", we propose a new data driven parameter selection scheme to adaptively estimate the parameter in the optimization process .",
    "experimental results on synthetic and real data show that our method outperforms other state - of - art methods in both visual quality and quantitative accuracy measurement .",
    "encouraging performance retains even for larger upsamping scale such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : section [ secrelatedwork ] is the related work where we briefly present the mrf framework in @xcite and its extension in @xcite which are highly related to our work and then analyze their shortages which motivate the proposed method . in section [ secourmethod ] , we first detail our upsampling model .",
    "then , we give further explanation to show how the newly proposed model is able to handle the constrains mentioned above . in the end , a data driven parameter estimation scheme is proposed to adaptively select the parameter in the model .",
    "section [ secexperiments ] shows our experimental results and the comparison with other state - of - art methods .",
    "we draw the conclusion in section [ secconclusion ] .",
    "+    one of the most well known image guided upsampling methods is based on the markov random fields ( mrf ) @xcite .",
    "it is further extended in @xcite which we denote as nlm - mrf . both methods along with other similar methods such as @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite which adopt the certain cues on the corresponding available color image as the reference to upsample the low resolution depth map .",
    "they all assume that the color edge co - occurs with the depth discontinuity . to clearly demonstrate the essential constrains of the existing methods , we brief the existing modeling as follows .    given a noisy low resolution depth map @xmath2 and the companion high resolution color image @xmath3 , the task is to upsample the @xmath2 to @xmath4 of which the resolution is the same as that of @xmath3 .",
    "the work in @xcite is modeled through mrf as :    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the initial value of @xmath4 , which can be obtained by interpolating @xmath2 through the basic interpolation such as bicubic interpolation @xcite .",
    "@xmath7 represents the coordinate of the high resolution depth map .",
    "@xmath8 is the neighborhoods of @xmath9 in the square patch centered at @xmath9 . the first term in eq.([mrf ] )",
    "is the data term which enforces the similarity between the corresponding positions of the high resolution depth map and the low resolution depth map . the second term in eq.([mrf ] ) is the smoothness term which enforces the smoothness in the neighboring area .",
    "the data term and the smoothness term are balanced by the parameter @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 is defined as follows :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 represents the different channels of the color image .",
    "@xmath14 is a constant defined by the user .",
    "this framework has the following two constrains :    first , it is sensitive to the noise in the depth map . to clearly show this constrain , we take the derivative of the objective function in eq.([mrf ] ) with respect to @xmath15 and let it equal to zero ,",
    "then we can form an iterative formulation as :    @xmath16    it is seen that eq.([mrfupdate ] ) has two important terms : the first term of the numerator is related to the data term in eq.([mrf ] ) and the second term in eq.([mrfupdate ] ) is related to the smoothness term in eq.([mrf ] ) .",
    "the denominator in eq.([mrfupdate ] ) can be considered as a constant for a given @xmath17 .",
    "it is irrelevant to the depth change .",
    "it is therefore skipped in our analysis .",
    "the first term contains only the initial value at the corresponding position . for a noise ( including sensing noise and the noise caused by bicubic interpolation operation ) free input",
    ", the initial value is close to the groundtruth .",
    "however , when the input contains significant noise , the initial value may be far away from the groundtruth .",
    "simply adding this noisy initial value will greatly perturb the upsampling result .",
    "this implies that the data term in eq.([mrf ] ) is sensitive to the noise . from the data term in eq.([mrf ] ) , it is seen that , during the upsampling process , the validity and the quality of depth value at each depth position are measured pixel - by - pixel in order to enforce the similarity between the the corresponding positions of the high resolution depth map and the low resolution depth map .",
    "also , l2 norm is applied to calculate the similarity . from the analysis above",
    ", these two factors together make the data term sensitive to the noise .",
    "second , from the smoothness term in eq.([mrf ] ) , it is seen that the assumption of the co - occurrence of the color edge and the depth discontinuity is unnecessarily enforced .",
    "consequently , the weighting value in this term ( see eq.([mrfupdate ] ) ) is determined by the color difference of the corresponding positions on the color image . however , this assumption does not always well hold .",
    "sometimes the locations with small depth difference on the depth map may contain large color difference on the color image . in this case",
    ", the obtained upsampled depth map may suffer from the texture copy artifacts .",
    "another case is that the positions with large depth difference may contain small color difference on the color image . in such case",
    ", the second term will be close to the mean of the depth value in @xmath8 which will result in blurring depth discontinuities .",
    "the work in @xcite extended the mrf by adding a more regularization term called the non - local means term .",
    "moreover , unlike the weight in eq.([colorweight ] ) which is only based on the color image , they further combine segmentation , color information , and edge saliency as well as the bicubic upsampled depth map to define the weight .",
    "although the work in @xcite somehow improves the performance when compared with @xcite , it does not upgrade these two terms significantly and thus the performance improvement is limited .",
    "figure [ syntheticcomparison ] illustrates the @xmath18 upsampling results of a synthetic depth map . in this synthetic experiment",
    ", we show that these two methods are not robust against the noise and can not handle the case where the color edge and the depth discontinuity are not consistent .",
    "we will further illustrate the texture copy artifacts of these two methods in the experimental part .",
    "in this section , we describe our optimization framework for upsampling the noisy low resolution depth map to a higher resolution one given a companion color image .",
    "different from the previous work , we do not necessarily assume the co - occurrence of the color edge and the depth discontinuity .",
    "meanwhile , it is more robust against the noise .",
    "our upsampling model consists of two terms : the data term and the smoothness term .",
    "given a noisy low resolution depth map @xmath2 , it is first interpolated to @xmath6 by bicubic interpolation .",
    "then our upsampling model is formulated as :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the data term that makes the result to be consistent with the input .",
    "@xmath21 is the smoothness term that reflects prior knowledge of the smoothness of our solution .",
    "these two terms are balanced with the parameter @xmath22 . + * the data term @xmath20 * : the data term is defined as :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is a normalized gaussian window that decreases the influence of @xmath25 where @xmath26 is far from @xmath9 :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is a constant that is defined by the user .",
    "@xmath29 is the robust error norm function that we denote as the exponential error norm .",
    "this function has long been used in image denoising such as local mode filtering @xcite and nonlocal filtering @xcite .",
    "it is defined as :    @xmath30    the proposed exponential error norm is illustrated in figure [ errornormfunctioncomparision](b ) to have a comparison with the l2 norm illustrated in figure [ errornormfunctioncomparision](a ) .",
    "our data term is different from that of previous methods @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite which only use pixel - by - pixel depth difference modeled with l2 error norm in the data term . in eq.([mymodel ] ) , it can be seen that the new data term measures the depth differences pixel - by - patch by taking each reference pixel s neighboring region into account . according to @xcite ,",
    "depth map is quite piece - wise smooth and thus pixel - by - patch difference calculation is more robust to the noise than pixel - by - pixel depth difference calculation .",
    "such calculation is further normalized by gaussian window @xmath24 in order to better maintain the local depth similarity in the neighboring area .",
    "then , the pixel - by - patch depth difference is further modeled with the exponential error norm defined in eq.([erronormfunction ] ) which is quite robust against the outliers @xcite .",
    "these together make the data term robust against the noise and will be further theoretically explained in section [ secadvantageovermrf ] . +",
    "* the smoothness term @xmath31 * : the smoothness term is guided by the companion color image .",
    "it is defined as :    @xmath32    we adopt the same function in eq.([erronormfunction ] ) to model the smoothness term , i.e. @xmath33 . the color guided weight @xmath34 is defined as :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the same as eq.([spatialweight ] ) and @xmath37 is the same as eq.([colorweight ] ) .",
    "note that the color guided weight in our model is quite similar as that of the mrf in @xcite except that there is an additional gaussian window @xmath24 .",
    "however , the mrf in @xcite enforces the co - occurrence of the color edge and the depth discontinuity through eq.([colorweight ] ) .",
    "depth discontinuity cues are completely based on color image in their work ( as seen in eq.([mrfupdate ] ) ) .",
    "instead , the smoothness term ( i.e. eq.([smoothnessterm ] ) ) in the proposed framework relaxes such strict dependence due to @xmath38 . as we will further show in section [ secadvantageovermrf ]",
    ", the smoothness term will result in a color image guided bilateral filter on the depth map at each update .",
    "depth discontinuity cues are not only based on the color image but also based on the depth map itself during the optimization process .",
    "it is more capable of the case where the color edge and the depth discontinuity are not consistent with each other",
    ". this property will be the key element that makes our model tackle the texture copy artifacts and blur of depth discontinuities .",
    "we will further theoretically explain these in section [ secadvantageovermrf ] .",
    "+      we further analyze our upsampling model in order to demonstrate its advantages . by taking the derivative of the objective function of our model in eq.([mymodel ] ) with respect to @xmath15 ,",
    "let it equal to zero and form the iterative formulation as :    @xmath39    where we define    @xmath40    @xmath41 is the derivative of @xmath42 defined in eq.([erronormfunction ] ) .",
    "our method has the following advantages :    first , it is more robust against the noise in the input .",
    "the first term is the weighted sum of the initial depth values in @xmath8 .",
    "the weights are based on the difference of the latest updated depth map and the initial depth map , which is further normalized by the gaussian window @xmath24 .",
    "this term is related to the data term in the proposed framework .",
    "compared with eq.([mrfupdate ] ) , it can be shown that , in the newly proposed data term , the accuracy of upsampling in each round at each pixel is not affected by the initial upsampling value of the reference pixel only .",
    "instead , the accuracy of upsampling in each round is based on the local measurement in its neighboring area @xmath8 .",
    "this results from the proposed pixel - by - patch depth difference measurement and is more robust against the noise .",
    "this effort is further enhanced by introducing @xmath43 which results from the proposed exponential error norm .",
    "when the original depth map contains significant noise , the depth value in the neighboring area is unlikely smooth which results in large @xmath44 .",
    "this further causes the decrease of @xmath45 . finally , such noisy area will have less effects on @xmath46 in each round of upsampling",
    "consequently , such data term is more robust to the noise . to our best understanding , it is a brand new data term used in the optimization framework for image guided depth upsampling .    the second term in the numerator in eq.([myupdate ] )",
    "is related to the smoothness term .",
    "compared with the counterpart in eq.([mrfupdate ] ) , it is shown that the existing methods enforce the assumption on the consistence between the color edge and the depth discontinuity , where the weight @xmath24 is only determined by the color difference in the neighboring area on the color image .",
    "in eq.([myupdate ] ) , it is shown that we relax such strict assumption by extending color image guided bilateral filtering onto each round of upsampling depth map @xmath47 .",
    "the weight value is determined by three factors : 1 ) the color similarity in the local area ( same as the existing method ) ; 2 ) the distance between the reference pixel and its neighboring pixel ( i.e. @xmath24 ) ; 3 ) the difference of depth value between the reference pixel and its neighboring pixels ( i.e. @xmath48 ) .",
    "@xmath49 reflects the property of the depth map . for the case where the depth region is homogeneous but",
    "the color information is not smooth at the corresponding area , @xmath48 can eliminate the efforts caused by @xmath50 .",
    "thus , it reduces the texture copy artifacts . for the case where depth region contains depth discontinuity but",
    "the color is smooth at the corresponding area on the color image , the second term will be close to a bilateral filter where @xmath48 well preserves the depth discontinuity .",
    "thus the proposed smoothness term is more capable of cases where the color edge is not consistent with the depth discontinuity .",
    "we do not assume the color edge and the depth discontinuity to be necessarily consistent with each other .",
    "figure [ syntheticcomparison](g ) shows the result by our method .",
    "it is clear that the noise in the homogeneous regions have been well smoothed and the depth discontinuities can be properly preserved even there is no color edge corresponding to the depth discontinuity on the depth map .      in this paper ,",
    "the parameter @xmath51 is denoted as the _ bandwidth _ of the exponential error norm function in eq.([erronormfunction ] ) which is similar to the function of the tone term in the bilateral filter @xcite .",
    "a large @xmath52 has better noise smoothing but may over smooth the depth discontinuities .",
    "a small @xmath52 can better preserve the depth discontinuities but performs poorly in noise smoothing . in this section",
    ", we describe an optimization method that adapts @xmath52 to each pixel on the depth map .",
    "it is a data driven adaptive bandwidth selection . because the depth map is quite piece wise smooth , we assume that the bandwidth is also regular and smooth .",
    "we add another regularization term that consists of the l2 norm of the gradient of @xmath53 to the objective function in eq.([mymodel ] ) . that is :    @xmath54    by minimizing eq.([bandwidthmodel ] ) with respect to @xmath55 through the steepest gradient descent according to :    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the given updating rate and the derivative of the objective function is given by    @xmath58}+\\\\      & \\alpha \\sum\\limits_{j\\in",

    "the computation cost for @xmath61 is also quite small .",
    "so the computation cost of the bandwidth selection step is quite small indeed .",
    "figure [ coverfigure](f ) illustrates a bandwidth map obtained by our method where dark regions correspond to smaller bandwidth values and bright regions correspond to larger bandwidth values .",
    "it is clear that this bandwidth map well corresponds to the character of the depth map shown in figure [ coverfigure](b ) .",
    "in this section , we perform the quantitative and qualitative evaluation of our method on both the synthetic data and real data .",

    "even when compared with the most recent proposed methods in @xcite and @xcite , our method have smaller rmse in almost all the cases .",

    "however , our method only needs a few iterations to converge , for example , less than 5 iterations for @xmath77 upsampling and less than 50 iterations for @xmath1 upsampling which only needs very few minutes .",
    "the computation cost of the method in @xcite is also quite huge due to its complex shape - based color guided weights .",
