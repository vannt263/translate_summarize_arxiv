    "the restriction that triple or higher order crossover points do not occur implies that such spheres never touch @xmath4 at more than two points .",
    "we are especially interested in the generic properties of the double - crossover set @xmath35 consisting of non - caustic points at which precisely two rays intersect .    * generic property 1 . * _ a caustic point is not also a crossover point .",

    "there are two possibilities .",
    "first , suppose there were a continuous curve of points on @xmath4 containing @xmath31 whose rays all cross the ray from @xmath31",
    ". then all points on the curve would be equidistant from @xmath37 and have equal values of their smallest principle radius of curvature .",
    "a small deformation of @xmath4 in the neighborhood of @xmath31 ( keeping @xmath31 and the radius of curvature at @xmath31 fixed ) would remove this degeneracy .",
    "( the structural instability of this situation also follows directly from the theory of generic caustics . ) second , suppose the ray from a point @xmath32 on @xmath4 crosses the ray from @xmath31 , so that the osculating sphere @xmath38 touches @xmath4 at @xmath32 . then a small outward deformation of @xmath4 in the neighborhood of @xmath32 would eliminate the crossover .",
    "thus a joint caustic - crossover point can be eliminated by a perturbation .    * generic property 2 . * _ considered as a subset of minkowski space , the double - crossover set @xmath35 is a smooth , open , spacelike 2-surface .",
    "_ let @xmath32 be a point in @xmath35 resulting from the crossing of null rays from points @xmath40 and @xmath41 on @xmath4 .",

    "since , for sufficiently small neighborhoods , there is no caustic in @xmath43 , this geodesic map is one - to - one and smooth so that @xmath43 is a smooth open portion of null hypersurface containing @xmath32 .",

    "then , in the tangent space of @xmath32 , @xmath43 and @xmath46 intersect in the @xmath48 plane .",

    "_ consider a sphere tangent to @xmath4 at five or more points , whose center lies at the projection @xmath49 of the corresponding crossover point . since generically four points determine a unique sphere , an outward deformation of @xmath4 leaving precisely four of these points points fixed would reduce the crossover to a four - fold intersection .    the conformal construction of the curved space event horizon ( described in sec .",
    "[ sec : hor ] ) preserves the structure of the the underlying flat space crossover set .",
    "the generic properties of an _ arbitrary _ curved space event horizon are important ingredients of black hole physics .",
    "certain of the flat space properties generalize easily to curved space , e.g. the spacelike nature of the crossover set .",

    "we now specialize to the case of the ingoing wavefront from an ellipsoid @xmath4 described in cartesian coordinates at time @xmath21 by points @xmath50 satisfying @xmath51 where we set @xmath52 ( in the non - degenerate case ) . thus the @xmath53-axis is the shortest axis , the @xmath54-axis is the longest axis and the @xmath55-axis is intermediate .",
    "the reflection symmetry with respect to the cartesian axes allows us to reduce our analysis to the positive octant @xmath56 . while reflection symmetry simplifies the analysis , the caustic structure of the wavefront is generic due to the absence of continuous symmetries , so that it is preserved under perturbations which break reflection symmetry .",

    ", a number of results have appeared in the literature , which show that an event horizon has to exhibit spherical topology on spacelike slices in the late stages of black hole evolution @xcite .",
    "it thus came as a surprise when a toroidal event horizon was found in numerical simulations of the collapse of rotating clusters @xcite .",
    "in particular , this seemed to provide the possibility of violating topological censorship @xcite , as was pointed out by jacobson and venkatarami @xcite .",
    "however , because the crossover surface is spacelike all causal curves are homotopically trivial , even though the slices of the horizon contain handles @xcite . in effect , the hole in the torus shrinks faster than the speed of light , in obedience to topological censorship .",
    "moreover , it is possible to choose slicings of the horizon which exhibit arbitrarily complicated topologies in the early phase of black hole formation . where these slices meet the spacelike crossover surface , i.e. where new generators enter the horizon",
    ", they will in general not be smooth .",
    "some of the theorems which establish spherical topology of the event horizon explicitly assume smoothness of the horizon , or that no new generators enter .",
    "the full interpretation of the results is difficult without a better understanding of collapse physics , i.e. without additional information from the construction of the surrounding spacetime .",
    "these models thus serve a twofold purpose : on the one hand , they are hoped to serve as a guide to explore new physical situations  in particular by setting up double - null initial data . on the other hand",
    ", they make available a class of essentially analytic models that can help to understand phenomena that appear in the study of 3d collapse with complementary methods .",
    "examples are the spheroidal case , where these models help to understand the results of previous numerical simulations .",
    "the availability of such simple models is likely to be even more important in the more complicated generic case .    in order to model a generic binary collision we modified the model used for the axisymmetric collision only minimally ; in particular , we retained the choice @xmath223 .",
    "if instead the function @xmath185 has strong ray dependence , in particular if we choose @xmath286 , a rich set of histories of topology change can be produced with our simple choice of slicing .",
    "this fulfills the expectation that the model is capable of yielding a large variety of black holes and can provide the null data for studying a variety of waveforms .",
    "however , in many of these models the lifetimes of the individual components are of the order as the time scale for the appearance of nontrivial topology .",
    "these cases should thus be interpreted as the formation of a single , highly distorted black hole .",
    "all models of the binary black hole merger type , which displayed two horizon components with long individual lifetimes , also exhibited an intermediate toroidal phase before the final black hole formed with spherical topology .",
    "since this behavior is stable under perturbations , toroidal event horizons turn out not to be a mere oddity but arise generically in black hole collisions .",
