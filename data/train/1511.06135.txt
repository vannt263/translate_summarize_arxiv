    "studies of atomic and molecular quantum dynamics are in the center of interests of contemporary atomic , molecular and optical physics .",
    "there are various ways to induce such dynamics , but a very distinct one is to expose the atomic / molecular systems to an intense and coherent electromagnetic radiation . as a consequence of this coupling ,",
    "new and diverse phenomena occur . amongst the plethora of processes which take place , the two most prominent ones are the high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) and the above - threshold ionization ( ati ) .",
    "they both lie at the core of the so - called attosecond physics  @xcite .",
    "the quasi - classical picture of these two phenomena relies on the so - called three - step or simple man s model  @xcite .",
    "briefly , this approach can be summarized listing the subsequent steps : ( i ) tunnel ionization due to the intense and low frequency laser field ; ( ii ) acceleration of the free electron by the laser electric field , and ( iii ) re - collision with the parent ion after the temporally oscillating laser electric field reverses the direction of the electronic motion . in hhg",
    "the electron recombines with the remaining ion - core and the excess of energy is converted into a high energy photon  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if the electron is re - scattered by the atomic potential , it gains even more kinetic energy and contributes to the high energy parts of the ati spectrum  @xcite .",
    "commonly , the laser ionization process is understood by invoking the quasi - static tunnel ionization picture . in this approach in every time ( short ) interval the laser electric field is considered as a static electric field .",
    "this assumption is valid for low photon frequencies  long wavelengths , and the atomic or molecular electron is considered to quickly tunnel out through the barrier created by the combined potentials of the laser electric field and the attractive coulomb atomic / molecular potential .",
    "the main consequence of this description is that the ionization rate presents a maximum whenever the barrier becomes the thinnest , which correlates with the electric field maxima .",
    "this prediction appears to be also valid in the so - called non - adiabatic tunnel ionization , i.e.  when the laser electric field is considered to change significantly , while the electron is escaping from the attractive potential of the atomic or molecular core . for these cases",
    "the ionization rate exhibits a single maximum during each half - cycle of the laser electric field oscillation  @xcite .    when molecules are used as driven media , the above cited assumptions should be revised , considering that there can be multiple bursts of ionization within a half - cycle of the laser electric field  @xcite . by using different numerical models and simulations ,",
    "it was confirmed that these bursts are related to the effect of transient electron localization ( el ) at one of the heavy nuclei of the molecule on a sub - fs time scale  @xcite .",
    "generally , a sub - cycle oscillation of the electron density occurs after the molecular ion has been stretched to intermediate internuclear distances , and it is due to a trapping of the electron population in a pair of so - called charge - resonance ( cr ) states  @xcite . for the case of a simple h@xmath1 molecular ion , they are the energetically lowest @xmath2 and @xmath3 states .",
    "it is likely , however , that both the multiple ionization bursts , and the cr appear in other more complex molecules as well .",
    "in addition , el appears to be the responsible of the strongly enhanced ionization rate , observed for stretched molecules beyond its equilibrium internuclear separation  @xcite , and , moreover , it was shown el can be manipulated , joint with the control of photoabsorption / photodissociation , by using different alignment techniques ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .    in the theoretical modeling of conventional strong laser - matter interaction ,",
    "the main assumption is that both the laser electric field ( @xmath4 ) and its vector potential associated ( @xmath5 ) are spatially homogeneous in the region where the electron develops its motion and only their time dependence is considered , i.e.  @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "this is a legitimate assumption since the fields change at most on the scale of the wavelength ( @xmath8 nm ) , while the typical size of a laser focus is between several tens to a couple of hundreds microns ( @xmath9 m ) .",
    "these scales have to be compared with the size of the electronic ground states ( say of the order of angstroms ( @xmath10 m ) ) , and the size of the typical electron excursions , estimated classically using @xmath11 ; even these sizes remain sub - wavelength and do not reach more than tens of nm ( @xmath12 m ) for longer wavelengths and higher laser intensities ( note that @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the wavelength of the driven laser and @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the laser intensity )  @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "the fields generated using surface plasmons are spatially dependent on a nanometer scale . by exploiting the surface plasmon resonance ( spr ) , locally enhanced electric field",
    "can be induced around gold bow - tie nano - antennas .",
    "the enhanced field boosts up the low incoming laser intensity , specified in the 10@xmath17 w @xmath18 range , by more than 30 db , which becomes then strong enough to exceed the threshold laser intensity for hhg generation in noble gases  @xcite .",
    "the pulse repetition rate , typically in the mhz domain , remains unaltered without any extra pumping or cavity attachment ; this is one of the main advantages of this setup . from a theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "plasmonic fields open a wide range of possibilities to enhance and/or shape spectral and spatial properties of the incoming fields  @xcite .",
    "a peculiar property of this plasmonic fields is that the enhanced laser electric field is not spatially homogeneous , on the scales and in regions of comparable dimensions with the size of the electronic excursion @xmath19 , where the electron dynamics takes place .",
    "consequently , significant changes in the laser - matter processes arise .",
    "there has been a remarkable theoretical activity on this subject recently  @xcite . in most of the contributions ,",
    "however , only the hhg and ati processes in atoms were studied and analyzed exclusively .",
    "only recently investigations of hhg in simple molecules , h@xmath0 , driven by plasmonic fields were presented  @xcite . in the present paper we focus on the question to what extent plasmonic fields could configure a novel and reliable tool to control molecular dynamics , and in particular the electron localization ( el ) . as mentioned above , these fields are spatially inhomogeneous and thus they offer to our disposal a new degree of control , which could help us to obtain an even more precise manipulation of the electron and molecular dynamics at a sub - cycle time scale .",
    "our article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we describe the methods , including here a brief description about the set up that could be utilized for the generation of plasmonic enhanced fields and its main characteristics .",
    "once we have defined our theoretical model and observables of interest , we then analyze them and discuss their properties and implications in sec .",

    "iv , we end the paper with conclusions and a brief outlook .",
