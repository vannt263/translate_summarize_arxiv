    "however , the dominant energy source of the enormous evaporation remains unknown .",
    "one proposed possible scenario is that high bolometric energy input at the semi - major axis @xmath5 au itself produces the hydrodynamic escape .",
    "pc13 have constructed a radiative - hydrodynamic model of kic 12557548bassuming a parker - type wind driven by hot planetary surface with the equilibrium temperature @xmath1 2000 k. they concluded that a planet with mass @xmath6 can account for the mass loss rate of kic 12557548b .",
    "the hydrodynamic escape driven by x - ray and ultraviolet ( xuv ) radiations as has been discussed for hot jupiters is another candidate for the energy source .",
    "however , an xuv observation of the transit is impossible for kic 12557548with current satellites due to its distance .    instead , we focus on the time - series of the transit depth . in this letter , we reanalyze the _ kepler _ data of kic 12557548 , but for longer period @xmath1 3.5 yr , than that analyzed by r12 .",
    "we find the correlation between the transit depth and the modulation of the light curve using starspots .",
    "these results indicate that the evaporation of kic 12557548bresults from some energy related to the stellar activity , rather than the bolometric one .",
    "we analyze archived long cadence data of kic 12557548between quarter 1 and 15(q1-q15 ; @xmath1 3.5 yr ) using the @xmath7 package to process the data @xcite .",

    "we also compute periodogram of the cotrended light curve excluding the detected transit duration ( bottom panel in figure [ fig : period ] ) .",
    "we find the most prominent peak at @xmath4 days and its harmonic peaks .",
    "we also performed high resolution spectroscopy for kic 12557548 with the high dispersion spectrograph on the subaru telescope .",
    "we adopted the standard `` ra '' setup with the image slicer no.2 ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 nm ) .",

    "the resultant systematic error in @xmath22 is quite uncertain because of the faintness of the target star ( @xmath23 ) , but we can safely rule out a large rotational velocity , @xmath24 km s@xmath21 , corresponding to a rapid rotation @xmath25 days ( we assume @xmath26 ; r12 ) .    on the assumption that this value is the stellar rotation period , the shortest periodicity found in the transit depth variation @xmath3 days is consistent with the stellar rotation period .",
    "we concentrate on the periodicity of @xmath27 through the rest of the paper .",
    "we fold the transit depth variation with @xmath27 ( the top and middle panels in figure [ fig : lcfold ] ) .",
    "the mean value of binned data has @xmath1 30 % variation .",
    "we also fold the cotrended light curve with @xmath27 ( the bottom panel ) and find that the folded cotrended light curve is negatively correlated with the folded depth variation . a large starspot",
    "can survive for many years @xcite .",
    "the 2 % variation of the folded light curve can be interpreted as long term variation due to a large starspot associated with a local active area .",
    "hence our interpretation of the anti - correlation is that the planet tends to make deeper occultation when facing the large starspot .",
    "in general , stellar visibility depends on competition among starspots and faculae . in the case of the sun",
    ", spot modeling predicts that a single active area decreases the visibility only for the angle between the line - of - sight and the local active area on the stellar surface @xmath28 due to the large faculae - to - spots ratio @xmath29 .",
    "however , for several stars with large flux modulation , smaller values of @xmath30 were estimated from the spot modeling and faculae for these stars do not contribute significantly to the visibility . throughout the rest of the paper , we assume that the local active area decreases stellar visibility .        the stellar visibility variation results in the apparent variation of the measured depth via normalization . considered this effect for different epochs of stellar activity ( a @xmath1 1 year interval ) .",
    "we use a similar formalism although we consider this effect during one stellar rotation .",
    "the apparent variation of the depth @xmath31 is related to that of the visibility during one revolution , @xmath32 as @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the measured depths when the active area is located on the side visible to us and the opposite side , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the visibilities for the two side . denoting the average surface brightness of photosphere by @xmath38 and @xmath39 for the two sides and",
    "that along the trajectory of transit by @xmath40 , @xmath41 , we can express @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "assuming that the spot crossing is negligible ( @xmath45 ) and @xmath46 , we obtain @xmath47 .",
    "if the surface brightness outside the spot areas is homogeneous , we obtain @xmath48 . in our case , we expect the 0 - 4 % variation of @xmath49 to be anti - correlated to the stellar visibility .",
    "since the observed variation is @xmath50 30 % , we conclude that the periodicity of the depth variation synchronized with the stellar rotation is not a false positive .",
    "@xcite found seasonal variation of transit depth for hat - p-7 b due to instrumental systematics .",
    "they did not report any other periodicity @xmath51 1 yr . since the periodicities @xmath52 and @xmath53 are larger than period of a quarter , instrumental systematics should be considered in further studies .",
    "to consider possible scenarios of evaporation , two important constraints from observation , the mass - loss rate @xmath54 and the planet radius @xmath55 , should be taken into account .",
    "the mass - loss rate was constrained by both r12 and pc13 in similar but slightly different ways , @xmath56 and @xmath57 . here",
    "we summarize the essential part of their derivation .",
    "the @xmath54 can be estimated using the total cross section of transit @xmath58 ( we adopt @xmath59 ) , dust density @xmath60 , typical length of optical path @xmath61 and typical time scale @xmath62 , @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the gas - dust ratio . r12",
    "adopted @xmath65 hr , assuming the typical velocity of outflow @xmath66 km / s , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 as a typical grain size , which yields @xmath69 .",
    "pc13 uses an orbital period of @xmath70 hr , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , which results in @xmath73 .",
    "the grain size estimated from the forward scattering supported @xmath74 .",
    "we computed the auto correlation of the @xmath75 and found a flat correlation for a time interval , @xmath76 days .",
    "it supports @xmath77 . assuming that the dust density is an order of @xmath78 , we use @xmath79 as a fiducial constraint of the mass loss rate .",
    "another constraint is the upper limit of @xmath55 .",
    "estimated the 1 @xmath80 upper limit of the maximum planetary radius as @xmath81 translating photometric accuracy of the phase folded light curve of no - transit - like feature ( around the period in red in figure [ fig : tradep ] ) into the radius .    interpreting the starspots - depth relation in a straight forward fashion",
    ", the atmospheric escape rate should correlate with the area of the active area on the stellar surface . because the optical flux does not change much ( @xmath1 2% ) and is negatively correlated with the transit depth , the bolometric radiation is unlikely to be a source of the relation .",
    "strong xuv radiation is often related to stellar spots since the xuv flares originate from magnetic loops .",
    "the x and/or uv periodicity with rotation were found in several stars . while the sunspots exhibit much smaller variation than kic 12557548 , an order - of - magnitude of variability in solar x - ray has been observed over a month . we found a sudden 6 % increase in the flux during 30 minutes similar to the flare in the short cadence data .",
    "such a strong flare will create strong xuv variation in a timescale of hours , which might account for the transit depth variation in every transit .",
    "however , r12 questioned whether the input energy is sufficient to account for the mass loss rate .",
    "we revisit this problem using the theoretical mass - radius relation of sub / super - earths with several different compositions . because of the lack of xuv observation , we manage to estimate the xuv flux of kic 12557548from the x - ray flux - rotation relation , which provides @xmath82 erg / s for @xmath83 days .",
    "considering the fact that kic 12557548has a very large active area that creates 2 % continuous flux variation over 3.5 yr , we adopt @xmath84 , corresponding to @xmath85 erg / s .    in the energy - limit regime",
    ", the mass loss rate can be estimated as @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the radius where gas is bound to the planet , @xmath88 is the radius where the bulk of incoming xuv flux is absorbed , @xmath89 is the efficiency for converting the input energy to the kinetic energy of the atmosphere . because the base level of the xuv deposition @xmath88 is under discussion",
    ", we adopt the radius where optical depth @xmath90 conservatively , i.e. @xmath91 .    a correction factor for the roche lobe effect , @xmath92 , is given by , @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the hill radius , @xmath95    on the basis of @xcite , we compute the mass - radius relation of planets composed of 100 % water , 50% water+50% rocky core , 10% water+90 % rocky core ( volatile - rich planets ) , 100 % rock , and 100 % iron assuming the equilibrium temperature of kic 12557548b(@xmath1 1800 k ) .",
    "we neglect the contribution of a thin atmosphere , which should be evaporating , for the 100 % rock and iron planets to compute the relation .",
    "the interior structure of the planet is computed with equations of hydrostatic equilibrium , mass conservation , and energy conservation ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and the equation of state .",
    "a detailed description is found in @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : mlr ] ( left ) shows the mass - radius relation of these planets .",
    "we find that the radius of volatile - rich ( the water fraction being @xmath96 10 % ) planets can not be smaller than the upper limit of planetary radius @xmath97 because the gravity can not bind the atmosphere",
    ". therefore kic 12557548bis unlikely to be a volatile - rich planet . figure [ fig : mlr ] ( right ) shows the @xmath54 expected in the energy - limit case , assuming the relatively high flux @xmath98 and an assumption for the efficiency of @xmath99 .",
    "the density of the planet composed of iron is too dense to obtain the mass loss rate needed .",
    "the @xmath54 of the rocky planet is @xmath100/gyr .",
    "the roche lobe effect increases @xmath54 to two times larger than that without the tide .",
    "r12 discussed that the xuv luminosity is at least a factor of 10 too low compared to the luminosity needed assuming @xmath101 .",
    "the roche lobe effect and the assumption of @xmath89 are likely to cause the difference by one order - of - magnitude in @xmath54 between r12 and us .",
    "hence , a rocky planet is possible as a candidate for kic 12557548b .",
    "one might consider that volatile components on the rocky planet increase the planetary effective radius and @xmath54 .",
    "we derive the surface pressure needed to increase the transit radius @xmath102 to @xmath103 times of the radius of the silicate core @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) though the observed transit radius is not identical to the effective radius for equation ( [ eq : energylimited ] ) .",
    "we adopt @xmath106 , i.e. @xmath107 times larger cross section . the atmospheric height from the ground to the point where the optical depth through the planetary limb is unity is estimated by assuming an isothermal atmosphere with temperature @xmath108 and a power - law dependence of the opacity on pressure ( @xmath109 ; * ? ? ?",

    "thus the na atmosphere vaporized at the equilibrium temperature is unlikely to increase the cross section of @xmath135 .",
    "though we assumed the equilibrium temperature as the surface temperature for simplicity , further study of the atmospheric structure over magma ocean is needed to derive the realistic contribution of the volatile components .",
    "star - planet magnetic interaction is another possible scenario for a catastrophic evaporation that correlates with stellar activity .",
