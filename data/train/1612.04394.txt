    "our universe is believed to have experienced a period of inflationary phase in the very early times during which its size was enlarged by a factor of about @xmath0 . during inflation",
    "all unwanted primordial relics produced from the big bang can be washed out @xcite . within this cosmological paradigm ,",
    "primordial density fluctuations of quantum origin can be causally generated and then can provide the seeds for the formation of the large - scale structure ( lss ) and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies @xcite .",
    "after inflation , it is important to dynamically release the energy stored in the potential of the inflaton field to produce other matter fields so that the universe can reach thermal equilibrium .",
    "this process is dubbed as the reheating phase .",
    "the energy transfer from the inflaton field to regular matter was initially studied using the perturbation theory at first order @xcite .",
    "such an analysis does not take into account the fact that the inflaton field at the end of inflation is in a highly homogeneous condensate state rather than an assembly of free perturbative quanta . as was pointed out in @xcite , during the energy transfer from the inflaton to matter field , which are usually modelled by two scalar fields",
    ", there exists a sizeable parameter space that contains the parametric resonance instability even if their coupling is weak .",
    "this instability was soon applied to realize a phase of preheating in detail in @xcite , during which the energy transfer from the inflaton to matter fields becomes very dramatic .",
    "similar results were found in alternative paradigms to inflation , such as in bounce cosmology @xcite . for recent reviews of cosmic preheating , we refer to @xcite .",
    "the key aspect of the present paradigm of cosmic preheating at weak coupling is that the inflaton field oscillations after inflation can make a periodical contribution to the effective mass term of the matter field , which is often described the well - known floquet theory @xcite . as a result ,",
    "this weakly coupled cosmic preheating , when combined with observations , can be applied to constrain cosmological parameters of the very early universe even if the coupling between the inflaton and matter field is weak .",
    "namely , the post - inflationary background parameters were studied with a perturbative treatment in refs .",
    "@xcite ; and the evolutions of primordial fluctuations during preheating were investigated in refs .",
    "these works have shown that the study of cosmic preheating can play an important role in placing constraints on the cosmology of the very early universe , such as inflationary models .    however , very few study was to address the cosmic preheating at strong couplings , which was expected to occur in some early universe models at extremely high energy scales , namely , see @xcite .",
    "study of cosmic preheating at strong coupling enables us to gain more insights on more generic paradigm about this process .",
    "recently , a new description of cosmic preheating at strong coupling was proposed by virtue of the holographic superconductor model in @xcite . in this mechanism ,",
    "the preheating process of the inflaton strongly coupled with a class of fermionic matter field can be mimicked by superfluid and normal components of a superconductor , which is holographically described by a five dimensional metastable hairy black hole in the anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetime . in order to accommodate with an expanding universe , we take the boundary of this background to be of the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) form . this scenario is manifestly different from many other holographic models of cosmology in which the universe is the bulk spacetime , and accordingly , there is a dual quantum field theory on the boundary , as were widely studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "the bulk spacetime adopted in @xcite is then a ads - frw and can be mapped to the well - known ads - schwarzschild black hole @xcite ( see also @xcite ) via coordinate transformation .",
    "a similar picture addressing the reheating through holographic thermalization was studied in @xcite .",

    ".        one goal of the present paper is to study in detail the evolution of the quasi - normal modes ( qnms ) of a metastable hairy black hole . with this analysis ,",
    "one is able to characterize the process of cosmic preheating at strong coupling quantitatively . among all qnms",
    ", there always exists one mode of which the imaginary part of the frequency becomes positive , and hence , can drive the cosmological background evolving from the metastable state , which duals to the inflaton - dominant state on the boundary , to the stable state , which duals to the boundary state dominated by the matter field .",
    "this can be read by performing a coordinate transformation from the ads - schwarzschild geometry to the ads - frw one .",
    "thus , the second goal of this paper is to provide a detailed analysis of the holographic renormalization within the ads - frw background .",
    "one can see that proper renormalization of the theory requires addition of a curvature term to the frw boundary . by taking the derivatives of the renormalized action with respect to the sources",
    ", one can obtain relevant vacuum expectation values of the operators , one of which represents for the evolution of the density of the matter field produced during preheating .",
    "the rest parts of the paper are organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the holographic superconductor model with a flat boundary .",
    "the background geometry of this model is a meta - stable hairy black hole in the probe limit .",
    "then in section iii , we proceed with the calculation of qnm analysis under this background , which are conformally related to the unstable modes on the frw boundary .",
    "afterwards , we do the conformal transformation in section iv , and then , perform the holographic renormalization within the ads - frw background .",
    "section v is devoted to a conclusion of our analysis with a discussion .",
    "our goal is to describe the dynamical evolution of the cosmic system in terms of an inflaton field and a second matter field at strong coupling .",
    "the initial state is dominated by the inflaton .",
    "the evolution diminishes the inflaton field and amplifies the matter field .",
    "the end moment is expected to be a matter dominated phase .    following the proposal of ref .",
    "@xcite , we describe the scenario of cosmic preheating by adopting a holographic superconductor type model as follows @xcite : @xmath1,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have introduced @xmath2 , which is the field strength of the @xmath3 gauge field in the bulk spacetime . in this action",
    ", a complex scalar @xmath4 is introduced as dual to the inflaton field , and , the @xmath3 gauge field @xmath5 is introduced as dual to the fermionic matter field . accordingly , in this scenario , the inflaton field is assumed to be converted to fermionic fields only .",
    "we note that the building up of fermionic matter fields would eventually affect the expansion of the universe through the backreaction to the metric .",
    "we would like to examine this issue by including the generation of cosmological fluctuations in a forthcoming work @xcite .",
    "moreover , the model parameter @xmath6 represents the mass of @xmath4 and @xmath7 is a parameter in the coupling between the inflaton and the matter field , which is found to be related with the order of phase transition @xcite ( see also @xcite for the analyses of phase transitions in case of holographic superconductors ) .",
    "the model is required to be embedded in the background geometry with an frw boundary , so that it can be applied to describe the expanding universe such as ours . in the probe limit",
    ", such a background with an frw boundary can be obtained by performing a coordinate transformation on an ads - schwarzschild black hole @xcite . with this process",
    ", one can significantly simplify the calculation , since we can first study the dynamics of @xmath8 and @xmath5 in the ads - schwarzschild background , and then , we can translate the results to the background of a thermally expanding universe by performing a coordinate transformation .",
    "the aforementioned model is embedded in the @xmath9-dimensional planar ads - schwarzschild black hole background , @xmath10 where the metric factor is given by @xmath11 , and , @xmath12 .",
    "the vanishing condition of the metric factor yields the radius of the horizon to be @xmath13 and in the probe limit , the corresponding temperature is related with the horizon via @xmath14 we set the ads radius @xmath15 from now for simplicity .",
    "note that the thermodynamics of the system is only a function of the chemical potential ( or equivalently density ) of matter field .",
    "in order to study thermodynamics , we turn on @xmath4 and @xmath16 , of which the dynamics can be derived by solving the background equations of motion .",
    "it is convenient to use the dimensionless radial coordinate @xmath17 to express the equations of motion , of which the forms are given by @xmath18 if one solve the above equations near the ads boundary with @xmath19 ( where @xmath20 is the cutoff which is related to the ultra - violate cutoff of the dual field theory ) , @xmath4 and @xmath8 can be expressed in the following asymptotic forms , the expansions contain additional logarithmic terms . ]",
    "@xmath21 where @xmath22    as was reported in @xcite , for the purpose of cosmic preheating in a realistic universe , the dimension parameter @xmath23 is taken to be @xmath24 .",
    "also one can choose @xmath25 ( which satisfies the breitenlohner - freedman bound in the ads@xmath26 spacetime ) such that @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "in this case , both @xmath29 and @xmath30 are normalizable modes , which correspond to the _ vev _ and the source of the inflaton field , respectively . moreover , the value of @xmath8 on the boundary yields the chemical potential @xmath31 for the fermionic matter field .",
    "thus , one can learn from the study of holographic superconductors @xcite that , a phase transition is present at a critical value for the chemical potential at @xmath32 for a given temperature .",
    "the phase above @xmath32 is an ads hairy black hole with @xmath4 condensation , which is dual to inflaton dominated phase .",
    "the phase below @xmath32 is ads - schwarzschild black hole with no @xmath4 condensation , thus is dual to the matter dominated phase with a vanishing _",
    "vev _ of the inflaton .",
    "the order of this phase transition depends on the value of @xmath7 which appeared in the last term of the action , and in our case with @xmath33 , the phase transition is of first order .",
    "this implies that the inflaton dominated phase extends to the region below @xmath32 , where the phase becomes metastable .    in the following",
    "we will use such a metastable phase as the initial state of cosmic preheating , which is thermodynamically unstable . as we will see from the analysis",
    ", such an instability can drive the evolution of the background system under consideration from the inflaton - dominant phase towards a phase dominated by the matter field .",
    "in this section , we will focus on the properties of the qnms generated during the initial stage of the background evolution .",
    "the full analysis of the late time evolution should also include the back - reactions , and we would like to address this part in our forthcoming work @xcite .",
    "now we are ready to study the qnms of the metastable phase .",
    "the procedure is standard @xcite ( see also examples for qnms in metastable phase @xcite ) .",
    "first of all , we turn on the following perturbations : @xmath34 the first three modes , which are : @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , can compose of a minimum set for analyzing the dynamical system of the inflaton and matter field .    here",
    "we have chosen the axial gauge : @xmath38 .",
    "it is also possible to eliminate @xmath39 in favor of @xmath40 . without loss of generality",
    ", we include the dependence on @xmath41 in order to study the effect of spatial inhomogeneity , which requires that one to include @xmath42 in the perturbation modes .",
    "it is straightforward to write down the background equations of motion as follows , @xmath43 = 0 ~ , { \\nonumber \\\\ } & \\pd_m ( \\sqrt{-g}f^{mn } ) / \\sqrt{-g } = 2 \\ps^3 ( \\pd^n p - a^n ) ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to derive the perturbation equations .",
    "afterwards , we insert the perturbation modes introduced in eq . into the above equations , and then , perform the fourier transformation by taking the form @xmath44 . as a result ,",
    "we can obtain the perturbation equations list in the following , @xmath45 it is convenient to rewrite the perturbation equations in terms of the dimensionless coordinate @xmath46 defined in eq . .",
    "then , to solve the dynamics of qnms , we impose the ingoing wave condition on the horizon @xmath47 .",
    "this leads to the asymptotic solutions near the horizon as follows , @xmath48 ~ , { \\nonumber \\\\}&\\s = ( 1-z)^{-\\frac{i\\o}{4r_h } } [ \\s_0 + \\s_1(1-z ) + \\cdots ] ~ , { \\nonumber \\\\}&a_t = ( 1-z)^{1-\\frac{i\\o}{4r_h } } [ a_{t0 } + a_{t1}(1-z ) + \\cdots ] ~ , { \\nonumber \\\\}&a_x = ( 1-z)^{-\\frac{i\\o}{4r_h } } [ a_{x0 } + a_{x1}(1-z ) + \\cdots ] ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that , there are only three free parameters in .",
    "we can parameterize the solutions by @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , with the remaining parameters determined from eq . , and",
    "these three parameters can lead to three independent solutions . in the following , we label the corresponding solutions by the subscripts @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , which are given by : @xmath55 respectively .",
    "moreover , there remains a pure gauge solution , which can be generated from the gauge transformation on a trivial solution as follows , @xmath56 and has been labeled by the subscript @xmath57 .",
    "for a generic solution constructed from linear combination of the above four basis solutions , the asymptotic expansions of the qnms near the boundary then take the forms to be @xmath58 the leading coefficients are dual to sources to the corresponding fields on the minkowski boundary .",
    "the conditions of qnms require that the modes live without external sources , and thus , all leading coefficients should vanish .",
    "this can be formulated as the condition on the above basis solutions as follows , @xmath59    note that eq .",
    "is independent of the normalization of solutions , and hence , we can set @xmath60 in the pure gauge solution .",
    "the condition allows us to determine the qnms for a fixed wave number @xmath61 .",
    "the qnms with the positive imaginary part correspond to the existence of an instability for the metastable state , which can be clearly read by inserting this imaginary part into the exponent factor @xmath44 .",

    "this property is very similar to the case of cosmic preheating at weak coupling in which the exponential growth can be realized when the coupling satisfies the requirement of parametric resonance , except that the growth in the strong coupling case is steady continuous without additional requirement on the couplings .",
    "moreover , at the large @xmath61 regime , the oscillations become more and more important to describe the evolutions of these qnms . according to the curve in the lower panel of the figure",

    "<S> in the holographic description of cosmic preheating proposed in an accompanied letter @xcite , the energy transfer between the inflaton and matter field at strong coupling is suggested to be mimicked by superfluid and normal components of a superconductor on friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) boundary in an asymptotically anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetime . in this paper we investigated two aspects of the scenario of holographic preheating that are not included in the accompanied work . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , we study in detail the evolution of the quasi - normal modes ( qnms ) surrounding a metastable hairy black hole . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis can quantitatively describe the preheating process of the matter field that is produced continuously in the case of strong coupling . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , we present a detailed analysis of the holographic renormalization for the ads - frw background , which allows us to extract operator expectation values for studying cosmological implications . </S>"
