    "direct satellite measurements of total solar irradiance @xcite , show that it varies almost in phase with the solar activity cycle , and that its relative variation in amplitude is about 0.1% .",
    "although the most common explanation of this change , involves the effect of magnetic regions and network ( superposed to an otherwise constant solar photosphere ) , an alternative explanation is that the cyclic variation is primarily due to structural changes of the solar interior .",
    "two arguments support this second possibility .",
    "firstly , direct measurements of the spectrum of p - mode oscillations , show variations @xcite that can be best explained in terms of structural changes ( i.e. changes in pressure , density , radius , etc ) @xcite .",
    "secondly , measurements of the `` effective temperature '' by gray and livingston ( 1997b ) , also vary nearly in phase with the solar cycle .",
    "this variation is obtained by monitoring the neutral carbon @xmath8 line in the solar flux spectrum .",
    "they present several arguments supporting their contention that what they measure is the gas temperature in the deep photosphere , free from the influence of sunspots , faculae and small scale magnetic flux tubes .",
    "their main argument rests on their simultaneous monitoring of c i @xmath8 , fe i @xmath9 and ti ii @xmath10 .",
    "they use the ratios of spectral line depths , c i @xmath8 to fe i @xmath9 and to ti ii @xmath10 , as temperature indicators . since these three lines have different excitation potentials ( @xmath11 ev for ti ii @xmath10 , @xmath12 ev for fe i @xmath9 , and @xmath13 ev for c i @xmath8 )",
    ", the consistency of the results for the two line depth ratios , shows that the temperature indicators are free from the influence of variations of faculae and small scale magnetic flux tubes , which would be expected to affect each line in a different way .",
    "see gray &  livinston ( 1997a , b ) for the entire discussion . in order for the gas temperature to change , the energy flow from the interior must also change .",
    "structural adjustment will be able to accomplish this .",
    "since the relative radius variation @xmath14 is very small @xcite , @xmath15 where @xmath5 and @xmath16 are luminosity and temperature , respectively .",
    "the temperature change measured by gray and livingston ( 1997 ) is @xmath17 k in one cycle , which corresponds to @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "this is approximately the entire cyclic variation of the total irradiance .",
    "= 5.5 cm    the most obvious way the solar structure may change , is in response to variations of the internal magnetic field during the dynamo build - up and decay . in order to compute this effect ,",
    "we introduce magnetic variables as new stellar structure variables @xcite , in addition to the conventional ones @xcite .",
    "since magnetic field is not a scalar , we have to use at least two variables to describe it : the magnetic energy density @xmath20 @xcite , and the ratio of the magnetic pressure to the magnetic energy , @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "this method was developed by lydon and sofia in 1995 , in which @xmath22 was treated as a parameter , and it was subsequently applied by lydon , guenther and sofia ( 1996 ) , to explain the observed variation of solar p - mode oscillations with the solar cycle @xcite .",
    "here we want to update this method by : ( i ) treating both @xmath20 and @xmath22 as new structure variables , as done for @xmath20 in lydon and sofia ( 1995 ) , ( ii ) taking into account the influence of magnetic fields on radiative opacities , ( iii ) taking into account all time - dependent contributions to the equations of stellar structure ( since we want to treat short time scales ) , ( iv ) modifying the radiative loss assumption of a convective element ( as discussed in section 3 ) , ( v ) updating the code by using the new version of yale stellar evolution code ( yrec7 ) and ( vi ) removing the perfect gas approximation , which was assumed when calculating some first- and second - order derivatives associated with magnetic fields in lydon and sofia ( 1995 ) . because luminosity , radius and temperature variations are sensitive to the location , intensity , orientation , and distribution of the perturbation magnetic field @xmath23 ( @xmath24 is the gas density ) , we can use the measured yearly - averaged irradiance , temperature and radius variations , to determine the solar interior magnetic field as a function of mass and time .",
    "space - based solar irradiance measurements have been reviewed by frhlich and lean ( 1998 ) , and a composite solar irradiance record for the period from 1978 to the present can be downloaded from the website http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/. in our magnetic perturbation model calculations , we use one year as the timestep , since variations on the shorter time scales may be attributed to the effect of magnetic regions and network .",
    "we compare the results with the yearly means of total solar irradiance , as shown in figure  [ lifig1 ] .",
    "the standard variances range from 0.1 wm@xmath25 to 0.5 wm@xmath25 .",
    "the spectroscopic temperature variations of the sun , measured by gray and livingston ( 1997 ) over the period from 1978 to 1992 , are shown in figure  [ lifig2 ] ( reproduced from their figure 9 ) .",
    "the points are the yearly means , the zero point being chosen arbitrarily .",
    "standard solar models ( ssm ) use pressure , temperature , radius and luminosity as the structure variables , and mass @xmath26 interior to a radius @xmath27 , as the independent variable . in order to self",
    "- consistently take into account magnetic effects , lydon and sofia ( 1995 ) introduced two new magnetic structure variables to model the sun : the magnetic energy per unit mass @xmath20 , and the effective ratio of specific heats for the magnetic perturbation , @xmath22 .",
    "the former describes the magnetic perturbation strength , and the latter describes the tensor feature of the magnetic pressure . in general , the determination of @xmath20 and @xmath22 requires a comprehensive understanding of turbulent dynamics in the solar convective zone @xcite , an undertaking that is impractical at present",
    ". therefore we take @xmath20 and @xmath22 as free parameters ( functions ) that need to be determined at this stage , instead of using dynamo equations to determine them .",
    "our aim is to use the measured solar irradiance and effective temperature variations given in figures  [ lifig1 ] and [ lifig2 ] to determine @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are mass depth and time , respectively . using @xmath28",
    ", we can obtain the solar interior magnetic field @xmath32 .",
    "since these observations are not enough to determine the two new variables uniquely , we assume they have a gaussian - like shape , and also utilize helioseismic ( @xcite ) and radius ( @xcite ) observations , as additional constraints . the mass depth @xmath30 is defined as @xmath33 this replaces the mass variable @xmath26 when we want to describe the location , orientation and form of all magnetic perturbations .    for our purpose we can use the toroidal ( @xmath34 ) and poloidal ( @xmath35 ) components to express a magnetic field vector @xmath36 .",
    "the magnetic energy density variable @xmath20 can be written as , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the magnitude of the magnetic field vector .",
    "the magnetic field direction variable @xmath22 can be written as , @xmath39 the magnetic pressure @xmath40 can be defined in terms of the new magnetic variables as @xmath41 the value of @xmath22 depends on the field geometry .",
    "parallel to the field lines , @xmath42 is zero , so @xmath43 , whereas perpendicular to the field lines , @xmath42 is a maximum , so @xmath44 .",
    "the continuity equation remains the same .",
    "the hydrostatic equation is replaced by the equation of motion , which including the lorentz force , is @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the radial component is @xmath47 the magnetic field has both a magnetic tension and a magnetic pressure .",
    "this can be seen by writing the lorentz force @xmath48 , as the sum of the magnetic tension @xmath49 and the magnetic pressure @xmath50 .",
    "the former is anisotropic , and the latter is isotropic .",
    "both contribute to the last term of the radial motion equation , and are incorporated into @xmath40 .",
    "for example , for a purely radial magnetic field , the magnetic tension force , @xmath51 , which cancels the magnetic pressure force . as a result ,",
    "@xmath52 in this case .",
    "defining @xmath53 as the total pressure , the equation of radial motion becomes @xmath54 where the last term represents the inertial force . since @xmath55 the equation of state becomes @xmath56 where @xmath57 since we use the one - dimensional stellar evolution model , we can not model the transverse component of the equation of motion . in order to handle this transverse component , we need at least a two - dimensional stellar evolution model .",
    "since such a model is not available yet , we only consider the radial motion equation in this paper .",

    "@xmath62 is the specific heat at constant pressure .",
    "if @xmath22 is constant , then @xmath63 , and equation  ( [ firstlaw ] ) reduces to equation  ( 75 ) in lydon &  sofia ( 1995 ) .",
    "the symbol @xmath64 , is the radiation energy density , where @xmath65 is the radiation constant .",
    "@xmath66 appears in the full energy conservation equation , @xmath67 @xmath68 is the radiation energy flux vector , and @xmath69 is the photon diffusion velocity .",
    "the equation of transport of energy by radiation , @xmath70 does not change in form , but the magnetic field affects the opacity coefficient @xmath71 . here",
    "@xmath72 is the speed of light .",
    "see appendix [ appa ] for an estimate of this effect .",
    "the equation of energy transport by convection , @xmath73 does not change form either , but the convection temperature gradient , @xmath74 , with a magnetic field , is different from that without it . lydon and sofia ( 1995 ) have demonstrated how to account for magnetic effects in the mixing length theory , and hence obtain @xmath74 , provided @xmath22 is constant .",
    "their method can also be used to derive @xmath74 when @xmath22 is variable , as we are about to do in this paper . see appendix  [ appb ] for the concrete expression for @xmath74 in our case .",
    "the stellar evolution code solves the stellar structure equations ( such as eqs .",

    "such a small timestep requires a very precise code .",
    "for example , because @xmath77 has increased by about @xmath78 during the lifetime of the sun , the relative mean rate of change is about @xmath79 per year .",
    "to achieve such a high precision is a challenge .",
    "fortunately , yale stellar evolution code ( yrec ) meets this need , as shown before , @xcite .",
    "we follow lydon and sofia ( 1995 ) by modifying yrec7 , a new version released in may 1999 , in order to accommodate the magnetic effects described above .",
    "the reason why yrec permits a small timestep and achieves such a high numerical precision , is because it uses analytical formulae ( prather 1976 ) , rather than numerical methods , to solve the linearized stellar structure equations .    in order to accommodate the various magnetic effects described above , we must first write a routine to specify @xmath20 and @xmath22 .",
    "we assume @xmath80 .",
    "the maximum magnetic energy density @xmath81 , is to be determined from solar activity indices .",
    "the yearly - averaged sunspot number , @xmath82 , is the most widely used solar activity index . from numerical experiments ,",
    "we find that the results are sensitive to the function form of @xmath83 on @xmath84 .",

    "the reason why such a functional form of @xmath83 is chosen is that @xmath87 kg , at a depth of @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) in 1996 .",
    "this result is inferred from helioseismology @xcite when @xmath82 was at a minimum .",
    "using this prescription for @xmath83 , the value of @xmath83 is about twice as large at the maximum of solar cycle , as it is at the minimum .",
    "@xmath90 specifies the distribution of @xmath20 , and is to be determined by fitting the measured irradiance and effective temperature variations .",
    "@xmath90 has infinite degrees of freedom and thus can not be determined uniquely by observational results , which have finite degrees of freedom .",
    "however , we can remove this degeneracy by assuming a field shape of the form , @xmath91 , \\label{gauss}\\ ] ] where @xmath92 specifies the location and @xmath93 specifies its width .",
    "this gaussian profile allows us to pinpoint the location of the required magnetic field , by using observations of cyclic variations of irradiance and effective temperature .",
    "we either fix @xmath22 , or use @xmath94 to express the spatial and temporal variations of the direction of magnetic fields .",
    "this implies that the more intense the magnetic field , the larger its toroidal component .",
    "the profile of @xmath22 is arbitrary , but its value must lie between 1 and 2 .",
    "although the detailed results are sensitive to the functional form of @xmath22 , the qualitative features are same .",
    "we find that the magnetic effects are maximized when @xmath44 , so we set @xmath44 in subsequent computations .",
    "the main effect of a smaller @xmath22 , is to increase the magnetic field required to reproduce the observed variation of the sun .    as the magnetic fields that cause the solar activity cycle",
    "are believed to exist outside of the solar core ( where the thermonuclear reactions occur ) , we do not consider the influence of magnetic fields on the energy generation rate .",
    "magnetic fields affect the equation of state in the following way .",
    "if @xmath95 , the ratio of the gas pressure to the total pressure when magnetic fields are present , is defined as @xmath96 ( @xmath65 is the radiation constant ) , then the density of a gas can be determined from @xmath97 @xmath98 is the gas constant , @xmath99 is the number of free electrons per nucleus ( determined by solving the saha equation ) and @xmath100 is the mean atomic weight per atom ( prather 1976 ) .",
    "note , @xmath99 also depends on @xmath95 . in the stardard case , since @xmath101 , @xmath95 does not depend on @xmath24 .",
    "but in the nonstandard case discussed in this paper , @xmath95 depends on @xmath24 . consequently , not only @xmath24 , but also its first derivatives @xmath102",
    ", @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 , and its second derivatives with respect to @xmath16 and @xmath76 , all need to be calculated by iteration ( which is tedious ) . in the original implementation of this method by lydon and sofia ( 1995 ) .",
    "the second derivatives were approximated by assuming a perfect gas , which needs no iteration . in this",
    "code upgrade , we modify the equation of state routine so that we can accurately calculate all these thermodynamic variables by iteration .",
    "although this improves the numerical precision , it does not make any qualitative difference .",
    "@xmath106 and @xmath107 ( defined in appendix  [ appb ] ) are also calculated by numerical derivatives , as are those time derivatives which appear in the equations of stellar structure .",
    "the qualitative difference comes from @xmath108 ( see appendix [ appb ] ) , which represents the influence of magnetic field on radiative loss of a convection element .",

    "when @xmath111 and @xmath22 is fixed , equation  ( [ am1 ] ) reduces to @xmath112 however , under those assumptions , the calculated cyclic variation of effective temperature is in antiphase with the solar activity , contrary to the observations @xcite . in order to get a proper fit to the observations ,",
    "it is necessary to assume @xmath113 , a value that will be used in all our subsequent calculations .",
    "we use eq .",
    "( [ kappap ] ) to compute the global magnetic effect on the radiative opacity , and find that this has little influence on the effective temperature . on the other hand",
    ", the need of @xmath113 implies that the energy loss of a convective element due to turbulence associated with the local magnetic field , is much more efficient than the radiative loss enhancement of the convective element due to the global magnetic field .",
    "= 5.5 cm    we do not redistribute the mass grid points , nor do we predict stellar structure variables for the next time step , when the timestep is smaller than a solar cycle period , since these operations will generate an error much larger than @xmath79 per year for luminosity . all convergence criteria for iteration",
    "are tightened by requiring the relative error to be no larger than @xmath114 or so . in this modified code ,",
    "the matching point is at @xmath115 .",
    "the conventional model parameters are , the mixing length parameter ( the ratio of the mixing length to the pressure scale height , usually denoted as @xmath102 parameter ) , the initial hellium mass abundance ( @xmath116 ) , and the initial heavy element mass abundance ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "the magnetic parameters introduced in this paper are the peak mass depth @xmath92 of the magnetic energy density @xmath20 , the width of @xmath20 ( i.e.,@xmath93 ) , the magnetic strength parameter @xmath86 , and the turbulent loss parameter of energy of a convective element @xmath108 .",
    "it is well known that the conventional parameters can be determined by present observations of solar radius and luminosity . through numerical experiments ( i.e. , model calculations ) , we find that the magnetic parameters ( @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath86 and @xmath108 ) , can be determined by the observed cyclic variation of solar radius , luminosity and effective temperature .",
    "we fix @xmath113 in all subsequent runs , as required by the observed variation of effective temperature .",
    "@xmath44 is fixed to maximize the magnetic effects . in order to probe the observation - required location , strength and profile of the solar interior magnetic field , we change @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath86 from run to run .",
    "at present , it is generally believed that the magnetic field is stored only in the subadiabatically stratified overshoot layer in the form of flux tubes , which may break loose due to kink instabilities , when a threshold of @xmath118 gauss is exceeded @xcite .",
    "figure  [ lifig3 ] depicts @xmath119 vs @xmath30 , in which the subadiabatically stratified overshoot layer approximately corresponds to the mass depth range : @xmath120 .",
    "@xmath121 marks the base of the convection zone of our model sun .",
    "therefore , the maximum yearly - averaged field strength @xmath83 in the overshoot layer during the solar cycle should be smaller than the threshold .",
    "the field with @xmath122 and @xmath123 , can be considered to be confined in the overshoot layer . however , even if the threshold value of b is used , the resultant irradiance and effective temperature variations are negligible",
    ".    only when we abandon this threshold constraint ( e.g. , using a field larger than @xmath124 gauss ) , can we get irradiance variations comparable to the observations , in magnitude and phase ; however , even then , the effective temperature variation is much smaller and in antiphase with the solar cycle . besides , the resulting relative radius variation is larger than @xmath125 . since the observations reveal that both irradiance and effective temperature variations are in phase with the solar cycle , and the relative radius variation should be much smaller than @xmath126 @xcite , we conclude that the magnetic field that gives rise to the observed variations of irradiance and effective temperature ( shown in figures  [ lifig1 ] and [ lifig2 ] ) can not be completely confined in the overshoot layer .",
    "the above arguments lead us to investigate the possibility that the magnetic field is located totally within the convection zone .",

    "we find that the lower part of the convection zone , @xmath128 , is ruled out because it produces radius changes that are too large ( @xmath129 ) and/or because it requires a too strong magnetic field ( @xmath130 g ) .",
    "for the next region up , @xmath131 , or @xmath132 , we find that our model can reproduce the observed cyclic variations of irradiance and effective temperature by using a possible equipartition magnetic field , @xmath133 g. in this case , the amplitude of the radius changes is from 17 to 3 km , and @xmath134 ranges from 0.02 to 0.006 .    in order to pinpoint the location of the required magnetic fields in the allowed region of solar convection zone ( @xmath135 $ ] ) ,",
    "we need more information .",
    "we obtain the allowed region by using the observational information for solar irradiance and effective temperature cyclic variations , and by assuming the corresponding solar radius variation @xmath14 to be much smaller than @xmath126 .",

    "= 5.5 cm    although we can relate the magnetic field generation to the plasma turbulence in this region , the magnetic field maintenance here faces the old problem of magnetic buoyancy .",
    "how can we get around this problem ?",
    "observations and simulations suggest that the actual dynamics within solar convection zone is extremely intricate @xcite .",
    "the velocities and magnetic fields are complex , exhibiting large - scale structure and ordered behavior amidst rapidly varying and intense small - scale turbulence .",
    "in fact , the numerical simulations of the solar outer convection zone @xcite indicate a major presence of downward moving plumes . these ordered downdrafts may gather small magnetic flux tubes , generated in the extremely unstable layer , to form larger flux tubes and carry them to the deeper layer .",
    "these downdrafts may also push down the magnetic flux tubes to balance the magnetic buoyancy to form a magnetized layer below the most unstable convective region .",
    "one possibility is that the downdrafts gather and carry magnetic flux tubes , generated by turbulence , to depths in the convective envelope until some sort of equipartition is reached .",
    "in fact , antia , chitre , and thompson ( 2000 ) have explored this possibility .",
    "they employ the observed splittings of solar oscillation frequencies to separate the effects of interior solar rotation , and to estimate the contribution from a large - scale magnetic field . after subtracting out the estimated contribution from rotation",
    ", there is some residual signal in the even splitting coefficients .",
    "this may be explained by a magnetic field of approximately 20 kg strength located at a depth of @xmath146 ( @xmath89 ) in 1996 . since the density near @xmath146 , is of order @xmath145 , and",
    "the downward velocity for the plumes is of order @xmath147 cm s@xmath148 , the estimated dynamical pressure of the plumes , @xmath149 , is equal to or larger then @xmath150 dyne cm@xmath25 .",
    "the size of @xmath149 is comparable with the magnetic pressure , @xmath152 , corresponding to a field strength of @xmath153 kg .",
    "this demonstrates that a stable magnetized layer in the convection zone proper , may form when the complexity of convection motion is taken into account .",
    "if we wish to reproduce the observed temperature and irradiance variations by the magnetic field at the depth indicated by helioseismology , we find that @xmath83 ranges from 20 kg to 47 kg during a solar cycle ( choosing @xmath154 g ) .",
    "therefore , in figures  [ lifig5]-[lifig8 ] we also show this case ( dotted curves : @xmath155 , @xmath127 ) . the irradiance fit ( @xmath156 ) is also better than the effective temperature fit ( @xmath157 ) , the @xmath2 parameter is equal to about @xmath158 , and the predicted cyclic variation of solar radius is equal to about @xmath159 , which can be tested by measuring the @xmath2 parameter .",
    "in fact , using mdi / soho data obtained between april 19 , 1996 and june 24 , 1998 , emilio et al ( 2000 ) found @xmath160 , which is consistent with the above prediction .",
    "this shows that the second case is in agreement with all relevant precise observations , including solar irradiance , effective temperature , radius , and p - mode oscillation observations .",
    "the first case is ruled out by the @xmath2 parameter inferred from the observation .",
    "the upper part of the convection zone , @xmath161 , is ruled out because the resulting irradiance and effective temperature variations are in antiphase with the solar cycle , which is in conflict with the observations .    in all cases , to produce the observed luminosity and effective temperature variations , the required magnetic field must increase with depth .",
    "the resulting @xmath2 parameter also increases with depth .",
    "this is in agreement with the early studies @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that these magnetic flux tubes are carried downwards into the stable subadiabatically stratified overshoot layer , to provide a seed field for the dynamo operating at the base of the convection zone .",

    "<S> we argue that a variety of solar data suggest that the activity - cycle timescale variability of the total irradiance , is produced by structural adjustments of the solar interior . assuming these adjustments are induced by variations of internal magnetic fields , we use measurements of the total irradiance and effective temperature over the period from 1978 to 1992 , to infer the magnitude and location of the magnetic field . using an updated stellar evolution model , which includes magnetic fields , we find that the observations can be explained by fields whose peak values range from 120k to 2.3k gauss , located in the convection zone between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding maximal radius changes , are 17 km when the magnetic field is located at @xmath0 and 3 km when it is located at @xmath1 . at these depths , the @xmath2 parameter ( defined by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the radius and luminosity ) ranges from @xmath6 to @xmath7 . </S>",
