    "particularly remarkable is the prominent jet extending from the nucleus , visible throughout the electromagnetic spectrum .",

    "compared to the available information at these wavelengths , our knowledge of m87 at far - infrared ( fir ) wavelengths is rather poor .",
    "a controversial issue is the origin of the fir emission in m87 , i.e. , the question of whether the fir emission is caused entirely by synchrotron emission or whether there is an additional contribution from dust associated with either the global interstellar medium or a nuclear dust component .",
    "several papers , based on iras , iso and spitzer observations , arrive at different conclusions @xcite .    , beam sizes are indicated in the bottom right corner .",

    "hevics is an approved open time key program , which has been awarded 286  h of observing time in parallel mode with the pacs and spire instruments .",
    "we will ultimately map four @xmath2 square degree regions of the cluster at 100 , 160 , 250 , 350 and 500  @xmath3 m , down to the 250  @xmath3 m confusion limit of about 1  mjy  sr@xmath4 .",
    "the hevics sdp observations consisted of a single cross - scan of one @xmath2  deg@xmath5 field at the centre of the virgo cluster .",
    "while these sdp observations comprise only 6% of the total hevics observations , the analysis based on these observations already gives a prelude to the primary hevics science goals including the effects of the environment on the dust medium of galaxies , the fir luminosity function , the complete seds of galaxies and a detailed analysis of the dust content of dwarf and early - type galaxies .",
    "the observations also enabled us to study the intensity and nature of the fir emission of m87 .",
    "the left part of figure  [ rawdata.pdf ] shows the pacs and spire images of the central @xmath6 region of m87 , which is clearly detected in all five bands .",
    "the top right panel in figure  [ rawdata.pdf ] shows the integrated sed in the infrared - submm - radio region between 15  @xmath3 m and 100  cm , with the new herschel data as well as isocam , iras , mips , and scuba , gbt , wmap , and vla data gathered from the literature @xcite ; the actual flux densities can be found in .",
    "the solid line is the best - fit power law for all literature data and has a slope @xmath7 ; the dotted line fits only the submm and radio data and has a slope @xmath8 .",
    "the bottom right panel in figure  [ rawdata.pdf ] shows the residual from the best - fit power law in the infrared - submm wavelength region ; clearly , the integrated herschel fluxes are in full agreement with synchrotron radiation .",
    "the cyan line in this figure is a modified black - body fitted with @xmath0  k and @xmath1 .",
    "this temperature is the mean dust equilibrium temperature in the interstellar radiation field of m87 , determined using the skirt radiative transfer code @xcite and based on the photometry from @xcite .",
    "the dust mass was adjusted to fit the upper limits of the residuals .",
    "it is clear that the sed of m87 is incompatible with dust masses higher than @xmath9 .",
    "m. the left panel shows the synchrotron image at the model resolution , the central panel shows the same model convolved to the spire 250  @xmath3 m beam and pixel size .",
    "the right panel shows the observed spire 250  @xmath3 m image . in all panels ,",
    "the green lines are the contours of the synchrotron model at the model resolution . ]",
    "although indicative , the analysis of the integrated sed does not definitively identify the origin of the fir emission in m87 .",
    "approximating the global sed as a single power - law synchrotron model is indeed an oversimplification of the complicated structure of m87 .",
    "several studies have shown that m87 contains three distinct regions of significant synchrotron emission , each with their own spectral indices : the nucleus , the jet and associated lobes in the nw region , and the se lobes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have constructed a synchrotron model for the central regions of m87 , based on a newly reduced mips 24  @xmath3 m map and archival mustang 90  ghz and 15 , 8.2 , 4.9 , 1.6 , and 0.3  ghz maps @xcite .",
    "we fitted a second - order polynomial synchrotron model to each pixel of the mips + radio data cube and used this synchrotron model to predict the emission of m87 at 250  @xmath3 m ( the spire 250  @xmath3 m image provides the optimal compromise between s / n and spatial resolution ) .",
    "figure  [ h250.pdf ] shows the comparison between the synchrotron model prediction at 250  @xmath3 m and the spire observations . at the model resolution",
    ", the three distinct components are visible , but when we convolve this synchrotron model image with the spire 250  @xmath3 m beam , the three different components merge into a single extended structure with one elongated peak slightly west of the nucleus . comparing the central and right panels of figure  [ h250.pdf ]",
    ", we see that the synchrotron model is capable of explaining the observed spire 250  @xmath3 m image satisfactorily .",
    "we conclude that for both the integrated sed and the spire 250  @xmath3 m map , we have found that synchrotron emission is an adequate explanation of the fir emission .",
    "we do not detect a fir excess that can not be explained by the synchrotron model .",
    "in particular , we have no reason to invoke the presence of smooth dust emission associated with the galaxy interstellar medium , as advocated by @xcite . for a dust temperature of 23  k , which is the expected equilibrium temperature in the interstellar radiation field of m87",
    ", we find an upper limit to the dust mass of @xmath10 .",
    "our conclusion is that , seen from the fir point of view , m87 is a passive object with a central radio source emitting synchrotron emission , without a substantial diffuse dust component ."
