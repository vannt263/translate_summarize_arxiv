    "however , because of the wide range of scales and of physical processes involved , considering both aspects simultaneously can be challenging .",

    "the accretion event is often modelled by replacing one galactic potential with another , both static @xcite .",
    "the galactic potential is evolved using a separate galaxy simulation to allow for time - evolving , non - analytical potentials and include effects like galaxy mergers @xcite or even complex tidal histories in cosmological context @xcite .",
    "although the last approach provides a relatively high level of realism , it does not allow us to distinguish the relative role of the numerous physical processes involved in the evolution of the clusters . in this paper",

    "the full story of the co - evolution of star clusters and their hosts would be told by considering a combination of this particular effect , and the other mechanisms driving galaxy evolution , like minor and major mergers , and the accretion of gas . in that respect",
    ", cosmological simulations and merger trees would serve as a base to establish the relative weight and frequency of these events , and to allow us to build the true tidal history of clusters , in future studies .    here , we follow the evolution of clusters in a time - dependent galactic potential , and compare to that in static potentials , to quantify the role of secular galaxy evolution on the present - day properties of star clusters .",
    "our method is two - fold : ( _ i _ ) an exploration of the parameter space performed with very fast codes , but at the price of some simplifications , and ( _ ii _ ) several much slower but more accurate @xmath0-body simulations using the relevant sets of parameters identified in the first step .",
    "for simplicity and to limit degeneracy in the results , we only consider the halo component of the galaxy and opt for a self - similar growth .",

    "we then `` freeze '' the potential , and perform a backward integration of the cluster orbit .",
    "this gives us the initial position and velocity of the cluster for the s0 run .",

    ", we always initially set the cluster at apocenter , with a purely tangential velocity , in our s5 and td cases .",
    "orbit integration is performed using the ` nbody6tt`method @xcite , either to integrate the motion of the cluster ( section  [ sec : paramspace ] ) , or in the full @xmath0-body context where the cluster is described star - by - star ( section  [ sec : nbody ] ) .",
    "we considered several intrinsic and orbital initial conditions for the clusters . unless otherwise mentioned , our clusters are modeled with 32768 stars distributed on a plummer sphere with a virial radius of @xmath27 ( i.e. a half - mass radius of @xmath28 ) .",
    "the masses of the stars follow a @xcite initial mass function , from 0.1 to @xmath29 , leading to a total initial mass of @xmath30 .",

    "we aim to determine if , under which conditions and to what extend , the evolution of a cluster in a cosmologically growing potential ( td ) differs from that of the same cluster in a static @xmath18 version of this potential ( s0 ) .",
    "this difference relies on ( _ i _ ) the strength of the tidal field and ( _ ii _ ) how sensitive the cluster is to tides .",

    "this quantity represents the galactic effect along the galaxy - cluster axis , and can be used to estimate the tidal radius ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "we show an example of evolution of the effective eigenvalue in fig .",
    "[ fig : orbit ] , together with the galactocentric radius and the galactic mass enclosed in this radius , for the three orbits ( td , s5 and s0 ) .",
    "as constructed , the td case evolves from the s5 to the s0 setup . on average , despite of a smaller orbital radius , the mass enclosed within the galactocentric radius in s0 is larger than that in s5 , because the s0 galaxy yields a higher total mass .",
    "we estimate the mean tidal strength over an orbit by computing the time - average @xmath32 of the main effective eigenvalue over an orbital period ( dashed lines on fig .",
    "[ fig : orbit ] ) .",
    "this quantity is constant in static potentials .",
    "the larger enclosed mass and smaller galactocentric distance result in a stronger tidal effect along the s0 orbit than in the s5 case .",
    "the secular cosmological galactic growth can only affect the evolution of star clusters if the tidal effects in the s5 and s0 case are significantly different , or in other words , if the ratio @xmath33 is large with respect to unity .",
    "this ratio depends on the initial position and velocity of the cluster in a non - trivial way . by varying the initial galactocentric radius and orbital eccentricity of the cluster for the s5 orbit and integrating it numerically",
    ", we obtain the map of the ratio of tidal strengths shown in fig .",

    "the difference between tidal strengths is maximal for circular orbits in the outer region of the halo . ]    the largest differences between the tidal fields of the redshift 5 and 0 galaxies are found in the outer regions of the galactic halo , and for circular orbits . secular galactic growth induces the largest differences in the outer regions of galactic halos and thus , the largest differences in tides are found along orbits that remain in such regions for the largest fraction of their period .",
    "however , at large galactocentric distance , tidal forces are weak and only have a mild impact on the evolution of clusters .",
    "the differences found between the s5 and s0 cases might thus not translate into differences in the properties of the clusters .    to summarise",
    ", we have identified the orbits favouring the largest differences in tides between high and low redshift , but the resistance of clusters to tidal harassment must also be considered before concluding on the effect of secular galactic growth on star clusters .",
    "we have seen in the previous section that the average strength of the tidal field experienced by a cluster could increase by a factor of a few because of the secular cosmological growth of the galaxy .",
    "we focus here on star cluster responses to such differences .",
    "one of the most accurate manner to study star cluster evolution is through @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "these are however very numerically costly and such approach forbids an exploration of a wide parameter space . at first order however , cluster evolution relies on an handful of coupled differential equations ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "doing this allows us to set the same tidal radii in ` emacss`than the time - average ones measured in the previous section .",

    "the horizontal ridge visible in this plot is an effect of clusters reaching the core - collapse phase shortly before the end of the simulation ( @xmath34 ) .",

    "* for details ) .",
    "]    to extend this conclusion , we apply the same method to clusters with different sensitivity to tides by varying the initial half - mass radius and thus , indirectly , the roche - filling factor ( the ratio between the cluster half - mass radius and the tidal radius ) .",

    "[ fig : filling ] the ratios of the final masses ( as in fig .",

    "[ fig : finalmass ] . in all cases",
    "explored , the properties of the cluster ( mass , size ) along the s5 orbit lie within less than a few percent from those along the s0 orbit .    because the td case represents a slow and smooth transition between s5 and s0 , the differences between the latter can be seen as an upper limit of the expected differences between the time - dependent ( td ) and static ( s0 ) cases .",
    "since this upper limit is very small , we expect clusters with a time - dependent tidal history to share very similar properties as those in static potentials .",
    "in other words , cluster evolution should be fairly independent of the evolution of its host galaxy ( for the secular growth considered here ) .",
    "when performing the exploration of the parameter space described in the previous section , we made the assumption that the time - average tidal strength can be used to infer the galactic influence on star clusters . while this is perfectly valid for circular orbits , it is not for eccentric cases @xcite .",
    "an analytical description of tidal effects for non - circular orbit is yet to be established .",
    "furthermore , we have neglected the second order effect of the detailed shape of the tidal field when assuming the tidal radius is a good representation of the tidal strength .    to test these assumptions and validate our conclusions , we select a few cases from our parameter space study , and perform full @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "we use the method and implementation ` nbody6tt`presented in @xcite , based on ` nbody6`@xcite .",

    "using this definition , the code integrates the motion of the cluster around the galaxy , and adds tidal acceleration to the internal acceleration for all stars .",
    "we have defined the galactic potentials and their time - dependence exactly as describe in section  [ sec : potential ] and performed several sets of s5 , td and s0 runs .      , computed with ` nbody6tt ` . only stars with a negative energy ( kinetic + potential from other cluster members )",

    "since the formation of the disc @xcite ) makes our results directly applicable to clusters formed _ in - situ_. studies of such clusters can thus safely make the assumption that the galactic potential has been static over several gyr , without biasing the conclusions on the mass- and size - functions of the clusters .",
