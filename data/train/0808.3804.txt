    "tracking with the cms detector is done using silicon sensors only .",
    "the two major components of the tracking system  @xcite are the silicon micro - strip detector and the silicon pixel detector .",
    "the micro - strip detector consists of barrels and end - caps and ensures coverage up to 1.2 m radially and 2.7 m from the primary interaction point along the beam line .",
    "the pixel detector is the component closest to the beam line and consists of three 0.5 m long barrel layers at radii of 4.3 , 7.2 and 11 cm and two end - cap disks at each end - side of the barrels located at 32.5 and 48.5 cm from the interaction point .",
    "overall , the pixel detector provides 3 hit coverage up to pseudo - rapidity @xmath0 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : pixel_det ] both barrel and end - cap pixel detectors consist of planar detector modules mounted either on the outside radius of the support structure ( un - flipped modules ) or the inside radius of the support structure ( flipped modules ) .",
    "each silicon pixel , 150@xmath1 m long , 100@xmath1 m wide and 300@xmath1 m in depth is bump - bonded to a read - out chip .    .",
    "charge deposition in each pixel is shown in thousands of electrons .",
    "numbers shown in green correspond to charge depositions below the 2000 electron threshold which are not included in the cluster . the dotted red line indicates the particle trajectory projection in the module plane and the red cross shows the true hit position . ,",

    "numbers shown in green correspond to charge depositions below the 2000 electron threshold which are not included in the cluster . the dotted red line indicates the particle trajectory projection in the module plane and the red cross shows the true hit position . ,",
    "title=\"fig:\",width=340 ]    the purpose of the tracking system is to determine the trajectories and momenta of charged particles produced in proton - proton collisions . in particular ,",
    "the pixel detector is crucial for precise measurements of impact parameter and decay length of long lived particles like b mesons .",
    "signatures of top quark , higgs boson and super - symmetric particles include the presence of b mesons , so their identification based on large impact parameter or displaced decay vertex is very important . as charged particles pass through the silicon layers , they ionize the medium and the charge",
    "is collected by the read - out chips . in general , the charge produced by a charged particle is shared by more than one pixel forming pixel clusters as seen in figure  [ fig : pixel_det ] . as shown in figure  [ fig : sensors ] , charge sharing can be due to either the particle track making a small angle with the silicon sensor or because of the charge drifting in the 4  tesla magnetic field in which the tracking system is immersed . before irradiation , the charge sharing is uniform in local x and y directions .",
    "even so , the reconstruction of true hit position is not trivial . as seen in figure  [ fig : pixel_det ] , due to lorentz drift and threshold effects",
    ", the true hit position can be outside the observed cluster .",
    "moreover , as the detector is irradiated , the defects developed in the silicon lattice act as charge traps so that the free charge can only partially reach the readout chips as schematically shown in figure  [ fig : sensors ] .",
    "consequently , the pixel clusters become smaller , asymmetrically .",
    "we present a new technique  @xcite for pixel hit reconstruction with the cms pixel detector .",
    "the technique is based on fitting the pixel cluster x and y projections ( see figure  [ fig : pixel_det ] ) to pre - determined cluster shapes called templates .",
    "a cluster template object is a map of expected charge depositions for given incidence angles @xmath2 and @xmath3 defined as in figure  [ fig : sensors ] .",
    "a detailed simulation program called pixelav  @xcite is used to generate the expected cluster shapes for all possible track incidence angles @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the cluster template technique was originally developed to optimally estimate pixel hit position after radiation damage , but it was found that it performs better than standard cms pixel hit reconstruction  @xcite even before irradiation .",
    "this new technique requires knowledge of the track direction , so it is suitable for use in the second pass of pixel hit reconstruction , when track incidence angles on detector modules are known .",
    "in the first pass of the reconstruction the standard technique  @xcite is used .",
    "given a track with angles @xmath2 and @xmath3 incident to the pixel module , the pre - determined cluster template is compared to the actual cluster produced by the track in question . a @xmath5 minimization is performed with hit x and y positions as floating variables .",
    "the hit position is given by the x and y coordinates which minimize the @xmath5 comparison .",
    "the template reconstruction algorithm improves the pixel hit resolution for un - irradiated sensors as shown in figure  [ fig : performance_no_irrad ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : performance_irrad ] shows the impressive improvement in resolution after irradiation . before irradiation , the improvement of the new reconstruction technique is obvious mainly for clusters with total charge larger than the average charge .",
    "such clusters are affected by delta - rays which are accounted for in detail by the pixelav simulation  @xcite resulting in superior performance of the template technique . for clusters with charge lower than the average ,",
    "the template and standard reconstruction techniques have similar performance . for tracks perpendicular to the sensor modules with @xmath6 , the y cluster projections consist of single pixels resulting in poor y resolution due to lack of charge sharing .",
    "we observe the best y resolution around @xmath7 where the y cluster projections consist of two pixels and a slight worsening of the resolution with increasing @xmath8 .",
    "the x resolution is significantly improved by the template technique for clusters with charge larger than the average and at large eta .",
    "after irradiation , the old reconstruction algorithm exhibits large biases and resolution degradation due to changes in cluster shape from charge trapping .",
    "the pixelav simulation accounts for changes in cluster shapes due to irradiation and provides cluster templates synchronized to the detector irradiation state . as a result",
    ", the template reconstruction technique provides much better pixel hit resolution after irradiation as seen in figure  [ fig : performance_irrad ] .",
    "the significant improvement of the pixel hit resolution when using the template reconstruction technique leads to improvements of the track parameters , mainly the impact parameter which is crucial for b - tagging .",
    "we study the effect of the template reconstruction on b - tagging and find that the fake b - tags rates are reduced by a factor of 2 - 3 when the impact parameter is used to discriminate between true and fake b - jets .",
    "there are other applications of the pixel template reconstruction .",
    "the minimum @xmath5 value obtained from the @xmath5 minimization when templates are compared to observed clusters can be used to assess the quality of pixel hits .",
    "if the track direction is incompatible with the cluster shape , the @xmath5 probability of the pixel hit is low so the pixel hit can be dropped by the track pattern recognition algorithms resulting in significant improvement of the pattern recognition speed .",
    "another application of the template technique is to re - weight the pixel clusters generated by the standard cms simulation so that they agree with the observed clusters after irradiation .",
    "this way , the cluster simulation can be kept synchronized with the aging detector .",
    "we presented a new technique for pixel hit reconstruction with the cms pixel detector .",
    "the method is based on simulating cluster shapes for all track incidence angles and different irradiation levels of the detector .",
    "the new technique improves significantly the pixel hit resolution , the track parameters and b - tagging fake rates and it has useful applications in tracking pattern recognition algorithms and simulation of the pixel clusters as the detector ages due to irradiation .    9 cms collaboration , cms tracker technical design report , ch .  2 , cern / lhcc 98 - 6 , april 1998 . m. swartz , d. fehling , g. giurgiu , p. maksimovic , v. chiochia , cern - cms - note-2007 - 033 , jul 2007 .",
