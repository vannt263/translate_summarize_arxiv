    "clusters of galaxies ( cg ) contain not only the thermal intracluster medium ( icm ) but also non - thermal high energy particles in intracluster space .",
    "one of their direct evidences is existence of non - thermal synchrotron radio halos and relics , which have been observed since 1970s ( wilson 1970 ; giovannini , tordi , & feretti 1999 ) .",
    "this indicates that there are non - thermal electrons with energy of @xmath3 gev in intracluster space .",
    "although their origin is still not clear , they are probably related with some active phenomena in cg such as cluster mergers , agns , agns jets , and/or star burst in the member galaxies .",
    "therefor , it is crucial to study non - thermal high energy particles in order to investigate active phenomena in cg .",
    "furthermore , such non - thermal electrons and protons possibly have an effect on icm dynamics ( rephaeli & silk 1995 ; inoue & sasaki 2001 ) and sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( blasi , olinto , & stebbins 2000 ; ensslin & kaiser 2000 ) .    on the other hand , non - thermal hard x - ray radiation due to inverse compton scattering ( ics ) of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons by the same electron population is expected from such cg with radio halos and relics ( rephaeli 1979 ) .",
    "there have been many attempts to detect such high energy emission ( e.g. , rephaeli , ulmer , & gruber 1994 ; henriksen 1999 ; valinia et al .",
    "1999 ) . however , because of the dominant thermal x - ray emission from icm , it was very difficult to detect non - thermal hard x - ray radiation .",
    "recently , excess of hard x - ray radiation over thermal emission is detected from coma ( fusco - femiano et al .",
    "1999 ; rephaeli , gruber , & blanco 1999 ) , a2256 ( fusco - femiano et al .",
    "2000 ) , and hcg62 ( fukazawa et al .",
    "2001 ) though their origin is still unclear .",
    "if we assume all hard x - ray radiation is due to ics of cmb , we can estimate intracluster magnetic field strength or its lower limit by comparing hard x - ray flux or its upper limit with synchrotron radio flux , respectively ( e.g. , fusco - femiano et al . 1999 ; henriksen 1999 ; valinia et al . 1999 ) . however , the magnetic field strength estimated through this method tends to be weaker than that determined through faraday rotation measurement ( kim , tribble & kronberg 1991 ; clarke , kronberg , & bhringer 2001 ) .",
    "one possible solution of this discrepancy is that all or a significant part of hard x - ray emission is due to non - thermal bremsstrahlung ( ntb ) from weakly relativistic non - thermal electrons with energy of a few 10 or 100 kev ( e.g. , kaastra et al .",
    "1999 ; ensslin , lieu , & biermann 1999 ; kempner & sarazin 2000 ; dogiel 2000 ; blasi 2000 ) .",
    "however , ntb needs much more non - thermal electron energy than ics to produce a given amount of hard x - ray .",
    "in addition , dominant cooling process of electrons relevant to ntb hard x - ray is not bremsstrahlung losses but coulomb interaction with thermal icm , which results in energy transfer from the non - thermal electrons to the thermal icm .",
    "petrosian ( 2001 ) showed that unusual rapid heating will occur if coma hard x - ray is due to ntb .",
    "however , calculation of ntb spectra is still interesting because it will possibly work well to explain future observations of other clusters . at present ,",
    "hard x - ray excess have been detected from only a few clusters of galaxies .",
    "thus , it is not clear whether coma cluster is a typical case or not .    whether ics or ntb is dominant in hard x - ray depends on a shape of electron momentum spectra .",
    "this depends on acceleration and cooling processes of electrons .",
    "for instance , if turbulent acceleration in icm is an only effective acceleration process , it is difficult to accelerate thermal electrons up to @xmath3gev because the acceleration time is too long for typical intracluster conditions .",
    "therefore , almost hard x - ray is due to ntb ( blasi 2000 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if we consider shock acceleration in icm ( takizawa & naito 2000 ) , it is expected that accelerated electron momentum spectra are power - law up to the critical energy where an acceleration timescale is comparable to an ics cooling timescale . for typical rich clusters ,",
    "this critical energy is a few tev ( loeb & waxman 2000 ; totani & kitayama 2000 ) .",
    "thus , both ics and ntb can contribute to hard x - ray radiation .",
    "when electron momentum spectra are single power - law , sarazin and kempner ( 2000 ) shows that ntb is dominant in hard x - ray if the momentum spectral index is more than @xmath3 2.7 .",
    "although accelerated electron momentum spectra in shocks are single power - law , total spectra in cg do not have to have the same form because various cooling processes can change the spectral shape . in a higher energy range , ics and synchrotron loss",
    "modify the spectral shape from that of the source . in lower energy range ,",
    "on the other hand , coulomb loss does .",
    "therefor , we have to to follow time evolution of electron momentum spectra to investigate hard x - ray emission from cg .    in this paper , we calculate time evolution of electron momentum spectra for spherically symmetric models of cg and investigate evolution of both ntb and ics contributions in hard x - ray .",
    "it is certain that the synchrotron radio spectrum of coma is known to a much higher precision than its hard x - ray spectrum .",
    "however , synchrotron emissivity is proportional to the non - thermal electron density and the magnetic field energy density .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have enough information about their spatial distribution . on the other hand ,",
    "ics and ntb emissivity are proportional to the non - thermal electron density and , the cmb energy density and the thermal icm density , respectively .",
    "we have enough spatial information about both of them from radio and x - ray observations .",
    "thus , we think calculating the ntb and ics hard x - ray spectra is as useful as calculating synchrotron radio ones in order to consider physical property of non - thermal electrons in clusters of galaxies .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ s : models ] we describe our models . in  [ s : results ] we present the results . in ",
    "[ s : coma ] we compare our models to coma cluster and discuss their implications . finally , our conclusions are presented in ",
    "[ s : conclusions ] .",
    "to follow evolution of momentum spectra of a non - thermal electron population , we should solve a diffusion loss equation ( sarazin 1999 ) . according to bohm diffusion approximation , however , the spatial diffusion term is negligible in typical intracluster conditions within a few gyrs ( takizawa & naito 2000 ) .",
    "we consider an isotropic momentum distribution function .",
    "it is not clear whether the electron pitch angle distribution is randomized or not in typical intracluster conditions .",
    "however , this isotropic assumption is clearly valid when we consider inverse compton , bremsstrahlung , and coulomb losses because faraday rotation measurements toward clusters of galaxies suggest tangled magnetic field in intracluster space .",
    "chaotic field lines also give rise to isotropic emission independent of the electron pitch angle distribution .",
    "only synchrotron loss rate depends on the pitch angle distribution but it does not dominate other loss processes within our parameter range .",
    "we consider spherically symmetric icm for simplicity .",
    "we will use the normalized electron momentum defined by @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath5 be the number density of non - thermal electrons with momenta from @xmath6 to @xmath7 at the radius @xmath8 .",
    "thus , the equation which describes time evolution of @xmath9 is , @xmath10          + q(p_e , r , t),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath11 is the rate of normalized momentum loss for a single electron with a normalized momentum of @xmath6 at the radius @xmath8 , and @xmath12 gives the rate of production of new non - thermal electrons .",
    "we consider ics of the cmb photons , synchrotron loss , and coulomb loss to determine @xmath13 ) .",
    "bremsstrahlung loss is neglected because it does not contribute significantly in our parameter range .",
    "thus , @xmath14 each component is numerically ( see longair 1997 ) , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the intracluster magnetic field strength , and @xmath17 is the electron density of thermal icm .",
    "we consider cmb photons at z=0 as soft photon density calculating inverse compton loss rate .",
    "we use 2.7 k as cmb temperature .",
    "the loss rate @xmath18 and cooling time defined by @xmath19 are shown in figure [ fig : bandtc ] as a function of @xmath6 when @xmath20@xmath21 and @xmath22 g .",
    "ics loss is dominant for a higher energy region ( @xmath23 ) , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the loss rate is well approximated by coulomb loss with an extremely relativistic limit in a middle region @xmath26 , where @xmath18 is almost constant and @xmath27 .",

    "we use the extreme - relativistic limit of bethe - heitler formula for the extremely relativistic ( @xmath44 ) electrons .",
    "on the other hand , we use the transrelativistic expressions of equations ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) in haug ( 1997 ) for weakly relativistic electrons ( @xmath45 ) and moderately relativistic ( @xmath46 ) electrons , respectively .",
    "the distortion of the electron wave function by the nuclear coulomb field is considered by multiplying the elwert factor .    for ics components ,",

    "the total number of thermal electrons is @xmath66 and the total thermal energy of electrons is @xmath67 erg .",
    "we assume @xmath68 g . evolution of non - thermal electrons hardly depends on the magnetic field strength unless magnetic field energy density becomes comparable to or more than cmb one .    for the non - thermal electron populations",

    "thus , @xmath75 is , @xmath76 where @xmath77 has a dimension of number density per time .",
    "some candidates are proposed for the origin of a non - thermal population . as for a electron component",
    ", however , shocks in icm caused by cluster merger is believed to be the most promising because they have enough and more energy than other candidates such as agns or normal galaxies .",
    "furthermore , it is difficult to explain the typical spatial size of radio halos and relics for point sources like agns and galaxies because diffusion length within ics cooling time is too short . in the present model ,",
    "thus , we set @xmath78gyr , which is roughly equal to the duration of shocks in cluster mergers ( takizawa 1999 , 2000 ) .",
    "spatial distribution of electron injection is not clear because it depends on detailed parameters of cluster mergers .",
    "thus we set fairly simple assumption .",
    "we assume it is proportional to local electron thermal energy .",
    "total local injected energy of the non - thermal population is assumed to be 5% of the total local energy of thermal electrons .",
    "therefor , normalization of source term @xmath79 is , @xmath80 according to the standard theory of first - order fermi acceleration , it is expected that exponents of momentum spectra @xmath32 are @xmath81 in non - relativistic strong shocks ( see jones & ellison 1991 ) .",
    "however , fairly low mach number shocks are expected in cluster mergers because the icm of the pre - merger clusters is already hot ( takizawa 1999 , 2000 ; miniati et al .",
    "in fact , some x - ray observations support this idea",
    "( e.g. , markevitch , sarazin & vikhlinin 1999 ; kikuchi et al . 2000 ) .",
    "thus we consider the cases of @xmath82 , and @xmath83",
    "figure [ fig : pspec ] shows evolution of a total electron momentum spectrum in the @xmath84 model . in all models electron momentum spectra evolve in a similar way as follows . while fresh non - thermal electrons are provided ( @xmath85gyr ) , the spectra change from the original single power - law form ( @xmath86 ) into a steady state solution where the injection balances with the cooling . in",
    "the higher energy range the spectra change from @xmath87 into @xmath88 because ics cooling is dominant . in the lower energy range , on the other hand , the spectra change into @xmath89 because coulomb loss is dominant .",
    "after the injection stops ( @xmath90gyr ) , inverse compton cut - off appears and shifts towards lower energy as time proceeds . in the lower energy range , the spectra change into a steady state solution without a source term , @xmath91 .",

    "sarazin & kempner ( 2000 ) shows that both components are comparable to each other with @xmath93 when electron momentum spectra are single power - law .",
    "however , note that we consider different situations in our models , electron sources are power - law ( @xmath85gyr ) or not active ( @xmath90gyr ) and evolution of electron spectra are fully calculated . in sarazin & kempner ( 2000 ) , on the other hand",
    ", power - law electron spectra are assumed for `` power - law '' models , which correspond to only a very early epoch ( @xmath94 ) in our models where cooling does not play a significant role .",
    "they also consider `` cooling electrons '' model , where spectra are assumed to be in a steady state without any sources .",
    "this corresponds to a phase where source is not active ( @xmath90gyr ) in our models .",
    "our results are different than theirs because electron momentum spectra are much modified from a single power - law form in the source term because of the various cooling processes .",
    "in particular , spectral flattening in lower energy owing to coulomb cooling is important .",
    "( 140mm,140mm)fig3.eps    although total energy injected into a non - thermal electron population is the same value in all models , the flatter the source electron spectra are , the more luminous the total hard x - ray emission is .",
    "this is because the electrons related to ics components lose their kinetic energy mainly through ics loss while the electrons related to ntb components lose their kinetic energy mainly through not bremsstrahlung loss but coulomb interaction with the thermal icm .",
    "thus , ics dominant models are much more efficient for energy transformation from non - thermal electrons into hard x - ray radiation .",
    "this point is very important when the origin of non - thermal electrons is discussed .",
    "after injection stops ( @xmath90gyr ) , both components of hard x - ray emission decrease in all models .",
    "however , timescales of decline are rather different between ntb and ics components . in all models",
    "ics components decrease in the same way .",
    "the decline timescale of ics components is determined by ics cooling time of the relevant electrons , which is commonly @xmath3 a gyr for all models because energy of the related electrons is @xmath3 gev ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bandtc]b ) . however , this is not the case for ntb components .",
    "the flatter the source spectra are , the more slowly ntb components decrease .",
    "the reason of this behavior is as follows .",
    "when the source spectra are flatter , equilibrium electron spectra are also flatter . thus , not only weakly relativistic electrons but also higher energy ( @xmath3 100 mev ) electrons contribute to the hard x - ray through ntb significantly . while cooling time of weakly relativistic ( @xmath95 kev ) electrons is very short ( @xmath96 yr , see fig . [",
    "fig : bandtc]b ) , that of @xmath97 mev electrons is fairly long ( @xmath3 a few gyr ) . as a result ,",
    "the contribution from higher energy electrons survives for several gyrs in ntb hard x - ray .",
    "this is more prominent when the source spectra are flatter",
    ".    observed hard x - ray spectra are often parameterized by a single power - law model .",
    "thus , we fit our resultant total hard x - ray spectra into a single power - law model ( @xmath98 ) to get a spectral index @xmath99 .",
    "figure [ fig : sindex ] shows evolution of the spectral indices of total hard x - ray ( 20 - 80 kev ) spectra . the behavior depends on whether ics or ntb components are dominant . when ics components are dominant ( @xmath100 ) , spectral indices @xmath99 changes from @xmath101 into @xmath102 while the source is active ( @xmath85gyr ) .",
    "after the injection stops , the indices become much smaller values because the inverse compton cut - off enters a hard x - ray range .",
    "when ntb components are dominant ( @xmath103 ) , on the other hand , the indices evolve in a rather different way .",
    "they become steady state values more quickly . in this stage ,",
    "the indices are @xmath104 within our models .",
    "after the injection stops ( @xmath90gyr ) , they become @xmath105 , which is an approximation to a spectrum that varies as the logarithm of the photon energy ( see sarazin & kempner 2000 ) . in this way , ntb dominant models result in rather flat hard x - ray spectra .",
    "( 160mm,160mm)fig4.eps    ntb flux is proportional to a volume integral of the square of the icm density because we assume that injection of non - thermal electrons is proportional to the local icm density . on the other hand ,",

    "thus , we conclude that ics is more likely as the origin of coma hard x - ray . in this case , however , the flux ratio of synchrotron radio to ics hard x - ray gives us the volume averaged magnetic field strength .",
    "this value must coincide with that determined from faraday rotation toward individual polarized radio galaxies unless spatial inhomogeneity plays an significant role .",
    "thus , we should look for other solutions for the apparent discrepancy between magnetic field strength derived from the above - mentioned two methods .",
    "it may be related to spatial configurations of cluster magnetic field .",
    "our conclusions suggest that the momentum spectrum of the electron sources in coma is fairly flat ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "this is consistent with radio observations .",
    "deiss et al .",
    "( 1997 ) shows the radio spectral index in the frequencies lower than 1.4 ghz is @xmath142 , which corresponds to @xmath143 in the electron source term in a steady state ( note that equilibrium electron spectra are steeper than source spectra because of ics cooling ) .",
    "however , this implies fairly high mach number shocks . according to the standard theory of shock acceleration",
    ", @xmath141 means a mach number more than 3.0 .",
    "this value is somewhat lager than estimated values ( @xmath144 ) of merger shocks from x - ray observations of other clusters ( e.g. , markevitch , sarazin , & vikhlinin 1999 ; kikuchi et al . 2000 ) .",
    "however , estimated mach numbers can be underestimated because observed temperature gradients can be underestimated owing to contamination by foreground and/or background icm ( takizawa 2000 , shibata et al .",
    "thus , it is possible that such hidden high mach number shocks contribute to particle acceleration in coma .",
    "indeed , merger shocks with a mach number more than 3 do exist in numerical simulations of cosmological structure formation ( miniati et al .",
    "another possibility is acceleration at external accretion shocks , which can be very high mach number shocks because accreting gas is much colder than cluster virial temperature ( miniati et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "another possibility is reacceleration in intracluster space due to turbulent alfvn waves and/or other physical process ( brunetti et al . 2001 ; ohno , takizawa , & shibata 2001 ) . in this case",
    "an electron spectrum can be much modified from an original source form . as a result ,",
    "situation effectively similar to our @xmath84 model possibly occurs though it depends on detailed acceleration history of non - thermal electrons .",
    "in general , it is believed that non - thermal energy is less than thermal one in icm .",
    "only ics dominant models with flat source spectra can satisfy this situation among our models . even in this case , however , the obtained non - thermal to thermal energy ratio is fairly high .",
    "for example , tev gamma - ray observation of sn1006 suggests this ratio is a few % ( tanimori et al .",
    "1998 ) , whereas our @xmath84 model implies this ratio is more than 10 % .",
    "however , note that total energy of non - thermal electrons is sensitive to a spectral shape in lower energy .",
    "we assume that source spectra are power - law in momentum down to @xmath145 .",
    "this is valid when thermal electrons in icm are the source of non - thermal electrons .",
    "however , this is not the case when old non - thermal electrons which leaked from agns and/or galaxies , and/or fossil radio plasma ( ensslin & gopal - krishna 2001 ) are the source .",
    "once electrons are accelerated up to @xmath97 mev , they have a fairly long ( @xmath3 a few gyr ) life time .",
    "thus , it is possible that lower boundary energy of single power - law is larger and that required energy is less .",
