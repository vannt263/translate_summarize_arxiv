    "the piecewise deterministic markov processes ( denoted pdmps ) were first introduced in the literature by davis ( @xcite ) . already at this time , the theory of diffusions had such powerful tools as the theory of it calculus and stochastic differential equations at its disposal .",
    "davis s goal was to endow the pdmp with rather general tools .",
    "the main reason for that was to provide a general framework , since up to then only very particular cases had been dealt with , which turned out not to be easily generalizable .",
    "pdmps form a family of cdlg markov processes involving a deterministic motion punctuated by random jumps .",
    "the motion of the pdmp  @xmath0 depends on three local characteristics , namely the jump rate @xmath1 , the flow @xmath2 and the transition measure q according to which the location of the process at the jump time is chosen .",
    "the process starts from @xmath3 and follows the flow @xmath4 until the first jump time @xmath5 which occurs either spontaneously in a poisson - like fashion with rate @xmath6 or when the flow @xmath4 hits the boundary of the state - space . in both cases ,",
    "the location of the process at the jump time @xmath5 , denoted by @xmath7 , is selected by the transition measure @xmath8 and the motion restarts from this new point as before .",
    "this fully describes a piecewise continuous trajectory for @xmath9 with jump times @xmath10 and post jump locations @xmath11 , and which evolves according to the flow @xmath2 between two jumps .",

    "finally , we briefly review some results about a non - parametric statistical method to get an estimate of the conditional density associated with the jumps of a pdmp defined on a separable metric space ( section  [ sec_estimation ] ) and we end with a survey of numerical methods in section  [ sec_numerics ] .",

    "most of these results are essentially of qualitative type , i.e. no practical information can be obtained on the rate of convergence to equilibrium .",
    "the papers @xcite are first attempts to get quantitative results for the long time behavior of special pdmps : tcp ( which is defined in section  [ sec_tcp ] ) for the first one and a pdmp describing the motion of a bacteria for the second one .",
    "we consider a subclass of pdmp sometimes known as `` markov switching model '' .",
    "the `` natural '' state space of this process is the product space @xmath77  as was said in remark  [ rmrk : espace_etat ] , this fits within the general theory described above . to define the process , consider @xmath78 vector fields @xmath79 , @xmath80 ,  , @xmath81 on @xmath82 .",

    "the corresponding generator is : @xmath101 this process can be constructed as described in section  [ sec_definition ] .",
    "another possible way is to generate a poisson process with a high enough intensity to `` propose '' jump times , and to accept or reject these jumps with probabilities depending only on the values of @xmath102 at the current point ( see section  2 of  @xcite for details ) .",
    "this naturally defines a discrete process @xmath103 ( a markov chain ) , which turns out to be an alternative to the chain @xmath104 defined above , in the sense that results similar to theorem  [ th : costaetdufour ] hold .    in this model ,",
    "the trajectory of the `` position '' @xmath105 does not jump , it evolves continuously .",
    "the jumps only occur on the discrete part @xmath98 , the one that dictates which ( deterministic ) dynamics the position must follow .",
    "let us also note that there are no `` boundary jumps '' in this model : for every @xmath106 , the quantity @xmath107 defined by   is infinite .",
    "many questions that seem intractable for fully general pdmps can be answered in this restricted framework . in particular ,",
    "a kind of regularity for the law of @xmath108 can be established if the vector fields satisfy a condition that closely resembles hrmander s classical condition for diffusion .",
    "these results are described in the following section . in the next one",
    "we discuss results on the `` infinite time '' behaviour of the process : once more , exponential convergence to equilibrium can be proved under fairly weak assumptions .",
    "we are interested here in criteria that guarantee a regularity for the law of the continuous part , @xmath94 .",
    "for the sake of comparison , let @xmath109 be an @xmath78-dimensional brownian motion , and consider the solution of the following ( stratonovich ) sde : @xmath110 depending on the @xmath85 , the law of @xmath94 may or may not have a density with respect to lebesgue measure .",
    "for example , if the @xmath85 are constant , the law is regular if and only if the @xmath85 span @xmath82 . for non - constant fields",
    "there is a well - known criterion for regularity , known as hrmander s criterion , and expressed in terms of the @xmath85 and their iterated lie brackets .",
    "thanks to this criterion , one may prove that the law of a kinetic process @xmath111 driven only by a brownian motion on its velocity is immediately absolutely continuous , with a regular density ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .    in our case ,",
    "there is no hope for such a strong result .",
    "indeed , the probability that @xmath108 has not jumped at all between @xmath112 and @xmath113 is strictly positive , therefore the law of @xmath94 has a singular part  we will see a similar phenomenon in the study of the tcp process with the lower bound .",
    "however , let us define the following families of vector fields : @xmath114 , g \\in \\mathcal{v}_i\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with these notations the following result holds :    [ absolute continuity , @xcite ] [ thrm : regularity ] suppose there is a point @xmath115 and an integer @xmath116 such that the `` bracket condition '' holds , i.e.  the iterated lie brackets @xmath117 span @xmath82 . then there is a time @xmath118 , a strictly positive @xmath119 , and two probability measures @xmath120 on @xmath121 such that :    * the law @xmath122 of @xmath94 starting from @xmath123 can be written as @xmath124 , * the `` continuous '' part @xmath125 is absolutely continuous with respect to the product of the lebesgue measure on @xmath82 and the counting measure on @xmath126 .",
    "similar results are obtained in @xcite for the discrete chain @xmath127 ; they involve another ( weaker ) bracket condition .",
    "to study the long time behaviour of @xmath108 , it is natural to look for an analogue of the @xmath128-limit set ( defined when there is only one flow ) . to that end , first define the positive trajectory of @xmath91 as the set @xmath129 that is , @xmath130 is the set of points reachable from @xmath91 by a trajectory of the process . recall that all the @xmath85 leave a compact set @xmath55 invariant .",
    "the right limit set to consider is the _",
    "accessible set _ , the ( possibly empty ) compact set @xmath131 defined as @xmath132 informally this is the set of points that are ( approximately ) reachable from anywhere in @xmath55 by following the flows .",
    "this set is deeply connected with the invariant measures of the process .",
    "let @xmath133 be the set of probability measures that are invariant for the process , and let @xmath134 be the finite index set .       1 .   if @xmath135 then @xmath136 for all @xmath137 and there exists @xmath138 such that @xmath139 2 .",
    "if @xmath140 has nonempty interior , then @xmath141 for all @xmath142 .",
    "3 .   suppose that @xmath133 is a singleton @xmath143 .",
    "then @xmath144    once more , similar statements hold for the invariant measures of the discrete chain @xmath127 .    a usual way of proving convergence to equilibrium for markov chains or processes , following the classical idea of the foster - lyapunov criterion , is to identify a `` good '' subset @xmath145 of the state space , satisfying two properties :    * the process has a tendency to return to @xmath145 ; * for any @xmath3 , @xmath91 in @xmath145 , the laws of the process starting from @xmath3 and @xmath91 are similar in some sense .    if these two properties hold , one can construct a coupling between trajectories in three steps :    * wait for the two processes to come back to @xmath145 ; * once they are in @xmath145 , using the second property to try to couple them ; * if the coupling fails , go back to step @xmath62 .    in the classical case of a discrete markov chain , @xmath145 will usually be a single point so that the second property will be trivial ; the `` tendency to return '' will typically follow from the existence of a lyapunov function .",
    "this type of technique is refined and generalized for markov chains on general state spaces in the renowned book by meyn and tweedie  @xcite .    in our case , without additional assumptions , we can not hope to find a lyapunov function .",
    "however , if @xmath140 is not empty , and if @xmath123 is a point in @xmath140 , we can prove  using compactness arguments  that the process will visit infinitely often any neighborhood of @xmath123 .    to use the heuristics above , it remains to show that two copies of the process , starting from a point near @xmath123 , have a good chance to couple .",
    "this is where the regularity results may be used : two variables with strictly positive density can be coupled with positive probability .",
    "this is the main idea of the proof of :    [ exponential convergence , @xcite ] suppose that the `` bracket condition '' of theorem  [ thrm : regularity ] is satisfied at a point @xmath146 .",
    "then there exists a unique invariant probability measure @xmath147 , its support is @xmath148 , and @xmath149 converges exponentially fast in total variation norm : @xmath150    these convergence results are quite general .",
    "however , there is no hope to find reasonable convergence rates by this approach , since we used compactness arguments . in particular cases",
    ", one can often use the specific structure of the process to prove much better bounds .",
    "this is done in the markov switching case under additional assumptions in @xcite .",
    "the next section describes similar results for the slightly different case of the tcp window - size process .",
    "beyond the problems of existence , uniqueness , and regularity of an invariant probability measure , an important and challenging question is to get explicit and efficient rates of convergence to equilibrium for pdmps .",
    "it seems hard to address the problem via spectral methods since a pdmp is generally , and inherently , non reversible ( see however @xcite for positive results in this direction ) . as mentioned previously , coupling methods ``  la '' meyn - tweedie can be applied but hardly give efficient rates of convergence .",
    "we will present here a specific method that allows to treat one specific ( and relatively simple ) example of pdmp , the so - called tcp window - size process .",
    "the tcp window - size process appears as a scaling limit of the transmission rate of a server uploading packets on the internet according to the algorithm used in the tcp ( transmission control protocol ) in order to avoid congestions ( see  @xcite for details on this scaling limit ) .",
    "this process @xmath151 has @xmath152 as state space and its infinitesimal generator is given , for any smooth function @xmath153 , by @xmath154 this means that the transmission rate is increased linearly when there is no congestion , and divided by two in case of congestion .",
    "a congestion occurs at random times , with rate given by the value of the transmission rate .",
    "this process is rather simple and its stationary regime is well understood : it is ergodic and admits a unique invariant probability measure @xmath147 , with an explicit density ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "getting an explicit speed of convergence is however not so simple , since the tcp process is irreversible but also because , in some sense , it `` lacks randomness '' ( the only randomness comes from the jump times ) , what makes any coupling procedure delicate , particularly for convergence in total variation norm . in the following , the semigroup associated to the tcp process will be denoted @xmath155 .",
    "the speed of convergence in wasserstein distance can be dealt with using a coupling first introduced in @xcite .",
    "this is a markov process on @xmath156 whose marginals are two tcp processes , and which is defined by its generator as follows : if @xmath157 , @xmath158 and it is given by the symmetric expression if @xmath159 . in words , with a rate equal to the minimum of the two coordinates , both trajectories jump simultaneously , and with a rate equal to the difference between the two coordinates the higher trajectory jumps alone ( and the lower one never jumps alone ) .",
    "it induces problems since the higher trajectory may jump alone even when the distance between both trajectories is small ( hence at a small but positive rate ) , increasing dramatically this distance .",
    "this can also be seen on computation , noting that this dynamics does not contract the distance between trajectories in @xmath160 distance , for any @xmath161",
    ". however , one gets ( non uniform ) contraction for @xmath162 . working this out , and using also a bound on any moment of the process at any time uniformly in the starting point",
    ", one finally gets the following result :    [ explicit rate for tcp in wasserstein distance , @xcite ] [ th : wasserstein ] let @xmath163 and @xmath164 . for any @xmath165 , any @xmath161 and any @xmath166",
    ", there is a constant @xmath167 such that , for any initial probability measures @xmath69 and @xmath168 and any @xmath169 , @xmath170    this result can be compared to numerical simulations : the exponential rate of convergence for the @xmath171 wasserstein distance to the invariant measure is about @xmath172 , and the one for the @xmath173 distance between both coordinates of the coupling we used is about @xmath174 ( which means that one can not do better using this coupling ) .",
    "let us first note that , even starting from two arbitrarily close initial conditions , there is a positive probability that two tcp processes never have jumped before a given time @xmath113 , which gives an immediate and striking lower bound for the total variation distance between laws at time @xmath113 . to be more specific , the first jump time @xmath175 of the tcp process starting from @xmath3 is characterized by @xmath176 .",
    "this implies that @xmath177 consequently , this distance is not tending to 0 as @xmath91 tends to @xmath3 .",
    "nevertheless , it can be shown that , for @xmath91 close to @xmath3 , the distance is really on the order of this lower bound . to note that",
    ", we construct a coupling which tries to stick two tcp processes in one jump . indeed",
    ", assume that @xmath159 and denote by @xmath178 the first jump time of the process starting from @xmath3 and @xmath179 the two first jump times of a tcp process starting from @xmath91 .",
    "then if these random variables satisfy the two relations @xmath180 and @xmath181 , both processes are at the same position at time @xmath178 , hence can be coupled from this time .",
    "the higher probability of getting is an optimal coupling probability for two measures with density , it can hence be computed explicitly , and gives an upper bound on the order of .",
    "we finally can construct a coupling in the following way : for any @xmath182 , we use the dynamical coupling defined in during a time @xmath183 on the order of @xmath184 to try to make the trajectories @xmath185 close ; we then try to stick them in a time @xmath186 on the order of @xmath187 .",
    "taking @xmath188 to @xmath112 gives the following result :    [ explicit rate for tcp in total variation , @xcite ] [ th : variation ] let @xmath1 as defined in theorem [ th : wasserstein ] .",
    "for any @xmath189 and any @xmath166 , there exists @xmath190 such that , for any initial probability measures @xmath69 and @xmath168 and any @xmath169 , @xmath191      this strategy ( first apply a coupling which is efficient for the wasserstein distance , then stick the trajectories in one single attempt ) can also be used for other processes .",
    "we can treat for example the case of the tcp process with constant jump rate , with generator @xmath192 @xmath193 being fixed .",
    "this gives a purely probabilistic proof ( and slightly better constants ) of results first obtained in an analytic way by perthame and ryzhik in @xcite .",
    "the same idea can also be applied to diffusion processes , associating recent results from @xcite on the convergence in wasserstein distance with results on the regularity of the semigroup at small time from @xcite .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for details .",
    "the intrinsic variability of a large class of biological systems is the subject of an intensive area of research since a few years .",
    "spatially extended conductance based models of biological excitable membranes , and more particularly of neuronal membranes @xcite , are considered , at an appropriate scale , as hybrid stochastic models @xcite .",
    "more precisely , these models can be regarded as belonging to the subclass of stochastic hybrid models consisting of pdmps @xcite .",
    "the neurons are the basic building blocks of the nervous systems .",
    "they are , roughly speaking , made of three parts : the dendrites , the soma and the axon . in the present discussion ,",
    "we focus our attention on the axon , also referred as nerve fiber .",
    "the main role of the axon is to transmit , for example to another neuron , the signal it received from the soma .",
    "this electrical signal is called the nerve impulse or the action potential or the spike .",
    "the target neuron may be far from the neuron which emits the spike , therefore the nerve fiber is often much longer than width and for mathematical convenience we model the axon by a segment , here the segment @xmath194 $ ] .",
    "as for all biological cells , the neuronal membrane allows the exchanges of ions between the internal and the external cellular media through the ionic channels .",
    "we assume that these ionic channels are disposed at discrete location along the axon : at a location @xmath195 is a ionic channel where @xmath196 is a finite subset of @xmath197 of cardinality @xmath198 .",
    "when an ionic channel is open , it allows a flow of ions to enter or leave the cell , that is , it allows a current to pass .",
    "we denote by @xmath199 , where @xmath200 is a finite state space , the state of the channel at location @xmath201 .",
    "basically a state is to be open or closed .",
    "when open , an ionic channel in the state @xmath202 allows the ions of a certain specie associated to @xmath202 to pass through the membrane .",
    "if we write @xmath203 for the local potential of the neuronal membrane , often called the trans - membrane potential , then the current which passes through the membrane is given by @xmath204 where @xmath205 is the conductance of the ionic channel in state @xmath202 and @xmath206 the associated driven potential .",
    "the quantities @xmath205 and @xmath206 are both real constants , the first being positive .",
    "the sign of @xmath207 tells us if the ions corresponding to the state @xmath202 are leaving or entering the cell .",
    "the rate at which the channel at location @xmath201 goes from one state @xmath202 to another state @xmath208 depends on the local trans - membrane potential @xmath203 and is denoted in the sequel by @xmath209 .",
    "for example , when the local potential @xmath203 is high , the ionic channels in a specific state @xmath202 will have the tendency to open whereas when @xmath203 is low , the ionic channels in the same state @xmath202 will have the tendency to close .",
    "this is this mechanism which allows the creation of an action potential and gradually its propagation along the axon .",
    "let @xmath190 be the capacitance of the axon membrane , @xmath210 the radius of the axon and @xmath211 its internal resistance , this three quantities being positive constants",
    ". the classical conductance based model for the propagation of the nerve impulse is the cable equation @xmath212 where @xmath213 denotes the state of the channel at location @xmath201 .",

    "let us be more specific about the assumptions on the jump rates of the ionic channels .",
    "we assume that the function @xmath218 are smooth and take values between two fixed positive constants .",
    "this assumption certainly holds in the classical models for excitable membrane such as the hodgkin - huxley model , morris - lecar model or models in calcium dynamics . to gain a more accurate insight in conductance based neuron model we refer to the classical book  @xcite .",

    "thanks to these considerations , we provide a way to estimate an approximation @xmath288 of the jump rate @xmath283 .",
    "our strategy for estimating the conditional probability density function @xmath273 consists in the introduction of a partition @xmath289 of the state space and two functions @xmath290 and @xmath291 , where @xmath145 is a set containing @xmath3 .",

    "one may give an interpretation of these two functions .",
    "first , @xmath290 is an approximation of the jump rate @xmath293 of the inter - jumping time @xmath281 given @xmath294 and @xmath295 , under the stationary regime , for @xmath296 and @xmath297 . roughly speaking ,",
    "@xmath290 may be seen as the jump rate from @xmath145 to @xmath298 at time @xmath113 under the stationary regime .",

    "we propose to estimate both the functions @xmath290 and @xmath291 in order to provide a consistent estimator of the density of interest @xmath273 .",
    "firstly , our work is inspired by the smoothing methods proposed by ramlau - hansen in @xcite and the previous work of azas et al .",
    "we provide a nonparametric kernel estimator @xmath301 of @xmath290 .",

    "this nonparametric estimator of the conditional distribution of the inter - jumping times is easy to compute from the observation of the embedded chain @xmath276 within a long time .",
    "however , the choice of the set @xmath145 and the partition @xmath289 remains an open issue .",
    "a lot of numerical methods have been developed recently to simulate diffusion processes and compute expectations , stopping times and other interesting quantities ( see references in @xcite for example ) .",
    "but since pdmps are in essence discontinuous at random times , these results turn out to be too specific to be applied to them .",
    "besides , another important source of complication is the fact that the transition semigroup @xmath308 of @xmath9 can not be explicitly computed from the local characteristics @xmath309 of the pdmp ( see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it turns out to be hard to give an explicit expression for the markov kernel @xmath310 associated with the markov chain @xmath9 .",
    "also , the markov chain @xmath9 is , in general , not even a feller chain ( see @xcite , pages 76 and 77 ) .",
    "on the other hand , pdmps exhibit some nice specific properties .",
    "for instance , all the randomness of the process can be described by the discrete time ( continuous state space ) markov chain @xmath311 of the post jump locations and inter - jump times .    there",
    "exist essentially two families of numerical methods . the first one is based on the discretization the markov kernel @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the second one relies on a discretization of the markov chain @xmath311 using quantization @xcite .",
