    "<S> a macroscopic elastic description of stresses in static , preloaded granular media is derived systematically from the microscopic elasticity of individual inter - grain contacts . the assumed preloaded state and friction at contacts ensure that the network of inter - grain contacts is not altered by small perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> the texture of this network , set by the preparation of the system , is encoded in second and fourth order fabric tensors . </S>",
    "<S> a small perturbation generates both normal and tangential inter - grain forces , the latter causing grains to reorient . </S>",

    "<S> by contrast , if a pile of the same shape is prepared layer by layer , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ , by sprinkling from an extended source , the pressure profile _ does _ acquire a maximum at the center of the base ( ` pressure hump ' ) liu , brockbank , vanel , geng2001 . </S>",
    "<S> these and similar experiments indicate that the local structure of the pile ( often called ` texture ' ) , which governs stress transmission , depends sensitively on the preparation of the system . in two dimensional packings of monodisperse disks   @xcite , for example , the observed distribution of inter - grain contact orientations reflects the local grain ordering , with a clear six - fold modulation . however , as expected from simple symmetry arguments ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> preparation for an illustration ) , the distribution displays a stronger degree of anisotropy ( including two- and four - fold modulations ) in a usual pile , built with a point source , than in a pile grown by sprinkling grains . </S>",

    "<S> although these models reproduce experimental features , they leave stresses underspecified ( and consequently rely on a somewhat _ ad hoc _ constraint among stress components ) , as a result of an incomplete treatment of inter - grain forces . furthermore </S>",
    "<S> , careful investigations of force transmission models bouchaud2001,socolar2002,socolar2003 seem to indicate that disorder in the granular packing might cause it to behave again as an elastic medium at large scales . in this spirit , </S>",

    "<S> @xcite reviews the various possible outcomes of an ( orthotropic ) @xcite anisotropic elastic theory @xcite , without however addressing the origin of the anisotropy in the context of granular media .    in a continuum </S>",
    "<S> , any volume element is compactly embedded in the surrounding medium . by contrast , in more fragile granular media , stress is transmitted through isolated inter - grain contacts , and under a perturbation grains slightly reorient with respect to their surroundings . </S>",
    "<S> this occurs even in the case of a simple compressive strain : consider for example a compression along the @xmath0-axis and focus on the contact of a given grain with a neighbouring grain . </S>",
    "<S> the torque that this contact imparts to the grain vanishes only if the contact is parallel or perpendicular to the @xmath0-axis . </S>",
    "<S> thus , generically , a non - vanishing total torque is applied on a grain by contacting grains , and consequently it reorients so as to restore the torque to zero in equilibrium . a continuum theory derived from inter - grain forces must include effects of grain reorientation . in this vein , a generalization of usual elasticity that accommodates the ` micro - rotation '  of points in addition to the ` macro - rotation '  of the medium </S>",
    "<S> was formulated by the cosserat brothers  @xcite , and subsequently generalized and applied to ` complex ' continuum media @xcite .    in the present work , </S>",
    "<S> our starting point is the well - established elastic theory of inter - grain contacts  @xcite ; on this basis , we construct a specific macroscopic elastic theory @xcite that encodes the texture of the granular network . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a preloaded granular medium  @xcite and small applied incremental stresses , so that the corresponding elastic response be linear . </S>",
    "<S> while the unperturbed inter - grain forces reflect the rolling and sliding  @xcite that occur during the preparation of the system , as well as the external preloading , if any , we expect the response of the medium to small incremental stresses to be sensitive only to properties of the ( unperturbed ) contact network . </S>",

    "<S> consequently , the linear elastic response  of such a contact is characterized by stiffness constants @xmath9 for compression or traction along the centre - to - centre vector @xmath10 ( henceforth called _ contact vector _ ) ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> hertz - thick(b ) ) and @xmath11 for transverse forces due to shearing ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ hertz - thick](c ) ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> transverse forces are also generated by the reorientation of two contacting grains ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> typically , @xmath1 , implying @xmath12 , and the ratio @xmath13 is fixed by @xmath14 ; for example , for a purely compressively preloaded contact @xmath15  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to compressive and shearing forces , torques may be transmitted through twisted inter - grain contacts , with a corresponding stiffness @xmath16 relating the twist angle to the torque . as long as @xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> such twisting torques contribute negligibly to the behaviour of the medium and we neglect them in the present work . </S>",
    "<S> ( in the case of non - spherical ( _ e.g. _ , faceted ) grains , in which twisting modes may be more relevant , one can keep track of them by defining a torque flux tensor , often termed ` couple stress ' in cosserat theories @xcite , and proceed as with the stress tensor defined below . ) combining these various elements , we write the force exerted by grain b on grain a as @xmath17where@xmath18and the sum over repeated indices is understood . </S>",
    "<S> the tensor @xmath19 is antisymmetric and is defined such that the rotation matrix @xmath20 _ { ij}\\approx \\delta _ { ij}+\\omega _ { ij}^{\\text{g}}$ ] describes the _ reorientation _ of grain g. we note that the mean reorientation , @xmath21 , results in a sheared contact ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ hertz - thick](d ) ) and thus contributes to the force ( eq . </S>",

    "<S> , we identify the displacements @xmath23 of the centers of the grains ( labelled by g ) with a smoothly varying , macroscopic displacement field @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , we identify the grain reorientation @xmath25 with a smooth reorientation field @xmath26 , to be determined . in doing so </S>",
    "<S> , we neglect the non - affine component of the grain displacements . </S>",
    "<S> this approximation is exact in the limit of a simple crystalline granular network , in which all grains are equivalent , but we expect it to be good even away from this limit . if the packing disorder becomes too important , the medium can still be described by an elastic theory , although its effective stiffness constants may depart significantly from those obtained below  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> we emphasize that , as it appears explicitly in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hooke ] ) , the grain reorientation @xmath34 affects inter - grain forces ; it does _ not _ represent the antisymmetric part of the displacement gradient ( which corresponds to solid body rotation and does not generate stress ) .    for a description in terms of stresses , it is convenient to define the average number @xmath35 of contact vectors that lie within a solid angle @xmath36 about direction @xmath33 , per unit volume , and to introduce local _ fabric tensors _  </S>",

    "<S> locally averaged in space , this condition becomes @xmath46or , equivalently,@xmath47this identity will be useful in the derivation of the stress in terms of the strain only , and confirms that grains reorient unless their contacts lie along a principal axis of the strain ( on average ) , _ i.e. _ , unless @xmath48 and @xmath49 commute . in order to compute the stress </S>",
    "<S> , we note that @xmath50 is the number of contact vectors per unit surface area , oriented within @xmath36 about direction @xmath33 , that intersect a surface normal to direction @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath52 is the @xmath53-th component of the force transmitted along such contact vectors , the stress tensor can be written as@xmath54while this expression is not symmetric in general , it is symmetrized as expected by the above vanishing - torque condition ( eq . ( [ commutator ] ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> combining eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hooke][stress ] ) , we obtain@xmath55and@xmath56the right - hand expressions refer to a basis in which @xmath49 is diagonal , and @xmath57 is the @xmath53-th eigenvalue of @xmath49 ; indices @xmath53 and @xmath51 are _ not _ summed over . as expected , the reorientation , @xmath34 , depends on @xmath58 ( through @xmath49 ) but not on @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> equation  ( [ omega ] ) is qualitatively corroborated by the experimental observation  @xcite that @xmath34 is largest in regions of large deformation .    </S>",
    "<S> equations  ( [ omega],[sigma ] ) constitute our central result and describe the response of a preloaded granular medium to an incremental strain . </S>",
    "<S> if the medium is statistically isotropic ( @xmath60 constant ) , we recover standard isotropic elasticity , with lam coefficients @xmath61 and @xmath62 , in agreement with the results of chang and gao  @xcite . in particular , if the poisson ratio @xmath8 of the grain constitutive material is positive , that of the preloaded granular medium , @xmath63 , lies between @xmath64 and @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> ( we recall , however , that in the isotropic limit our coarse - grained theory is only approximate ) . in an anisotropic medium , the fabric tensors @xmath49 and @xmath38 encode the texture of the medium through the dependence of @xmath39 , @xmath9 , @xmath11 , and @xmath41 on @xmath33 . indeed , if @xmath41 varies with @xmath33 or if the preloading stress is anisotropic , stiffness constants may also vary with @xmath33 as contacts are then more or less compressed depending on their orientations and may be sheared . the elastic response described by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sigma ] ) involves only the first few multipolar components of the quantities @xmath66 ( through @xmath49 ) and @xmath67 ( through @xmath38 ) . </S>",
    "<S> monopoles contribute to the isotropic part of the response . </S>",
    "<S> dipoles are absent due to the fore - aft symmetry of the contact distribution . </S>",
    "<S> quadrupoles in @xmath49 and @xmath38 and octupoles in @xmath38 contribute to the anisotropic elastic response . </S>",
    "<S> higher order multipoles play no role in the present linear theory . as to reorientation , given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ omega ] ) , the response is affected solely by the quadrupolar component of @xmath66 .    before concluding , we mention that it is possible to construct an iterative scheme for calculating stresses in a sand pile . </S>",
    "<S> it relies on the assumption that the mechanical noise due to avalanches of grains at the free surface , and other factors such as temperature fluctuations , do not cause significant rearrangements of the contact network  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a rigorous implementation of an iterative scheme still requires knowledge of the complicated mechanisms involved in the growth of the pile , which include both grain avalanching  @xcite and the non - trivial frictional mechanics putting grains to rest  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , these determine both the angular contact distribution and the tangential compressive stresses at the free surface .    as a first attempt at a quantitative understanding , one may focus on the simpler problem of calculating the macroscopic response to an applied point force  @xcite for different possible textures of the granular medium . using eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ omega ] , [ sigma ] ) , we find that stress transmission is very sensitive to the texture as summarized by tensors @xmath49 and @xmath38 , and comes in qualitatively diverse forms . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , depending on the degree of anisotropy , the incremental stress profile may be single- or double - peaked  @xcite , in agreement with refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ; furthermore , the width of the peaks depends also on the degree of anisotropy and , in the single - peak case , may depart from its isotropic counterpart  @xcite .    in sum </S>",
    "<S> , we have derived a macroscopic formulation of stresses in granular media . </S>",
    "<S> this formulation differs from earlier ones in that it incorporates the possibly anisotropic texture of the granular network as well as the reorientation of grains induced by macroscopic deformations . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the central objects in our formulation , the fabric tensors , are defined in terms of the microscopic parameters that characterize inter - grain contacts .    </S>",
    "<S> one can wonder whether this description might bear some signature of a salient experimental fact : the existence of highly stressed regions known as ` force chains '  @xcite , arranged in a percolating , filamentous network that appears to convey a large fraction of the stress through the medium . </S>",
    "<S> analogously  @xcite to force chains , stresses in a crumpled elastic sheet are confined mostly within narrow regions , the folds , if the system is allowed to bend in the third dimension ( of the embedding space )  @xcite . in our case </S>",
    "<S> , grain reorientation may be viewed as an additional degree of freedom which the system uses to relieve stress . </S>",
    "<S> it would be interesting to investigate whether this reorientational freedom of grains may favor , in a heterogeneous system , stress condensation reminiscent of force chains . </S>"
