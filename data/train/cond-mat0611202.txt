    "exploration of unconventional superconducting pairing is one of central issues in the physics of superconductivity",

    "a number of experimental results is consistent with spin - triplet chiral @xmath0-wave symmetry state in this material @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the midgap andreev resonant state ( mars ) @xcite is induced near interfaces in unconventional superconducting junctions where pair potential changes its sign across the fermi surface .",
    "the mars manifests itself as a zero bias conductance peak ( zbcp ) in quasiparticle tunneling experiments .",
    "a number of tunneling data in sr@xmath9ruo@xmath10 junctions show zbcp @xcite in accordance with theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "the josephson effect in sr@xmath9ruo@xmath10 was also studied both theoretically josephson and experimentally @xcite .",
    "recent squid experiment by nelson @xcite is consistent with the realization of chiral @xmath0-wave superconducting state @xcite .    at the same time",
    ", there are important recent achievements in theoretical study of the proximity effect in junctions between unconventional superconductors .",
    "it was predicted that in diffusive normal metal ( dn ) / triplet superconductor ( ts ) junctions mars formed at the dn / ts interface , can penetrate into dn @xcite .",
    "this proximity effect is very unusual since it generates the zero energy peak ( zep ) in the local density of states ( ldos ) in contrast to the conventional proximity effect where the resulting ldos has a minigap @xcite .",
    "it was also shown theoretically , that the zep appears in the chiral @xmath0-wave state . thus to explore the zep in dn region of dn / sr@xmath9ruo@xmath10 heterostructures",
    "is an intriguing topic @xcite .",
    "very recently , it is predicted that the induced cooper pairs in dn are in an unconventional odd - frequency symmetry state , in contrast to the usual even - frequency pairing @xcite .",
    "since this proximity effect specific to ts is completely new phenomenon , it is very interesting to study the josephson effect in ts / dn / ts junctions .",
    "recently , it is shown that the josephson current is enhanced strongly at low temperatures in ts / dn / ts junctions@xcite and is proportional to sin@xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a superconducting phase difference between left and right superconductors @xcite .",
    "these results are quite different from those for @xmath13-wave superconductor / dn / @xmath13-wave superconductor junctions @xcite . however , in most of previous theories of ts / dn / ts junctions , only the @xmath0-wave state in the presence of the time reversal symmetry was considered .",
    "the existing knowledge of the josephson effect in ts / dn / ts junctions for chiral @xmath0-wave symmetry is very limited  @xcite .",
    "it is important to study the josephson effect in the chiral @xmath0-wave junctions in much more detail because this symmetry is the most promising superconducting state in sr@xmath9ruo@xmath10 .    to study this problem ,",
    "the quasi - classical green s function theory is the useful method . in diffusive regime ,",
    "the quasi - classical green s function obeys the usadel equations@xcite .",

    "this theory was recently generalized for unconventional superconductor ( us ) junctions@xcite . in these approach ,",
    "the effect of mars is naturally included .",
    "the theory was extended to the cases of us / dn / us and us / diffusive ferromagnet ( df)/us junctions where time reversal symmetry is present in us @xcite .",

    "the purpose of this paper is to generalize the above approach and apply it to the interface between dn ( df ) / superconductor with broken time reversal symmetry .    in the present paper ,",
    "we derive the boundary conditions of quasiclassical green s function available for dn ( df ) / cp interface in the presence of the josephson effect and calculate the josephson current in cp / dn ( df ) / cp junctions by solving the usadel equations with these boundary conditions .",
    "it is shown that the induced pair in dn is purely in the odd - frequency pairing state .",
    "the magnitude of the calculated josephson current is larger than that in the @xmath4-wave superconductor / dn / @xmath4-wave superconductor ( s / dn / s ) junctions .",
    "however , it is smaller than that in @xmath14-wave superconductor / dn / @xmath15-wave superconductor ( p / dn / p ) junctions .",
    "the obtained temperature dependence of the josephson current is similar to that in the conventional @xmath4-wave junctions .",
    "the current phase relation is almost sinusoidal and the josephson current is proportional to @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the coherence length of the cooper pair in dn and @xmath7 is the width of dn .",
    "we have also calculated the josephson current in cp / df / cp junctions .",
    "similar to the case of the s / df / s junctions , the @xmath16 transition occurs as a function of the length of df .",
    "as follows from these results , it is difficult to extract the unusual properties of proximity effect specific to spin - triplet @xmath0-wave superconductor junctions if we look at d.c .",

    "<S> we study the josephson effect between chiral @xmath0-wave superconductor / diffusive normal metal ( dn ) / chiral @xmath0-wave superconductor ( cp / dn / cp ) junctions using quasiclassical green s function formalism with proper boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1-wave symmetry of superconducting order parameter is chosen which is believed to be a pairing state in sr@xmath2ruo@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the cooper pairs induced in dn have an odd - frequency spin - triplet @xmath4-wave symmetry , where pair amplitude is an odd function of matsubara frequency . despite the peculiar symmetry properties of the cooper pairs , the behavior of the josephson current is rather conventional . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that the current phase relation is almost sinusoidal and the josephson current is proportional to @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the coherence length of the cooper pair in dn and @xmath7 is the length of dn . </S>",
    "<S> the josephson current between cp / diffusive ferromagnet metal ( df ) / cp junctions is also calculated . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the 0-@xmath8 transition can be realized by varying temperature or junction length @xmath7 similar to the case of conventional @xmath4-wave junctions . </S>",
    "<S> these results may serve as a guide to study superconducting state of sr@xmath2ruo@xmath3 . </S>"
