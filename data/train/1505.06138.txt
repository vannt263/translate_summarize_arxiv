    "cloaking of objects from detection by waves governed by the helmholtz equation is nowadays regarded as an interesting and important problem ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the cloaking methods , well - developed for the helmholtz operator , have also been extended to advanced structured media in electromagnetism , elasticity , as well as waves in fluids ( see @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the cloaking system can be understood as a by - pass structure , which routes a probe wave around an object , reducing the scattering by the object to a minimum .",
    "we make a distinction between passive and active cloaking .",
    "passive cloaks do not change their properties and remain unchanged for all frequencies and all types of incident waves .",
    "the drawback of a passive cloak is that its practical implementation can only be effective over a limited range of frequencies ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "active cloaks on the other hand can easily overcome this limitation in their effective frequency range , and can also adapt to various types of incident waves .",
    "active cloaking relies on being able to radiate compensating fields which cancel out perturbations of the incident or probe field by the object to be cloaked @xcite .    in a set of papers @xcite@xcite , a continuous model of an active cloak for the laplace and helmholtz equations was developed .",
    "the model was set as a variational problem and was analysed mathematically in depth , and the effectiveness of the active cloaking was demonstrated .",
    "finite cloaking devices in the continuous framework were introduced to shield any objects within the given `` shielded '' region .    in a recent paper @xcite , an analytical model of an approximate cloak for flexural waves",
    "was developed by introducing a finite number of active sources , whose complex amplitudes were chosen to suppress the scattered field resulting from an interaction of an incident wave with a finite obstacle .",
    "the multipole representation was used for the solution , and the required number of multipoles in the scattered field were constrained to be zero . although the truncation of the multipole representation introduces an approximation error , this approximation was shown to be entirely adequate for a sufficiently wide range of frequencies .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate passive scattering reduction and active cloaking in the context of both the helmhotz equation ( applying to waves in elastic membranes ) and the fourth - order kirchhoff plate theory ( applying to flexural waves in thin elastic plates ) .",
    "we study these phenomena in three frequency ranges : in the first the frequency is sufficiently low , so that wave scattering is dominated by the monopole term , for both membranes and kirchhoff plates .",
    "we show that the following mass - compensation formula @xmath3 is applicable to reduction of scattering by an appropriately chosen coating around the inclusion . here",
    "@xmath4 are mass densities of the inclusion , coating , and ambient matrix , respectively , and @xmath5 are the interior and the exterior radii of the inclusion coating .",
    "this classical formula @xcite has been recently used @xcite in the context of scattering reduction for coated inclusions at low frequencies for which the dominance of the monopole term guarantees the applicability of the criterion ( [ mass_balance ] ) for both the membrane and kirchhoff plate waves .",
    "we show here that , while this formula is effective for membrane waves in reducing the scattering from a second - order to a fourth - order effect , the same is not in general true for kirchhoff waves , where for only very specific choices of material parameters , does the formula ( [ mass_balance ] ) deliver the reduction of scattering to fourth - order .",
    "the failure of ( [ mass_balance ] ) to deliver the reduction to fourth order scattering occurs because in general , an appropriate balance between the helmholtz and modified helmholtz parts of the kirchhoff wave expansion requires suitable choices for flexural rigidities , not just densities .",
    "we also show that , because scattering in the low frequency range is very weak , active cloaking is not necessary .",
    "as the frequency increases dipole and higher order terms become significant .",
    "we show that the choice of coating parameters is not sufficient to generate effective scattering reduction in this intermediate frequency range .",
    "a small number of control sources then delivers effective cloaking .",
    "as the frequency increases further , we enter the resonant scattering region .",
    "these resonances result in strongly enhanced scattering amplitudes , which change rapidly with frequency .",
    "this causes difficulties to arise for the application of active cloaking techniques , as suggested by the following argument .",
    "one strategy by which active cloaking might be defeated would be for the probe beam to be swept in frequency , so that the compensating fields would also have to be frequency - swept in corresponding fashion .",
    "a circumstance under which this would be difficult occurs when the object to be cloaked has resonant scattering properties . in the presence of resonances",
    ", it is difficult to avoid time lags between the change of the probe frequency and the corresponding changes required in the compensating fields around the cloaked object .",
    "these time lags inevitably increase with the sharpness ( or q factor ) of the resonance .",
    "thus , for active cloaking to work well near resonant frequencies , one needs to be able to modify the configuration of the cloaked object , to avoid rapid changes in scattering properties with frequency .",
    "the configurational change we investigate here is the use of the coating around the inclusion to deliver a flat reflectance as a function of frequency , rather than a very low reflectance .",
    "( the latter is inevitably narrow - band at any but the lowest frequency range . )",
    "this we show enables the active cloaking of the coated inclusion to operate effectively over the frequency region of flat reflectance .",
    "up to twelve active sources may be required , but good quality cloaking is always possible by this method .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section [ prob_form ] includes the governing equations and the multipole representations of flexural waves near a coated inclusion .",
    "an illustration of resonance regimes and active cloaking by point sources is given in section [ membrane ] for the case of membrane waves , as a simple precursor to the more involved discussion necessary for flexural waves . in section [ flex_res ] , it is shown that active cloaking is still effective in resonance regimes at higher frequencies , as a result of the strategy described above of using an appropriate coating to move the inclusion resonances into the desired frequency range .",
    "a closed - form expression is given controlling the choice of inclusion and coating parameters , which delivers a zero monopole scattering coefficient .",
    "this generalises the classical result of konenkov @xcite to coated inclusions and active cloaking .",
    "the supplementary material gives a full analytic description of our cloaking method for both membranes and kirchhoff plates .",
    "the out - of - plane elastic displacement @xmath6 in a kirchhoff plate satisfies the equation of motion @xmath7 where @xmath8 represents active point sources placed in the exterior of the coated inclusion ; the explicit representation for @xmath9 and positioning of the point sources are discussed in section [ active_section ] .",
    "we note that the super / sub - script @xmath10 is to be replaced by @xmath11 or @xmath12 , depending on whether we are considering the inclusion , coating or exterior , respectively . in equation ( [ gov_eqn ] ) , @xmath13 is the biharmonic operator , a dot on the variable denotes the derivative with respect to time @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the mass density , @xmath16 is the thickness of the plate , @xmath17 is the corresponding region , @xmath18 $ ] is the flexural rigidity , with @xmath19 the young s modulus and @xmath20 the poisson s ratio of the corresponding elastic material .    assuming time - harmonic vibrations , that is @xmath21 , outside the support of the function @xmath8 the governing equation ( [ gov_eqn ] ) can be reduced to @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the spectral parameter .",

    "we note that in what follows @xmath52 denote the required matrices in block - diagonal form and @xmath53 are the associated matrices , with all these matrices being given in the supplementary material .",

    "the final step in the construction is to cascade via a matrix product the progression from the interface between the inclusion and the inner coating to the interface between the outer coating and the matrix , giving the explicit transfer matrix @xmath61 , which incorporates the interface conditions at both interfaces :    @xmath62    the transfer matrix @xmath61 can then be used to give the wave coefficients @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 in the exterior region in terms of the wave coefficients @xmath67 , @xmath68 in the inclusion region : @xmath69    the final step in this procedure is to eliminate the wave coefficients in the inclusion region to determine the @xmath70 scattering matrix @xmath71 which relates outgoing wave coefficients in the exterior region to incoming wave coefficients in the exterior region .",

    "we derive formally an algebraic system for the active source amplitudes , which are computed to make the required number of multipole coefficients vanish in the representation of the outgoing scattered field .    in order to find the total wave scattered from the coated inclusion , we identify two model problems illustrated in fig .",

    "the ultimate aim of this paper is to cloak an inclusion with a suitably designed coating from flexural waves in resonant regimes using active control sources . in such regimes ,",
    "a small change in frequency results in abrupt variations in scattering and thus it becomes important to eliminate frequency sensitivity of active sources . with this in mind , as a preliminary problem , it is instructive to study the interaction of flexural waves in a membrane containing a coated inclusion . this is because solutions to the biharmonic equation are superpositions of solutions to the helmholtz ( a mixture of propagating and evanescent waves ) and modified helmholtz equations ( all of which are evanescent waves ) .    in this section ,",
    "we give an illustrative example for active cloaking in resonant regimes in a membrane , where waves are governed by the helmholtz equation .",

    "we note that once the relation ( [ cienanrel ] ) is established , the coefficients @xmath138 associated with the coating , as well as the coefficient @xmath67 associated with the inclusion can be readily found ( see supplementary material ) .",
    "also note that the scattered field in this particular case can be represented as follows ( compare with ( [ wsc_monopole_dipole_general_simplified ] ) ) @xmath139      in the case of an inclusion with no coating it can be shown that formula ( [ cienanrel ] ) reduces to @xmath140 in particular , for the monopole term @xmath141 @xmath142 where @xmath143 are non - dimensional quantities ( considering a plane wave travelling in the @xmath28 direction as before , @xmath144 )",

    "[ foursources_platea ] , we present the field plot , where @xmath256 , and hence @xmath257 , the wavelength of the incident plane wave is evidently comparable with the diameter of the elastic inclusion .",
    "the geometrical and elastic parameters of the inclusion and the coating are the same as in fig .",
    "[ e0eflatplate ] .",
    "figure [ foursources_platea ] shows a non - negligible perturbation of the incident wave by the inclusion .",
    "as described in section [ algebsys ] , four active sources can be introduced to compensate for the action produced by the coated inclusion on the incident field . the symmetric configuration of sources , shown in fig .",
    "[ foursources_plateb ] , is used in the simulation , and the amplitudes of the active sources ( as outlined in section [ algebsys ] ) are derived in an explicit closed form ( see supplementary material ) . the cloaking with four sources , as in fig .",
    "[ foursources_plateb ] , is quite successful in compensating for the scattering by the coated inclusion for @xmath256 ; beyond this frequency four sources will no longer be adequate .    in the following section ,",
    "we introduce larger number of sources and demonstrate how the larger - order multipole terms can be suppressed in higher - frequency regimes .",
    "the multipole representation ( [ total_field ] ) for the total field is used to produce the numerical data discussed below .",
    "the sources are placed on the circle of radius @xmath258 , outside the coated inclusion , whose external radius is @xmath259 .",
    "the simulations are presented for the cases of @xmath260 , @xmath261 and @xmath262 sources , together with tabular data on the values of high - order multipole coefficients .    in fig .",
    "[ e0eflatwithsourcesplate ] , we present three cases corresponding to an incident plane wave scattered by a coated inclusion",
    ". the parameters of the coating are chosen to be the same as in the simulation depicted in figure [ e0eflatplate ] .",
    "the case when active sources are absent ( fig .",
    "[ e0eflatwithsourcesplate]a ) is compared with the two cases incorporating four and eight active sources , respectively .",
    "although the scattering pattern has been reduced , in this higher - frequency regime it is clear from fig .",
    "[ eneversusnplate ] that around twelve sources are required to make the significant multipole coefficients vanish .",
    "the required combination of twelve sources , with the amplitudes computed according to ( [ fourier_coeff_eqn ] ) is given in fig .",
    "[ e0eflatwithsourcesplatea ] , which shows exemplary quality of cloaking , with the scattered field being suppressed .",
    "it is also noted that figs .",
    "[ e0eflatwithsourcesplatea]a and [ e0eflatwithsourcesplatea]b use a different colour code scheme , so that the diagram ( a ) plots the field in the exterior of the ambient matrix only , while the diagrams ( b ) and ( c ) show the field in the inclusion , which also indicates the field localisation .    the data in table [ ogw_coeff_plates ] for multipole coefficients demonstrates that the core region of multipole orders runs from @xmath263 $ ] .",
    "our procedure reduces all the amplitudes of targeted orders to zero , while increasing the moduli of adjacent orders . by inspecting the amplitudes of orders @xmath264 for four sources and @xmath265 for eight sources",
    ", we can see that in both cases we have an insufficient number of sources for successful cloaking . for twelve sources , both the entries in table [ ogw_coeff_plates ] and the displacement field components shown in fig .",
    "[ e0eflatwithsourcesplatea ] confirm good quality cloaking .",
    "this paper has presented a novel idea of active cloaking for coated inclusions subjected to incident waves of frequencies ranging from zero up to higher frequency regimes , where the monopole term in the outgoing scattered field can be a rapidly varying function of frequency .",
    "the technique involves choosing the coating to diminish the frequency sensitivity of the scattering problem , and then applying active control sources .",
    "a comparison between the membrane waves and flexural waves in kirchhoff plates has revealed interesting connections for low frequencies . in particular , we have identified the cases when the flexural wave scattering is driven by the helmholtz waves . on the other hand , we have also identified important differences where the evanescent waves which are present in the expressions for the solutions to the fourth - order problem contribute significantly .",
    "the utility of the proposed algorithm is high , as the amplitudes of active sources are given in the explicit analytical form , and the accuracy of the cloaking of coated inclusions in resonant regimes has been well demonstrated .",
