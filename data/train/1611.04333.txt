    "devising methods for analyzing and predicting time series is currently considered one of the most important challenges in chaotic time - series analysis ( eg .",
    ", see refs .",
    "[ 1 - 3 ] ) . in general , chaotic behavior is observed in relation with nonlinear differential equations and maps on manifolds . _",
    "times series may be construed as being the projections of manifolds onto coordinate axes_. much work in nonlinear dynamics has focused on the building of appropriate model(s ) of the underlying physical process from a time series , with the objective of predicting the _ near - future _ behavior of dynamical systems .",
    "the first step in formulating predictive models is that of specifying / estimating a suitably parameterized nonlinear function of the observation .",
    "this is followed by estimating the parameters of this function .",
    "in general , prediction models are formulated on the basis of the systematic and accurate identification of a _ working hypothesis _ [ 4 ] .",
    "this hypothesis is represented by a set of parameters that form an ansatz .",
    "this paper obtains the coefficients of such an ansatz , which possess information about the data set(s ) , via recourse to a fisher information measure ( fim , hereafter ) based inference procedure .",
    "the leitmotif for obtaining the _ working hypothesis _ by employing an inference procedure is to formulate a prediction model , based on the famed embedding theorem of takens [ 5 , 6 ] .",
    "the conceptual sophistication underlying the takens theorem renders the prediction problem to become an instance of extrapolation .",
    "currently , some of the prominent prediction models based on information theory ( it , hereafter ) are : @xmath0 the framework of plastino et .",
    "al . [ 7 - 10 ] using the maximum entropy ( maxent , hereafter ) method of jaynes [ 11 ] , and @xmath1 the nonparametric models by principe et .",
    "al , ( eg . see [ 12 , 13 ] ) .    the work presented herein belongs to a class of models known as _ pseudo - inverse _ models , for reasons described in section 2 and 3 of this paper .",
    "such models have been successfully employed to forecasting tasks in a number of disciplines which include nonlinear dynamical systems [ 7 , 8 ] , financial data forecasting [ 8 ] , prediction of tonic - clonic epileptic seizures from real - time electroencephalogram ( eeg ) data [ 9 ] , and even fraud analysis ( the london interbank offered rate ( libor ) manipulations ) [ 10 ] .",
    "generally , predictive models are of two types , viz .",
    "_ global _ and _ local _ ( see for example ref .",
    "global models are based on training data collected from across the phase space . on the other hand , in local models ,",
    "the training is accomplished by measurements providing data lying in the immediate vicinity of a specific / localized region of the phase space .",
    "_ pseudo - inverse predictive models , including the one presented herein , are essentially global models which possess local characteristics _ [ 10 , 15 ] .",
    "time series prediction has its roots in the theory of optimal filtering by wiener [ 16 ] . in recent times ,",
    "forecasting of chaotic time series has hitherto largely utilized artificial neural networks ( ann s , hereafter ) and other learning paradigms .",
    "commencing from the seminal radial basis function model of casdagli [ 17 ] , some of the notable attempts to study chaotic time series comprise ( but are not limited to ) the time delayed neural network architectures [ 18 ] , recurrent ann s [ 19 ] , maximum entropy ann s [ 20 ] , and support vector machines [ 21 ] . within the perspective of physics - based models ,",
    "the works of crutchfield and mcnamara [ 22 ] and farmer and sidorowich [ 23 ] constitute some of the most prominent efforts .",
    "fim - based studies have recently been acquiring prominence across a spectrum of disciplines ranging from physics and biology to economics ( for eg . ,",
    "see [ 24 ] ) . the prediction model presented in this paper",
    "comprises of two phases : @xmath0 the modeling phase and @xmath1 the prediction phase .",
    "the task of the modeling phase is to obtain the coefficients of the ansatz that suitably parameterizes the nonlinear function of the observed time series ( see section 2 of this paper ) .",
    "this phase establishes the _ working hypothesis _ , and is accomplished with the assistance of the training data .",
    "the prediction phase then generates forecasts based on the set of coefficients obtained in the modeling phase .",
    "the leitmotif for the fim - based model employed in this paper is two - fold .",
    "first , it provides the framework to endow the modeling phase with a quantum mechanical ( qm , hereafter ) connotation .",
    "this is in accordance with wheeler s hypothesis of establishing an information - theoretical foundation for the fundamental theories of physics [ 25 ] , and is accomplished by recourse to the minimum fisher information ( mfi , hereafter ) principle of hber [ 26 , 27 ] .",
    "variational extremization of the fim subject to least squares constraints results in a sturm - liouville equation in a vector setting , hereinafter referred to as the time independent schrdinger - like equation .",
    "consequently , i ) the probability density function ( pdf , hereafter ) of the coefficients of the ansatz , and ii ) the constraint driven pseudo - inverse condition ( that yields the inferred estimate coefficients , fundamental for the _ working hypothesis _ ) , can be specified not only via gaussian ( maxwell - boltzmann ) pdf s [ which are _ equilibrium _ distributions ] , but also in terms of _ non - equilibrium _ distributions [ 24 , 28 - 30 ] , comprising of hermite - gauss polynomials .",
    "this greatly widens the scope of the works presented in refs .",
    "[ 7 - 10 ] , and is accomplished in this paper with the aid of the qm virial theorem [ 31 , 32 ] for normal distributions .",
    "note that in inference problems involving the fim , the gaussian pdf s are obtained as solutions to the lowest eigenvalue by solving the time - independent schrdinger - like equation in section 3 of this paper as an eigenvalue problem , and correspond to the _ ground state _ of the physical schrdinger wave equation ( swe , hereafter ) .",
    "further , the non - equilibrium pdf s correspond to the higher - order eigenvalue solutions of such swe , and are linked to _ excited states _ of the physical swe ( see , for eg . [ 33 , 34 ] ) . from a _",
    "practical _ perspective , this enables the performance of the modeling phase and the concomitant prediction phase to be systematically categorized in terms of an established physics - based framework .",
    "next , the reciprocity relations and the legendre transform structure ( lts , hereafter ) , together with the concomitant information theoretic relations for the fim , in a vector setting and for least squares constraints , are derived .",
    "prior studies have derived reciprocity relations and lts for the fim model [ 35 ] and have analyzed such relations [ 36 - 39 ] .",
    "recently , these works have been qualitatively extended to the case of the relative fisher information ( rfi , hereafter ) [ 40 - 42 ] by venkatesan and plastino by deriving the reciprocity relations and lts [ 43 ] . a connection between the celebrated hellmann - feynman theorem , the reciprocity relations , and lts for the rfi has been established in [ 44 ] , in addition with a unique inference procedure to obtain the energy eigenvalue without recourse to solving the time - independent schrdinger - like equation .",
    "these prior works differ from the analysis presented in this paper in two significant aspects - @xmath0 they treat the scalar case and @xmath1 the prior knowledge encoded in the observed data are introduced as constraints into the variational extremization procedure in the form of expectations of the powers of the scalar independent variable .",
    "the reciprocity relations and the lts for the time - independent schrdinger - like equation derived in this paper , despite possessing a vector form and least squares constraints , mathematically resemble those derived in [ 35 ] .",
    "this augurs well with regards to the possibility of translating the entire mathematical structure of thermodynamics into the fisher - based model presented in this paper .",
    "the distinctions in the reciprocity relations and lts derived in this paper vis -  - vis earlier referenced works [ 36 - 39 ] result in the information theoretic relations derived from these relations being qualitatively different from those obtained in the scalar case .",
    "this fact evidences the distinction between the results presented in this paper and those demonstrated in refs .",
    "[ 36 - 39 ] , based on physics and on systems theoretic [ 45 ] considerations . _ of interest is an expression that infers the fim of the modeling phase just in terms the observed data , hereafter referred to as the empirical fim_. such relation , which is a solution of a linear pde derived from the reciprocity relations together with the lts that infers the fim without recourse to the time - independent schrdinger - like equation , has no equivalent in the maxent model",
    ".    the goals of this paper are    * @xmath0 to provide an overview of the solution procedure .",
    "this is done in section 2 , * @xmath1 to : @xmath3 introduce the mfi principle in a vector setting and using least square constraints , @xmath4 derive a systematic procedure for the inference of exponential pdf s of the modeling phase with the aid of the qm virial theorem , and @xmath5 obtain the constraint driven pseudo - inverse condition that yields the estimate of the coefficients comprising the _ working hypothesis _ ( see section 2 of this paper ) by invoking the qm virial theorem .",
    "this three - fold objective is performed in section 3 .",
    "note that for normal pdf s the solutions of the mfi and maxent principles are known to coincide [ 24 , 46 ] .",
    "this paper focuses on the normal distribution to demonstrate that the results of the maxent model can be derived from qm considerations and interpreted within the framework of estimation theory , which is not possible within the ambit of the maxent framework , * @xmath2 to derive the reciprocity relations and the lts for the fim in a vector setting using square constraints , analyzing the concomitant information theoretic relations .",
    "the _ empircal fim _ is derived , and a preliminary analysis of its properties is performed .",
    "this is accomplished in section 4 , * @xmath6 to computationally demonstrate the efficacy of the prediction framework for the mackey - glass ( m - g , hereafter ) delay differential equation ( dde , hereafter ) [ 47 ] , for a 5 minute electrocardiogram ( ecg , hereafter ) segment of record 207 of the mit - beth israel deaconess hospital ( mit - bih , hereafter ) arrythmia database [ 48 ] ( considered to be one of the most challenging records in the mit - bih arrhythmia database ) for the modified lead ii ( mlii , hereafter ) , and for the single ecg signal in record cudb / cu02 of the around 8.5 minute creighton university ventricular tachyarrhythmia ( vta , hereafter ) database [ 49 ] .",
    "the ecg data are obtained from the physionet online repository [ 50 ] .",
    "this is demonstrated in section 5 of this paper .",
    "the leitmotif of this exercise is as follows .",
    "+   + an obvious practical advantage of the pseudo - inverse model presented in this paper over a least squares approach in ordinary euclidian space is that the former requires the moore - penrose pseudo - inverse [ 51 ] of the embedding matrix @xmath7 ( defined in section 2 of this paper ) and therefore , the estimate of the coefficients of the ansatz comprising the @xmath8 @xmath9 ( see sections 2 and 3 of this paper ) derived via inference from the training data .",
    "this can be achieved even when * w * is nearly singular .",
    "the fact that the estimates @xmath9 are defined even when * w * is singular ( or nearly singular ) can in principle result in very volatile forecasts , on account of ill - conditioning .",
    "note that ill - conditioning occur in the presence of a near - singular * w * , which in turn might occur if many lags of the observed data @xmath10 are present .",
    "+   + the leitmotif for the choice of the benchmarks on which to test the prediction model is as follows .",
    "the m - g equation with delay @xmath11 has a high embedding dimension [ 18 ] .",
    "thus * w * displays more lags as compared to most prominent models describing low dimensional chaos [ 3 , 14 ] . as is described in section 2 of this paper , the rationale being that the number of lags in * w * depends upon the embedding dimension .",
    "as evidenced in section 5 of this paper , the forecast of the m - g dde is stable and accurate .",
    "next , ecg s of patients suffering from serious cardiac related ailments possess artifacts which are representative of various conditions of a diseased heart .",
    "these artifacts are noted in the reference annotations as episodes ( transients ) . it is demonstrated that even for the most challenging cases , the model presented in this paper accurately forecasts these episodes without any signs of volatility , thereby demonstrating the accuracy and robustness of the pseudo - inverse model .",
    "this is established for cases where the original signal possesses highly erratic / volatile behavior .",
    "numerical examples for exemplary cases are provided . to the best of the authors knowledge , these objectives have never hitherto been accomplished .",
    "given a signal * x * from an unknown dynamical system @xmath12 , the corresponding time series consists of a sequence of @xmath13 _ stroboscopic _ measurements : @xmath14 made at intervals @xmath15 .",
    "the state space is reconstructed using the time delay embedding [ 1 , 5 , 6 ] , which uses a collection of coordinates with time lag to create a vector in @xmath16-dimensions , on a system considered to be in a state described by @xmath17 at discrete times @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the time lag , and @xmath16 is the embedding dimension of the reconstruction .",
    "it is known from takens theorem ( eg . see refs . [ 5 , 6 ] ) that for flows evolving to compact attracting manifolds of dimension @xmath20 ; if @xmath21 for the forecasting time @xmath22 , @xmath23 ( time samples in this paper ) , there exists a functional form of the type @xmath24 where @xmath25,\\ ] ] and @xmath26 .",
