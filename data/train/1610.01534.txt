    "the equations of motion of a test particle around a kerr black hole are fully integrable because of existence of four conservations : four - velocity , energy , angular momentum and the carter constant @xcite . in the strong gravitational field region ,",
    "due to two relativistic orbital precessions : perihelion and lense - thirring precessions which come from the curvature of space - time and frame - dragging respectively , the trajectories of the test particle are both symmetrical about the rotating axis and equatorial plane of the corresponding kerr black hole . in principle , even for the far zone from black holes , giving an enough time scale , all orbital configurations of test particles around kerr black holes have these two symmetries .",
    "though almost all astrophysical bodies have spin , in the region far away from the central massive body , for extreme mass - ratio cases , the motion of a small body can be described enough accurately with the test particle approximation .",
    "for example , the motions of s - stars around the supermassive black hole in our galactic center @xcite need not to consider the spins of them .",
    "however , in the strong field region and large spin , due to the spin - orbit and spin - spin interactions , the trajectories of a spinning particle in kerr space - time can deviate from geodesic obviously . not like the test particle case , for spinning particles ,",
    "because of absence of the carter constant , the equations of motion of spinning particles are no longer integrable .",
    "the influence of spin of the particle is important in dynamics and gravitational waves for extreme mass - ratio systems @xcite . for physical spin magnitude , the orbits are always regular .",
    "however , under some conditions , the orbital motions of extreme spinning particles can be chaotic @xcite ( and references inside ) .",
    "though such extreme spin value is unphysical , the phenomena and characteristics of spinning particle orbiting near a black hole are very interesting for researchers @xcite . in this paper , we focus on an exotic orbital configuration which the orbit is asymmetrical about the equatorial plane of the kerr black hole .",

    "the popular equations for describing the motion of a spinning particle in curved space - time are mathisson - papapetrou - dixion ( mpd ) equations @xcite , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the four - velocity of the spinning particle , @xmath7 the linear momentum , @xmath8 the anti - symmetrical spin tensor , and @xmath9 the riemann tensor of the background .",

    "following dixon , we choose @xmath15 as a spin supplementary condition which picks out a unique worldline that we identify as the center of mass . because of lack of enough conservations",
    ", there is no analytical solution for eqs.([mpdeq1 ] ,  [ mpdeq2 ] ) , and then numerical integration is used to calculate the motion of the spinning particle .",
    "we choose boyer - lindquist coordinates for calculations , and we should firstly give a set of initial data at time @xmath16 : @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "it is noted that one components of @xmath19 , two components of @xmath18 are not arbitrary , they must satisfy the constrains like @xmath20 ( s is the spin magnitude ) , and the spin supplementary condition as well as the energy and angular momentum conservations . at the end of numerical evolution , all these constrains must be checked again to make sure the calculations are accurate enough . during our simulations ,",
    "the relative errors of all these constrains are less than @xmath21 .    for simplification , firstly , we assume a spinning particle locating at the polar direction of the kerr black hole ( i.e. , @xmath22 ) . because of the bad behavior of boyer - lindguist coordinates at @xmath23 , we transfer the coordinates to cartesian - kerr - schild ones . in the cartesian",

    "<S> we report exotic orbital phenomena for the case of spinning particles orbiting around a kerr black hole , i.e. , some orbits of spinning particles are asymmetrical about the equatorial plane . when a test particle orbits around a kerr black hole in strong field region , due to the relativistic orbital precessions , the trajectories of this particle are symmetrical about the equatorial plane of the kerr black hole . </S>",
    "<S> however , in some certain orbital configurations and artificially large spins , the trajectories of the spinning particle are no longer symmetrical about the equatorial plane . </S>",
    "<S> these asymmetrical motions come from the spin - spin interactions ( papapetrou force ) between the spins of particle and black hole . by analyzing a spinning particle locating initially at the polar direction ( i.e. , z axis ) of the kerr black hole , we find that the spin - spin coupling with the certain spin orientation can produce a kind of `` counter - gravity '' comparing with the one produced by mass . in generic orbits , </S>",
    "<S> the direction of papapetrou force can be arbitrary , and can be asymmetrical about the equatorial plane . </S>",
    "<S> we conjecture that just the spin - spin coupling pushes the particle out of the equatorial plane in one direction , and then produce the asymmetrical orbits .    </S>",
