    "given a riemannian manifold @xmath0 , it is in general very hard to determine whether there exists a foliation of a compact manifold @xmath1 such that @xmath0 is quasi - isometric to one of the leaves equipped with the induced metric from @xmath1 .",
    "however , we can rule out certain riemannian manifolds .",
    "@xmath2-dimensional examples of non - leaves were given by attie and hurder @xcite , and zeghib @xcite modified their construction to produce @xmath3-dimensional non - leaves .",
    "schweitzer showed in 1994 @xcite that every open surface carries a metric of bounded geometry that can not be bi - lipschitz equivalent to a leaf in a foliation of a compact @xmath4-manifold , and in 2009 he was able to extend his results from dimension @xmath3 to any dimension @xcite .",
    "he showed that every non - compact manifold carries a metric of bounded geometry such that the resulting riemannian manifold can not be diffeomorphically quasi - isometric to a leaf in a codimension one foliation of a compact manifold .",

    "we give a brief description of the bounded homology property in section [ section : schweitzers bounded homology property ] , for more details we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "attie - hurder and zeghib use the so called _ geometric entropy _ of a metric space , a measure of the complexity of coverings of the space .",
    "the bounded homology property is specifically tailored to foliations and might at first be difficult to grasp .",
    "it is thus an interesting question whether the bounded homology property can be expressed through established quasi - isometry invariants .",
    "schweitzer s and zeghib s non - leaf constructions deform a metric on a riemannian manifold ( in schweitzer s case an arbitrary metric on an arbitrary manifold , in zeghib s case the hyperbolic metric on @xmath6 ) by inserting balloons of radius tending towards infinity .",
    "computing the coarse homology of the non - leaves , one notices that it is never finitely generated ( proposition [ prop : g_sj has infinitely generated coarse homology ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the bounded homology property and possibly other conditions on leaves might be expressible through the number of generators of the coarse homology .",
    "the only known non - leaf with finitely generated coarse homology is the @xmath2-dimensional example given by attie and hurder but no non - leaves with trivial coarse homology were known before .",

    "as we will now describe , the first question is to be answered in the negative while we can give a positive answer to the latter .    due to a connection between coarse homology and ends of manifolds",

    "this can be performed in such a way , that the new resulting metric @xmath12 on @xmath1 is smooth and again of bounded geometry . by placing the @xmath237 sufficiently far apart ,",
