    "although two - dimensional @xmath1 theory has a simple lagrangian , the spectrum of the theory has some very interesting behavior . even without the introduction of a negative bare - mass squared , the theory exhibits symmetry breaking at sufficiently strong coupling  @xcite , signaled by a degeneracy of the lowest massive states with the vacuum . here",
    "we consider a light - front hamiltonian calculation of the spectrum at and below this critical coupling and compare with previous calculations in both light - front  @xcite and equal - time quantization  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we explain why the two quantizations yield different results for the critical value of the bare dimensionless coupling .",
    "light - front quantization  @xcite is in general a convenient approach to the nonperturbative solution of quantum field theories  @xcite , and provides an alternative to lattice  @xcite and dyson  schwinger methods  @xcite .",
    "light - front coordinates  @xcite offer a clean separation between external and internal momenta , and the quantization can keep the vacuum trivial , so that it does not mix with the massive states .",
    "the wave functions of a fock - state expansion are then well defined and lay an intuitive foundation for calculation of observables directly in terms of matrix elements of operators . moreover ,",
    "the formulation is in minkowski space rather than the euclidean space of lattice gauge theory and dyson  schwinger equations .    in two dimensions ,",
    "light - front quantization uses a time coordinate @xmath2 and a spatial coordinate @xmath3 .",
    "the conjugate momentum variables are @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the fundamental eigenvalue problem for an eigenstate of mass @xmath6 is @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the light - front hamiltonian and @xmath9 is the total light - front momentum of the state .",
    "we solve this eigenvalue problem by expanding @xmath10 in a fock basis of momentum and particle - number eigenstates and then expanding the fock - space wave functions in terms of fully symmetric , multivariate polynomials  @xcite .",
    "the problem is made finite by truncation in both the fock - space and polynomial basis sets .",
    "the use of a polynomial basis for the wave functions has significant advantages over the more common discretized light - cone quantization ( dlcq ) approach  @xcite .",
    "one purpose of the present work is to illustrate this . in dlcq , which relies on a trapezoidal approximation to integral operators , endpoint corrections associated with zero modes  @xcite",
    "are normally dropped , which delays convergence , whereas a basis - function method can be tuned to keep the correct endpoint behavior of the wave functions . also , the discretization grid of dlcq forces a particular allocation of computational resources to each fock sector , without regard to the importance of one sector over another ; a basis - function approach allows the allocation to be adjusted sector by sector , to optimize computation resources with respect to convergence . the particular polynomial basis that we use",

    "the mode expansion for the field at zero light - front time is [ eq : mode ] ( x^+=0,x^-)= \\ { a(p)e^-ipx^-/2 + a^(p)e^ipx^-/2 } , where for convenience we have dropped the @xmath13 superscript and will from here on write light - front momenta such as @xmath14 as just @xmath15 .",

    "because the terms of @xmath8 change particle number by zero or by two , the eigenstates can be separated according to the oddness or evenness of the number of constituents .",
    "therefore , the first sum in ( [ eq : fsexpansion ] ) is restricted to odd or even @xmath17 .",
    "we will consider only the lowest mass eigenstate in each case , though the methods allow for calculation of higher states .",
    "the light - front hamiltonian eigenvalue problem @xmath23 reduces to a coupled set of integral equations for the fock - state wave functions : & & + & & + ( y_1-x_1-x_2-x_3)_m+2(x_1,x_2,x_3,y_2,  ,y_m ) + & & + _ m-2(y_1+y_2+y_3,y_4,  ,y_m)=_m(y_i ) .",
    "we have used the symmetry of @xmath22 to collect exchanged momenta in the leading arguments of the function , with appropriate @xmath17-dependent factors in front of each term .",

    "it is this set of equations that we solve numerically , as described in the appendix .",
    "our approach takes advantage of the new set of multivariate polynomials that is fully symmetric on the hypersurface @xmath25 defined by momentum conservation  @xcite .",
    "this allows independent tuning of resolutions in each fock sector , so that , unlike discrete light - cone quantization ( dlcq )  @xcite , sectors with lower net probability need not overtax computational resources .",
    "also , within each fock sector , the use of a polynomial basis has improved convergence compared to dlcq  @xcite , at least partly because dlcq misses contributions from zero modes  @xcite associated with integrable singularities at @xmath26 .",
    "in addition to calculation of the spectrum , it is possible to calculate the expectation value for the field @xmath27 when the odd and even states are degenerate . at degeneracy ,",
    "the two states mix , and the expectation value for @xmath27 comes from cross terms , the matrix element between the odd and even eigenstates . let @xmath28 be the state with an odd number of constituents , and @xmath29 be the state for an even number . at degeneracy , the eigenstate can be a linear combination of these , and the desired matrix element for the field is & & + & &    ' '' ''    ( y_1+p / p-1)e^i(p-p)x^-/2 _ m+1(y_j)_m(y_2, ... ,y_m+1 ) + & &    ' '' ''    + _ m _",

    "thus the expectation value depends upon zero modes  @xcite . in our basis function approach",
    ", the zero - momentum limit can be taken explicitly .",
    "one of the advantages of light - front quantization is the absence of vacuum - to - vacuum graphs  @xcite .",
    "however , to compare results found in equal - time quantization at equivalent values of the bare parameters in the lagrangian , this absence must be taken into account .",
    "in particular , the bare mass in @xmath0 theory is renormalized by tadpole contributions in equal - time quantization but not in light - front quantization , and the two different masses are related by  @xcite _",

    "the vacuum expectation values ( vev ) of @xmath32 resum the tadpole contributions ; the subscript _",
    "free _ indicates the vev with @xmath33 .",
    "this distinction between bare masses in the two quantizations implies that the dimensionless coupling @xmath34 is also not the same .",
    "estimates of the critical coupling must then be adjusted for the difference if they are to be compared .    of course ,",
    "if one compares results only for physical quantities , the two quantizations should match immediately . however , this is not straightforward in the case of the critical coupling , where the physical mass scale goes to zero .    with the tadpole contribution",
    "re - expressed as a vev , we can calculate the contribution in light - front quantization and avoid doing a second , equal - time calculation .",

    "the completeness of the eigenstates allows the introduction of the sum @xmath43 into the free vev , so that the difference can be written 0|::|0 - 0|::|0_free = _ n _ 0^ e^-ip^-/2 . with the change of variable @xmath44 and the introduction of a convergence factor @xmath45 ,",

    ", the eigenvalues must be positive because @xmath52 , as an overlap matrix between basis functions , is a symmetric positive - definite matrix . in practice",
    ", round - off errors can produce small negative eigenvalues ; however , unlike the ordinary factorization , this does not cause the svd factorization to fail .",
    "instead one can proceed with care .    to incorporate the presence of spurious negative singular values for @xmath52 , we write @xmath94 as @xmath95 , with @xmath96 the absolute value of @xmath94 and",
    "@xmath97 a diagonal matrix of the signs of the entries in @xmath94 .",
    "this allows us to define a new vector @xmath98 and a new matrix @xmath99 , such that the eigenvalue problem becomes an ordinary one : @xmath100 .",
    "the remaining complication is that @xmath101 is not symmetric ; it is however self - adjoint with respect to the indefinite metric defined by @xmath97 : @xmath102 . of course , for cases",
    "when @xmath97 is strictly positive , we have @xmath103 , and @xmath101 is symmetric . when not , we can use standard diagonalization for asymmetric matrices , which was found to work quite well .",
    "the convergence with respect to the highest order @xmath104 of polynomials in the basis was quite rapid .",
    "sample extrapolations are illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : m2extrap ] and [ fig : shiftextrap ] . to get a final number for the mass eigenvalues , for a given fock - space truncation",
    ", we performed a sequence of such extrapolations , varying the highest order in each fock sector . with the highest order in the lower sectors fixed ,",
    "the highest order in the top sector was varied and the results extrapolated .",
    "this was repeated for a range of highest orders in the next lower sector , with these results each extrapolated .",
    "this layer of extrapolations was again repeated , until a range of orders had been considered in every fock sector .",
    "the ranges considered were 10 - 15 in the three - body sector , 7 - 12 in the five body sector , 4 - 10 in the seven - body sector , 10 - 14 in the four - body sector , 6 - 9 in the six - body sector , and 4 - 9 in the eight - body sector , with the two - body sector fixed at a highest order of 20 . for the shift calculation , the fock - space truncation was at five constituents and extrapolation was done only in that sector , using a range of 7 - 12 , with the highest order in the three - body sector being 15 .",
    "lowest mass for the odd case as function of the reciprocal of the highest order @xmath104 of the polynomial included in the five - body fock sector , for @xmath105 , 1.0 , and 2.0 . in the three - body sector , the highest order was 15 , and the fock space was truncated at five constituents .",
    "the lines are linear fits extrapolated to infinite order .",
    ", width=566 ]      each extrapolation included an error estimate in the infinite - order intercept , and for all but the initial , top - level extrapolation , subsequent extrapolation was done with contributions weighted by their errors .",
    "the last extrapolation then yielded an overall error estimate for the final extrapolated value , and this was used for error bars in the plots of mass values . as the coupling approached the critical value , the errors grew , as would be expected , because higher fock states become more important for the calculation , leading to a greater dependence on the basis size in higher sectors .",
