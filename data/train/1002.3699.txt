    "the perfect theoretical description of these mechanisms would require to solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation for all electrons and all nuclear degrees of freedom . however , this ultimate attack exists only for very small systems , such as atoms @xcite , h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 @xcite . for larger systems ,",

    "in this section , we briefly represent the real - time method in tdlda - md . the molecule is described as a system composed of valence electrons and ions .",

    "the number of escaped electrons is defined as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a sufficiently large volume surrounding molecule .",
    "a detailed link with experiments is the probabilities @xmath38 of finding the excited molecule in one of the possible charge states @xmath39 to which they can ionize .",
    "the formula are deduced from the occupied numbers of the time - dependent single - particle orbitals and are taken from @xcite .",
    "fig .  [ structure ] shows the spatial structure of ethylene .",
    "the molecule is planar and we place it in the @xmath40-@xmath41 plane with two carbon atoms on the @xmath40 axis and four hydrogen atoms in @xmath40-@xmath41 plane .",
    "the center of mass is at the origin .",
    "the single - electron energies range from @xmath42 ev for the deepest bound valence level to the homo at @xmath43 ev .",
    "the latter is in good agreement with the experimental ionization potential ( ip ) of 11 ev  @xcite ( relative error of 4.5  % ) .",
    "similar errors are obtained when comparing the c - c and the c - h bond lengths ( 2.43 and 1.97 @xmath44 respectively , while the experimental values are 2.53 and 2.05 @xmath44  @xcite ) .",
    "[ opt_resp ] shows the optical response , i.e. the photo - absorption strength distribution , of c@xmath0h@xmath2 .",
    "it shows strong , isolated peaks at lower energies and changes to a continuum above the ip ( 11.5 ev ) .",
    "this result is consistent with former tdlda calculations  @xcite .",
    "the lowest peak is at 7.74 ev , in good agreement with previous ci calculations ( 7.76 ev  @xcite ) .",
    "we obtain the highest peak in the optical response lying at 8.16 ev .",
    "the frequency selective laser pulses will be sensitive to this much fluctuating spectrum while a collision with fast ions will deliver a broad spectrum of frequencies and will excite all modes at once .        to investigate the effect of the motion of the ionic centers of the molecule on the excitation dynamics , we compare , for the case of a laser excitation , calculations either with full ionic motion or with fixed ionic configuration .",
    "the laser intensity is @xmath45 w/@xmath46 and its full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) is 100 fs .",
    "we have chosen the laser frequency equal to 8.16 ev , that is the value of the highest peak in the optical response ( see fig .  [ opt_resp ] ) .",
    "we thus expect a resonant excitation of the ethylene .",
    "[ fig : ionic ] shows the time evolution of the @xmath40 ionic coordinates , the number of escaped electrons ( @xmath47 ) , and the dipole moment in the @xmath40 direction , @xmath48 , for moving and fixed ions .",
    "up to about 35 fs , no significant difference is visible in @xmath48 and @xmath49 . from then on , comparing both cases ,",
    "the dipole moments diverge rapidly in time and more complex pattern are observed for the case of moving ions .",
    "consequently , the total ionization also differs and more electronic emission is obtained when ions can move ( 0.8 additional electron is extracted ) . the ions precisely start to exhibit a sizeable motion at about 40 fs ( see top panel ) .",
    "the c - c bond oscillates ( see the open squares ) while the h ( close squares ) escape the system , due to the large charge .",
    "the non - adiabatic coupling between ions and electrons allows a feed - back of the ionic motion on the electronic response , as can be tracked on the dipole oscillations .",
    "the enhancement of ionization for the moving ions case is related to the expansion of the molecule . indeed , after increasing ionization , the optical spectrum is blue - shifted , so @xmath23 becomes smaller than the resonant frequency .",
    "however , the coulomb force from increased net charge impels the expansion of ions which red - shifts of the optical spectrum and allows @xmath23 to be in the region of resonance again .",
    "the difference of electronic emission above shows the importance of treating electronic and ionic dynamics simultaneously .      to explore in more detail the influence of the laser frequency , we consider two cases , namely @xmath50  ev , lying is in the resonant region , and @xmath51  ev which is off - resonant .",
    "both cases are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : freq ] in the left and the right columns respectively .",
    "the laser parameters are a polarization along @xmath40 axis , an intensity of @xmath52  w/@xmath46 , and a rather short fwhm of 20  fs .",
    "the bond lengths and the r.m.s .",
    "radii in the resonant case , top - left panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : freq ] , show much different dynamics for the various bonds .",
    "the c - h bonds grow quickly and monotonously , which means that the bonds are broken and hydrogen ions are flying apart in the @xmath53 plane .",
    "the c - c bond ( dark solid line ) , on the contrary , oscillates with a rather large amplitude during the whole time span .",
    "the off - resonant case , top - right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : freq ] , shows regular and faint oscillations for all bonds and r.m.s radii .",
    "the molecule remains unfragmented , although highly excited .",
    "the ionization @xmath54 and the dipole evolution shown in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : freq ] , corroborate these findings . in the off - resonant case ( right panels ) , the dipole nicely follows the laser field , producing an emission of 0.6 - 0.7 electron during the pulse duration .",
    "as soon as the laser is switched off , faint dipole oscillations remain and @xmath49 levels off .",
    "the resonant case visibly produces a complex pattern in the dipole evolution with large amplitudes ; more ionization is observed , driving the molecule above the limits of binding .",
    "note that @xmath47 starts to increase at around 5 fs while the ionic motion ( see the bond lengths ) follows later .",
    "ionization is directly caused by the laser pulse and electrons react quickly because they have a low mass .",
    "the ions react indirectly , namely to the coulomb pressure induced by ionization , and more slowly due to their larger mass .",
    "the above discussion demonstrates the versatility of a laser excitation when playing with its frequency ( at low intensities ) . indeed",
    "the value of this frequency plays an important role in the excitation dynamics of ethylene . in the resonant region",
    ", enhanced ionization often leads to a coulomb fragmentation of the molecule .",
    "we finally end with a typical example of collision between ethylene and a projectile with charge @xmath55 . the projectile moves along @xmath40 direction at the velocity of 20  @xmath44/fs , with an offset of @xmath56  @xmath44 in @xmath21 direction .",
    "the initial position of the projectile is ( @xmath57 , 0 , @xmath58 ) , thus safely far away from the ethylene .",
    "[ example ] displays the time evolution of the dipole moments in the three spatial directions , @xmath49 and the ionization probabilities @xmath59 .",
    "let us start with the dipole response after collision with the projectile ( top panel ) .",
    "since the projectile moves in the @xmath60 plane along the @xmath40 axis , no significant excitation along the @xmath41 direction is expected . and",
    "indeed , the dipole moment in that direction , @xmath61 , is vanishingly small . on the contrary , @xmath48 and @xmath62 exhibit at time of closest approach ( at about 5 fs ) an almost instantaneous large shift and",
    "quickly relaxe towards much more gentle oscillations that last for a long time .",
    "note that the shift in @xmath40 direction is higher than that in @xmath21 direction .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the extension of the electronic cloud is larger in @xmath40 than in @xmath21 directions ( see the ethylene configuration in fig .  [ structure ] ) .",
    "the total ionization , shown in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ example ] , evolves according to the dipole excitation  : it jumps almost immediately at impact time in correlation to the huge dipole moments , while the faint later dipole oscillations do not induce further electron emission .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ example ] shows the detailed ionization probabilities .",
    "their time evolution proceed similarly to that of @xmath49 .",
    "indeed @xmath63 falls down abruptly at the time of closest approach , while the other charge state probabilities grow very quickly .",
    "then all probabilities level off and no evolution in time is observed .",
    "the charge state @xmath64 has the largest probability in accordance with a net ionization of nearly 1 ( see middle panel ) , but a sizeable value of @xmath65 of 20  % is nevertheless attained . as for higher charge states ,",
    "their probabilities are negligible as expected .    at the side of the ions",
    ", this fast collision only induces a visible motion in the @xmath53 plane .",
    "more precisely , faint oscillations parallel to the @xmath40 axis of the c - c bond ( aligned with the @xmath40 axis ) are observed , while the c - h bond exhibit larger ( but still small ) oscillations , because of the smaller mass of the h compared with that of the c. in the @xmath41 direction , the c atoms simply do not move and the h gently oscillate around their equilibrium positions .",
    "apart from the different dipole responses , this collision case is close to the off - resonant laser excitation presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : freq ] , right column .",
    "indeed , the total ionization there is quite similar ( 0.7 compared with 0.9 here ) . however , the ethylene molecule seems able to cope such a ionization and remains in one piece .",
    "finally , we just mention here some other cases of projectile collision that we have explored .",
    "increasing the charge of the projectile can cause a direct coulomb fragmentation of the ethylene molecule .",
    "we have also varied the value and the direction of the impact parameter @xmath29 .",
    "when the projectile moves perpendicular to the ethylene plane , the electronic response is of course weaker , since the interaction time is shorter than in the case of a projectile moving parallel to the molecular plane .",
    "still the investifated test cases lead us to conclude that the dominant ( first order ) parameter is the actual ( absolute ) value of @xmath29 .",
    "in this paper , we have demonstrated the capability of tdlda - md to describe complex coupled ionic and electronic excitations .",
    "we discussed various excitation scenarios of ethylene subjected to different laser pulses and fast charged projectiles .",
    "these scenarios involve both electrons and ions but the relative role of each species does depend on the actual excitation conditions of the laser pulse and charged particles . the response in time of the electron cloud , such as dipole deformation , total number of escaped electrons and ionization probabilities have been presented .",
    "varying the laser frequency with fixed laser intensity and pulse length indicates that the appearance of de - excitation@xmath66explosion scenarios depends on the relationship of the laser frequency with the eigenfrequencies of the system .",
    "we have also explored the case of a projectile collision at moderate velocity , a situation that can be easily handled experimentally . a very fast excitation is reported .",
    "a systematic study of the dependence on charge , velocity and impact parameter of the projectile will be presented in a forthcoming publication .",
