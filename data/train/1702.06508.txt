    "cancer is a disease of multicellular regulation , in which malfunctioning cells can break free of homeostatic regulations imposed by the host environment @xcite .",
    "one of the main characteristics of cancer is the increased proliferation and mutation of tumorous cells due to malfunctioning control of growth and proliferation @xcite . as these behavioral changes typically originate from mutations in the cells genetic material , excessively proliferating cells accumulate further alterations , leading to a possible amplification of malignancies .",
    "traditional studies of altered cell traits primarily focus on genetic mutations , but neglect the multicellular nature and genetic variety of tumors .    tumor heterogeneity has been demonstrated experimentally and is an active field of research @xcite .",
    "neutral mutations may accumulate and contribute to intratumor heterogeneity @xcite .",
    "an intermediate level of heterogeneity is correlated with low survival probability @xcite .",
    "hetereogeneity may even be used to halt tumor development by inducing a `` feeder '' clone population that supports and enhances the growth of other clones @xcite .",
    "marusyk and colleagues @xcite claim that these `` feeder '' clones may be outcompeted by the more aggressive subpopulation , leading to the disappearance of the `` feeders '' and to the consequent collapse of the tumor .",
    "heterogeneity questions the validity of previous whole  tumor analyses , as ",
    "the most abundant cell type might not necessarily predict the properties of mixed populations \" @xcite , and emphasizes the need for more detailed approach .",
    "initial phases of tumor development are increasingly thought to give rise to a darwinian process @xcite , where individual cells compete for growth space and nutrients .",
    "selection is imposed by the microenvironment , a highly complex entity spanning several ranges in size from the endocrine regulation of the whole body down to the extracellular matrix ( ecm ) and neighboring cells . during cancer development",
    "this environment is changed due to change in the cellular component , and due to the tissue and organism level reactions to the tumor .",
    "intrinsic coupling between neighboring cells forms the basis of the plasticity - reciprocity model @xcite : as cells alter their behavior ( plasticity ) , their contribution to the local environment  ecm remodelling , nutrient uptake , adhesion molecule expression  changes . in turn",
    ", the changed environment imposes an altered selection on the cells ( reciprocity ) , creating a feedback between cells and their local microenvironment .",
    "this cascading change in behavior is reminiscent of the behavioral changes associated with stages of cancer development @xcite that was later described by the accumulation of mutations through which cells become increasingly malignant @xcite .",
    "although a strict sequence of mutations was not found , a general pattern was observed in the majority of cases @xcite , linking the macroscopic stages to the cell - level changes .",

    "basanta and co - workers studied how the combination of tumor treatments , p53 cancer vaccine and chemotherapy , can be optimized to yield the best results @xcite . in a similar study , sreemati datta an coworkers @xcite model tumor development with the inclusion of evolving mutation rates and",
    "show that the balance between inducing driver mutations and mutation rates plays a key role in tumor growth : at high mutation rates , genetic instability may counter tumor progression . combined with close experimental verification , marusyk and colleagues @xcite used a similar model to suggest that interactions among clones may lead to an overall collapse of tumor development .",
    "this approach is able to incorporate evolutionary games to help cope with the development of treatment resistance .",
    "such space - free models assume that all cells within the tumor are able to interact with all other cells directly , and are unable to deal with intra - tumor spatial heterogeneities .",
    "studies incorporating this spatial aspect have mostly worked with cellular automata ( ca ) models .",
    "for example , gerlee and colleagues were able to explain the ` go or grow ' hypothesis through the emergence of haptotaxis in their ca model @xcite .",
    "in a recent study , waclaw and colleagues @xcite used a ca model to show that cell motility together with cell turnover may prevent intratumor heterogeneity . of particular interest",
    "is the study of anderson and colleagues @xcite , where the evolution of a growing cell population and the effect of a heterogeneous environment is explored .",
    "they represent the tumor environment as a distribution of ecm molecules that serves as nutrient after degradation .",
    "cell evolution is modeled in the phenotype by selecting a set of cellular parameters ( matrix degradation rate , proliferation rate , etc . ) from a number of predefined phenotypes upon cell division .",
    "the new phenotype was either selected randomly or according to a predefined sequence going towards more aggressive behavior .",
    "the authors found that cells evolved into a similar , aggressive phenotype when applying the random mutation scheme .",
    "heterogeneity in the population was found to give rise to irregular tumor surface , whereas environmental heterogeneity ( heterogeneity in the ecm distribution ) reduced population heterogeneity and favored the most aggressive cell types .",
    "enderling and co - workers @xcite introduced the cancer stem cell ( csc ) hypothesis in a similar model by incorporating cells with unlimited proliferation potential ( cscs ) and cells with limited proliferation potential .",
    "they found that cell death induced by tumor therapy could lead to a more aggressive , proliferative tumor , as the cscs were no longer competing for space after the treatment . using a combination model of phenotype evolution and the csc hypothesis , sottoriva and",

    "one such model used in tumor modeling is the cellular potts model @xcite .",

    "a recent study reported the emergence of spatial stratification of tumors based on the evolution of adhesion molecule expression @xcite .",
    "a further line of models explore the effect of oxygenation of tumors @xcite in the light of chemotherapy @xcite .",
    "one common point in the above models is a sharp distinction between the tumor and the healthy tissue .",
    "while the tumor is described in a cell - based detail , the environment is usually presented as a continuum .",
    "these models implicitly assume that stromal cells surrounding the tumor do not participate in the development of the tumor , and that these cells are fundamentally different from the tumorous tissue .",
    "the transition between the stromal and tumorous cell states is neglected .",

    "stromal cells may apoptose or may be converted to the tumor cell type in the model .",
    "however , in this and the above models the phenotypes available for evolving cells are restricted to a small , discrete subset of all possibilities .",
    "furthermore , the nutrients are typically modeled as a single component , however , one signature of tumorous cells is the reduced oxygen consumption and increased glucose uptake . for this a more detailed nutrient description",
    "is required .",
    "another missing point in previous models is the temporal change in the larger environment , the nutrient supply .",
    "initial tumors experience a stable blood supply present in healthy tissues , that presents them with a relatively constant environment .",
    "in contrast , angiogenic tumors at a later stage develop neovasculature that is tortuous and leaky , presenting a fluctuating , unstable environment for the cells @xcite .",

    "the spatial differentiation of cell populations is somewhat similar to the spatial diversity in real tumors as described by alfarouk et al .",
    "@xcite . whereas alfarouk and colleagues describe two main habitat zones concentrically surrounding the blood vessel , we observe only one of the zones with high proliferation rates and a robust cellular outflow from near the nutrient source .",

    "this is shown by the distribution of phenotypic traits over time in each population ( fig .",
    "[ fig_segregation]d ) .",
    "this gives rise to independently evolving quasi - species - like populations within the tissue , and might be analogous to the observed heterogeneity in tumors .    in simulations with low but constant vessel blocking probabilities cells around a blocked source",

    "[ fig_segregation]e .",
    "the ability to detect and to move to a neighboring active source is crucial for the cells for survival , and therefore is expected to be selected for . in our model , cells can achieve this by evolving chemotaxis towards glucose or oxygen , or chemotaxis away from lactate .",

    "indeed in all of the conditions the combined chemotaxis is selected for . in simulations with lower blocking probabilities",
    "the combined chemotaxis has increasingly higher fluctuations due to the random selection introduced by the blocking and opening of the vessels , often leading to extinction as well .",
    "in this study we introduced a computational model to explore the evolution of tissue cells under specific conditions .",
    "selection in the model acts through physical constraints : limited growth space , and limited nutrient diffusion . selected cellular phenotype traits , such as cell rigidity or growth signal , are allowed to change (  mutate \" ) upon cell division in any direction with an equal probability within a given range .",
    "we show that in this symmetrical system the evolving population acquires a directionality in the parameter space that drives cells from a healthy ( homeostatic ) state to a more aggressively expansive phenotype .",
    "this acquired directionality is purely a result of competition among cells within the population .",
    "we found the progression of the population robust against changing the mutation rate and slightly less robust against changing the nutrient supply stability .",
    "the emergent progression is consistent with the previous finding of anderson and colleagues @xcite , who showed that a cellular automata based evolutionary model exhibits a shift towards malignant phenotypes , even when cells were allowed to chose one of 100 preset phenotypes . in comparison with the anderson study",
    ", cells in our model are allowed to change their phenotype in a continuous phenotype space .",
    "however , only small changes are allowed in our model .",
    "this choice lends more persistence to the clones in the population , since more mutation events are needed to diverge from an existing clone . as a result ,",
    "faster growing cells colonize the population by means of clonal expansion .",
    "local expansion in tumor growth models , similar to the clonal expansion observed in our model , has been described recently by waclaw and colleagues @xcite .",
    "their study focused on heterogeneity in passanger mutations while the probabilistically occurring driver mutations set the proliferation advantage .",
    "interestingly , in their model cell motility acts to blur intratumor heterogeneity by allowing proliferating cells to invade ` cell - free ' areas where further proliferation is not inhibited by other cancer cells . while this model is able to reproduce the clonal expansion features of tumors , it neglects the potential inhibitory effect of spatial constraint produced by the surrounding stromal tissue .",
    "earlier studies by other groups @xcite focused on the proliferation diversity in tumors , the cancer stem cell ( csc ) hypothesis , where two different cell types are present : one with unlimited proliferation potential ( stem cells ) , and one that is only allowed to divide a limited number of times ( non - stem cells ) .",
    "they show that this distinction is required to explain the experimentally observed tumor morphology , and interpret the tumor as a conglomerate of self - metastases @xcite .",
    "the emergent clonal expansion patterns in our model ( see fig .  [",
    "fig_segregation]b ) are reminiscent of these self - metastases , and are a result of the differential growth rates emerging from the competition for survival , rather than the genetically coded different proliferation potentials as in the csc models .",
    "our model suggests that slight differences of proliferation rates within the population are sufficient to generate the expansion patterns , as opposed to the sharp distinction between cancer stem cells and non - stem cells .    to our knowledge",
    ", previous models of tumor evolution did not consider tumor cell evolution within the context of a packed healthy tissue .",
    "to mimic this situation here we restrict the growing tumor to a confined space , making them a model of an in vivo system .",
    "the only restriction is internal , imposed by other tumor cells , and is playing an important role when studying the effects of treatment recovery in a tumor with a cancer stem cell population .",
    "when a large portion of cells is killed by therapy , the internal cells have access to growth space and are able to regrow the tumor .",
    "in other words : space limitation keeps the growth inhibited .    in previous models",
    "the in vitro analogy is strengthened further by the fact that the nutrient source is typically uniform , or is available in the environment in a dispersed fashion . in our model",
    "the cell population is confined in a limited ( periodic ) plane , and the cellular environment is not empty mimicking the confinement in live tissues .",
    "the source of nutrients are the blood vessels in our model , similar to the studies of shirinifard and colleagues @xcite and powathil and coworkers @xcite .",
    "blood vessels in our model are immobilized entities , vascular remodeling is not included .",
    "nutrient diffusion and utilization create a spatial gradient in the supplies which is translated into a differential growth pattern in the evolving population .",
    "this differential growth creates a collective flow of cells outwards from the sources ( fig .",
    "[ fig_segregation ] ) .    shortage of nutrients is another major constraint for tumor growth . to be able to describe hypoxia and an altered metabolic state of tumor cells , we model oxygen and glucose as the sources of energy needed for the cells to maintain and grow .",
    "we model cellular metabolism with two distinct modes : respiration and glycolysis .",
    "the energy need of cells is determined by an intrinsic growth signal , a cellular model parameter setting the cell cycle time , and is controlled by the expression levels of glucose transporters in the cell membrane .",
    "the mode of metabolism is determined by an internal hypoxia inducible factor ( @xmath34 in our model ) , that is controlled through the oxygen levels inside and around the cell and the reactive oxygen species ( ros ) within the cell .",
    "this factor determines the ratio of respiratory and fermentative modes of cellular metabolism in the model .",
    "we observed different stages of development during the time evolution of our model .",
    "these stages include the depletion of oxygen , leading to hypoxia , followed by the gradual depletion of glucose . during this later stage ,",
    "cells shift their metabolism towards aerobic glycolysis in order to keep up with their increasing need to grow .",
    "this results in the increase of extracellular oxygen levels . in spite of the oxygen level reaching its normal value , cells are unable to revert to full aerobic metabolism as the metabolic need grows higher due to competition . this behavior is similar to the warburg effect observed in cancer cells . in the model",
    "this is a consequence of the protective mechanism against too high intracellular levels of ros that limits the amount metabolic flux through the respiratory pathway .    in our model the aggressive phenotype analogous to cancer",
    "is a natural consequence of selection on the cell - level and random mutation .",
    "when selection pressure is applied on the tissue level ( in the form of fluctuating nutrient supplies ) the overall fitness of the cancerous population proves to be lower than that of the healthy population .",
    "cancerous cells create an insecure environment that is more sensitive to stress coming from outside the cell population .",
    "this theoretical exploratory study opens questions in how to best approach renormalization of the tumor vasculature . in the model ,",
    "healthy cells are able to withstand the irregularities in nutrient supply better than tumorous cells . based on this observation , it is tempting to speculate that irregularities of the tortuous tumor vasculature might serve a similar role in real tumor development .",
    "it is important to bear in mind that these results are based on a rudimentary model of tumor development .",
    "for example , cell - cycle regualtion is overly simplified in our model as opposed to the study of powathil and colleagues @xcite where it is in the focus of the study ; cells in our model lack an explicit way to store surplus  energy \" as opposed to the cumulative  health - factor \" of swat and co - workers @xcite representing the cells tolerance against starvation . due to its 2d nature ,",
    "our model is unable to account for the out of plane transport of nutrients or cells .",
    "however , using our quasi-2d model allows the study of several processes taking place in epithelial tissues , where most of the tumors arise .",
    "importantly , the implemented cellular metabolism is overly simplified to enable the exploration of the system . after the foundation of this model framework is set out , it could be expanded with more detailed intracellular metabolic networks , for example , using spatial dynamic flux - balance analysis ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "these multiscale models will lead to a tighter integration of computational and experimental work similar to the `` symbiotic '' approach described in a recent angiogenic sprouting study of cruys and colleagues @xcite .",
    "further future work includes the more thorough exploration of different mutation rates for different traits .",
    "one of the ultimate goals of computational systems biology is constructing a virtual tissue in order to predict efficient treatment of various diseases .",
    "this can be achieved by adding homeostatic mechanisms to the cell culture such as contact inhibition of growth , or introducing an internal energy storage as in the study of swat and colleagues @xcite .",
    "furthermore , inclusion of a dynamic angiogenesis model ( e.g.  @xcite ) might involve exploring the roles of different blood vessel placements , or implementing angiogenesis models already available in the same platform .",
    "finally , the system enables the measurement of fitness at different spatial levels and in different ( micro- and macro- ) environments which could serve as a basis for exploring evolutionary trade - offs in using computational simulations .",
    "in this study we introduce an unbiased evolutionary approach to studying the evolution of interacting tissue cells .",
    "the model includes localized source of nutrients ( oxygen , glucose ) and sink for intermediate metabolites ( represented by lactate in our model ) , and a simplified cellular metabolism including glycolysis and respiration .",
    "cells in the model are spatially confined and no explicit distinction is made between stromal or tumor cells .",
    "the model exhibits distinct stages of development with an emergent evolutionary drift towards rapid growth , high glucose consumption , and hypoxia .",
    "this is accompanied by a wartburg - effect , whereby cells become unable to return to respiratory metabolism even at high oxygen levels . in the expansion phase",
    "the tumor exhibits clonal expansion and eventually gives rise to homogeneous clone distribution around each nutrient source which then evolve independently later on .",
    "finally , we found that the emergent rapid growing population is highly sensitive to intermittent nutrient supply , such as caused by leaky tortous blood vessels .",
    "to investigate the above questions , we model a monolayer of cells using a modified cellular potts model ( cpm ) based on the compucell3d implementation @xcite which can be obtained from http://www.compucell3d.org .",
    "customized code for the simulations and example parameter and initial condition files can be found in .",
    "briefly , model cells maintain a controlled size while performing amoeboid - like cell motion .",
    "in our model cells metabolise glucose and oxygen using a mixture of lactic acid fermentation and cellular respiration , as described in more detail below . through metabolism",
    "the cells generate an abstract cellular energy that is used for cell maintenance and cell growth .",
    "if a cell reaches doubling size , it divides and the daughters change their phenotypic parameters with a fixed mutation probability per parameter ( fig .  [",
