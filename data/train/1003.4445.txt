    "the most probable reason of the very good coincidence is the existence of the phase island with the good qsaa at @xmath259 , just when the atmosphere is in standstill , consequently ( [ 1.102 ] ) is a good approximation because of @xmath260 .    the values @xmath261  pc , @xmath262 given by @xcite are very close to the present ones .",
    "however , some caution is appropriate because of the underestimated uncertainties in their derivation .",
    "their @xmath6 originates from using ( [ 1.102 ] ) , i.e. @xmath109 , uaa corresponding to line 3 in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "furthermore , because of the uncertain value of @xmath231 , @xmath263 is well possible .    in the bw method",
    ", the propagation of the error @xmath264 can be estimated from ( [ 2.202 ] ) as follows .",
    "typical radius changes of an rr star are @xmath265  km within @xmath266 .",
    "the error of the radius change is @xmath267  km , i.e.  @xmath268 .",
    "by @xmath269 , the final error will be @xmath270 .",
    "this considerably exceeds the error originating from the projection factor ( e.g. @xcite ) converting the observed radial velocity to pulsation velocity .",
    "furthermore , by ( [ 2.202 ] ) and ( [ 1.102 ] ) , the error @xmath270 propagates to an error @xmath271 .",
    "the lower limit of the magnitude averaged visual absolute brightness is @xmath272  mag if @xmath273  pc , while @xmath274  mag belong to the improbable values @xmath275  pc , respectively .",
    "observed colours and magnitudes of a spherically pulsating star have been compared with those of static kurucz model atmospheres to determine fundamental parameters of the star in the frame of the quasi - static atmosphere approximation .",
    "photometric and hydrodynamic conditions have been formulated for the validity of the quasi - static atmosphere approximation in spherically pulsating stars .    *",
    "the quasi - static atmosphere approximation has been generalized for a non - uniform , compressible atmosphere with radial velocity gradient .",
    "this is a step forward because the hitherto available uniform atmosphere approximation described the motion of the atmosphere by effective gravity and differentiating the sole parameter radius @xmath18 of optical depth zero with respect to time . *",
    "our combined photometric and hydrodynamic method uses the variation of effective gravity , angular radius , velocity , acceleration in the euler equation .",
    "the complete input of the euler equation has been derived from photometry and theoretical model atmospheres .",
    "spectroscopic and radial velocity observations were used neither explicitly nor implicitly .",
    "this is a definite advantage in comparison with the baade - wesselink method , because less observational efforts are needed to get the fundamental parameters and the problematic conversion of observed radial velocities to pulsation velocities is not necessary .",
    "* concerning the interpretation of multicolour photometry , the inputs are identical with those of the baade - wesselink method .",
    "the present refinements are the quantitative conditions whether photometry can or can not be interpreted by static model atmospheres . * firstly , the phases have been selected by the photometric conditions when the quasi - static atmosphere approximation is valid . secondly , in a number of these phases , the laws of mass and momentum conservation have been applied in euler formalism of hydrodynamics to determine mass and distance of the star from the motion of the atmospheric layers in the neighbourhood of zero optical depth .",
    "afterwards , it was checked whether the hydrodynamic condition of the quasi - static atmosphere approximation was satisfied in the used phases , i.e. phases that satisfied the photometric condition but violated the hydrodynamic condition had to be excluded . _ atmospheric dynamical mass _ seems to be an appropriate term to indicate that the mass has been derived by a method which is completely different from a mass derived by pulsation or evolution theories @xcite . * as a by - product , a variation procedure has been given for estimating atmospheric metallicity and interstellar reddening toward a star from @xmath7 photometry .",
    "this method was successfully applied for the non - variable comparison star bd + 67 708 , giving @xmath8=-0.77\\pm .03 $ ] , @xmath276 , @xmath222  rad , @xmath277 , @xmath224  k. * using the @xmath7 photometry of the high amplitude rrab star su dra , the following fundamental parameters have been found : @xmath278=-1.60\\pm .10,\\ ] ] @xmath279 @xmath280 @xmath281 @xmath282 @xmath283 @xmath284 @xmath218 and @xmath249 are approximate values , since they originate from averaging over the whole pulsation cycle containing phases in which the quasi - static atmosphere approximation is merely a first approximation . * the internal motions of the atmosphere with respect to zero optical depth",
    "have been found to be significant in comparison with velocities and accelerations derived from the uniform atmosphere approximation . from the internal motions of the atmosphere , some constraints have been sketched for converting observed radial velocities to pulsation and centre of mass velocities .",
    "estimations have been given for the error propagation in a baade - wesselink analysis .",
