    "the magnetic and electrical properties of perovskite manganites with the general formula ( @xmath6mno@xmath7 ( @xmath1 = rare earth elements and @xmath0 = sr and ca ) have been extensively investigated for the last decade @xcite . among the interesting features are the so - called colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) and metal - insulator ( mi ) transition accompanied by charge / orbital order ( co ) .",
    "it is now widely accepted that these enchanting phenomena are caused by the strong correlation / competition of multi - degrees of freedom , that is , spin , charge , orbital and lattice , which could be significantly influenced by the @xmath0-site randomness .",
    "recently we successfully synthesized the @xmath0-site ordered manganite @xmath1bamn@xmath2o@xmath3 and reported its structure and electromagnetic properties . as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ 1 ] , the most significant structural feature of @xmath1bamn@xmath2o@xmath3 is that the mno@xmath2 square sublattice is sandwiched by two types of rock - salt layers , @xmath1o and bao , with much different sizes and consequently the mno@xmath3 octahedron itself is distorted in a curious manner , in contrast to the rigid mno@xmath3 for the @xmath0-site disordered manganite ( @xmath8mno@xmath7 .",
    "this means that the structural and physical properties of @xmath1bamn@xmath2o@xmath3 can be no longer explained in terms of the basic structural distortion , the so - called tolerance factor @xmath9 , as in the @xmath0-site disordered manganites @xmath1@xmath4ba@xmath4mno@xmath5 .",
    "figure [ 2 ] shows the electronic phase diagram of @xmath1bamn@xmath2o@xmath3 expressed as a function of the ratio of ionic radius of the @xmath0-site cations , @xmath10@xmath11/@xmath10@xmath12 [ 3 ] . among possible combinations of @xmath1/ba ,",
    "the mismatch between @xmath1o and bao is the smallest in la / ba and the largest in y / ba .",
    "when @xmath13 is smaller than sm@xmath14 in ion size , the ce - type charge / orbital ordered state ( coi(ce ) ) with a new stacking variation along the @xmath15-axis is stabilized at the relatively high temperatures ( @xmath16 ) far above 300 k , which would be not only due to the absence of @xmath0-site randomness but also due to the tilt of mno@xmath3 octahedra as well as heavy distortions of mno@xmath3 octahedron [ 2 - 5 ] .",
    "especially @xmath1bamn@xmath2o@xmath3 ( @xmath1 = tb , dy , ho and y ) shows the structural transition above @xmath16 , which is possibly accompanied by the @xmath17 type orbital order [ 2,3,5 ] .",
    "therefore the orbital , charge and spin degrees of freedom is separated in these compounds . on the other hand , @xmath1bamn@xmath2o@xmath3 ( @xmath1 = la , pr and nd ) with relatively larger @xmath13 has no octahedral tilt and shows a transition from a paramagnetic metal ( pm ) to a ferromagnetic metal ( fm ) .",
    "the ground states for pr- and nd - compounds are @xmath0-type antiferromagnetic metal ( afm(a ) ) . in labamn@xmath2o@xmath3 , the antiferromagnetic ce - type charge and orbital ordered state ( afi(ce ) )",
    "coexists with fm as the ground state , which suggests that the electronic phase separation is not due to the @xmath0-site randomness but is intrinsic phenomenon for perovskite manganites .",

    "such discovery of novel structural and physical properties in the @xmath0-site ordered manganite @xmath1bamn@xmath2o@xmath3 has demanded new comprehension about perovskite manganese oxides .",
    "however the @xmath0-site disordered form with the same constituent elements is crucial for such comprehension , especially in order to study the effect of the @xmath0-site randomness at least qualitatively .",
    "we successfully synthesized the @xmath0-site disordered form @xmath1@xmath4ba@xmath4mno@xmath5 . in this paper , we report the structure and electromagnetic properties of @xmath1@xmath4ba@xmath4mno@xmath5 , and compare @xmath1@xmath4ba@xmath4mno@xmath5 with both @xmath1bamn@xmath2o@xmath3 and @xmath1@xmath4@xmath0@xmath4mno@xmath5 .",

    "annealing of @xmath1bamn@xmath2o@xmath3 under o@xmath2 gas at high temperatures results in insufficient @xmath1/ba solid - solution .",

    "the degree of @xmath1/ba solid - solution at the @xmath0-site was carefully checked by measuring the intensity of ( 00@xmath19)@xmath20 reflection indexed in the primitive cell . we concluded the perfect disorder or perfect solid solution of @xmath1/ba only in the case of the absence of ( 00@xmath19)@xmath20 reflection .",

[ 6 ] as the phase diagram . comparing with the phase diagrams of @xmath1@xmath4ba@xmath4mno@xmath5 and @xmath1bamn@xmath2o@xmath3 , the electronic states characteristic of perovskite manganites such as afm(a ) and coi(ce )",

    "these behaviors are not reversible in the magnetic field .",
    "the stepwise behaviors in the magnetization and resistivity were observed up to 4.9 k but they vanished dramatically at 5.0 k. similar behaviors were previously reported in pr@xmath4ca@xmath4mno@xmath5 doped with a few percent of other cations such as sc , ga or co on the mn site and were explained by an impurity induced - disorder , with the coexistence of several short - range afi(ce ) phases and small fm regions [ 14,15 ] .",

    "this is the first observation of ultrasharp magnetization and resistivity change in the nondoped system .",
    "a model based on ordinal two - phase mixture can not explain the behavior .",
    "for instance , the afi(ce ) phase in the coexistence with the fm phase is continuously converted to fm phase as observed in labamn@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "we have no explanation for such ultrasharp magnetization and resistivity change at present .",
