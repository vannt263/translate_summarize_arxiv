    "this paper is concerned with a detailed local analysis of the solution of the cauchy initial - value problem for the sine - gordon equation @xmath0 we will consider the number @xmath1 to be a small parameter . this type of scaling can be physically motivated in the situation that the sine - gordon equation is used to model the propagation of magnetic flux along superconducting josephson junctions @xcite .",
    "the sine - gordon equation can also be derived in the continuum limit as a model for an array of coaxial pendula with nearest - neighbor torsion coupling @xcite .",

    "@xmath2 if the initial data @xmath3 and @xmath4 are held fixed .",
    "as can be seen in figures  [ fig : exactplots4][fig : exactplots16 ] , the semiclassical dynamics apparently consists of well - defined ( asymptotically independent of @xmath5 ) spacetime regions containing oscillations on space and time scales proportional to @xmath5 but modulated over longer scales originating with the @xmath5-independent initial conditions . an important role is played by the @xmath6-parametrized curve @xmath7 in the phase portrait of the simple pendulum , and its relation to the separatrix curve @xmath8 .",
    "indeed , in the specific context of suitable initial data of _ pure impulse _ type , that is , for which @xmath9 , the following dichotomy has recently been established @xcite regarding the asymptotic behavior of the solution @xmath10 of for small time @xmath11 independent of @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath12 lies inside the separatrix , then @xmath10 is accurately modeled by a modulated train of superluminal librational waves ; but if @xmath12 lies outside the separatrix , then @xmath10 is instead accurately modeled by a modulated train of superluminal rotational waves . if @xmath13 is a point lying exactly on the separatrix curve , then the approximation theorems proved in @xcite fail to provide a uniform description of the asymptotic behavior of the solution @xmath10 near such @xmath6 .",
    "it is clear from plots of exact solutions shown in figures  [ fig : exactplots4][fig : exactplots16 ] that some essentially different asymptotic behavior is generated by separatrix crossings in the pure - impulse initial data .",
    "in particular , a different and more complicated kind of waveform than modulated traveling waves appears to spread in time away from specific points where separatrix crossings occur in the initial data .",
    "the coupled pendulum interpretation is useful here : if the pendula are all initially at rest in the gravitationally stable configuration and are given a spatially - localized initial impulse of sufficient strength , then some pendula have sufficient energy to rotate completely about the axis a number of times , while the pendula in the `` wings '' experience very little initial impulse and only have energy for small oscillatory motions near equilibrium ( so - called librational motion ) .",

    ". this will be the case unless @xmath23 , the condition allowing for nearby values of @xmath6 to correspond to topologically dissimilar orbits , leading to large relative displacements in @xmath24 over finite @xmath21 and causing @xmath25 to become very large very quickly .",

    "double - scaling limits_. perhaps the first time such a replacement was made rigorous was in the paper of baik , deift , and johansson @xcite , in which a certain double - scaling limit of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle is analyzed , and the authors construct a local parametrix by essentially truncating an analogue of the taylor expansion after the cubic term .",
    "of course such a truncation is not exact , so there are errors incurred in modeling the jump matrices by others having cubic exponents , and the effect of these errors must be carefully controlled .",
    "also , any artificial truncation of a taylor series can only be accurate if the local parametrix is constructed in a disk centered at the expansion point whose radius tends to zero at some rate tied to the large parameter in the problem .",
    "this fact further implies that estimates must be supplied for norms of singular integral operators that are independent of the moving contour and it also typically means that divergence of the outer parametrix near the expansion point can lead to a sub - optimal mismatch with the local parametrix , leading in turn to sub - optimal estimates of errors .",
    "a significant advance was made by claeys and kuijlaars in @xcite ( see in particular section 5.6 of that paper ) ; here the authors consider a similar double - scaling limit and take the approach of constructing a certain nontrivial conformal mapping @xmath529 of a fixed neighborhood of the expansion point to a neighborhood of the origin .",
    "the conformal mapping is more - or - less explicit , and it does not depend on the parameters ( analogues of @xmath6 and @xmath11 ) driving the system to criticality . however , the point is that in a full fixed neighborhood of the expansion point , the analogue of the function @xmath522 is represented exactly ( no truncation required ) as a cubic polynomial in @xmath530 .",
    "the difficulty that remains with this approach is that the coefficients of the cubic in @xmath530 actually depend on @xmath116 ( so in fact it is not really a cubic after all ) .",

    "confirming that such an approach actually provides a usable local parametrix requires exploiting _ a priori _ knowledge of the behavior of solutions of the nonlinear painlev - ii equation and its auxiliary linear differential equation .",
    "if this information is available in a convenient form , the approach of claeys and kuijlaars delivers a vast improvement over earlier methods because it really works in a neighborhood of fixed size centered at the expansion point where critical points coalesce at criticality .",
    "the technique advanced in @xcite has more recently been applied to problems of nonlinear wave theory as well ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "we choose instead to replace @xmath522 by a cubic in an exact way , an approach that provides all of the accuracy of the claeys - kuijlaars method but seems simpler and requires no _ a priori _ knowledge of the behavior of solutions of the local parametrix riemann - hilbert problem .",
    "the approach we are going to explain now has also been used recently to study a different kind of double - scaling limit for a matrix riemann - hilbert problem in @xcite . as part of a careful study of the asymptotic behavior of exponential integrals with exponent functions having coalescing critical points ( to generalize the steepest descent or saddle point method ) , chester , friedman , and ursell @xcite showed how to construct a substitution that rendered the exponent function in the integrand in the exact form of a cubic polynomial .",
    "their method applies in the current context to establish that , _ because the coefficient @xmath215 in the expansion of @xmath522 is strictly positive _ , there is a suitable choice of new spacetime coordinates @xmath531 and @xmath532 for which the relation @xmath533 defines an invertible conformal mapping @xmath534 between @xmath422 and @xmath535 that preserves the real axis , for @xmath36 near enough to criticality .",
