    "as is well known , s - wave superconductivity is possible even in highly disordered systems .",
    "examples are superconducting intermetalic alloys @xmath4such as @xmath5 , @xmath6@xcite@xmath7 , heavily doped cubic perovskites @xmath4such as @xmath8 with @xmath9@xmath7@xcite and chevrel phases @xmath4 such as @xmath10@xmath7.@xcite what lies beyond these initially surprising facts is anderson s theorem@xcite according to which pairing of time - reversed states leads to a finite gap @xmath11 in the density of states .",
    "namely , the one particle states involved in the pairing need not be eigenstates of any translation operators and hence both @xmath12 and @xmath13 are only weakly influenced by the disorder .",
    "the key assumptions required for anderson s theorem are @xmath14 non- magnetic scattering only @xmath4time reversal symmetry@xmath7 @xmath15 the self - consistent order parameter @xmath12 does not fluctuate from configuration to configuration .",
    "previously gyrffy _",
    "et al._@xcite examined the conditions for @xmath15 to hold , and found that spatial fluctuations in @xmath12 could be neglected provided that coherence length    @xmath16    is much greater than the lattice spacing , @xmath17 .",
    "anderson s theorem also follows from the classic theory of abrikosov and gorkov.@xcite their argument is based on perturbation theory and the proof requires that the real part of the self energy @xmath18 varies slowly near the fermi energy @xmath19.@xcite it turns out that this is equivalent to the condition @xmath20 in eq .  [ eq : coherent length ] .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to examine disordered s - wave superconductors for which the spatial fluctuations of @xmath12 can not be neglected .",
    "the results of an such inquiry will be important for narrow band or short coherence length superconductors where @xmath21 or @xmath22 , such as some of those mentioned above . in the work of gyrffy _",
    "et al._@xcite the order parameter fluctuations due to impurities were studied using a perturbative technique .",
    "zhitomirsky and walker@xcite also calculated corrections to @xmath13 beyond anderson s theorem due to order parameter fluctuations evaluated perturbatively . in the present paper",
    "the goal is to treat the spatially varying @xmath12 and charge density fully self - consistently within the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) , and hence allow for the case of arbitrarily strong @xmath12 or charge fluctuations .    in this regime",
    "a number of interesting new issues arise .",
    "for example ghosal _",
    "et al._@xcite showed that strong disorder scattering leads to strong spatial variations in @xmath12 , with the formation of superconducting islands where @xmath12 is large and other regions where @xmath12 is small .",
    "moreover , they found that the spectral gap persists even when @xmath12 is very small in large regions of the sample .",
    "by contrast it was argued by opperman@xcite and ziegler@xcite that order parameter fluctuations lead to a finite density of states within the gap .",
    "similarly , in the calculations of the non - self - consistent density of states by annett and goldenfeld@xcite an impurity _ band tail _ develops due to spatial fluctuations in @xmath12 , and eventually this leads to gap - less s - wave superconductivity .",
    "obviously the fluctuations in @xmath12 can arise either due to randomness in the single particle site energy , @xmath23 , at each atomic site , as in an alloy , or due to randomness in the attractive interaction potential , @xmath24 , as considered by litak and gyrffy.@xcite here we consider only the former case of alloy type disorder .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the spatially random , self - consistent order parameter and charge due to ab binary alloy type disorder .",
    "the on site energy is @xmath25 on a fraction c of lattice sites and @xmath26 on the fraction @xmath27 .",
    "the green functions are calculated using the coherent potential approximation@xmath28@xcite .",
    "this has been shown to be exact in the limit of infinite dimensions@xcite and to reproduce the results of the self - consistent born approximation for weak scattering @xmath29 where w is the bandwith @xmath7 and the self - consistent t - matrix approximation in the limit of low impurity concentration ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "we calculate the self - consistent a or b site order parameter @xmath31 and charge density @xmath32 .",
    "interestingly , we find that particle - hole symmetry leads to @xmath33 , and we show that anderson s theorem applies exactly in this case , even though @xmath22 or @xmath34 .",
    "a similar result was obtained previously for weak ( @xmath35 ) @xcite and strong @xmath36@xcite interactions , but only for the weak disorder limit . by contrast",
    "the result here is exact for both weak and strong scattering .",
    "evidently , this latter result implies that @xmath37 is not a necessary condition for anderson s theorem .",
    "furthermore in the extreme disorder limit @xmath38 ) we have a disorder induced band - splitting in the normal state .",
    "remarkably , if the chemical potential lies in the band gap there is a superconductor to insulator quantum phase transition at @xmath2 .",
    "if the chemical potential lies inside one of the split bands , the normal state is metalic but there are impurity states inside the superconducting gap .",
    "below , in section ii , we describe the model , and our cpa formalism and report our numerical results for the cases of weak @xmath39 and intermediate @xmath40 scattering . in section iii",
    "we show that the gap fluctuation vanishes in the case of particle - hole symmetry , whilst in section iv we argue that within cpa anderson s theorem is exact in this case .",
    "section v contain our results for the strong scattering @xmath41 case where we find a superconductor - insulator transition .",
    "we use an attractive u single band hubbard model defined by the hamiltonian :    @xmath42    where @xmath43 , @xmath44 are , respectively , the creation and annihilation operators of electrons with spin @xmath45 on the lattice site @xmath46 , @xmath47 is the local occupation number operator , @xmath48 is the chemical potential , and @xmath49 is the hopping integral from site @xmath46 to site @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath24 is the attractive pairing interaction at site i. in all of the numerical calculations shown below the interaction potential is @xmath51 . for other interaction strengths we found similar results .",
    "@xmath23 is the site diagonal random disorder potential which takes on values @xmath25 with probablity c and @xmath26 with probablity @xmath27 .    after applying the hartree - fock - gorkov ( hfg ) approximation to eq .",
    "[ eq : s - wavehamiltonian ] our task becomes a study of the gorkov equation : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the fourier transform , with respect to the complex - time variable @xmath54 , of the greens function @xmath55.the self - consistency conditions for the local order parameter and charge density are @xmath56 and @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a positive infinitesimal .",
    "the task at hand is to solve the above equations for each configuration @xmath59 of the site energy and pairing interaction , to obtain the local order parameter and charge @xmath60 and hence to calculate the configurationally averaged greens function @xmath61 .",
    "whilst most of the salient features of disordered superconductors are well described by the abrikosov and gorkov(ag)@xcite theory , recently the cpa has also been brought to bear on the problem.@xcite within the cpa one replaces the on site random potential with a site independent self - energy matrix @xmath62 which is determined by the condition that an a or b impurity , corresponding to @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively does not scatter on the average .",
    "thus the average green function is given by    @xmath63    in the previous application of the cpa to the above model@xcite the condition which determined @xmath64 was implemented under the assumption that the pairing potential @xmath65 does not fluctuate with the site energies .",
    "therefore the self - consistency conditions ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : local order parameter ] ,  [ eq : s wave charge density ] ) were satisfied only on average . however , this presumption is not a necessary part of the cpa and , as will be seen presently , is unduely restrictive . here , we consider the more general case where on an a or b site , with site energy @xmath25 or @xmath26 , the pairing potential is allowed to be @xmath66 or @xmath67 respectively and the two local gaps , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , are determined by the condition that the corresponding local gap equations ( eq .",
    "[ eq : local order parameter ] ) are separately satisfied .",
    "thus if the probability that a site is occupied by an a atom is c and that for a b atom is @xmath27 the generalized cpa condition is @xmath68 where the single site t - matrices , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , are given by @xmath71 in terms of the local , single site , scattering potential matrix @xmath72 for @xmath73 .",
    "note that in the above expression not only @xmath23 and @xmath65 are allowed to fluctuate but the local @xmath74 also take on different values on a and b sites .",
    "evidently , such variations arise from charge fluctuations . in the present hfg approximation",
    "this is described by    @xmath75    clearly , once the above cpa problem has been solved for a set of @xmath76 and @xmath77 self - consistency requires that they are recalculated using the relations    @xmath78    @xmath79    where @xmath80 is the greens function matrix averaged over all configurations with an a or b atom , respectively , on the site i. in our calculation we assume , the non - magnetic case , that @xmath81 , and hence    @xmath82    moreover , the patially averaged green functions @xmath80 are approximated by the green function for a or b impurity in the cpa effective lattice described by the self - energy @xmath64 .",
    "they are given by    @xmath83    in short , equations @xmath84 fully specify a self - consistent procedure , which when carried to convergence , constitutes the complete cpa for disordered superconductors , in the hfg approximation , for the model hamiltonian in eq .",
    "[ eq : s - wavehamiltonian ] .",
    "note that since the cpa is the mean field theory of disorder and the hfg approximation is that for superconductivity , the above theory should be regarded as the mean field theory which treats disorder and electron interaction simultaneously and on an equal footing . by treating the self - consistency only on average , earlier",
    "works@xcite did not include the effects of fluctuations in @xmath12 and @xmath85 .",
    "previously the full cpa was only implemented to determine the influence of @xmath65 fluctuation on @xmath13.@xcite in the remainder of this paper we investigate the full consequences of treating interaction and disorder together on the basis of eqs .",
    "@xmath84 .",
    "our results for the gap and charge fluctuations as functions of the average band filling @xmath86 are shown in figs.@xmath87 and @xmath88 . to simplify matters we used a @xmath89 square lattice with lattice constant @xmath90 and band energy    @xmath91",
    "where t is the nearest neighbour hopping amplitude .",
    "in these calculations we have taken the energy difference @xmath92 to be a significant fraction of the bandwidth @xmath93 @xmath94 and hence we are in the fairly strong scattering regime @xmath4 for @xmath95 .",
    "as fig.@xmath87 shows @xmath96 except at the point @xmath97 , namely a half filled band . clearly from fig.@xmath88 @xmath98 at any filling except @xmath99 or @xmath88",
    "thus , unlike in previous calculations@xcite the @xmath12 and @xmath85 fluctuations are central features of our results .",
    "for emphasis we show in fig.@xmath100 the standard deviations of the order parameter    @xmath101    and charge density @xmath102 as predicted by our cpa calculations .",
    "remarkably , at half filling the fluctuations in the pairing potential go to zero , whilst the charge density fluctuations are at their strongest .",
    "to investigate the origin of this interesting phenomena we studied the case where @xmath103 but the band is still half filled at @xmath97 .",
    "for this case @xmath0 and @xmath104 are shown in fig.@xmath105 as a function of temperature .",
    "evidently for all @xmath106 , @xmath107 and hence @xmath108 . in what follows we unravel the root cause of this behavior .",
    "recall that in figs.@xmath109 the order parameter fluctuations vanish , @xmath33 , for the case @xmath97 and @xmath110 , namely equal concentrations of a and b atoms .",
    "this special case is one where the fermi energy is at the center of the band and the density of states is symmetric , and hence particle - hole symmetry occurs . for this case and only this case @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "furthermore , since the self - energy always obey the same symmetries as the green functions    @xmath114    for particle - hole symmetry there is also the property that    @xmath115    namely ,    @xmath116    and consequently @xmath117    noting that the cpa respects these symmetries we can rewrite the cpa condition in eq .",
    "[ eq : cpa condition ] , as @xmath118 combining this with particle - hole symmetry as described by eqs .",
    "[ eq : sigma symmetry ] ,  [ eq : sig - p - h ] ,  [ eq : relsigma ] ,  [ eq : realgreen ] implies that    @xmath119    and hence , since the second bracket is non - zero , that    @xmath120    therefore particle - hole symmetry implies the absence of the order parameter fluctuations .",
    "in non - magnetic disordered local s - wave superconductors the traditional argument leading to anderson s theorem assumes that the fluctuations of the order parameter are negligible , @xmath121 .",
    "anderson s theorem shows that in this case there are no bound states between quasi - particles and impurity sites and therefore the quasi - particle energy gap is absolute .",
    "namely , there are no impurity states inside of the gap.@xcite furthermore @xmath13 is found simply by replacing , the clean system density of states @xmath122 , with its disordered system average @xmath123 in the gap equation .    in an alternative route to the same result abrikosov and gorkov@xcite use perturbation theory which implies that the self - energy can be approximated by    @xmath124    where @xmath54 is a wave vector and frequency independent quasi - particle life time .",
    "this is justified in the case of the non - self - consistent born approximation by the assumption that the relevant energy scale is @xmath125 @xmath126 is debeye frequncy@xmath7 and hence only states near the fermi surface are relevant .",
    "more implicitly it is assumed that near the fermi surface the density of states is a constant and hence there is effectively particle - hole symmetry .",
    "however in general we can not assume that @xmath127 is of this form .",
    "in the case of narrow band superconductors , there is no debeye cut off and so one can not assume that only states near the fermi level are significant .",
    "in particular @xmath128 will not be a constant , and @xmath129 need not be zero . nevertheless ,",
    "if for some reason particle - hole symmetry is obeyed , anderson s theorem will obtain in full cpa , self - consistent born , and t - matrix approximations .    in figs.@xmath130 and @xmath131",
    "we illustrate using our explicit calculation the energy dependence of @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 for the cases of particle - hole symetric or nonsymmetric cases .",
    "note that function @xmath136 is defined by    @xmath137    and @xmath136 is the analytical continuation of @xmath129 to the real axis . figs.@xmath130 and @xmath131 show that for particle - hole symmetry , @xmath97 and @xmath110 , @xmath136 is equal to zero but in other cases @xmath138 .",
    "we shall now analyze the consequences of the particle - hole symmetry @xmath139 .",
    "the green function for cpa , self - consistent born or t - matrix approximations can be written in the form @xmath140 where the renormalized parameters @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 and @xmath144 are given by @xmath145 note that these renormalized parameters are the same as in the original paper of abrikosov and gorkov@xcite , where @xmath64 was computed in the non - self - consistent born approximation .",
    "they found that @xmath146 near the fermi surface is independents of @xmath147 , and therefore eventually it can be absorbed into the chemical potential .",
    "the same procedure was followed martin et al",
    ".. @xcite    however we proceed without these simplifications and retain the full energy dependence of @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "now , particle - hole symmetry implies that @xmath148 , and therefore @xmath149 . using the above relations the gap equation becomes    @xmath150    where @xmath151 and , @xmath152 is the renormalized band energy .",
    "surprisingly in the case of particle - hole symmetry the quantity @xmath153 in eq .",
    "[ eq : anderson ] becomes equal to the disorder average normal state density of states , namely , @xmath154 and hence , without further assumptions , anderson s theorem obtains . to be",
    "quick and explicit we note that this last step follows from the property of a delta function that @xmath155 , and hence @xmath156 in short , we again have anderson s theorem that @xmath157 is given by the usual gap equation , but with the disorder average normal density of states .",
    "however , unlike other proofs , ours does not neglect the energy dependence of @xmath132 or @xmath133 .",
    "one of the main virtues of the cpa in the normal state is the fact that it describes band splitting correctly.@xcite namely , for @xmath158 less than the bandwidth , @xmath159 in our case , it predicts an effective band somewhere in between the bands of pure a or pure b metal , whilst for @xmath158 bigger than the half bandwidth cpa predicts two , smeared , but nevertheless well defined , bands seperated by a gap .",
    "the two bands are at energies where there would have been an a or b band in one of the pure systems . in this later case the wave function corresponding to the a band",
    "is large mainly on the a sites and that in the b band is significant only on the b sites .",
    "in what follows we shall investigate superconductivity in this split band regime of cpa .    to investigate the consequences for superconductivity in the above split band regime we have solved eq.6 - 15 using a strong scattering potential @xmath160 . from these solutions two interesting points emerged .",
    "firstly we found that for the particle - hole symmetric case , reported in fig.@xmath161 , @xmath33 and hence even in this strong scattering state there are no fluctuations in @xmath12 .",
    "nevertheless , scattering has a large effect on the superconductivity through the configurationally average density of states @xmath123 in the eq .",
    "[ eq : average density of state ] .",
    "namely as shown in fig.@xmath161 @xmath162 for the critical strength of scattering @xmath163 .    the other interesting phenomenon is a superconductor to insulator transition .",
    "recently scalettar , trivedi and huscroft@xcite discovered a superconductor - insulator transition in the disordered attractive u hubbard model , using monte corlo simulations .",
    "they found that for strong disorder the superconducting gap is replaced by an insulating gap , both for weak and strong interaction u. clearly the superconductor to insulator transition in our cpa calculaton has a similar origin , although our model of disorder is different .",
    "in general the band filling @xmath86 is given by    @xmath164    where @xmath165 and @xmath77 are the partial averaged occupation numbers on a or b sites respectively .",
    "we shall discuss three different cases of eq .",
    "[ eq : filling ] : case @xmath14 @xmath166 , case @xmath15 @xmath167 and case @xmath168 @xmath169 . in the first case",
    "the a band is empty and the filling of the b band@xmath170 is    @xmath171    for the second case the b band is completely , doubly , occupied and the a band completly empty.in the third case the a band is partially occupied with    @xmath172    and the b band is fully occupied .",
    "the second case is a special case of eq .",
    "[ eq : afilling ] .",
    "fig.@xmath173 shows the a , b and average normal density of states for these three different concentrations . in fig.@xmath174",
    "the a sites are approximately empty @xmath175 but there is more than one electron on the b sites .",
    "the graph plotted was for the case @xmath97 and @xmath176 , and therefore from eq .",
    "[ eq : bfilling ] we have @xmath177 .",
    "fig.@xmath174 is a band metal with hopping of electrons from the b sites to the b sites . in fig.@xmath178",
    "the a sites are almost completely empty , @xmath179 , and the b sites are doubly occupied , @xmath180 .",
    "therefore there is a gap at the fermi energy and the system is a band insulator . in fig.@xmath181",
    "the b band is fully occupied while the a band is partially filled . for this case",
    "we had @xmath97 and @xmath182 and so by eq .",
    "[ eq : afilling ] , the band filling of the a sites is @xmath183 .",
    "similarly fig.@xmath181 is a metal band with hopping from the a sites to the a sites . in fig.@xmath178",
    "there is no hopping and we can regard this state as a band insulator .    as illustrated in fig.@xmath184 , in the split band regime the superconductor gap closes,@xmath185 as @xmath186 but is replaced by an insulating gap for @xmath187 . evidently , this can also happen in the non particle - hole symmetric case as shown in fig.@xmath188 .",
    "the general condition for the superconductor - insulator transition is saturation of the b sites with @xmath88 electrons of opposite spin while the a sites are empty .",
    "this happens when    @xmath189    in this case the fermi level lies in the gap and all the b states are filled and the a states are empty . for completeness",
    "we show the suppression of @xmath104 by disorder for particle - hole symmetric and non particle - hole symmetric cases in fig.@xmath190 , obeying the condition from eq .",
    "[ eq : transition ] .",
    "now numerically we shall test our prediction , in eqs .",
    "[ eq : afilling ] ,  [ eq : bfilling ] , for the two non - particle - hole symmetric cases:@xmath191 and @xmath192 , as discussed at the beginning of this section . in this cases",
    "there is no superconductor - insulator transition . for a greater understanding of the details of the band splitting mechanism",
    "we plot the density of states , the order parameter and the charge density on a and b sites . in the first case",
    "the concentration of a sites is less than b sites , but in the second case the concentration of a sites is more than of b sites .",
    "as expected , in fig.@xmath193 we see that there are two split bands , a normal empty band on the a sites and a superconducting band on b sites .",
    "conversely in fig.@xmath194 the b band is a normal doubly occupied band and the a band is the superconducting band .",
    "the effect of disorder on the average order parameter and the a and b sites local order parameters @xmath195 and charge densities @xmath196 are shown in figs.@xmath197 and fig.@xmath198 .",
    "one can see that , for weak scattering the local order parameters and charge densities of a and b sites are approximatly the same but with increasing disorder the difference between them will increase , with one of @xmath66 or @xmath67 going to zero@xmath4depending on the relative concentrations@xmath7 . in fig.@xmath199 and fig.@xmath200 the concentration of a sites is less than that of b sites therefore @xmath201 , @xmath202 while @xmath203 , @xmath204 .",
    "in contrast to this , in fig.@xmath205 and fig.@xmath206 the concentration of a sites is more than that of b sites , consequently @xmath207 , @xmath208 and @xmath209 , @xmath210 .",
    "schematically fig.@xmath211 shows the physical mechanism of the band splitting in terms of a and b lattice sites .",
    "clearly when all b sites become doubley occupied and all the a sites become empty there is no hopping and the system becomes insulating .",
    "therefore as a function of the disorder , @xmath212 , or band filling @xmath86 there is a @xmath2 superconductor - insulator quantum phase transition .",
    "this transition corroborates the suggestion of scalettar , trivedi and huscroft@xcite that disorder in superconductors can lead to a superconductor - insulator transition .",
    "however it shuld be noted that they used a uniform random distribution of site energies , @xmath23 , wheras we used a binary alloy model .",
    "in this paper , for the first time , we applied the full cpa for disorder superconductors . in our calculations",
    "the self - consistency equations were solved fully within cpa so that self - consitency was properly satisfied on each type of cpa impurity sites , and not just on the average .",
    "it is in this form that the cpa - hfg is the only ` controled ' mean field theory of disordered superconductors.@xcite    we plotted the local order parameter and charge density of a or b atoms of a binary alloy for both weak and strong scattering limits .",
    "we found that only for one special case are the order parameters of a and b sites equal , and consequently the fluctuations of @xmath12 are zero .",
    "for this point we have shown analytically that the condition for anderson s theorem is fullfilled not only for weak scattering but also for strong scattering in a particle - hole symmetric band .",
    "by contrast neither , the density of states nor @xmath13 is exactly constant , although in the gap equation , the quasi - particle energy gap is absolute . in the gap equation the normal clean system density of states in the gap equation",
    "is replaced by the normal disorder average density of states , and therefore the only changes of the superconducting density of states and @xmath13 come from the latter .    in narrow band binary alloy s - wave superconductors , we showed that strong disorder leads to two different interesting phenomena : @xmath14 band splitting with a quantum superconductor - insulator phase transition at @xmath2 , @xmath15 band splitting without a phase transition . in this last case in terms of concentration and average band filling , one band is normal @xmath4doubly occupied or empty@xmath7 and superconductivity is only present in the another band that is partially occupied .",
