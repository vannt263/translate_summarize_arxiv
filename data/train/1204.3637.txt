    "ref .  [ ] proposed a 1d spinless @xmath2-wave superconductor as a platform for end - state majorana fermions and topological quantum computation ( see also ref .  [ ] ) .",
    "it has been shown that a dimensionally reduced 1d version of a recently proposed 2d rashba - coupled semiconductor heterostructure @xcite can realize such a system for experimental investigations @xcite .",
    "the 1d system has the advantage that the minimum excitation gap above the end - state mfs , the so - called minigap , scales with the induced quasiparticle gap @xmath3 k in the nanowire .",
    "such a large minigap ( compared with @xmath4k in 2d ts systems @xcite , for example , in sr@xmath5ruo@xmath6 , a potential chiral p - wave topological superconductor @xcite ) allows the realization of the pristine ts state and mfs at experimentally accessible temperatures by applying a strong zeeman field .",
    "it has been shown by explicit calculations @xcite that the end - state mfs thus produced can be probed in local tunneling experiments that evince a zero - bias conductance peak .",
    "[ ] , which independently proposed the 1d structure , and ref .",
    "[ ] proposed an ac - josephson experiment to probe the nanowire mfs . an alternative direct way of having a large minigap in a ts system is to use a 2d hybrid semiconductor - superconductor structure @xcite with a very small fermi energy in the semiconductor so that the 2d minigap , i.e. @xmath7 , is intrinsically large .",
    "the basic idea behind the dimensional reduction of the 2d structure and the associated minigap is as follows @xcite : the 2d @xmath8-plane rashba - coupled semiconductor in the ts state supports a single gapless chiral majorana edge mode with dispersion @xmath9 on an edge parallel to , say , the @xmath10-axis . from the mathematical equivalence , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) hamiltonian of a wire along the @xmath13-axis",
    ", it immediately follows that a 1d nanowire along @xmath13 must have a zero energy mf eigen - solution localized at the end ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "for minigap , note that the 2d hamiltonian has no other eigen - solution on the edge other than the gapless majorana mode itself .",
    "this implies that the dimensionally reduced 1d hamiltonian should also have no other sub - gap solution other than the zero energy state at the end .",
    "hence , the minigap in the 1d problem should really be equal to the quasiparticle gap @xmath0 induced in the nanowire .",
    "viewed another way , in going from the 2d plane to the 1d wire , as the width @xmath15 in the @xmath10-direction is reduced , the energies of the quantized edge modes scale as @xmath16 , i.e. as the inverse of the confinement size of the wire in the transverse direction  we are assuming here that the size of the wire in the third @xmath17-direction is much smaller than that in the @xmath10-direction , but what matters is simply the transverse confinement size being very small compared with the length of the wire . since",
    "this quantity ultimately diverges in the strict 1d limit @xmath18 , it implies the minigap to be equal to the quasiparticle gap @xmath0 .",
    "the end - state mfs protected by such a large minigap can be probed in local tunneling experiments without having to worry about other low energy states with energies comparable to experimental temperatures .",
    "the zero energy modes should manifest themselves in zero - bias conductance peaks which exist only above a critical value of the zeeman splitting required for the topological state .",
    "these conjectures , numerically confirmed for strict 1d wires @xcite , have appeared with calculational details in ref .",
    "in this paper we revisit the question of the minigap in 1d wires and show that the linear scaling of minigap with @xmath0 is valid only for strict 1d wires ( or wires where the transverse confinement induced band gap far exceeds all other energy scales but excluding the fermi energy for multiband occupancy ) . for quasi-1d or multi - band wires @xcite where the confinement band gap is comparable to the applied zeeman energy scale @xcite",
    "the above linear scaling can spectacularly break down .",
    "the parameter regime where the relevant confinement band gap is comparable to the zeeman energy is the so - called ` sweet - spot ' regime @xcite , designed to maximize the robustness of the topological state to inevitable spatial chemical potential fluctuations arising , for example , from unintentional random background charged impurities in the semiconductor .",
    "we show that in this regime , because of an approximate chirality symmetry @xcite of the topological state , multiple near zero energy modes appear at the same end and the nanowire minigap effectively vanishes .",
    "the chirality symmetry in this case refers ( see sec .",
    "iii ) to the existence of a unitary operator that anti - commutes with the hamiltonian .",
    "this symmetry , strictly valid for quasi-1d wires only in the absence of an interband rashba coupling , ensures multiple zero energy mf modes on a given end of the majorana wire . for a finite interband rashba coupling the chirality symmetry",
    "is no longer exact , but we find that the quantitative effects of experimentally realistic interband rashba couplings are insignificant and call the resultant hamiltonian approximately chiral symmetric .    because of the possibility of multiple zero and near zero modes from the same end ( with their total number given by the integer @xmath19 in fig .",
    "[ 1 ] ) , we use here a slightly generalized definition of the minigap as explained below . if @xmath19 is allowed to take only values @xmath20",
    "( i.e. , if the quantum wire had no hidden approximate chirality symmetry ) , the minigap would be strictly defined as the minimum excitation gap above the zero energy mf state .",
    "this definition of the minigap , however , is inadequate when @xmath19 is allowed to take _ any _ integer values in the relevant parameter space .",
    "the integer @xmath19 includes , with the hidden chiral symmetry of the nanowire weakly broken by the interband rashba term , ( @xmath19 mod @xmath21 ) exact zero energy mf states and the remaining ( @xmath19-(@xmath19 mod @xmath21 ) ) _ near zero _ energy states with very small energy splittings @xmath22 , see fig .",
    "this is because only in the presence of exact chirality symmetry an arbitrary number of mf modes can be supported by a given end of a majorana wire .",
    "a finite interband rashba coupling breaks the chirality symmetry , splits the energies of the zero modes in pairs , but does so only weakly .",
    "so in the presence of an experimentally realistic interband rashba , we will show below that there are no exact zero modes for states with even @xmath19 , but there are @xmath19 near zero modes .",
    "similarly , in states with odd @xmath19 , @xmath23 zero modes turn into near zero modes by the interband rashba term , while exactly one mode remains a zero energy mf mode .",
    "the remaining single mf on a given end can not further be split because it is protected by the particle - hole symmetry of the bdg hamiltonian which can not be broken in a superconductor .",
    "@xcite    the slightly generalized definition of the minigap can be understood by noting that , when , say , the @xmath24 state ( fig .  [ 1 ] ) is being probed by a zero bias tunneling peak , for an unambiguous determination of the mf one must also ensure that the tunneling in reality is not probing the near zero energy end - modes in the adjoining @xmath25 state .",
    "this implies that the definition of the minigap be expanded to include also the energy of the near zero modes in the parameter regime _ nearby _ to the mf .",
    "this minigap should also be raised sufficiently above the experimental temperatures to exclude unintentional contributions from near zero energy states in the relevant parameter space .",
    "as we will show , the minigap , thus defined , effectively vanishes for the semiconductor nanowire because of the hidden approximate chiral symmetry . as in the case of 2d ts systems",
    ", it then becomes technically very difficult ( although may not be impossible @xcite ) to probe the physics of isolated mfs and non - abelian statistics at experimentally accessible temperatures @xcite .",
    "fortunately , in 1d , we find that there is a solution to the small minigap problem which involves forcefully breaking the nanowire chirality symmetry by applying a second zeeman field transverse to the wire .",
    "the second zeeman field , orthogonal to the one realizing the topological state , enhances the energies of the near zero energy modes in pairs but leaves the mf state intact , before removing all @xmath19 states above a critical value at which the system transitions into a topologically trivial state with @xmath26 ( fig .  [ 5 ] ) .",
    "thus , if a zero bias conductance peak from an end of the nanowire @xcite splits with increasing the second zeeman field , the splitting is given by the minigap created by the second zeeman field .",
    "for the states with various @xmath19 ( see fig .  [ 1 ] ) , a zero bias conductance peak from the @xmath24 state ( with no near - zero energy mode ) should show no splitting with the transverse field .",
    "the zero bias peak from the @xmath25 state splits with an applied transverse zeeman field because of the externally induced broken chirality symmetry .",
    "the zero bias peak in the @xmath27 state is expected to decrease in height with the applied field but ( @xmath19-(@xmath19 mod @xmath21)=@xmath21 ) new low energy peaks are split off following the energies of the near - zero modes with the increasing second zeeman field .",
    "finally , all low bias peaks should disappear for sufficiently strong second zeeman field as the system transitions into a topologically trivial state with @xmath26 ( fig .",
    "[ 5 ] ) .     and the chemical potential @xmath28 .",
    "different superconducting phases are characterized by the number @xmath19 of low - energy modes with @xmath29 at each end of the wire .",
    "the energies of these modes identically vanish , with @xmath19 denoting the number of exact zero energy mfs at each end , for @xmath30 ( see eq .",
    "( [ hnm ] ) ) . for @xmath31 , ( @xmath19-(@xmath19 mod @xmath21 ) ) modes are near zero modes with very small energy splittings @xmath32 where @xmath0 is the induced quasiparticle gap @xmath33 k. the near - zero energy modes are very robust to all reasonable perturbations including disorder except to a strong zeeman field perpendicular to the length of the nanowire . with the representative parameters of this paper ( @xmath34 mev and an effective @xmath35 for inas @xcite ) ,",
    "the @xmath24 region starts at @xmath36 t. due to the existence of multiple robust near zero modes at each end of the quasi-1d wire the entire region beyond @xmath36 t is effectively gapless .",
    ", scaledwidth=36.0% ]    [ fig2 ]",
    "in a recent paper @xcite niu _ et al . _ have shown that a 1d spinless @xmath2-wave topological superconductor can in principle support _ any _ integer ( not just @xmath37 or @xmath38 ) number of mfs at _",
    "each end_. this has prompted two of us @xcite to examine more closely the analogous case of a 1d rashba - coupled semiconductor nanowire with zeeman splitting proximity - coupled to a s - wave superconductor .",
    "we have shown that this system - the so - called semiconductor  majorana nanowire \" - can also support any integer number of mfs at a given end under invariance of the chirality symmetry . even though the parent 2d system @xcite and others symmetry - related to it @xcite",
    "are in topological class d , we have clarified that the topological class of the 1d semiconductor under chirality symmetry is bdi .",
    "the class bdi is characterized by an integer @xmath39 bulk topological invariant @xcite and thus allows multiple mfs ( with number equal to the integer invariant ) even from a single end .",
    "that the topological class of the 1d system should be bdi follows from the dimensional reduction arguments mentioned in the introduction @xcite .",
    "if we think of the 1d end mf of a nanowire as the dimensionally reduced version of a 2d gapless edge mf mode , then since in 2d there are in principle @xmath39 edge mf modes allowed ( class d in 2d is characterized by a @xmath39 invariant ) it follows that there must be @xmath39 end mfs allowed also in 1d .",
    "hence the nanowire 1d system should also be with a @xmath39 , not @xmath40 , invariant , which leads to bdi being the appropriate topological class .",
    "( a similar dimensional reduction argument should predict that the topological class of the fu - kane system @xcite should reduce from diii in 2d to d in 1d both having a @xmath40 invariant . ) to properly define the bdi class and the associated @xmath39 invariant for the nanowire , we had to invoke @xcite a hidden chirality symmetry of the 1d system and show that , under invariance of this symmetry , the 1d nanowire can support an arbitrary integer number @xmath19 ( @xmath41 ) of zero energy mfs at each end .",

    "this term , however , breaks the exact chirality symmetry of @xmath68 to only an approximate one for @xmath69 .",
    "thus , a finite @xmath66 turns the energies of some of the exact zero modes of @xmath70 into only approximate zero modes for @xmath69 . despite this , as we show in detail below , the energy splittings of these ( @xmath19-(@xmath19 mod @xmath21 ) ) near zero modes due to @xmath71 are very small @xmath32 . on the scale of @xmath0 , therefore , the low - energy spectrum of @xmath31 has the zero and near zero modes all show up as zero energy modes ( see fig .  [ 3 ] ) , whose number ( from each end ) is given by the @xmath39 topological invariant calculated for @xmath70 in the appropriate parameter regime .",
    "thus , in this paper , we will calculate the integer topological invariant ( the number @xmath72 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : w ] ) ) for @xmath70 and compare it with the number of near zero modes from a given end calculated by diagonalizing the full hamiltonian @xmath31 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath31 has been recently studied extensively in connection with realizing mfs in quasi-1d nanowires @xcite .",
    "since the hamiltonian explicitly takes into account multiple confinement band occupancy , it not only lifts the stringent condition of strict one - dimensionally of the nanowire but also allows higher carrier density in the topological states .",
    "even more importantly , for values of the zeeman coupling about half the confinement induced band gap at @xmath73 , the system becomes topological over a wide range of the chemical potential @xmath28 , see fig .",
    "the quasi-1d nanowire , thus , allows the widest possible variation of @xmath28 without crossing a topological phase transition , leading to the maximum robustness of the end - state mfs to spatial disorder .",
    "this can be most easily understood as follows : each confinement induced band index @xmath45 corresponds to a pair of spin - orbit bands which are degenerate at @xmath73 in the absence of @xmath74 .",

    "when the chemical potential falls in the gap created between @xmath44 and @xmath43 at @xmath73 , the system is topological and hosts a single zero energy mf at each end of the wire .",
    "however , with increasing values of @xmath76 the energies of the bands @xmath77 and @xmath78 come close , and it can be shown that @xcite in this regime ( the so - called ` sweet spot ' regime ) the system is topological over a much wider regime of @xmath28 than is allowed for smaller values of @xmath74 .",

    "note that such a zeeman field is still parallel to the plane of the nearby bulk superconductor and thus does not create additional problems with the s - wave superconducting pairing . in the presence of this term",
    ", the bdg hamiltonian of the nanowire becomes , @xmath120    it can be easily checked that both terms with coupling constants @xmath117 and @xmath66 retain diagonal elements even in the basis in which @xmath121 is diagonal .",
    "this implies that @xmath122 is no longer chiral symmetric with @xmath110 as the chirality operator .",
    "based on the available discrete symmetries ( time reversal , particle - hole , complex conjugation , etc . )",
    "it is not possible to find any unitary symmetry operator that anticommutes with @xmath122 .",
    "it follows that the chiral symmetry hidden in @xmath70 has now been broken _ externally _ by @xmath117 . in the absence of @xmath117",
    "if the number of ( near ) zero modes is even , the transverse field creates a gap for all of them resulting in no mf edge mode . in cases where the number of zero modes is odd for @xmath123 ,",
    "the transverse field opens a gap for all of them save one , and the system is reduced to having only one non - degenerate mf edge mode ( at each end ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the minigap above the end - state mfs is now externally tunable by tuning @xmath117 .",
    "it should be kept in mind , however , that @xmath117 can not be increased to arbitrarily large values to attain a large minigap @xmath111 .",
    "this is because , above a critical value @xmath124 , the quasiparticle gap @xmath0 itself closes and the system makes a transition into a topologically trivial state with no mfs ( see fig .",
    "[ 5 ] ) . keeping these constraints in mind ,",

    "the zero bias conductance peak from wire ends @xcite , our analysis predicts that in the sweet spot regimes for @xmath123 the zero bias peak in the @xmath24 state of fig .  [ 1 ] is expected to continue also in the @xmath25 state because of the existence of two near zero modes from the same end . in the presence of increasing @xmath117 ,",
    "the peak in the @xmath24 state will disappear above @xmath127 .",
    "the zero bias peak in the @xmath25 state , however , is expected to first split into two with increasing @xmath117 ( because of the splitting ( fig .  [ 5 ] ) induced by the broken chirality symmetry ) , before disappearing altogether for @xmath127 in the topologically trivial state .",
    "thus , just for the observation of the zero bias peak from the wire ends , a non - zero @xmath117 is not required .",
    "however , to unambiguously probe the physics of isolated mfs and non - abelian statistics in the sweet spot regimes , an optimum transverse zeeman field is required to raise the minigap sufficiently above the experimentally accessible temperatures .",
    "the minigap above the end - state majorana fermions in 1d topological superconducting nanowires scales linearly with the bulk quasiparticle gap @xmath0 .",
    "this fact , now confirmed in many numerical calculations @xcite , solves the problem of small minigap ( @xmath128k ) of 2d ts systems where mfs appear in bulk order parameter defects such as vortices .",
    "here we show that the linear scaling of minigap with @xmath0 is valid only for strict 1d wires or where the confinement induced band gap far exceeds all other energy scales excluding the fermi energy .",
    "we show that the linear scaling fails in parameter regimes ( called ` sweet spot ' regime ) where the confinement band gap is in the range of the zeeman energy scale for which the mfs have been proposed @xcite to be most stable against spatial disorder and chemical potential fluctuations .",
    "the failure of the linear scaling arises from an approximate chiral symmetry of quasi-1d nanowires leading to the possibility of multiple near zero energy modes from each end .",
    "the near zero modes are robust to all reasonable perturbations including disorder , except to an additional transverse zeeman field that can be used to break the approximate chiral symmetry externally .",
    "we show that the nearly vanishing minigap of quasi-1d nanowires in this regime can be restored to experimentally accessible temperatures by applying the second zeeman field perpendicular to the length of the nanowire . for experimental signatures such as",
    "the zero bias conductance peak from the wire ends @xcite , the additional zeeman field removes the zero bias anomaly in the topologically trivial phase for @xmath127 .",
    "an optimum @xmath117 is needed , however , to probe the topological physics of isolated mfs in sweet spot regimes because it can raise the minigap above the experimentally realistic temperatures .",
    "the present paper provides the theoretical description of the minigap for the experimentally relevant quasi-1d semiconductor quantum wires with strong spin - orbit coupling in proximity to a superconductor and external zeeman fields .",
    "previously reported calculations for the minigap @xcite based on idealized quasi-1d spinless p - wave superconducting wires do not apply to the experimental semiconductor nanowire systems where the interplay of spin - orbit coupling and zeeman splitting leads to a helical topological superconductor in the presence of the proximity effect .",
    "even though the two systems have some superficial similarities , notably the topological class which is bdi under chirality symmetry @xcite , the calculation of the minigap is one example where the difference is explicit as explained below . for a quasi-1d spinless p - wave superconductor ref .",
    "[ ] finds a large number of end - localized subgap states with very low energies clustering around the zero energy end state when the chemical potential crosses many confinement induced subbands .",
    "the interpretation of this effect @xcite is in terms of each subband contributing its own mf state , which are then weakly split by the transverse couplings leaving only one exact zero energy eigenvalue when the number of relevant subbands is odd .",
    "we want to emphasize that this effect , which drastically reduces the minigap in spinless p - wave wires with many occupied subbands , is completely absent in the spin - orbit coupled semiconductor wires at low applied fields . for the latter system",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ 3 ] ( upper panel , @xmath129 ) that despite many subband crossings the energy of the first excited state above the mf end state for @xmath24 is close to the bulk quasiparticle gap @xmath0 . thus , in this case , there is no effect akin to the crowding near zero energy effect discussed in the context of spinless p - wave superconductors .",
    "therefore , the fermionic near - zero energy states of ref .",
    "[ ] are not a problem for the topological phase in real semiconductor nanowires although they are generically present in the kitaev - type idealized model of spinless 1d p - wave superconductor .",
    "thus , the experimental semiconductor nanowires are in fact better systems for realizing majorana modes than the idealized spinless p - wave 1d system often studied in theoretical analysis .",
    "this crucial difference between the spinless p - wave case and the case of a semiconductor quantum wire with spin - orbit coupling can be understood with the help of the schematic energy level diagrams in fig .  [ 2 ] .",
    "note that the effective p - wave superconducting order parameter in the basis of the semiconductor bands comes with a sign difference between the two bands in a given spin - orbit pair \\{@xmath130}. this effect underlies the fact that with increasing @xmath28 , but staying at a fixed @xmath74 , no extra near zero modes are generated in the wire ends despite more and more subbands being populated with increasing chemical potential .",
    "this is no longer true if the zeeman coupling is large enough to switch the order of the subbands ( see fig .",
    "[ 2 ] ) and only bands with one sign of the effective superconducting order parameter are populated with increasing @xmath28 . in this case ,",
    "additional mfs will appear with increasing number of the occupied subbands , which will then be weakly split by the chirality breaking fields we discuss in the paper . while this is the case with the spin - orbit coupled quantum wires",
    ", the quasi-1d spinless p - wave superconductor has the same sign of the order parameter in all its confinement bands .",
    "this places the ideal 1d p - wave system considered in ref .",
    "[ ] in the @xmath131 limit of the spin - orbit coupled quantum wires and only in this unphysical limit the minigap is reduced in the experimental quantum wires by the multiband effects discussed in the context of spinless p - wave superconductors .",
