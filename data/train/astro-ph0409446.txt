    "when the iron core of a massive star collapses to a neutron star , a hot proto - neutron star is formed which radiates away its final binding energy as neutrinos .",
    "interaction of these neutrinos with the infalling matter has long been thought to be the mechanism responsible for exploding that part of the progenitor external to the neutron star and making a supernova ( e.g. , janka 2001 ; woosley , heger , & weaver 2002 , and references therein ) . during the few tenths of a second",
    "when the explosion is developing , a convective bubble of photo - disintegrated matter ( nucleons ) , radiation , and pairs lies above the neutron star but beneath an accretion shock .",
    "neutrino interactions in this bubble power its expansion , drive convective overturn , and determine its composition . since baryons exist in the bubble only as nucleons , the critical quantity for nucleosynthesis is the proton mass fraction ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "initially , in part because of an excess of electron neutrinos over antineutrinos , @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "as time passes , however , the fluxes of the different neutrino flavors and their spectra change so that @xmath8 evolves and becomes considerably less than 0.5 .",
    "this epoch , also known as the `` neutrino - powered wind '' , has been explored extensively as a possible site for the r - process @xcite as well as @xmath10zn and some light p - process nuclei @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider nucleosynthesis during the earlier epoch when @xmath8 is still greater than 0.5 .",
    "this results in a novel situation in which the alpha - rich freeze out occurs in the presence of a non - trivial abundance of free protons .",
    "the resulting nuclear flows thus have characteristics of both the alpha - rich freeze out @xcite and the rp - process @xcite .",
    "several proton - rich nuclei , e.g. , @xmath10ge and @xmath11cr , are produced in such great abundance that , after ejection and decay , they contribute a significant fraction of the solar inventory of such species .",
    "the nucleosynthesis calculations in this paper are based on a simulation of the neutrino - driven explosion of a nonrotating 15@xmath1 star ( model s15a of woosley & weaver 1995 ) by @xcite ( see also janka et al .",
    "the post - bounce evolution of the model was followed in two dimensions ( 2d ) with a polar coordinate grid of 400 ( nonequidistant ) radial zones and 32 lateral zones ( 2.7 degrees resolution ) , assuming azimuthal symmetry and using periodic conditions at the boundaries of the lateral wedge at @xmath14 above and below the equatorial plane .",
    "convection was seeded in this simulation by velocity perturbations of order @xmath15 , imposed randomly on the spherical post - bounce core .",
    "the neutrino transport was decribed by solving the energy - dependent neutrino number , energy , and momentum equations in radial direction in all angular bins of the grid , using closure relations from a model boltzmann equation @xcite .",
    "neutrino pressure gradients and neutrino advection in lateral direction were taken into account ( for details , see buras et al .",
    "general relativistic effects were approximately included as described by @xcite .",
    "although convective activity develops in the neutrino - heating layer behind the supernova ( sn ) shock on a time scale of several ten milliseconds after bounce , no explosions were obtained with the described setup until @xmath16250@xmath12ms @xcite , at which time the very cpu - intense simulations usually had to be terminated .",
    "the explosion in the simulation discussed here was a consequence of omitting the velocity - dependent terms from the neutrino momentum equation .",
    "this manipulation increased the neutrino - energy density und thus the neutrino energy deposition in the heating region by @xmath162030% and was sufficient to convert a failed model into an exploding one ( see also janka et al .",
    "2004 , buras et al .",
    "this sensitivity of the outcome of the simulation to only modest changes of the transport treatment demonstrates how close the convecting , 2d models of @xcite with energy - dependent neutrino transport are to ultimate success .",
    "the evolution from the onset of core collapse ( at about @xmath17ms ) through core bounce and convective phase to explosion is shown in terms of mass shell trajectories in fig .",
    "[ massshells ] .",
    "the explosion sets in when the infalling interface between si layer and oxygen - enriched si layer reaches the shock at about 160@xmath12ms post bounce .",
    "the corresponding steep drop of the density and mass accretion rate , associated with an entropy increase by a factor of @xmath182 , allow the shock to expand and convection to become more violent , thus establishing runaway conditions .",
    "the calculation was performed in 2d for following the ejection of the convective shell until 470@xmath12ms after bounce .",
    "while matter is channeled in narrow downflows towards the gain radius , where it is heated by neutrinos and some of it starts expanding again in high - entropy bubbles , its neutron - to - proton ratio is set by weak interactions with electron neutrinos and antineutrinos as well as electron and positron captures on free nucleons .",
    "the final value of @xmath8 is a crucial parameter for the subsequent nucleosynthesis .",
    "the mass distribution of neutrino - heated and -processed ejecta from the convective bubble is plotted in fig .",

    "the neutron star having ceased , this phase is characterized by an essentially spherically symmetric outflow of matter from the nascent neutron star , which is driven by neutrino - energy deposition outside the neutrinosphere @xcite .",
    "this neutrino - powered wind is visible in fig .",
    "[ massshells ] after @xmath16500@xmath12ms .",
    "the fast wind collides with the dense shell of slower ejecta behind the shock and is decelerated again .",
    "the corresponding negative velocity gradient steepens to a reverse shock when the wind expansion becomes supersonic ( fig .",
    "[ massshells ] ; janka & mller 1995 ) .",
    "characteristic parameters for some mass shells in this early wind phase are shown in fig .",
    "six representative shells are sufficient , because the differences between the shells evolve slowly with time according to the slow variation of the conditions ( neutron star radius , gravitational potential , neutrino luminosities and spectra ) in the driving region of the wind near the neutron star surface . in table",
    "[ tbl1w ] the masses associated with the different shells are listed .    at the end of the simulated evolution",
    "the model has accumulated an explosion energy of approximately @xmath19erg .",
    "the mass cut and thus initial baryonic mass of the neutron star is 1.41@xmath12m@xmath13 .",
    "the model fulfills fundamental constraints for type ii sn nucleosynthesis @xcite because the ejected mass having @xmath20 is @xmath2110@xmath22m@xmath13 ( see fig .",
    "[ massye ] ) and thus the overproduction of n=50 ( closed neutron shell ) nuclei of previous explosion models does not occur .",
    "more than 83% of the ejected mass in the convective bubble and early wind phase ( in total 0.03@xmath12m@xmath13 in this rather low - energetic explosion ) have @xmath23 .",
    "the ejection of mostly p - rich matter is in agreement with 1d general relativistic sn simulations with boltzmann neutrino transport in which the explosion was launched by artificially enhancing the neutrino energy deposition in the gain layer @xcite .",
    "the reason for the proton excess is the capture of electron neutrinos and positrons on neutrons , which is favored relative to the inverse reactions because of the mass difference between neutrons and protons and because electron degeneracy becomes negligible in the neutrino - heated ejecta @xcite .",
    "although the explosion in the considered sn model of @xcite was obtained by a regression from the most accurate treatment of the neutrino transport , it not only demonstrates the proximity of such accurate models to explosions , but also provides a consistent description of the onset of the sn explosion due to the convectively supported neutrino - heating mechanism , and of the early sn evolution .",
    "the properties of the resulting explosion are very interesting , including the conditions for nucleosynthesis .",
    "the @xmath8 values of the ejecta should be rather insensitive to the manipulation which enabled the explosion .",
    "on the one hand the expansion velocities of the high - entropy ejecta are still fairly low ( less than a few @xmath24cm@xmath12s@xmath26 ) when weak interactions freeze out , and on the other hand the omitted velocity - dependent effects affect neutrinos and antineutrinos in the same way .      in order to calculate the nucleosynthesis it is necessary to have a starting composition and the temperature - density ( @xmath27 ) history of the matter as it expands and is ejected from the supernova . because the matter is initially in nuclear statistical equilibrium",
    ", the initial values of @xmath8 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 determine the composition which is just protons with a mass fraction @xmath8 and neutrons .",
    "we are most interested in the innermost few hundredths to one tenth of a solar mass to be ejected .",
    "this matter has an interesting history .",
    "it was initially part of the silicon shell of the star , but fell in when the core collapsed , passed through the sn shock and was photodisintegrated to nucleons .",
    "neutrino heating then raised the entropy and energy of the matter causing it to convect .",
    "eventually some portion of this matter gained enough energy to expand and escape from the neutron star , pushing ahead of it the rest of the star .",
    "as it cooled , the nucleons reassembled first into helium and then into heavy elements .",
    "the temperature - density history of such matter is thus not given by the simple ansatz often employed in explosive nucleosynthesis  `` adiabatic expansion on a hydrodynamic time scale '' .",
    "in fact , owing to convection , the temperature history may not even be monotonic .",
    "here we rely on tracer particles embedded in the so called `` hot convective bubble '' of the 15 @xmath1 sn model calculated by @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] ) .",
    "these tracer particles were not distributed uniformly in mass , but chosen to represent a range of @xmath8 in the ejecta .",
    "the proton - rich outflows of interest here begin at about 190 ms after core bounce ( fig .",
    "[ massshells ] ) .",
    "entropies and electron fractions characteristic of a few different trajectories are given in table [ tbl1 ] .",
    "each trajectory represents a different mass element in the convective bubble .",
    "as is seen , @xmath8 for the different trajectories lies in the range from @xmath30 , and the entropies per nucleon are modest , @xmath31 .",
    "figure  [ massye ] shows the ejected mass versus @xmath8 during the convective phase of the sn explosion .    at the end of the 2d calculation of @xcite , the mass element in a typical trajectory",
    "had reached a radius of about @xmath32 @xmath33(corresponding to the time when the sn model was mapped from 2d to 1d and thus detailed information for the mass elements was lost ) .",
    "temperatures at this radius were typically @xmath345 , which is still hot enough that nuclei have not yet completely re - assembled . to follow the nucleosynthesis until all nuclear reactions had frozen out it was necessary to extrapolate the trajectories to low temperature .",
    "in doing so , we assumed that the electron fraction and entropy were constant during the extrapolated portion of the trajectory .",
    "this should be valid because the number of neutrino captures suffered by nuclei beyond @xmath35 @xmath33is small .",
    "we considered two approximations to the expansion which should bracket the actual behavior .",
    "the first assumes homologous expansion at a velocity given by the janka et al .",
    "calculation between 10 billion and 4 billion k. this ignores any deceleration experienced as the hot bubble encounters the overlying star and is surely an underestimate of the actual cooling time ( though perhaps realistic for the accretion - induced collapse of a bare white dwarf ) . in particular , we estimated the homologous expansion time scale for each trajectory as @xmath36 where the subscript @xmath37 denotes the value of a quantity when @xmath38 and the subscript @xmath39 denotes the value of a quantity at the last time given for the tracer particle history ( @xmath405 ) .",
    "values of @xmath41 for different trajectories are given in table [ tbl1 ] .",
    "the second approximation was an attempt to realistically represent material catching up with the supernova shock .",
    "this extrapolation is based on smoothly merging the trajectories found in the calculations of janka et al . with those calculated for the inner zone of the same 15 @xmath1 supernova by @xcite .",
    "there are some differences .",
    "the earlier study was in one dimension and the shock was launched artificially using a piston .",
    "the kinetic energy at infinity of the woosley - weaver model was @xmath42 erg ; that of the janka et al.model was @xmath43 erg .",
    "still the calculations agreed roughly in the temperature and density at the time when the evaluation of tracer particles in the current 2d simulation was stopped . in order not to have discontinuities in the entropy at the time when the two calculations are matched ,",
    "the density in the previous 1d calculation is changed slightly .",
    "this merging of the late time trajectories is expected to be reasonable because the shock evolution at several seconds post core bounce is determined mostly by the explosion energy .",
    "we shall see in sect .",
    "[ sec : nucresults ] that abundances of key nuclei are particularly sensitive to the time it takes the flow to cool from @xmath44k to @xmath45k .",
    "the homologous expansion approximation gives this time as about 100200 ms , while the kepler based estimate gives this time as about 1 sec .",
    "both estimates are rough and should be viewed as representing upper and lowed bounds to the time scale .",
    "figure  [ figrho ] shows the evolution of density in a representative trajectory for each of the two approximations to the flow at large radii . the temperature history in these trajectories is shown in fig .",
    "[ figtemp ] .",
    "note the irregular and non - monotonic evolution of the thermodynamic quantities at early times .",
    "while the shock sweeps through and expels the stellar mantle , matter is still being continuously ablated from the surface of the cooling neutron star .",
    "neutrino heating , principally via charged current neutrino capture , acts to maintain pressure - driven outflow in the tenuous atmosphere formed by the ablated material .",
    "this outflow has a higher entropy and is less irregular than the convective bubble .",
    "the evolution of material at radii smaller than a few hundred km is set by characteristics of the cooling neutron star .",
    "it is at these small radii that the asymptotic entropy @xmath46 and electron fraction @xmath8 are set . at early times",
    "the neutron star has yet to radiate away the bulk of its gravitational energy and so has a relatively large radius .",
    "material escaping the star during this period only needs to gain a little energy through heating to escape the still shallow gravitational potential .",
    "consequently , the entropy of the asymptotic outflow is about a factor of two smaller than the entropy of winds leaving the neutron star @xmath1610 seconds post core - bounce .",
    "this can be seen from the analytic estimate provided by @xcite @xmath47 here @xmath48 , @xmath49 approximately the mean energy of electron anti - neutrinos and @xmath50 is the neutron star radius .",
    "a lower entropy implies a higher density and therefore faster particle capture rates at a given temperature . for proton - rich outflows",
    "this typically results in synthesis of heavier elements .",
    "the electron fraction in the outflow is set by a competition between different lepton capture processes on free nucleons : @xmath51 because the neutron star is still deleptonizing at early times , the @xmath52 and @xmath53 spectra can be quite similar . also , once heating raises the entropy of material leaving the neutron star , the number densities and spectra of electrons and positrons within the material become similar . under these circumstances the 1.29 mev threshold for @xmath54 results in @xmath55 capture rates which are slower than the inverse @xmath56 capture rates .",
    "weak processes then drive the outflow proton rich .",
    "the electron fraction in the wind is mostly set by the competition between @xmath52 and @xmath53 capture ( because @xmath57 captures freeze out when the density and temperature in the outflow become low , whereas high - energy neutrinos streaming out from the neutrinosphere still continue to react with nucleons ) .",
    "when the composition comes to equilibrium with the neutrino fluxes , @xmath58 here @xmath59 represents the electron neutrino or antineutrino capture rate on neutrons or protons .",
    "because the star is still deleptonizing at early times , the @xmath52 and @xmath53 spectra can be quite similar .",
    "the 1.29@xmath12mev threshold for @xmath53 capture then leads to @xmath60 , and proton - richness is established in the outflow .",
    "finally also the neutrino reactions cease because of the @xmath61 dilution of the neutrino density with growing distance @xmath62 from the neutron star .",
    "table [ tbl1w ] gives characteristics of the early wind found in the simulations of @xcite .",
    "as expected , the wind is proton rich at early times .",
    "eventually , the hardening of the @xmath53 spectrum relative to the @xmath52 spectrum will cause @xmath8 to fall below 1/2 .",
    "this turnover has not yet occurred when the hydrodynamic simulation was stopped .",
    "it should take place at a later time when the wind properties ( mass loss rate , entropy ) have changed such that the nucleosynthesis constraints for the amount of @xmath63 ejecta @xcite will not be violated . at 1.3@xmath12s after bounce the mass loss rate of about @xmath64m@xmath65s@xmath26 and wind entropy of @xmath1880@xmath66 per nucleon in the janka et al .",

    "this is because the @xmath102 daughter of @xmath11cr is @xmath11v , which has a relatively small proton separation energy of 1.6 mev . at low temperatures the saha equation favors proton capture to @xmath83cr .",
    "if the expansion is slow enough that most @xmath11cr decays at temperatures where @xmath124 is still rapid , then flow out of the n=22 nuclei occurs via @xmath102 decay out of @xmath83cr . in this case",
    "@xmath83ti is synthesized rather than @xmath11sc .",
    "@xmath7 originates from the the n=24 nuclide @xmath125 . at @xmath126 nuclei with n=24",
    "are divided roughly equally between @xmath125 and @xmath127 .",
    "uncertainties in the proton separation energies and lifetimes of these nuclei are small .",
    "@xmath125 does have a low lying excited state at 382@xmath12kev which is thermally populated at low temperatures .",
    "however , @xmath128 is a nucleus with z = n+1 that is expected to have ground and excited state decay rates that are dominated by super - allowed fermi transitions which are almost independent of excitation energy .",
    "lastly , we turn our attention to flow out of the n=32 isotones which are progenitors of @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "proton - rich nucleosynthesis near @xmath3 has been extensively discussed in the x - ray burst literature ( e.g. brown et al .",
    "uncertainties in basic nuclear properties important for synthesis of @xmath129 are small .",
    "this is not true for @xmath130 , which is formed directly by the decay of @xmath131 .",
    "@xmath131 has a @xmath132excited state at 75.4 kev which dominates the partition function at @xmath121 since the ground state has @xmath133 .",
    "the weak lifetime of this excited state is experimentally undetermined ( as are the weak lifetimes of all short lived excited states ) and could easily be a factor of five longer or shorter than the quite long ground state lifetime of @xmath134 sec .",
    "this translates into an uncertainty of a factor of several in the inferred @xmath130 yield .",
    "the influence of possible uncertainties in the time scale , entropy , and electron fraction characterizing the different trajectories can be seen from the results in table [ tbl1 ] .",
    "modest changes in the outflow parameters result in factors of @xmath135 changes in yields of the most important isotopes .",
    "this is evident by the quite different efficiencies with which the lower entropy bubble and higher entropy wind synthesize @xmath11sc and @xmath80ti .",
    "so far we have not considered the influence of neutrino interactions , except implicitly through the setting of @xmath8 .",
    "if matter remains close to the neutron star , neutrino capture and neutrino - induced spallation may compete with positron decay , even on a dynamic time scale .",
    "however , neutrino capture alone can not act to accelerate nuclear flow past waiting point nuclei and allow synthesis of the heavier proton - rich elements .",
    "the reason is that the neutrino capture rates on the waiting point nuclei are about the same as the rate of neutrino capture on a free proton @xcite .",
    "every capture of a neutrino by a heavy nucleus is accompanied by a capture onto a free proton .",
    "the electron fraction is then rapidly driven to @xmath136 since the neutron produced in this way immediately goes into the formation of an @xmath108-particle .",
    "this is analogous to the `` @xmath108-effect '' discussed in the context of late - time winds @xcite .",
    "the important news is that , unlike simulations of a few years ago , there is no poisonous overproduction of neutron - rich nuclei in the vicinity of the n = 50 closed shell @xcite . when followed in more detail ( i.e.  mainly with a better , spectral treatment of the neutrino transport ) , weak interactions in the hot convective bubble drive @xmath8 back to 0.5 and above so that most of the mass comes out as @xmath2ni and @xmath137he .",
    "since @xmath2fe and helium are abundant in nature , this poses no problem .    beyond this",
    "it is also interesting that the proton - rich environment of the hot convective bubble and early neutrino - driven wind can synthesize interesting amounts of some comparatively rare intermediate mass elements .",
    "if the total mass of sn ejecta with @xmath138 is larger than a few hundredths of a solar mass , these proton - rich outflows may be responsible for a significant fraction of the solar abundances of @xmath4 , @xmath6 , and some ti isotopes , especially @xmath80ti .",
    "however , these ejecta do not appear to be implicated in the synthesis of elements that do not have other known astrophysical production sites .",
    "for example , @xmath139 can be produced explosively , while @xmath6 can be synthesized in a slightly neutron - rich wind .",
    "it seems unlikely that consideration of nucleosynthesis in proton - rich outflows will lead to meaningful constraints on conditions during the early sn .",
    "since the conditions in the hot convective bubble resemble in some ways those of type i x - ray bursts ( high temperature and proton mass fraction ) , we initially hoped that the nuclear flows would go higher , perhaps producing the @xmath140-process isotopes of mo and ru .",
    "such species have proven difficult to produce elsewhere and the @xmath141-process in x - ray bursts can go up as high as tellurium @xcite . unfortunately the density is much less here than in the neutron star and the time scale shorter .",
    "proton - induced flows are weaker and the leakage through critical waiting point nuclei is smaller . using the present nuclear physics , significant production above a@xmath12=@xmath1264 is unlikely .",
    "however , heavier nuclei can be produced in ejecta that are right next to these zones but with values of @xmath8 considerably less than 0.50 @xcite .",
