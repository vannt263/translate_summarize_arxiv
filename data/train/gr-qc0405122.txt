    "the dynamical physical mechanism responsible for the relaxation of perturbation fields outside a black hole and the decay rates of the various perturbations have been extensively studied @xcite-@xcite since wheeler introduced the no - hair theorem in the early 1970s @xcite .",
    "the massless neutral external perturbations were first studied by price , and it was found that the late - time behavior for a fixed  @xmath0 is dominated by the factor  @xmath1 for each multiple moment  @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the massless charged scalar field was studied in refs . @xcite-@xcite and the conclusion was that a charged hair decay slower than a neutral one , i.e. , the charged scalar hair outside a charged black hole is dominated by a  @xmath3 tail .",
    "the massless late - time tail for the gravitational , electromagnetic , neutrino and scalar perturbations had also been considered in the case of the kerr black holes in refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite . on the other hand",
    ", many authors found that the analysis of massive fields is also physically important since massive fields can cause interesting phenomena which are qualitatively different from the massless case .",
    "the evolution of a massive scalar field in the schwarzschild background was analyzed by starobinskii and novikov @xcite , and they found that , because of the mass term , there are poles in the complex plane closer to the real axis than in the massless case , which leads to inverse power - law behavior with smaller indices than the massless case .",
    "hod and piran @xcite pointed out that , if the field mass @xmath4 is small , namely  @xmath5 , the oscillatory inverse power - law behavior @xmath6 dominates as the intermediate late - time tails in the reissner - nordstrm background .",
    "we @xcite recently investigated the late - time tails of the massless and the self - interacting ( massive ) scalar fields in a stationary axisymmetric einstein - maxwell - dilaton - axion black - hole geometry , and found that the dumping exponents is independent of the rotation parameter and the dilaton of the black hole .    although much attention has been paid to the study of the late - time behaviors of the scalar , gravitational , electromagnetic in static and stationary black - hole backgrounds , however , to my best knowledge , at the moment the late - time evolution of the dirac fields has not been investigated .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the intermediate late - time tail behavior of the massive dirac fields in the schwarzschild black - hole background and to see whether or not special properties exist in this case .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec.2",
    "the decoupled massive dirac equations in the schwarzschild spacetime are presented . in sec.3 the black - hole green s function",
    "is introduced by using the spectral decomposition method @xcite . in sec.4 the intermediate late - time evolution of the dirac massive fields in the schwarzschild background is investigated .",
    "the section v is devoted to a summary and conclusion . in the appendix we study whether the conclusions might change if the tortoise coordinate is defined in the conventional way .",

    "we will use the potential ( [ v1 ] ) to study the late - time tail behavior of the massive dirac fields in the schwarzschild black - hole geometry .",
    "it is easy to see that near the event horizon the effective potential @xmath36 becomes zero .",
    "then the radial asymptotic solutions can be expressed as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the usual tortoise coordinate . by comparing eq .",
    "( [ solu1 ] ) with the scalar field solutions @xmath39 @xcite we know that the dirac field possesses a additional factor @xmath40 .",

    "it is well known that massive tails exist even in a flat spacetime @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is related to the fact that different frequencies forming a massive wave packet have different phase velocities .",
    "one will see that at intermediate times the backscattering from asymptotically far regions ( which dominates the tails of massless fields ) is negligible compared to the flat spacetime massive tails that appear here .",
    "hod , piran , and leaver @xcite argued that the asymptotic massive tail is associated with the existence of a branch cut ( in @xmath58 ) placed along the interval @xmath59 .",
    "this tail arises from the integral of the green function @xmath60 around the branch ( denoted by @xmath61 ) .",
    "so our goal is to evaluate @xmath62 .",
    "now we assume that both the observer and the initial data are situated far away from the black hole so that @xmath63 .",
    "one may expand the wave - equation ( [ 16 ] ) with the potential @xmath64 which is given by ( [ v1 ] ) ( or @xmath34 ) for the massive dirac field as a power series in @xmath65 ( neglecting terms of order @xmath66 ) as follows @xmath67 with @xmath68 for the massive scalar field is now replaced by @xmath69 for the massive dirac field . as we will see later , it is the difference that leads to new result .",
