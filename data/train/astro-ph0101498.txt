    "the egret experiment on the compton gamma ray observatory has detected pulsed signals from seven rotation - powered pulsars ( e.g. , for crab , nolan et al .",

    "the modulation of the @xmath0-ray light curves at gev energies testifies to the production of @xmath0-ray radiation in the pulsar magnetospheres either at the polar cap ( harding , tademaru , & esposito 1978 ; daugherty & harding 1982 , 1996 ; sturner , dermer , & michel 1995 ; shibata , miyazaki , & takahara 1998 ) , or at the vacuum gaps in the outer magnetosphere ( cheng , ho , & ruderman 1986a , b , hereafter chr ; chiang & romani 1992 , 1994 ; romani and yadigaroglu 1995 ; romani 1996 ; zhang & cheng 1997 , zc97 ) .",
    "effective @xmath0-ray production in a pulsar magnetosphere may be extended to the very high energy ( vhe ) region above 100 gev as well ; however , the predictions of fluxes by the current models of @xmath0-ray pulsars are not sufficiently conclusive ( e.g. , cheng 1994 ) .",
    "whether or not the spectra of @xmath0-ray pulsars continue up to the vhe region is a question that remains one of the interesting issues of high - energy astrophysics .    in the vhe region ,",
    "positive detections of radiation at a high confidence level have been reported from the direction of the crab pulsar ( nel et al .",
    "however , as for _ pulsed _ tev radiation , only the upper limits have been , as a rule , obtained ( akerlof et al .",
    "1993 ; borione et al .",
    "1997 ; srinivasan et al .",
    "1997 ; yoshikoshi et al .",
    "1997 ; sako et al .",
    "if the vhe emission originates in the pulsar magnetosphere , a significant fraction of it can be expected to show pulsation .",
    "therefore , the lack of _ pulsed _ tev emissions provides a severe constraint on the modeling of particle acceleration zones in a pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "in fact , in the chr picture , the magnetosphere should be optically thick for pair  production in order to reduce the tev flux to an unobserved level by absorption .",
    "this in turn requires very high luminosities of infrared photons .",
    "however , the required ir fluxes are generally orders of magnitude larger than the observed values ( usov 1994 ) .",
    "we are therefore motivated by the need to contrive an outer  gap model that produces less tev emission with a moderate infrared luminosity .",
    "high - energy emission from a pulsar magnetosphere , in fact , crucially depends on the acceleration electric field , @xmath1 , along the magnetic field lines .",
    "it was hirotani and shibata ( 1999a , b , c ; hereafter papers  i , ii , iii ) , and hirotani ( 2000a ; hereafter paper  vi ) who first considered the spatial distribution of @xmath1 together with particle and @xmath0-ray distribution functions . by solving these vlasov equations , they demonstrated that a stationary gap is formed around the conventional null surface at which the local goldreich ",
    "julian charge density , @xmath2 vanishes , where @xmath3 is the component of the magnetic field along the rotation axis , @xmath4 the angular frequency of the neutron star , and @xmath5 the speed of light .",
    "equation ( [ eq : def_rhogj ] ) is valid unless the gap is located close to the light cylinder , of which distance from the rotation axis is given by @xmath6 .",
    "the electrodynamic model developed in this paper is basically the same as paper  vi .",
    "however , we find an interesting behavior of the gap position , by relaxing the boundary conditions to allow electric current injection through the inner or the outer boundaries of the gap .",
    "subsequently , hirotani ( 2000b , hereafter paper  iv ; 2001 , paper  v ) considered the gap closure condition so that a gap may maintain a stationary pair - production cascade . in this paper",
    ", this closure condition is generalized into the case when the currents are injected through the boundaries .    in the next two sections ,",
    "we describe the physical processes of pair production cascade and the resultant @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "we then apply the theory to the crab pulsar and present the expected @xmath0-ray spectra in ",
    "[ sec : app_crab ] . in the final section ,",
    "we discuss the possibility of a gap formation for a super goldreich - julian current .",
    "let us first consider the gap position analytically when there is a current injection into the gap .",
    "we consider the particle continuity equations in   [ sec : cont ] and the @xmath0-ray boltzmann equations in ",
    "[ sec : boltz_gamma ] .      under the mono - energetic approximation",
    ", we simply assume that the electrostatic and the curvature - radiation - reaction forces cancel each other in the boltzmann equations of particles .",
    "then the spatial number density of the outwardly and inwardly propagating particles , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , at distance @xmath9 from the neutron - star surface along the last - open field line , obey the following continuity equations : @xmath10 where @xmath11;\\ ] ] @xmath12 and @xmath13 refer to the distribution functions of outwardly and inwardly propagating @xmath0-ray photons , respectively , having energy @xmath14 .",
    "the pair production rate for an outwardly propagating ( or inwardly propagating ) @xmath0-ray photon to materialize as a pair per unit time is expressed by @xmath15 ( or @xmath16 ) . for charge definiteness",
    ", we consider that a positive electric field arises in the gap . in this case , @xmath17 ( or @xmath18 ) represents the number densities of positrons ( or electrons ) .    the particle velocity at position ( @xmath19,@xmath20 ) becomes ( eq .

    "since @xmath1 arises in the gap , the corresponding drift velocity appears as @xmath26 .",
    "unless the gap is located close to the light cylinder , we can neglect the terms containing @xmath27 as a first  order approximation .",

    "the pair production rate per unit time by a single @xmath0-ray photon , @xmath36 , are defined as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the pair - production cross section and @xmath39 refers to the collision angle between the @xmath0-rays and the x - rays ( see paper  vi for more details about eq .  [ [ eq : def_etap_0 ] ] ) ; @xmath40 $ ]",
    ". the adopted value of @xmath41 will be detailed in   [ sec : x ] .",
    "the quantity @xmath42 refers to the x - ray energy in the unit of @xmath43 .    although @xmath44 is adopted after   [ sec : basic ] , in this section we simply neglect the projection effect of the poloidal velocity and put @xmath45",
    ". then equation  ( [ eq : cont - eq ] ) gives @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 refer to the distribution functions of the outwardly and inwardly propagating @xmath0-rays ; the mean free path @xmath49 is defined by @xmath50 since @xmath51 is justified for the crab pulsar ( paper  v ) , we regard @xmath49 to be constant in the gap in this section .      unlike the charged particles , @xmath0-rays do not propagate along the magnetic field line at each point , because they preserve the directional information where they were emitted . however , to avoid complications",
    ", we simply assume that the outwardly ( or inwardly ) propagating @xmath0-rays dilate ( or constrict ) at the same rate with the magnetic field .",
    "this assumption gives a good estimate when @xmath51 holds .",
    "we then obtain ( paper  vi ) @xmath52 where ( e.g. , rybicki , lightman 1979 ) @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 is the curvature radius of the magnetic field lines and @xmath57 is the modified bessel function of @xmath58 order .",
    "the effect of the broad spectrum of curvature @xmath0-rays is represented by the factor @xmath59 in equation ( [ eq : def - etac ] ) .",
    "noting that the absorption due to pair production is negligible compared with curvature emission term on the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : boltz_gam ] ) , and putting @xmath45 again , we obtain @xmath60     = \\frac{\\eta_{\\rm c}({\\epsilon_\\gamma})}{c }       \\frac{n_\\pm(s)}{b}.    \\label{eq : boltz - gam2}\\ ] ] integrating equation  ( [ eq : boltz - gam2 ] ) over @xmath61 , and combining with equation  ( [ eq : cont - eq2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the upper cutoff dimensionless @xmath0-ray energy . in the present paper , we set @xmath64 ( see   [ sec : basic ] ) .",
    "one combination of the two independent equations  ( [ eq : cont - eq3 ] ) yields the conserved current per magnetic flux tube , @xmath65 if @xmath66 , the conserved current density becomes its goldreich - julian value .",
    "another combination of equations  ( [ eq : cont - eq3 ] ) gives @xmath67 where @xmath68 referes to the expectation value of the number of @xmath0-rays emitted by a single particle that runs a typical length @xmath69 in the gap .    in a stationary gap ,",
    "the pair production optical depth , @xmath70 , must equal the expectation value for a @xmath0-ray to materialize with the gap , @xmath71/@xmath72 .",
    "we thus obtain the following condition : @xmath73 which is automatically satisfied by the stationary vlasov equations . here",
    ", the dimensionless current density , @xmath74 , created in the gap is defined by @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 designate the position of the inner and the outer boundaries , respectively .",
    "that is , @xmath78 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : closure ] ) corresponds to a generalized verion of the gap closure condition considered in papers  iv and v ( e.g. eq .  [ 30 ] in paper  v ) , in which @xmath79 and hence @xmath80 was assumed .",
    "when there is a current injection ( i.e. , when @xmath81 or @xmath82 is non - vanishing ) , not only the produced particles in the gap but also the injected particles contribute for the @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "therefore , the gap width is adjusted smaller compared with @xmath79 case by the factor @xmath83 . utilizing condition  ( [ eq : closure ] ) , we can rewrite equation  ( [ eq : master_eq_1 ] ) into the form @xmath84    to solve the differential equation  ( [ eq : master_eq ] ) , we impose the following two bounday conditions : @xmath85 @xmath86 with the aid of equation  ( [ eq : def_jgap ] ) , these two bounday conditions give @xmath87 at @xmath88 , and @xmath89 at @xmath90 .",

    ", we obtain @xmath99 ,    \\label{eq : poisson_1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath100 and @xmath101 there are essentially three assumptions that are used to derive equations  ( [ eq : poisson_1 ] ) , ( [ eq : poisson_1a ] ) , and ( [ eq : poisson_1b ] ) : the radiation - reaction forces exactly cancel with the electrostatic force in the particles boltzmann equations ; @xmath102 , which may be justified for a power - law , magnetospheric x - ray component ; and the poisson equation is analyzed one - dimensionally along the magnetic field line .      to examine the poisson equation  ( [ eq : poisson_1 ] ) analytically , we assume that the transfield thickness of the gap is greater than @xmath96 and replace @xmath103 with @xmath104 .",
    "furthermore , we neglect the current created in the gap and simply set @xmath105 .",
    "first , consider the case when a current injects from neither of the boundaries , that is , @xmath79 .",
    "it follows that the derivative of the acceleration field ( i.e. , @xmath106 ) vanishes at the conventional null surface where @xmath3 vanishes .",
    "we may notice that @xmath106 is positive at the inner part of the gap and changes its sign near the gap center ( @xmath107 ) to become negative at the outer part of the gap .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the gap is located ( or centers ) around the conventional null surface , if there is no current injection from outside .",
    "secondly , consider the case when a current is injected at the inner boundary ( at @xmath108 ) and @xmath109 holds . since the function @xmath110 is positive at arbitrary @xmath9 , the gap center is located at a place where @xmath3 is negative , that is , outside of the conventional null surface . in particular ,",
    "when @xmath111 holds , @xmath106 vanishes at the place where @xmath112 . in a vacuum , static dipole field ,",
    "@xmath112 is realized along the last - open field line at the light cylinder .",
    "therefore , the gap is expected to shift towards the light cylinder , if the injected current density at the inner boundary approaches the goldreich - julian value .",
    "we may notice here that @xmath110 is less than unity , because @xmath113 does not exceed @xmath69 .",
    "thirdly and finally , consider the case when @xmath114 holds . in this case",
    ", @xmath106 vanishes at the place where @xmath115 .",
    "therefore , gap is expected to be located close to the star surface , if a goldreich - julian current density is injected at the outer boundary . in",
    "what follows , we will examine more accurately these predictions on the gap position vs. current injection , by solving the vlasov equations  ( [ eq : cont - eq ] ) , ( [ eq : boltz_gam ] ) , and ( [ eq : poisson_1 ] ) numerically .",
    "in the present paper , we assume that the transfield thickness , @xmath95 , of the gap is much greater than @xmath96 , and neglect the transfield derivatives in the poisson equation  ( [ eq : poisson_0 ] ) .",
    "we consider that this one - dimensional analysis could be justified because @xmath116 is required so that the predicted gev flux may be consistent with the egret observations (   [ sec : res_ell ] ) .",
    "we rewrite the vlasov equations into the suitable forms for numerical analysis in   [ sec : basic ] , and impose boundary conditions in   [ sec : bd ] .",
    "as will be shown at the end of this section , it is convenient to introduce the typical debey scale length @xmath117 , @xmath118 where @xmath119 represents the magnetic field strength at the gap center .",

    "equating the electric force @xmath153 and the radiation reaction force , we obtain the saturated lorentz factor at each point as @xmath154 we compute the curvature radius @xmath155 at each point for a newtonian dipole magnetic field .",
    "since the maximum of @xmath156 and the potential drop are roughly proportional to @xmath157 and @xmath158 , respectively ( paper  v ) , the particles become unsaturated for very small @xmath96 . to avoid an overestimation of the lorentz factor in such cases ,",

    "<S> the charge depletion due to global flows of charged particles , causes a large electric field along the magnetic field lines . </S>",
    "<S> migratory electrons and/or positrons are accelerated by this field to radiate curvature gamma - rays , some of which collide with the x - rays to materialize as pairs in the gap . </S>",
    "<S> the replenished charges partially screen the electric field , which is self - consistently solved together with the distribution functions of particles and gamma - rays . </S>",
    "<S> if no current is injected at either of the boundaries of the accelerator , the gap is located around the conventional null surface , where the local goldreich - julian charge density vanishes . however , we first find that the gap position shifts outwards ( or inwards ) when particles are injected at the inner ( or outer ) boundary . </S>",
    "<S> applying the theory to the crab pulsar , we demonstrate that the pulsed tev flux does not exceed the observational upper limit for moderate infrared photon density and that the gap should be located near to or outside of the conventional null surface so that the observed spectrum of pulsed gev fluxes may be emitted via a curvature process . </S>",
    "<S> some implications of the existence of a solution for a super goldreich - julian current are discussed . </S>"
