    "pricing and hedging of contingent claims is the crucial computation done within every model in mathematical finance . for",
    "european type claims this amounts to the computation of the expected value of a functional of the ( discounted ) price process under some martingale measure .",
    "hedging portfolios are then constructed via appropriate derivatives of those expected values with respect to model parameters or to the prices , so called `` greeks '' .",
    "let us denote the ( discounted ) price process at time @xmath1 , a vector in @xmath2 , by @xmath3 .",
    "we can roughly distinguish three cases of complexity for the mentioned computations :    1 .",
    "the probability distribution of @xmath3 is known analytically .",
    "the characteristic function of @xmath3 is known analytically .",
    "the local characteristics of @xmath3 are known analytically .    in the first case ,",
    "a numerical quadrature algorithm is sufficient for the efficient computation of the contingent claim s price @xmath4 $ ] , where @xmath5 denotes some payoff function . in the second case ,",
    "variants of plancherel s theorem are applied in order to evaluate the price @xmath4 $ ] , for instance , @xmath6 = \\int_{\\mathbb{r}^n } \\widehat{\\phi}(u ) e [ \\exp ( i\\langle u , x_t \\rangle ) ] du,\\ ] ] where @xmath7 denotes the fourier transform of the function @xmath8 .",
    "remark that often modifications of the original payoff function are used to make the fourier methodology applicable .",
    "this is numerically efficient , even though its implementation ( in particular the complex integration ) can take some time ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "also there are different levels of what it means to `` know analytically '' the characteristic function of @xmath3 .",
    "if one , e.g. in affine models , has to solve a high - dimensional riccati equation for each @xmath9 to calculate the characteristic function @xmath10 $ ] , the `` analytic knowledge '' means at least some pre - calculations which have to be performed efficiently , too . in other words ,",
    "methods applying the characteristic function are efficient if the amount of pre - calculations is limited .",
    "the third case is characterized by the use of monte - carlo simulation methods : one samples from the ( unknown ) distribution of @xmath3 by generating , for instance through euler schemes , approximate distributions for @xmath3 . from those approximate distributions , which should be easy to simulate",
    ", one draws a sufficient amount of samples .",
    "this two - step procedure is very robust , but takes a considerable amount of time .    in this article",
    "we would like to add a fourth case , which in the previous order would correspond to case @xmath11 .",
    "we can describe a class of processes , called `` polynomial processes '' , where it is easy and efficient to compute moments of all orders of the random variable @xmath3 , even though neither the probability distribution nor its characteristic function need to be known .",
    "we shall analyze this class and show that exponential lvy processes , affine processes or jacobi - type processes belong to it .",
    "the method is best explained by an example : consider a stochastic volatility model of svjj - type @xcite , i.e.  both the logarithmic ( discounted ) price processes and the stochastic volatility can jump .",
    "such models can be described by stochastic differential equations of the type @xmath12 where @xmath13 are possibly correlated brownian motions , and @xmath14 are lvy processes , independent of @xmath13 , where the second component @xmath15 is a subordinator . for such models",
    "there is no easy - to - implement ( explicit ) formula for the characteristic function , even though they are affine models .",
    "assuming now appropriate moment conditions for the jump measures , the markov process @xmath16 has the remarkable property that the expected value of _ any polynomial _ of the process @xmath16 is _ again a polynomial in @xmath17 and @xmath18_. the coefficients of this polynomial can be calculated efficiently by exponentiating a matrix , which can be easily deduced from the generator . in other words , there is a dense subset of claims in the set of `` all '' claims , where the prices and hedging ratios are known explicitly ( up to matrix exponentials ) .",
    "this explicit knowledge allows to compute prices of general claims by variance reduction techniques , which is more efficient ( and easier to implement ) than fourier methods with `` unknown '' characteristic function .",
    "the article is devoted to a study of polynomial processes in some depths together with their most obvious applications to mathematical finance .",
    "as the most striking application we see the possibility to reduce the variance of monte carlo evaluations within a polynomial model by approximating the claim through elements of the dense subset of already priced claims . the remainder of our article is organized as follows : in section [ sec - pol - proc ] we introduce formally the class of @xmath0-polynomial processes and draw several basic conclusions . in  [ sec - pol - proc - feller ]",
