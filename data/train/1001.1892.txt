    "axions were postulated to solve the strong - cp problem in qcd in the 1970s @xcite , and are still the most compelling explanation for it . moreover",
    ", they are also appealing for astrophysicists , since they are valid dark matter candidates to constitute a portion or the totality of the non - barionic cold dark matter content predicted to exist in the universe .",
    "but probably the most interesting property of axions , or in a more generic way , axion - like particles ( alps ) , where the mass @xmath0 and the coupling constant are not related to each other , is that they are expected to oscillate into photons ( and viceversa ) in the presence of magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "this oscillation of photons to alps are the main vehicle used at present in axion searches , like those carried out by cast @xcite or admx @xcite , but they could also have important implications for astronomical observations .",
    "for example , they could distort the spectra of gamma - ray sources , such as active galactic nuclei ( agns ) @xcite or galactic sources in the tev range @xcite .",
    "these distortions may be detected by current gamma - ray experiments , such as imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) like magic @xcite , hess @xcite , veritas @xcite or cangaroo - iii @xcite , covering energies in the range 0.1 - 20 tev , and by the fermi satellite @xcite , which operates at energies in the range 0.02 - 300 gev .    given a domain of length @xmath1 , where there is a roughly constant magnetic field and plasma frequency , the probability of a photon of energy @xmath2 to be converted into an alp after traveling through it can be written as @xcite :    @xmath3    here @xmath4 is the oscillation wave number : @xmath5    @xmath6 that gives us an idea of how effective is the mixing , i.e. @xmath7 where @xmath8 the magnetic field component along the polarization vector of the photon and @xmath9 the inverse of the coupling constant .",
    "@xmath10 is the vacuum cotton - mouton term , i.e. @xmath11 where @xmath12  g the critical magnetic field strength ( @xmath13 is the electron charge ) .",
    "@xmath14 is the plasma term : @xmath15 where @xmath16 the plasma frequency , @xmath17 the electron mass and @xmath18 the electron density .",
    "finally , @xmath19 is the alp mass term : @xmath20    note that in eqs.([eq : deltab]-[eq : deltaa ] ) we have introduced the dimensionless quantities @xmath21 g , @xmath22 gev and @xmath23 ev .",
    "since we expect to have not only one coherence domain but several domains with magnetic fields different from zero and subsequently with a potential photon / axion mixing in each of them , we can derive a total conversion probability @xcite as follows :    @xmath24 \\label{eq : totalprob}\\ ] ]    where @xmath25 is given by eq.([eq : p0 ] ) and @xmath26 represents the number of domains .",
    "note that in the limit where @xmath27 , the total probability saturates to 1/3 , i.e. one third of the photons will convert into alps .",
    "it is useful here to rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : p0 ] ) following ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e.    @xmath28\\ ] ]    so that we can define a characteristic energy , @xmath29 , given by : @xmath30    or in more convenient units : @xmath31    where the subindices refer again to dimensionless quantities : @xmath32 , @xmath33 gev and @xmath34 b / gauss ; @xmath35 is the effective alp mass @xmath36 .",
    "recent results from the cast experiment @xcite give a value of @xmath37 for axion mass @xmath38 ev .",
    "although there are other limits derived with other methods or experiments , the cast bound is the most general and stringent limit in the range @xmath39 ev @xmath40 ev .    in order to have an efficient conversion , we need @xcite : @xmath41 where s@xmath42 s / parsec . some astrophysical environments fulfill the above mixing requirement and the m@xmath43 constraints imposed by cast . indeed , when using @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : effconv ] ) , we can deduce that astrophysical sources with b@xmath44 0.01 will be valid .",
    "this product b@xmath45 also determines the maximum energy e@xmath46 to which sources can accelerate cosmic rays , and is given by e@xmath47 b@xmath48 ev ( hillas criterium ) .",
    "since we observe cosmic rays up to 3 @xmath49 10@xmath50 ev , b@xmath51  s@xmath52 can be as high as 0.3 , which also means that sources with b@xmath53 0.01 are completely plausible and should exist .",
    "therefore , photon / axion mixing may have important implications for astronomical observations ( agns , pulsars , grbs ... ) .",
    "note , however , that an efficient mixing can be expected to occur not only in compact sources : the mixing will be also present in the intergalactic magnetic fields ( igmfs ) , with typical values of @xmath541 ng for the b field , provided that the source is located at cosmological distances ( s@xmath55 ) in order to ensure that b @xmath56 is still larger than 0.01 .",
    "therefore , in order to correctly evaluate the photon / axion mixing effect for distant sources , it will be necessary to handle under the same consistent framework the mixing that takes place inside or near the gamma - ray sources together with that one expected to occur in the igmf . in the literature , both effects have been considered separately .",
    "we neglect , however , the mixing that may happen inside the milky way due to galactic magnetic fields.3% of the initial photon flux emitted by the source @xcite . ]      to illustrate how the photon / axion mixing inside the source works , we show in figure  [ fig : sourcemix ] an example for an agn modeled by the parameters listed in table  [ tab:3c279 ] .",
    "the only difference is the use of an alp mass of 1 @xmath57ev instead of the value that appears in that table , so that we can obtain a critical energy that lies in the gev energy range ; indeed , we get @xmath58 gev according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : ecrit ] ) .",
    "note that the main effect just above @xmath29 is an _ attenuation _ of the total expected flux coming from the source.10 gev ) gradually , the reason being the crucial role of the cotton - mouton term , which makes the efficiency of the source mixing to decrease as the energy increases . see ref .",
    "@xcite for details . ]          as already discussed , despite the low magnetic field * b * , the photon / axion oscillation can take place in the igmfs due to the large distances .",
    "however , the strength of the igmfs is expected to be many orders of magnitude weaker ( @xmath54ng ) than that of the source and its surroundings ( @xmath54 g ) . consequently , as described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ecrit ] ) , the energy at which photon / axion oscillation occurs in this case is many orders of magnitude larger than that at which oscillation can occur in the source and its vicinity . assuming a mid - value of b@xmath540.1 ng , and @xmath59 ( cast upper limit )",
    ", the effect could be observationally detectable by current iacts ( @xmath60  tev ) only if the alp mass is m@xmath61 ev , i.e. we need ultra - light alps . for example , we get @xmath62 gev when using m@xmath63 ev , which is the value given in table [ tab:3c279 ] as our reference one .    .[tab:3c279 ] [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]         in our model , we assume that the photon beam propagates over n domains of a given length , the modulus of the magnetic field roughly constant in each of them .",
    "we take , however , randomly chosen orientations , which in practice is also equivalent to a variation in the strength of the component of the magnetic field involved in the photon / axion mixing .",
    "moreover , it will be necessary to include the effect of the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) in the equations as well , its main effect being an additional attenuation of the photon flux , especially at energies above 100 gev .",
    "indeed , the ebl plays a crucial role to correctly evaluate and understand the importance of the intergalactic mixing .",
    "the induced effect can be an _ attenuation _ or an _ enhancement _ of the photon flux at earth , depending on distance , magnetic field and the ebl model considered ( see next section ) .      in conclusion , agns located at cosmological distances will be affected by both mixing in the source and in the igmf .",
    "as already mentioned , up to now previous works have focused only in studying the photon / axion mixing either inside the source or in the igmfs . instead , for the first time we carried out a detailed study of the mixing in both regimes under the same consistent framework .",
    "in order to observe both effects in the gamma - ray band , we need ultra - light alps . that is the reason why in our fiducial model , presented in table  [ tab:3c279 ] , we use a value of m@xmath63 ev , which implies @xmath64 30 gev for the igmf mixing ( for b@xmath540.1  ng ) and @xmath64 1  ev within the source and its vicinity ( b@xmath541  g ) .",
    "consequently , both effects need to be taken into account .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] a diagram that outlines our formalism .",
    "very squematically , the diagram shows the travel of a photon from the source to the earth in a scenario with alps . in the same figure",
    ", we show the main physical cases that one could identify inside our formalism : mixing in both the source and the igmf , mixing in only one of these environments , the effect of the ebl , etc .",
    "since we expect the intergalactic mixing to be more important for larger distances , due to the more prominent role of the ebl , we chose two distant astrophysical sources as our benchmark agns : the radio quasar 3c  279 ( z=0.536 ) and the bl lac pks  2155 - 304 at z=0.117 .",
    "we summarize in table [ tab:3c279 ] the parameters we have considered in order to calculate the total photon / axion conversion in both the source and in the intergalactic medium . as for the ebl model",
    ", we chose the primack @xcite and kneiske best - fit @xcite ones .",
    "they represent respectively one of the most transparent and one of the most opaque models for gamma - rays , but still within the limits imposed by the observations .         +            in order to quantitatively study the effect of alps on the total photon intensity , we plot in figure  [ fig : boosts ] the difference between the predicted arriving photon intensity without including alps and that one obtained when including the photon / axion oscillations ( called here the",
    "_ axion boost factor _ ) .",
    "this was done for our fiducial model ( table  [ tab:3c279 ] ) and for the two ebl models considered .",
    "the plots show differences in the axion boost factors obtained for 3c  279 and pks  2155 - 304 due mostly to the redshift difference .",
    "the inferred critical energies for the mixing in the source are @xmath65 ev for 3c  279 and @xmath66 ev for pks 2155 - 304 , while for the mixing in the intergalactic medium we obtain @xmath67 gev ( the same for both objects ) . for b@xmath680.1",
    "ng , and in the case of 3c  279 , the axion boost is an attenuation of about 16% below the critical energy ( due to mixing inside the source ) . above this critical energy and below 200 - 300 gev , where the ebl attenuation is still small",
    ", there is an extra attenuation of about 30% ( mixing in the igmf ) . above 200 - 300",
    "gev the axion boost reaches very high values : at 1 tev , a factor of @xmath547 for the primack ebl model and @xmath54340 for the kneiske best - fit model .",
    "we find that the more attenuating the ebl model considered , the more relevant the effect of photon / axion oscillations in the igmf , since any alp to photon reconversion might substantially enhance the intensity arriving at earth . in the case of pks  2155 - 304 , the situation is different from that of 3c  279 due to the very low photon - attenuation at the source and , mostly , due to the smaller source distance .",
    "furthermore , a very interesting result is found when varying the modulus of the intergalactic magnetic field .",
    "higher @xmath69 values do not necessarily translate into higher photon flux enhancements .",
    "there is always a @xmath69 value that maximizes the axion boost factors ; this value is sensitive to the source distance , the considered energy and the ebl adopted model ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion on this issue ) .",
    "if we accurately knew the intrinsic spectrum of the sources and/or the density of the ebl , we should be able to observationally detect axion signatures or to exclude some portions of the parameter space .",
    "we lack this knowledge , so detection is challenging but we believe that still possible .",
    "the combination of the fermi / lat instrument and the iacts , which cover 6 decades in energy ( from 20 mev to 20 tev ) is very well suited to study the photon / axion mixing effect . nevertheless , and before assuming an scenario with axions to interpret the observational data , we should try to describe the observational data ( preferably several agns located at different redshifts , as well as the same agn undergoing different flaring states , from radio to tev ) with `` conventional '' theoretical models for the agn emission and for the ebl . if these `` conventional '' models for the source emission and ebl fail ( i.e. if we have important residuals for the best - fit model )",
    ", then the axion scenario should be explored .",
    "[ fig : obs ] summarizes what could be a good observational strategy to look for alps with fermi and iacts .",
    "recent gamma observations might already pose substantial challenges to the conventional models to explain the observed source spectra and/or ebl density , e.g. :    * the veritas collaboration recently claimed a detection above 0.1 tev coming from 3c66a ( z@xmath680.444 ) .",
    "the ebl - corrected spectrum seems to be harder than 1.5 @xcite .",
    "* tev photons coming from 3c 66a ?",
    "( see refs .",
    "if so , difficult to explain with conventional ebl models and physics . * the lower limit on the ebl at 3.6",
    "@xmath57 m was recently revised upwards by a factor @xmath542 , suggesting a more opaque universe @xcite .",
    "* some sources at z @xmath68 0.1 - 0.2 seem to have harder intrinsic energy spectra than previously anticipated @xcite .    while it is still possible to explain these observations with conventional physics , the axion / photon oscillation would naturally explain these puzzles , since we get more high energy photons than expected as well as a softer intrinsic spectrum in a scenario with alps .",
    "an example is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : axionsfriends ] ( from ref .  ) , where the effect of the existence of alps in the intrinsic spectrum of 3c  279 is shown assuming the fiducial model presented in table [ tab:3c279 ] and a kneiske best - fit ebl model .",
    "if axions exist , then they could distort the spectra of astrophysical sources importantly .",
    "in addition , if photon / axion mixing occurs in the igmfs , then a mixing in the source will be at work as well .",
    "in particular , for axion masses of the order or 10@xmath70 ev , the induced effect is expected to be present in the gamma ray energy range .    since photon / axion mixing in both the source and the igm",
    "are expected to be at work over several decades in energy , it is clear that a joint effort of fermi and current iacts is needed .",
    "the fermi / lat instrument is expected to play a key role , since it will detect thousands of agns ( up to z@xmath545 ) , at energies where the ebl is not important . by the other hand , iacts will be specially important at higher energies ( @xmath71300 gev ) , where the ebl is present .",
    "main caveats : the effect of photon / axion oscillations could be attributed to conventional physics in the source and/or propagation of the gamma - rays towards the earth .",
    "we believe that detailed observations of agns at different redshifts and different flaring states could be successfully used to identify the signature of an effective photon / axion mixing .    99 snchez - conde m.  a. , paneque d. , bloom e. , prada f. and domnguez a. , 2009 , _ phys .",
