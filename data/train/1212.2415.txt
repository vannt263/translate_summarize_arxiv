    "image - based face recognition systems can be categorized into two categories , that is , holistic based recognition system and feature - based recognition system [ 1 - 2 ] . in this section ,",
    "we consider previous works which were proposed to suppress the influence of illumination variation in feature - based face recognition .    face recognition based on the local information such as gabor wavelet features in feature points has advantage that recognition is not sensitive to the variation of head pose or illumination , compared to the holistic based recognition such as eigenfaces , fisherfaces , ica(independent component analysis ) and hmm(hidden markov model ) [ 4 - 7 ] .",
    "different models and methods were proposed to support local feature - based face recognition , such as aam(active appearance model ) , lbp(local binary pattern ) and ebgm(elastic bunch graph matching ) [ 8 - 18 ] .",
    "aam is a geometrical and statistical model of face image , which is obtained by applying pca or lda to feature vectors consisting of coordinate and gray level intensity of feature points .",
    "lbp is a method to represent face image using binary vectors corresponding to each pixel , which are constructed by comparing pixel value of each pixel enclosing a pixel with the value of center pixel .",
    "many training data and time are needed to construct aam or lbp - based classifier .",
    "ebgm is a matching method using gabor wavelet features extracted from the face graph reflecting topological structure of human faces , where face graph is constructed by connecting landmarks ( node ) of face with edges [ 14 ] .",
    "each node of face graph has 40-dimensional gabor wavelet coefficient vector corresponding to 5 frequencies and 8 directions .",
    "ebgm - based face recognition has drawback that estimation of landmarks and extraction of gabor wavelet coefficients are influenced by the illumination variation . to overcome such a weakness of ebgm",
    ", some researchers tried to develop techniques which can decrease the effect of illumination variation by applying normalization or dct(discrete cosine transform ) to the input image [ 16 - 18 ] .",
    "however , it is still difficult to remove the effect of local illumination variation simultaneously with global illumination , though their methods make it possible to suppress the effect of global illumination variation to a certain degree .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a method extracting gabor wavelet features and discriminant feature points from face image , which is robust against local illumination variation and shows high recognition efficiency .",
    "feret and yaleb are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods .",
    "in this section , we describe a method extracting gabor wavelet features from face images , which is robust against local illumination variation .",
    "let @xmath0 be an face image , where @xmath1 .",
    "gabor wavelet transformation of @xmath0 is defined as follows [ 14 , 16 ] .",
    "@xmath2    here , @xmath3,\\\\ \\end{array}\\ ] ]    @xmath4    @xmath5    @xmath6 the second term in the integral of @xmath7 makes the kernel dc - free , that is , @xmath8 .",
    "the vector consisting of coefficients of gabor wavelet transformation corresponding to each orientation and frequency for each point of face image is called jet and denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 can be calculated as shown in eq.2 by considering the fact that @xmath10 only depends on the points belonging to the neighborhood @xmath11 of @xmath12 from the property of kernel function @xmath13 and the characteristics of the calculation of gabor wavelet coefficients .",
    "@xmath14    @xmath11 is a small area compared to the input face image and therefore we can assume that gray level intensity of face image changes linearly according to the brightness and contrast of illumination in this area , i.e. ,    @xmath15    here , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the average and standard deviation of gray level intensity in local area @xmath18 , and express brightness and contrast of illumination . from eq.2 and eq.3 , we can calculate @xmath19 as follows .",
    "+   + @xmath20 + @xmath21 + @xmath22 + + @xmath23 +   + here , @xmath24 and @xmath25 + @xmath26 , because the size of @xmath11 changes depending on only @xmath27 , not @xmath12 .",
    "thus , the following equation holds .",
    "@xmath28    we can think that @xmath29 is not influenced by the illumination variation because local illumination variation will appears only as the change of values of @xmath16 and @xmath17 . by using @xmath29 as the gabor wavelet coefficients instead of @xmath19",
    ", we can achieve the effect of normalization of local illumination variation .",
    "@xmath29 can be calculated as follows .",
    "in [ 19 ] , authors proposed a method for selecting feature points using discriminant vector , but it is hard to say that it gives most discriminant points for gabor wavelet features .",
    "linear discriminant analysis is a method to find out subspace in which the separability of classes becomes maximum , where the separability of classes is defined as the ratio of between - class variation to within - class variation [ 20 - 23 ] .",
    "it can be considered that the points having big separability of classes are the most discriminant points when selecting feature point .",
    "we calculate separability of classes using gabor wavelet coefficient vector @xmath31 for each point and select the points whose separability of classes are big as feature points for the extraction of jet . here , gabor wavelet coefficients only use magnitude and neglect phase component , i.e. , @xmath32 .",
    "let @xmath33 and @xmath34 be the within - class / between - class scatter matrix by considering feature vector @xmath31 of fixed point @xmath12 as a random vector . then , the value @xmath35 of the separability of classes for each @xmath36 is calculated as follows [ 20 ] .",
    "@xmath37    we select @xmath38 as the candidate set for feature points , where @xmath39 is a threshold .",
    "absolute value @xmath40 of gabor wavelet coefficient does not change largely in the neighborhood of @xmath12 and thus correlation between feature vectors becomes large and value of @xmath35 becomes similar .",
    "this implies that the points of @xmath41 are mainly placed in the neighborhoods of extreme points of the function @xmath42 . to increase recognition rate , however , it is important not only to select feature points having big separability of classes but also to make the correlation between feature vectors small as possible .",
    "thus , we finally select the points from @xmath41 , which have a less correlation each other , using correlation between feature vectors and k - means clustering algorithm .",
    "selection algorithm is describe below .",
    "let @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 denote the number of groups , the number of step and the maximum repeat count .",
    "let @xmath46 be the @xmath47-th group in step @xmath44 . here , @xmath48 .",
    "and let @xmath49be the center of @xmath47-th group in stpe @xmath44 .",
    "+ @xmath50 : initialize parameters @xmath44 and @xmath51 as @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath54 : reassign points @xmath55 to group @xmath56 . here",
    ", @xmath57 is decided as follows .",
    "@xmath58    @xmath59 : if @xmath60 and there is a point @xmath61 which is reassigned , then increase @xmath44 one and recalculate @xmath49 and go to step 2 .",
    "the center @xmath49 of group @xmath62 is calculated using the equation described below , where @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath64    _ step4 _ : if the above condition is not satisfied , then @xmath65 is the set of feature points .",
    "finish algorithm .",
    "fa , fb , fc , d1 , d2 ( 3539 images ) of feret and yaleb ( 4500 face images , 10 persons ) are used for experiment .",
    "the purpose of the experiment is to confirm that recognition performance is increased in fc under illumination variation and yaleb , but do nt decrease in fb , d1 and d2 , compared to the previous methods , when we apply the method of the paper . for the experiment , 128@xmath66128 image extracted from the image where the position of eyes are given .",
    "the sum of similarities between jets is used as the similarity for performance estimation [ 14 ] .",
    "table 1 shows the recognition performance according to the number of feature points , when the method of paper is applied . as we can see in the table ,",
    "recognition performance does not increase when the number of feature points is greater than 50 .",
    "table 2 shows the result of comparison between the method of paper and egbm in case that the number of feature points is 50 . as we can know from the table , it is possible to remove performance degradation which is caused by the incorrect extraction of feature points under serious illumination variation ( yaleb ) , if we apply the method of paper .",
    "however , if we fix landmark , the performance is decreased in case that there is no serious illumination variation .    table 3 shows recognition performances in case that we use @xmath10 and @xmath29 as wavelet feature coefficients respectively . as we can see in the table ,",
    "normalization of the paper demonstrates high recognition performance without being affected by the illumination variation even in case that there is a change of facial expression or aging",
