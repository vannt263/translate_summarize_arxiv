    "according to @xmath4cdm simulations , dark matter is expected to dominate baryonic matter on both galactic and cluster scales .",
    "observations , including x - ray studies , gravitational lensing and rotational velocity curve measurements , also suggest that the luminous matter is only a fraction of the total matter in the universe , although it dominates the dark matter in the innermost regions of galaxies and clusters . understanding the nature of dark matter is one of the key challenges in modern astrophysics .",
    "in particular , a knowledge of the spatial distribution of the dark matter is crucial for understanding its interplay with the baryonic matter and gaining insight into its nature .",
    "the dark matter distributions for halos from @xmath4cdm simulations are usually described by the navarro , frenk , & white ( nfw ) profile @xcite , but recently @xcite found a better fit using a srsic profile for the 3d density distribution . that work was expanded in @xcite which found that the srsic distribution also provides a good fit to the 2d distribution of dark matter halos and found the deprojected srsic profile to give the best fit to the 3d distribution .",
    "it is intriguing that the srsic law , which is often fit to the 2d luminosity profiles of elliptical galaxies @xcite , should also describe the surface density profiles of dark matter halos from simulations .",
    "in fact , work by e.g. @xcite suggests that the srsic profile provides a better fit in particular to the inner regions of dark matter halos , where the dm density profile affects the kinematics of the central galaxies in these halos more strongly . as lensing",
    "can probe the surface density profiles of galaxies ( see e.g. , @xcite ) and clusters ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , especially in their central regions , it is of interest to compare the lensing properties of the srsic and the nfw profiles ; does the use of an nfw profile for lensing mass reconstructions introduce a significant bias given an actual srsic lens profile , or are the two essentially indistinguishable for lensing mass reconstructions ?",
    "the question of the slope for the inner profile in lens systems like galaxies and clusters has been addressed by several authors before @xcite .",
    "others have predicted and/or attempted to reconstruct the slope of lensing systems from the observed positions and magnifications of multiply - imaged sources @xcite . in this work",
    ", we take a very theoretically motivated approach : given either an nfw or srsic profile for dark mass distributions , how would their lensing properties differ ?",
    "we thereby neglect the fact that in actual lens systems , the lensing mass also includes a baryonic component that is parameterised in a different way .",
    "even if the stellar mass component of early - type galaxies can also be described by a srsic profile , the scale length and central densities are very different than those found in simulations for the srsic profiles for the dark matter component .",
    "the work presented here therefore only describes the _ difference _ in lensing properties between nfw and srsic profiles if the total mass distribution can be described by a single srsic profile . for cluster systems ,",
    "the dark matter component is a more significant contributor to the lensing properties and the baryonic component plays a smaller role than for galaxy lens systems . in this sense",
    "the results in our paper are more readily compared with current lensing constraints on the dark matter profiles of clusters .",
    "the analytical lensing relations derived in section 2 are , however applicable to all lens systems that can be described by a srsic profile , irrespective of the scale and whether the matter is baryonic or dark .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume standard @xmath4cdm cosmology with @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) . for numerical lensing calculations we place the lens at a redshift of @xmath10 ( a realistic redshift for both galaxy and cluster lenses ) and the source at @xmath11 ( chosen to approximate a source at @xmath12 ,",
    "although we note that for any @xmath13 the results are similar ) . for the given cosmology , @xmath14 corresponds to @xmath15  kpc at @xmath10 .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : we start by introducing the nfw and the srsic profiles in the remainder of section 1 . in section 2",
    "we derive and discuss the magnification properties of the srsic profile . in section 3",
    "we study and discuss the differences in the lensing properties of a srsic surface matter density and a corresponding best fitting nfw .",
    "we study whether applying an nfw fit to an underlying srsic profile leads to a bias in the mass and concentration parameter and discuss the implications our results could have on modelling of observed lenses .",
    "we summarise our conclusions in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the nfw profile @xcite has been extensively used to fit @xmath4cdm halos from simulations and in 3d is given by : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the ( 3d ) scale radius , @xmath18 is a dimensionless number called the concentration parameter , @xmath19 is the critical ( 3d ) density at the redshift of the halo , @xmath1 is the radius inside which the mass density of the halo equals @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the characteristic over - density for the halo given by @xmath22    the 2d projection of the nfw profile is frequently used in the modelling of gravitational lenses @xcite .",
    "it is found by integrating equation ( [ eq : ro_nfw ] ) along the line of sight , giving @xmath23 and the shear is given by @xmath24 \\nonumber \\label{eq : nfw_shear}\\ ] ] with @xmath25 where @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "these lensing relations of the nfw have previously been studied and can also be found in e.g. @xcite .      the srsic law for surface density profiles is given by @xmath27,\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the 2d density , @xmath29 is the 2d radius , @xmath30 is the srsic index , @xmath31 is a constant chosen such that @xmath32 is the radius containing one - half of the projected mass and @xmath33 is the density at @xmath32 .",
    "the constant @xmath31 is found by solving the equation @xmath34 and can be approximated as @xmath35 @xcite . with @xmath36",
    "the srsic profile reduces to the de vaucouleurs profile , whereas @xmath37 gives the exponential law . a previous study of the lensing properties of the srsic profile focussed on @xmath38@xcite . in @xcite",
    "the mass distribution of dwarf- and galaxy - sized halos has a mean of @xmath39 but @xmath40 for cluster - sized halos with values as low as @xmath41 .",
    "we begin by calculating the total magnification , @xmath42 , for the srsic profile . from standard equations for gravitational lensing @xcite",
    "we have : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the convergence and @xmath45 is the critical mass density , which depends on the angular diameter distances to the source ( @xmath46 ) , the lens ( @xmath47 ) and between the source and the lens ( @xmath48 ) , @xmath49 is the speed of light in vacuum and @xmath50 is the gravitational constant . for a spherically symmetric mass profile ,",
    "the shear @xmath51 can be calculated as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the mean surface mass density as a function of radius @xcite .    applying this to the srsic profile , we find @xmath54^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath55,\\ ] ] @xmath56\\frac{\\gamma[2n]-\\gamma[2n , b_n y^{1/n}]}{y^2}\\ ] ] and @xmath57 .",
    "we see from equation ( [ eq : muser ] ) that the srsic profile has two sets of critical curves ( i.e. curves in the lens plane where the magnification formally goes to infinity ) , which are defined by @xmath58 ( tangential critical curve ) and @xmath59 ( radial critical curve ) .",
    "these equations define two rings and the radii can be found by solving the equations numerically .",
    "the larger of the rings , given by @xmath60 , is the so called einstein ring .",
    "its radius is called the einstein radius , @xmath61 , which , for the spherical profiles considered here , corresponds to the radius at which the mean surface density equals the critical surface density .",
    "figure  [ fig : muser ] ( solid lines ) shows a plot of the magnification as a function of radius for different values of n and constant @xmath62 and @xmath32 .",
    "we can see that the two critical curves move further apart for steeper profiles , and correspondingly , that the lowest magnification between them decreases .",
    "our result is not in agreement with those of @xcite , who only found tangential critical curves when studying lensing properties of the srsic profile for @xmath38 .",
    "we find that this discrepancy is due to a sign error in the calculations of @xcite and we note that , provided there is a tangential critical curve at @xmath63 , there will always be a radial critical curve for the srsic profile .",
    "this is because @xmath64 and @xmath65 and as both @xmath66 and @xmath67 are continuous functions , there must exist an @xmath68 where a radial critical curve will occur .",
    "in this section we compare the lensing properties of the srsic and the nfw profiles .",
    "we use the srsic 2d mass profile as an input , and find a corresponding nfw which gives the best reproduction of the lensing constraints , as described below . following @xcite , values of @xmath69",
    "kpc with @xmath70 are representative parameter values for galaxy sized halos , while @xmath71  kpc with @xmath72 are a realistic parameter range for the srsic profile for cluster - sized halos , with lower @xmath30 being found for more massive clusters ( which are more likely to act as lenses ) . in particular , we take @xmath73  kpc for cluster sized halos as input parameters for our simulations .",
    "the third input parameter , @xmath74 , has a minimum value for strong lensing to occur , i.e. @xmath75 .",
    "typical einstein radii for galaxies are of the order of @xmath76 @xcite , while for clusters they are of the order of @xmath77 with the largest known einstein radius to date being @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "we will therefore constrain our input srsic profiles to have einstein radii in this range , and for each given einstein radii we will vary @xmath30 and @xmath79 , while @xmath74 is calculated from the three input parameters @xmath80 and @xmath79 .",
    "our goal is to study whether strong lensing data of an accuracy currently available can be well fitted by an nfw profile even if the lensing mass distribution actually follows a srsic profile . in particular , we wish to explore whether the corresponding nfw can reproduce the strong lensing data , and if so , what the parameters of the nfw profile are and how these relate to typical nfw parameter values obtained for simulated cluster halos .",
    "therefore we choose to take a srsic profile as our assumed input and will fit for the corresponding nfw profile given certain constraints .",
    "the constraints from strong lensing are in general the einstein radius , relative locations of the images and their magnification ratio , which are all sensitive to the mass distribution within the disc defined by the outermost image . of these the einstein radius ( deduced from the total separation of the multiple images )",
    "is the best constrained value , while the precise location of images can be affected by nearby substructure and the magnification ratio can be biased by both microlensing and dust extinction in the lensing galaxy @xcite .",
    "the inner critical curve may also give additional constraints on the mass profile if central images or merging radial arcs are observed .",
    "under the assumption of spherical symmetry , time delay measurements between images provide a further constraint on the mass in an annulus , bounded by the radii of each of the images , but are hard to measure , in particular in strong cluster lensing where most of the known lensed images are background galaxies and not quasars .",
    "we choose two main approaches to the fitting .",
    "the first approach assumes that we have multiple systems at different redshifts allowing for constraints on the total mass within a number of radii .",
    "this approach reflects the common situation that several arc systems are used to constrain the lensing mass distribution of clusters @xcite .",
    "the second approach assumes that only a single einstein ring is detected and used for the lensing analysis @xcite . in this case",
    "we fix the einstein radii of the two profiles to be the same , and fit the inner mass density profile as described below in section 3.1 .",
    "this choice is motivated mainly by the fact that the einstein radius is easy to constrain accurately observationally and that the magnification of multiply imaged arcs and arclets in strong lensing clusters constrain the surface mass density on a scale given by the einstein radius .      for the case",
    "when only one einstein ring is used to constrain the system , the fit is underconstrained , so we must choose an additional constraint on the nfw profile that relates it to the input srsic profile .",
    "since the magnification and shear for a series of observed extended and highly magnified arcs of the same source is sensitive to the surface mass density in the inner regions of the cluster , we require that the nfw profile fits the input srsic projected mass distribution in an inner region bounded by @xmath61 with the einstein radius itself as a constraint .",
    "the fitting itself is done numerically , using levenberg - marquardt least - squares minimisation . as our primary mode of fitting , we take the srsic surface mass density profile at @xmath81 points , linearly distributed from @xmath82 to @xmath83 , and applying a constant relative error in each of the points . to check the dependence of the results on our precise choice of fitting ,",
    "we try several other fitting methods consistent with the previously described framework .",
    "in particular , we redo the analysis using fits where we distribute the points differently , where we fit @xmath84 instead of @xmath85 , and where we alter the weight of the points , giving more emphasis to different regions .",
    "for example , instead of distributing the points over @xmath86 , we constrain the fit to a tight area around the einstein radius ( @xmath87 ) or to an area around the einstein radius and the inner critical curve of the srsic profile .",
    "in addition we changed the absolute weights of the points to be equal , putting an emphasis on the inner points ( where we have less constraints from lensing ) .",
    "although the detailed shape of the best fitting nfw profile varies depending on the choice of fitting ( see figure [ fig : sigma ] for a plot of the @xmath88 from two fits for @xmath41 and @xmath89 ) , and we note that we do not constrain whether the profile is very cuspy or not in the very centre as could be done using central images as constraint , the analysis presented in the rest of the paper remains qualitatively the same .",
    "this leads us to conclude that the precise method of fitting we use does not affect our conclusions .",
    "when we have multiple einstein radii , we have enough constraints to find the best fitting nfw without additional constraints .",
    "as each einstein radii gives an estimate of the mass of the system within that radius , we fit the mass profile ( rather than the mass density profile ) of the nfw to the mass profile of the input srsic profile .",
    "we assume that we have 9 independent systems at distances of @xmath90-@xmath91  kpc for a cluster sized lens @xcite .",
    "we set the uncertainty of the mass estimated at each of the points to be @xmath92 , corresponding roughly to the level of current observational accuracy .",
    "we find that the results from the lensing analysis remain qualitatively the same as for our fitting of a single einstein radius .",
    "the figures in the paper are based on the single einstein radius constraint , fitting @xmath85 in the range of @xmath86 using the @xmath93 weighting , unless otherwise noted .",
    "figure  [ fig : rein ] shows @xmath61 as function of @xmath30 for different values of @xmath79 .",
    "the figure shows that @xmath61 is a strong function of @xmath32 and @xmath30 for low values of @xmath30 , while for the higher range of @xmath30 the values level off .",
    "a similar plot may be obtained keeping @xmath79 constant and varying @xmath74 , which shows @xmath61 increasing with @xmath74 . as explained above , our interest in the strong lensing properties of the srsic profile as compared to the nfw profile motivates us to either fix the einstein radius or fit for the total mass at multiple einstein radii when making further comparisons . in the following figures",
    "the einstein radius is set to @xmath94 , corresponding to a cluster sized halo , but all the results presented also apply to systems with different einstein radii ( e.g. galaxies ) and to systems with measurements of several einstein radii corresponding to multiple sources .    fitting an nfw profile to a srsic lens will not always give a good fit to the data .",
    "in fact , given that the number of parameters of the nfw is less than that of the srsic one does not expect a good fit in general .",
    "different indices @xmath30 of the srsic profile correspond to different slopes in the inner mass profile , whereas the slope of the nfw profile is not a free parameter .    in fig.[fig :",
    "chi ] we show the goodness of fit , the @xmath95 normalised with the lowest @xmath95 in the ensemble .",
    "as expected , good fits ( low values of @xmath95 ) are obtained only for a small region around a specific value of @xmath30 .",
    "we note , however , that in most lensing analysis an nfw profile is assumed and the best - fit parameters are obtained , even if the actual @xmath95 is high . in such cases ,",
    "our results suggest that a fit using a srsic profile should be used instead and will give a much better fit if the underlying profile is in fact a srsic .",
    "figure  [ fig : rs_comp ] shows how the best - fit nfw scale length varies with the input srsic parameters .",
    "higher values of @xmath30 give rise to steeper profiles and hence a lower value for the scale length @xmath96 of the best - fit nfw profile .      in figure",
    "[ fig : muser ] we overplot the magnification for the best fit nfw profile for @xmath97 and constant @xmath79 and @xmath74 ( note that for this plot we do not keep @xmath61 constant ) .",
    "the figure shows that the difference in the magnification properties is not very large , except for @xmath41 . for @xmath98 ,",
    "the fits are very similar , whereas for @xmath99 the main difference lies in the location of the inner critical lines .",
    "the exact location of the inner critical lines depends to some extent also on our choice of fitting , and is therefore not a very robust measurement of differences in the two profiles .",
    "in addition , the inner critical line is usually observationally less well determined than the einstein radius . measurements of different einstein radii , due to sources at different redshifts , are a more common and practical additional constraint on the inner mass profile . we found that constraining the mass profiles in this way at several different einstein radii results in very similar magnification profiles .    for a more quantitative analysis of the magnification differences ,",
    "we define @xmath100 as the ratio the area on the source plane where magnified images ( i.e. images with @xmath101 ) with magnification greater or equal to @xmath42 occur .",
    "taking @xmath61 to be constant , in figure  [ fig : mag ] we plot @xmath100 calculated over an area in the source plane , corresponding to @xmath102 times @xmath102 in the image plane ( shown for the srsic profile in figure  [ fig : plot_images ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : mag ] shows that the difference in the magnification is indeed small , although for @xmath41 the nfw profile is more likely to produce highly magnified images , whereas for higher @xmath30 the reverse is true to a smaller degree . as the difference in the magnification properties of the srsic and the best fitting nfw profiles is small , our results demonstrate that , given current observational accuracy , an nfw profile is adequate to describe the magnification for these strong lensing systems .",
    "in many strong gravitational lens systems the observed images do not lie exactly on the einstein radius , but are displaced in an asymmetric fashion ; one image being within the einstein radius and another outside . to illustrate the difference between srsic and nfw models we show the image displacements in fig.[fig : plot_images ] for two different choices of the source position . for a fixed source position , the image positions for the best - fitting nfw profile is indistinguishable from that of the srsic profile for high @xmath30 , while for low values of @xmath30 , there is a slight offset between the image positions , in line with the findings from above : nfw profiles produce very similar lensing signatures to srsic profiles , and are distinguishable only for low values of the srsic index @xmath103 unless the goodness of fit can be used to separate the profiles .",
    "lensing , both strong and weak , is frequently used to estimate the mass and the nfw concentration parameter of clusters , which are then compared to those from simulations or x - ray measurements , with lensing usually finding a higher mass and concentration @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to study whether an underlying srsic profile could cause a bias in the mass and @xmath49 estimate , if an nfw profile is assumed in the strong lensing modelling . as strong lensing is only sensitive at small radii , one should keep in mind when making these comparison , that a small deviation in the assumed profile can lead to large errors in both the mass and concentration parameter .",
    "however , although weak lensing should be more accurate for such comparisons as it probes a similar distance scale , it is very sensitive to contamination of the background galaxy catalogue by cluster members .",
    "in fact , @xcite find for abell 1689 , that the concentration parameter derived from strong lensing is consistent between different data sets and methods , while that derived from weak lensing still shows large scatter which are an artefact of the method applied .    in fig.[fig",
    ": mass_comp ] we show the ratio of the projected masses for the input srsic and the best - fit nfw within @xmath1 ( of the nfw profile ) .",
    "the mass ratio depends most strongly on the srsic index @xmath30 . roughly speaking",
    ", a higher value of @xmath30 gives rise to lower projected masses for the corresponding nfw fits .",
    "therefore , applying an nfw profile to a srsic lens can lead to a significant error in the mass estimation , with the mass at @xmath1 being overestimated by a factor of @xmath2 for low @xmath30 .",
    "similarly , figure  [ fig : c_comp ] shows the concentration parameter of the best fit nfw profile as a function of the srsic index @xmath30 and scale @xmath32 .",
    "the figure shows how the concentration parameters increase mostly with increasing @xmath30 from very low concentrations to @xmath104 for high @xmath30 .",
    "extreme values of the concentration parameter ( i.e. @xmath105 or @xmath106 ) , can be found and correspond to the input srsic parameters where the nfw fit is worse and where the mass estimate is biased ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : chi ] and [ fig : mass_comp ] ) .    therefore applying an nfw profile to an underlying srsic profile ,",
    "can lead to wrong mass estimates .",
    "for cluster sized halos with @xmath0 , fitting lensing data with an nfw profile would give values of @xmath49 which would be lower than those expected when compared to cdm simulations .",
    "such low values of @xmath49 have been found in strong lensing analysis , although in general lensing overpredicts @xmath49 compared to x - ray measurements @xcite . for higher values of @xmath30 ,",
    "this trend gets reversed : for @xmath107 concentration parameters of nfw fits are higher than those seen in simulations .",
    "however , such high values of @xmath30 are not expected to describe cluster size halos , but galaxy scaled halos @xcite .",
    "observationally it is thus likely that nfw lens models of clusters that give rise to mass or concentrations which seem inconsistent or only marginally consistent with simulations or x - ray measurements would be better described by a srsic profile .",
    "we stress that these results are consistent for all the fitting methods we apply , and whether we apply one or several sets of einstein radii as constraints .",
    "we have focused on comparing the difference in the strong lensing properties of the srsic and the nfw profiles , making @xmath61 the most relevant distance scale . a thorough analysis of the difference in the weak lensing properties of the two profiles would require optimising the fits in the weak lensing regime and is beyond the scope of this paper",
    "however , we can compare the predicted total mass and the weak lensing shear @xmath51 in the weak lensing regime by extrapolating the derived functions to higher radii .",
    "we have already compared the projected mass within @xmath1 for different values of @xmath30 and @xmath79 ( see figure  [ fig : mass_comp ] ) , but here we study the nfw : srsic mass ratio as a function of radius for a halo with @xmath108  kpc and @xmath109  kpc , corresponding to a cluster sized halo . in figure",
    "[ fig : high_r_mass ] ,    we plot the difference in the projected mass over the projected mass of the srsic profile .",
    "we see that for @xmath41 , the best fitting nfw profile overestimates the mass by a factor of @xmath110 for @xmath111 , while it underestimates it by @xmath2 for @xmath112 .",
    "this is due to the fact that in order to fit the low @xmath41 srsic profiles , the estimated @xmath113 of the nfw ( the scale radius at which the density slope increases ) is overestimated , making the nfw profile fall off less steeply than expected in the outer regions .",
    "similarly ,    in figure  [ fig : high_r_gamma ] , we plot the difference in the projected shear @xmath51 as a function of radius .",
    "we find that for @xmath107 , the difference is of the order of @xmath114 while for @xmath41 it is of the order of @xmath115 . as weak lensing measurements of clusters",
    "are usually looking at shear signals around @xmath116 , this is a significant difference , in particular for the low @xmath30 . therefore , using an nfw to model an underlying srsic profile with low @xmath30 would significantly over predict the weak lensing signal at large radii , and , depending on the measurement errors , result in a poor fit .",
    "we have taken a srsic profile as the underlying description of the matter profile and studied how lensing analysis applying an nfw fit would differ and lead to biased results , depending on the input srsic index . in particular we have found that for @xmath0 the mass can be overestimated by a factor of two and give low concentration .",
    "we have however not addressed which profile is a better description of real dark matter halos .",
    "to do so , one should model a real system using the srsic profile and compare it to the results found when using an nfw profile .",
    "while such a study is beyond the scope of this paper , we discuss here the implications our results have on lens modelling of real systems .    for galaxy scale lenses ,",
    "various authors @xcite have established that lenses on average are well fitted by an isothermal profile , although there can be significant scatter for individual lenses @xcite .",
    "these all apply however to the _ total _ matter distribution , both luminous and dark , while we have been studying the differences for dark matter only profiles .",
    "more recent studies have attempted separating the dark and luminous matter profiles in lensing of galaxies @xcite , but in general the constraints from lensing alone are not sufficient for separating the two .",
    "group or cluster scale lenses , with which we are primarily concerned in this work , are more dark matter dominated .",
    "this means they are also better suited for an observational test of whether real clusters are better described by an nfw or a srsic profile .",
    "regarding observational strong lensing constraints the main observable is the total mass and the slope of the mass profile in the innermost ( strong lensing ) region of the cluster or group .",
    "the nfw and the srsic profile differ in that the srsic profile has an extra independent parameter , @xmath30 that directly relates to the inner slope of the mass distribution .",
    "even though the concentration parameter of the nfw profile is related to the slope of the profile , it is also related to the overall scale and mass of the cluster and is not an independent parameter . from an observational perspective",
    "the key quantities then are the slope and mass of the dark matter in the inner region of real clusters , and whether they are consistent with an nfw profile as expected from cdm simulations .",
    "as pointed out recently @xcite nfw fits to observed strong lensing clusters very often give masses or concentration parameters that seem inconsistent with cdm predictions . in general the trend is that observed clusters have higher concentration parameters than predicted in simulations  but some lensing clusters have also yielded very low concentration parameters when fit with an nfw profile ( e.g. ms1137.5 + 6625 @xcite and ms 2053.7 - 0449 @xcite )",
    ". clusters with unusually high or low concentration values may very well be fit much better with a srsic profile  since the einstein radius then becomes a function of @xmath30 , even for a fixed scale , @xmath32 , an index @xmath30 ( and hence slope ) and a total mass @xmath117 may be found that match the predicted shape of the mass profile from cdm more closely .",
    "it is important to note that the lensing fits of clusters are often quite poor , i.e. the @xmath95 is high or the rms of the predicted image position is larger than the uncertainty in their measured positions @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have compared the srsic and nfw dark matter surface density profiles with respect to their strong lensing properties . taking srsic profiles , with parameters that are in the range found for clusters and galaxies in large n - body simulations",
    ", we explored the parameters of the nfw profile that fits the inner projected surface mass density of the srsic best .",
    "the nfw profiles were constrained to have the same einstein radius as the input srsic profile , as this is the most accurately determined observable in lens systems . as an alternative approach ,",
    "we have assumed a data set consisting of several multiply imaged systems at different redshifts , giving a constraint on the mass profile at different radii .",
    "we find that an nfw profile can in general accurately produce the magnification and image positions of a srsic matter distribution only for @xmath107 . for lower srsic index values , which are more likely to occur in cluster sized halos , the difference in the lensing properties increases , to the level where it could affect results of lens modelling , in particular for the magnification estimates .",
    "we also note that although one can in general find an nfw profile which gives similar lensing properties , the parameters of the profile may become unrealistic . for @xmath0 ,",
    "as simulations suggest can be the case for clusters , the mass is overestimated by a factor of @xmath118 while the concentration parameter is @xmath119-@xmath120 , which is lower than expected from simulations , although such low values have been seen in lensing studies @xcite .",
    "extrapolating into the weak lensing regime we find that the nfw overestimates both the total mass and the shear for @xmath41 , while it underestimates them for @xmath107 .",
    "therefore , if an underlying srsic profile with @xmath0 , as is found for massive systems , is fit with an nfw using strong lensing constraints , it will overpredict both the mass ( by a factor of a few ) and the shear ( up to @xmath121 ) of the halo at large radii , and could therefore contribute to explaining why lensing mass estimates are greater than those found by x - rays .",
    "conversely , weak lensing data can in principle be used to demonstrate whether the srsic or the nfw profile is a more accurate description of the mass distribution . however , in practice a good s / n ratio is required  even for srsic profiles with",
    "low n an accuracy of better than @xmath122 is needed to distinguish the profiles and identify the shape of the mass profile accurately enough to obtain reliable parameters .",
    "most weak lensing data is not yet of sufficient accuracy to rule out an nfw profile as a good representation of the mass distribution even if the mass distribution is in fact a srsic profile with low @xmath30 .    in our analysis",
    "we have neglected the contribution of baryons  our results are therefore most applicable to massive systems , like clusters of galaxies where the dark matter dominates .",
    "even though our results clearly show that for a range of srsic parameters , in particular for halos with low @xmath30 ( corresponding to the most massive halos ) , strong lensing data can not always be well reproduced by an nfw profile , we do not address the question which of the two mass distribution is in fact a better fit to the mass distribution in clusters .",
    "however , the results from n - body simulations suggest @xcite that the srsic profile is a better fit , at least in the inner regions , which are also the regions probed by strong lensing .",
    "even if the overall mass profile of clusters is often fit well by an nfw profile , the nfw profile may not reproduce the mass distribution in the inner part adequately . as demonstrated here",
    ", the sensitivity of the strong lensing properties on the form of the mass profile in that region then means that fitting an nfw profile to the lensing data will lead to rather meaningless parameters ; the concentration parameters and masses of nfw profiles recovered in this way _ can not _ simply be compared to the values obtained in simulations . in this work",
    "we have for the first time discussed the strong lensing properties of the srsic profile , given important lensing relations , and compared it to the nfw profile .",
