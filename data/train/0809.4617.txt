    "a hallmark of the glass transition of supercooled liquids is the time dependence of physical properties  also called relaxation .",
    "this time dependence is typically seen on the timescale of the so - called maxwell relaxation time @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath3 is defined as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the low frequency limiting ( dc ) shear viscosity and @xmath6 the high frequency limiting elastic shear modulus .",
    "the relaxation is often most easily studied in the frequency domain . at high frequencies",
    "the liquid shows solid - like elastic behaviour whereas at low frequencies it shows liquid - like viscous behaviour . in general the viscoelastic stress response",
    "to oscillatoric shear strain is described by the complex dynamic shear modulus @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the structural relaxation is also observed in the specific heat .",
    "this has long ago been studied in the time domain as enthalpy relaxation @xcite , but in 1985 frequency domain studies or ac - calorimetry @xcite were introduced in the research field of supercooled liquids .",
    "common to these methods is that they excite thermal oscillations in the sample at a cyclic frequency @xmath8 . for a heat diffusivity , @xmath9",
    ", this frequency is associated with a characteristic heat diffusion length , @xmath10 the magnitude of which gives the range of the excited thermal waves .",
    "when comparing @xmath11 to a given sample size , @xmath12 , one can classify ac - calorimetry experiments as to whether the sample is thermally thin ( @xmath13 ) or thermally thick ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "a typical value of @xmath9 is @xmath15 giving @xmath16 for a frequency of @xmath17 .",
    "this means that thermally thin methods are restricted to rather low frequencies @xcite or very thin samples @xcite . in these methods",
    "the temperature field is homogeneous throughout the sample and the frequency dependent specific heat is derived directly .",
    "the ac - technique allows for easy corrections of the influence of heat leaks in a non - adiabatic configuration .",
    "ac - calorimetry on thermally thick samples on the other hand has the advantage of covering a large frequency span @xcite . in this case",
    "the temperature field is inhomogenous and what is really measured is the effusivity , @xmath18 , from which the specific heat is derived .",
    "the effusivity expresses the ability of the liquid to take up heat from parts of its surface and transport it away ( thermal effusion ) .",
    "this ability is dependent on two constitutive properties , the heat conductivity , @xmath19 , and the specific heat ( pr . volume ) , @xmath20 .",
    "the specific heat can only be found to within a proportionality constant in effusion experiments from an ( infinite ) plane .",
    "however taking boundary effects into account for finite size plane heaters @xcite one may in principle find @xmath19 and @xmath20 independently .",
    "the intermediate situation where the heat diffusion length is comparable to the sample thickness has been exploited in the so - called two - channel ac calorimeter @xcite .",
    "this fine method aims directly at an independent determination of @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the specific heat entering the effusivity is widely taken as the isobaric specific heat , @xmath21 .",
    "however recently it has been shown @xcite that in planar and spherical geometries it is rather the longitudinal specific heat , @xmath22 , that enters .",
    "when @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the adiabatic and isothermal longitudinal moduli respectively , @xmath22 is related to the isochoric specific heat , @xmath25 , by @xmath26 in contrast , when @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the adiabatic and isothermal bulk moduli respectively , @xmath21 is given by @xmath29 now @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "this means that @xmath22 will differ from @xmath21 in the relaxation regime where the shear modulus , @xmath7 , dynamically is different from zero , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 differ significantly .",
    "in this work we study the frequency dependent specific heat from thermal effusion in a spherical geometry .",
    "specific heat measurements in a spherical geometry have earlier been conducted in the thermal thin limit @xcite , but in this paper we explore the thermal thick limit .",
    "the justification is threefold 1 ) we want to realize an experimental geometry in which the thermomechanical influence on the thermal effusion can be analytically calculated @xcite .",
    "2 ) the spherical container of the liquid is a piezoelectric spherical shell by which it is possible to measure the adiabatic bulk modulus @xcite on the very same sample under identical conditions .",
    "3 ) the heat conductivity and specific heat can be found independently , as the introduction of a finite length scale allows for separation of the two .",
    "we also in this paper give an account of the @xmath2 detection technique of our variant .",
    "the experimental method used in this study is an effusion method . in such methods a harmonic varying heat current , @xmath34 , with angular frequency @xmath8 and complex amplitude @xmath35 , is produced at a surface in contact with the liquid ; this heat then `` effuses '' into the liquid . at the surface",
    "a corresponding harmonic temperature oscillation , @xmath36 , with complex amplitude @xmath37 , is created .",
    "the current and temperature can be thought of as stimuli and response ( but which is which can be interchanged at will ) , and the two are linearly related if the amplitudes , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , are small enough .",
    "hence it is convenient to introduce the complex frequency - dependent thermal impedance of the liquid @xmath40 this impedance depends on the properties of the liquid .",
    "the terminology thermal _ impedance _ derives naturally from the close analogy between the flow of thermal heat and the flow of electricity @xcite .",
    "temperature corresponds to electric potential and heat current to electrical current .",
    "the analogy also applies to the heat conductivity which corresponds to the specific electrical conductivity , and the specific heat which corresponds to electrical capacity .    as an example the thermal impedance of a thermally thin sample",
    "is given as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the volume of the sample .",
    "again an equation completely equivalent to the electrical correspondence between capacitance and impedance .    in the classical case of a planar heater in a thermal thick situation",
    "the thermal impedance is found to be @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the plate area .",
    "the lateral dimension @xmath45 has to be large ( @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "thermal effusion is possible in a spherical geometry as well as in a planar geometry .",
    "imagine a liquid confined between the to radii , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the imposed oscillating outward heat current , @xmath49 , at radius @xmath47 results in a temperature oscillation , @xmath50 , at the same radius . the heat wave propagating out into the liquid",
    "gives rise to a coupled strain wave due to thermal expansion .",
    "the heat diffusion is thus dependent on the mechanical boundary conditions and mechanical properties of the liquid .",
    "it is widely assumed that the transport of heat in a continuum is described by the heat diffusion equation @xmath51 by the same token one might take the heat diffusion constant as @xmath52 if the surfaces at @xmath47 and @xmath48 are clamped and @xmath53 if one of the surfaces is free to move .",
    "this common belief is not entirely correct .",
    "if shear modulus is nonvanishing compared to bulk modulus the description of heat diffusion can not be decoupled to a bare heat diffusion equation @xcite .",
    "such a situation arises dynamically at frequencies where @xmath54 .",
    "the fully coupled thermomechanical equations have been discussed in detail , by some of us , in planar geometry @xcite and in spherical geometry @xcite . in general",
    "the solutions are complicated but in the case of a spherical geometry where the outer radius @xmath48 is much larger than the thermal diffusion length , @xmath55 the solution becomes simple . in terms of the liquid thermal impedance , @xmath56 , at the inner radius , @xmath47",
    ", one has @xmath57 it is very interesting that in this thermally thick limit , the thermal impedance is independent of the mechanical boundary conditions @xcite . i.e.  in the two cases of clamped or free boundary conditions mentioned before it is neither the isochoric nor the isobaric specific heat that enters the diffusion constant and the thermal impedance but the longitudinal specific heat .",
    "since a closed spherical surface has no boundary there are no correction terms like the ones to eq .",
    "( [ eq : zplane ] ) discussed above for planar plate effusion .",
    "notice from eq .",
    "( [ eq : tesg2 ] ) that associated with a given radius , @xmath47 , is a characteristic heat diffusion time for the liquid @xmath58 @xmath22 and hence @xmath59 may in general be complex , but when @xmath22 is real , the imaginary part of @xmath60 peaks at @xmath61 .",
    "the @xmath62 detection technique we use ( where the subscript @xmath63 indicates that it is the electrical angular frequency not the thermal ) is different from other @xmath62 techniques ( e.g.  ref.@xcite ) in two ways .",
    "firstly , we include higher order terms in the temperature dependence of the thermistor used and in the power oscillations produced .",
    "secondly , we use a direct measurement of the time dependent voltage over a voltage divider instead of a lock - in amplifier .",
    "the @xmath62-detection technique makes it possible to measure the temperature with the same electrical resistor which generates the heat and thereby know the thermal current and the temperature at the same surface .",
    "the principle is in short the following : applying an electrical current at cyclic frequency @xmath64 through a resistor a combined constant ( zero frequency ) and @xmath65 component joule heating is produced .",
    "this gives rise to a combined temperature dc - offset and temperature oscillation at @xmath65 , the size of which depends on the thermal environment ( the thermal impedance ) .",
    "the resistor is chosen to be temperature dependent , it is a so - called _",
    "thermistor_. the temperature oscillations therefore creates a perturbation of the resistance at frequency @xmath65 .",
    "the voltage across the thermistor which by ohm s law is the product of current and resistance thus contains a @xmath62 ( and an additional @xmath66 ) component proportional to the temperature oscillations at @xmath65 . in practise one",
    "rather has a voltage source than a current source . in order to get a @xmath62 signal the thermistor",
    "is therefore placed in series with a temperature independent preresistor as detailed in the following .",
    "the result of the analysis is the frequency dependent thermal impedance at a frequency of @xmath65 .",
    "it is convenient to express this thermal impedance as function of the frequency of the thermal signal which we designate @xmath8 and notice that @xmath67 .",
    "we first outline the simplest theory in order to elucidate the technique most clearly . however , to increase the signal to noise ratio it is expedient to choose a thermistor with a large temperature dependence and to choose temperature amplitudes as high as possible although within the linear regime of the liquid thermal response .",
    "this necessitates higher harmonics be taken into account .",
    "this detailed analysis is deferred to appendix [ app : achigher ] .",
    "complex numbers are known to be of great use in harmonic analysis of linear systems .",
    "since the heat current is quadratic in the imposed electrical current and the whole idea of the @xmath62-detection technique is to exploit the inherent nonlinearity introduced by the temperature dependence of the thermistor the formalism becomes a little more troubled than in pure linear applications .",
    "thus we have to drag around the complex conjugate terms in order to get product terms right .",
    "generally a sum of harmonic terms , @xmath68 with real amplitudes , @xmath69,@xmath70 , and phases , @xmath71 , can be written as , @xmath72 by introducing the complex amplitudes @xmath73 and the shorthand notation @xmath74 the sum becomes @xmath75 where @xmath76 means that the complex conjugated of all the terms within the parenthesis should be added , including the real constant term .",
    "note that @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 .",
    "notice that any product of an @xmath80th and @xmath81th harmonic will produce both an @xmath82th and @xmath83th harmonic term .",
    "furthermore the dc - components get doubled because there is no difference between @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "consider the diagram of the electrical setup seen in fig.[fig : vdiv ] .",
    "@xmath86 is the voltage of the source and @xmath87 the voltage across the temperature independent preresistor , @xmath88 .",
