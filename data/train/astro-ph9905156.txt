    "the study of clusters of galaxies is among the most fruitful topics in cosmology .",
    "it provides rich information on large scale structures , significant for understanding the nature of formation and evolution of cosmic structures on scales of @xmath4 1 - 10 mpc .",
    "in particular , cosmological parameters such as the density parameter @xmath5 , the mass fluctuation amplitude @xmath6 and even the cosmological constant @xmath7 can be effectively constrained by observed properties of clusters .",
    "for instance , low mass density cold dark matter ( cdm ) models , @xmath8 , are found to be generally favored by the abundance and two - point correlation function of clusters ( jing & fang 1994 ; eke et al .",
    "1996 ; viana & liddle 1996 ; carlberg et al . 1997 ; bahcall , fan & cen 1997 ; croft et al . 1997 ) .    however , the redshift and peculiar velocity data on scales larger than clusters , such as iras galaxy survey , yield @xmath9 , with a trend towards @xmath10 if moderate biasing is taken into account ( e.g. dekel 1994 ; strauss & willick 1995 for summary of the results ) .",
    "moreover , structures on scales larger than typical clusters are pre - virialized , or depend on the quasilinear evolution of cosmic clustering .",
    "namely , the larger - than - cluster ( ltc ) objects are in a quantitatively different dynamical evolution stage from the objects on scales equal to or less than abell rich clusters which are virialized , or nearly virialized .",
    "thus , one can not estimate the clustering behavior of larger - than - cluster ( ltc ) objects by the results of clusters .",
    "therefore , it is worth to investigate whether the low mass density cdm cosmogony is still favored by the abundance and two - point correlation function of structures on scales larger than clusters .",
    "this is the goal of this paper .",
    "a curious thing is that we know of some observed ltc structures , like superclusters , and we know the dynamics of structure formation of popular models , but at the moment have not put them together .",
    "this is largely because the lack of a well - defined ensemble of ltcs .",
    "structures on scales larger than clusters generally are not  regular \" in both configuration and velocity spaces .",
    "there is no well - defined dynamical criterion to classify and identify these structures , and therefore , statistical approaches have not yet been carefully pursued",
    ".    this problem can be solved by a _",
    "complete _ decomposition . since",
    "a complete decomposition does not lose information , any  irregular \" objects or distributions can be precisely represented by the coefficients of a complete decomposition .",
    "thus , the model - observation confrontation can be done with a decomposed representation if the decomposition can reasonably work for both observed and model - predicted distributions .",
    "recently it has been shown that a statistical analysis can indeed be performed for un - virialized large scale structures by a complete multi - resolution analysis of the discrete wavelet transformation ( _ dwt _ ) .",
    "it has successfully identified structures on scales from 1 to about 20 @xmath2 mpc , and revealed the scaling behavior of ltc clustering ( xu , fang & wu 1998 , hereafter paper i ) .",

    "the mass of a @xmath0-cluster is measured within a sphere of radius @xmath0 .",
    "the method of finding clusters on scales @xmath0 by discrete wavelet transformation ( dwt ) has been developed in paper i ( about the technical aspects of the dwt multi - scale identification , see also fang & thews 1998 ) .",
    "we identified clusters on scales @xmath19 and @xmath20mpc from the simulated samples . a result",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "1 . it plots the top 25 massive @xmath0-clusters for each scale of @xmath21 , and 24 @xmath2 mpc , from one realization of ocdm simulation with volume 310@xmath22 mpc@xmath11 .",
    "observationally , supercluster is defined as cluster of rich clusters ( top @xmath23-clusters ) . in fig .",
    "1 , some @xmath23-clusters are located together to form large scale clumps or filaments .",
    "these structures are obviously superclusters .",
    "1 also shows , however , that some of the top 25 @xmath24 @xmath2 mpc halos contain nothing of @xmath25 24 @xmath2 mpc massive halos .",
    "this is , although the mass and length scales of these @xmath24 @xmath2 mpc clusters are the same as superclusters , they do not contain any of the top 25 clusters on smaller scales .",
    "this result indicates that the identification of superclusters by `` cluster of rich clusters '' may miss some very massive objects on scale @xmath26 24 @xmath2 mpc .",
    "recently , it has been found that the dynamical properties of superclusters are not only determined by rich clusters , but also by numerous galaxies in the intra - cluster regions ( small et al .",
    "this also implies that one should directly identify ltc structures from matter or galaxy distributions , instead of using only rich clusters .    with the multi - scale identification of simulation samples",

    "friends - of - friends _ identification ( jing & fang 1994 ) . we have also calculated mass functions of @xmath24 @xmath2 mpc clusters , which are not shown in fig . 2 , but will be employed below .",
    "the statistical errors of the mass functions of @xmath0-cluster are mainly caused by poisson errors .",
    "the middle part of the mass function is usually more reliable , as all the poisson errors are relatively small in this range . in fig .",
    "2 , this middle range corresponds roughly to @xmath31 @xmath32 mpc@xmath33 .    since each cluster",
    "now is characterized by two parameters @xmath28 and @xmath0 , it is inconvenient to define richness by mass alone . instead",
    ", the relative richness can be described by the mean neighbor separation @xmath34 between the clusters considered .",

    "multi - resolution analysis on real samples of the redshift survey of the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) galaxies with flux limit of @xmath35 ( fisher et al .",
    "the iras 1.2 jy sample contains 5313 iras galaxies , covering the whole sky with depth of about @xmath36 mpc .",
    "the sampling rate of the iras sample is low .",
    "therefore , the iras clusters identified on abell scale @xmath23 contain much fewer galaxies than optical clusters .",
    "this gives rise to higher poisson errors .",
    "however , larger @xmath0 clusters contain more members , and poisson error is lower",
    ". the iras sample can give statistically significant ensemble of @xmath37 clusters .",
    "moreover , the iras sample consists of less early type of galaxies , and more late type .",
    "namely , it has less galaxies in the center of @xmath23-clusters , but more field galaxies .",
    "this is rather a good point for studying structures beyond clusters , as late type galaxies probably are more fair tracers of mass field on larger scales .    to minimize the radial effects",

    "we then identify @xmath0-clusters in each interval .",
    "the details of cluster - finding algorithm has been discussed in paper i.    it has been shown that iras galaxies basically trace the local large scale structures .",
    "some individual clusters and superclusters from optical surveys have also been identified from the iras data ( fisher et al .",
    "1995 ; webster et al .",
    "we checked this point further by cross - identification between the abell clusters and the multi - scale identified @xmath0 clusters of the iras galaxies . using the position data ( @xmath43 , @xmath44,and @xmath45 ) collected in the compilation of the abell catalog ( abell , corwin & olowin 1989 )",
    ", one can find 18 rich clusters ( with galaxy counts @xmath46 ) in the range [ 5000 , 7500 ] km s@xmath42 .",

    "we choose the matching radius @xmath47 between the projections of centers of the cross - identified clusters to be less than 3 @xmath2 mpc , and the radial separation @xmath34 of the centers less than 2000 km s@xmath42 . in this case , 7 out of the 18 abell clusters are cross - identified with iras @xmath48mpc clusters .",
    "these are a347 , a426 , a539 , a1367 , a3389 , a3656 , a3706 .",
    "the overall confidence level of this cross - identification can be estimated by a binomial distribution function @xmath49 that a random distribution would generate @xmath50 cross - identifications from @xmath51 realizations when the chance alignment probability is known as @xmath52 . when overlapping is not important , @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the total number of clusters and the volume of the redshift shell , respectively .",
    "for the above - mentioned abell - iras cluster cross - identification the overall confidence level is 3@xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "the difference between 7 and 18 is due partially to the low sampling rate of the iras , i.e. the higher poisson errors .",
    "it is not a surprise that the richness of individual clusters estimated from iras may have large difference from optical estimate .",
    "this cross - identification seems to show that the abell clusters may be underestimated by the iras identification by a factor about 2.6 .",
    "however , we also did the cross - identification in the opposite direction , i.e. to identify the 16 top iras clusters in the shell [ 5000 , 7500 ] km s@xmath42 with abell clusters .",
    "the result is : 5 out of the 16 iras clusters have their abell counterparts .",
    "namely , the iras clusters may be underestimated by the abell clusters by a factor about 3 .",
    "therefore , satistically , both abell and iras clusters trace the same density field .",
    "if we adjust the matching radius @xmath47 and separation @xmath34 , we would find that the number of abell - iras cross - identified clusters increases from the 7 of 18 ( 3@xmath56 confidence level ) , to 13 ( 2@xmath56 ) and 15 ( 1@xmath56 ) .",
    "this shows that the abell and iras clusters provide about the same description of the massive halos on scale @xmath23 .    using the 7 better cross - identified @xmath48mpc iras - abell clusters",
    ", one can calculate the mean ratio of @xmath58 , where @xmath59 , @xmath60 is the number of galaxies of the considered abell cluster , @xmath61 is the observed number of iras galaxies within radius 1.5 @xmath2 mpc around the cluster center , and @xmath62 the iras selection function ( fisher et al .",
    "we found that the median value @xmath63 . on the other hand ,",
    "the mass - to - number ratio of abell clusters on average is @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the mass of the abell clusters ( bahcall and cen 1993 ) .",
    "thus , the total mass of the iras clusters @xmath28 can be represented as @xmath66 where the number - mass conversion coefficient @xmath67 is @xmath68      considering the luminosity is proportional to the number of galaxies , the number - mass conversion relation eq.(1 ) essentially is the mass - to - light ratio for iras @xmath23-clusters .",
    "moreover , the mass - to - light ratio for abell clusters is independent of the total mass of the clusters ( bahcall & cen 1993 ) .",
    "therefore , it seems to be reasonable to employ eq.(1 ) to find the total mass of iras @xmath23-clusters .",
    "the total number of member galaxies , @xmath69 , is given by @xmath70 , where @xmath62 is the selection function ( fisher et al .",
    "thus , we have @xmath71 using eq.(3 ) , the mass function of the iras @xmath23-clusters can be found from their abundance @xmath72 by @xmath73    using the @xmath74 given by the iras galaxies in the shell [ 5000 , 7500 ] km s@xmath42 , we calculated the mass function of the iras @xmath23-clusters @xmath75 .",
    "we found that @xmath75 is in very good agreement with the mass function of optical and x - ray clusters within abell radius , @xmath76 ( bahcall and cen 1992 ) , espicially for rich clusters of @xmath77 @xmath2 @xmath78 .",
    "we have also calculated the mass function @xmath75 using the iras data of the shells [ 2500 , 5000 ] , [ 7500 , 10000 ] and [ 10000 , 12500 ] km s@xmath42 .",
    "the resulted @xmath75 is also basically in agreement with @xmath76 .",
    "the goodness of this agreement can be desrcibed by the number - mass conversion coefficient @xmath67 . in order to have a best fitting of @xmath75 with @xmath76 , we find @xmath79 for shell [ 2500 , 5000 ] km s@xmath42 , @xmath80 for [ 5000 , 7500 ] , @xmath81 for [ 7500 , 10000 ] , @xmath82 for [ 10000 , 12500 ] . here",
    "the errors include both the poisson errors of @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "@xmath67 shows a slight decrease from lower velocity shell to higher velocity .",
    "this might be caused either by the uncertainty of the selection function , or by a very weak redshift variation of iras galaxies with respect to optical clusters .",
    "the conversion coefficients @xmath67 from all the redshift shells are the same as the @xmath67 of eq.(2 ) within errors , and their differences are not larger than a factor of 3 .",
    "this is , in terms of mass function of @xmath23-clusters , the matter distributions traced by the iras galaxies is about the same as optical and x - ray clusters on large scales .",
    "this result seems to be a little surprising .",
    "it is known that the luminous iras galaxies with heavy dust lane do not appear at the densest regions , namely the clustering of infrared galaxies is weaker than that of optical galaxies at the core region of rich clusters .",
    "therefore , the matter distributions represented by iras galaxies should be less clustering than that traced by optical galaxies on small scales .",
    "in other words , the mass - to - light ratio should actually be higher for iras clusters at the core region .",
    "however , the mass function given by eq.(4 ) matches well with that of the optical clusters .",
    "this is because the mass function eq.(4 ) measures statistically the mean number of collapsed massive @xmath23-halos over a large volume .",
    "it is actually a measure of clustering features on scales equal to or larger than clusters .",
    "it thus less depends on the physical process within the core region . in a word",
    ", the iras galaxies may cause underestimates of individual masses of some richest clusters on smaller scales , while for large scales , iras galaxies give about the same statistically features of mass field as optical objects .",
    "similar to eq.(4 ) , one may derive the mass function of iras @xmath0-clusters , @xmath85 , from their number - count function @xmath86 by @xmath87 the problem is yet how to determine @xmath67 at scale @xmath88 .    from eq.(1 ) , @xmath67 essentially is the mass - to - light ratio of the system on scale @xmath23 .",
    "the derived value of @xmath67 for @xmath23-clusters corresponds to a median mass - to - light ratio of @xmath89 . as mentioned above , @xmath23-clusters are dominated by elliptical galaxies , while the larger structures have higher fraction of spiral galaxies .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio or @xmath67 on scales @xmath88 may be smaller than @xmath23 .",
    "the observed virgo cluster infall motion , however , indicates that @xmath90 ratio does nt show a decrease with scale , while appears to flatten and remain approximately constant on scales larger than 0.2 @xmath2 mpc ( bahcall , lubin & dorman 1995 ) .",
    "this result is strengthened by a direct measure of @xmath90 of the corona borealis supercluster ( small et al .",
    "it gives @xmath91 .",
    "namely , the @xmath90 ratio on scale @xmath4 20 @xmath2 mpc is not lower , but even higher than that of rich clusters by a factor about 1.9 .",
    "this implies that the @xmath90 ratio is weakly scale - dependent from scales of 1 to about 20 @xmath2 mpc .",
    "the weak dependence of @xmath90 on scale is also supported by the following fact : the segregation between elliptical and spiral galaxies of apm bright galaxies catalogue ( bgc ) , as well as the ratio between the second order bias factors of these apm - bgc elliptical and spiral galaxies , is found to be basically scale - independent from 1 to 20 @xmath2 mpc ( loveday et al .",
    "1995 , fang , deng & xia , 1998 )",
    ". it would be reasonable to assume that the elliptical - spiral mix does nt cause a serious scale - dependence of the mass - to - light ratio on large scales , and @xmath67 is scale - independent within a factor of 3 .    using the @xmath67 for each shell (  2.3 ) , we calculated the mass functions of iras clusters with @xmath92 and @xmath20 mpc for data of the velocity shells [ 2500 , 5000 ] , [ 5000 , 7500 ] , [ 7500 , 10000 ] and [ 10000 , 12500 ] km s@xmath42 .",
    "the errors of the iras cluster mass functions are estimated by the same way as that of optical clusters .",
    "the vertical error bars in figs .",
    "3 - 6 are the poisson errors of counting the clusters in the limited volume of a shell .",
    "the horizontal error bars are the poisson errors of mass estimation of each clusters .",
    "this poisson error is generally smaller for larger @xmath0 , as more galaxies are contained in larger @xmath0 clusters .",
    "therefore , at larger @xmath0 the iras data can set effective constraints .    since the ratio between mass functions at @xmath0 and @xmath23 is independent of the value @xmath67 , figs .",
    "3 - 6 essentially are tests of the @xmath0-dependence of mass functions of @xmath0 clusters . despite the errors of these figures are large , figs .",
    "3 and 4 have shown that all @xmath27 in the range of @xmath93 @xmath2 mpc and in the two shells [ 2500 , 5000 ] and [ 5000 , 7500 ] km s@xmath42 are in good agreement with the predictions of the models of lcdm and ocdm .",
    "the results of 24 h@xmath42 mpc in these two shells ( which have not directly been shown in figs 3 and 4 ) are also basically consistent with lcdm and ocdm .",

    "yet , the iras mass functions on scales of @xmath96 and 24 @xmath2 mpc are lower than the predictions of lcdm and ocdm .",
    "the deficit of iras @xmath97 @xmath2 mpc clusters may result from the poorness of the current data at @xmath98 km s@xmath42 .",
    "since the overdensity of the large scale objects is relatively low , their detection will be poorer than small scales .",
    "moreover , not all predicted @xmath99 24 @xmath2 mpc clusters contain top rich @xmath23-clusters ( fig.1 ) , and therefore , some of these structures will be overlooked if the completeness of samples is not high enough .    figs .",
    "3 - 6 clearly show a systematic and significant lower of the iras mass functions in all velocity shells than the predictions of scdm .",
    "scdm gives too many massive clusters on @xmath100 scales of @xmath101 @xmath2 mpc .",
    "it is interesting to note that if all iras mass functions are shifted along the @xmath102 axis by a factor of about @xmath103 , the scdm model will be able to survive .",
    "the shifting factor 0.60 requires @xmath67 to be larger than our derived value by a factor @xmath104 , and the corresponding ratio @xmath90 should be as high as @xmath105 .",
    "thus , the scdm can not be saved if the uncertainty of @xmath67 is less than a factor of 4 .",
    "it has been known for a long time that the two - point cluster correlation function @xmath106 follows the same power law as galaxies , i.e. @xmath107 and @xmath108 , but has much larger correlation length @xmath109 than galaxies . moreover ,",
    "the correlation length @xmath109 defined by @xmath110 is found to be systematically increasing with the cluster richness .",
    "an empirically `` universal '' scaling @xmath111 , @xmath34 being the mean neighbor separation as employed to describe the cluster richness (  2.1 ) , was proposed to fit with the correlations of galaxies , qsos , group of galaxies , x - ray and abell clusters and even superclusters ( e.g. bahcall & soneira 1983 ; bahcall & west 1992 and references therein ) .",
    "because the sizes of these objects , from galaxies to superclusters , are systematically increasing by at least two orders , it is unclear whether various objects with very different scales can really be fitted with one `` universal '' scaling .",
    "this problem can be solved by studying the two - point correlations of clusters with different @xmath0 . using samples of @xmath0-clusters from n - body simulation",
    ", we found that the two - point correlation functions of @xmath0-clusters can be well fitted with a power law @xmath112 for all considered @xmath0 and @xmath34 .",

    "this is , in the range of @xmath25 3 @xmath2 mpc , the @xmath109-@xmath34 relation is `` universal '' , independent of the size of structures .",
    "the model scdm and lcdm show similar `` universal '' @xmath109-@xmath34 relations .",

    "this is a common feature for all the three models .",
    "theoretically , the decrease of @xmath109 with @xmath0 is expected .",
    "1 shows that most halos of @xmath124 , 1.5 or 3 @xmath2 mpc coincide to form a 0.75 - 1.5 - 3 clouds - in - clouds .",
    "this is because most halos of @xmath125 @xmath2 mpc are virialized .",
    "therefore , the detection of @xmath0-clusters with @xmath126 @xmath2 mpc will find almost the same objects .",
    "in other words , the ensembles of @xmath124 , 1.5 or 3 @xmath2 mpc clusters actually consist of the same objects , and therefore , they have the same correlations , and the universal @xmath122-@xmath34 relations . however , on scales larger than 4 @xmath2 mpc , more and more halos are less developed , and their correlations are lower .",
    "therefore , the `` universal '' increase of the correlation amplitudes with scale from galaxies , groups to clusters should be broken down for @xmath3 3 - 4 @xmath2 mpc clusters .",

    "for @xmath128 , the values of @xmath109 found from the iras samples are in agreement with those from apm sample ( bahcall & cen 1992 ; croft et al .",
    "9 shows , obviously , that the @xmath109-@xmath34 relation from iras samples of @xmath129 1.5 to 12 @xmath2 mpc favors the models of ocdm and lcdm .",
    "the scdm - predicted @xmath109-@xmath34 curves are systematically lower than the iras results for all considered @xmath34 .",
    "we also tested the models by the @xmath0-dependence of @xmath109 .",
    "fig.10 gives the @xmath109-@xmath0 relations from the simulation samples and iras data .",
    "the errors of the iras data are also large .",
    "but the observed data show once again that the lcdm and ocdm are basically consistent with the iras data , while the scdm - predicted @xmath109 is too low to match with the observation .",
    "more importantly , it is clear to see the slow decrease of @xmath122 with the increase of @xmath0 in all models .",

    "structures on scales equal to and larger than typical clusters have been identified by the _ dwt _ decomposition .",
    "this method is shown to be able to systematically and uniformly identify structures on various scales , especially those of larger than the size of typical clusters . taking this advantage",
    ", one can produce statistically available ensembles of @xmath0-clusters from simulation samples and observational data .",
    "to describe the dynamics of the cosmic clustering on scales beyond clusters , we introduced several new statistical measures : the bivariant abundance function @xmath27 , the @xmath0-dependence of abundance , the @xmath0-dependence of correlations , etc .",
    "these statistics are useful to reveal the features of pre - virialized regime of cosmic gravitational clustering , and to discriminate among models of structure formation , especially on large scales .",
    "the identification of ltcs is effective to extract information from sparsely distributed data like the iras galaxies .",
    "the iras 1.2 jy galaxies have low sampling rate compared to optical galaxies and are not found at cluster centers .",
    "they are not very effective to be employed for identification of traditional @xmath23-clusters",
    ". however , the iras clusters with @xmath130 @xmath2 mpc can already set effective constraints on models , if the mass - to - light ratio for structures traced by iras galaxies is assumed to asymptotically reach a constant on scales larger than abell radius .",
    "therefore , iras galaxies can provide the same information of large scale structures as optical and x - ray galaxies , if the considered scales are larger than the scale of morphological segregation of iras galaxies that no dusty spirals like iras sources exist at the immediate neigbhourhood of densest regions .",
    "the multi - resolution analysis of the iras sample concludes that the abundances @xmath27 and correlations of objects on scales @xmath129 1 to 24 @xmath2 mpc can be described by lcdm and ocdm , while the scdm is in difficulty .",
    "namely , the abundances and two - point correlation functions of structures on scales as large as about 20 @xmath2 mpc favor a low - density universe if @xmath90 ratio is assumed to be flat over these scales .",
