    "<S> we propose a two - way secure - communication protocol in which alice uses an amplified spontaneous emission source while bob employs binary phase - shift keying and an optical amplifier . against an eavesdropper who captures all the light lost in fibers linking alice and bob , </S>",
    "<S> this protocol is capable of 3.5gbps quantum - secured direct communication at 50 km range . </S>",
    "<S> if alice augments her terminal with a spontaneous parametric downconverter and both alice and bob add channel monitors , they can realize 2gbps quantum key distribution at that range against an eavesdropper who injects her own light into bob s terminal . </S>",
    "<S> compared with prevailing quantum key distribution methods , this protocol has the potential to significantly increase secure key rates at long distances by employing many ultrabroadband photons per key bit to mitigate channel loss .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum key distribution ( qkd ) allows a random bit - string to be shared between remote parties with security vouchsafed by the laws of quantum mechanics @xcite . were its secret - key rate equal to the desired communication rate </S>",
    "<S> , qkd would enable full information - theoretic security by means of one - time pad encryption . unfortunately , demonstrated secret - key rates fall far short of what is needed for widespread use of one - time pad encryption . </S>",
    "<S> at present , therefore , qkd s principal application is to rekey classical cryptosystems , making overall security that of the classical system . in this </S>",
    "<S> regard , quantum - secured direct communication ( qsdc ) @xcite may be preferable to key distribution , especially if it can be done at high rates . </S>",
    "<S> quantum illumination ( qi ) @xcite is an entanglement - based two - way protocol that has the potential to accomplish that goal , but in its present form has two major drawbacks , which will be described below . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we report a new protocol , based on qi , that eliminates these drawbacks and offers unprecedented rate - versus - distance capability . </S>",
    "<S> the new protocol realizes passive eavesdropping immunity  i.e . , </S>",
    "<S> immunity to an eve who merely listens to light leaking out of the connections between alice and bob  without the use of entanglement . that immunity is shown to arise from the no - cloning theorem , as is the case for the security of both discrete - variable and continuous - variable qkd . </S>",
    "<S> entanglement does come into play , however , in making the new protocol resistant to active eavesdropping , i.e. , when eve injects her own light into bob . </S>",
    "<S> we begin our development with a description of the qi protocol as it provides the foundation for what will follow .    in qi </S>",
    "<S> , alice creates entangled signal and idler beams and transmits the signal to bob while retaining the idler . </S>",
    "<S> bob modulates the light he receives from alice using binary phase - shift keying ( bpsk ) , amplifies the modulated light to boost the signal strength and mask his message with amplified spontaneous emission ( ase ) noise , and returns the resulting light to alice . owing to the initial entanglement </S>",
    "<S> , alice can recover bob s message while a passive eavesdropper can not . </S>",
    "<S> the first drawback of qi is its vulnerabilty to active eavesdropping , which is a major concern for qi carried out over optical fibers . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we will postpone discussing how active eavesdropping might be defeated until we address qi s other drawback , which limits its rate - versus - distance capability even when eve only employs passive eavesdropping .    </S>",
    "<S> suppose that the protocol from @xcite is used on a fiber channel , as shown in fig .  1 . here </S>",
    "<S> : ( 1 ) alice employs a continuous - wave ( cw ) spontaneous parametric downconverter ( spdc ) source , with phase - matching bandwidth @xmath0 and brightness ( average photon number / s - hz ) @xmath1 , transmits the signal beam to bob over a fiber link of transmissivity @xmath2 , and stores her idler beam in a fiber loop of transmissivity @xmath3 ; ( 2 ) bob uses @xmath4bps bpsk to encode his message and an erbium - doped fiber amplifier ( edfa )        of gain @xmath5 and ase output noise of brightness @xmath6 to mask his message ; and ( 3 ) alice recovers bob s message with the best known receiver for that task , viz . , the optical parametric amplifier ( opa ) receiver @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the opa receiver requires alice to store her idler for a time equal to the roundtrip propagation delay between alice and bob , making @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the error probability of alice s receiver then satisfies @xmath8 , assuming ideal equipment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , eve s passive - eavesdropping error probability for her ( realization unknown ) optimum quantum receiver obeys @xmath9 @xcite , assuming that she collects all the light lost en route between alice and bob . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath10 versus @xmath11 disparity between alice and eve s error exponents provides alice and bob with direct - communication security against this passive - eavesdropping individual attack when the former substantially exceeds the latter @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> alice s @xmath12 versus @xmath13 advantage derives from the maximally - entangled nature of the phase - sensitive cross correlation between the signal and idler emitted by her spdc source , while her @xmath14 versus @xmath15 disadvantage is due to her needing an idler - storage fiber that is twice as long as the alice - to - bob fiber .    </S>",
    "<S> an alternative qi architecture that avoids this idler - loss scaling was introduced in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it replaces bob s single - channel bpsk modulator with @xmath16 independent dense wavelength - division multiplexed ( dwdm ) bpsk modulators that encode rate @xmath17bps data on nonoverlapping @xmath18hz slices of the signal spectrum , and it replaces alice s opa receiver with @xmath16 dwdm homodyne receivers for the matching spectral bands of her idler and the light returned to her from bob . because homodyne detection of the idler can be done immediately , with delay - locking performed post - detection , alice s error probability for each dwdm channel is given by @xmath19 with ideal equipment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the implementation burden for this architecture is overwhelming : 50 dwdm channels with @xmath20ghz bandwidth would be needed to fully populate a @xmath21thz phase - matching bandwidth , and each of those channels would need a high - speed analog - to - digital converter to retain the information required to realize the error probability given above . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the dwdm architecture is _ not  a satisfactory solution to the idler - storage problem . in its stead </S>",
    "<S> we propose replacing alice s spdc source with an ase source ( e.g. , an edfa ) , and her opa receiver with a broadband ( single - channel ) balanced - homodyne receiver . </S>",
    "<S> the ase source s high brightness permits a low - brightness portion of its output to be sent to bob ; such light can perfectly mimic what bob ( and a passively eavesdropping eve ) would see were alice to have used an spdc source . however , because alice now retains high - brightness ase light that is perfectly correlated with what she is sending to bob , fiber - spool storage for the roundtrip delay is no longer problematic , i.e. , she can use optical amplifiers in her storage system with insignificant error - exponent ( signal - to - noise ratio ) penalty @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , this bright stored light is exactly what is needed as the local oscillator ( lo ) for broadband homodyne reception of the light returned by bob . </S>",
    "<S> now , alice s error probability , with ideal equipment , is given by @xmath22 @xcite , while the passive - eavesdropping eve s optimum quantum receiver s performance is still @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> comparing the asymptotic expressions for @xmath23 and @xmath24 reveals that the latter loses a factor of two in its error exponent compared to the former , but gains a much larger benefit by virtue of its immunity to the idler - storage loss that plagues the spdc - based system . </S>",
    "<S> another benefit afforded by alice s switching to an ase source is that she can optimize her secure rate by choosing the brightness of the signal light she sends to bob over a much wider range than is available from an spdc source . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the bulk - optics cw spdc sources that produce maximally - entangled signal and idler outputs are generally limited to @xmath25 , but commercial edfas can yield output brightness as high as @xmath26 , from which any desired @xmath27 signal brightness is easily obtained . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that the upper bound from @xcite on eve s passive - eavesdropping holevo information as a function of alice s @xmath12 also applies , unchanged , when alice uses an ase source . _    figure  2(a ) compares qi s secure - rate - versus - distance performance when alice uses the ase - source / homodyne - receiver setup proposed herein , in lieu of the spdc - source / opa - receiver configuration from @xcite , and a passive - eavesdropping eve mounts an optimum collective attack </S>",
    "<S> . the curves therein are secure - rate lower bounds for the spdc and ase systems obtained from @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is alice and bob s shannon information rate , @xmath30 is an upper bound on eve s holevo information rate , and @xmath31 is the efficiency of the error - correcting code employed by alice and bob @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> both curves assume that : ( 1 ) alice and bob are connected by fibers with 0.2db / km loss ; ( 2 ) alice s source has 2thz bandwidth ; ( 3 ) the brightness @xmath12 of the signal light alice sends to bob and the bit rate @xmath32gbps of bob s bspk modulator are chosen to maximize @xmath33 ; ( 4 ) bob s amplifier has gain @xmath34 and output ase with brightness @xmath35 ; and ( 5 ) eve collects all light lost en route between alice and bob . </S>",
    "<S> for the spdc / opa system , alice stores her idler in fiber with 0.2db / km loss , and she chooses her opa s gain @xmath36in conjunction with her @xmath12 and bob s @xmath37to maximize @xmath33 . her receiver s photodetector quantum efficiency is 0.9 , its bandwidth is sufficient to accommodate 10ghz bpsk , and @xmath38 is assumed . for the ase / homodyne system , alice s reference  i.e . </S>",
    "<S> , her @xmath39 brightness lo  is presumed to be stored without degradation , her homodyne receiver s efficiency is 0.9 @xcite , and its bandwidth is sufficient for 10ghz bpsk . in addition , her error probability is constrained to satisfy @xmath40 , making her @xmath41 achievable at @xmath42 with a rate-1/2 low - density parity - check code @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all other aspects of both systems are ideal .    </S>",
    "<S> , at which these secure rates are realized . </S>",
    "<S> see text for additional details.,title=\"fig:\",width=153 ] , at which these secure rates are realized . </S>",
    "<S> see text for additional details.,title=\"fig:\",width=153 ]    there are several points worthy of note regarding the results shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the first is a reminder that alice and bob s passive - eavesdropping immunity applies to qsdc , in addition to qkd . </S>",
    "<S> the second is that obviating alice s storage loss by use of ase light provides an enormous increase in secure - rate - versus - distance performance . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the ase / homodyne system is capable of a 3.5gbps secure rate over 50 km of low - loss fiber , whereas the spdc / opa system s secure rate is about @xmath43-times lower at that distance . a third , more fundamental , point concerns the physical basis for this passive eavesdropping immunity . </S>",
    "<S> prior work ascribed qi s passive - eavesdropping immunity to the entanglement between the signal and idler beams produced by alice s spdc source @xcite , making its experimental demonstration the first realized example of entanglement s benefit surviving an entanglement - breaking channel . </S>",
    "<S> alice s switching to an ase source to provide both her low - brightness signal and high - brightness local oscillator implies that entanglement is _ not  necessary to realize immunity to passive eavesdropping . with the ase source , </S>",
    "<S> security now rests on the no - cloning theorem , i.e. , eve is unable to obtain a high - brightness version of the signal light alice sends to bob with which to make her own high - quality homodyne measurement of bob s message . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we point out that , over the path lengths shown , the optimum @xmath44gbps value _ without  the @xmath45 constraint is 10gbps . </S>",
    "<S> thus the abrupt slope change in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) s ase / homodyne curve occurs when @xmath37 must be reduced to satisfy that constraint . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that alice and bob s secure - rate / distance region can be increased if both the modulation rate and error - probability constraints are relaxed , as could be done with advances in modulator technology and further development of high - efficiency error - correcting codes . _ _    </S>",
    "<S> now let us return to the issue of defeating an active attack . </S>",
    "<S> our proposal for defeating such attacks is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 . </S>",
    "<S> alice passively combines signal light from a bandwidth @xmath0 , brightness @xmath46 spdc source with light from highly - attenuated , bandwidth @xmath0 ase source in a 1:99 ratio , resulting in a bandwidth @xmath0 , brightness @xmath12 signal beam that she sends to bob . </S>",
    "<S> alice uses a single - photon counter to detect photons from her spdc source s idler beam , and retains her bright ase light for use as a broadband homodyne lo . because alice and bob will be monitoring the power levels and power spectra at their respective terminals , eve minimizes her exposure and maximizes her holevo information by : ( 1 ) replacing the 0.2db / km fibers connecting alice and bob with her own lossless fibers ; ( 2 ) injecting signal light from an spdc source identical to alice s into the alice - to - bob channel through a beam splitter , while preserving the power level and spectrum seen by bob ; and ( 3 ) withdrawing some light from the bob - to - alice channel through another beam splitter , while preserving the power level and spectrum seen by alice . </S>",
    "<S> alice and bob s security rests on : ( 1 ) their measuring the singles rates for alice s detection of spdc idler photons and bob s detection of photons he has tapped from the light he received from alice ; and ( 2 ) their monitoring the coincidence rate for these measurements . </S>",
    "<S> that coincidence rate is degraded , relative to the singles rates , by eve s light injection . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , alice and bob s singles ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) and coincidence ( @xmath49 ) rates obey @xcite @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 . here : @xmath53 is the detection efficiency of alice and bob s monitors ; @xmath54 is the fraction of alice s spdc signal light that is coupled into the fiber going to bob ; @xmath55 is the transmissivity of the @xmath56-km - long fibers connecting alice and bob ; @xmath57 is the fraction of the light bob receives that he routes to his monitor ; @xmath58ps is the gate time of alice and bob s monitors ; and @xmath59 is the fraction of the light received by bob that came from alice .    figure  4(a ) shows a lower bound on alice and bob s secure rate , @xmath28 , in the presence of the active - eavesdropping eve @xcite when their monitoring ensures that @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> also included is a brightness plot for the light alice sends to bob . </S>",
    "<S> these curves were obtained assuming that : ( 1 ) the brightness of the signal alice sends to bob and bob s bit rate @xmath61gbps are chosen to maximize their secure rate subject to the constraint that @xmath45 so that @xmath41 can be assumed ; ( 2 ) alice s homodyne receiver has an undegraded local oscillator with brightness @xmath39 and efficiency 0.9 ; and ( 3 ) all other system aspects are ideal . </S>",
    "<S> we see that 2gbps qkd is possible at 50 km range .        , </S>",
    "<S> at which this bound is realized . </S>",
    "<S> see text for additional details . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) secure rate in bits per mode versus one - way path loss : comparison between the takeoka - guha - wilde ( tgw ) bound , ideal continuous - variable ( cv ) qkd , and the ase / homodyne protocol from fig .  3 </S>",
    "<S> whose performance ( in bits / sec ) is shown in ( a).,title=\"fig:\",width=168 ] , at which this bound is realized . </S>",
    "<S> see text for additional details . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) secure rate in bits per mode versus one - way path loss : comparison between the takeoka - guha - wilde ( tgw ) bound , ideal continuous - variable ( cv ) qkd , and the ase / homodyne protocol from fig .  3 </S>",
    "<S> whose performance ( in bits / sec ) is shown in ( a).,title=\"fig:\",width=145 ]    at this juncture , there are two points worth discussing . first , there is a major distinction to be drawn between the active and passive cases . </S>",
    "<S> it will take a time @xmath62 for alice and bob to verify , from their measured singles and coincidence rates , that eve s intrusion does not violate @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> thus qsdc operation is not possible unless bob stores his modulated and amplified light for a @xmath62-duration interval prior to sending it to alice , because he must ensure that the channel is safe to use for qsdc before he transmits his message . at a 50 km alice - to - bob path length , </S>",
    "<S> we have found @xmath64s @xcite , making bob s optical storage out of the question with current technology . absent a breakthrough in wideband , long - lived quantum memory , our approach to defeating active eavesdropping </S>",
    "<S> therefore restricts alice and bob to using their system for qkd @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> that said , their secure rate at 50 km is orders of magnitude beyond what is possible with other qkd protocols , making it fast enough to support one - time pad file encryption . </S>",
    "<S> the second point of note concerns the degree to which the active attack we have considered is the most powerful one that eve could mount . </S>",
    "<S> we can show that eve s use of an spdc source is her best beam - splitter active attack for a 3-mode @xmath65 when @xmath1 in that it nearly saturates the bound set by the entanglement - assisted holevo capacity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the same is true , _ without  the @xmath66 restriction , for a two - mode active attack in which eve ignores the light tapped from the alice - to - bob channel @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> _    finally , it behooves to consider how close our protocol might come to an ultimate limit . </S>",
    "<S> takeoka _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . @xcite </S>",
    "<S> have shown that a two - way protocol for either qsdc or qkd that is carried out over a channel whose one - way transmissivity is @xmath15 has its bits / mode secure rate bounded above by @xmath67 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> it is not known , however , whether this bound is attainable . </S>",
    "<S> the highest known achievable bits / mode secure rate is the @xmath68 rate of ideal continuous - variable qkd @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure  4(b ) compares these rates with the bits / mode behavior of our ase / homodyne system , whose bits / mode equals its bits / s divided by @xmath0 , because operation is through single - mode fiber . </S>",
    "<S> we see that there is a substantial gap between our protocol s bits / mode performance and the ultimate limit . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , our protocol s bits / s performance is orders of magnitude better than any existing qkd protocol because its modes / s value is set by the phase - matching bandwidth @xmath69thz , whereas both continuous - variable and discrete - variable qkd protocols have modes / s values set by electrical bandwidths that are @xmath70ghz , unless wavelength - division multiplexing ( wdm ) is employed . </S>",
    "<S> wdm can also be applied advantageously to our protocol , however , enabling it to maximize its overall secure rate  beyond what we have found for single - channel system  by operating each wavelength channel at the limit of bpsk - modulator and edfa technology with the @xmath71 value needed for high - efficiency error correction . _    in conclusion , we have shown how a new two - way protocol for secure communication can overcome the qi protocol s problem of idler - storage loss limiting its rate - versus - distance capability against a passive eavesdropper , _ and  how our protocol s addition of coincidence - based channel monitoring can defeat active eavesdropping . in doing </S>",
    "<S> so we found that entanglement is _ not  essential to passive eavesdropping immunity : eve s inability to clone a low - brightness thermal - state signal beam suffices . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , our new protocol affords unprecedented rate - versus - distance qsdc capability against a passive eavesdropper and a similar qkd capability against an active eavesdropper . in both cases the parameter values </S>",
