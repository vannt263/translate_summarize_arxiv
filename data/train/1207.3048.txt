    "for many decades since its discovery , entangled quantum states were only important in discussions on the foundations and on the meaning of quantum mechanics @xcite . by the end of the twentieth century , though , the fate of entangled quantum states changed abruptly .",
    "these states are now seen and understood as a resource available in nature which , if properly processed and handled , are capable of performing in a very efficient way several protocols designed to process and transmit information @xcite .",
    "indeed , with the aid of entangled states one can , at least in principle , transmit data in a totally secure fashion @xcite , overcome ( double ) the limit of classical information that can be transmitted from one region to another by sending the same number of particles @xcite and , not least fantastic , teleport microscopic particles @xcite .    these and many other quantum informational tasks @xcite assume the existence of perfect entanglement among the many particles that constitute a given quantum system .",
    "in other words , one needs maximally entangled states for the successful implementation of several of the previous protocols .",
    "however , perfect entanglement is extremely difficult to generate and preserve in the laboratory , particularly when one deals with many particles at the same time ; maximally entangled states rapidly degrade to partially entangled ones .",
    "a possible solution to this problem is to develop entanglement distillation strategies @xcite . by entanglement distillation we mean any protocol whose ultimate goal is to obtain a maximally entangled states from a given number of partially entangled ones . in general , a distillation procedure is only useful if it operates exclusively through local operations and classical communication ( locc ) .",
    "local operations are , for example , single measurements on subsystems or local unitary transformations . for classical communication",
    "we mean that there is the possibility of exchanging classical signals between subsystems using classical communication channels .",
    "for example , the result of a measurement at a given location can be transmitted by radio waves to the sites where the other subsystems lie .",
    "however , we may ask whether there could be another way to explore partially entangled states in order to make them useful to the implementation of the aforementioned protocols . putting it another way ,",
    "is nt it possible to use them _ directly _ to perform an informational task , without relying on distillation protocols ?",
    "moreover , it might happen that we only have at our disposal one copy of a partially entangled state and do not have the resources to implement a distillation protocol .",
    "is there not a way to directly use it to accomplish our task ?",
    "for some communication protocols , the answers to the previous questions are positive if one deals with pure partially entangled states @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we further explore the direct use of partially entangled states to perform quantum communication tasks .",
    "first we review the three major strategies to harness partially entangled states for direct quantum teleportation .",
    "we then compare their efficiencies assuming either perfect or noisy devices ( non - perfect measurements and unitary evolutions ) . by doing",
    "so we give conditions under which a particular strategy is better suited than the other two .",
    "second , we present new quantum teleportation protocols which are built combining those three major techniques .",
    "this leads to an increase in the efficiency of those well known protocols @xcite .",
    "we also present a direct multiple teleportation protocol based on partially entangled states whose efficiency is exactly equal to the best known distillation protocol devised to accomplish the same task @xcite .",
    "we then develop new teleportation protocols employing multipartite partially entangled states as our quantum resource @xcite , in contrast to standard approaches that use partially entangled bell states .",
    "the three techniques are also combined here in order to achieve the highest efficiency possible .",
    "we then show that among the new protocols there exist three cases where the teleportation is successful without knowing the entanglement content of the partially entangled quantum channels , as is mandatory in refs .",
    "@xcite and in some cases of ref .",
    "finally , we show how one can compute the efficiency upper bound for direct teleportation protocols that make use of partially entangled bell states .",
    "as anticipated in the introductory paragraphs , maximally entangled states are not really essential for the implementation of many informational tasks . however , there is a price to pay .",
    "although the cost to produce and preserve maximally entangled states is high , any protocol that makes use of these states theoretically work with probability one . on the other hand , by replacing maximally entangled states with partially entangled ones , one faces , even theoretically , instances in which the protocol fails . in other words , when using maximally entangled states one deals with deterministic protocols , while using partially entangled states one necessary has probabilistic ones .",
    "quantum communication protocols , and in particular teleportation , directly using partially entangled states can be divided into at least three groups . in each group",
    "one uses a fundamentally different strategy to cope with the limitation of dealing with partially entangled states . in the first group @xcite the imperfection caused by using a non - ideal channel",
    "is corrected by interacting an auxiliary qubit with the qubit carrying the final imperfect teleported state . by correctly choosing the interaction between them , which depends on the partially entangled state being used in the protocol as well as on the measurement results of alice",
    ", one can transfer the error to the auxiliary qubit and `` clean '' the qubit carrying the teleported state .",
    "the second group includes strategies that modify the original teleportation protocol @xcite . in particular , one changes the measurements made onto the input qubits of the protocol @xcite . depending on the type of partially entangled state used , specific changes to the protocol turns it useful again .",
    "finally , we have the third group @xcite , which contains the cases where one repeats the same protocol , one or more times , using as input the output of the previous implementation . in this way one gets a correct result after a few repetitions . in this group",
    "one has the phenomenon of self - correction , where an error introduced in one step is compensated by the next error in the next step of the protocol .",
    "so far , however , little has been done in the direction to combine these three strategies to increase the success rate of teleportation protocols based on the direct use of partially entangled states . a study in which two of these techniques were combined with success as well as the introduction of another one",
    "was made in ref .",
    "one of our goals here is to combine these many strategies in order to improve the efficiency of the most well - known probabilistic teleportation protocols @xcite .    in order to be",
    "self contained and to pave the way to the presentation of our new results in the next sections , we now present in a unified formalism the three strategies just mentioned .",

    "a ) alice and bob share the entangled state @xmath0 and she performs a generalized bell measurement spanned by the states labeled by @xmath1 ; b ) alice informs bob of her measurement result .",
    "this information allows bob to properly choose what sort of unitary operation ( interaction ) @xmath2 to implement onto the recipient and ancilla qubits and also which local unitaries ( pauli matrices ) to apply onto the recipient qubit ; c ) bob measures the ancilla . depending on his result",
