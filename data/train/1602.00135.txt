    "these experimental studies show a large variability in the mechanical properties  @xcite , and to understand the intricate dynamic behaviour of suspended graphene , it is necessary to detect its motion with spatial resolution .",
    "while initial experiments were done on structures with intentionally broken radial symmetry  @xcite , the local phase of the membrane motion was not measured in these cases , which makes identification of the mode difficult , especially for the higher modes and in the presence of small imperfections . moreover",
    ", previous experiments did not measure absolute displacements , which makes the acquisition of quantitative displacement profiles of the fundamental and higher modes impossible . + here",
    ", we visualize the motion of two - dimensional nanodrums with unprecedented resolution and sensitivity using a phase - sensitive scanning interferometer .",
    "the driven motion and the non - driven brownian motion of a suspended few - layer graphene resonator vibrating at very high frequencies is detected up to the eighth vibrational mode .",
    "the phase information enables a reconstruction of the time - evolution of the displacement profile . in the radially symmetric nanodrum we observe splitting of multiple degenerate modes , as well as a distortion of the mode structure . by visualizing the brownian motion ,",
    "the displacement profiles are calibrated as to obtain spatially resolved displacement amplitudes .",
    "the spatially resolved measurements enable a detailed examination of the mode structure , and provide a useful tool in the efforts towards reproducible fabrication of suspended two - dimensional materials .",
    "circular graphene nanodrums are fabricated by transferring exfoliated few - layer graphene on top of silicon substrates pre - patterned with circular holes , as is described in the methods section and in supplementary section 1 .",
    "figure 1a shows the graphene nanodrum of interest , with a diameter of @xmath0 and a thickness of @xmath1 as confirmed by raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy ( fig .",
    "the flexural motion of the nanodrum is detected using an optical interferometer , which has been used previously in frequency- and time - domain studies of the nanomechanical properties of 2d - materials  @xcite .",
    "figure 1c shows the setup and a schematic cross - section of the graphene nanodrum .",
    "the drum is probed by a helium - neon laser , and the intensity variations caused by the interfering reflections from the moving membrane and the fixed silicon substrate underneath are detected with a photodiode , as is described in more detail in supplementary section 2 .",
    "+        the sample can be moved in - plane with the graphene ( x - y ) using a motorized nanopositioning stage .",
    "compared to a scanning mirror , moving the sample does not affect the intensity of the incident light such that the transduction gain of the setup remains constant .",
    "this makes a calibration of the displacements possible , as will be shown below . with a step size of @xmath2 , the spectral response",
    "is measured at @xmath3 points spatially distributed across the suspended part of the drum , which is sufficient to visualize the displacements associated with higher vibration modes , which exhibit an increasing number of nodal lines . +",
    "two measurement types can be selected by setting the switch @xmath4 ( see fig .",
    "when @xmath5 , the complex response ( magnitude and phase ) to an electrostatic driving signal is measured using a vector network analyser ( vna ) . when @xmath6 , the driving signal is switched off , and the brownian motion of the membrane is detected using a spectrum analyser ( sa ) .",
    "figure 1d shows the magnitude and phase response ( @xmath5 ) at the fundamental resonance mode , which corresponds well to an harmonic oscillator .",

    "the resonance frequencies calculated for a perfect circular membrane are also displayed  @xcite .",
    "the measured resonance frequencies are conspicuously different from the calculated ones , which raises the central question addressed in this work : which mode indices correspond to each of the observed resonance peaks ?      the motion of the graphene nanodrum is made visible using a phase - sensitive scanning interferometer . to demonstrate the technique , we set out by measuring the frequency response of mode 3 at five different positions on the drum , as illustrated in fig .",
    "the amplitude and phase responses are fit to a harmonic oscillator function , and the fits are shown in fig .",
    "2b .        from the responses",
    "it is observed that , while two halves of the drum move at a comparable amplitude , their phase differs by @xmath8 .",
    "this indicates that at positions 2 and 4 the graphene moves in opposite direction , as is the case for a @xmath9 mode  @xcite . following this procedure ,",
    "a more refined measurement is performed .",
    "figure 2c , d display on a color scale the fitted peak height , @xmath10 , and phase responses @xmath11 at the resonance peak frequency , measured on a square grid with a spacing of 140 nm .",
    "the amplitude response reveals two anti - nodal points which are separated by a nodal line , and the phase response shows that on either side of the nodal line the graphene moves in opposite direction .",
    "while for the @xmath9 mode this phase behaviour appears trivial , we will show below that the phase information is a requisite to understand the motion of higher modes .",
    "figure 2e shows a snapshot colormap of the membrane movement , as obtained by @xmath12 .",

    "whose thermal motion was studied recently  @xcite , graphene nanodrums have a very low reflectivity and a 10 - 100 times lower mechanical q - factor .",
    "nevertheless , the present technique is sensitive enough to visualize their brownian motion . + to study the brownian motion , the switch is set to @xmath6 , in order to switch - off the driving signal and to the record displacements with a spectrum analyser .",
    "figure 4a shows an example of a thermal noise spectrum , taken close to the centre of the drum .",
    "three vibrational modes are observed that resemble the lowest three resonances of fig .  1e , albeit at somewhat lower frequencies .",
    "the difference in frequency results from the absence of the electrostatic force : as @xmath42 , no force is exerted on the graphene drum . compared to teh driven measurement , a part of the mechanical tension",
    "is released , which causes the resonance frequencies to tune to a lower value .",
    "supplementary section 3 discusses the tuning of the resonance frequency as well as the optimization of the signal - to - noise ratio by adjusting @xmath43 . with the same step size as in the driven measurement , we map the first three mode shapes and plot the thermal rms displacement as a function of position .",
    "figure 4b shows the brownian motion of the fundamental @xmath20 mode , and 4c and 4d show a splitting of the degenerate @xmath9 mode , in close agreement with the amplitude map of the driven motion . note that in the absence of a driving signal the phase is not measured as it diffuses within the measurement integration time . +        for applications of suspended two - dimensional materials , it is important to quantify the displacements associated with the motion .",
    "the rms displacement of a nanomechanical resonator can be obtained by measuring its brownian motion  @xcite . from the power spectral density of the signal measured at the centre of the drum , @xmath44 , the noise floor @xmath45 and the transduction factor @xmath46}$ ]",
    "are calculated .",
    "the thermal displacement noise spectral density of the fundamental mode at the drum centre is given by @xmath47}$ ] , where @xmath48 is the resonance frequency , @xmath49 is the quality factor and @xmath50 its effective mass  @xcite . with an incident optical power of @xmath51 ,",
    "the noise floor equals @xmath52 , which enables the detection of the three resonance modes .",
    "the transduction factor equals @xmath53 , and using this number , all detected displacement signals in the experiments of fig .",
    "3 and fig .  4",
    "are converted to absolute displacements , and indicated in the respective colour bars .",
    "from the summary of the measurement results presented in table 1 , it becomes clear that the ratios of the higher harmonics to the fundamental mode , @xmath54 , deviate from the theoretically expected frequencies for a membrane resonator  @xcite .",
    "deviations range from 0.7 % for mode @xmath55 to 8.6 % for mode @xmath56 . while the spatial maps show that the difference between the measured and theoretical mode shapes increases with the mode index , there is no obvious correlation between the differences in the resonance frequencies and the distortion of the mode shapes . for example , the mode shape of @xmath57 is in good agreement , while the mode shape of @xmath55 bears almost no resemblance to the theoretical calculation . interestingly , comparing them in the frequency domain , @xmath55 differs by only 0.7 % , and @xmath57 by 3.3 % from its theoretical value .",
    "the same holds for the radially symmetric mode @xmath34 , whose frequency is within 2 % of the calculation , while its mode shape is highly distorted .",
    "thus , the lower modes appear more robust against imperfections , possibly due to the lower number of nodal lines  a tendency that is confirmed by finite - element simulations provided in supplementary section 4 .",
    "these findings are of particular interest in the light of the recently proposed nanomechanical schemes to detect the _ geometry _ of adsorbed masses  @xcite , which rely on an accurate description of the mode shapes . in such schemes , the splitting of the degenerate modes , which is also observed in the brownian motion and emerges from the structural imperfections in our experiments ,",
    "could be used to provide information about the geometry of the adsorbed mass . + it is interesting to further investigate the origins of the mode - splitting and the progressive distortion of the mode structure for the higher modes . to this end , we map the local stiffness of the drum using peak - force afm ( measurement details provided in supplementary section 4 ) .",
    "the analysis reveals local inhomogeneities in the membrane that went unnoticed during optical and electron microscopy inspection .",
    "these may be the result of a uniaxial residual tension in the drum , introduced while peeling - off the graphene flake during the transfer to the substrate  @xcite .",
    "similar effects were observed in all studied drums , and it can thus be expected from this work that these are inherent to suspended two - dimensional materials fabricated by exfoliation and dry transfer . a finite - element calculation that takes this feature into account results in a better agreement between the predicted mode shapes and the measurements , as is discussed in supplementary section 4 .",
    "+ besides the displacements on resonance described above , other parameters can be visualized with spatial resolution .",
    "for example , the local resonance frequency , the q - factor and the noise floor give a wealth of information about the device and the detector , such as the local temperature distribution in the device , and the local reflectivity of the substrate .",
    "these examples are discussed in more detail in supplementary section 5 .",
    "spatially resolved measurements are a valuable tool to analyse the dynamic properties of two - dimensional materials , and may be used to address open questions such as the origin of their low mechanical q - factors  @xcite , as well as to assess fabrication quality and reproducibility .",
    "these are essential in order to exploit opportunities that arise in new applications as hybrid nano - electromechanical systems , that fuse excellent mechanical properties with exotic traits such as a negative thermal expansion coefficient and poisson s ratio  @xcite and electromechanical  @xcite and optoelectronic couplings  @xcite .",
    "+ in conclusion , we visualize the motion of micrometer - scale graphene drums vibrating at very high frequencies with a lateral resolution of @xmath58 and a displacement resolution of @xmath59 .",
    "the driven and non - driven thermal displacement profiles of the radially symmetric drum reveal the motion associated with nanomechanical resonance peaks up to the eighth vibrational mode .",
    "the spatial technique presented in this work complements the frequency- and time - domain techniques presently available , and is crucial to obtain a complete description of the dynamic behaviour of suspended two - dimensional materials .",

    "metallic islands are fabricated , which serve as a hard mask during the subsequent reactive ion etching of @xmath62 .",
    "the thickness of the metallization was chosen to obtain a cavity depth of @xmath63 , which optimizes the responsivity of interferometric measurements at the wavelength of the probing laser ( @xmath64 ) , as is described in detail in supplementary section 2 . in the final step , few - layer graphene flakes are mechanically exfoliated from natural crystals and deposited on top of the substrates using a dry transfer method  @xcite .",
    "the suspended graphene drum is electrostatically driven by applying a voltage , @xmath65 to the aupd pad , while connecting the si back - gate to ground .",
