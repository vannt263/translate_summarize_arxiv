    "in the interstellar space silicates get modified , destroyed and potentially reformed , they play an important role in the cosmic life cycle of matter . as an important component of circumstellar and interstellar dust ,",
    "silicates provide information about the size of grains and the chemical composition of dust .",
    "their mid - infrared spectral features can help us to get the information about the density and thermal structure of circumstellar disks and envelopes ( see * ? ? ?",
    "all the earlier observations showed that the feature bands of silicates are broad and smooth around 9.7@xmath0 m and 18@xmath0 m respectively .",
    "@xcite used laboratory data to identify the carrier of these features to be amorphous olivine silicates .",
    "later , the infrared space observatory ( iso ) and the _ spitzer _ space telescope obtained a lot of infrared spectra with high sensitivity and high resolution , which opened a new window for us to identify and investigate the spectral features of crystalline silicates . @xcite",
    "systematically studied the spectral features of crystalline silicate and diversified them into 7 distinct complexes using the iso / sws ( short wavelength spectrometer ) and lws ( long wavelength spectrometer ) spectra , which are called the 10@xmath1 ( 7 - 13@xmath1 ) , 18@xmath1 ( 15 - 20@xmath1 , ) , 23@xmath1 ( 22 - 25.5@xmath1 , ) , 28@xmath1 ( 26.5 - 31.5@xmath1 ) , 33@xmath1 ( 31.5 - 37.5@xmath1 ) , 40@xmath1 ( 38 - 44.5@xmath1 ) and 69@xmath1 ( 50 - 72@xmath1 ) complex respectively .",
    "crystalline silicates have been identified in various scales ( solar system , stars , galaxies and quasars ) , such as comet , protoplanetary disk of herbig ae / be stars and t tauri stars , debris disks around the main sequence stars , circumstellar envelopes in post - main sequence stars @xcite , very bright infrared galaxies @xcite , quasars @xcite , etc .    in this work ,",
    "we present a systematic search for the spectra with features of crystalline silicates from the _ spitzer _ irs enhanced products @xcite . in section  [ sec : dd ] , a brief description is presented about the _ spitzer _ irs enhanced products @xcite .",
    "the method we used is manifold ranking ( mr ) algorithm firstly proposed by @xcite , which will be described in section  [ sec : mr ] .",
    "the selected objects with crystalline silicate features are cross identified with the simbad database as well as with the lamost optical spectroscopy in section  [ sec : id ] .",
    "spectra taken by the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) @xcite on the _ spitzer _ space telescope @xcite are now publicly available .",
    "these spectra are produced using the bksub.tbl products from sl and ll modules of final ssc pipeline , version 18.18 . from the irs data archive , we found a collection of 16986 low - resolution spectra .",
    "the spectra are merged by 4 slits which are sl2 ( 5.21@xmath27.56@xmath0 m ) , sl1 ( 7.57@xmath214.28@xmath0 m ) , ll2 ( 14.29@xmath220.66@xmath0 m ) and ll1 ( 20.67@xmath238.00@xmath0 m ) . as crystalline silicates have no features in the sl2 band , we choose the spectra which include all the other three bands sl1 , ll2 and ll1 so that the object has a continuous spectrum from about 7.5@xmath1 to 38@xmath1 . in this way , five of the seven infrared complexes of crystalline silicates are covered , i.e. the 10 , 18 , 23 , 28 and 33@xmath1 complexes . consequently",
    ", 9711 spectra are picked up .",
    "[ fig:1 ] shows the s / n distribution of these 9711 spectra for the three irs slits respectively . in order to reduce the noise , median",
    "filtering is applied .",
    "the main idea of median filtering is to run through the spectrum pixel by pixel , replacing each pixel with the median of neighboring pixels .",
    "here we use median filtering with a width of 5 pixels which means each pixel is replaced with the median of 5 neighboring pixels . because the spectral features of silicate dust , even of crystalline silicate , are much wider than the atomic and ionic lines , they are not affected by the median filtering .",
    "[ fig:3 ] compares the spectrum before and after the median filtering and proves its efficiency in depressing the high - frequency noise and spikes .",
    "considering a sample set @xmath3 , the first @xmath4 units are labelled and belong to the same class ( here are the known spectra with crystalline silicate features ) , and the rest are unlabelled ( here are 9711 spectra from the _ spitzer _ irs ) .",
    "our task is to retrieve the units similar to the labelled ones . in general , the labelled sample is much smaller compared with the whole sample , namely @xmath5 .",

    "@xmath14 represents similarity between unit @xmath7 and @xmath15 and is defined by : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the distance between @xmath7 and @xmath15 , here we use the euclidean distance , and @xmath18 is a constant that controls the strength of the weight .",

    "iterate @xmath21 until convergence , where @xmath22 is a parameter in ( 0,1 ) .",
    "the intuitive description of this step is that all the units spread their scores to the nearby units via the weighted graph .",
    "4 .   let @xmath23 , sort @xmath24 in descending order and return index rank .",

    "we randomly select a given number @xmath28 of spectra with crystalline silicates features from the 38 sources to compose the labelled sample , while the non - selected spectra with crystalline silicates features and all the 9711 spectra from _",

    "868 spectra are found to show crystalline silicates features ( see table  [ tab : mr ] ) . from table  [",

    "[ fig : snr868 ] indicates that most of the sources have @xmath35 in the sl1 and ll2 bands ( @xmath36 ) , much better than the average of primordial 9711 sample objects .",
    "we consider that the observed flux is contributed by dust continuum ( @xmath37 ) , and dust spectral features from both amorphous silicate ( @xmath38 ) and crystalline silicate ( @xmath39 ) : @xmath40 for each spectrum , we first modeled the dust continuum by fitting a piecewise polynomial of degree 3 to anchor points . following the analysis of @xcite , we selected the following anchor points : 7.57 - 7.94 , 13.02 - 13.50 , 30.16 - 32.19 , and 35.07 - 35.92@xmath1 which are not affected by solid - state emission features .",

    "the absorption efficiency of amorphous silicate is based on the optical constants of @xcite assuming the dust to be spherical with radii @xmath45 , following the numerals of @xcite .",

    "the residual after subtracting the dust continuum and the spectral features of amorphous silicate is taken to be the spectral features of crystalline silicate .",
    "[ fig : con ] shows an example .",
    "it can be seen that the amorphous silicate features take a priority over the crystalline silicate since fitting the amorphous spectral features are maximized to match the spectrum after the continuum is subtracted .",
    "this fitting may under - estimate the intensity of the spectral features of crystalline silicate , which means we are obtaining a lower limit of the intensity ratio of crystalline to amorphous silicate s features in the following .",
    "the intensity of crystalline silicate bands is measured in order to understand their properties in relation to stellar parameters . here",

    "the significance level of the crystalline silicate is calculated in each band as @xmath48 where @xmath39 is crystalline silicate flux and @xmath49 is the uncertainty in the measured flux , @xmath50 @xmath51 where @xmath18 is statistical uncertainty in each resolved element of the spectra , and @xmath52 is the uncertainty in the determination of the underlying continuum and amorphous silicate , which we conservatively assumed to be 10% ( @xmath53 ) . *",
    "the value of @xmath52 is the same as that adopted by @xcite since we both deal with the _",

    "the 868 spectra are cross identified with the simbad database to learn the types of sources and the results are presented in table  [ tab:2 ] . removing duplicate sources , there are 790 sources whose classification is summarized in table  [ tab:3 ] .",
    "many of the sources are in the early stage of evolution , including the orion - type variables , t tauri stars , pre - main sequence stars , herbig ae / be stars , fu ori type .",
    "the second most popular class is in the late stage of evolution .",
    "they are mostly the low - mass evolved stars such as agb stars , oh / ir stars , post - agb stars or proto - planetary nebulae , and planetary nebulae , as well as carbon stars and s - type stars . at the same time , the massive stars in late stage of evolution are also present , such as red and blue supergiants .",
    "the detection of crystalline silicate has been reported widely in the early and late stage of stellar evolution .",
    "in addition , crystalline silicate emission is found in different types of variables , such as nova , by dra type , rr lyr type , delta sct type , and several types of long - period pulsating variables .",

    "confirmation of these types of objects needs more serious investigation .",
    "the average spectrum is calculated for the types which have more than five objects by a weighted mean according to the flux intensity .",
    "it should be noted that the objects can be generally divided into two major classes , i.e. the young stellar objects and the evolved stars , even though the simbad types are various .",
    "the young stellar objects may include all the types in the early stage of evolution , such as pre - main sequence star and proto - star , while pre - main sequence star may include the low - mass t tau - type star ( which can also be orion - type variable ) and massive herbig ae / be star . on the other hand , agb star , oh / ir star , post - agb star , planetary nebula etc .",

    "[ fig : avefig ] ( e ) .",
    "it can be seen that the young stellar objects generally have colder continuum than evolved stars . in respect to the spectral features of crystalline silicate , the evolved stars have wider feature around 10@xmath1 , and show a more evident peak at about 11.2@xmath1 . in comparison with the absorption coefficient of typical crystalline silicates ",
    "forsterite and enstatite , such profile points to a richer amount of forsterite in the evolved stars than in young stellar objects .",
    "consistently , the features at 20@xmath1 and 24@xmath1 of forsterite are also prominent .",
    "nevertheless , it should be noted that the young stellar objects exhibit diversity among sub - types : t tau - type stars have a raised red wing like evolved stars , herbig ae / be star have a raised blue wing , while the orion - type variables show a flat top around 10@xmath1 . such distinction between t tau - type stars and herbig",
    "ae / be stars is different from previous studies .",
    "it was believed that the spectra of t tau - type stars in the 10@xmath1 range trace the warm inner disk and thus show more enstatite features ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) while herbig ae / be stars trace the cold outer disk and thus more forsterite features ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our average spectra show a contrary tendency . * a possible reason for this discrepancy is that the average spectrum may be affected by the dust continuum . removing the dust continuum emission",
    ", we can see that the t tau - type stars show the features dominated by enstatite and the herbig ae / be stars show the features dominated by forsterite in the 10@xmath1 range as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : avefig ] ( f ) .",
    "this is then consistent with previous conclusion .",
    "* on the other hand , the evolved stars conform to the average spectrum .",
    "agb stars , oh / ir stars , post - agb stars and planetary nebulae all point to a raised red wing of the 10@xmath1 feature , indicating the dominant role of forsterite .",
    "this consistent scenario implies similar condition for crystallization of silicate dust in the circumstellar envelope of evolved stars .",
    "one exception is the rv tau - type variables which shows no dominance of spectral features of forsterite .",
    "as rv tau - type stars are usually post - agb stars in a binary system , there may be disk - like structure to influence the composition of crystalline silicate .    the identified sample is also cross matched with the lamost / dr2 catalog resulting in 91 identifications . as lamost is an optical spectroscopic survey ,",

    "<S> the crystalline silicates features are mainly reflected in infrared bands . </S>",
    "<S> the _ spitzer _ infrared spectrograph ( irs ) collected numerous spectra of various objects and provided a big database to investigate crystalline silicates in a wide range of astronomical environments . </S>",
    "<S> we apply the manifold ranking algorithm to perform a systematic search for the spectra with crystalline silicates features in the _ spitzer _ irs enhanced products available . in total , 868 spectra of 790 sources are found to show the features of crystalline silicate . </S>",
    "<S> these objects are cross - matched with the simbad database as well as with the large sky area multi - object fibre spectroscopic telescope ( lamost)/dr2 . the average spectrum of young stellar objects show a variety of features dominated either by forsterite or enstatite or neither , while the average spectrum of evolved objects consistently present dominant features of forsterite in agb , oh / ir , post - agb and planetary nebulae . </S>",
    "<S> they are identified optically as early - type stars , evolved stars , galaxies and so on . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the strength of spectral features in typical silicate complexes is calculated . </S>",
    "<S> the results are available through cds for the astronomical community to further study crystalline silicate . </S>"
