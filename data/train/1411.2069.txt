    "the notion of a perfect graph was introduced by berge in the early 1960s @xcite .",
    "a graph is called _ perfect _ if each of its induced subgraphs has chromatic number equal to the size of a maximum cardinality clique in the subgraph .",
    "perfect graphs have caught the attention of many researchers in the area and inspired numerous interesting contributions to the literature for the past fifty years .",
    "one of the main results in the seminal paper of grtschel , lovsz and schrijver @xcite is that perfect graphs constitute a graph class where the maximum weight stable set problem ( mwssp ) can be solved in polynomial time .",
    "some years later , the same authors proved a very beautiful , related result which connects a purely graph theoretic notion to polyhedrality of a typically nonlinear convex relaxation and to the integrality and equality of two fundamental polytopes :    [ thm : gls ] ( grtschel , lovsz and schrijver @xcite ) for every graph @xmath2 , the following are equivalent :    1 .",

    "@xmath7    in the above theorem , @xmath8 is the stable set polytope of @xmath2 , @xmath9 is its clique relaxation and @xmath10 is the _ theta body _ of @xmath2 defined by lovsz @xcite .    in the early 1990s , lovsz and",
    "schrijver @xcite introduced the semidefinite relaxation @xmath11 of @xmath8 which is stronger than @xmath10 .",
    "following the same line of reasoning used for perfect graphs , they proved that mwssp can be solved in polynomial time for the class of graphs for which @xmath12 .",
    "we call these graphs _ @xmath1-perfect graphs",
    "the set of @xmath1-perfect graphs is known to contain many rich and interesting classes of graphs ( e.g. , perfect graphs , @xmath13-perfect graphs , wheels , anti - holes , near - bipartite graphs ) and their clique sums . however , no combinatorial characterization of @xmath1-perfect graphs have been obtained so far .",
    "there are many studies of various variants of lift - and - project operators applied to the relaxations of the stable set problem ( see for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "why study @xmath0-perfect graphs ?",
    "for example , if we want to characterize the largest family of graphs for which mwssp can be solved in polynomial time , then perhaps , we should pick a tractable relaxation of @xmath8 that is as strong as possible .",
    "this reasoning would suggest that , we should focus on the strongest , tractable lift - and - project operator and reiterate it as much as possible while maintaining tractability of the underlying relaxation . even though the ( lower bound ) analysis for the strongest lift - and - project operators is typically challenging , indeed , some work on the behaviour of the strongest lift - and - project operators applied to the stable set problem already exists ( see @xcite and the references therein ) . in the spectrum of strong lift - and - project operators which utilize positive semidefiniteness constraints ,",
    "given the above results of grtschel , lovsz and schrijver , it seems clear to us that we should pick an operator that is at least as strong as @xmath10 . among many of the convex relaxations that are closely related to @xmath10 but stronger",
    ", @xmath10 continues to emerge as the central object with quite special mathematical properties ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "given that the operator @xmath14 can be defined as the intersection of the matrix - space liftings of the odd - cycle polytope of @xmath2 and the theta body of @xmath2 , by definition , @xmath14 encodes and retains very interesting combinatorial information about the graph @xmath2 .",
    "then , the next question is why not focus on iterated ( hence stronger ) operator @xmath15 for @xmath16 but small enough to maintain tractability ?",
    "the answer to this is related to the above ; but , it is a bit more subtle : in the lifted , matrix - space representation of @xmath0 , if we remove the positive semidefiniteness constraint , we end up with the lifting of the operator @xmath17 ( defined later ) . in this lifted matrix space ,",
    "if we remove the restriction that the matrix be symmetric , we end up with the lifting of a weaker relaxation @xmath18 .",

    "one of our main goals in this line of research is to obtain a characterization of @xmath1-perfect graphs similar to the one given in theorem [ thm : gls ] for perfect graphs .",
    "more precisely , we would like to find an appropriate polyhedral relaxation of @xmath8 playing the role of @xmath9 in theorem [ thm : gls ] , when we replace @xmath10 by @xmath11 .",
    "in @xcite we introduced the polyhedral relaxation @xmath23 of @xmath8 , which is , to the best of our knowledge , the tightest polyhedral relaxation of @xmath11 . roughly speaking ,",
    "@xmath23 is defined by the family of facets of stable set polytopes of a family of graphs that are built from _ near - bipartite graphs _ by using simple operations so that the the stable set polytope of the resulting graph does not have any facets outside the class of facets which define the stable set polytope of near - bipartite graphs ( for a precise definition of @xmath23 , see section  [ sec : definitions ] ) . in our quest to obtain the desired characterization of @xmath1-perfect graphs , @xmath23 is our current best guess for replacing @xmath9 in theorem [ thm : gls ] .",
