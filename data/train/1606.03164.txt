    "the currently running lhc has not only provided new smoking gun signatures of possible physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) but also confirmed some of the prevailing tensions in the sm .",
    "the most striking example of the confirmation of previously observed anomaly is the 3.5@xmath11 deviation from the sm expectation of the ratio @xmath12 @xmath13@xcite .",
    "this is an indication towards lepton flavor non universality , in disagreement with the sm predictions .",
    "the idea of lepton flavour non universality is further bolstered by the measurement that @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the four fermion interaction @xmath15 , which induces the decays @xmath16 , occurs at the tree level within the sm .",
    "note that the situation in the case of @xmath17 is quite different because this transition occurs only at one loop level in sm .",
    "relatively large new physics ( np ) contributions are required to explain the anomaly in the measurement of @xmath18 .",
    "such large contributions are more likely to occur in np models where the four fermion interaction occurs at tree level .",
    "however such models must also be consistent with the measurement of other observables which are in agreement with their sm predictions . as a result",
    "there are only a limited a set of np models which can explain the @xmath18 anomaly , see for example @xcite . in particular , ref .",
    "@xcite listed all the four fermion operators contributing to @xmath19 and derived the values of various np couplings which satisfy the measurement of @xmath9 and the @xmath10 spectra .",
    "the next step is to discriminate between various np operators which can explain the excess in @xmath18 .",
    "this can be achieved if we have a handle on various angular observables in @xmath20 similar to the ones we have in @xmath21 decay . in the semileptonic decays of pseudoscalar mesons to vector mesons",
    ", it is possible to measure differential distributions with respect to three angles , besides @xmath22 .",
    "these angles are usually defined in the vector meson rest frame . for the decay @xmath23 ,",
    "these angles are ( a ) @xmath2 , the angle between @xmath3 and @xmath4 where the @xmath4 meson comes from @xmath7 decay , ( b ) @xmath24 , the angle between @xmath25 and @xmath3 and ( c ) @xmath26 , the angle between @xmath7 decay plane and the plane defined by the lepton momenta @xcite .",
    "a study of these angular distributions , in the case of @xmath27 , has revealed significant discrepancies between the measurements and the predictions of sm @xcite .",
    "various authors have done theoretical analysis of similar angular distributions for @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "so far the @xmath25 lepton has not been reconstructed in any of the experiments which measured @xmath9 .",
    "therefore @xmath24 and @xmath26 have not been measured .",
    "hence it is not possible to measure the full differential distribution .",
    "however , it is possible to measure @xmath2 from the same data used by babar and belle to determine @xmath0 . from the @xmath2 distribution one can extract the @xmath7 polarization fraction @xmath8 . in this letter",
    "we study the capability of @xmath8 to discriminate between various np solutions which account for @xmath0 excess .",
    "first we summarize the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , which performed a fit of various np models to the present @xmath18 and @xmath29 data .",
    "these fits are also consistent with the @xmath10 distribution provided by babar @xcite and belle @xcite .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for the quark level transition @xmath30 is given by    @xmath31\\ , , \\label{effh}\\ ] ]    where the scale @xmath32 is assumed to be 1 tev .",
    "the lorentz structures of the unprimed @xmath33 and primed @xmath34 and @xmath35 operators are given in table  [ tab : ops ] .",
    "for each primed operator , this table also lists the corresponding fierz transformed unprimed operator .",
    "the values of all operator coefficients which provide a good fit to the data are given in table [ tab1 ] .",
    ".all possible four - fermion operators that can contribute to @xmath36 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it would be interesting to see the discrimination capability of the asymmetries based on other angular observables .",
    "one such example is the forward - backward asymmetry of leptons , @xmath37 in @xmath28 .",
    "the values of @xmath37 for the six different np combinations listed in table [ tab1 ] are plotted in various panels of fig .",
    "[ afb ] . here",
    "again the blue band represents the sm and the red and the black bands represent np solutions . as in the case of @xmath8 ,",
    "the plots of @xmath37 distinguish the np solutions from sm for the following cases:(i ) only @xmath38 present , ( ii ) @xmath39 and @xmath40 present and ( iii ) the two disallowed solutions of @xmath41 and @xmath42 present .",
    "for the two cases , only @xmath43 present and @xmath44 and @xmath45 present , @xmath37 is essentially the same as that of sm , which is also true for @xmath46 .",
    "the results for the sixth case , only @xmath42 present , are quite interesting .",
    "this case could not be distinguished from sm with @xmath8 but it can be with @xmath37 .",
    "this can be seen in the right panel of the top row of fig .",
    "[ afb ] .",
    "the angle @xmath24 has to be measured to determine @xmath37 . as mentioned before ,",
    "such a measurement is not possible so far . it may be possible for lhcb to make this measurement for those events where @xmath25 decays into multiple hadrons , using the same technique they used to identify the @xmath3 meson in the decay @xmath23 . but as demonstrated in figs .",
    "[ flq - mi ] and [ afb ] the only advantage of making this measurement is to distinguish the solution where only @xmath42 is present .",
    "as emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite , a solution to @xmath47 anomaly is possible only if the coefficients of np operators are moderately large .",
    "such large coefficients occur only if these operators arise at tree level . in certain models",
    "such operators arise due to the exchange of leptoquarks at tree level .",
    "a number of leptoquark models have been constructed to account for @xmath47 anomaly @xcite .",
    "here we consider the effective np couplings derived from leptoquark models in ref .",
    "for a scalar leptoquark @xmath48 , with @xmath49 charge @xmath50 , the effective np couplings are @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "as discussed earlier , the operator @xmath53 has the fierz transformed form @xmath54 , the sm operator .",
    "hence neither @xmath8 nor @xmath37 can distinguish this np solution .",
    "for the case of a vector leptoquark @xmath55 , with @xmath49 charge @xmath56 , the np operator leading to @xmath57 decay is @xmath58 which again has the fierz transformation to @xmath54 .",
    "hence this np solution also can not be distinguished through either @xmath8 or @xmath37 .",
    "in this letter , we studied the possibility to distinguish between various models which can explain the observed excess in @xmath0 .",
    "the angular observables in the decay @xmath57 can discriminate between np operators whose lorentz structure is different from that of sm . the @xmath7 polarization , @xmath8 , and the lepton forward - backward asymmetry , @xmath37 , are both capable of distinguishing between three of the six allowed np solutions .",
    "a measurement of @xmath37 is not possible with present techniques .",
    "however , @xmath8 can be determined from the same data which measured @xmath0 .",
    "therefore a measurement of this quantity will be of great value in narrowing down the allowed np models .",
