    "superconductivity in @xmath1-electron systems , whose history dates back to studies on graphite intercalation compounds in 60s,@xcite has attracted broad interest in condensed matter physics . recently , two seminal discoveries for carbon - based superconductors have been reported .",
    "one is a15/fcc 3c60 , with a new method to synthesize highly crystalline samples.@xcite the observed superconducting transition temperatures ( @xmath2 ) for the high - pressure samples are found to be as high as 38 k for a15 and 35 k for fcc .",
    "the other is potassium - doped solid picene,@xcite which opened a new avenue to various ` _ aromatic superconductors _ ' , for which the maximum @xmath2 has reached 33 k.@xcite    the mechanism of superconductivity of these new superconductors has not been fully understood . for alkali - doped fullerides , while there are several experimental reports which seemingly support the conventional bcs mechanism , various indications for unconventional superconductivity have been also observed .",
    "for example , although the positive correlation between @xmath2 and the lattice constant found in k- and rb - doped fullerides has been understood in terms of the standard bcs theory,@xcite more recent experiments for larger cations have revealed that @xmath2 does not necessarily behave monotonically as a function of the lattice parameters.@xcite the fact that the superconducting phase has a dome - like shape in the phase diagram is indeed reminiscent of cuprates@xcite and unconventional organic superconductors such as bedt - ttf.@xcite in addition , these new 60 superconductors are insulators at ambient pressure,@xcite indicating that the superconducting phase resides in the vicinity of an insulating phase .",
    "in fact , considering these characteristic features , it has been proposed that interplay between orbital , spin , and lattice degrees of freedom is the origin of the high @xmath2 superconductivity.@xcite    for aromatic superconductors , following the discovery of k - doped picene ( c@xmath3h@xmath4),@xcite it has been found that various hydrocarbon compounds such as coronene ( c@xmath5h@xmath6 ) , phenanthrene ( c@xmath4h@xmath7 ) , and 1,2:8,9-dibenzopentacene ( c@xmath8h@xmath9 ) also exhibit superconductivity.@xcite diversity of hydrocarbon molecules suggests the possibility of new and higher @xmath2 aromatic superconductors . so far , electronic structure,@xcite electronic correlations,@xcite electron - phonon interactions,@xcite and exciton / plasmon properties of the normal state@xcite have been studied , while studies on superconducting properties are still limited .",
    "the pairing mechanism is totally an open question .",
    "there are several similarities between 60 and aromatic superconductors ; they are both molecular solids having narrow bands around the fermi level , whose energy scale competes with that of electron - phonon and electron - electron interactions .",
    "the competition among these three factors is a characteristic aspect of carbon - based materials . _",
    "ab initio _ derivations of effective low - energy models for these compounds are important to make the situation transparent and to clarify the origin of their high @xmath2 superconductivity . by comparing the parameters in the effective models for the 60 and aromatic superconductors ,",
    "the differences and similarities are quantitatively identified and analyzed .",
    "recent methodology for construction of the electronic model , based on the combination use of the maximally localized wannier orbital ( mlwo ) ( ref .  ) and the constrained random phase approximation ( crpa ) ,  @xcite extends its applicability range .",
    "it does not place limitations on the character of basis orbitals of the effective model , whether atomic or molecular .",
    "indeed , it has already been applied to various complex systems such as bedt - ttf ( refs .   and ) or zeolites.@xcite while electronic interaction parameters of the 60 and aromatic superconductors have been estimated by various methods,@xcite explicit and direct comparison of these systems by the same method has yet to be done .",
    "thus it is imperative to evaluate the interaction parameters of 60 and aromatic superconductors by exploiting the state - of - the - art technique and perform a systematic comparison . in the present study",
    ", we constructed _ ab initio _ extended hubbard models which describe the low - energy electronic structure of twelve examples of c@xmath0 and aromatic compounds .",
    "the transfer integrals were given as matrix elements of the kohn - sham hamiltonian in the wannier basis .",
    "the interaction parameters were evaluated by calculating the wannier matrix elements of the screened coulomb interaction , which is obtained by crpa .",
    "the estimated correlation strength as the ratio of the interaction energy to the kinetic one is nearly or beyond unity for the studied materials , indicating that both the c@xmath0 and aromatic systems are classified into a strongly correlated electron systems . on the other hand",
    ", we observed a notable difference between the two systems ; for the c@xmath0 system , there exist positive correlation regime in the correlation strength and the experimental @xmath10 .",
    "in contrast , the aromatic system exhibits negative correlation between these two quantities .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : method ] , we show how to construct the low - energy models from _ ab initio _ calculations . in sec.[sec :",
    "result ] , we show the calculated band structure , mlwos , transfer integrals , and effective interaction parameters .",
    "we discuss the material dependence of the derived parameters and relation between the strength of electronic correlation and superconductivity in sec.[sec : discuss ] .",
    "finally we give a summary in sec.[sec : summary ] .",
    "we derive electronic low - energy models with the combination of mlwo and crpa .",
    "this method has widely been applied to the derivation of effective models for 3@xmath11 transition metals ,  @xcite their oxides ,  @xcite organic conductors ,  @xcite zeolites ,  @xcite iron - based superconductors ,  @xcite and 5@xmath11 transition metal oxides.@xcite we first perform band calculations based on density functional theory ( dft ) ,  @xcite and choose ` target bands ' of the effective model . by constructing mlwos for the target bands , we calculate transfer integrals and effective interactions in the effective model . in the calculation of the effective interaction , the screening by electrons besides target - band electrons",
    "is considered within crpa ( see below ) .",
    "we apply this scheme to the derivation of effective models , i.e. , extended multi - orbital hubbard models , for the c@xmath0 and aromatic compounds .",
    "the hamiltonian consists of the transfer part @xmath12 , the coulomb repulsion part @xmath13 , and the exchange interactions and pair hopping part @xmath14 defined as @xmath15 where @xmath16 with @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) being a creation ( annihilation ) operator of an electron with spin @xmath19 in the @xmath20-th mlwo localized at a c@xmath0 or aromatic hydrocarbon molecule located at @xmath21 and @xmath22=@xmath21@xmath23@xmath24 .",
    "the parameters @xmath25 represent an onsite energy ( @xmath22=@xmath26 ) and hopping integrals ( @xmath22@xmath27@xmath26 ) , which are described with the translational symmetry as @xmath28 where @xmath29=@xmath30 and @xmath31 is the kohn - sham hamiltonian .    to evaluate effective interaction parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 , we calculate the screened coulomb interaction @xmath34 at the low - frequency limit .",
    "we first calculate non - interacting polarization function @xmath35 with excluding polarization processes within the target bands .",
    "note that screening by the target electrons is considered when we solve the effective models , so that we have to avoid double counting of it when we derive the effective models . with the resulting @xmath35 , the @xmath36 interaction is calculated as @xmath36=@xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the bare coulomb interaction @xmath39=@xmath40 .",
    "once screened coulomb interaction @xmath41 is calculated , the matrix elements of @xmath36 are obtained as @xmath42 and @xmath43 for comparison with the crpa results , we calculate interaction parameters with different levels of screening .",
    "one is the unscreened one , i.e. , the bare coulomb interaction , and the other is the fully - screened one where we calculate @xmath35 including the target - band screening . to distinguish these from crpa , we denote them as ` bare ' and ` frpa ' .",

    "the three samples are specified with the c@xmath47 volume and corresponds to those in the superconducting phase with maximum @xmath2 ( 1 ) , in the vicinity of the metal - insulator transition ( 1 ) , and in the anti - ferromagnetic insulating phase ( 1 ) , respectively . for a15 structure",

    "the total number of bands considered in the polarization function was set to 335 ( 120 occupied+3 target+212 unoccupied ) for fcc 3c60 , 670 ( 240 occupied+6 target+424 unoccupied ) for a15 3c60 , 310 ( 102 occupied+4 target+204 unoccupied ) for solid 1 , 315 ( 108 occupied+4 target+203 unoccupied ) for solid 1 , and 270 ( 66 occupied+4 target+200 unoccupied ) for solid 1 .",
    "the brillouin - zone integral on wavevector was evaluated by generalized tetrahedron method.@xcite a problem due to the singularity of long - wavelength - limit coulomb interaction in the evaluation of the wannier matrix elements , @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) and @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) , was treated in the manner described in ref . .",
    "the onsite interactions are specified by @xmath51=@xmath52 and @xmath53=@xmath54 and @xmath55=@xmath56 for @xmath20@xmath27@xmath57 . in the case of 60 compounds , @xmath51 , @xmath58 , and @xmath55",
    "take only one value according to the symmetry .",
    "for aromatic compounds , @xmath51 is different for two orbitals , so we present two values .",
    "we also denote the coulomb repulsion between the neighboring sites as @xmath59 .",
    "table [ tab_e1 ] shows our calculated interaction parameters @xmath51 , @xmath58 , @xmath55 , and @xmath59 with three screening levels ( ` bare ' , ` crpa ' , and ` frpa ' ) .",
    "we see that the value of the coulomb repulsion decreases as the screening processes increases . in the 60 compounds ,",
    "the bare value is @xmath603.4 ev and after considering the screening by crpa , the value is reduced to @xmath601 ev . by taking account of the intra - target - band screening by frpa ,",
    "the value is further reduced to @xmath600.1 ev .",
    "it should be noted here that the material dependence of the bare values in fcc or a15 is small ; for example , 3.27 ev for fcc - k and 3.37 for fcc - cs(1 ) .",
    "the difference is nearly 3 % .",
    "this difference is ascribed to the difference in the spatial spread of mlwos ( see table [ tab_w ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the material difference in the crpa values is beyond 20 % ; 0.82 ev for fcc - k and 1.07 for fcc - cs(1 ) .",
    "indeed , this appreciable difference originates from the difference in the macroscopic dielectric constant defined as @xmath61 with @xmath62 being frequency and @xmath63=@xmath64+@xmath65 , where @xmath64 is a wave vector in the first brillouin zone and @xmath65 is a reciprocal lattice vector .",
    "we list the value in the bottom of the table .",
    "we see that the material dependence of @xmath66 is appreciable as 5.6 for fcc - k and 4.4 for fcc - cs(1 ) , clearly indicating the importance of the screening effect in addition to the spatial wannier spread .    for the aromatic compounds , differences in both the bare interaction and the screening effect",
    "contribute to the material dependence of the crpa values ; the bare interactions are @xmath67@xmath60 @xmath68@xmath69 @xmath70 and after consideration of the crpa screening , we obtain @xmath71@xmath69 @xmath72@xmath60 @xmath73 .",
    "especially , in 1 , the dielectric constant is markedly high as @xmath6012,@xcite making the crpa @xmath51 value small appreciably .",
    "we finally remark some points : as for the 60 compounds , the equality @xmath58@xmath60@xmath51@xmath23@xmath74 holds among effective parameters .",
    "this relationship also roughly holds for the aromatic compounds .",
    "the present @xmath51 value of crpa for the 60 compounds are small compared to the previous estimates of @xmath51 ( @xmath601 - 1.5ev).@xcite for all materials , the crpa coulomb interaction decays as @xmath75 with @xmath76 being the distance between the centers of mlwos , while the frpa coulomb interaction is limited to be short ranged due to the metallic screening ( see table  [ tab_e1 ] ) .",
    "we note that the frpa @xmath51 gives an opposite trend to the bare and crpa @xmath51 ; for example , in the fcc 60 compounds , the frpa value slightly decreases as proceeding from fcc - k to fcc - cs(1 ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the coulomb interaction is efficiently screened due to the increase in the density of states accompanied by the decrease of bandwidth .",
    "we also found that , in these systems , the exchange interaction @xmath55 are also efficiently screened ; i.e. , @xmath77@xmath600.3 .",
    "this makes a clear contrast to the case of the inorganic materials as @xmath77@xmath600.8 such as @xmath78 transition metals,@xcite its oxides srvo@xmath79,@xcite and iron - based superconductors.@xcite",
    "let us move on to the comparison of the effective interaction parameters among the twelve compounds .",
    "figure [ fig_comp ] summarizes the results of the crpa calculation ; the onsite coulomb repulsion @xmath80 averaged over mlwos derived from the target band , the onsite exchange interaction @xmath55 , the offsite interaction @xmath81 averaged over nearest - neighbor sites , and the ratio @xmath82 which measures the correlation strength in the system .",
    "note that the net interaction is estimated as @xmath83 , based on the analysis of the extended hubbard model .",
    "as for the 60 systems , we see that @xmath80 has appreciable material dependence , ranging from 0.8 ev to 1.1 ev [ fig .",
    "[ fig_comp](a ) ] .",
    "this is ascribed to the differences in the size of wannier orbitals and dielectric screening ( see sec .",
    "[ sub - int ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the material dependence of @xmath55 is weak and the value itself is negligibly small as @xmath600.03 ev [ fig . [",
    "fig_comp](b ) ] .",
    "in general , small @xmath55 favors low - spin states , as is observed in experiments .",
    "@xcite it is interesting to note that there is a proposal that the jahn - teller coupling dominates over the hund s rule coupling @xmath55 , and induces superconductivity with the help of sufficiently large @xmath51 .",
    "@xcite compared to @xmath55 , we found that @xmath81 is substantially large as @xmath600.3 ev , being as large as @xmath6025% of @xmath80 [ fig .",
    "[ fig_comp](c ) ] . as for @xmath36 , which measures kinetic energy , we observed a decreasing trend as the lattice constant increases [ fig .",
    "[ fig_comp](d ) ] .",
    "we also note that the energy scale for a15 3c60 is larger than that of fcc 3c60 as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sub_band ] .",
    "the derived correlation strength of @xmath82 exhibits a rather simple monotonic increasing behavior [ fig .",
    "[ fig_comp](e ) ] , with the lattice constant increase .",
    "the presented @xmath82@xmath601 indicates that 60 superconductors are categorized as strongly correlated electron systems .    for the aromatic superconductors",
    ", we found that the energy scale of @xmath80 is similar to that of the 60 superconductors [ fig .",
    "[ fig_comp](a ) ] . on the other hand , it is interesting to note that the aromatic superconductors tend to have larger @xmath55 and @xmath81 [ figs . [ fig_comp](b ) and ( c ) ] .",
    "we can also see that the material dependence of the interaction parameters among the aromatic superconductors is also more significant , since the size and shape of the aromatic molecules are quite different from each other . as for @xmath36",
    ", they are similar for the aromatic and 60 superconductors [ fig . [ fig_comp](d ) ] .",
    "we found that aromatic superconductors are also in strongly correlated regime as 60 ones , based on the analysis of the correlation strength [ fig .",
    "[ fig_comp](e ) ] .",
    "next , let us discuss the relation between electronic correlation and superconductivity for the 60 and aromatic superconductors . in figs .",
    "[ fig_tc ]  ( a ) and ( b ) , we plot the superconducting transition temperature @xmath2 and the nel temperature @xmath46 as a function of volume occupied per fulleride anion ( @xmath84 ) for fcc 3c60 and a15 3c60 , respectively ( see also table  [ tab_c60 ] ) . to see the relation between the electron correlation and the superconductivity we superpose a plot of @xmath82 on the phase diagram .",
    "we see that while @xmath82 and @xmath2 have a positive correlation up to @xmath84@xmath60760 - 770 @xmath85 , for larger @xmath84 , electron correlation becomes fatal for superconductivity and the system eventually becomes an insulator .",
    "we note that the critical value of @xmath82 for the mit sample is larger for fcc 3c60 ( @xmath601.9 ) than a15 3c60 ( @xmath601.2 ) . as discussed in ref .  , it is important to consider the influence of lattice and orbital structure on mit .",
    "@xcite    in fig .",
    "[ fig_tc](c ) , we plot @xmath2 and @xmath82 for the three aromatic superconductors , which shows a negative correlation .",
    "therefore , it seems that electronic correlation does not favor superconductivity in these aromatic superconductors .",
    "recently , doped 1,2:8,9-dibenzopentacene was found to have a quite high @xmath2@xmath6033 k. since 1,2:8,9-dibenzopentacene is a bigger molecule than picene , coronene , and phenanthrene , the former interaction is expected to be small compared to the latter ones , reflecting the large wannier spread of the 1,2:8,9-dibenzopentacene molecule . if there is no drastic change in the bandwidth @xmath36 , which is probable in terms of the tendency shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_comp](d ) , the weakest electronic correlation will be realized in doped 1,2:8,9-dibenzopentacene . this trend is consistent with fig .",
    "[ fig_tc](c )",
    ".    regarding the role of electronic correlation in the 60 and aromatic superconductors , there are two possibilities : the pairing mechanism in these compounds has a common root or these superconductors have completely different pairing glues .",
    "if we assume that the aromatic superconductors reside in the vicinity of the border between the superconducting and insulating phases , the first scenario is ( at least partially ) explicable to the behavior in fig .",
    "[ fig_tc ] . on the other hand , in the second scenario",
    ", the electronic correlation enhances superconductivity for the c@xmath0 compounds and inversely suppresses that for the aromatic compounds . in order to clarify this issue , experimental studies to determine the phase diagram for aromatic superconductors against temperature and volume occupied per anion are highly desired.@xcite theoretically ,",
    "microscopic calculations considering both electronic correlation and electron - lattice coupling are needed , which will be an interesting future problem .",
    "to provide insight into the role of electronic correlation in 60 and aromatic superconductors , we derived effective models for wide range of the examples ; fcc - k , fcc - rb , fcc - cs(1 ) , fcc - cs(1 ) , fcc - cs(1 ) , a15-cs(1 ) , a15-cs(1 ) , a15-cs(1 ) , solid 1 , 1 , and 1 . to define the basis orbital of the effective model , we constructed mlwos of isolated bands around the fermi level .",
    "transfer parameters are derived by evaluating the matrix elements of the kohn - sham hamiltonian between the mlwos .",
    "the low - energy electronic structures of the c@xmath0 compounds are highly symmetric and isotropic , so that the original gga band is reproduced with only 6 or 7 parameters . on the other hand ,",
    "the aromatic compounds have quite anisotropic electronic structure .    to quantify the strength of electronic correlation in these compounds , we estimated the effective interaction parameters such as @xmath51 , @xmath59 and @xmath55 , by means of the crpa method .",
    "it was found that , in addition to the appreciable reduction of the diagonal part of the coulomb interaction ( @xmath51 and @xmath59 ) , the off - diagonal part @xmath55 is also efficiently screened .",
    "interestingly , all the 60 and aromatic superconductors studied in the present work have a similar energy scale for the bandwidth and interaction parameters : @xmath36@xmath600.5 ev , @xmath51@xmath601 ev , @xmath55@xmath600.05 ev , @xmath59@xmath600.3 ev .",
    "this parameter range suggests that these compounds are a strongly correlated electron system .",
    "however , after examination of the material dependence , we found that a clear difference between the 60 and aromatic compounds in the relation between electronic correlation strength and @xmath2 ; i.e. , a positive correlation in the 60 system and a negative correlation in the aromatic system . in the present study , we focused on the derivation for the electronic part of the effective model . for deep understanding of the low - energy physics for the carbon - based materials , however , the derivation of the electron - phonon interaction part is also imperative .",
    "the derivation for this part includes subtle problems on the definition of the basis for the phonon mode ( refs . and ) and/or the exclusion of the double counting of the screening of the low - energy degree of freedoms , which needs the future studies .",
