    "our goal in this paper is to present a practical extension of the evans function shooting method to computing the stability of _ multi - dimensional _ travelling wave solutions to parabolic nonlinear systems .",
    "the problem is thus to solve the linear spectral equations for small perturbations of the travelling wave .",
    "hence we need to determine the values of the spectral parameter for which solutions _ match _ longitudinal far - field zero boundary conditions and , in more than one spatial dimension , the transverse boundary conditions .",
    "these are the _",
    "eigenvalues_. there are two main approaches to solving such eigenvalue problems .",
    "* _ projection : _ project the spectral equations onto a finite dimensional basis , which by construction satisfies the boundary conditions",
    ". then solve the resulting matrix eigenvalue problem . *",
    "_ shooting : _ start with a specific value of the spectral parameter and the correct boundary conditions at one end . shoot / integrate towards the far end . examine how close this solution is to satisfying the boundary conditions at the far end .",
    "re - adjust the spectral parameter accordingly .",
    "repeat the shooting procedure until the solution _ matches _ the far boundary conditions .",
    "the projection method can be applied to travelling waves of any dimension .",
    "its main disadvantage is that to increase accuracy or include adaptation is costly and complicated as we have to re - project onto the finer or adapted basis .",
    "further , from the set of eigenvalues that are produced by the resulting large algebraic eigenvalue problem , care must be taken to distinguish two subsets as follows . in the limit of vanishing discretization scale",
    ", one subset corresponds to isolated eigenvalues of finite multiplicity , while the other subset converges to the absolute or essential spectrum , depending on the boundary conditions ( see sandstede and scheel  @xcite ) .",
    "the latter subset can be detected by changing the truncated domain size and observing which eigenvalues drift in the complex spectral parameter plane .",
    "in contrast , for the shooting method , it is much easier to fine - tune accuracy and adaptivity , and zeros of the matching condition are isolated eigenvalues of finite multiplicity ( we do not have to worry about spurious eigenvalues as described above ) .",
    "its disadvantage though is that by its very description it is a one - dimensional method .    when implementing the shooting method , a wronskian - like determinant measuring the discrepancy in the boundary _ matching condition _ in the spectral problem is typically used to locate eigenvalues in the complex spectral parameter plane .",
    "this is known as the evans function or miss - distance function ",
    "see alexander , gardner and jones  @xcite or greenberg and marletta  @xcite .",
    "it is a function of the spectral parameter whose zeros correspond to eigenvalues , i.e.  a _ match_. in practice , we match at a point roughly centred at the front .",
    "further for parabolic systems it is typically analytic in the right - half complex parameter plane and the argument principle allows us to globally determine the existence of zeros and therefore unstable eigenvalues by integrating the evans function along suitably chosen contours .    the one - dimensional label of the evans function has started to be overturned and in particular deng and nii  @xcite , gesztesy , latushkin and makarov  @xcite , and gesztesy , latushkin and zumbrun  @xcite have extended the evans function theoretically to multi - dimensions . importantly from a computational perspective , humpherys and zumbrun  @xcite outlined a computational method crucial to its numerical evaluation in the multi - dimensional scenario .",
    "their method overcame a restriction on the order of the system that could be investigated numerically using shooting , in particular using exterior product spaces .",
    "it is based on continuous orhogonalization and is related to integrating along the underlying grassmannian manifold whilst evolving the coordinate representation for the grassmannian .",
    "more recently ledoux , malham and thmmler  @xcite provided an alternative ( though related ) approach to that of humpherys and zumbrun .",
    "this approach is based on chosen coordinatizations of the grassmannian manifold and integrating the resulting riccati systems .    the main idea of this paper is to determine the stability of multi - dimensional travelling waves by essentially combining the two main approaches in the natural way : we project the spectral problem transversely and shoot longitudinally .",
    "the basic details are as follows .",
    "1 .   transverse to the direction of propagation of the travelling wave we project onto a finite fourier basis .",
    "this generates a large , linear , one - dimensional system of equations for the longitudinal fourier coefficients .",
    "we construct the stable and unstable solution subspaces associated with the longitudinal far - field zero boundary conditions by integrating with given grassmannian coordinatizations ( chosen differently for each subspace ) .",
    "the evans function is the determinant of the matrix of vectors spanning both subspaces and measures their linear dependence .",
    "we evaluate it at an intermediate longitudinal point .",
    "we compare the construction of the stable and unstable solution subspaces by integrating the spectral problem using the continuous orthogonalization method of humpherys and zumbrun .",
    "we also compare these with standard projection methods that project the spectral problem onto a finite multi - dimensional basis satisfying the boundary conditions and solve the resulting large algebraic eigenvalue problem .    the parabolic nonlinear systems that we will consider here are of the form @xmath0 on the cylindrical domain @xmath1 . here",
    "@xmath2 is a vector of component fields and @xmath3 represents a nonlinear coupling reaction term .",
    "the diagonal matrix @xmath4 encodes the positive constant diffusion coefficients .",
    "we suppose we have dirichlet boundary conditions in the infinite longitudinal direction @xmath5 and periodic boundary conditions in the transverse direction @xmath6 .",
    "we assume also , that we are in a reference frame travelling in the longitudinal direction with velocity @xmath7 .",
    "though we assume only two spatial dimensions our subsequent analysis in the rest of this paper is straightforwardly extended to higher dimensional domains which are transversely periodic .",
    "we also suppose we have a travelling wave solution @xmath8 of velocity @xmath7 satisfying the boundary conditions , whose stability is the object of our scrutiny .    as a specific application we consider a cubic autocatalysis reaction - diffusion system that admits wrinkled cellular travelling fronts .",
    "they appear as solutions bifurcating from planar travelling wave solutions as the autocatalytic diffusion parameter is increased .",
    "the initiation of this first bifurcation is known as the cellular instability and has been studied in some detail in the reaction kinetics and combustion literature ; see for example horvth , petrov , scott and showalter  @xcite or terman  @xcite .",
    "however our main interest here is the stability of these cellular fronts themselves .",
    "it has been shown by direct numerical simulation of the reaction - diffusion system that the cellular fronts become unstable as the autocatalyst diffusion parameter is increased further ",
    "see for example horvth , petrov , scott and showalter  @xcite and malevanets , careta and kapral  @xcite .",
    "we apply our multi - dimensional evans function shooting method to this problem and we reveal the explicit form of the spectrum associated with such fronts .",
    "we compare our shooting methods with standard direct projection methods obtaining high accuracy concurrency .",
    "we confirm the literature on these instabilities and establish the shooting method as an effective and accurate alternative to standard direct projection methods .",
    "our paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : evans ] we review grassmannian and stiefel manifolds .",
    "we show how to construct the stable and unstable solution subspaces of the spectral problem using a given grassmannian coordinatization and define the evans function using coordinatizations for each subspace .",
    "we show how to project the spectral problem onto a finite dimensional transverse basis in detail in section  [ sec : proj ] . a large portion of numerical effort is devoted to accurately constructing the multi - dimensional fronts whose stability we wish to study , and in section  [ sec : comp ] we detail the technique we used to do this . in section  [ sec : auto ] we outline our main application  the cubic autocatalysis problem  and review the known travelling wave solutions and stability properties .",
    "we then bring to bear our full range of numerical techniques to the cubic autocatalysis problem in section  [ sec : numerics ] , comparing their accuracy . in section  [ sec : conclu ] we provide some concluding remarks and outline future directions of investigation .",

    "hence any element @xmath14 can be represented by an @xmath15 matrix of rank @xmath9 : @xmath16 the set of @xmath9 dimensional subspaces of @xmath11 forms a complex manifold @xmath17 called the _ grassmann manifold _ of @xmath9-planes in @xmath11 ; it is compact and connected ( see steenrod  @xcite or griffiths and harris  @xcite ) .",
    "there is a quotient map from @xmath12 to @xmath18 , sending each @xmath9-frame centred at the origin to the @xmath9-plane it spans  see milnor - stasheff  @xcite .",

    "each such patch is an open dense subset of @xmath18 isomorphic to @xmath29 .",
    "for example , if @xmath30 , then @xmath31 can be uniquely represented by a matrix of the form @xmath32 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 . for each @xmath28",

    "if we project this last system onto its @xmath45th and @xmath28th rows , respectively , we generate the following pair of equations for the coordinate chart variables @xmath46 and transformations @xmath47 , respectively :    @xmath48    here @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath7 and @xmath51 denote the @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 submatrices of @xmath56 , respectively .",

    "hence we can reconstruct the flow on the stiefel manifold generated by the linear vector field @xmath57 , by simply solving the riccati equation above , and then if required , subsequently integrating the linear equation for the transformations . in general , solutions to the riccati equation   can blow up",
    ". however , this is simply the manifestation of a poorly chosen local representative coordinate patch .",
    "this can be gleaned from the fact that simultaneously the determinant of @xmath47 becomes zero  afterall the linear stiefel flow , with globally smooth coefficients , does not blow up . to resolve this , we simply change patch and keep a record of the determinant of the patch swapping transformation . further details and strategies can be found in ledoux , malham and thmmler  @xcite .",
    "the continuous orthogonalization method of humpherys and zumbrun  @xcite can be thought of as the flow on the grassmann manifold corresponding to the linear vector field @xmath59 , with the coordinatization evolving according to a given unitary flow ( see ledoux , malham and thmmler  @xcite ) . indeed their method is specified by a drury  oja flow for the @xmath15 orthogonal matrix @xmath60 , together with the flow for the determinant of the matrix @xmath61 , in the @xmath62-decomposition of @xmath19 :    [ eq : do ] @xmath63    here @xmath64 denotes the hermitian transpose of @xmath60 . in practice",
    "the determinant of @xmath61 is exponentially rescaled  see humpherys and zumbrun  @xcite",
    ". we also did not find it necessary to apply any of the stabilization techniques suggested therein .",

    "we can also measure the angle between the unstable and stable linear subspaces @xmath12 and @xmath124 , see bjrck and golub  @xcite .",
    "when the columns of the matrices @xmath125 and @xmath126 which span @xmath12 and @xmath124 , respectively , are nearly linearly dependent the angle will be small .",

    "eigenvalues correspond to zeros of @xmath139 .",
    "consider the parabolic nonlinear system   posed on the cylindrical domain @xmath1 . recall that we assume dirichlet boundary conditions in the infinite longitudinal direction @xmath5 and periodic boundary conditions in the transverse direction @xmath6 ( here @xmath140 is the one - torus with period / circumference @xmath141 ) .",

    "the stability of this solution is determined by the spectrum of the linear differential operator @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the jacobian of the interaction term .",

    "to study the long - time behaviour of the wrinkled front solution we use the method of freezing travelling waves described in beyn and thmmler  @xcite and analyzed in thmmler  @xcite .",
    "this method transports the problem into a moving frame whose velocity is computed during the computation . for the travelling waves whose stability is our concern here , the freezing method has two advantages over direct simulation : firstly , we can do long - time computations of time dependent ( for example oscillating ) solutions .",
    "this is because the method picks out the correct speed for the moving frame in which the wave is roughly stationary ( in particular it does not drift out of the chosen domain ) .",
    "secondly , the freezing method can be used to obtain a suitably accurate guess for the waveform , which can then be used to initiate a newton solver that computes the travelling wave as a stationary solution in the co - moving frame . for completeness",
    "we will briefly review the idea of the freezing method here . consider a parabolic nonlinear system of form   in a stationary frame of reference : @xmath174",
    "if we substitute the ansatz @xmath175 into this equation , where @xmath176 is the unknown reference position for a wave travelling in the longitudinal @xmath177-direction , we generate the partial differential equation for @xmath59 and @xmath178 :    [ eq : pdae ] @xmath179    this constraint selects a unique solution from the one - parameter group of possible solutions generated by longitudinal translation .",
    "it is a phase condition that normalizes the system with respect to a given template function  for example a suitable choice is to set @xmath180 to be the initial data @xmath181 .",
    "hence we have generated a partial differential algebraic system  , for the unknowns @xmath182 and @xmath183 , with initial data @xmath181 and @xmath184 within the attractive set of the stable travelling wave and its velocity .",
    "a stationary solution @xmath185 of the partial differential algebraic system   represents a travelling wave solution @xmath186 with fixed speed @xmath7 to the parabolic nonlinear problem  .",
    "if the travelling wave @xmath187 is stable then the stationary solution @xmath188 is also stable and the time evolution of partial differential algebraic system   will converge to @xmath188 . thus the numerical method consists of solving the partial differential algebraic system   until the solution @xmath189 has reached the equilibrium @xmath188 .",
    "alternatively one can also solve the partial differential algebraic system   until some time @xmath190 when the solution is deemed sufficiently close to equilibrium and then use a direct method ( e.g.  newton s method ) to solve the stationary equation    [ eq : equilib ] @xmath191    for @xmath192 starting with initial values @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "as our model application we consider the cubic autocatalysis system    [ cubicautoeqns ] @xmath195    here @xmath196 is the concentration of the reactant and @xmath197 is the concentration of the autocatalyst , in the infinitely extended medium @xmath198 . in the far field , we suppose @xmath199 approaches the stable homogenenous steady state @xmath200 as @xmath201 , and the unstable homogeneous steady state @xmath202 as @xmath203 .",
    "the parameter @xmath204 is the ratio of the diffusivity of the autocatalyst to that of the reactant .",
    "this system is is globally well - posed for smooth initial data , and any finite @xmath205 .    from billingham and needham  @xcite we know that , in one spatial dimension , a unique heteroclinic connection between the unstable and stable homogeneous steady states exists for wavespeeds @xmath206 .",
    "the unique travelling wave for @xmath207 converges exponentially to the homogeneous steady states .",
    "they are readily constructed by shooting ( see for example balmforth , craster and malham  @xcite ) and represent the planar front solution referred to hereafter .",
    "it is well known that these planar travelling wave solutions become unstable to transverse perturbations when @xmath204 is greater than a critical ratio @xmath208 ( from malevanets , careta and kapral  @xcite ) , and our transverse domain is sufficiently large .",
    "this is known as the cellular instability ",
    "see for example terman  @xcite , horvth , petrov , scott and showalter  @xcite and malevanets , careta and kapral  @xcite",
    ". calculating the spectrum that reveals the mechanism of the instability is also straightforward . if we consider small perturbations about the underlying planar travelling wave solution of the form @xmath209 , for any @xmath210 , then the associated linear operator @xmath211 whose spectrum we wish to determine has the form @xmath212 the spectrum of @xmath211 consists of the pure - point spectrum , i.e.  isolated eigenvalues of finite multiplicity , together with the essential spectrum . by a result of henry",
    "@xcite , if we consider @xmath211 as an operator on the space of square integrable functions , we know that the essential spectrum is contained within the parabolic curves of the continuous spectrum in left - half complex plane .",
    "the continuous spectrum for this model problem is given for all @xmath213 and each fixed @xmath210 , by the locus in the complex @xmath66-plane of the curves @xmath214 where the last curve appears with multiplicity two .",
    "hence the continuous spectrum touches the imaginary axis at the origin when @xmath215 is zero .",
    "the origin is a simple eigenvalue for @xmath211 due to translational invariance of the underlying travelling wave @xmath216 in the longitudinal direction .",
    "thus , even though the essential spectrum does not affect linear stability , we can not automatically deduce asymptotic stability unless we consider a gently weighted space of square integrable functions , which will shift the essential spectrum to the left .",
    "we now notice that the spectral problem for the linear differential operator @xmath211 is fourth order and one - dimensional , the transverse perturbation information is encoded though the transverse wavenumber parameter @xmath215 .",
    "hence we can employ the evans function shooting approach , in particular in figure  [ dispersion ] we plot the dispersion relation for planar fronts corresponding to different values of the physical parameter @xmath204 .",
    "the dispersion relation gives the relationship between the real part of the exponential growth factor of small perturbations , @xmath217 , and transverse wave number @xmath215 ( in fact to make comparisons later easier we have used @xmath218 on the abscissa ) . to construct the graph shown ,",
    "we locate zeros of the evans function on the real @xmath66 axis and follow them as the transverse wave number @xmath215 is varied .",
    "we see in figure  [ dispersion ] that the interval @xmath219 of unstable transverse wavenumbers @xmath215 increases as @xmath204 increases ( at least up to @xmath220 ) .",
    "the wavenumber where the maximum of @xmath217 occurs has largest growth and is thus typically the transverse mode expressed in the dynamics .    .",
    "for @xmath221 , all perturbations decay and the planar front is linearly stable , but for the other values of  @xmath204 there is a growing interval @xmath219 of unstable transverse wavenumbers . ]",
    "however our real concern here is the stability of the wrinkled cellular fronts themselves as we increase the diffusion ratio parameter @xmath204 beyond @xmath222 .",
    "we know the planar waves are unstable in this regime and the question is whether the bifurcating wrinkled cellular fronts are stable for values of @xmath204 just beyond @xmath222 but do become unstable at another critical value of @xmath204 . using direct simulations of the reaction - diffusion system malevanets , careta and kapral  @xcite demonstrated that when @xmath220 the transverse structure of the propagating fronts was very complex with spatio - temporal dynamics of its own .",
    "our goal is to elicit in practice the initial mechanisms that precipitate the behaviour they observe through a careful study of the spectra of the underlying multi - dimensional travelling fronts .",
    "we will compute the spectrum of the two - dimensional travelling front by computing the evans function associated with the linear operator  @xmath223 defined in  .",
    "first , we compute the front with the freezing method as explained in section  [ sec : comp ] . then as in section  [ sec : proj ]",
    ", we project the problem onto a finite number of transverse fourier modes @xmath224 .",
    "this generates the large linear system   which is of the standard linear form   where the coefficient matrix is given by @xmath225 where the matrices @xmath226 and @xmath227 are explicitly given at the end of section  [ sec : proj ] .",
    "this coefficient matrix depends on both the travelling wave solution  @xmath187 and the spectral parameter  @xmath66 .",
    "it also depends on the nonlinear reaction term . for our autocatalytic problem the jacobian @xmath143 of the nonlinear reaction term and its fourier transform @xmath228",
    "are given by @xmath229 where @xmath230 and @xmath231 are the fourier transforms of  @xmath47 and  @xmath232 respectively , and @xmath233 denotes the convolution defined by @xmath234 .",

    "we use the coordinate patch identified by @xmath114 where @xmath237 for the interval @xmath238 $ ] . on this interval",
    "we solve the riccati equation   for @xmath101 ; with the chosen coordinate patch , the coefficient matrices in the riccati equation are @xmath239 , @xmath240 , @xmath241 and @xmath242 .",

    "further , the respective coordinate patches for the left and right intervals , and matching point @xmath235 , are chosen to avoid singularities in the riccati flows in these intervals ( in all our calculations for the autocatalysis problem we were always able to find such a matching point when using these two patches ) .",
    "hence we evaluate the evans function by computing the determinant  .",
    "this information is used to find the spectrum of the travelling wave .",
    "we first consider planar travelling waves .",
    "this will not give us new information but it is a good test for our procedure .",
    "the travelling waves can be found by the freezing method , but also by the shooting method explained in balmforth , craster and malham  @xcite for the one - dimensional case .",
    "the next step is to find the unstable subspace of   at @xmath94 .",
    "the travelling wave  @xmath187 is planar and thus independent of  @xmath257 , so the fourier coefficient  @xmath258 vanishes for @xmath259 .",
    "this implies that the differential equation   decouples in @xmath260 systems , one for every  @xmath261 , each of the form @xmath262 for the autocatalytic system  ( [ cubicautoeqns ] ) , this becomes @xmath263 we have @xmath264 in the limit @xmath265 .",
    "the coefficient matrix in   has two unstable eigenvectors when @xmath66 is to the right of the continuous spectrum , and these eigenvectors are    [ norm1 ] @xmath266    these eigenvectors are all analytic functions of  @xmath66 except at those points where either @xmath267 or one of the expressions under the square root sign vanishes .",
    "a small calculation shows that the latter can only happen when @xmath66 is on the negative real axis , so it will not interfere with stability computations , which concern eigenvalues with positive real part .",
    "in contrast , we may have @xmath268 for positive @xmath66 , but in the situations considered here @xmath267 vanishes only for values of @xmath66 which are so large that they do not concern us here .",
    "alternatively , the singularities caused by @xmath268 can easily be avoided by using @xmath269 as eigenvector instead of @xmath270 .",
    "we thus have two unstable directions for every wavenumber  @xmath215 . together",
    "these form the @xmath271-dimensional unstable subspace @xmath86 at @xmath94 . using this ,",
    "as described in section  [ sec : method ] above , we integrate the riccati equation   from @xmath272 to @xmath273 , where @xmath254 corresponds to a position sufficiently far behind the front .",

    "oja approach due to humpherys and zumbrun  @xcite is very similar .",
    "the difference is that it uses the drury ",
    "oja flow   to propagate the subspaces and   to evaluate the evans function .    .",
    "the fourier cut - off is @xmath281 and the transversal length of the domain is @xmath282 .",

    "we see that the evans function has a zero at @xmath284 and double zeros around @xmath285 , @xmath286 and @xmath287 .",
    "the zero at @xmath284 corresponds to the eigenvalue at the origin caused by translational symmetry .",
    "the other zeros correspond to double eigenvalues .",
    "they have positive real part and thus we can conclude that the planar wave is unstable for @xmath283coinciding with the long - established statements in section  [ sec : auto ] .",
    "in fact , the zeros for the evans function can be related to the dispersion curve in figure  [ dispersion ] .",
    "as mentioned above , the differential equation   decouples into @xmath260 subsystems of the form  , each corresponding to the linear operator  @xmath211 given in   for a particular wave number .",
    "the basis vectors we chose for the unstable subspace are zero for all but one of these subsystems .",
    "since the subsystems are decoupled , the solution at @xmath273 is also zero for all but one of these subsystems .",
    "thus , the matrix @xmath288 at the matching point is ( after reordering ) a block - diagonal matrix consisting of @xmath260 four - by - four blocks , and its determinant is the product of the determinants of the @xmath289 blocks .",
    "however , every determinant of a sub - block is the evans function  @xmath290 of the operator   for a particular wave number  @xmath215 .",
    "thus , the evans function for the two - dimensional planar wave is the product of the evans functions for the one - dimensional wave with respect to transverse perturbations : @xmath291 we chose @xmath282 , so @xmath292 corresponds to a wave number of @xmath293 in figure  [ dispersion ] .",
    "the plot shows that the corresponding growth rate is approximately 0.0005 , thus @xmath294 has a zero around @xmath295 .",
    "the dispersion relation is symmetric , so @xmath296 has a zero at the same value .",
    "this explains why the two - dimensional evans function has a double zero around @xmath297 .",

    "the scale of the evans function between the zeros , which depends on the normalization of the eigenvectors   and  , is of lesser relevance in this context .",
    "however for completeness , we address this issue in section  [ sec : convergence ] .",
    "having established that our method works for planar fronts , we now turn to the wrinkled front .",
    "the most immediate problem is that of computing reliable steady wrinkled fronts .",
    "the procedure we used to do this is outlined as follows :    * the partial differential algebraic system   is solved on the computational domain @xmath303 \\times [ -60,60]$ ] with a second - order finite element method on a grid of right triangles formed by dividing a grid of @xmath304 rectangles along their diagonals .",

    "oja approach .",
    "the front  @xmath187 is determined as explained above , with interpolation being used for those points that fall between the grid points of the finite element solution .",

    "the domain is @xmath303\\times[-60,60]$ ] and as matching point we have chosen @xmath116 which is roughly the front location ( see figure  [ front ] ) .",
    "both approaches produce evans functions with zeros at ( approximately ) the same @xmath66-values : there is one eigenvalue with a positive real part around @xmath308 , a double zero around @xmath309 ( due to translation invariance ) , and pairs of eigenvalues around  @xmath310 and  @xmath311 .",
    "in particular , the eigenvalue around  @xmath308 shows that the wrinkled front is unstable for @xmath312 .",
    "however , the riccati and drury  oja approaches do differ in some respects .",
    "the riccati approach involves integrating a system of half the dimension as compared to the drury ",
    "oja approach , so we can expect it to be faster , especially for large values of @xmath156 ( in comparable experiments for large @xmath156 , it was typically two to three times faster ) .",

    "the largest computation we performed is with @xmath314 , in which case the one - dimensional equation has order  @xmath315 .",
    "we also computed the eigenvalues by a projection method to check these results .",
    "the comsol package , which we used to compute the travelling front , has an eigenvalue solver based on the arnoldi method as implemented in arpack  @xcite .",
    "this solver uses a shift  @xmath316 to allow the user to choose on which part of the spectrum to concentrate .",
    "we found that the choice of this shift is not straightforward .",
    "it is unwise to use a shift which is exactly an eigenvalue , so in particular , the default value of @xmath317 should not be used .",

    "the resulting eigenvalues are also listed in table  [ evanstable ] .",
    "they are in close agreement with the eigenvalues found using the evans function , giving additional confidence in our computation .    .",
    "this plot uses a @xmath320 grid in the depicted region of the complex plane .",

    "figure  [ evansw3cp ] shows the contours where the real and imaginary parts are zero ; eigenvalues correspond with the intersections of these contours .",
    "all eigenvalues are real .",
    "interestingly , the contours are well separated on the boundary of the depicted region of the complex plane even though the eigenvalues are packed closely together .",

    "the evans function no longer has a zero with positive real part , meaning that there are no unstable eigenvalues .",
    "hence for this value of @xmath204 the wrinkled front is in fact stable .",
    "we have thus established the following overall stability scenario for travelling wave solutions of the cubic autocatalysis problem .",
    "when @xmath204 is less than @xmath208 planar travelling waves are stable to transverse perturbations .",
    "for @xmath204 beyond this instability there exist wrinkled fronts that are stable for @xmath321 .",
    "however for @xmath283 these wrinkled fronts themselves become unstable .",
    "these stability results may depend on the transverse domain size ( which we fixed at @xmath322 ) ; see horvth , petrov , scott and showalter  @xcite .",
    "if one is only interested in the stability of the underlying front then several methods exist to detect eigenvalues in the right - half complex spectral parameter plane  which also require relatively few evans function evaluations .",
    "one important method uses the argument principle .",
    "we have the following sectorial estimate for the spectrum of @xmath211 : if @xmath323 then    [ eq : sectorial ] @xmath324    where @xmath325we provide a proof in appendix  [ app : sectorial ] .",
    "hence we can restrict our search for unstable eigenvalues to the region of the complex @xmath66-plane bounded by these inequalities .    in our case",
    ", we have @xmath326 and @xmath327 for @xmath328 , and @xmath329 and @xmath330 for @xmath312 .",
    "so , the above estimate implies that any eigenvalue  @xmath66 satisfies @xmath331 and @xmath332 .",
    "any unstable eigenvalue is thus inside the contour bounded by these lines and the imaginary axis ; this contour is depicted in the left part of figure  [ contour ] ( the small semi - circle around the origin is to exclude the double eigenvalue at the origin , as explained below ) . the evans function is analytic inside this contour , and thus we can count the number of zeros inside the contour by computing the change of the argument of the evans function as @xmath66 goes around the contour .",
    "this suggests the following method .",
    "we divide the contour  @xmath333 in small segments , compute the evans functions at the end points of the segments , find the change in the argument over each section and sum these to find the total change over the whole contour .",
    "the number of zeros is then the change of the argument divided by  @xmath334 .",
    "the segments in which the contour is divided have to be chosen small enough that the change of the argument over each segment is smaller than  @xmath335 .",
    "adaptive procedures to achieve this have been proposed by , amongst others , ying and katz  @xcite , but for simplicity we determined the partition of the contour by trial and error .",
    "the evans function , with our choice of initial conditions , satisfies @xmath336 .",
    "hence , it suffices to transverse half the contour  @xmath333 .",
    "the plot at the right of figure  [ contour ] shows how the argument of  @xmath79 changes as @xmath66 transverses the top half of the contour .",
    "we see that the change over the whole contour is  @xmath337 , and thus there is one zero inside the contour .",
    "this is the zero around @xmath338 shown in figure  [ evansw3qr ] ; there are no other unstable eigenvalues .",
    "the operator  @xmath211 is invariant under translations and hence it has two eigenvalues at @xmath284 .",
    "thus , the evans function is zero at @xmath284 and its argument is undefined .",
    "for this reason , the contour  @xmath333 includes a small semi - circle of radius  @xmath339 to avoid the origin .",
    "it is of course possible that we miss some eigenvalues because of this deformation . to guard against this",
    ", we also compute the change in the argument of  @xmath79 as @xmath66  transverses a circle around the origin with radius  @xmath339 .",
    "we find that the argument changes by  @xmath340 and hence the evans function has two zeros inside the circle .",
    "this shows that we have not missed any eigenvalues by the deformation of  @xmath333 around the origin .",
    "another method is the parity - index argument ( which we have not investigated here , but we include a description for completeness ) . to determine if there are eigenvalues on the positive real axis , we could use that @xmath341 as @xmath342 , as we prove in appendix  [ app : largelam ] .",
    "a change in sign of the evans function along the real axis indicates an unstable eigenvalue .",
    "this can be exposed by comparing the sign of the evans function in the asymptotic limit @xmath342 to its sign elsewhere on the positive real axis , or the derivative or second derivative of the evans function along the real axis evaluated at the origin .",
    "note that to implement this technique we need to ensure the evans function evaluated in the neighbourhood of the origin and that generating the asymptotic limit have been normalized , as far as their sign is concerned , in the same way .",
    "this may require keeping careful track of the the non - zero analytic multiples dropped in our definition of the modified evans function , i.e.  the normalization of the initial data , the scalar exponential factor and the determinants of @xmath100 and @xmath343 ( which can be computed analytically in the asymptotic limit also ) .",
    "the results reported in table  [ evanstable ] show that the values of  @xmath66 for which the evans function  @xmath79 is zero converge as @xmath344 .",
    "however they do not show how the evans function scales for other values of @xmath66 ( not in the spectrum ) as @xmath156 becomes large .",
    "we see in figure  [ evansp3 ] for the planar front , that in the domain of interest with @xmath66 of order @xmath339 , the evans function computed using the drury ",
    "oja approach with @xmath281 , is of order @xmath302 .",
    "similarly , for the wrinkled front , we see in figures  [ evansw3qr ] and  [ evansw2.5qr ] , also computed using the drury ",
    "oja approach with @xmath307 , the scale of the evans function is of order @xmath345 for @xmath66 of order @xmath339 .",
    "these small results we find for the evans function  far smaller than machine precision ",
    "suggest that the computation might be inaccurate because of round - off error .",
    "this is not the case here .",
    "the solution of the drury ",
    "oja equation   does not contain such small numbers .",
    "they only appear when the determinant is computed at the matching point , which is a stable computation ; see for example higham  @xcite .",
    "the determinant is computed by performing an lu - decomposition with partial pivoting and then multiplying the diagonal entries .",
    "both steps are numerically stable even though the final result may be very small ( as long as it does not underflow ) .",
    "the factorization   for the planar front provides another view point : the evans function for @xmath281 is the product of @xmath346 one - dimensional evans functions , and if each of them is 0.06not a very small number  then their product is of the order  @xmath302 , which is a very small number .    for the modified evans",
    "function we construct using the riccati approach , we see in figure  [ evansw3ric ] , that in the domain of interest , it is of order @xmath275 when @xmath307 . if we reproduce figure  [ evansw3ric ] for increasing values of @xmath156 , we find that the modified evans function actually grows . for large @xmath156",
    ", it increases roughly by a factor of @xmath347 per unit increase in @xmath156 .",
    "however it is important to emphasize that the solutions to the riccati systems , that are used to construct the modified evans function , remain bounded .",
    "it is only when we evaluate the determinant , that for example when @xmath348 , the scale of the modified evans function in figure  [ evansw3ric ] is of order @xmath349 .",
    "hence the question of the scaling of the evans function comes into play in the multi - dimensional context .    in the one - dimensional case ,",
    "the standard definition of the evans function is   given in alexander , gardner and jones  @xcite .",
    "of course this definition stands modulo any analytic non - zero multiplicative factor  afterall it s the zeros of the evans function we are typically after . a different appropriate normalization of the initial data @xmath350 rescales the evans function by such a factor .",
    "further it is common to drop the scalar exponential factor .",
    "hence for example the difference between the humpherys and zumbrun evans function   and the standard evans function is that the scalar exponential factor is dropped and the initial data might be normalized differently when it is @xmath62-factorized . for the modified evans function in  , we dropped the exponential factor and also the determinants of some full rank submatrices in the determinant of the standard evans function .",
    "however such analytic non - zero factors impact the scale of the evans function in the multi - dimensional context , as they depend on @xmath156 .",
    "this can lead to growth or decay of the evans function employed away from the eigenvalues as @xmath156 is increased , depending on which factors are kept and which are dropped .",
    "this is precisely what we have observed for the drury  oja and riccati approaches , which decay and grow , respectively , as @xmath156 increases .",
    "gesztesy , latushkin and zumbrun  @xcite show that the evans function , when suitably normalized , coincides with the 2-modified fredholm determinant of a certain operator related to @xmath211 .",
    "importantly , the 2-modified fredholm determinant converges as @xmath344 .",
    "they treat the self - adjoint case ; the non - self - adjoint operator @xmath211 we consider can , using suitable exponential weight functions , be transformed into a self - adjoint one ( numerically though this is not necessary and could introduce further complications due to the introduction of exponential factors in the potential term ) .",
    "gesztesy , latushkin and zumbrun define the evans function much like we have , through a galerkin approximation , using the matching condition  .",
    "their normalization , natural to their context , involves ensuring the evans function does not depend on the coordinate system chosen and is invariant to similarity transformations ( see gesztesy , latushkin and makarov  @xcite ) .",
    "crucially , gesztesy , latushkin and zumbrun demonstrate in theorem  4.15 that their 2-modified fredholm determinant equals the evans function multiplied by an exponential factor ( nonzero and analytic ) , whose exponent diverges as @xmath344 ( it can diverge to positive or negative infinity depending on the precise form of the coefficient matrix @xmath351 ) .",
    "hence their evans function diverges as well .",
    "consequently , the 2-modified fredholm determinant is a natural candidate for the canonical evans function .    with this in mind ,",
    "our observation regarding the measured divergence of the modified and humpherys and zumbrun evans functions in our experiments , is not too surprising .",
    "their divergence , the modified evans function to large values , and the humpherys and zumbrun evans function to small values , is simply a reflection of the over / under estimate of the crucial , correct multiplicative exponential factor that equates these evans functions with the 2-modified fredholm determinant of gesztesy , latushkin and zumbrun , which guarantees a finite limit as @xmath344",
    ". it would be interesting to see whether one can explicitly compute the factor relating the evans function of gesztesy , latushkin and makarov and the evans function , as defined in this paper .",
    "our goal in this paper was to show , for the first time , that spectral shooting methods can be extended to study the stability of genuinely multi - dimensional travelling fronts .",
    "it was already obvious to the people working in this field that this can be done by a fourier decomposition in the transverse dimension , thus reducing the problem to a large one - dimensional problem ; however , no - one had yet managed to tackle the resulting large one - dimensional problems .",
    "this issue was overcome in theory by the work of humpherys and zumbrun  @xcite and latterly that of ledoux , malham and thmmler  @xcite , which showed that enough information for matching can be retained by integrating along the natural underlying grassmannian manifolds ( though these ideas have been well known in the control theory and quantum chemistry for a long while ",
    "see for example hermann and martin  @xcite and johnson  @xcite ) .",
    "the dimension of the grassmannian manifolds scale with the square of the order of the original problem .",
    "these methods brought the possibility of multi - dimensional shooting within our grasp , but there were still challenges to be overcome .",
    "we have addressed the most immediate of these in this paper :    1 .   how to project the problem onto the finite transverse fourier basis and ensure a",
    "numerically well - posed large system of linear ordinary differential spectral equations ; 2 .",
    "how to construct the genuinely multi - dimensional fronts , this was a particular challenge which we managed to overcome using the combined techniques of freezing and parameter continuation ( the latter for the unstable multi - dimensional fronts ) ; 3 .",
    "choose a non - trivial but well - known example problem , which exhibits the development of planar front instabilities ( an important initial testing ground for us ) but also two - dimensional wrinkled fronts that themselves became unstable as a physical parameter was varied ; 4 .",
    "apply the humpherys and zumbrun continuous orthogonalization as well as the riccati methods to study the stability of the wrinkled fronts , in particular integrating a large system of order @xmath315using @xmath281 transverse modes ",
    "hitherto the largest system considered in evans function calculations was of order @xmath352 ( see allen and bridges  @xcite ) .",
    "5 .   ultimately demonstrating the _ feasibility _ , _ accuracy _ , _ numerical convergence _ and _ robustness _ of multi - dimensional shooting to determine eigenvalues .",
    "however there is still more to do .",
    "though multi - dimensional shooting is competitive in terms of accuracy , how does it compare in terms of computational cost ?",
    "there are multiple sources of error including : approximation of the underlying wrinkled front , domain truncation , transverse fourier subspace finite projection , approximation of the solution to the projected one - dimensional spectral equations and the matching position .",
    "our experience is that the accuracy of the underlying wrinkled front is especially important .",
    "although we have endeavoured to keep all these errors small , not only for additional confidence in our numerical results , but also for optimal efficiency , we would like to know the relative influence of each one of these sources of error in order to target our computational effort more effectively .",
    "finally we would also like to see how the method transfers to hyperbolic travelling waves and more complicated mixed partial differential systems .",
    "sjam attended a workshop at aim in palo alto in may 2005 on `` stability criteria for multi - dimensional waves and patterns '' organised by chris jones , yuri latushkin , bob pego , bjrn sandstede and arnd scheel that instigated this work .",
    "the authors would like to thank marcel oliver for his invaluable advice and help at the beginning of this project and also gabriel lord , tom bridges , bjrn sandstede and jacques vanneste for useful discussions .",
    "a large part of this work was conceived and computed while all four authors were visiting the isaac newton institute in the spring of 2007 .",
    "we would like to thank arieh iserles and ernst hairer for inviting us and providing so much support and enthusiasm .",
    "lastly we would like to thank the anonymous referees whose helpful comments and suggestions markedly improved the overall presentation of the paper .",
    "we follow the standard arguments that prove that the parabolic linear operator @xmath353 is sectorial , see for example brin  @xcite . first consider the @xmath354 complex inner product with the spectral problem @xmath355 premultiplying this spectral equation with @xmath356 , and integrating over the domain @xmath1 , we get @xmath357 in this last equation , if we set @xmath358 where @xmath359 , we get @xmath360 if we consider the complex conjugate transpose of the spectral equation , postmultiply with @xmath2 , and integrate over the domain @xmath1 , we get @xmath361 if we now add these last two equations then we get @xmath362 now dividing through by @xmath363 we get     next consider taking the imaginary part of followed by the absolute value on both sides and using hlder s inequality to get @xmath364 adding inequalities and and using that @xmath365 , where @xmath325 , and the arithmetic - geometric mean inequality @xmath366 we get  after dividing through by @xmath363 .",
    "we follow the arguments for such results given in alexander , gardner and jones  @xcite and sandstede  @xcite .",
    "we begin by rescaling @xmath367 in for each @xmath158 and taking the limit @xmath368 to get @xmath369 hence we have a decoupled system of @xmath260 equations of the form @xmath370 where @xmath371 .",
