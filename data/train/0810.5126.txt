    "a wide variety of cosmological observations seem to point to a two - component dark sector , in which approximately 73% of the energy density of the universe is in dark energy and 23% is in non - baryonic dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "ordinary matter constitutes the remaining 4% @xcite .",
    "the physics of the dark matter sector is plausibly quite minimal : an excellent fit to the data is obtained by assuming that dark matter is a cold , collisionless relic , with only the relic abundance as a free parameter . the well - known `` wimp miracle '' @xcite is the fact that a stable , neutral particle with weak - scale mass and coupling naturally provides a reasonable energy density in dm .",
    "particles of this type arise in models of low - scale supersymmetry @xcite or large extra dimensions @xcite , and provide compelling dm candidates . in the contemporary universe , they would be collisionless as far as any conceivable dynamical effects are concerned .",
    "nevertheless , it is also possible to imagine a rich phenomenology within the dark sector .",
    "the dark matter could be coupled to a relatively strong short - range force that could have interesting consequences for structure on small scales @xcite .",
    "alternatively , dm could also be weakly coupled to long - range forces , which might be related to dark energy @xcite .",
    "one difficulty with the latter is that such forces are typically mediated by scalar fields , and it is very hard to construct natural models in which the scalar field remains massless ( to provide a long - range force ) while interacting with the dm at an interesting strength .    in this paper , we explore the possibility of a long - range _ gauge _ force coupled to dm , in the form of a new unbroken abelian field , dubbed the @xmath3 `` dark photon . ''",
    "we imagine that this new gauge boson @xmath4 couples to a dm fermion @xmath5 , but not directly to any standard model ( sm ) fields .",
    "our model is effectively parameterized by only two numbers : @xmath6 , the mass of the dm , and @xmath1 , the dark fine - structure constant .",
    "if @xmath6 is sufficiently large and @xmath1 is sufficiently small , annihilations of dm particles through the new force freeze out in the early universe and are negligible today , despite there being equal numbers of positively- and negatively - charged particles .",
    "the dark matter in our model is therefore a plasma , which could conceivably lead to interesting collective effects in the dm dynamics .",
    "remarkably , the allowed values of @xmath6 and @xmath1 seem quite reasonable .",
    "we find that the most relevant constraint comes from demanding that accumulated soft scatterings do not appreciably perturb the motion of dm particles in a galaxy over the lifetime of the universe , which can be satisfied by @xmath7 and @xmath8  tev .",
    "for values near these bounds , the alterations in dm halo shapes may in fact lead to closer agreement with observation @xcite .",
    "however , for such regions of parameter space , if @xmath3 were the only interaction felt by the @xmath5 particles , the resulting relic abundances would be slightly too large , so we need to invoke an additional annihilation channel .",
    "we show that @xmath5 can in fact be a wimp , possessing @xmath9 quantum numbers in addition to @xmath3 charge .",
    "such a model provides the correct relic abundance , and is consistent with particle - physics constraints so long as the mixing between ordinary photons and dark photons is sufficiently small .",
    "we consider a number of other possible observational limits on dark electromagnetism , and show that they do not appreciably constrain the parameter space .",
    "since the dm halo is overall neutral under @xmath3 , there is no net long - range force that violates the equivalence principle .",
    "although there are new light degrees of freedom , their temperature is naturally lower than that of the sm plasma , thereby avoiding constraints from big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "energy loss through dark bremsstrahlung radiation is less important than the soft - scattering effects already mentioned .",
    "the coupling of dm to the dark radiation background can in principle suppress the growth of structure on small scales , but we show that the dm decouples from the dark radiation at an extremely high redshift . on the other hand , we find that there are plasma instabilities ( _ e.g. _  the weibel instability ) that can potentially play an important role in the assembly of galactic halos ; however , a detailed analysis of these effects is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the idea of an unbroken @xmath0 coupled to dark matter is not new .",

    "@xcite considered several models for a hidden dark sector , including one manifestation in which the dark matter consists of heavy hidden - sector staus interacting via a copy of electromagnetism .",

    "we then consider the bounds on the new dark parameters from successful thermal production of sufficient quantities of dark matter as well as requiring that bbn and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) predictions remain unchanged .",
    "the restrictions of parameter space are closely related to those resulting from standard short - range wimp dark matter . in section  [ sec : galacticdynamics ] , we consider the effect of long range interactions on dm particle interactions in the halos of galaxies . by requiring that our model not deviate too greatly from the predictions of collisionless dm",
    ", we find that the allowed regions of @xmath10 parameter space from section  [ sec : earlyuniverse ] are essentially excluded . in order to evade these constraints ,",

    "additional effects of dark radiation are presented in section  [ sec : newlimits ] , and we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we note that our model does not address the hierarchy problem , nor provide a high - energy completion to the sm",
    ". however , new gauge groups and hidden sectors may be generic results of many such high - energy theories ( _ e.g. _  string and grand unified theories ) , and a wimp coupled to an unbroken @xmath0 is certainly a plausible low - energy manifestation of such theories .",
    "the most important lesson of our model is that interesting physics might be lurking in the dark sector , and it is worthwhile to consider a variety of possible models and explore their consequences for astrophysics and particle physics .",
    "we postulate a new `` dark '' abelian gauge group @xmath3 with gauge coupling constant @xmath11 and dark fine - structure constant @xmath12 . in the simplest case , the dark matter sector consists of a single particle @xmath5 with @xmath3 charge of @xmath13 and mass @xmath6 along with its antiparticle @xmath14 . for definiteness , we take @xmath5 to be a fermion , though our results are applicable to scalars as well . as",
    "the limits on new long range forces on sm fields are very stringent , we assume that all the sm fields are neutral under @xmath3 . for the moment we take the @xmath5 field to be a singlet under @xmath15 , a restriction that will be relaxed in section  [ sec : su2 ] . as a result , this extension of the sm is anomaly free . in this section , we will derive constraints on the mass @xmath6 and coupling @xmath16 from the evolution of dark matter in the early universe .",
    "two considerations drive these constraints : the dark matter must provide the right relic abundance at thermal freeze - out , and the dark radiation from the @xmath3 can not contribute too greatly to relativistic degrees of freedom at bbn ( a similar bound coming from the cmb also applies but is weaker ) .",
    "the degrees of freedom in the dark sector are thus the heavy dm fermions @xmath5 and massless dark photons @xmath17 .",
    "the lagrangian for the dark sector is @xmath18 here @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the field - strength tensor for the dark photons .",
    "we assume that the mixing term @xmath21 is set to zero at some high scale ( say the gut scale ) .",
    "this is a self - consistent choice , since if there is no mixing between the dark and visible sectors , @xmath22 is preserved by the renormalization group evolution .",
    "( in section  [ sec : su2 ] we argue that mixing is not generated by radiative corrections even when @xmath5 carries @xmath9 quantum numbers . )",
    "this choice allows us to bypass constraints on a new @xmath0 coming from mixing between the photon and dark photon , that is , ` paraphotons ' @xcite .",
    "we have no _ a priori _ assumptions on the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath16 , though as we shall see , it suffices to think of the former as @xmath23 and the latter @xmath24 .",
    "we now follow the thermal history of the dark sector .",
    "our analysis follows that of ref .",
    "@xcite ; we rehearse it in a slightly simpler context here to illustrate how the results depend on our various assumptions . if the visible sector and the dark sector are decoupled from each other , they may have different temperatures , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively ; rapid interactions between them would equilibrate these two values .",
    "after inflation , the two sectors could conceivably reheat to different temperatures , depending on the coupling of the inflaton to the various fields .",
    "even if the temperatures are initially equal , once the two sectors decouple as the universe expands and cools , entropy deposited from frozen - out degrees of freedom in one sector will generally prevent the dark temperature @xmath27 from tracking the visible sector temperature @xmath25 .",
    "the ratio @xmath28 will depend on the spectrum of both sectors , and is itself a function of @xmath25 .",
    "as the temperature drops below a particle s mass , the associated degrees of freedom freeze out and dump entropy into their respective sectors ( dark or visible ) .",
    "this causes the temperature of that sector to decline more slowly than @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the scale factor of the universe . as the entropy density @xmath31 of the visible sector and @xmath32 of the dark sector",
    "are individually conserved after decoupling , we must separately count the degrees of freedom in these two sectors .",
    "there are two definitions of degrees of freedom of interest to us : @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the former is defined as @xmath35 and is used in calculation of the total relativistic energy density , @xmath36 . here",
    "@xmath37 is the number of degree of freedom for particle species @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the temperature of the thermal bath of species @xmath38 , and @xmath25 is the temperature of the photon bath .",
    "the sums run over all active degrees of freedom at temperature @xmath25 . separating out the visible fields , @xmath33 can be written as @xmath40 where the sums now run over the dark particles .",
    "if we restrict the visible sector to the sm , then the term @xmath41 is @xmath42 above the top mass , dropping gradually to @xmath43 at @xmath44",
    ". between @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and drops again to @xmath47 in the present day .",
    "( see _ e.g. _  ref .",
    "@xcite for more detail . )",
    "similarly , the total entropy density @xmath48 ( a conserved quantity ) at a photon temperature @xmath25 is proportional to @xmath49 , where @xmath50 prior to neutrino decoupling , all the relativistic standard model degrees of freedom are in thermal equilibrium at a common temperature .",
    "thus , before @xmath51  mev when neutrinos decouple , we have @xmath52 .",
    "furthermore , we may split the dark @xmath34 into heavy and light degrees of freedom : @xmath53 and @xmath54 , where the heavy degrees of freedom are non - relativistic at bbn .",
    "we are interested in the number of degrees of freedom at bbn ( @xmath51  mev ) because formation of the experimentally observed ratios of nuclei are very sensitive to the expansion of the universe at that time , which is related to the energy density of radiation through the friedmann equation . from this ,",

    "the number of degrees of freedom that contribute to the entropy density today , @xmath238 , is of order unity .",

    "however , there may be collective plasma effects that affect dm dynamics on timescales much shorter than those due to two - body interactions .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to state with confidence what the observational consequences of those effects will actually be , even if they are relevant . given theoretical uncertainties about the nonlinear evolution of such instabilities , we leave the detailed implications to future work .    as a simple example we consider the weibel instability @xcite , an exponential magnetic - field amplification that arises if the plasma particles have an anisotropic velocity distribution .",
    "such anisotropies could arise , for example , during hierarchical structure formation as subhalos merge to form more massive halos .",
    "similar instabilities in the baryonic gas have been postulated to account for the magnetic fields in galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "the growth rate @xmath79 of the magnetic field is @xmath239 where @xmath240 is the plasma frequency , @xmath241 is the dark - matter density , and @xmath77 is the velocity of the dark matter within the colliding halos . assuming @xmath242 , we find @xmath243    to be relevant for galactic - halo formation , the timescale @xmath244 for magnetic - field amplification should be shorter than the dynamical timescale @xmath117 of the merging subhalos .",
    "the instability will be therefore be of interest when @xmath245 this range of @xmath16 and @xmath6 encompasses the entire parameter space of interest for any reasonable value of @xmath117 .",
    "therefore , we suspect that galactic structure will be affected by plasma effects in the dark matter due to the @xmath3 even when @xmath16 is not near the boundary of allowed values from soft scattering .",
    "one possibility is that nonlinear evolution would result in a strongly magnetized plasma , and if so , dark matter would be effectively collisional and thus probably inconsistent with data .",
    "however , theory and simulations that study the nonlinear evolution of the weibel instability for relativistic pair plasmas and nonrelativistic electron - proton plasmas do not yet agree whether the magnetic fields survive , and simulations for the equal - mass nonrelativistic plasma we are considering have not been performed .",
    "it is therefore premature to conclude that these instabilities will result in effectively collisional dark matter ; a more detailed study will be required to assess these effects .",
    "given how little direct information we have about the nature of dark matter , it is of crucial importance to explore models in which the dm sector has an interesting phenomenology of its own . in many ways ,",
    "an unbroken @xmath0 gauge field coupled to dark matter is a natural way to obtain a long - range interaction between dm particles .",
    "in contrast to the case of hypothetical long - range scalar fields , the masslessness of the gauge field is protected by a symmetry , and the absence of long - range violations of the equivalence principle is naturally explained by the overall charge neutrality of the dark plasma .",
    "new unbroken @xmath0 s can appear naturally in unified models .",
    "while a dark @xmath0 may be realized as a broken symmetry with massive vector bosons , it has been pointed out that there are few constraints on the massless , unbroken case from the early universe .",
    "we have verified that the minimal model , with just a single massive dirac fermion for the dark matter and a massless dark photon , is consistent with limits obtained from the number of relativistic degrees of freedom at bbn , with relatively mild assumptions on the reheating temperature of the dark sector .",
    "more complicated models are also allowed , depending on the details of spectrum and reheating .",
    "we found that one can not build a dark matter model charged under a hidden unbroken @xmath3 in which this new gauge group is responsible for thermal freeze out .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : alphamass ] , the required values of @xmath16 and @xmath6 required for the @xmath5 particles to form a thermal relic would violate bounds coming from limits on hard and soft scattering of dark matter in the galactic halo . as an important consequence of this argument , models in which dark matter couples to an exact copy of ordinary electromagnetism ( in particular , with @xmath159 ) are ruled out unless @xmath246  a few tev .",
    "this constrains the parameter space of models with hidden copies of the sm or the mssm in which the dark matter is electrically charged , such as the model in ref .",
    "@xcite where the stau was suggested as a dark matter candidate .    by adding additional interactions to increase the annihilation cross - section",

    "can provide an appropriately large cross section for @xmath247 annihilation .",
    "the new coupling @xmath16 must then be relatively small ( compared to the @xmath9 @xmath248 ) in order to evade galactic dynamics bounds .    the simplest model which realizes this situation is a dirac fermion in a triplet of @xmath9 ( in order to avoid @xmath249 mixing ) .",
    "bounds from the early universe then force @xmath6 to be on the order of a few tev , which implies @xmath250 .",
    "since all couplings between the dark radiation and the sm enter at two loops ( and require two dark photons in the process ) , it would be very difficult to observe the presence of the new gauge group through direct detection .",
    "instead , the best search strategy would be an indirect one : looking for the effects on galactic dynamics arising from a soft scattering mediated by a long - range force .",
    "clearly , as @xmath16 goes to zero , the model becomes indistinguishable from minimal weakly coupled dark matter .",
    "however , if the coupling is near the limit from soft scattering , one would expect detectable deviations from the assumptions of collisionless dark matter currently used in simulations .    additionally , since the @xmath3 effectively makes the dark halo a plasma ( albeit a very cold , tenuous one ) , there may be other effects on structure formation that constrain this model @xcite .",
    "we have estimated that the timescale for the weibel instability in our model is short compared to relevant timescales for galactic dynamics .",
    "if this instability has a dramatic effect when subhalos collide during the assembly of a galactic halo , our @xmath3 could be excluded for the entire range of interesting parameters .",
    "further work is required to before we reliably understand the quantitative effects of such instabilities on galactic dynamics .",
    "this work opens a window to new phenomenological possibilities within the dark sector .",
    "one avenue for further investigation would be the possibility of `` dark atoms , '' which would arise if there were two different stable species with dark charge , each with an asymmetry in the number density of positive and negative charges ( with one balancing the other to maintain overall charge neutrality ) .",
    "from there , one is free to contemplate dark chemistry and beyond .",

    "<S> we explore the feasibility and astrophysical consequences of a new long - range @xmath0 gauge field ( `` dark electromagnetism '' ) that couples only to dark matter , not to the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> the dark matter consists of an equal number of positive and negative charges under the new force , but annihilations are suppressed if the dark matter mass is sufficiently high and the dark fine - structure constant @xmath1 is sufficiently small . the correct relic abundance can be obtained if the dark matter also couples to the conventional weak interactions , and we verify that this is consistent with particle - physics constraints . </S>",
    "<S> the primary limit on @xmath1 comes from the demand that the dark matter be effectively collisionless in galactic dynamics , which implies @xmath2 for tev - scale dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> these values are easily compatible with constraints from structure formation and primordial nucleosynthesis . </S>",
    "<S> we raise the prospect of interesting new plasma effects in dark matter dynamics , which remain to be explored . </S>"
