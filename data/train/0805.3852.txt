    "the extended fkm for the spinless fermions on a @xmath14-dimensional hypercubic lattice is @xmath15 where @xmath16 @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xmath19 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of heavy ( @xmath0 ) and light ( @xmath2 ) electron at lattice site @xmath20 .",
    "the first two terms of ( 1 ) are the kinetic energies corresponding to quantum - mechanical hopping of @xmath2 and @xmath0 electrons between the nearest neighbor sites @xmath20 and @xmath21 with hopping probabilities @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "the third term represents the on - site coulomb interaction between the @xmath2 electrons with density @xmath24 and the @xmath0 electrons with density @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the number of lattice sites .",
    "usually , the hopping integral of the @xmath2 electrons is taken to be the unit of energy @xmath27 and the @xmath0-electron hopping integral is considered in the limit @xmath28 .",
    "this is a reason why the @xmath2 electrons are called light and the @xmath0 electrons heavy .    in our hf study of the extended fkm",
    "we go beyond the usual hf approach  @xcite in which only homogeneous solutions are postulated . in accordance with  @xcite",
    "we consider here also inhomogeneous solutions modeled by a periodic modulation of the order parameters : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the order parameter of the cdw state for the @xmath2- and @xmath0-electrons and @xmath32 is the excitonic average .",
    "the nesting vector @xmath33 for @xmath11 and @xmath34 for @xmath35 .    using expressions for @xmath36,@xmath37 and @xmath38 the hf hamiltonian of the extended fkm can be written as @xmath39 following the work of brydon et al .",
    "@xcite the effective hf hamiltonian is diagonalized by canonical transformation @xmath40 where @xmath41 are solutions of the associated bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) eigenequations :    @xmath42    with @xmath43 and @xmath44    the corresponding energy dispersions @xmath45 and @xmath46 can be obtained directly by the fourier transform of the @xmath2- and @xmath0-electron hopping amplitudes and for the case of hypercubic lattice they are given by ( @xmath47 ) :    @xmath48    the hf parameters @xmath49 can be written directly in terms of the bogoliubov - de gennes eigenvectors : @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 where the prime denotes summation over half the brillouin zone and @xmath56\\}$ ] is the fermi distribution function .",
    "the same approach has been used recently by brydon et al .",
    "@xcite to study the interplay between excitonic effects and the cdw instability in the fkm with on - site as well as non - local hybridization .",
    "here we use the zero temperature variant of this procedure to describe ground - state phase diagram of the spinless fkm with @xmath0-@xmath0 hopping .",
    "to determine the ground - state phase diagram of the extended fkm in the @xmath57-@xmath23 plane ( corresponding to selected @xmath1 ) the hf equations are solved self - consistently for each pair of @xmath58 values .",
    "we use an exact diagonalization method to solve the bogoliubov - de gennes equation .",
    "we start with an initial set of order parameters . by solving eq .",
    "( 7 ) , the new order parameters are computed via eqs .",
    "( 12 ) to ( 17 ) and are substituted back into eq .",
    "the iteration is repeated until a desired accuracy is achieved .",
    "first we have examined the two - dimensional extended fkm model in the intermediate coupling regime and @xmath23 negative . for this case there exists the comprehensive phase diagram of the model obtained by a cpmc technique  @xcite for @xmath0-electron hopping integrals @xmath59 . according these monte - carlo studies",
    "the phase diagram of the extended fkm consists of only three main phases , and namely , ( i ) the integer - valent state ( @xmath60 ) , ( ii ) the mixed - valent cdw state ( @xmath7 ) , and ( iii ) the mixed - valent ferroelectric state that is stable for remaining values of @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) .    in fig .  1 we have displayed typical examples of our hf solutions obtained for @xmath49 in the intermediate coupling regime @xmath63",
    "it is seen that the extended fkm in the hf approximation with the cdw instability exhibits non - vanishing excitonic @xmath64-expectation value for all @xmath0-electron densities except the case when @xmath65 and 1 .",
    "thus in accordance with the quantum monte - carlo studies  @xcite we have found that the ferroelectric ground state with the spontaneous polarization is stabilized when the system is in the mixed valence regime and the sign of the @xmath0-electron hopping integral is opposite to the sign of the @xmath2-electron one . the fact that hf solutions can describe the existence of ferroelectric ground - state with spontaneous polarization is not surprising , since this state has been found already in the homogeneous hf solution of the conventional fkm ( @xmath66 ) in the limit of vanishing hybridization @xmath67  @xcite , even for all @xmath0-electron concentrations ( for all values of @xmath57 from the @xmath2-electron band ) .",
    "what is however surprising is that the hf solutions with the cdw instability reproduce perfectly the ground - state phase diagram obtained by cpmc method for all examined values of @xmath0-electron hopping ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "this is clearly demonstrated in fig .  2 , where both phase diagrams are compared .",
    "the fact that the hf approximation with the cdw instability can describe qualitatively as well as quantitatively ground - state properties of the fkm with @xmath0-electron hopping motivated us to extend our hf study on cases that have been not described by quantum monte - carlo simulations . at first",
    "this is the case of small @xmath0-electron hopping integrals ( @xmath69 ) that has been not considered in the original work of batista et al .",
    "@xcite because numerical difficulties which appear in the quantum monte - carlo simulations for small @xmath23 ( the limitations in the numerical accuracy ) .",
    "the second interesting case that we would like to study here within the hf theory is the three - dimensional case for which the numerical results are very rare due to numerical limitations on the size of clusters .",
    "let us first discuss our two - dimensional results obtained in the limit of small values of @xmath0-electron hopping integrals . in fig .",
    "3 we present results of detailed hf analysis performed in this limit for @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "it is seen that the non - vanishing excitonic @xmath13 expectation value persists also for small values of @xmath72 but now the inhomogeneous solution @xmath73 ( with ab - sublattice oscillations in the excitonic and charge order parameters ) is stabilized against the homogeneous one ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "the effect is especially strong when we approach the @xmath66 limit .",
    "this is clearly demonstrated in fig .  4 , where the complete intermediate - coupling phase diagram of the fkm with @xmath0-@xmath0-hopping is displayed .",
    "five different phases depicted in fig .  4 as @xmath75 ( the full @xmath0 band ) , @xmath76 ( the excitonic phases ) , @xmath77 ( the cdw phase ) and @xmath78 ( the full @xmath2 band ) correspond to following hf solutions : @xmath79 the stability of different hf solutions was also checked numerically by calculating the total energy and it was found that all phases presented in the ground - state phase diagram represent the most stable hf solutions . to determine the type of transitions between different phases we have performed an exhaustive numerical study of the @xmath57 dependence of the hf order parameters ( the typical examples are shown in fig .  1 and fig .  3 ) .",
    "at a first glance it seems that there are both first - order ( @xmath23 large ) and second - order ( @xmath23 small ) phase transitions in the extended fkm with @xmath0-@xmath0 hopping .",
    "however , a more detailed analysis of numerical data ( with much higher resolution than used in fig .  1 and fig .",
    "3 ) showed that the @xmath80 phase persists also for large @xmath23 , although its stability region is now considerably reduced ( see insets in fig .  1 ) .",
    "thus there is no difference between the case of small and large values of @xmath23 . in both cases the hf order parameters change continuously indicating that the phase transitions between different phases presented in the ( @xmath57-@xmath23 ) ground - state phase diagram are of the second order .",
    "the same calculations we have performed also in the weak coupling limit ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "we have found that the phase diagrams obtained in the weak and intermediate coupling regime have qualitatively the same form and only one difference between them is that the ferroelectric domain ( @xmath82 ) is stabilized against remaining phases with decreasing coulomb interaction ( see fig .",
    "of course , this fact does not imply automatically that the excitonic @xmath13 expectation value persists also for vanishing @xmath1 and that the coulomb interaction @xmath1 is not necessary for a stabilization of the ferroelectric state , what should be in a contradiction with conclusions based on the cpmc simulations .",
    "indeed , calculations that we have performed for different values of @xmath23 at the selected @xmath0-electron density @xmath83 showed ( see fig .",
    "5 ) that the excitonic @xmath84 expectation value is zero for @xmath85 , rapidly increases with increasing @xmath1 and tends to the saturated state for @xmath1 sufficiently large .",
    "this confirms independently the third postulate of batista et al .",
    "@xcite and namely , that the local coulomb interaction between the different orbitals is required in order to stabilize the ferroelectric state with the spontaneous polarization .    before discussing the case of positive @xmath23",
    "let us show explicitly the hf solution for the limit of the conventional fkm ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "for this case we have found that @xmath86 in the @xmath87 and @xmath88 phase , while @xmath89 in the @xmath80 phase .",
    "the last solution implies that the extitonic @xmath90-expectation value is equal to @xmath91 on the @xmath92 sublattice of the hypercubic lattice , while @xmath93 on the @xmath94 sublattice . for the symmetric case @xmath95 our solutions are fully consistent with the czycholl s ones obtained in the limit of infinite dimensions  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand both these inhomogeneous solutions fully differ from the homogeneous one  @xcite that predicts a non - zero excitonic @xmath96-expectation value for all @xmath57 from the mixed valence regime with maximum of @xmath96 at @xmath95 .",
    "similar calculations as for @xmath97 we have performed also for @xmath98 .",
    "we have found that the ground - state phase diagram for @xmath98 has exactly the same form as for @xmath97 , however five different phases @xmath99 and @xmath88 are now characterized by : @xmath100 thus the main difference between the phase diagrams obtained for negative and positive @xmath23 is that the ferroelectric domain @xmath82 at @xmath97 is replaced by the antiferroelectric one at @xmath98 .",
    "these two large domains are separated by a relatively narrow @xmath80 domain within which the sublattice excitonic averages ( @xmath101 ) change continuously ( see fig .  6 ) from the ferroelectric case ( @xmath102 ) to the antiferroelectric case ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "qualitatively the same picture we have observed also for the three - dimensional case .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "7 , where the ground - state phase diagrams of the extended fkm are plotted for two different values of coulomb interaction ( @xmath63 and @xmath104 ) .",
    "these results indicate that ferroelectricity remains robust with respect to the increasing dimension of the system , what should be important for an application of hf solutions on a description of real three dimensional systems .    in conclusion",
    ", we have calculated the ground - state phase diagram of the spinless fkm with @xmath0-@xmath0 hopping in the hf approximation with the cdw instability .",
    "we have found that the hf solutions with the cdw instability reproduce perfectly the two - dimensional intermediate coupling phase diagram of the extended fkm calculated by cpmc method .",
    "using this fact we have extended our hf study on cases that have been not described by cpmc and namely , the case of small values of @xmath0-electron hopping integrals , the case of weak coulomb interactions and the three - dimensional case .",
    "we have found that the ferroelectric ground state with the spontaneous polarization remains stable in all examined cases .",
