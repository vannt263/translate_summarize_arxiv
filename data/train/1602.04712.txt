    "`` ... i will , however , maintain that we can learn at least two things from the history of science .",
    "one of these is that many of the most general and powerful discoveries of science have arisen , not through the study of phenomena as they occur in nature , but , rather , through the study of phenomena in man - made devices , in products of technology , if you will .",
    "this is because the phenomena in man s machines are simplified and ordered in comparison with those occurring naturally , and it is these simplified phenomena that man understands most easily ... thus , the existence of the steam engine , in which phenomena involving heat , pressure , vaporization , and condensation occur in a simple and orderly fashion , gave tremendous impetus to the very powerful and general science of thermodynamics .",
    "we see this especially in the work of carnot .",
    "our knowledge of aerodynamics and hydrodynamics exists chiefly because airplanes and ships exist , not because of the existence of birds and fishes .",
    "our knowledge of electricity came mainly not from the study of lightning , but from the study of man s artifacts . '' john pierce  @xcite .",
    "`` what i can not create , i do not understand '' , richard feynman    nearly 100 years have passed since the word `` robot '' was coined by karel capek in his play r.u.r .",
    "( rossum s universal robots )  @xcite ( derived from the slavic word , `` robota '' , synonymous with servitude , forced labor and drudgery  @xcite ) . in that time , largely due to the efforts of engineers and computer scientists , our society has indeed become permeated with a certain kinds ( largely virtual or immobile ) of robots : from atms to factory welding robots to smart thermostats to `` assistants '' like siri .",
    "the dream of creating robots that can interact gracefully in the physical world with humans remains science fiction ; but due to a convergence of low cost actuators , sensors , computing resources , and storage  @xcite , increasingly complex robots are soon to enter our lives in a more physical way , as the devices we wear , which assist us when we fall , drive us on roads and other terrain , or help us change light bulbs",
    ". a key ingredient enabling robots to work with us and for us will be robust mobility in all environments , so they can assist not as only rolling vacuum cleaners on hard floors , but as drainpipe inspectors , search and rescue agents in rubble , mountain , desert environments , beach lifeguards and package deliverers .    in our era",
    ", such robust all - terrain self - propelled movement remains the province of biological living systems : from cells to mice to elephants , organisms negotiate terrain no engineered device can . in recent years",
    ", human - scale robots have even begun to develop capabilities resembling those of animals ( fig .",
    "1 ) but performance in natural environments ( trees , rubble , gusty environments ) is typically low relative to biological systems . given our ability to make cars and jet airplanes move well ( in certain environments , far better than animals ! ) , this contrast in abilities seems odd .",
    "however , our best mobile engineered devices confront relatively simple environments ( like paved roads ) , allowing for relatively simple mechanical systems and controls .",
    "in contrast , animals encounter a huge diversity of environments , and have evolved morphology , controls and materials to enable robust navigation in air , water , mucous , dirt and sand . animals ( as well as robots in certain environments  @xcite ) often locomote so beautifully ( and seemingly efficiently ) we can be lulled into a false sense of security that principles and mechanisms are understood ( or if not understood , trivial or unimportant to discover ! ) .",
    "while largely unexplored in a systematic way by the robotics engineering and computer science communities , studies seeking the underlying principles of effective locomotion in natural environments have flourished under scientific inquiry , particularly among biologists and mathematicians .",
    "such efforts have led to a number of developments in characterization and modeling of locomotion which have been the focus of books and reviews  @xcite . of particular note",
    "is the efforts of biologists and mathematicians ( with some physicists ) in the development of the study of `` biofluids '' locomotion problems  @xcite , which typically have uncovered fascinating aspects of locomotion in fluids and physics relevant to fluid dynamics , but with less of a focus on general principles of control of movement .",
    "such focus tends to be found in the biological / physiological literature which develop complex theoretical models , often with tens to hundreds of parameters . while such models can give insight  @xcite they make it challenging to elucidate fundamental principles .",
    "relative to the effort expended by biologists ( including physiologists ) and mathematicians , the study of movement in complex terrain has received less attention from physicists .",
    "we suspect that to the intellectual descendants of galileo and newton , problems associated with a classical body moving from a to b either seem simple ( wheel rolling ) , solved ( newtonian mechanics ) or far too complicated ( sand - swimming ) . from our ( a group which has been studying locomotion of animals and robots on complex terrain for over a decade ) point of view",
    ", the current grasp on the principles of locomotion in modern robotics ( and biology ) is reminiscent of carnot s thoughts on the understanding of steam - powered engineering at the advent of thermodynamics : _ `` notwithstanding the work of all kinds done by steam - engines , notwithstanding the satisfactory condition to which they have been brought to - day , their theory is very little understood , and the attempts to improve them are still directed almost by chance . ''",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the works of carnot  @xcite , kelvin  @xcite , clausius  @xcite were inspired by a desire to understand the specific phenomena governing the technological improvements of engines and machines which turn steam power into motion . in turn",
    ", it required the creation of a new fundamental theory of nature , the science of thermodynamics , to unify the understanding of these phenomena .",
    "these words are inspiring to a physicist seeking general principles and perhaps new emergent phenomena associated with movement .    in this review",
    ", we will argue that building on the foundation established by biologists , mathematicians and engineers , the application of the methods and philosophy of physics can add at least two developments to help create a fundamental understanding of the necessary and sufficient conditions ( a `` minimal feature set '' ) for robust self - propelled locomotion in the real world .",
    "the first development echoes the thoughts of pierce ( above quote ) and relies on relatively recent efforts to understand the richness of biological movement through the controlled and systematic study of man - made robotic locomotors .",
    "over the past 25 years , various groups have developed robots _",
    "physical models _ of organisms and used the models to discover principles by which organisms move through air and water , on land and , in our area of focus , through granular media .",
    "such physical models are useful scientifically because they allow systematic studies on features of morphology and control in ways that are often impossible with living systems .",
    "these physical models can also form the basis for the creation and understanding of more complex real - world robots , and can more broadly demonstrate fascinating new emergent phenomena in classical dynamical systems .",
    "the second development , which we will argue provides the elements of a dynamical systems language of locomotion ( i.e. , fundamental principles of movement ) , arose in the late 1980 s when shapere and wilczek  @xcite recognized that certain types of movement , namely those involving shape changes in highly dissipative media , could be described by a `` gauge potential '' framework .",
    "this framework has already proved useful as a language for locomotion , largely due to engineers who embraced and developed it  @xcite to become predictive in relatively simple environments  @xcite and recently in a more complex medium  @xcite .",
    "we propose that the above developments form the beginnings of ( and demonstrate the need for ) a physics of moving systems  a `` locomotion robophysics '' .",
    "the latter term we define as the pursuit of fundamental principles governing movement and control of self - deforming entities ( presently electromechanical , hydraulic or pneumatic , but in the future perhaps made of pressurized elastomer networks  @xcite , carbon nanotubes  @xcite or amplified piezo arrays  @xcite ) interacting with complex environments .",
    "these are fundamentally non - equilibrium processes where motion emerges through effective interaction via internally driven actuation as opposed to equilibrium systems which naturally find free energy minima through externally driven forces .",
    "we ( as a group of experimentalists ) feel that robophysics builds on a discipline which has informally been referred to as `` experimental robotics ''  @xcite , and will likely be crucial to the discovery of novel locomotor principles . to be specific , we now present a list of what we view as important aspects of robophysical study , our proposed _",
    "foundations of robophysics _ :      as noted by pierce in the introductory quote , the history of two - way interaction between physics and engineering is quite rich , and both disciplines have benefited : examples include fluid dynamics and the design and understanding of airplanes and ships , thermodynamics / statistical mechanics and improvements in engines , understanding genetic circuits  @xcite and even quantum mechanics and improvements in ovens and lightbulbs  @xcite .",
    "thus we propose that the intersection of engineering , physics and biology will continue this mutualistic interaction ( and in successful collaborations , mutualistic teaming  @xcite ) in pursuit of understanding locomoting systems . echoing ( and perhaps distorting ) feynman s words",
    ", we argue that creating real - world engineered devices is critical if we are to claim that we understand the robophysical phenomena observed in the laboratory ; yet conversely , simple robophysical models are also critical to truly understand the phenomena that real - world engineered robots encounter in natural environments . to fully understand the physics principles discovered in the lab with experimental robophysical devices , it is important to test those principles with real world robots in natural environments that approximate laboratory conditions . observing how these principles play out in more complex devices ( or animals )",
    "can lead to observations of novel phenomena which are not observed in more controlled laboratory settings ; such phenomena then inspire new robophysics work .      to facilitate the discovery of locomotor principles",
    ", we argue that the methods of experimental physics , e.g. , joining theory with systematically controlled laboratory experiments on simplified systems , are essential . studying complex engineered devices and/or attempting to model every detail of the natural world",
    "often results in intractable complexities .",
    "thus , the locomotion robophysics approach is to experiment on simplified ( typically in the laboratory ) devices which contain the minimal geometric and control design necessary to produce dynamics similar to the complex locomotors ( robots or animals ) from which they are derived ; the robophysical devices thus function as models of the more complex locomotors .",
    "in contrast to bio - mimetic  @xcite robots which often replicate the appearance of the entire organism , robophysical devices function as models and are thus often abstracted from specific features of appendage - induced locomotion ( e.g. , leg , flipper@xcite , tail  @xcite , fin  @xcite , etc . ) .    in robotics and biology ,",
    "this approach has been most fruitful in the study of legged hopping robots , in which analysis of the simplified spring loaded inverted pendulum ( slip ) model  @xcite and associated robots @xcite has facilitated the study of hopping , jumping and running gaits .",
    "more broadly , robophysical models have been useful for comparative studies  @xcite and systematically testing hypotheses of biological locomotion .",
    "an example from our work illustrates this approach . in a study of locomotion of a hexapedal robot on granular media ,",
    "li et al  @xcite chose to study a vastly simplified and smaller model of the rhex robot , which did not have the complex controller or limbs present in the field - capable device .",
    "however , this robot proved amenable to systematic control ( see next section ) of certain parameters and enabled development of a resistive force theory which has now been successfully applied to the larger more realistic robot  @xcite .",
    "as another non - biologically motivated example , in the study of wheeled locomotion , replacing complex vehicle - terrain interaction with a single wheel allowed for a better understanding of locomotor terramechanics in wheeled vehicles  @xcite .      engineering has a long tradition in optimization and failure avoidance . in particular , failure analysis has been an important branch of engineering in designing products and materials that can avoid failures during regular use through the application of systematic methods that explicitly investigate and understand the causes of such failure modes  @xcite . in locomotion",
    "robotics research , a common approach is to engineer robots with a focus on successful task completion and then refine such `` good '' performance through a process of optimization .",
    "machine learning techniques ( see these papers  @xcite for exciting recent examples ) have been effective to this end , often times focusing on the challenge of avoiding local minima or maxima of optimality which may not necessarily lead to global robustness .",
    "this has worked quite well : engineers already create devices with whimsical names like bigdog  @xcite , rhex  @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : robots]f , g ) and atlas  @xcite(fig .",
    "[ fig : robots]c , also see petman  @xcite ) that can locomote on relatively complex terrain despite the lack of understanding of the dynamics of the robot interacting with the environment . yet , while a focus on optimization and safety factors can clearly help mitigate failures and ensure success in specific situations , neglecting a study of fundamental locomotor principles comes at a certain cost .",
    "feedback control schemes based on increasingly sophisticated on - board sensing and computing platforms  @xcite can be optimized specifically with disturbance rejection of environmental unknowns in mind , yet it is often impossible to know if such robots will always perform well in a diversity of environments ( and why they fail when they do ) without an understanding of the dynamical system that is comprised of the physical device , its controller and interactions with the environment .",
    "robophysics , on the other hand , does not distinguish failure from success , as the goal is not necessarily optimization or the avoidance of failure , but rather the principles of environment - locomotor interaction that produce different performance outcomes .",
    "studying failure modes and success using the methods of robophysics can reveal the subtlety and beauty in how non - failing behaviors emerge .",
    "in addition , a broad exploration of a parameter space can lead to a greater understanding of the mechanisms of optimal performance that can then be extended to a wider range of scenarios ( through nondimensionalization , for example ) .",
    "a few examples from our own robophysical work serve as examples by which this process can produce new mobility : while the rhex robot displayed beautiful ability to bounce across hard ground and some ability to walk across granular substrates , the reason different parameters in the limb controller worked well were unknown .",
    "it was not until we undertook systematic studies of performance on granular media of varying compaction that we revealed the robophysical mechanics underpinning rhex s locomotor abilities , and in addition , why the locomotion was so sensitive to aspects of the ground and the controller  @xcite .",
    "as another example , a robotic snake  @xcite effective in many environments including hard ground , pipes , poles and water was unable to climb sandy slopes without catastrophic slips until systematic experiments revealed that contact length of the snake must be properly modulated to prevent yielding , maintain balance , and reduce stress on the granular substrate ,  @xcite ( section  [ sec : sidew ] ) . since then , we have been able to create designs and new control schemes that improve robustness of these devices . and in a study on robotic sand jumping  @xcite , various jumping strategies were surveyed , one of which performed poorly ; further analysis revealed the mechanism for failure was an added mass effect that had never been confirmed in dry granular media , which has implications about fast locomotion on granular media beyond jumping .    systematically surveying a parameter space  while critical to compare theory and experiment , discover transitions and bifurcations in dynamics , and understand transitions in performance modes  has an inherent repetitiveness which leads to a labor - intensive endeavor when manually executed by humans .",
    "taking inspiration from the methodologies of physics ( largely from fields like nonlinear dynamics and condensed matter physics ) , our group has begun a program of automating our experiments , in effect , creating robots that control robots and their locomotor environments .",
    "we will illustrate how such automation is becoming a critical feature of robophysics , allowing for high throughput parameter variation .",
    "a few examples from our work are shown in figure  [ fig : auto ] .",
    "such automation then allows systematically exploring parameters and identifying the most important parameters of more complex systems  @xcite .      the earliest widespread use of feedback control ( or at least its onset of popularity and interest among engineers )",
    "can be traced back to the 18th century , with the centrifugal governor invented by james watt ( first analyzed by maxwell  @xcite ) to regulate the speed of the steam engine , where the intelligence of the controller was embedded in the passive mechanics of the device  @xcite .",
    "these early devices were later treated to in - depth analyses of the physics principals on which they operate  @xcite . today , much effort in the locomotion robotics community has been spent in developing feedback control strategies to generate stable movement patterns in different environments . however , from a robophysics perspective , these approaches can leave unexplored important questions regarding high - level ( behavioral ) objectives of control and learning , many of which were anticipated by the mathematicians von neumann and wiener ( and others )  @xcite during the heyday of the cyberneticians  @xcite ( with ` cyber ' adapted from _ kybernan _ , the greek word meaning to steer or govern  @xcite ) .",
    "we argue that utilizing the methods of robophysics in conjunction with a particular approach to locomotor control can advance the control of movement in the real world .",
    "our approach to locomotor control of movement is encapsulated in the ideas developed by full and koditschek in their seminal paper  @xcite and nicely discussed in a control theory framework in  @xcite . in this work , to tame the complexity of understanding the control of movement in complex animals , the authors proposed to formulate the modeling process into a hierarchical structure of complexity , consisting of `` templates '' and `` anchors '' , where templates are reduced order models with a minimal number of parameters that encode the behavior of more complex locomotors and prescribe high - level control strategies to achieve such locomotor behavior  @xcite .",
    "anchors are the more detailed and complex underlying mechanistic systems which can be controlled to follow the template . adding the robophysics approach to the templates / anchors scheme can be an invaluable tool to create life - like locomoting robots ( which are increasingly complex with emergent dynamics that defy a reductionist understanding ) .",
    "such an approach is very much aligned with the spirit of pierce s quote in our introduction which seeks to study simplified models ( here of animals and robots ) to discover fundamental principles . for the physicist ,",
    "addressing questions in the control of movement from a template / anchor plus robophysical approach will generate interesting ( and likely novel ) dynamical systems that incorporate not only newton s laws applied to the robot and environment , but also computational laws  the models that ultimately define and limit the feedback schemes .",
    "we will argue that recent developments in the field of geometric mechanics ( see section [ sec : geomech ] ) hint at a general framework to discover templates , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "however , understanding closed - loop locomotor efficacy in complex environments will require more than the combination of control theory , dynamics and soft matter physics ; as the reader has no - doubt surmised , our group argues that systematic experiments are critical !    our work in sidewinding locomotion exemplifies of the power of this approach . as we will discuss in more detail in section [ sec : sidew ] , systematic experimentation with a snake robot ( as well as biological observations ) revealed that sidewinding locomotion , complicated though it may seem , can be generated by a relatively simple template consisting of superimposed vertical and horizontal propagating waves of body curvature at @xmath0 phase offset from each other  @xcite .",
    "this two - wave model was originally developed by the engineers in our group to effect locomotion of their robot on hard ground .",
    "however , once we identified this pattern as a template ( which is also followed by the robot s biological counterpart , the sidewinder rattlesnake ) , it became clear how a sand - dwelling limbless locomotor benefits from controlling its shape to follow this pattern .",
    "for example , we discovered that sandy slopes could be effectively climbed by modulating the vertical wave to elicit a solid - like response from the sand  @xcite .",
    "subsequent studies revealed how other modulations ( amplitude and phase ) of the two - wave template generated sidewinding turning behaviors  @xcite . using modulations of the template to drive behavior greatly simplifies locomotion in this system ( see the example of maze - following in  @xcite ) . and with the template ( and its modulations ) in hand , we can understand the necessary ingredients ( motors , sensors , skin ) the anchor must possess to generate these diverse behaviors ( and thereby close the loop to develop autonomous robots ) .",
    "for example , during movement on inclined granular media , encoders for each actuator may be sufficient to control the body to follow a template , but must be augmented with sensors that can determine body slip and average inclination .",
    "the study ( and use ) of engineered robotic systems will not only enable progress in a diversity of physics disciplines such as soft matter and complex non - equilibrium systems ( as well as biological locomotion ) , but such progress will also be rapidly accelerated through automation granted by robotics .",
    "conversely , the methodologies native to physics will help illuminate general principles of robot locomotion relevant to robot control and design ( and biological systems ) .",
    "once the principles are worked out in the robophysical system , they can be instantiated and tested in more robust devices or sought out in organisms .",
    "we now list a few areas that we predict will benefit from the robophysics discipline .    _ dynamical and nonequilibrium systems _ : the locomotion of robots through an environment can serve as an excellent model system to advance our understanding of the features of complex dynamical systems driven far from equilibrium ( like robustness and complexity  @xcite as well as emergenent phenomena  @xcite ) .",
    "more down to earth , the study of robots as dynamical systems is a sure way to create novel inquiry into dynamical systems , particularly when aspects of feedback control are considered  @xcite , as has been demonstrated in the robotics and applied mathematics communities ( e.g. periodic orbits in robot hopping  @xcite and juggling  @xcite , stability of hybrid dynamical systems in running robots  @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , themes and tools from literature studying low and high dimensional dynamical systems ( phase portraits , bifurcations , limit cycles , chaos , pattern formation , normal forms ) form a useful language and conceptual framework / underpinnings for understanding stability and control of locomoting systems . and experimental inquiry into robophysical systems can certainly help to test theoretical predictions and challenge and introduce new concepts .",
    "for example , we will emphasize recent ( since the 1980s ) advances in geometric mechanics , originally proposed as a framework to study locomotion at low reynolds number , but since used to frame a wide class of problems including self - righting cats , reorienting satellites , the snakeboard@xcite , and effective locomotion of sand - swimming robots through proper `` self - deformation '' patterns ( see section  [ sec : geomech ] ) . from our point of view",
    ", experimental tests and inquiry have not kept pace with these exciting theoretical advances . and because they can be decomposed into a hierarchy of systems with increasing dimension , locomoting systems can also provide excellent tests of `` mesoscopic '' dynamical systems composed of a large number of degrees of freedom .",
    "for example , studying the locomotor stability of a robot composed of increasingly complicated actuation and control mechanisms poses questions into the sensitivity of gross behaviors to lower level parameters  @xcite .",
    "perhaps the work on `` sloppy '' models  @xcite will be applicable here ; locomoting robophysical systems can provide an arena to experimentally test such theories .",
    "_ soft matter physics _ : locomotion robophysics promises to advance our understanding of terrain composed of materials that are neither rigid solids nor newtonian fluids ( like sand , snow and grass ) with complex rheological response to interaction , that is `` soft matter '' systems .",
    "as advocated in  @xcite , in which `` every step is an experiment '' , robophysics can aid in the discovery of new soft matter physics by revealing the unique locomotor dynamics that arise from robot - substrate interactions , which can inspire systematic studies of these often novel interactions with soft matter  @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion of most terrestrial substrates are not yet known , and thus _ require _ experimental methods to understand how movement emerges from interaction with these environments .",
    "further , such materials and interactions are `` non - standard '' in the soft - matter literature yet ubiquitous in natural environments substrates , thus offering a rich array of systems to be studied .    once such ( typically complex ) interactions are identified , the machinery of soft matter physics can be applied to systematically develop empirical understanding of responses .",
    "one of our recent studies  @xcite ( briefly discussed in section [ sec : highspeed ] ) makes this abundantly clear : while impact into dry granular media has been studied in different regimes for hundreds of years , new physics associated with jamming and added mass were revealed only after analyzing the sand jumping dynamics of a 1-d legged robot . unlike standard impact  @xcite and constant speed intrusion  @xcite experiments , jumping produced much more complex granular interactions that , when analyzed , revealed new transient dynamics which significantly influence locomotor performance .",
    "other examples in dry granular media we will discuss include `` disturbed ground '' in the flipperbot work  @xcite ( section  [ sec : flip ] ) or resistive forces on sandy slopes like found in the sidewinding snake study  @xcite ( section  [ sec : sidew ] ) . and such empirical insights from experiment can inspire new theoretical advances ( see  @xcite for a recent example based on granular resistive force theory )",
    ". a better understanding of interaction with soft matter will lead to a `` terradynamics ''  @xcite of land - based locomotion ( in analogy with hydro- and aerodynamics which allow submarines and planes to explore water and air ) and allow robots to robustly and independently explore disaster sites , comets and other celestial objects .    _",
    "biological movement and principles of robustness in living systems _ : as noted throughout the introduction , a robophysics of locomotion can advance our understanding of biological movement .",
    "robophysics can thus be a critical element in understanding aspects of movement within a more broad `` physics of living systems '' .",
    "such advances can result from physicists tendency toward instrumentation and model building , but also from the desire in the discipline to focus on simplification as a tool to understand complex systems ( e.g. finding the `` hydrogen atom '' of the problem ) .",
    "because of this , robophysics can provide a practical starting point to discover important functional principles  @xcite in living systems ( building on , of course , foundational work in cybernetic  @xcite and physiological modeling as well as the study of organism movement using the tools of dynamical systems  @xcite ) .",
    "locomotion robophysics can be used to confront issues of biological robustness  @xcite whereby complex organisms are studied in terms of the hierarchical and heterarchical organization of their mechanical and control structures .",
    "locomotion robophysics can also provide `` hands - on '' systems to examine modeling approaches in systems composed of many degrees - of - freedom , common in many areas of science and engineering ( e.g. see for example  @xcite for a discussion of complex models in systems biology ) .    specifically , building on advances in physical modeling of organisms , robots ( and experimentally validated simulations ) can be used to test biological hypotheses concerning body and limb morphology , neuromechanical control hypotheses  @xcite , including the systematic search for templates and anchors  @xcite in physiologically relevant environments .",
    "these systems are much simpler and amenable to analysis , and require fundamental study of dynamical systems , complex networks , among other topics .",
    "the robots function as physical models , which as argued above are , when models of the environment are unavailable , are perhaps the _ only _ methods to model organism movement . in this way",
    ", robophysics in biology subscribes to feynman s philosophy highlighted in our introduction  biological systems ( nor complex engineered devices ) can not be _ understood _ without building or creating models whose goal is to reveal fundamental , cross - cutting principles by which living systems move with such efficacy in a staggering array of natural substrates .",
    "the modeling framework of templates and anchors  @xcite provides a powerful framework by which robophysics can aid biology from the `` top - down '' through studying principles of life using robots , and perhaps can be on occasion more tractable than by dismantling biological systems ( synthesis vs. reduction ) .",
    "we argue that directly probing ensemble processes in complex biological structures proves too intractable to develop meaningful and predictive models of locomotion .",
    "in fact , a number of physicists are thinking about behaviors in a similar way to the approach in  @xcite . members of bialek s group have contributed significantly to identifying how these templates emerge in insects as stereotyped template behaviors  @xcite . using the methods of robophysics",
    ", we can aid biology in testing and understanding these templates and anchors by physically instantiating them with robots . such robots , as physical models , are a much richer representation of living systems than mathematical models alone ,",
    "however , both must be studied in parallel .",
    "such an approach is also able to systematically probe the effects of progressively increasing locomotor and environmental complexity ( extra appendages , geometric features , environment heterogeneity , etc . ) .",
    "_ improved real - world robots _ : and finally , robophysics will help discover principles why our best robots significantly under - perform living locomoting systems in arbitrary terrain ; and how to improve the performance of engineered devices in real - world environments .",
    "thus from the engineering perspective , the robophysics approach can also help us rethink how we approach robotics : we can begin to break the seemingly endless cycle building and programming new iterations of field - ready robots that barely outperform their predecessors . already ( as we will show ) our robophysics studies demonstrate that we do not have to engineer hardened robots to do beautiful robot experiments . perhaps focusing on simplified model systems",
    "can be a more practical and time ( and money ) saving way to unlock truly advanced mobility .",
    "once the principles are studied in a laboratory setting and once important physics of dynamical systems and soft matter and controls are learned , these lessons can then be used to guide the design of hardened devices that are actually capable of being deployed to search , rescue , and explore .",
    "the remainder of our review is organized around specific examples involving single robots interacting with environments that create challenges for scientists and engineers and which encapsulate the foundations of locomotion robophysics as delineated above .",
    "our examples are of course not exhaustive ( and we hope will not prove exhausting ) but serve to illustrate the effectiveness of the robophysics approach in different environments , whereby the use of simple robot models facilitate the iterative comparison between experiment , simulation and analytical theory .",
    "our review will focus on terrestrial locomotion robophysics , largely because we feel this is a neglected area and one in which our group has made recent progress in the robophysics vein .",
    "we will predominantly focus on steady rhythmic interactions with the environment , a tiny subset of possible behaviors ( impulsive jumps , jerks , etc . ) .",
    "in addition to sections describing progress we have made in specific environments , we will also highlight ( in blue `` sidebar '' sections ) other fields which benefit from robophysical studies , such as paleorobotics and biomechanics . we will also comment on computer simulation as a critical component which , when validated against experiment , allows for computer models of movement , and access to quantities that are challenging to measure in experiment . and we will devote a section to geometric mechanics , as we feel this framework is appealing to physicists as it allows understanding the character of locomotion . following our introduction above , we will discuss :    * * section [ sec : simple ] : locomotion robophysics in hard ground environments : * we discuss various studies of robots hopping , running and jumping on hard ground ; such studies have led to arguably the most successful legged robots in operation today . in particular we highlight how one of our first experiments to be fully automated reveals that complex dynamics emerge from even the simplest robotic system , a monopod hopper  @xcite . in a later section ( [ sec : highspeed ] ) , we show how even this simple system challenges our current understanding of soft materials when we examine jumping on granular media .",

    "* * section [ sec : gm_robo ] : robophysics in granular media , movement on and within a substrate between solid and fluid : * we discuss our work on locomotion through dry granular media .",
    "in particular , we discuss how the frictional aspects of granular media dominate the movement of relatively slow robots , including a larger hexapod  @xcite ( section [ sec : rhex ] ) , a robotic sidewinder  @xcite ( section [ sec : sidew ] ) , and a turtle - inspired device  @xcite ( section [ sec : flip ] ) ; the disturbance and  memory \" of the ground plays a major role .",

    "li et al . systematically studied the locomotion of a rhex - class robot ( sandbot ) , a legged device that is tuned to run on hard ground  @xcite , and discovered that ground reaction forces and robot dynamics on granular media depended sensitively on actuation parameters such as leg frequency  @xcite and intra - cycle leg kinematics ( relative phasing between fast and slow leg rotations )  @xcite . using sandbot as a physical model , li et al .",
    "found that the robot kinematics at low leg frequency could be described using a rotary walking model  @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sandbot]d inset ) which could predict robot step length and forward speed . according to this model , the legs penetrated a yielding substrate until granular reaction forces balanced robot weight and body inertia , at which point the substrate solidified and the legs stopped penetrating and began rotating to propel the body forward .",
    "+    in recent work , qian et al .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the rotary walking model could be generalized to explain the locomotion performance for both robotic and biological locomotors with scale from 10 g to 2.5 kg . by systematically studying locomotor performance ( i.e. , average forward speed ) of a 2.5 kg , cylindrical legged robot , qian et al . derived a universal scaling model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sandbot]d ) that revealed a sensitive dependence of speed on the leg penetration ratio for all stiffnesses and gait frequencies .",
    "the model was then applied to running lizards , geckos and crabs , to explain the differences in performance loss observed in these animals as ground stiffness was reduced . to extend our result to include continuous variation of locomotor foot pressure",

    "despite the variation in morphology and gait , the performance of lizards , geckos and crabs were also determined by their leg penetration ratio , as the universal model predicts .",
    "a further analysis of performance loss rate suggested that locomotors with smaller foot pressure can passively maintain minimal leg penetration ratio as the ground weakens , and consequently permit effective high - speed running over low stiffness ground . to summarize , this legged robot moves effectively on granular media when design and actuation strategy minimize yielding of the substrate .",
    "limbless locomotion on dry granular media is another excellent system for robophysical study . in particular ,",
    "the sidewinding gait exemplifies how robophysics can aid physics , engineering and biology .",
    "sidewinding is a strange gait observed only in certain snakes that live on flowable material , such as the rattlesnake ( _ crotalus cerastes _ ) and prescribed by engineers to move limbless robots over diverse terrain .",
    "kinematic data from biological sidewinders is relatively easy to acquire and provides a strong basis on which to ground this study .",
    "however , the lack of available computational models capturing the snakes dynamics on sand makes it difficult to systematically test hypotheses formulated from biological data .",
    "this highlights the need for a controllable physical model that approximates the biological system s motion and environmental interaction .",
    "an example of such a model is the modular snake robot locomoting on granular media used in  @xcite .    the snake robot in  @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mod_snake]a ) was used to study the physics of sidewinding on granular inclines .",
    "experimental kinematic data of ( _ crotalus cerastes _ ) sidewinding revealed an increase in length of body segments in contact with the sand as the inclination of the granular slope increased .",
    "it was hypothesized that snakes regulate contact length to minimize slip while traversing sloped surfaces . to test this ,",
    "sidewinding motion was implemented on the snake robot using a two - wave model  @xcite comprised of orthogonal waves posteriorly traveling in the horizontal and vertical body planes ( fig .",

    "modulation of the relative amplitudes of the two waves changed the eccentricity of the sidewinding robot s overall shape , which in turn regulated the length of contacting body segments . testing",
    "contact lengths on different slopes revealed two distinct failure modes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mod_snake]d ) : tipping over due to gravity , or slipping due to the substrate yielding .",
    "as the inclination of the surface increased , the robot had to increase contact length to both maintain balance as well as reduce the stress applied to the substrate . however , excessive contact length ( insufficient lifting ) introduced unnecessary drag force which in turn caused the substrate to yield .",
    "thus , using grid - based optimization , it was empirically determined that an optimal length of contact as a function of the slope existed , one which maximized stability while minimizing slip and drag .",
    "this observation confirmed the importance of biological sidewinders regulating contact length to minimize slip / yielding on granular slopes .",
    "this result led to a larger idea : the sidewinding gait is a control template ( a neuromechanical target of control ) for locomotion on granular material , one that allows effective locomotion on yielding granular media through appropriate manipulation of the substrate .",
    "the template is formed when the snake ( or the robot ) propagates two waves down the body , one in the horizontal plane , the other in the vertical plane ( as discussed above ) . in both the animal and robot ,",
    "these waves are phased by @xmath0 radians . the increase in contact length",
    "can be viewed as an amplitude modulation of the vertical wave to control for possible yielding of the granular material .",
    "other modulations of the two - wave template produce turning behaviors in the robot similar to those observed in the animals ; in  @xcite , we discovered that the snakes could reorient over several gait cycles ( which we called `` differential turns '' ) or could rapidly ( within a cycle ) change direction ( which we called `` reversals '' ) .",
    "neither of these turns produced significant slip or flowing of the material . in the robot ,",
    "modulation of the horizontal wave with increasing amplitude from head to tail resulted in differential turns while a sudden phase modulation of the vertical wave by @xmath1 radians yielded reversal turns with performance comparable to the animal .",

    "dem is simple to implement for small numbers of spherical particles .",
    "however _ efficient _ simulation of granular media is not trivial . for large scale problems like dense granular flow with millions of particles , using the lcp formulation",
    "like we do for hard ground becomes untenable .",
    "the lcp iterative solver is of order @xmath5 in time ( where @xmath6 is the number of contacts and is proportional to the number of grains in the system ) for each iteration . to make the situation more challenging , the solver needs to be called at every time step to resolve the collisions .",
    "in contrast , dem uses compliant particles ( the `` regularization method ''  @xcite ) instead .",
    "combined with a grid partition scheme for collision detection , the time scaling can be reduced to order @xmath7 for many practical problems .",
    "the accuracy of dem for dense granular flow is well established and reliable  @xcite , provided collision force parameters ( typically more than two but fewer than 6 ) are tuned correctly and the time step is small enough .",
    "these parameters ( restitution , friction coefficients , etc . ) can be empirically tuned such that simulated forces on intruders moving in a granular medium ( e.g. , a rod dragged horizontally ) match experimental measurements  @xcite .",

    "the future of direct granular simulations looks promising ; the cone complementarity problem ( ccp ) formulation proposed by tasora  @xcite ( which is also being used in chrono::engine ) uses a matrix - free iterative solver with time proportional to n for each iteration .",
    "compared with the dem method , where the time step needs to be much smaller ( due to grain stiffness ) , the non - smooth dynamic ( complementarity ) approach can potentially use larger time steps and remain stable .",

    "however , their efficacy has not been tested in situations relevant to locomotion , in which solid - like and fluid - like states coexist .",

    "in the presence of complex moving boundaries , full navier - stokes equations for complex flows often could not be solved ( without cfd ) .",
    "instead , pioneers made simpler approximations in viscous fluids .",
    "the best known of these , called resistive force theory ( rft )  @xcite , assumes that the deforming body can be partitioned into segments , each experiencing drag , and that the flow / force fields from these segments are hydrodynamically decoupled and do not influence the fields of other segments . therefore , the normal and tangential forces on a small element depend only on the local properties , namely",

    "the characteristics of @xmath13 and @xmath14 are different between viscous fluids and granular media . for low speed motion in fluids , rft forces are velocity dependant both in direction and magnitude , whereas forces in granular media are independent of the velocity magnitude . additionally , unlike in fluids , grain - grain friction and gravity lead to a depth dependence in granular rft forces .    to determine fluid rft forces , experiments are often needed , because analytical solutions to the stokes equations can not be easily obtained even in simple cases ( e.g. , a finite length cylinder moving in the axial direction ) . similarly in granular media , where there is no constitutive law , @xmath13 and @xmath14 has primarily been determined from experiment or dem simulation .",
    "most recently in a study by askari and kamrin  @xcite , however , a friction - based continuum model known as plasticity theory has been shown to reproduce experimental granular rft measurements when simulated with fea techniques .",
    "moreover , the study was able to analytically uncover how , even though rft was originally developed to simplify the analysis of viscous fluid interactions , the superposition of rft forces is in fact more predictive in granular media than in fluids .",

    "have been found to be reproducible with the continuum equations of rft @xcite .",
    "rft was also extensively used to investigate various aspects of sand swimming in both artifical  @xcite and biological  @xcite locomotors .",
    "for example , granular rft was used to model how neuromechanical phase lag ( npl ) ( a phenomenon observed in many undulatory animals during which the wave of muscle activation progresses faster than the wave of body bending  @xcite ) emerges .",
    "ding et al .",
    "@xcite used rft to explain the source of npl during sand swimming in the frictional ( non - inertial ) regime .",
    "the timing of torque onset ( which corresponds to muscle activation ) , computed from rft , agreed well with experimentally observed electromyography signals in a sandfish lizard , indicating that npl may depend strongly on details of the environmental interactions .",
    "however , during fast locomotion , rft is an insufficient descriptor of locomotion dynamics in granular media .",
    "for example , the performance of the dynaroach s high speed gaits  @xcite deviated from the rotary walking model , which , similar to rft , assumes of quasistatic interactions .",

    "non - forced impact studies suggest that such one dimensional intrusion forces can be predicted with a relation that accounts for both quasi - static frictional forces as well as velocity dependent inertial drag  @xcite . to test these force relations , we installed the robot ( originally used in hard ground jumping experiments  @xcite ) in a bed of granular media that controls volume faction ( loose packed , @xmath18 , to close packed , @xmath19 ) via air fluidization , air pulses , and bed shaking ( fig .",

    "after hundreds of automated experimental jumps were performed , comparison between jump heights in experiment and simulation revealed that models combining inertial drag and hydrostatic friction were insufficient , inspiring a more in - depth examination of granular kinematics  @xcite .",
    "this required a simultaneous study of both robot and substrate , which was achieved by moving the jumper next to the sidewall for direct measurement of grain kinematics via piv analysis of high speed video capture .",
    "this analysis revealed a cone of grains that solidified underneath the foot and moved with the foot . a geometric model of this cone s growth with respect to the foot s intrusion depth in conjunction with empirical rft measurements  @xcite was able to predict the quasistatic resistive force on the foot .",
    "furthermore , the cone s dynamics signaled that an added mass effect - an effect observed in fluids in which the mass of an intruder moving through a media is effectively increased as it accelerates and displaces surrounding material ( see@xcite for a review of added mass in fluids ) - was producing a non - negligible impact on the robot s kinematics .",
    "consequently , a 1-d reactive force theory incorporating added mass was able to reproduce experimental jump heights in simulation  @xcite .",
    "insight into high speed granular locomotion will improve by extending this reactive force theory , or dynamic rft , for 3d motion .",

    "however , there have been few  @xcite experimental tests of these theories , as early work in geometric mechanics were conducted in a purely mathematical context .",
    "save for some early physical robotic implementations  @xcite , research interests largely centered on investigating how differential equations evolve given cyclic inputs  @xcite , with a focus on evaluating idealized simple models which more readily facilitated geometric analysis .",
    "members of our group later demonstrated that the dynamics of locomoting systems in non - ideal conditions can have mathematical structures similar to those of the ideal systems studied in the geometric mechanics literature , and that their differential equations can be populated empirically or from simulation  @xcite .",
    "this observation let us separate geometric gait analysis from model construction , and now makes physical experiments much more viable .",
    "we will amplify on this study in more detail below .",
    "a key product of the theoretical work above was the development of the _ reconstruction equation _ for locomoting systems , which relates internal shape changes to the velocity of the body relative to an inertial frame .",
    "the reconstruction equation has been derived for a diverse set of systems , including those that locomote across land , swimming in a variety of fluid regimes , or float freely in space .",
    "the value of the reconstruction equation ( and more generally in deriving geometric models ) , whether analytic or empirical , is that it becomes relatively straightforward to qualitatively understand the _ character _ of locomotion , without having to necessarily think about the forces that ultimately govern particular behaviors .",

    "this linear relationship between shape and body velocities is referred to as the _ kinematic _ reconstruction equation , which has the form @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the body velocity relative to the inertial frame , @xmath23 is the shape velocity , and @xmath24 , the _ local connection _ , encodes the constraints between changes in shape and changes in position .",

    ", the authors showed that the local connection of the three - link swimmer in granular media could be derived empirically by locally perturbing its joint angles at different locations in the shape space using rft simulation .",
    "the second advance has come from identification of coordinate choices that extend the quantitative accuracy of the geometric methods to large amplitude gaits .",
    "the original work in  @xcite was developed to study movement resulting from infinitesimally small self - deformations .",

    "robotic locomotors which can coexist alongside animal counterparts can fulfill the dream of one of the early cyberneticians , louis couffignal , who defined the field as `` the art of ensuring the efficacy of action ''  @xcite",
    ". however , while cybernetics became an awkward ( and often maligned ) relative of computer science , we feel that robophysics can fulfill the original spirit of the discipline , in that it emphasizes and adds locomotion ( and to physics ) to the important aspects of `` control and communication in the organism and machine '' ( see also  @xcite for recent discussion of similar issues ) . importantly ( for both physics and cybernetics )",
    "robophysics emphasizes the need to do high quality , systematic experiments in conjunction with theory and modeling .",
