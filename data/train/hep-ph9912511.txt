    "there is a large hierarchy among the fermion masses that have been observed .",
    "this hierarchy can not be explained within the standard model and thus tackling this problem gives crucial clues to high energy physics beyond the standard model .",
    "one of the solution to this problem is introducing a flavor symmetry , which acts on fermions in a flavor dependent way @xcite .",
    "another problem that has not been solved is the origin of the cp violation .",
    "cp symmetry is a very good symmetry , but it has been observed that cp is violated in the neutral k meson system by a small amount .",
    "this smallness of the cp violation is also a mystery in particle physics .",
    "one of the convincing solution to this problem is the spontaneous cp violation ( scpv ) @xcite .",
    "this idea is very attractive since it can control the small amount of the observed cp violation quite naturally .",
    "recently the impact of the existence of the large extra dimensions , which is indicated by the string theory @xcite , are discussed in many papers .",
    "the main impact of this possibility is that the fundamental scale of the theory @xmath0 can be lowered from the planck scale ( @xmath1  gev ) to a much lower scale @xcite .",
    "this argument is assumed that only gravitons can propagate into the large extra dimensions and the standard model particles are confined to a four - dimensional hypersurface , such as a d3-brane @xcite . in the case that the gauge bosons of the standard model ( and some of the matter particles ) also propagate into the extra dimensions , we can lower the grand unification scale @xmath2 to the tev region due to the power - law running of the gauge couplings @xcite .",
    "another implication of the large extra dimensions is the volume factor suppression of the couplings between the bulk fields and boundary fields , which is used to explain the smallness of the neutrino masses in ref.@xcite .",
    "this suppression was also used to explain the hierarchy among the masses of quarks and leptons @xcite .    in this paper , we discuss the minimal model in which the fermion mass hierarchy is realized by an abelian flavor symmetry and the smallness of the cp violation is controlled by the scpv scenario in the context of the large extra dimensions .",
    "then we will show that various phenomenological problems can be solved by introducing only scales below the low fundamental scale ( 1000  tev in our scenario ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we will introduce our model and realize the realistic hierarchy among fermion masses . in section  [ scpv ] , we will estimate cp violation parameters and show that they are consistent with the experimental values , and other phenomenological implications are discussed in section  [ opi ] .",
    "section  [ concl ] is devoted to conclusions .",
    "we will introduce an abelian global symmetry @xmath3 as the flavor symmetry . here",
    "we will deal with the 4-higgs - doublet ( 4hd ) model because it is the minimal model that causes scpv as is explained later .",
    "thus some symmetry is required to suppress the dangerous flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) and we will introduce the @xmath4 symmetry , which distinguishes the `` standard '' higgs doublets that mainly give masses to fermions from the `` extra '' higgs doublets that are prevented from having vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) .",
    "since the fundamental scale @xmath0 is around 1000  tev in our scenario , the supersymmetry ( susy ) is assumed to avoid the naturalness problem .",
    "r - parity is assumed here .",
    "we will consider the case that there is a large extra dimension , which is compactified by the radius @xmath5 , besides the usual four - dimensional space - time and some fields feel the fifth dimension while the others are confined to a four - dimensional boundary .",
    "the field contents of our model and their charges of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 parity are listed in table  [ 4dfld ] and table  [ 5dfld ] .",
    "here @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 represent the superfields of the @xmath11-th generation of the left - handed quark doublet , right - handed up - type quark singlet , right - handed down - type quark singlet , left - handed lepton doublet and right - handed charged lepton singlet , respectively .",
    "@xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) are the gauge superfields and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) are the superfields of the higgs doublets .",
    "they are all the description from the viewpoint of the four - dimensional theory , and the superfields listed in table  [ 5dfld ] should be interpreted as the kaluza - klein zero modes for the extra dimension .",
    "@xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the five - dimensional gauge - singlet scalar fields and their superpartners .",
    ".the fields that can propagate into the extra dimension and their @xmath3 charges .",
    "the numbers in the parentheses are @xmath4 parity . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     here we will give a brief explanation of the volume factor suppression .",
    "let us denote @xmath19 as a five - dimensional bulk field , where @xmath20 represents the coordinate of the extra dimension .",
    "if we fourier expand @xmath21 then we can regard @xmath22 as a four - dimensional field corresponding to the @xmath23-th kaluza - klein mode .",
    "on the other hand , the boundary fields are localized at the four - dimensional wall whose thickness is of order @xmath24 , @xcite .",
    "] so a coupling involving at least one boundary field is suppressed by a factor of @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a number of bulk fields included in the coupling @xcite .    with the above charge assignment , we have the yukawa couplings with the following structure after the scalar fields @xmath16 and @xmath18 obtain the vevs ,    @xmath27    @xmath28    @xmath29    where @xmath30    here @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "note that the bulk fields @xmath16 and @xmath18 have the mass dimension of 3/2 .",
    "eq.([yukawa ] ) suggests that @xmath33 , so that @xmath34 . if @xmath35 , i.e. , @xmath36 , the realistic hierarchy between fermion masses can be realized . and",
    "@xmath37 do not destroy this hierarchy . ]",
    "the value of @xmath37 is constrained from ref.@xcite to be greater than 2  tev , so we will set @xmath38  tev throughout this paper . and the planck scale @xmath39 in the case of the @xmath40 extra dimensions is @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the radius of the @xmath11-th extra dimension .",
    "we have assumed the existence of more extra dimensions that are irrelevant to our discussion to satisfy this relation . ]",
    "therefore @xmath43  tev , @xmath44  tev and @xmath45 .",
    "we can expand the bulk field @xmath16 around its vev in terms of four - dimensional fields @xmath46 as follows .",
    "@xmath47    where @xmath48 and @xmath20 represent the four - dimensional coordinates and the coordinate of the extra dimension respectively .",
    "these fluctuation fields @xmath46 are thought to have masses of order @xmath49 if @xmath40 is not very large .",
    "since these are much lighter than the counterpart of the usual froggatt - nielsen mechanism @xcite , tree - level processes exchanging these light @xmath46 seem to cause the disastrously large fcnc at first sight . however , their couplings to the light quarks and leptons are largely suppressed by the large power of the volume factor @xmath50 , so there are no dangerous fcnc processes arising from @xmath46-exchange .",
    "there are another flavor changing interactions that might give rise to too large fcnc . in the case of an abelian flavor symmetry ,",
    "flavor changing 4-fermi interactions such as @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are quark fields , are allowed @xcite . in our case , however , taking into account the volume factor suppression , this flavor changing interaction terms are    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is a dimensionless @xmath56 constant .",
    "thus an effective cut - off @xmath57 becomes @xmath58  tev and the fcnc arising from these interactions do not exceed the experimental bounds .",
    "( see table  1 in ref.@xcite . )      in the case that the gauge bosons of the standard model propagate into the large extra dimensions , the grand unification scale @xmath2 is significantly lowered @xcite .",
    "the new gut scale is expected to be @xmath59 from ref.@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the naive unification of the gauge couplings does not occur in our model , but the cross points of the running of the gauge couplings are not so far each other due to their power - law runnings .",
    "taking this fact into account , the grand unification of the gauge couplings might be realized with the help of the threshold effect at @xmath2 . in this paper",
    ", we will assume such a situation and use the term `` gut '' in this sense .",
    "note that @xmath60 is the same order as @xmath49 .",
    "this suggests that @xmath16 obtains the vev at @xmath2 .",
    "it seems quite natural for @xmath16 to acquire the vev at @xmath2 because at the same scale some scalar fields obtain non - zero vevs and break the gut gauge group into the standard model group : @xmath61 .",
    "we will assume that the bulk scalar fields @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 have complex vevs at @xmath2 and thus cp is violated spontaneously .",
    "the effective @xmath62-terms are generated after the bulk scalars obtain the vevs .",
    "@xmath63 where @xmath64 are dimensionless @xmath56 real couplings .",
    "from now on , we will set @xmath49 to real by using the @xmath3 symmetry and assume that @xmath65  tev . in this case , @xmath66 so the weak - scale @xmath62-parameters are generated .    as a result ,",
    "the @xmath62-terms of the superpotential have the following structure .",
    "@xmath67 where @xmath68 are weak - scale order and real , and the phases @xmath69 and @xmath70 are of order one .",
    "the value of @xmath71 is determined later .",
    "we will apply the scherk - schwarz mechanism @xcite to break the supersymmetry . in this case",
    "the susy breaking scale is identified with the compactification scale @xmath37 . according to the charge assignment of the r - parity ,",
    "the particles have the following masses below the susy breaking scale @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "( i ) sm particles ( except higgs bosons ) : : :    massless ( ii ) higgs bosons : : :    obtain masses through one - loop ( iii ) gaugino , @xmath72 and @xmath73 : : :    @xmath74 ( @xmath75  tev ) ( iv ) the other sfermions : : :    @xmath76    ( several hundred gev )    where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the scalar components of @xmath77 and @xmath78 respectively .",
    "the mass ( squared ) matrices of the sfermions satisfy the degeneracy and proportionality conditions , which are required to suppress the dangerous fcnc @xcite .",
    "in particular , the mass parameters in the higgs sector are @xmath79 thus the higgs potential @xmath80 has the following structure , @xmath81 where @xmath82 represents the d - term and @xmath83 and @xmath84 are about @xmath85 . here",
    "@xmath84 are complex and their phases can not be removed by the redefinition of the higgs fields and one phase is left . in the mssm or the nmssm ,",
    "all the phases of the higgs mass parameters can be absorbed by field redefinitions and thus scpv can not occur without the appearance of a too light higgs boson @xcite .",
    "this is the reason for our model to be the minimal scpv model .",
    "these situations are the same as in ref.@xcite and as discussed there the potential eq.([pottl ] ) has the vacuum with the following structure .",
    "@xmath86    here we have taken the basis on which @xmath87 and @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are real @xcite . on this basis , yukawa couplings are @xmath91 the hierarchical structure does not change by these field redefinitions .",
    "thus the ckm matrix is real up to @xmath92 .",
    "the cp - violation parameter @xmath93 can be written in terms of the mass matrix element of the neutral k meson in the @xmath94-@xmath95 basis @xmath96 , @xmath97    the dominant contribution to @xmath98 can come from the standard box diagram and the tree - level diagram with the neutral - higgs exchange depicted in fig .",
    "[ boxdgm ] and fig .",
    "[ hgsex ] .    the contribution of fig .",
    "[ boxdgm ] is calculated as follows @xcite .    @xmath99    where @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the masses of the c quark , w boson and the k meson respectively , and @xmath103 and @xmath69 are the fermi constant and the fine structure constant .",
    "@xmath104 and @xmath105 are the weinberg angle and the cabibbo angle respectively .    on the other hand , the contribution of fig .",
    "[ hgsex ] is calculated as @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the neutral higgs mass .",
    "then , @xmath108    according to ref.@xcite , @xmath109 and we obtain @xmath110    here we have assumed that @xmath111  gev . if we set @xmath112  tev , @xmath113 and thus @xmath114 .",
    "in such a case , the value of @xmath93 becomes too large .",
    "then we will assume @xmath115  tev .",
    "in this case , @xmath116 and we obtain @xmath117 . therefore @xmath98 is dominated by the box diagram .    on the contrary",
    ", the main contribution to @xmath118 comes from the fig .",
    "[ hgsex ] since the km phase is greatly suppressed by the factor @xmath92 while the `` extra '' yukawa couplings @xmath119 have arbitrary phases .",
    "hence we can estimate the absolute value of @xmath93 at @xmath120    taking into account the fact that there are @xmath56 ambiguity in the hierarchical structure of the yukawa matrices and the mixing among the neutral higgs fields , we can conclude that the above value of @xmath93 has an ambiguity about one order of magnitude .",
    "as a result , we can estimate the value of @xmath93 at @xmath121 and this is consistent with the experimental value .",
    "next we will consider the value of @xmath122 .",
    "@xmath123 can be written as @xcite @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the decay amplitude of a @xmath126 into two pions of isospin @xmath11 and @xmath127 from the experiments .",
    "the candidates of the main contributions to @xmath128 are the standard penguin diagram , the penguin diagrams with chargino and stop and tree - level diagrams with charged higgs .",
    "when the charged higgs is relatively light , for example @xmath129  gev , the third - type diagrams give the main contribution . according to ref.@xcite , @xmath122 can be estimated at around @xmath130 in the case of @xmath131  tev",
    ". then we can estimate @xmath132 with @xmath129  gev .",
    "this value is also consistent with the experimental value .",
    "for the same reason as discussed in @xcite , the values of the electric dipole moments ( edm ) of the neutron and the electron are below and close to the experimental upper bounds in our model .",
    "finally , we will comment that all the cp asymmetries in the b decays are small enough to be neglected because the km phase and the phases of the `` standard '' yukawa couplings are of order @xmath92 , and the `` extra '' yukawa couplings and the vevs of the `` extra '' higgs fields are both suppressed by @xmath133 .",
    "in our model , it does not seem that the see - saw mechanism can be applied at first sight since the fundamental scale @xmath0 ( @xmath134  tev ) is much lower than the scale required in the usual see - saw mechanism .",
    "however , the volume factor suppression enables the neutrinos to have the desirable small masses .",
    "suppose that the right - handed neutrinos @xmath135 ( @xmath136 ) are the bulk fields propagating into the extra dimension .",
    "then the neutrino yukawa couplings @xmath137 are suppressed by the volume factor : @xmath138 .",
    "therefore it is possible to obtain the small neutrino masses of order ev range even in the case that the majorana mass scale of the right - handed neutrinos @xmath139 is around the low fundamental scale @xmath43  tev .",
    "for example , if we assume @xmath135 not to have the @xmath3 charges , we can estimate the dirac mass of the neutrino at @xmath140 where @xmath141  gev .",
    "this is consistent with the value of the mass of @xmath142 estimated from the neutrino - oscillation experiments .",
    "further , we can gain more suppression by assigning non - zero @xmath3 charges to @xmath135 .",
    "we have a nambu - goldstone ( ng ) boson associated with the breaking of the @xmath3 symmetry since @xmath16 and @xmath17 have vevs at @xmath2 .",
    "is anomalous . ]",
    "this ng boson will behave like an axion , which can set the @xmath143-parameter to be zero at low energy .",
    "the axion field @xmath144 couples to the quarks and leptons such as @xmath145 where @xmath146 is a dimensionless @xmath56 coupling and @xmath147 is the u - quark field .",
    "since @xmath148  gev here , this coupling seems too strong to realize an invisible axion .",
    "then we will introduce a new extra dimension whose radius is denoted by @xmath149 and new fields @xmath150 and @xmath151 that feel this new dimension .",
    "to illustrate the situation , let us consider the toy model with the couplings such as @xmath152 and @xmath153 , where @xmath154 and @xmath155 are dimensionless couplings and @xmath156 denotes the quark field , and the bulk fields @xmath150 and @xmath151 couple to only @xmath144 .",
    "then the renormalization group equation ( rge ) of @xmath154 is @xcite @xmath157    solving this equation , @xmath158    if we will set @xmath159 , i.e. , @xmath160  mev and @xmath161 , we can obtain greatly suppressed coupling at low energy @xmath162 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the rge of @xmath155 is @xmath163 where @xmath164 and @xmath165 are @xmath56 constants and @xmath166 is the electro - magnetic gauge coupling .",
    "we have neglected the terms involving small yukawa couplings .    solving this equation , @xmath167 where @xmath168 is a constant determined by the initial condition .    in the case of @xmath169",
    ", we will obtain very small coupling @xmath170 .",
    "this suppression of @xmath155 comes from the power - law running of the field renormalization factor of @xmath144 @xcite .",
    "thus the axion - quark coupling in our model @xmath146 can receive the similar suppression and make the axion invisible at low energy .",
    "our model becomes a supersymmetric 4-higgs - doublet ( 4hd ) standard model below the compactification scale @xmath37 , so the lightest higgs boson must be lighter than 130  gev , which is the same upper bound as the mssm case @xcite . note that there is no large contribution to the higgs mass bound coming from the existence of the `` extra '' higgs particles appearing at two - loop level discussed in ref.@xcite in spite of the low cut - off scale @xmath0 .",
    "this is because the `` extra '' yukawa couplings are suppressed by @xmath133 in our model .",
    "here we considered the minimal susy model in which the fermion mass hierarchy is realized by an abelian flavor symmetry @xmath3 and the smallness of the cp violation is controlled by the spontaneous cp violation in the context of the large extra dimensions . in our model various physical scales such as the symmetry breaking scales of @xmath3 , @xmath4-parity that guarantees the natural flavor conservation in the higgs sector , cp symmetry and peccei - quinn symmetry that is identified with @xmath3 are unified into the same scale ( @xmath171  tev ) , at which the grand unification of the gauge couplings might be occur .",
    "this is a quite attractive feature that should be possessed by the theory beyond the standard model . in models with the low fundamental scale @xmath0 like theories with large extra dimensions",
    ", one must explain various phenomenological problems only with scales that is below @xmath0 .",
    "our model satisfies this requirement .",
    "furthermore , the strong cp problem can be solved by the presence of the ng boson associated with the @xmath3 breaking , which is regarded as the axion and can be made invisible by introducing a new large extra dimension and new fields which couple to only the axion and feel this new dimension .    finally , we comment about the hierarchy between the large vevs of @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( @xmath171  tev ) and the small vevs of the higgs fields ( @xmath171  gev ) .",
    "it is naturally understood by the fact that the physics on the boundary can be regarded as the fluctuation of the physics in the bulk and thus vevs induced on the boundary are generically much smaller than vevs in the bulk ."
