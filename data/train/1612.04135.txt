    "ernest rutherford s discovery of alpha particle is an incredible milestone in the realm of nuclear physics .",
    "it has opened new frontiers of research for full fledged study of alpha decay phenomena .",
    "equally praiseworthy were the discoveries of exotic nuclei including heavy and superheavy nuclei with proton number as large as @xmath4 .",
    "since then @xmath1-decay has become a topic of intense research and has gained an extraordinary amount of attention for the calculation of half - lives and q - values .",
    "earlier findings of decay half - lives have lent support to many theoretical studies namely the relativistic mean field theory , the density dependent m@xmath5y ( ddm@xmath5y ) interaction and the skyrme - hartree - fock mean field model @xcite .",
    "the whole process of decay of @xmath1-particle from a parent nucleus can be considered as a quantal two body problem comprising of the daughter and the emitted @xmath1-particle @xcite . indeed , a suitable @xmath1+daughter nucleus potential can be formulated and its features can be elucidated .",
    "the potential chosen can be either phenomenological ( eg . woods - saxon ( ws ) shape with adjustable parameters , ginnochio shape etc . ) or it can be formed microscopically by double folding models @xcite .    amongst many of the potentials used so far ,",
    "ginocchio potential and wood - saxon potentials are the two potentials that have been extensively studied for @xmath1-decay half - lives .",
    "although the ginocchio potential is analytically solvable , highly versatile and correctly represent diffuseness still the searching of resonance pole of s - matrix in this case is tedious . on the other hand , searching of poles in wood - saxon potential",
    "though simple , the potential is not analytically solvable .",
    "therefore , we search for a potential which is analytically solvable and the tracing of poles of the s - matrix is quite easy to estimate the alpha decay half - lives of various exotic nuclei from these poles .    we develop a versatile and analytically solvable potential which fairly reproduces the combined potential of an @xmath1+nucleus system resulting from both the attractive nuclear and repulsive electrostatic potentials .",
    "this potential was used originally by fiedeldey and frahn @xcite .",
    "we have designed a similar potential [ fig .",
    "@xmath6 sans any imaginary part involved . by ascertaining all the parameters ,",
    "this potential is capable of generating quantal or quasi molecular state and we can easily incorporate @xmath1-decay process to this quasi molecular decay path .",
    "many a times wkb method has been applied to get the energies of long - lived states of the effective potential .",
    "this semi - classical approximation yields the probability of decay of @xmath1+daughter nucleus system together with the decay constant .",
    "furthermore , the found out decay constant can be used to get the half - lives . however , this method has serious problems concerning the frequency factor @xcite .",
    "hence , we sort to an alternative method of finding the half - life by considering the quantum scattering theory where resonance states can be found from the @xmath1+daughter nucleus two body system .",
    "s - matrix theory of potential scattering is used to get the resonance energy .",
    "the resonance states are described as poles of the s - matrix falling in the fourth quadrant of the complex - momentum plane .",
    "we are therefore left with the complex pole positions which in turn gives both energy and width of the resonance state @xcite .    in the present paper , to begin with we develop a potential totally apt for describing the coulomb nuclear potential of the @xmath1+nucleus system . our preferred potential in simple term is a merger of an attractive nuclear part and a repulsive coulomb part .",
    "this merged potential shows a pocket followed by a barrier in its radial variation .",
    "we specify the parameters for the depth of the pocket , height and position of the barrier and the steepness of the potential in the interior side . with this potential ,",
    "schrdinger equation is solved exactly . by matching the wave function and its derivative with the regular coulomb wave function @xmath2 and irregular coulomb wave function @xmath3 , for partial wave @xmath7",
    ", the s - matrix is expressed as a function of the incident energy . in the complex energy or momentum plane ,",
    "the poles of s - matrix in the fourth quadrant of the momentum plane gives the energy of resonance as well as the width .",
    "subsequently , the width gives the decay time .",
    "the above mentioned formulation is applied to a wide range of @xmath1+nucleus systems including light to heavy to superheavy nuclei for finding out the resonance states and their decay rates . throughout the paper ,",
    "we maintain uniformity by changing the value of the parameter @xmath8 which specifically determines the steepness of the inner side of the potential barrier . by doing so ,",
    "a clear comparison and correlation is done in all the systems considered in the calculation .",
    "it is shown that the range of @xmath8 is @xmath9 .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way .",
    "section ii concerns with the formulation of the potential .",
    "the experimental results are presented in section iii .",
    "summary and conclusions are confronted in section iv .",
    "hg system.,title=\"fig : \" ] [ fig.1 ]",
    "we suggest a potential to be a function of radial variable r , which is of the form @xmath10 & { \\hspace{4mm}if\\;\\;\\ ; r \\le r_0,}\\\\ v_0s_2\\rho _ 2 & { \\hspace{4mm}if\\;\\;\\ ; r \\ge r_0 , } \\end{array } \\right .\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the strength of the potential with value @xmath12 mev .",
    "@xmath13 @xmath14 accounts for the flatness of the barrier , @xmath8 deciding the steepness of the interior side of the barrier whereas the exterior side is judged by @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 is the radial position having value ; @xmath17 , @xmath18 fm . since we are considering the @xmath1+nucleus system , @xmath19 and @xmath20 represent the mass and proton number of @xmath1 particle , @xmath21 and @xmath22 represent the mass and proton number of the daughter nucleus .",

    ", we obtain the s - matrix as @xmath54 where @xmath55 the resonance energy is obtained from the poles of s - matrix in the complex momentum plane . from a resonant pole of the s - matrix expressed by @xmath56 we obtain the resonance energy ( q value ) @xmath57 and width @xmath58 the time of decay is related to the width as @xmath59",
    "we now apply the formulation as described in section @xmath60 by taking a potential apt for justifying the @xmath1+nucleus system . this potential must be compatible with the relativistic mean field theory .",
    "for @xmath61hg system we reproduce the same potential with our analytically solvable potential expressed by ( 1 ) by assigning the values of the parameters @xmath62 fm , @xmath63 mev , @xmath64 mev , @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",
    "this potential for the system is shown in fig .",
    "1 . using this potential we obtain the resonance energy , q - value and the half - life from the resonant pole of s - matrix given by ( 10 ) .",
    "we now sagaciously change the values of the potential parameter @xmath8 and apply the same potential formulation to a wide range of systems spanning the light , heavy and superheavy nuclei to get the half lives ready for close comparison with the corresponding experimental values . for good agreement of the experimental values",
    "we keep all the parameters except changing one parameter concerning the steepness of the potential barrier in the interior side .",
    "keen observation on the outcome reveal that the value of @xmath8 deviate in the range @xmath67 to @xmath68 .    for a given system we vary the value of @xmath8 and locate a pole to keep the energy equal to the experimental q - value .",
    "the width of this pole gives us the @xmath69 through ( 14 ) and we represent this by @xmath70 .",
    "we now jot the trio i.e @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 in table 1 and table 2 for a wide range of @xmath1+nucleus systems .",
    "the results in table 1 and table 2 show that for the whole range of @xmath1-decaying nuclei system the experimental and calculated half - lives closely match .",
    "we also confirm the close agreement for the case of different isotopes of po nucleus which is shown in fig .",
    "3 .    we hand - pick a group of systems by going down the tabulation ( i.e @xmath74 sm , @xmath75gd , @xmath76dy , @xmath77pt , @xmath78pb , @xmath79ra , @xmath80th , @xmath81u , @xmath82pu , @xmath83 cm ) .",
    "a glimpse on the results of the systems affirms that they have very large experimental decay time , @xmath84 .",
    "let us consider the case of @xmath74sm for which @xmath85 s. our calculated value of @xmath86 s which is very close to the above experimental value .",

    "an analytical expression for a potential is developed to simulate the combined effect of the attractive nuclear and repulsive electrostatic force .",
