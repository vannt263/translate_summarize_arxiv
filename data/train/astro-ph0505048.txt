    "numerous studies of dwarf ellipticals ( des ) have put the homogeneity of this class of galaxy in question . in particular ,",
    "the two main subclasses , nucleated and non - nucleated des ( dens and denons ) , might have a different history : dens are more strongly clustered , are brighter , and have been claimed to show redder colours ( binggeli & cameron 1991 ; rakos et al .",
    "2004 ) . to explore the differences and similarities of these galaxies in greater detail ,",
    "we study here the fundamental relation of des  the colour - magnitude relation ( cmr )  separately for dens and denons .",
    "this requires a large and homogeneous de sample which ideally should also enable us to address the issue of a possible transition from dwarf to giant ellipticals ( es ) .",
    "contrary to the earlier belief , it has been shown recently that the structural parameters of des and es exhibit a smooth transition ( graham & guzman 2003 ) , raising the question whether this is also the case for their colour properties .",
    "the sdss data release 3 provides reduced and calibrated images in the u , g , r , i , and z band as well as photometric measurements for virgo cluster galaxies . however , low surface brightness objects like the des can be shredded , i.e.  parts of them are assigned to multiple separate source detections by the detection algorithm , resulting in unreliable photometry . a comparison with the work of gavazzi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) showed that we must restrict ourselves to des brighter than @xmath3 that are already listed in the virgo cluster catalog ( vcc ; binggeli et al .",
    "1985 ) and carefully exclude misaligned or shredded source detections visually . moreover , the sdss photometric pipeline overestimates the local sky flux due to the large apparent object sizes , for which we apply an appropriate correction .",
    "our final sample comprises 220 des+ds0s ; the sample of 8 giant ellipticals was selected in the same manner .",
    "colours for the dwarfs were derived from aperture photometry on the sdss images , excluding the inner @xmath4 to avoid nucleus light entering the aperture . since this does not require any photometric measurements from the sdss pipeline , our sample",
    "is extended to 349 des+ds0s in diagrams where only colours are required .",
    "errors were estimated from the signal - to - noise ratio and the uncertainty of the sky flux correction .",
    "galactic extinction corrections are provided by the sdss database .",
    "the classification of several dwarfs as ds0 in the vcc had been based on the two - dimensional appearance of the galaxies rather than on their azimuthally averaged profiles  the latter are indistinguishable from those of the des ( binggeli & cameron 1991 ) .",
    "consequently , the existence of a separate class of ds0 galaxies has been questioned : ryden et al.(1999 ) conclude that there are no compelling arguments for it , and e.g.barazza et al .",
    "( 2003 ) subsume des and ds0s into one class .",
    "we demonstrate the danger of this approach in fig .  1 , where we show the cmr separately for dens and denons , treating ds0s as des in the middle panel but separating them in the right panel .",
    "from the middle panel one would conclude that the cmr of denons shows a steeper slope than the one of dens , whereas the right panel reveals only a slight tendency towards bluer colours of denons compared to dens , also given the paucity of bright denons .",
    "here and in the following figures colour is measured within the half - light radius ; the left panel of fig .",
    "1 confirms that no significant difference appears when using fixed apertures instead .",
    "the cmr of dens is tight and does not broaden towards fainter magnitudes , as opposed to the findings of previous studies of des ( e.g.  conselice et al .",
    "note that the increase in colour errors by more than a factor of two would require any significant broadening to be larger than that , which is not the case .",
    "we extend the cmr to faint es in fig .  2 , illustrating that there is a smooth transition from des to es which is mainly populated by dens .",
    "the left panel shows the positions of various types of galaxy and demonstrates that compact faint m32-like ellipticals neither belong to the e nor to the de class but define their own colour - magnitude region instead . in the middle panel we show that the es basically follow the linear extension of the cmr of dens as derived from a least - squares fit .",
    "however , a study of nearby es in the sdss by chang et al .",
    "( 2005 ) finds a steeper slope which is well constrained for magnitudes @xmath5 and indicates a slope change at about this magnitude . in the right panel we focus on the cmr of denons in order to see whether or not they follow the relation defined by dens and es .",
    "unfortunately the small number of bright denons prevents any definite conclusion  despite a weak tendency towards bluer colours the denons are not inconsistent with the slope defined by the dens .",
    "a rough age and metallicity distribution of our sample can be obtained through a multicolour comparison of the observations with population synthesis models from bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) , as shown in fig.3 .",
    "since the range of values for @xmath6 is rather small , we select only objects brighter than @xmath7 to avoid large errors that would dilute the comparison .",
    "brighter objects tend to be redder because of the cmr ( left panel of fig .",
    "3 ) , therefore the colours can only be explained with a decrease in metallicity towards fainter magnitudes ( right panel ) , consistent with previous studies .",
    "young ages ( @xmath8 ) are clearly ruled out , and for the dens the data is consistent with ages @xmath9 .",
    "however , we can not exclude a possible relation of age and luminosity _ on top _ of the dominant luminosity - metallicity relation ; moreover , the trend of denons showing bluer colours appears to be strongest in @xmath10 , possibly indicating younger ages than for the dens .",
    "our large sample of virgo cluster des+ds0s from the sdss shows that dens follow a tight cmr down to @xmath11 without any significant broadening in colour .",
    "the faint es follow the cmr defined by dens , but a change in slope occurs at @xmath1 . after excluding ds0 galaxies , only a weak trend towards bluer colours of denons compared to dens is found .",
    "the colours of the brighter des rule out young ages ( @xmath12 ) and the dens are consistent with ages @xmath13 ."

    "<S> a colour analysis of a carefully selected sample of over 200 virgo cluster des and 8 giant ellipticals ( es ) in the sdss yields the following results : a ) the nucleated des ( dens ) follow a tight colour - magnitude relation ( cmr ) which does not broaden significantly at fainter ( @xmath0 ) magnitudes , b ) the cmr of dens smoothly transitions to the cmr of es , but the latter changes its slope at about @xmath1 , c ) the brighter dens are consistent with ages of @xmath2 and a decrease of metallicity towards fainter magnitudes , but a possible additional luminosity - age relation is not ruled out , d ) it is crucial to treat ds0s separately from des since their different colour properties would otherwise bias the comparison of nucleated and non - nucleated des ( denons ) , e ) the denons show a weak trend towards bluer colours than dens . </S>"
