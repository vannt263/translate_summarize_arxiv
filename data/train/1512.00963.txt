    "instabilities of stratified shear flows are important for understanding not only geophysical phenomena but also fundamental mechanisms of flow instabilities .",
    "the couplings among vortical waves and gravity waves , which are induced by the ambient shear flow , give rise to various types of instabilities named after kelvin , helmholtz , holmboe , and taylor ( see the review  @xcite ) . by replacing gravity by centrifugal force",
    ", the analogous mechanism further triggers instabilities of swirling flows and vortices .",
    "the above instabilities have been described most clearly by assuming staircase profiles of the ambient vorticity and density , which enables one to interpret the instabilities in terms of the couplings of a finite number of discrete eigenmodes  @xcite .",
    "slightly - smoothed staircase profiles are studied approximately by using matched asymptotic expansions  @xcite .",
    "however , it is generally difficult to predict and interpret the instabilities of continuous profiles because the stable disturbances occupy a continuous spectrum  @xcite . since the corresponding eigenvalue problem , called the taylor - goldstein equation , is non - self - adjoint and singular , the accurate stability boundary is often hard to determine both analytically and numerically . the classical miles - howard criterion  @xcite states that the stratified shear flow is stable if the local richardson number @xmath0 is greater than @xmath1 everywhere .",
    "although many theoretical investigations have been made concerning various situations where @xmath2 somewhere ( see @xcite and references therein ) , a general stability criterion for smooth profiles does not appear to be in the literature .",
    "however , a generalized version of rayleigh - fjrtoft criterion is found when @xmath3 everywhere in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we will present an efficient method for finding marginally unstable modes in the case of @xmath4 everywhere . following this method",
    ", we will further obtain new sufficient conditions for stability .",
    "we consider the linear stability of parallel shear flow @xmath5 in an inviscid , incompressible fluid of variable density @xmath6 on a domain @xmath7 bounded by two walls at @xmath8 , where the gravitational acceleration @xmath9 acts in the @xmath10 direction . by introducing the stream function of the disturbance as @xmath11 with a complex phase speed @xmath12 and a ( real ) wavenumber @xmath13",
    ", stability is governed by the taylor - goldstein ( tg ) equation : @xmath14 where the prime ( @xmath15 ) indicates the @xmath16 derivative and the boussinesq approximation [ @xmath17 where @xmath18 has been used ; @xmath19 is the brunt - visl ( or buoyancy ) frequency .",
    "if this equation has a nontrivial solution for @xmath20 with a positive imaginary part , @xmath21 , the shear flow is spectrally unstable . in what follows",
    ", we assume a strictly increasing shear flow and a stably stratified density ; @xmath22,\\label{assumption}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that the local richardson number @xmath23 is positive everywhere .",
    "( strictly decreasing shear flows @xmath24 can be treated similarly by replacing @xmath25 by @xmath26 in the tg equation .",
    "in fact , a flow @xmath25 is stable if and only if @xmath26 is so . )",
    "stability boundaries are often studied by searching for marginally unstable eigenmodes with @xmath27 ( where @xmath28 ) , which were called singular neutral modes by miles  @xcite because the tg equation becomes singular at the critical layer @xmath29 satisfying @xmath30 .",
    "miles proved that a singular neutral mode may exist only when @xmath31 and only in the form of either @xmath32 or @xmath33 ( see the results viii and ix of @xcite ) , where @xmath34 with the sign of @xmath35 delineating the two linearly independent solutions obtained by the frobenius method . specifically , the singularity of has the following branch cuts extending to infinity , @xmath36,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the heaviside function , and @xmath38 are real analytic functions satisfying @xmath39 as well as the boundary condition @xmath40 .",
    "thus , the existence of the domain @xmath41:j_r(x)\\le1/4\\}$ ] is necessary for instability , in that the singular neutral modes must have the critical layers on it . since @xmath42 for @xmath43",
    ", we will refer to the less singular mode @xmath44 as the `` small '' neutral mode , and @xmath45 as the `` large '' neutral mode ( following the terminology of ideal mhd stability theory ) .",
    "notice that these two types of neutral modes degenerate to @xmath46 only when @xmath47 ( which usually occurs when @xmath29 is an endpoint of @xmath48 ) .",
    "for later use , we also define @xmath49:j_r(x)<1/4\\}$ ] by omitting such the endpoints .    in order to find these singular neutral modes efficiently ,",
    "we first apply a transformation @xmath50 to the tg equation  @xcite and obtain , for @xmath51 , @xmath52 where @xmath53,\\\\   q(x , x_c)= & \\left(\\frac{1}{2}+\\nu_c\\right)\\frac{u''}{u - c}-u'^2\\frac{j_r - j_r(x_c)}{(u - c)^2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because @xmath54 and @xmath55 are integrable functions for given @xmath56 , this transformed equation is considered to be a _ regular _ sturm - liouville equation  @xcite , and hence @xmath57 and @xmath58 are continuous including the point @xmath59 .",
    "moreover , we note from that the small and large neutral modes , respectively , satisfy @xmath60 and @xmath61 at the critical layer @xmath62 .",
    "base on this fact , we divide the domain into @xmath63 $ ] and @xmath64 $ ] , and seek the small and large solutions on each side as follows . by introducing the operator , @xmath65 that depends on the parameter @xmath66",
    ", we solve @xmath67 on @xmath63 $ ] and @xmath68 on @xmath64 $ ] . because each of - is a regular sturm - liouville problem with either dirichlet or neumann boundary condition at @xmath59 , sturm s oscillation theorem  @xcite guarantees that the eigenvalues can be ordered as follows .",
    "@xmath69 where the superscript @xmath70 indicates the @xmath71th largest eigenvalue . here",
    ", only a finite number of positive eigenvalues is of our interest ( since @xmath66 ) and these eigenvalues depend on @xmath62 continuously .",
    "again at the endpoints @xmath72 ( namely , @xmath47 ) , the degeneracy , @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) , must occur .",
    "if the matching condition @xmath76 between the left and right domains is satisfied for a specific @xmath43 , there is a large neutral mode @xmath77 for such @xmath30 and @xmath78 .",
    "similarly , there exists a small neutral mode @xmath79 if @xmath80 occurs for a specific @xmath43 .     and",
    "@xmath81 , @xmath75 , as functions of @xmath43 for the examples of unstable flows ( i)-(iii).,width=226 ]    we have applied this approach numerically to the following three examples :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ \\(i ) @xmath82 , @xmath83 ,    \\(ii ) @xmath84 , @xmath85 ,    \\(iii ) @xmath82 , @xmath86 , _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    on the common domain @xmath87=[-1,1]$ ] . the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ unstable_flows](i)-(iii ) , where the shaded areas indicate the exterior of @xmath48 .",
    "several large and small neutral modes are found , respectively , as indicated by the open and filled circle symbols in fig .",
    "[ unstable_flows ] .",
    "we have confirmed that unstable modes indeed exist between these points along the black solid lines .",
    "the flows ( i)-(iii ) are respectively unstable to the kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) , taylor ( t ) and holmboe ( h ) instabilities as indicated in fig .",
    "[ unstable_flows ] . for the case ( i )",
    ", the stratification induces three more unstable modes in addition to the kh instability that originally exists in the mixing layer .",
    "as exemplified by these modes as well as the taylor instability ( ii ) , increasing the stratification ( or @xmath88 ) generally tends to spawn more unstable modes , whose eigenfunctions are more oscillatory ( i.e. , @xmath89 and @xmath81 with larger @xmath71 show up on the positive side ) .",
    "at the same time , however , the width of @xmath48 tends to be narrowed by increasing @xmath88 , which in turn contributes to stabilization . in the case ( iii ) , @xmath48 is divided into two parts by the sharply peaked profile of @xmath88 ( or density jump ) and the kh mode is split into the holmboe modes . here",
    ", it should be noted that the unstable modes may exist outside @xmath48 while the neutral modes are forced to exist inside @xmath48 .",
    "now , we recall that howard  @xcite has obtained the upper bound of @xmath90 as @xmath91}\\sqrt{u'^2/4-n_b^2}$ ] , which implies @xmath92 as @xmath93 . on the other hand , we have shown the absence of neutral modes for sufficiently large wavenumber @xmath94 satisfying either @xmath95 or @xmath96 for all @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , no unstable mode can exist for such large @xmath94 .",
    "since the largest eigenvalues , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , of the sturm - liouville problem are easily calculated by the variational method , we can derive a stability condition in the following form .",
    "the flow is spectrally stable for the wavenumber @xmath94 that satisfies either @xmath99 for all @xmath43 .",
    "obviously , the flow is spectrally stable for all @xmath94 if the right hand sides of and are negative for all @xmath100 and for all @xmath101 , respectively , and @xmath102 ( namely , @xmath97 and @xmath98 are negative on @xmath103 and @xmath104 , respectively ) .",
    "note that either @xmath103 or @xmath104 may be the null set and then or will be not applicable .",
    "if @xmath105 both on @xmath63 $ ] for all @xmath100 and on @xmath64 $ ] for all @xmath101 , criterion 1 immediately proves stability .",
    "this observation enables us to derive further stability conditions as follows .",
    "let @xmath106 $ ] be the rightmost point in @xmath103 , i.e. , @xmath107 . by using the inequality @xmath108}\\frac{j_r'}{u ' } \\quad\\mbox{for } x\\le x_c\\le a,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we get @xmath109}\\frac{j_r'}{u ' } \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on @xmath63\\subset[-l , a]$ ] .",
    "the requirement @xmath105 on @xmath63 $ ] for all @xmath100 ( for which @xmath42 ) leads to below . the similar inequality can be also derived for @xmath64\\subset[b , l]$ ] in terms of the leftmost point @xmath110 in @xmath104 .",
    "thus , we obtain the following stability criterion :    the flow is spectrally stable if there exist @xmath111 $ ] such that @xmath112\\atop\\sigma=1/2,1}\\left(\\sigma\\frac{u''}{u'^2}\\right)\\le\\min_{[-l , a]}\\left(\\frac{j_r'}{u'}\\right),\\label{ma}\\\\   \\min_{[b , l]\\atop\\sigma=1/2,1}\\left(\\sigma\\frac{u''}{u'^2}\\right)\\ge\\max_{[b , l]}\\left(\\frac{j_r'}{u'}\\right),\\label{mb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath113\\cup[b , l]$ ] hold , where or may be omitted when @xmath114 or @xmath115 , respectively .",
    "we remark that , in , for example , we should adopt @xmath116 if @xmath117}u''<0 $ ] , or @xmath118 otherwise .    from criterion 2 , it is straightforward to obtain the next criterion :    the flow is spectrally stable if there exist @xmath111 $ ] such that @xmath119 $ , } \\label{a}\\\\   \\mbox{$u''\\ge0 $ and $ j_r'\\le0 $ on $ [ b , l]$ , } \\label{b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath120\\cup[b , l]$ ] hold , where or may be omitted when @xmath114 or @xmath115 , respectively .",
    "recall that _",
    "unstratified _ shear flows with no inflection point ( @xmath121 ) were shown to be stable by rayleigh  @xcite , and even when a monotonic shear flow ( @xmath122 ) has one inflection point @xmath123 , it is still stable if @xmath124 on @xmath125 $ ] and @xmath126 on @xmath127 $ ] according to fjrtoft  @xcite . criterion 3 asserts that these flows remain stable even with the effect of stratification , if the additional condition on the sign of @xmath128 is satisfied ( where @xmath129 is chosen for the fjrtoft case ) .    since @xmath130 is equivalent to @xmath131 by definition , the case of @xmath132 const .",
    "( or @xmath133 ) automatically satisfies the condition on @xmath128 of criterion 3 . on the contrary , if @xmath0 takes a minimum value in the middle of @xmath87 $ ] and it is below @xmath1 , criterion 3 is violated and such a stratification can destabilize an otherwise stable shear flow , like the taylor instability of fig .",
    "[ unstable_flows](ii ) .",
    "criterion 3 is also violated by a @xmath134 that has a local maximum in the middle of @xmath48 ( i.e. , a local maximum of vorticity ) , which can cause kh instability like the example of fig .",
    "[ unstable_flows](i ) .",
    "the more detailed criterion 2 tells us that this destabilization effect of @xmath135 ( or @xmath128 ) may be suppressed by the stabilization effect of @xmath128 ( or @xmath135 ) .",
    "for example , the flows ,    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ \\(iv ) @xmath136 , @xmath137 ,    \\(v ) @xmath138 , @xmath139 , _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    on @xmath87=[-1,1]$ ] are found to be stable by criterion 2 .",
    "for the case ( iv ) , the sign of @xmath135 violates the rayleigh - fjrtoft criterion and @xmath134 has a maximum in @xmath48 , but the stratification @xmath0 contributes to stabilization so that the inequality with @xmath140 $ ] holds , as shown in fig .",
    "[ stable_flows ] .",
    "conversely , for the case ( v ) , @xmath0 has a minimum that is below @xmath1 , but @xmath126 is large enough to satisfy with @xmath141 $ ] .",
    "in summary , by using the method developed in this letter , we can efficiently find singular neutral modes that are embedded in the continuous spectrum .",
    "the unstable ranges of wavenumber are searched for by solving the regular sturm - liouville problems - for each @xmath43 , which requires less labor than solving the tg equation ( i.e. , a non - self - adjoint eigenvalue problem ) for each @xmath13 directly . with the help of numerical computation , this method will be useful for determining stability boundaries for various flows and understanding their instability mechanisms . based on this method ,",
    "we have derived new stability criteria ( criteria 1,2 , and 3 ) as extensions of the rayleigh - fjrtoft criterion to stratified flows , which are of course improvements of the howard - miles criterion since the local richardson number is allowed to be less than 1/4 ( see fig .",
    "[ venn_diagram ] ) .",
    "we expect that the present approach could yields stability boundaries of non - monotonic shear flows and locally unstratified ( or constant ) densities with additional or different treatments for the singularity .",
    "a few specific examples were investigated in earlier works  @xcite , which in particular suggests that the singularity at the critical layer should be replaced by that of rayleigh s equation when @xmath142 . by making use of the abundant knowledge about rayleigh s equation  @xcite",
