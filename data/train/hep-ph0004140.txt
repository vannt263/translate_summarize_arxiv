    "the higgs boson characterizes the electroweak symmetry breaking underlying the standard model .",
    "its discovery and phenomenology will be of immense importance in clarifying our understanding of this symmetry breaking , as well as in providing vital information as to the nature of beyond - the - standard - model physics .",
    "the two leading hadronic decay modes of a weinberg - salam higgs boson @xmath13 with mass between @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the qcd processes @xmath16 and @xmath17 two gluons @xmath18 .",
    "although the rate for this latter process is known to @xmath2 , such precision incorporates only two non - leading orders of a slowly converging series in the strong coupling . if @xmath19 , for example , the known order - by - order qcd corrections have been calculated @xcite to be @xmath20 .",
    "the work presented here is primarily directed toward obtaining a more precise estimate of the @xmath1 decay rate .",
    "we utilize renormalization - group @xmath21 and asymptotic pad - approximant methods to estimate the full next - order contribution to the underlying correlation function for this process .",
    "such an approach has already been applied to the quark - antiquark scalar - current correlation function underlying the @xmath22 rate @xcite , a calculation we review in section 5 of the present paper .    as in our prior analysis of the two - gluon decay amplitude of a non - standard - model cp - odd higgs field @xcite ,",
    "the approach we take here is to test asymptotic pad - approximant estimates against rg - accessible coefficients within the next - order of perturbation theory .",
    "we show such estimates to be accurate up to relative errors of only a few percent , supporting the credibility of the same approach in estimating the rg-_inaccessible _ coefficient needed to determine the full @xmath0 contribution to the @xmath1 rate .",
    "we operate within the context of @xmath23 expressions for the @xmath1 and @xmath3 rates that explicitly depend on an arbitrary renormalization scale @xmath11 .",
    "it has been argued elsewhere @xcite that asymptotic pad - approximant methods reduce the explicit scale - dependence of perturbative quantities which must ultimately be scale invariant .",
    "we find this to be the case for the @xmath1 rate as well , despite residual scale - sensitivity anticipated from the estimated rg - inaccessible coefficient of the nonlogarithmic @xmath24 term within the next - order correlator .    in section 2",
    ", we demonstrate the explicit rg - invariance of the @xmath1 rate , as calculated in @xcite in the @xmath25 limit .",
    "this rg invariance enables one to calculate all the next - order coefficients @xmath26 of @xmath27 $ ] @xmath28 within the calculated rate ; only the @xmath29 constant term is rg - inaccessible .    in section 3 ,",
    "we review how asymptotic pad - approximant methods may be utilized to estimate this set of next - order coefficients , and demonstrate close agreement with the rg - determinations of section 2 over the range @xmath30 .",
    "the rg - inaccessible coefficient @xmath31 is also estimated over this range of higgs masses and is fitted to its anticipated behaviour as a degree-3 polynomial in @xmath32 $ ] .    in section 4 we examine the residual scale dependence of the pad - improved @xmath1 decay rate , as obtained in section 3 .",
    "although we anticipate a relative scale dependence comparable to @xmath33 , since @xmath31 can not be extracted perturbatively from the rg equation ( to the order we consider ) , we find that the residual scale dependence of the decay rate is a full order of magnitude smaller than this estimate for @xmath11 between 0.3 @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( we assume @xmath36 ) .",
    "consequently , the scale - dependence of the pad - derived term @xmath37 very nearly cancels the scale - dependence anticipated from truncation of the perturbative series for the @xmath1 rate , thereby facilitating the ( nearly ) scale - invariant rate predictions of table 6 .",
    "predictions of the @xmath1 decay rate are tabulated both for the @xmath38 limit , and for the leading - order departures from this limit for appropriate constant and running values for @xmath39 and @xmath35 .",
    "in the concluding section , we review how prior asymptotic pad - approximant estimates of the @xmath2 contribution to the scalar - current correlation function @xcite can be incorporated into the @xmath22 decay rate .",
    "we demonstrate that the resulting next - order contribution , though only 0.01% of the leading term , is somewhat _ larger _ than known @xmath4 power - suppressed contributions @xcite .",
    "consequently , the estimated @xmath2 term enables the @xmath3 rate to be estimated to four significant figure accuracy .",
