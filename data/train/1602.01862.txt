    "the structure of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) can be studied using the lyman-@xmath0 forest , the absorption features due to neutral hydrogen seen in quasar spectra @xcite . besides quasars",

    "the three dimensional correlation function of the lyman-@xmath0 forest on large scales ( up to 100 @xmath7 ) was measured for the first time , using data from the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) data release 9 ( dr9 ) @xcite .",
    "boss has also enabled the first measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations using the forest on even larger scales @xcite .",
    "such bao measurements at z @xmath6 2 with the lyman-@xmath0 forest are currently the only way to put constraints on dark energy at these redshifts .",
    "if the line of sight density is sufficiently high , inversion methods can be utilized in order to directly make three - dimensional maps of the intergalactic medium from collections of 1d spectra @xcite . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have shown that the topological and statistical properties of the igm can be reconstructed accurately even on small scales that correspond to mean line of sight separations of the order of 1 arcmin . in this paper",
    ", we explore how well maps can be made on much larger scales , corresponding to mean quasar angular separations of tens of arc minutes .",
    "our work , focusing on large - scale structure , is therefore complementary to the studies where individual structures like protoclusters and voids in the lyman-@xmath0 forest have been identified @xcite . in a companion paper",
    "@xcite we present maps made from the boss final data release @xcite , which contains such a sample of quasars covering a wide area .",
    "the lyman-@xmath0 forest provides a means of studying the large scale structure in the redshift range @xmath9 . before recent large - scale structure surveys such as boss @xcite , the sky density of known background quasars in this redshift range over most of the sky was of the order of 1 per square degree ( e.g. , from the 2df quasar survey @xcite , and from sdss i and ii @xcite . except for some small areas with higher observed densities of objects ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    "the lyman-@xmath0 forest was treated as a collection of discrete 1d individual quasar sightlines .",
    "recently , however , the increasing number of discovered quasars with suitable redshifts ( @xmath10 ) for ground based study has made it possible to correlate information over large scales in three dimensions .",
    "boss features a high qso density of @xmath11 @xmath12 ( @xmath13 qsos in the redshift range @xmath14 over 10,000 @xmath15 ) .",
    "each qso provides lyman-@xmath0 forest information along a skewer of length @xmath6 400 @xmath7 , and the typical mean separation for spectra in boss is @xmath6 20 comoving @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this is what has enabled clustering statistics of the lyman-@xmath0 forest to be measured in three dimensions as mentioned above . in the future",
    ", one can expect yet higher densities of sightlines and more precise measurements , in view of the fact that even more quasars will be available for analysis ( e.g. , 45 @xmath12 proposed for ms  desi @xcite , see table [ table : threeexps ] ) . in this paper",

    "[ fig : losdensityforexps ] .    at the redshifts",
    "relevant to the work we present here ( @xmath18 24 ) , most of the volume of the igm is in photoionization equilibrium .",
    "the thermal state of the igm is determined by photoionization heating and adiabatic cooling @xcite .",
    "lya forest traces weakly overdense regions at these redshifts @xcite , and so we can use it to study the large scale structure in this diffuse medium .",
    "the igm density fluctuations follow those of the total matter potential , tracing dark matter at large scales ( @xmath19 @xmath7 ) and respond to pressure smoothing on small scales ( @xmath20 @xmath21 ) @xcite .",
    "the lyman-@xmath0 forest is useful for studying large scale structure at high redshift ( @xmath22 ) , in a fashion complementary to galaxy surveys at low redshift .",
    "the redshift range accessible for surveying large samples of the latter is limited by the surface brightness of galaxies scaling as @xmath23 .",
    "the space density of tracer objects in current large - scale maps of the universe above redshift @xmath24 declines rapidly ( e.g. , in the cmass sample of boss dr9 @xcite , the comoving space density is @xmath25 @xmath26 at @xmath27 but falls off rapidly with increasing redshift ) . here we define large - scale maps as those which cover an appreciable fraction of the sky area . at redshifts @xmath10 , quasars are the only tracers that can be used to make such maps , and the space density of objects declines to the order of @xmath28 @xmath26 @xcite . with a mean 3d separation of @xmath29 100 @xmath7 or larger ,",
    "the shot noise in maps made using quasars is extremely high . using absorption lines , for example metal lines , where multiple lines are available for each quasar",
    "offers a way to increase the space density of tracers @xcite .",
    "the lyman-@xmath0 forest , being a continuous field offers a way of reducing the level of noise in maps even further .",
    "when one has saturation in the lyman-@xmath0 forest , the lyman-@xmath8 transition should provide information due to its lower cross section , which makes it a potentially better probe at high overdensities @xcite as high as 10 times the mean density at @xmath30 .",
    "since lyman-@xmath8 absorption occurs at a lower rest wavelength ( 1026  ) , the lyman-@xmath0 forest overlaps the lyman-@xmath8 forest , and so statistical techniques are needed to make use of the lyman-@xmath8 information @xcite . in principle higher order transitions could be used together with the lyman-@xmath0 forest in mapmaking also .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : we first describe the properties of the cosmological hydrodynamic simulation we use and our choices of simulated data samples at redshifts 2 and 3 with varying line of sight densities and noise levels in accordance with current and future sky surveys in  2 . in  3 , we review wiener filtering and how it is used to carry out the recovery the flux field of the igm .",
    "we look at point to point comparisons of true and reconstructed fields in  4.1 , and then provide correlation plots to test the validity of the reconstruction as a function of scale , followed by non - gaussianity analysis via kolmogorov  smirnov tests in the following subsections . in  4.4 , we look for local peaks in the true field and the reconstructed field and examine slice images to make a visual comparison between the true and reconstructed fields . finally , we test the use of an alternative input correlation matrix in the wiener filtering .",
    "we summarize our results in  5 and also provide closing comments .",
    "in order to evaluate the expected performance of map - making reconstruction on lyman-@xmath0 forest data from boss and other observational surveys , we make use of a large hydrodynamic cosmological simulation of the @xmath31cdm model .",
    "we use the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code p  gadget",
    "( see @xcite ) to evolve a distribution of @xmath32 billion particles in a cubical periodic volume of side length 400 @xmath7 .",
    "the simulation cosmological parameters were @xmath33and@xmath34 the mass per particle was @xmath35 @xmath36 ( gas ) and @xmath37 @xmath36 ( dark matter ) .",
    "a gravitational force resolution of 3.25 kpc / h comoving was used .",
    "the power spectrum of the simulation initial conditions was taken from camb @xcite .",
    "the simulation was run with an ultraviolet background radiation field consistent with @xcite .",
    "cooling and star formation were included .",
    "however the latter used a lower density threshold than usual ( for example in @xcite ) so that gas particles are rapidly converted to collisionless gas particles .",
    "this was done to speed up execution of the simulation . as a result",
    "the stellar properties of galaxies in the simulation are not predicted reliably but this has no significant effect on the diffuse igm that gives rise to the lyman-@xmath0 forest .",
    "black hole formation and feedback from stars were also switched off in the simulation .      .los density , sky coverage , targeted lyman-@xmath0 qsos and spectral resolution parameters for three sky surveys . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to look for deviations in the flux pdfs , we use the kolmogorov  smirnov ( ks ) test .",
    "we first compute the mean and the standard deviation @xmath38 of a gaussian fit to the true field .",
    "we construct a cumulative probability distribution from this and compare it to the cumulative probability distributions of the true field and the reconstructions , for various @xmath17 values , redshifts and levels of noise .    with the ks test , we compute quantitative measures of the similarity of the flux pdfs to normal distributions .",
    "the test statistic ( d value ) is the maximum of the difference in the cumulative distribution functions of the particular field being tested and the gaussian .",
    "the closer this value is to 0 , the more likely it is that the data sets are have been drawn from the same distribution .",
    "furthermore , the p value , which is computed from the test statistic , represents the significance level threshold below which the null hypothesis ( that the data sets come from the same distribution ) will be accepted .    when computing the flux pdfs , we would like the data points to be as independent as possible , and so our data points should at least be separated by distances greater than the smoothing scale , because smoothing would correlate the measurements . because of this , we downsample each data set , picking only a @xmath39 grid of values ( i.e. , data points separated by 80 @xmath7 in each direction in the 400 @xmath7 volume ) .",
    "our ks test results are shown in table [ table : kolmogorov - smirnov ] , for different line of sight densities , redshifts and signal to noise ratios .    in all cases for the true field",
    "we find high p values and low d values , which means that the original field was approximately gaussian to start with .",
    "the recovered field also shows the same property as well in table [ table : kolmogorov - smirnov ] , for recovery from data samples with no added noise . when noise was added , however , the reconstructed maps became significantly non ",
    "gaussian , with the p value decreasing as the signal to noise ratio decreased .",
    "furthermore , the fact that the d and p values between samples with different los density are significantly different can be attributed to the fact that the smoothing filter size depends on the los density itself . as we have mentioned above , the noisiest data , which has s / n=1 ,",
    "is significantly worse than the majority of boss data , for example , but the effect of noise in changing the pdf shape of the reconstructed field should still be borne in mind in an analysis of observed data .",
    "searching for local maxima in the reconstructed flux density field offers one means of defining objects and finding them .",
    "such peaks are likely to correspond to the locations of forming clusters or superclusters of galaxies .",
    "the properties of these density maxima can be used to constrain the cosmological model @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of interest to compare the peaks of the reconstructed flux density field with those in the true flux density field in the simulation .",
    "we search for density peaks in the three dimensional volume of the simulation .",
    "density and flux are inversely related , therefore we identify a simulation 3d pixel as a local peak if its flux value is the smallest amongst the 26 neighbouring 3d pixels surrounding it .",
    "as expected , we find that the number density of local peaks is strongly dependent on the smoothing filter size .",
    "we find that for a filter size of 39.6 @xmath40 , appropriate for @xmath41 , we find 9 local peaks in the simulation volume at @xmath42 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : superclusters]a ) , and for a filter size of 17.8 @xmath7 , appropriate for @xmath43 , we find 87 peaks ( fig .",
    "[ fig : superclusters]c ) , where both of these figures are for the true field . furthermore , @xmath42 and @xmath5 data samples have very similar true peak locations for the same filter size .",
    "when noise is added to mimic observational data , we discover 8 local peaks for the real simulation flux field , while the reconstructed field contains 10 local peaks for the data set z2n200sn1 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : superclusters ] we show a comparison between the true field local peaks and those of the reconstructed field .",
    "the number of peaks in both cases match exactly for the three different combinations of @xmath17 and redshift shown .",
    "the positions of the peaks are visually a reasonable match , with better agreement for @xmath42 than @xmath5 .",
    "the structures traced out in the plot with @xmath43 by the reconstructed peaks do seem visually to trace out those in the real peaks .",
    "0.32     0.32     0.32     there is not a one to one correspondence however .",
    "we can quantify the level of agreement by counting the number of peaks in the true field which have a peak in the reconstructed field within one smoothing length .",
    "this is 33.3 per cent for @xmath42 , @xmath44 .",
    "the expectation from randomly positioned peaks with the same number density ( computed using 1000 monte carlo trials ) is 11.5 per cent .",
    "this means that the reconstruction is a factor of 2.89 better than random .",
    "the equivalent measures for @xmath5 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , @xmath43 are 11.1 per cent and 32.1 per cent peaks within 1 smoothing length respectively and factors of 1.13 and 10.4 better than random .",
    "this type of analysis could be potentially extended to look at the structures that are enclosed within isodensity contours .",
    "this would reveal the morphology of the igm on large scales . at the scales we are probing here ( smoothing scales @xmath45 @xmath7 ) , sheet and filament - like topologies are relatively difficult to see ( as we shall see in our visualisations in the next section ) . on smaller scales ,",
    "these characteristics are readily apparent in simulated maps ( e.g. @xcite ) and the first maps made from observational data with these techniques @xcite . the most straightforward cosmological constraints will come from the peak density , and the reconstruction technique does very well : we get perfect agreement between the real and reconstructed fields for noiseless comparison , and for the noisy case ( with z2n200sn1 ) , the number of peaks agrees within 25 per cent .",

    "the three - dimensional datacubes have @xmath46 axes oriented parallel to the line of sight , and @xmath47 and @xmath48 axes perpendicular to it .",
    "the sampling of pixels in a mock data set is therefore different depending on the plot orientation , and this could influence the recovery of structure .",
    "we therefore show two orientations for each plot , one in the @xmath49 plane ( an  x  slice ) and one in the @xmath50 plane ( a  z  slice ) . in our plots",
    "we show the flux contrast in a slice of thickness one grid cell .",
    "as our volumes are 44 cells on a side , this corresponds to a thickness @xmath51 .",
    "we have also seen in section 4.1 that there is a bias in the reconstructed field which leads it to have higher contrast .",
    "changes in @xmath17 and adjusting the correlation lengths do not alter this and so we follow @xcite in applying a bias correction before visualizing the fields .    in figs [ fig :",
    "slices_z2_nonoise_200los ] through [ fig : slices_z3_nonoise_200los ] we present image slices through the simulation volume .",
    "the images show the flux contrast @xmath52 , which means that low values correspond to high values of the matter density .",
    "the red colour shows these higher density regions and white those of lower density .",
    "the image slices are taken from the centre of the cube in directions parallel and perpendicular to the loss . as explained in section 3 ,",
    "the motivation for choosing to display slices through the centre of the cube is because we are not using information about the periodic boundary conditions in the simulation when carrying out the reconstruction .",
    "the edges of each image slice will therefore give an idea of",
    "how well the reconstruction would succeed at the edges of a survey volume .",
    "we have checked other random slices and verified that the reconstruction recovers the general features of the original field , even when close to edges of the simulation volume .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : slices_z2_nonoise_200los ] we can see the results for our lowest density of sightlines ( we have @xmath41 ) , at redshift @xmath42 .",
    "we can see that the general morphology of the field is recognizably similar in the true and reconstructed maps . in detail , the maps have some differences , but the maxima , minima and their gross shapes are fairly well reproduced , and one could therefore expect that observational data from the boss survey ( which has approximately this number density of quasars ) would yield visually quite accurate maps of the large scale structure , at least when smoothed on the relevant filter scale ( a filter of 39.6 @xmath7 was used here . ) .",
    "the top and bottom rows of fig .",
    "[ fig : slices_z2_nonoise_200los ] show results for slices parallel and perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "we see no obvious difference in the fidelity of reconstruction for each , and there is no obvious sign of the discrete sampling of the field by pixels and sightlines ( which is different for the top and bottom rows ) .",
    "general features of the field are recovered well , especially for mildly dense regions .",
    "figs [ fig : slices_z2_noisysnr2_200los ] and [ fig : slices_z2_noisysnr1_200los ] demonstrate the effect of adding uncorrelated gaussian noise to the flux field in order to better mimic observational data , and how the fidelity of the reconstruction changes when noise is introduced . noise levels ( s / n = 1 or 2 ) indicate the amount of noise for a simulation pixel ( @xmath6 0.76 @xmath7 ) wide .",
    "since our pixels are rebinned to @xmath6 9 @xmath7 , the added noise is reduced by a factor of 3.4 .",
    "hence , the difference between the true fields before and after adding noise is small .",
    "however , the reconstruction is sensitive to the amount of noise , therefore the fidelity of the noisy reconstruction is noticeably worse , especially for overdense and underdense regions .",
    "we increase the density of the sightlines in figs [ fig : slices_z2_nonoise_400los ] and [ fig : slices_z2_nonoise_1000los ] . as a result ,",
    "the quality of the reconstruction is visually better . although the reconstruction code does not take into account the periodic boundary conditions of the simulation , the fields are comparable even at the edges",
    "this is likely due to lower smoothing levels , as the smoothing level scales inversely with @xmath17 .",
    "fluctuations in the flux field are greater at higher redshifts .",
    "as figs [ fig : slices_z3_nonoise_60los ] and [ fig : slices_z3_nonoise_200los ] clearly show , this results in a decrease in the fidelity of the reconstruction .",
    "it is obvious that at redshift @xmath5 , the los density of @xmath53 is not good enough to yield a comparable reconstructed field . for observational data , we naturally expect a better map at @xmath42 than at @xmath5 , as the los density is higher at @xmath42 . in this study , although the los density is set to be the same at both redshifts , we get a better recovery of the field at @xmath42 .    furthermore , in fig .",
    "[ fig : randomlos_z2_nonoise200los ] , we show one  dimensional visual comparisons along four lines of sight chosen at random using the data set @xmath54 , whose source density matches the areal los density of boss , and observe that the recovered skewers capture general features of the original ones .",
    "the recovery is accurate for scales larger than @xmath6 @xmath55 , as found in @xcite , especially for mildly dense regions ( standardized correlation plots ) . due to the isotropic nature of the recovery and the smoothing ,",
    "we do not notice any significant statistical difference between the directions parallel to and perpendicular to loss .",
    "as @xmath17 increases , naturally , the recovery gets substantially better .",
    "this means that with future experiments like eboss and ms  desi , which have higher areal density of loss , a very accurate large map of the igm can be generated .    adding noise to our data ( pixel by pixel ) and carrying out the recovery is an important step in order to better simulate real data from experiments .",
    "it is clearly seen from the figures that adding noise makes the recovery of overdense and underdense regions significantly worse .",

    ", we use a simple gaussian form for the correlation function which appears in the wiener interpolation covariance matrix ( equation [ eq : correl_matrix ] ) .",
    "this is motivated by simplicity , and the fact that it is well behaved numerically at large separations .",
    "one might expect covariance matrices computed from the actual correlation functions of the field to give more accurate reconstruction results , however , and we now test this .    in @xcite , the three - dimensional correlation function of the absorption in the lyman-@xmath0 forest was measured for the first time .",
    "the measurement was extended to greater than @xmath56 scales by @xcite and @xcite .",

    ", the igm density field is expected to be in the mildly non - linear regime , therefore , we look for non - gaussianity in the probability density functions of our reconstructed maps . while its behaviour is nearly gaussian for noiseless data samples , it becomes less gaussian as the noise level is increased , as table [ table : kolmogorov - smirnov ] indicates .    since the smoothing levels used in this study are greater than 10 @xmath7 , it is not possible to see the filamentary structure in the igm topology .",
    "we remind the reader that there are no wide - field galaxy surveys that can detect the topology of the igm at @xmath68 , as it is increasingly expensive to detect galaxies at higher redshifts to reach a high source density , even with 810 m telescopes @xcite .",
