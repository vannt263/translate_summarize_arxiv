    "an important application of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) is their use for emulating a variety of fundamental effects originating in the realm of condensed - matter physics , in a form which is much easier to handle in atomic gases @xcite .",
    "much attention was recently attracted to the implementation of linear couplings between two components of a binary bec , which emulate the spin - orbit ( so ) interactions in solid - state settings , with the respective spinor order parameter mapped into the two - component wave functions of mixtures  of different states of the same atomic species @xcite . besides the fundamental interest concerning the dynamics of spinor becs , the system represents a testbed for the study of artificial gauge fields , which is another topic of a rapidly growing interest  @xcite . to a great extent",
    ", the possibility of emulating condensed - matter effects in ultra - cold gases was brought to the focus of the current research by experiments  @xcite demonstrating the action of abelian and non - abelian synthetic gauge fields in bec  ab - non - ab .",
    "in addition to simulating condensed - matter phenomena , the studies of so - coupled becs reveal new matter - wave effects , produced by the interplay of the so coupling and the mean - field nonlinearity induced by atomic collisions .",
    "such effects include sophisticated vortical @xcite and monopole @xcite structures , multi - domain patterns @xcite , and patterns produced by long - range interactions  @xcite , tricritical points @xcite , skyrmions @xcite , solitons   afkp , latest , interaction with optical lattices @xcite , etc .",
    "note that the system of coupled gross - pitaevskii equations ( gpes ) derived in  ref .",
    "afkp is tantamount to that describing the co - propagation of two polarizations of light in twisted nonlinear optical fibers  @xcite , hence an additional link between completely different physical settings is the possibility to emulate birefringent optical fibers by the so - coupled condensates , and _",
    "vice versa_. furthermore , a recent report on the optical implementation of a model simulating massive dirac fermions dirac_optics indicates the further relevance of results reported below to nonlinear guided - wave optics .",
    "the variety of expected effects in so - coupled bec may be greatly enriched when three ( or more ) atomic levels are employed to define relevant components and interactions between them @xcite .",
    "in particular , _ tripod _ atomic schemes give rise to coupled gpes featuring various nonlinear terms which do not amount to the usual self - phase and cross - phase modulation  @xcite .",
    "such systems open possibilities for nonlinear control of so - coupled becs by means of resonant laser illumination .    while spinor becs typically give rise to two phases with opposite polarizations of pseudo - spins , and to mixtures of such phases  nature , wang , pitaevskii , not every form of the so coupling results in energy splitting between the phases .",
    "for such a situation , the role of the nonlinearity is crucially important , as it lifts the degeneracy and induces the phase separation , cf .",
    "@xcite .    in this work",
    "we study nonlinear modes originating from degenerate linear eigenstates in the so - coupled binary bec loaded into a harmonic - oscillator ( ho ) trap , finding a full set of such nonlinear states .",
    "we produce basic spatial patterns which exist in the case when the rashba  @xcite and dresselhaus  @xcite couplings have equal strengths .",
    "the patterns are built of alternating domains with opposite directions of the pseudo - spin , with each state characterized by zero or nonzero total ( pseudo- ) magnetization .",
    "the number of domains is determined by the strength of the so coupling . the most essential new results concern the stability of the competing states , which is determined by the total magnetization .",
    "in contrast to previously studied settings , we demonstrate that the multi - domain - wall ( dw ) patterns may be _ stable _ while the single dw _ is not _",
    ", hence the system s ground state shifts to the complex patterns .",
    "we also report a possibility of the dynamical switching between different stable patterns .",
    "we consider the two - component effectively one - dimensional ( 1d ) bec described by spinor @xmath0 , whose components @xmath1 and @xmath2 represent pseudo - spin components @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the dynamics of the system is governed by the hamiltonian , @xmath5 , where , in scaled units , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , with pauli matrices @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the axial trapping potential @xcite .",
    "zeeman splitting @xmath10 is induced via a constant magnetic field acting along the @xmath11-axis , while the so coupling , accounted by coefficient @xmath12 , results from a combined effect of the rashba and dresselhaus couplings , and is determined by intensities and wavelengths of laser beams which couple the relevant atomic levels .",
    "the interaction terms for the underlying energy - level scheme are represented by @xmath13 dx$ ]  @xcite .",
    "the derivation of the 1d model from the full 3d one follows the scenario of introducing a tight ho potential of the transverse confinement and factorizing the wave functions into the ground state of that potential and a free longitudinal wave function , which has been elaborated in detail @xcite .",
    "the structure of the so - coupled system does not imply any problem in following this scenario , provided that it leads to the usual cubic nonlinearity .",
    "the situation may be different for relatively dense bec , when the resulting 1d model features deviations from the cubic interactions ( for the binary condensate without the so coupling this situation was elaborated in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which may be a subject for separate analysis  @xcite .",
    "the 1d hamiltonian gives rise to coupled gpes,@xmath14which conserve the total number of atoms , @xmath15 , with @xmath16 .",

    "are shown in fig .",
    "fig : n=0 .",
    "while , as said above , one should expect the immiscibility due to the repulsive interactions , most modes feature the striped antiferromagnetic structure , represented by alternating domains of states @xmath3 and @xmath4 , rather than two large domains separated by a single ( dw , which is the case in the conventional binary bec  @xcite .",
    "it is seen that the number of the domains increases with the so coupling strength , the single dw being present only in panel [ fig : n=0](a ) .",
    "this patterning is precisely explained by the spatially periodic factors in the above analytical solutions . in qualitative terms , the interplay of the ho trap with the so coupling gives rise to scale @xmath79 that determines the periodicity of the striped patterns in fig .",

    "@xcite in the spinor ( three - component ) bec under the action of external magnetic field ( without the so coupling ) .",
    "an essential difference of our system is that the transition between different numbers of domains is controlled by the intrinsic strength of the so coupling , rather than by an additionally introduced magnetic field .",
    "for the so - coupled system with spin @xmath81 , two - dimensional multi - domain patterns were reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , but the stability of those patterns ( which is the main subject of the present analysis ) was not studied .",
    "a similar analysis has been performed for higher - order nonlinear modes , i.e. for ones stemming from excited states of the linear system ( @xmath82 , see above ) .",

    "the resulting formation of robust dynamical modes in the form of breathers is a physically relevant result too .",

    "these stability results are the most essential findings reported in this work , as they demonstrate the previously unreported transition to _ complex ground states _ in the system , under the action of the so coupling .",
    "in fact , this transition may be expected in diverse systems beyond the model of the linearly - coupled binary bec .",
    "the stable patterns are naturally characterized by the total pseudo - magnetization @xmath90 ( @xmath93 means that the condensate is in a single - domain state ) , and by the miscibility factor , @xmath94which takes values @xmath95 , with @xmath96 and @xmath97 corresponding , severally , to the completely immiscible or miscible state .",
    "note that the immiscibility , @xmath98 , may be achieved not only if the phases are spatially separated , but also if one phase disappears , and the condensate falls into a single - domain state , as in the case of the even mode in fig .",

    "figure  [ fig : stab](c ) shows that the nonlinearity enhances the immiscibility of the odd modes , although the effect may be significantly reduced by the coupling , as curve @xmath105 demonstrates . the effect of the interplay between the nonlinearity and so coupling is more sophisticated for even modes , see fig .",
    "[ fig : stab](d ) .",
    "when the so coupling is sufficiently weak ( curve @xmath106 ) or strong ( curve @xmath105 ) , the nonlinear modes preserve properties of their linear counterparts : at @xmath107 the mode is nearly fully polarized ( @xmath108 , @xmath109 ) , while the mode with @xmath110 ( @xmath111 , @xmath112 ) represents a partially miscible state , where both components are equally represented , with @xmath90 close to zero .    the most interesting behavior is observed at intermediate values of the so coupling , which corresponds to @xmath113 in panel ( d ) . in this case , by changing norm @xmath18 one draws the condensate into the immiscible state ( curve @xmath114 ) , and , at the same time , changes @xmath90 between zero and its extreme value @xmath115 .",
    "bearing in mind that the bec nonlinearity may be controlled via the feshbach resonance @xcite , the observed behavior suggests a possibility of switching between the different phases with the help of external fields .",
    "in the linear limit @xmath99 , the zeeman splitting [ @xmath116 in eqs .",

    "now , the system does not admit current states and odd modes , while stable even modes , characterized by even @xmath35 and odd @xmath37 ( or _ vice versa _ ) , persist at @xmath116 .",
    "the evolution of the eigenstates under the action of the increasing zeeman splitting , @xmath10 , is illustrated by the bifurcation diagram in the plane of @xmath117 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmu ] . starting with the point",
