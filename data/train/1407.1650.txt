    "lasserre described a hierarchy of convex semidefinite programming ( sdp ) problems allowing to compute bounds and find global solutions for finite - dimensional nonconvex polynomial optimization problems .",
    "each step in the hierarchy consists of solving a primal moment sdp problem and a dual polynomial sum - of - squares ( sos ) sdp problem corresponding to discretizations of infinite - dimensional linear conic problems , namely a primal linear programming ( lp ) problem on the cone of nonnegative measures , and a dual lp problem on the cone of nonnegative continuous functions .",
    "the number of variables ( number of moments in the primal sdp , degree of the sos certificates in the dual sdp ) increases when progressing in the hierarchy , global optimality can be ensured by checking rank conditions on the moment matrices , and global optimizers can be extracted by numerical linear algebra . for more information on the moment - sos hierarchy and its applications , see @xcite .",
    "this approach was then extended to polynomial optimal control in @xcite . whereas the key idea in @xcite was to reformulate a ( finite - dimensional ) nonconvex polynomial optimization on a compact semi - algebraic set into an lp in the ( infinite - dimensional ) space of probability measures supported on this set , the key idea in @xcite , also developed in @xcite , was to reformulate an ( infinite - dimensional ) nonconvex polynomial optimal control problem with compact constraint set into an lp in the ( infinite - dimensional ) space of occupation measures supported on this set .",
    "note that lp formulations of optimal control problems ( on ordinary differential equations and partial differential equations ) are classical , and can be traced back to the work by l. c. young , filippov , as well as warga and gamkrelidze , amongst many others . for more details and a historical survey , see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* part iii ) .",
    "we believe that what is innovative in @xcite is the observation that the infinite - dimensional linear formulations for optimal control problems can be solved numerically with a moment - sos hierarchy of the same kind as those used in polynomial optimization .    the objective of this contribution is to revisit the approach of @xcite and to survey the use of occupation measures to linearize polynomial optimal control problems .",
    "this is an opportunity to describe duality in infinite - dimensional conic problems , as well as various approximation results on the value function of the optimal control problem .",
    "the primal lp consists of finding occupation measures supported on optimal relaxed controlled trajectories , whereas the dual lp consists of finding the largest lower bound on the value function of the optimal control problem .",
