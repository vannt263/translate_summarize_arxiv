    "high-__t__@xmath13 superconductivity in cuprates results from doping charge carriers into mott insulators .",
    "the magnetic and superconducting properties of mott insulators doped by holes ( @xmath15-type ) are different from those doped by electrons ( @xmath3-type ) , showing asymmetry in the phase diagrams [ 1 ] .",
    "moreover , their transport properties depend on the type of carriers , for example , in - plane normal - state resistivity exhibits quadratic temperature ( _ t _ ) dependence for @xmath3-type cuprates [ 2 ] while linear _",
    "dependence is seen for @xmath15-type cuprates with optimal doping [ 3,4 ] .",
    "such comparisons of electron- and hole - doping asymmetry ( symmetry ) in cuprates should help to further our understanding of the cuprate superconductors [ 5,6 ] .",
    "the typical electron - hole asymmetry ( symmetry ) investigation is usually based on the cuprates with different crystallographic structure such as ncco ( t structure ) and la@xmath10sr@xmath11cuo@xmath12 ( t structure ) .",
    "these materials have different parent mott insulators , and thus , exhibit different properties even without doping [ 7 ] .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to dope electrons and holes into a mott insulator without changing the crystallographic structure and address the physics in both sides of such ` ambipolar ' cuprate .",
    "an ambipolar single - crystal cuprate was first achieved in y@xmath16la@xmath17(ba@xmath18la@xmath11)@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 ( x=0.13 , z=0.62 ) with charge carriers ranging from @xmath19 of holes per cu to @xmath20 of electrons per cu [ 8 ] .",
    "it was also found that y@xmath21la@xmath22(ba@xmath23la@xmath24)@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 exhibits asymmetric behavior in magnetic ground states and transport properties between electron- and hole - doped sides [ 9 ] . however , this asymmetric comparison was limited to insulating state near the zero - doping region due to low carrier density in @xmath3-type samples . in order to fully investigate the @xmath3-@xmath15 asymmetry ( symmetry ) ,",

    ", an electrochemical technique was used to remove oxygen in pure ybco thin films and achieve @xmath3-type metallic state [ 11 ] .",
    "however , carrier density of the @xmath3-type sample was still low ( @xmath27 @xmath5 10@xmath28 @xmath7 ) and the metallic state was only observed above 120 k. chemical doping is necessary for achieving higher electron density . since la@xmath29 possesses a higher valence state than ba@xmath30",
