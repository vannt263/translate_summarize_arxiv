    "recent observations of type ia supernovae by two independent groups , the high - z supernova team ( riess et al .",
    "1998 ) and the supernova cosmology project ( perlmutter et al . 1999 ) suggest that our universe is presently undergoing an accelerating expansion .",
    "the highest redshift supernova observed so far , sn 1997ff at @xmath16 , not only support this accelerating view , but also glimpse the earlier decelerating stage of the expansion ( riess et al .",
    "it seems that determining a convincing mechanism with a solid basis in particle physics that explains the accelerating universe is emerging as one of the most important challenges in modern cosmology .",
    "it is well known that all known types of matter with positive pressure generate attractive forces and decelerate the expansion of the universe  conventionally , a deceleration factor is always used to describe the status of the universe s expansion ( sandage 1988 ) . given this ,",
    "the discovery from the high - redshift type ia supernovae may indicates the existence of a new component with fairly negative pressure , which is now generally called dark energy .",
    "coincidently or not , a dark energy component could offset the deficiency of a flat universe , favoured by the measurements of the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( de bernardis et al .",

    "although a lot of efforts have been made to pin down the amount and nature of the dark energy , it is still far from reaching a convincing machanism with solid basics of particle physics for the accelerating universe .    on the other hand , many models have appeared that make use of the very ideas of branes and extra dimensions to obtain an accelerating universe ( randall and sundrum 1999a , b ; deffayet , dvali and gabadadze 2002 ; avelino and martins 2002 ; alcaniz , jain and dev 2002 ; jain , dev and alcaniz 2002 ) .",
    "the basic idea behind these braneworld cosmologies is that our observable universe might be a surface or a brane embedded in a higher dimensional bulk spacetime in which gravity could spread ( randall 2002 ) .",
    "the bulk gravity see its own curvature term on the brane which accelerates the universe without dark energy .",
    "here we are concerned with the mechanism proposed by freese and lewis ( 2002 ) , in which some kind of bulk stress energy changes the form of the friedmann equation as follows @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the hubble parameter as a function of cosmic time , @xmath23 is the scale factor of the universe , @xmath24 is the energy density containing only ordinary matter ( @xmath25 ) and radiation ( @xmath26 ) , i.e. , @xmath27 . since at present @xmath28",
    ", @xmath24 can be considered consisting of @xmath25 only .",
    "the second term , called cardassion term , would drives the universe accelerating at a late epoch when it is dominated ( or before or after it is dominated , which depends on the power index @xmath0 being equal to or less or larger than @xmath29 , see section 3 for more detail discussion ) , without seeking to another unknown dark energy component .",
    "several authors have explored the agreement of the cardassian expansion model with various observations such as the compact radio source angular size versus redshift data ( zhu and fujimoto 2002 ) , the cosmic macrowave background anisotropy measurements ( sen and sen 2003a , 2003b ) , the distant type ia supernovae data ( zhu and fujimoto 2003 ; wang et al .",

    "we first constrain the parameters from the turnaround redshift , @xmath2 , at which the universe switches from deceleration to acceleration .",
    "secondly we analyze this scenario with the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz)/x - ray data compiled by reese et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , which is so far the largest and homogeneous sample . after providing the basic equations and the angular diameter distance formulas relevant to our analysis ( section  2 )",
    ", we discuss the constraints on the parameter space of the cardassian model from the turaround redshift @xmath2 in section  3 . in section  4",
    ", we present our sz / x - ray data analysis to test the scenario .",
    "finally , we finish the paper by summarizing our conclusions and discussion in section  5 .",
    "we provide here the important equations resulting from the modified friedmann equation , eq.(1 ) , for more details , see freese and lewis ( 2002 ) . in the usual friedmann equation , @xmath30 . to be consistent with the standard comological result , one should take @xmath31 .",
    "it is convenient to use the redshift @xmath32 , at which the two terms of eq.([eq : ansatz ] ) are equal , as the second parameter of the cardassian model . in this parameterization of ( @xmath33 )",
    ", it can be shown that ( freese and lewis 2002 ) , @xmath34^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath35 is the matter density of the universe at the present time and @xmath36kms@xmath37mpc@xmath37 is the hubble constant .",

    "as expected for a flat universe , the `` density parameter '' , @xmath41 , should be equal to @xmath42 .",
    "but we are used to the standard density parameter , @xmath43 , which is defined in terms of the critical density in standard friedmann model . from equation",
    "( 3 ) , we have @xmath44 , and hence we could alternatively use ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) to fully characterize the cardassian model .",
    "now we evaluate the angular diameter distance as a function of redshift @xmath45 as well as the parameters of the model . following the notation of peebles ( 1993 )",
    ", we define the redshift dependence of the hubble paramter @xmath46 as @xmath47 . for the ansatz of eq.([eq : ansatz ] ) and a flat universe with only matter ( baryonic and cold dark matter ) , we get @xmath48\\ ] ] then , it is straightforward to show that the angular diameter distance is given by @xmath49",
    "the cardassian scenario is motivated to provide a possible mechanism for the acceleration of the universe .",
    "it is natually that one could use the observational constraints on the deceleration parameter , @xmath50 , to check the feasibility of the model . in terms of @xmath51 function , we get the deceleration parameter as a function of redshift as follows ( zhu and fujimoto 2003 ) @xmath52 from eq.([eq : newe ] ) , we could derive the turnaround redshift at which the universe switches from deceleration to acceleration , or in other words the redshift at which the deceleration parameter vanishes , which is as follows @xmath53^{1\\over { 3(1-n ) } } \\,\\,.\\ ] ] in figure  1 , we plot this redshift as a function the power index of the cardassian term , @xmath0 , for several values of @xmath1 . while @xmath54 is the current optimistic matter density ( see turner 2002 for the argument ) , @xmath55@xmath56 is a wider range",
    ". the dotted lines of figure  1 correspond to the present observational constraints on the turnaround redshift ( at the @xmath57 level ) , @xmath58 , from the latest supernova data ( perlmutter et al .",
    "1999 ; riess et al . 1998,2001",
    "; turner and riess 2002 ; avelino and martins 2002 ) .",
    "as figure  1 shows , for every value of @xmath1 , there exists a value for the power index of the cardassian term , @xmath59 , satisfying @xmath60 = { 1\\over \\omega_m } -1    \\,\\,,\\ ] ] which makes the turnaround redshift @xmath2 reach the maximum value , @xmath61_{\\rm max } = \\exp\\left[1/ ( 2 - 3n_{\\rm peak } ( \\omega_m))\\right ] -1   \\;\\;.\\ ] ] this @xmath59 ",
    "@xmath4_{\\rm max}$ ] relation is illustrated in figure  1 by the thick dotted - dash line .",
    "for example , for @xmath62 , we have from eq.([eq : npeak ] ) @xmath63 and hence @xmath4_{\\rm max } \\sim 1.05 $ ] , or in other words a universe with @xmath62 can not switch from deceleration to acceleration at redshift higher than @xmath64 , no matter what the power index of the cardassian term is .",
    "we could restate the constraints in an alternative way : for every value of the turnaround redshift @xmath2 , the matter density of the universe must satisfy @xmath65/\\ln(1+z)_{q=0 } } + 1\\right]^{-1 }   \\,\\,,\\ ] ] where the equal mark comes into existence if and only if the power index of the cardassian term is @xmath66/[3\\ln(1+z)_{q=0}]$ ] .",
    "for example , for @xmath5 , as we are considering , we have from eq.([eq : omegammax ] ) @xmath67 , where the equal sign happans at @xmath68 .",
    "the problem is now apparent : a very low matter density would be always necessary for the cardassian expansion scenario if the turneraround redshift is larger than 0.6 , especially for the case of @xmath0 deviating from @xmath69 .    in order to illustrate how the turnaround redshift efficiently constrains the cardassian parameter space ,",
    "we explore the model with different values in the @xmath0@xmath1 plane .",
    "the results are shown in figure  2 .",
    "the thick solid curve delimits the parameter space of accelerating / decelerating universe as the down - left / up - right area of the curve . while the present observational constraints on the turnaround redshift with @xmath58 restrict the parameter space into the narrow shaded area , the observed matter density of the universe limits them further ( see the overlap part of the shaded and the cross - hatched areas ) .",
    "for instance , if the density parameter of the universe takes value around @xmath7 , a reasonable value suggested by various observations , the power index should be around @xmath8 to satisfy @xmath70 .",
    "last but not least , we would like to note that , in the accelerating area , a horizontal line with @xmath71 will delimit it into two parts , @xmath72 or @xmath73 , corresponding to a universe which switches from deceleration to acceleration later or earlier than the moment at which the cardassian term equals to the conventional term of the friedmann equation respectively .",
    "this can be see from the relation of equation ( 7 ) . for clarity",
    ", we do not show it in figure  2 .",
    "therefore the expansion turnaround redshift is generally not equal to @xmath32 , the redshift at which the cardassian term reach the normal matter density term in friedmann equation . only for @xmath74 ,",
    "the acceleration happans exactly when the cardassian term starts to dominate .",
    "however for @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) , the universe switches from deceleration to acceleration after ( before ) the cardassian term dominates .",
    "it is widely believed that the universe only switches from deceleration to acceleration recently , which is based on two observational arguments ( amendola 2003 ) : ( 1)acceleration at high redshift might be in contrast with the observed large - scale structure , because it makes the gravitational instability ineffective ; ( 2)the highest redshift supernova sn1997ff at @xmath77 discovered so far seems to provide a glimpse of the epoch of deceleration ( riess et al . 2001 ; turner and riess 2002 ) .",
    "however a cosmological model with a dark energy component strongly coupled to dark matter ( amendola 2000,2003 ) can be consistent with the above two observations but allow acceleration at high redshift , @xmath78 .",
    "we can see from above analysis that the cardassian expansion model with reasonable matter density , @xmath79 , can hardly explain an acceleration happaned earlier than @xmath80 . in this sense ,",
    "a directly observation of the acceleration might be one of the most crucial and efficient tests to discriminate different machanisms for acceleration .",
    "there have been so far two proposals for this kind of measurements .",
    "one is to monitor the redshift change of quasars during ten years or so ( loeb 1998 ) .",
    "another one is to measure the gravitational wave phase of neutron star binaries at @xmath81 for ten years using a decihertz interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( decigo : seto , kawamura and nakamura 2001 ) .",
    "they might provide an efficient test for various acceleration mechanisms .",
    "it has long been suggested that a measurement of the thermal sz effect ( sunyaev and zeldovich 1972 ) of a cluster of galaxies , combined with x - ray observations , can be used to determine the cluster cosmological angular - diameter distance and hence the hubble constant @xmath10 and the deceleration parameter @xmath82 ( cavaliere , danese and de zotti 1977 ; silk and white 1978 ; birkinshaw 1979 ) .",
    "benefiting from the improvements to the traditional single - dish observations ( myers et al .",
    "1997 ) and thanks to the new bolometer technology ( holzapfel et al . 1997 ) and interferometry technique ( calstrom , joy and grego 1996 ) , several tens of clusters of galaxies have been selected for the sz measurements and have been used to determine the hubble constant ( for recent summaries , see birkinshaw 1999 ; calstrom , holder and reese 2002 ) . recently ,",
    "reese et al . ( 2002 ) published the sz measurements of a sample of 18 galaxy clusters with redshifts ranging from 0.14 to 0.83 observed by the owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) and the berkeley - illinois - maryland association ( bima ) interferometers .",
    "the author used the maximum likelihood joint analysis method to analyze their sz measurements with archival rosat x - ray imaging observations , which provide the largest homogeneously analyzed sample of the sz / x - ray clusters with angular diameter distance determinations so far ( reese et al .",
    "the database is shown in figure  3 . because the redshift range of the cluster sample is comparable to the distant type ia supernovae data compiled by riess et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and perlmutter et al .",
    "( 1999 ) that lead to the discovery of accelerating expansion , it provides well an independent cross check of the acceleration mechanism .",
    "we use this sample to give an observational constraint on the cardassian model parameters , @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( or @xmath83 ) .",
    "we determine the model parameters @xmath0 and @xmath83 through a @xmath84 minimization method .",
    "the range of @xmath0 spans the interval [ -1 , 1 ] in steps of 0.01 , while the range of @xmath83 spans the interval [ 0,1-@xmath15 ] in 101 points .",
    "@xmath86^{2}}{\\sigma_{i}^{2}}},\\ ] ] where @xmath87 are the redshifts of the galaxy clusters and @xmath88 are the theoretical predictions from equation  ( [ eq : da ] ) .",
    "@xmath89 are the angular diameter distances of the cluster sample determined by the sz / x - ray route .",
    "@xmath90 are the symmetric root - mean - square errors of the cluster distance measurements ( reese et al .",
    "2002 ; allen , schmidt and fabian 2002 ) .",
    "the summation is over all the observational data points .    in order to reduce the number of parameters to be determined ,",
    "we specify the baryonic matter density parameter to be @xmath91 ( omeara et al . 2001 ; allen , schmidt and fabian 2002 ) . in order to make the analysis independent of choice of the hubble constant , we minimize eq.([eq : chi2 ] ) for @xmath10 , @xmath0 and @xmath83 , simultaneously , which gives @xmath9259.6@xmath93km@xmath93s@xmath94mpc@xmath37 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 as the best fit with @xmath97 and 15 degrees of freedom ( d.o.f ) . an inspection of terms of @xmath97 for the above best fit shows that in this summation a big amount , namely @xmath98 , is given by one cluster abell 370 with redshift 0.374 , which should be considered as an outlier .",
    "following reese et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , we also analyze the subsample of 17 galaxy clusters which excludes the outlier , abell 370 . from the view of statistics ,",
    "an outlier appears when it is inconsistent with the remainder of the data set , and is better to be removed from the sample ( mszros 2002 ) .",
    "a glimpse of figure  3 , one immediately find that abell 370 might be an outlier , because it is far above the distances expected from the trend given by other objects , in another word , it is `` too far '' .",
    "our best fit to the rest 17 clusters occurs for @xmath9259.2@xmath93km@xmath93s@xmath94mpc@xmath37 , @xmath99 and @xmath96 with @xmath100 and 14 d.o.f . in figure  4",
    ", we show contours of constant likelihood ( 68% and 95% c.l . ) in the @xmath0@xmath1 plane for the best fit .",
    "the fitting results for samples with and without abell 370 are very similar , but the @xmath11 per d.o.f for the latter reduces significantly and indicates that no large statistical errors remain unaccounted for .",
    "the similarity of the fitting results also indicates the robustness of our analysis .",
    "the best fits of the cardassian expansion model to the current sz / x - ray data lead to a universe containing baryonic matter only , leaving no space for the huge amount of dark matter whose existence has been widely accepted among the astronomical community .",
    "however , note from figure  4 that the allowed range for both @xmath0 and @xmath83 is reasonable large , showing that the constraints on cardassian expansion from the considered sz / x - ray cluster sample are not restrictive .",
    "for example , the models with reasonable matter density ( @xmath7 ) but some negative values of @xmath0 are within @xmath57 of the best fit .",
    "we have explored the constraints on the parameter space of the cardassian scenario from the turnaround redshift , @xmath2 , at which the universe switches from deceleration to acceleration .",
    "we demonstrated that , for every matter density , @xmath1 , there exist a unique power index , @xmath3 , which makes @xmath2 reach its maximum value . if the acceleration happans earlier than @xmath5 , it is found @xmath8 for a reasonable matter density , @xmath7 .",
    "it is also found that the cardassian scenario can hardly explain an acceleration happaned earlier than @xmath101 .",
    "we further analyzed the scenario using the largest homogeneously sample of sz / x - ray clusters compiled by reese et al .",
    "all best fitting results seem to give a universe with very low matter density ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "our analysis is consistent with previous observational constraints ( sen and sen 2003a,2003b ; wang et al .",
    "2003 ; cao 2003 ; zhu and fujimoto 2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "however at present both the statistical and systematic uncertainties in the sz / x - ray route of distance determination are very large ( birkinshaw 1999 ; reese et al .",
    "2002 ; calstrom , holder and reese 2002 ) . which loosen the constraints of the cardassian expansion scenario very much ( figure  4 )",
    "therefore , the cardassian expansion scenario with reasonable matter density is also consistent with the current sz / x - ray data within @xmath57 .",
    "the projection effect of aspherical clusters modeled with a spherical geometry is a large systematic error in the angular diameter distance determinations based on the sz / x - ray route ( hughes and birkinshaw 1998 ) .",
    "other large systematic uncertainties are due to the departures form the isothermality , the possibility of clumping and possible point source contamination of the sz observations ( calstrom , holder and reese 2002 ; reese et al .",
    "it is promising to improve the systematic uncertainties for both sz and x - ray observations within a few years .",
    "the absolute calibration of the sz observation is now underway to improve significantly ( calstrom , holder and reese 2002 ) .",
    "the chandra and xmm - newton x - ray telescopes not only reduce the uncertainty in the x - ray intensity scale , but also are providing temperature profiles of galaxy clusters ( markevitch et al .",
    "2000 ; nevalainen , markevitch and forman 2000 ) .",
    "the undergoing or planing large survey of sz clusters will perhaps provide a sz / x - ray sample of a few hundred clusters with redshift extending to one and beyond , which will improve our analysis and pin down the cardassian model parameters more accurately .",

    "<S> cosmic acceleration is one of the most remarkable cosmological findings of recent years . </S>",
    "<S> although a dark energy component has usually been invoked as the mechanism for the acceleration , a modification of friedmann equation from various higher dimensional models provides a feasible alternative . </S>",
    "<S> cardassian expansion is one of these scenarios , in which the universe is flat , matter ( and radiation ) dominated and accelerating but contains no dark energy component . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario is fully characterized by @xmath0 , the power index of the so - called cardassian term in the modified friedmann equation , and @xmath1 , the matter density parameter of the universe . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we first consider the constraints on the parameter space from the turnaround redshift , @xmath2 , at which the universe switches from deceleration to acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , for every @xmath1 , there exist a unique @xmath3 , which makes @xmath2 reach its maximum value , @xmath4_{\\rm max } = \\exp\\left[1/ ( 2 - 3n_{\\rm peak})\\right ] -1 $ ] , which is unlinearly inverse to @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> if the acceleration happans earlier than @xmath5 , suggested by type ia supernovae measurements , we have @xmath6 no matter what the power index is , and moreover , for reasonable matter density , @xmath7 , it is found @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we next test this scenario using the sunyaev - zeldovich / x - ray data of a sample of 18 galaxy clusters with @xmath9 compiled by reese et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2002 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we determine @xmath0 and @xmath1 , as well as the hubble constant @xmath10 , using the @xmath11 minimization method . </S>",
    "<S> the best fit to the data gives @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 is the baryonic matter density parameter ) . </S>",
    "<S> however the constraints from the current sz / x - ray data is weak , though a model with lower matter density is prefered . </S>",
    "<S> a certain range of the model parameters is also consistent with the data . </S>"
