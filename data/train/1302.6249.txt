    "recent observational evidences show that the expansion of our universe is currently accelerating @xcite . this discovery has opened several possibilities to explain the nature of the late - time acceleration . by constructing reasonable models that account for this phenomenon , the nature of the cosmic acceleration could be either attributed to an exotic dark energy component that makes up roughly 70 percent of the universe @xcite , or described by a modified gravity theory such that the predictions are consistent with the current observational data @xcite . if the late - time accelerated expansion is driven by dark energy , the simplest setup is by adding a cosmological constant @xmath0 to einstein equation with cold dark matter on top of the baryonic sector ( @xmath0cdm model ) , which fits very well the observations even though the cosmological constant has to be extremely fine - tuned as compared with the expected value from quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "however , there are several other candidates that can play the role of dark energy , which can be characterized by an equation of state @xmath1 .",
    "the equation of state @xmath1 of a given matter content is defined by the ratio between its pressure and its energy density , i.e. , the equation of state @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the pressure and the energy density of the matter , respectively . from current observations ,",
    "the equation of state of dark energy is very close to @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , unlike the cosmological constant whose equation of state is strictly equal to @xmath5 , the equation of state of dark energy could deviate from @xmath5 a bit and vary with time .",
    "furthermore , dark energy with equation of state @xmath6 has not been excluded observationally @xcite . which is also known as phantom energy @xcite .",
    "if this hypothetical phantom energy exists in the late - time universe , our universe will enter into a super - accelerating epoch and space - time singularities might occur in the future . within a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw )",
    "metric , dark energy related future space - time singularities can be classified as follows depending on different types of divergence @xcite :    * big rip singularity : the singularity happens at a finite cosmic time @xmath7 where the scale factor @xmath8 , the hubble parameter @xmath9 and its cosmic time derivative @xmath10 diverge @xcite , i.e. , when @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 ; * sudden singularity : the singularity happens at a finite cosmic time with a finite scale factor , where the hubble parameter remains finite but its cosmic time derivative diverges @xcite , i.e. , when @xmath11 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath14 ; * big freeze singularity : the singularity happens at a finite cosmic time with a finite scale factor where the hubble parameter and its cosmic time derivative diverge @xcite , i.e. , when @xmath11 , @xmath15 , @xmath17 and @xmath14 ; * type slowromancap4@ singularity : the singularity happens at a finite cosmic time with finite scale factor where the hubble parameter and its cosmic time derivative remain finite , but higher cosmic time derivatives of the hubble parameter still diverge @xcite ;    where @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are finite constants . however , in addition to the possible space - time singularities mentioned above and connected with dark energy , there exist other possible abrupt events that are smoother than those enumerated above and are also connected with dark energy :    * little rip event : there is no future space - time singularity ; however , the scale factor , the hubble parameter and its cosmic time derivative all diverge at an infinite cosmic time @xcite , i.e. , when @xmath21 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 ; * @xmath1-singularity : the equation of state @xmath1 diverges at a finite cosmic time with a finite scale factor , where the energy density @xmath4 and the pressure @xmath3 vanish @xcite , i.e. , when @xmath11 , @xmath15 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 ; * pseudo - rip event : the hubble parameter approaches a constant as the cosmic time goes to infinity with an infinite scale factor , where the disintegration of bound structures may or may not occur in this case @xcite , i.e. , when @xmath21 , @xmath12 and @xmath16 .    among these events ,",
    "the little rip is quite similar to a big rip singularity except that the former happens at infinite future while the latter at a finite cosmic time .",
    "such event , despite avoiding a future singularity at a finite cosmic time , will still lead to the destruction of all structures in the universe .",

    "some possible space - time singularities as well as smoother abrupt events within a flrw universe filled with phantom dark energy are enumerated in sec .",
    "[ introduction ] .",
    "one of these abrupt events is the little rip that is quite similar to a big rip singularity as the scale factor , the hubble parameter , and its cosmic time derivative all approach infinity as in the big rip albeit at infinite future .",
    "even though for a little rip there is no space - time singularity occurrence at a finite cosmic time , all bound structures in the universe will be destroyed on its way to the little rip @xcite . within a relativistic model ,",
    "i.e. , a 4d gr setup , a perfect fluid whose equation of state reads : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a positive constant , can induce a future little rip event @xcite .",
    "this kind of event was first found in @xcite and also on a dilatonic brane - world model @xcite . for the latter case ,",
    "the author described the event as a big rip singularity postponed to an infinite future cosmic time .",
    "recently , this kind of event has been named `` little rip '' @xcite .    instead of a relativistic gr model ,",
    "here we consider the self - accelerating branch @xmath56 of the modified friedmann equation ( [ cubic ] ) , because it involves uv and ir effects which could be applied to smooth the little rip or at least to appease it .",
    "we remind at this regard that the little rip happens at very high energies where we expect some uv corrections to gr , and at the same time in the far future where ir modifications to gr are also to be expected .",
    "this is the reason why we consider a dark energy component ; more precisely , a perfect fluid described by eq.([littlerip ] ) , filling the self - accelerating brane on top of dark matter .",
    "we will show that a future sudden singularity appears when the dimensionless energy density @xmath52 approaches the finite constant @xmath65 .",
    "consequently , a sudden singularity will replace the little rip .",
    "given that we are interested in the late - time evolution of the brane and the possible avoidance of the little rip , we assume that the brane total energy density is made up of non - relativistic matter as well as phantom energy with equation of state ( [ littlerip ] ) : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the energy density of the non - relativistic matter , @xmath68 is the conserved energy density of the phantom dark energy ( [ littlerip ] ) , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the current energy density for matter and phantom dark energy , respectively , and the current scale factor @xmath71 is fixed as @xmath72 .    in order to analyze the asymptotic future behavior of the self - accelerating branch @xmath56 , we need to analyze the future behavior of the hubble rate given by eq .",
    "( [ selfaccelerating ] ) and its cosmic time derivative .",
    "the cosmic time derivative of the hubble parameter can be obtained either from the time derivative of the branch @xmath56 ( [ selfaccelerating ] ) or from the time derivative of the cubic friedmann equation ( [ cubic ] ) .",
    "either ways lead us to the result : @xmath73 where we have already used the energy conservation condition for the total matter content confined on the brane : @xmath74 therefore , taking into account the total energy density given by eq.([total ] ) , the cosmic time derivative of the hubble parameter in the self - accelerating branch is given by @xmath75 notice that the denominator of eq.([hdot ] ) is always negative in the self - accelerating branch solution , which can be checked using the explicit self - accelerating solution @xmath56 ( [ selfaccelerating ] ) where the range of the parameter @xmath47 is given in eq.([range ] ) .",
    "therefore , the cosmic time derivative of the hubble parameter will become positive once the phantom dark energy dominates over the non - relativistic matter , more precisely when @xmath76 .",
    "when the dimensionless energy density @xmath52 tends to @xmath65 , the self - accelerating solution @xmath56 approaches the constant value ( see table [ solutions ] and fig .  [ branches ] ) : @xmath77,\\label{limiting}\\ ] ] consequently , the hubble parameter reaches the constant value : @xmath78 from eqs.([hdot])-([limitingh ] ) we find that the cosmic time derivative of the hubble parameter blows up when @xmath79 , while the hubble parameter , the energy density and pressure on the brane remain finite at this point . besides , the cosmic time ellapsed since the present time @xmath80 , till the singularity ocurrence at @xmath18 is given by the integral @xmath81 , which is finite since @xmath82 is a non - vanishing analytical function of the scale factor @xmath8 between the two limits @xmath19 and @xmath72 , i.e. , a sudden singularity takes place at @xmath19 .",
    "consequently , a phantom dark energy perfect fluid ( [ littlerip ] ) that induces a little rip event in gr is replaced by a sudden singularity , or a  big brake \" , through the self - accelerating branch of the brane - world with gb and ig effects .",
    "notice that this event is different from the one found in refs .",
    "in this section , we consider a spatially flat dgp brane embedded in a minkowski bulk with a gb modification ( dgp - gb ) , i.e. , described by the modified friedmann equation ( [ friedmann ] ) with a vanishing bulk cosmological constant and brane tension , and @xmath61 .",
    "the hubble rate of the branch containing the dgp self - accelerating branch in this case can be rewritten as @xmath83 the current expansion of the universe is dominated by non - relativistic matter and dark energy which we model through eq.([total ] ) , the later we refer to it as `` little rip '' phantom matter as in gr it would lead to this kind of event .",

    "furthermore , combining the conservation equation of the effective dark energy : @xmath94 with the effective energy density definition ( [ deeff ] ) , we obtain the effective equation of state @xmath95 : @xmath96 where @xmath97 .",
    "this effective equation of state describes the evolution property of the effective dark energy @xmath98 , in particular at late - time .",
    "in addition , the deceleration parameter @xmath99 is also an important cosmological parameter that could be used to characterize the late - time behavior of the universe and to constrain the model .",
    "the deceleration parameter is defined by @xmath100 , which can be rewritten as @xmath101 where the self - accelerating branch @xmath102 is given by eqs.([barx2 ] ) and ( [ selfaccelerating ] ) .    before calculating the effective equation of state @xmath95 and the deceleration parameter @xmath99 numerically , we highlight that both @xmath95 and @xmath99 approach negative infinite values when the universe is close to the sudden singularity @xmath103 , since the cosmic time derivative of the hubble parameter blows up at the singularity ; while the hubble parameter and the total energy density remain finite .",
    "we assume that this self - accelerating dgp - gb model ( [ e(a ) ] ) behaves much like the standard @xmath0cdm model at present and on the near future .",
    "thus we expect the density parameters @xmath104 and @xmath105 due to the brane - world effect to be tiny compared to the other density parameters .",
    "therefore , we could pick out the results derived from the @xmath0cdm model to obtain some preliminary constrains of our model ; we assume also that the density parameter for matter nowadays @xmath106 to be independent of the cosmological model , i.e. , we fix the parameter @xmath107 for the non - relativistic matter on the brane .",
    "furthermore , we constrain the model by using the deceleration parameter @xmath108 of the @xmath0cdm model at the present time : @xmath109 , which is valid for gr .",
    "we can calculate the deceleration parameter using eqs.([deceleration ] ) and ( [ e(a ) ] ) , which at present reads @xmath110 the previous relation gives a constraint among the model parameters , which reduces the number of free parameters to two ( e.g. @xmath104 and @xmath64 ) .",
    "in addition , since we expect the model to mimic @xmath0cdm cosmology reasonably well at the present time , the best - fit range for the parameter @xmath64 is considered as obtained in the ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath111 .",
    "despite that negative values of @xmath64 are allowed observationally , we stick to positive values of @xmath64 , such that the little rip event takes place in gr for a flrw universe filled with the `` little rip '' phantom matter given in eq.([littlerip ] ) .    after imposing the constraints on these parameters , we then evaluate the effective equation of state @xmath95 ( [ weffctive ] ) as a function of the scale factor numerically .",
    "notice that the parameter space is picked out such that the density parameter @xmath104 and @xmath105 due to the brane - world effect are very small , and therefore the model behaves almost like the @xmath0cdm model at the present time .",
    "[ weff ] shows that the behavior of the effective equation of state @xmath95 with respect to the scale factor .",
    "we can see that the effects from the dgp - gb brane - world with phantom energy ( [ littlerip ] ) will induce a mimicry of a crossing of the phantom divide at the late - time universe ( see fig .",
    "[ weff ] ) .",
    "furthermore , it is more sensitive to the parameter @xmath64 than to the parameter @xmath104 .",
    "in addition , we also calculate and plot the deceleration parameter @xmath99 [ see eq.([deceleration ] ) ] numerically as shown in fig .  [ q ] .",
    "this figure shows that our universe has entered in an accelerating expansion phase ( @xmath112 ) recently , roughly since the scale factor reached the value @xmath113 .",
    "besides , the four curves shown in fig .  [ qa ] , corresponding to different values of @xmath64 , shows that the deceleration parameter is only sensitive to different values of @xmath64 in the near past when @xmath114 .      as we have seen in the previous section the little rip event in gr",
    "can be replaced by a sudden singularity through the self - accelerating branch of the dgp - gb brane - world .",
    "we can interpret this result as a smoothing of the little rip in the sense that the hubble parameter @xmath9 is finite , even though the sudden singularity happens before the little rip at a finite cosmic time .",
    "we further estimate when the sudden singularity will happen in the future within this dgp - gb brane - world , with a cosmological expansion dictated by eq .",
    "( [ e(a ) ] ) and a matter content including a phantom dark energy given in eq .",
    "( [ littlerip ] ) .",
    "the sudden singularity takes place when the dimensionless energy density @xmath79 [ see fig .",
    "[ branches ] and eq.([hdot ] ) ] . therefore , in order to obtain when the sudden singularity is reached , we can directly equate the dimensionless energy parameter @xmath52 ( [ rhobar2 ] ) to the value of the singularity point @xmath65 ( [ rho1 ] ) , and the resulting equation gives the scale factor @xmath115 where the sudden singularity happens .",
    "such a scale factor , @xmath116 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ sudsingx ] for various parameter @xmath64 with different density parameters @xmath104 .",
    "we see as well in fig .",
    "[ sudsingx ] that the larger the parameter @xmath64 the sooner the sudden singularity happens .",
    "this outcome is reasonable since a larger parameter @xmath64 generates a smaller effective equation of state @xmath95 , i.e. , a more negative one , as shown in fig .",
    "[ weffa ] , which will cause a sooner doomsday .",
    "likewise , we can calculate as well the cosmic time remaining from now till the doomsday .",
    "this time scale can be obtained by computing the following integration numerically : @xmath117 where @xmath118 and the self - accelerating branch @xmath102 is given by the eqs.([barx2 ] ) and ( [ selfaccelerating ] ) .",
    "the numerical results are shown in fig .",
    "[ sudsingt ] , where we can compare our results with the age of the universe since the age of our universe at present is roughly of the order of the hubble time @xmath119 .",
    "thus as we can see in fig .",
    "[ sudsingt ] , the sudden singularity would take place roughly in the far future at a cosmic time of the order of a hundred times the hubble time , i.e. , roughly 1300gyr .",
    "the little rip event in a relativistic flrw universe described by gr can avoid the future space - time singularity at a finite cosmic time ; however , it will ultimately lead to the dissolution of all bound structures in the universe .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to investigate if this abrupt event could be smoothed or replaced in some way . since this kind of doomsday , which is induced by phantom dark energy , as the one given by eq .",
    "( [ littlerip ] ) , will take place at high energy , where uv effect could be required , and in the future , where ir effect could be as well required , we suppose that the combination of uv as well as the ir modifications to gr could give a resolution to this abrupt event . in this respect , we consider here our universe to be described by the self - accelerating branch ( [ selfaccelerating ] ) of a generalized brane - world system that is modified by gb modification in the bulk and ig effects on the brane , where the gb / ig effects become significant at the high / late - time regime , respectively . this framework may provide us some insights on the avoidance of abrupt events in the future evolution of the universe .    with the same kind of phantom fluid ( [ littlerip ] ) confined on the brane , we discover that a sudden singularity will take place in the future instead of a little rip event .",
    "thus this finding shows that the little rip event is smoothed through a brane - world system with gb and ig effects as we expected , in the sense that the hubble parameter remains finite during the whole evolution of the brane ; nevertheless , the trade - off is that the sudden singularity will happen sooner than the little rip ( but still in the far future ) , where the cosmic time derivative of the hubble rate will diverge .",
    "based on this analysis , we then study the late - time behavior of the brane and estimate when the sudden singularity will take place in the future within a self - accelerating branch of a dgp - gb model , under the assumption that the self - accelerating dgp - gb brane is filled with dark matter and phantom energy as the one given in eq.([littlerip ] ) .",
    "we assume as well that the model do not deviate too much from the @xmath0cdm model nowadays . consequently",
    ", we conclude that the sudden singularity will occur in a future time roughly of the order of a hundred times the age of the universe , i.e. , @xmath1201300gyr .",
    "moreover , a smaller parameter @xmath64 in eq.([littlerip ] ) will result in a larger effective equation of state @xmath95 for the effective dark energy @xmath98 ( [ deeff ] ) , which will push the sudden singularity to a farther future ( see figs .",
