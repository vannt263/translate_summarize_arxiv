    "the neutrino transport plays an important role in some astrophysical phenomena such as supernova explosions and the following proto neutron star cooling ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . in their studies , the boltzmann equation or its approximate versions",
    "are commonly employed to describe the temporal variations of neutrino distributions in the phase space .",
    "these equations are usually derived from the following assumptions@xcite : ( 1 ) the neutrinos are propagating along the geodesics for a massless particle , @xmath0 , and the volume in the phase space occupied by these neutrinos is not varied along their world line if there is no reaction . ( 2 ) the variation of the neutrino population due to reactions is described by the so - called collision terms obtained with the stohszahl ansatz . with the masses non - diagonal in the neutrino flavor space , the neutrino oscillation occurs among different flavors of neutrinos(e.g . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is thus interesting from an academic point of view how this oscillation phenomenon is described by the generalized boltzmann equations@xcite .",
    "it is also important from a practical point of view for those who are interested in the possible significant consequences the oscillation might give in astrophysical events@xcite . in collapse - driven supernova explosions , for example ,",
    "this is particularly the case if the resonance of oscillation occurs near a neutrino sphere where neutrinos are interacting with other particles and thus the oscillation should be treated simultaneously with these reactions and possibly with the evolution of the matter distribution as well .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide the formulation which can be easily implemented in those numerical simulations .    in considering the transport equation with the oscillation",
    ", we have to rely on a more formal derivation of the boltzmann equation .",
    "this might be done in a couple of ways .",
    "sirera and prez@xcite , for instance , based their derivation on the relativistic wigner function approach in the mean field approximation . although they took the relativistic kinematics properly into account , they did not obtain the collision terms , since it is difficult to go beyond the mean field approximation in their formalism .",
    "raffelt et al.@xcite , on the other hand , obtained their transport equation via the density matrix approach .",
    "although they derived the collision terms , they did not consider the spatially inhomogeneous system . in this paper , we derive the relativistic boltzmann equation including corrections due to the oscillation both in the advection terms and the collision terms by employing the real time formalism of the nonequilibrium field theory@xcite . in this approach , the dispersion relation and the collision terms",
    "are derived on the same basis , that is , a particular approximation for the self - energy of neutrinos , which is conveniently represented with feynman diagrams .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first derive a generic form of the transport equation without specifying particular equations of motion of fields .",
    "then , the formulation is applied to the neutrino flavor oscillations . in so doing ,",
    "we ignore small corrections of the order of @xmath1 except for the terms responsible for the flavor conversion , as is usually the case . here",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 are typical mass and energy of neutrinos in the observer s inertial frame . in this limit , as shown later , the left handed neutrinos are decoupled from the right handed ones and the difference between majorana mass and dirac mass never shows up in the flavor mixing .",
    "the general relativistic corrections are obtained up to the leading order of @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a typical wave length of neutrino and @xmath6 is a scale height of the background matter distribution .",
    "in this section we derive general transport equations for multi - component fields based on the real time formalism of nonequilibrium field theory by keldysh@xcite . in this formalism",

    "the collision terms derived here , on the other hand , have the same structure as those found by raffelt et al.@xcite in the non - relativistic density matrix method .",
    "we have also shown the general relativistic correction term which accounts for the red shift and ray bending in the gravitational field and is commonly taken into account in the supernova and proto neutron star simulations .    the applications of the boltzmann equation found here remain to be done",
    ". since the corrections due to the flavor mixing are rather minor , particularly in the case of the adiabatic mixing , it will be simple to implement them in the neutrino transport code we have now at our disposal@xcite .",
    "this is already underway . since the mixing angle in matter is dependent on the neutrino energy and the direction of momentum with respect to the magnetic field",
    "if it exists . in the analyses of the neutrino flavor mixing in the supernova core , it is usually assumed that the neutrinos are flowing out radially@xcite .",
    "however , they have an angular distribution near the neutrino sphere . different positions of the resonant conversion due to different directions of flight of neutrinos will lead to the reduction of the neutrino flavor conversion .",
    "this will also be true in the absence of the magnetic field if the energy distribution of neutrinos and the coupling between neutrinos with different energies are taken into account .",
    "these possibilities and their implications to the mechanism of the supernova explosion , kick velocity of pulsars , and nucleosynthesis of heavy elements will be studied in the forthcoming papers .",

    "<S> with a view of applications to the simulations of supernova explosion and proto neutron star cooling , we derive the boltzmann equations for the neutrino transport with the flavor mixing based on the real time formalism of the nonequilibrium field theory and the gradient expansion of the green function . </S>",
    "<S> the relativistic kinematics is properly taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> the advection terms are derived in the mean field approximation for the neutrino self - energy whiles the collision terms are obtained in the born approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting equations take the familiar form of the boltzmann equation with corrections due to the mixing both in the advection part and in the collision part . </S>",
    "<S> these corrections are essentially the same as those derived by sirera et al . for the advection terms and those by raffelt et al . for the collision terms , respectively , though the formalism employed here is different from theirs . </S>",
    "<S> the derived equations will be easily implemented in numerical codes employed in the simulations of supernova explosions and proto neutron star cooling . </S>"
