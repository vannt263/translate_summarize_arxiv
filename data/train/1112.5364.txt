    "it was proposed by efimov in 1970 that if two spinless neutral bosons interact resonantly then the addition of a third identical particle leads to the appearance of an infinite number of bound three - body energy levels  @xcite .",
    "this occurs simultaneously with the divergence of the @xmath1-wave scattering length @xmath2 , associated with appearance of an additional zero - energy two - body bound state .",
    "hence highly exotic efimov states appear when there is a zero or near - zero energy two - body bound state . for a long time",
    "there was no clear signature of efimov states in any naturally occuring trimer system .",
    "efimov states are not possible in atomic systems due to the long range coulomb interaction , however it may exist in the system of spinless neutral atoms .",
    "even though the efimov effect was predicted four decades ago  @xcite , evidence of its existence in ultracold caesium and potassium trimers has been experimentally established only very recently  @xcite .",
    "however , these trimers are obtained by manipulating two - body forces through feshbach resonances and are not naturally occuring .",
    "therefore , it is of great interest to search for the efimov effect in a naturally occuring trimer , like @xmath3he trimer .",
    "so far no experimental confirmation has been reported .",
    "the near - zero energy ( @xmath4 1 mk ) bound state ( which is also the only bound state ) of @xmath0he dimer opens the possibility of the existence of an efimov - like state in @xmath0he trimer .",
    "several authors remarked that the @xmath0he trimer may be the most promising candidate .",
    "earlier theoretical calculations show that the trimer has a @xmath5 = 0 ground state at 126 mk and a near - zero energy excited state ( @xmath6 2mk )  @xcite .",
    "the excited state has been claimed to be an efimov state .",
    "a controversy arises from the fact that the number of efimov states is highly sensitive to the binding energy of the dimer and even a very small decrease of the strength of two - body interaction makes the system unbound .",

    "first , the he - dimer potential is not uniquely known .",
    "very small uncertainities in the dimer potential may lead to different conclusions .",
    "secondly , the strong short - range interatomic repulsion in the he - he interaction causes large numerical errors .",
    "as @xmath0he systems are strongly correlated due to large @xmath0he@xmath0he repulsion at short separation , the effect of interatomic correlation must be taken properly into account .",
    "+ in the present communication , we revisit the problem using a correlated basis function known as potential harmonics ( ph ) basis which takes care of two - body correlations  @xcite . in order to include the effect of highly repulsive he - he core",
    ", we multiply the ph basis with a suitable short - range correlation function which reproduces the correct short - range behavior of the dimer wavefunction .",
    "although this correlated ph basis ( cph basis ) correctly reproduces the dimer and trimer properties , we could not find any efimov like state in trimer with the actual dimer interaction  @xcite .",
    "we point out that the calculation of such a near - zero energy excited state in the shallow and extended trimer potential may involve severe numerical errors and we may miss it .",

    "any given potential , families of strictly isospectral potentials , _ with very different shape _ but having desirable and adjustable features are generated by supersymmetric isospectral formalism  @xcite .",
    "the near - zero energy bound state will be more effectively bound in the deep narrow well of the isospectral potential and will facilitate an easier and more accurate calculation of the near - zero energy excited state . following the steps of supersymmetric quantum mechanics  @xcite , for any given potential @xmath7 , one can construct a class of potentials @xmath8 , where @xmath9 represents a set of one or more continuously variable real parameters .",

    "hence , the near - zero energy ( indicated in fig .  1 by a horizontal line ) excited state in @xmath7 will be at the _ same energy value _ in the isospectral potentials , but now that state will lie _ deep within the naw_. thus , while this state is weakly bound and spatially extended in the original potential , it will be strongly bound and well localized in the naw of the isospectral potential , at the same energy . clearly , computation of the wave function and its energy ( equal to the energy of the first excited state in the original potential ) will be easier .",
    "furthermore , this state becomes more strongly bound , as @xmath13 decreases . in general , as @xmath13 decreases continuously from @xmath22 to @xmath23 , @xmath10 starts developing a local minimum which shifts towards @xmath20=0 and becomes deeper and narrower .",
    "consequently , a shallow potential transforms into one having a narrow and deep potential well near the origin in the isospectral potential .",

    "<S> the near - zero energy efimov state in the original potential is effectively trapped in the deep well of the isospectral family and facilitates more accurate calculation of the efimov state . application to the first excited state in @xmath0he trimer is presented . </S>"
