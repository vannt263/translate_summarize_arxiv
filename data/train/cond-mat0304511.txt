    "the interplay between electrical and mechanical degrees of freedom is crucial for the transport of charge through the system .",
    "this is due to the coulomb forces exerted by the charge carriers which may be strong enough to cause mechanical deformations of the systems .",
    "one system where such interplay drastically changes the charge transport properties is the single electron shuttle system  @xcite .",
    "there a metallic grain is embedded in an elastic material between two bulk leads .",
    "since current through that system is accompanied by charging of the grain , interplay between the coulomb forces and the mechanical degrees of freedom can lead to self oscillations of the grain and electrons can be seen as shuttled across the gap between the leads .",

    "we report on a numerical investigation of the effects of vdw - forces on the shuttle transport mechanism .",
    "the main result is that a new voltage scale comes into play , above which a grain trapped by the van der waals force will be set loose due to the coulomb interactions between the grain and the substrate .",

    "increasing the bias leads to larger oscillation amplitudes at constant frequency , meaning that the grain comes closer to the lead . since the tunnel resistance decreases exponentially with decreasing grain - lead distance the tunnel rate increases exponentially .",
