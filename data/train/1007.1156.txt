    "recently , the noise - assisted transport of brownian particles has attracted considerable attention , which is still growing in view of possible applications in various branches of physics and chemistry.@xcite unfortunately , experimental investigation of transport phenomena on a molecular scale is extremely difficult , thus apart from theoretical studies there is a need for adequate physical systems , modeling various transport phenomena in a way which could be accessible experimentally .    as shown in refs .  , there is a rigorous mathematical equivalence between the newton - langevin ( nl ) equation , describing a brownian particle in a periodic potential , and the stewart - mccumber ( sm ) model dealing with the superconducting phase dynamics in a small josephson junction in the presence of thermal fluctuations . in particular",
    ", a constant external force acting on a brownian particle corresponds to a constant current biasing the josephson junction , while a time - averaged velocity of the particle is equivalent to a constant voltage induced on the junction electrodes . in other words ,",
    "the relevant parameters of a brownian motor can be related to easily measurable macroscopic quantities such as a constant current and constant voltage , leading directly to the current - voltage ( @xmath0-@xmath1 ) characteristic of the josephson junction .",
    "the aim of the present paper is twofold .",
    "first , we propose a uniform method making possible to determine the absolute value of microwave current amplitude between junction electrodes , independently of the junction geometry and its coupling to the experimental setup .",
    "such a uniform approach covers a wide range of junction parameters , including two limiting cases of a `` current source '' and a `` voltage source '' model .",
    "second , we investigate the influence of a strong microwave signal on the static properties of a small josephson junction , with particular attention paid to its dynamic ( differential ) resistance . in this context",
    "we present preliminary results and explore the possibility of detecting a negative resistance ( both absolute and differential ) on the @xmath0-@xmath1 characteristic .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we discuss the equivalence between the nl and sm models .",
    "next , we recall the well - known relation between the critical current @xmath2 and the normal resistance @xmath3 of a real josephson junction , and discuss the possibility of making the junction parameters compatible with theoretical estimates",
    ". experimental details , including coupling of the junction to a microwave setup , are given in sec .",
    "iii . sec .",
    "iv deals with an experimental evaluation of rf ( microwave ) current flowing across the junction .",
    "in particular , we propose an analytical approximation making possible to determine the rf current amplitude for a wide range of junction parameters",
    ". a few examples of the current - voltage ( @xmath0-@xmath1 ) characteristics are presented in sec .",
    "v with a special attention paid to the dynamic resistance as a function of strong microwave signal .",
    "we discuss also the influence of an external magnetic field on the junction behavior and show that the superconducting phase difference @xmath4 becomes spatially modulated , making the sm model insufficient for a proper description of the junction dynamics .",
    "vi contains concluding remarks , we indicate also possible generalization to a multidimensional model of a josephson junction immersed in an external magnetic field .",
    "the chaotic dynamics of a classical brownian particle in the presence of thermal noise can be described by the inertial nl equation:@xcite @xmath5 where a dot and prime denote differentiation with respect to @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the particle mass is denoted by @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the friction coefficient , @xmath10  the angular frequency , @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote constant and alternate external forces , respectively .",
    "thermal fluctuations are described by zero - mean gaussian white noise @xmath13 with the autocorrelation function @xmath14 , @xmath15 denotes the boltzmann constant and @xmath16  temperature .",
    "if a spatially periodic potential @xmath17 is cosinusoidal , then it can be easily verified that eq .",
    "( 1 ) is formally equivalent to the sm model describing the superconducting phase dynamics of a one - dimensional small - area josephson junction @xcite @xmath18 @xmath19 where @xmath4 denotes the superconducting phase difference between electrodes and the junction is characterized by its critical current @xmath2 , capacitance @xmath20 and normal - state resistance @xmath3 .",
    "the amplitudes of the dc and ac ( microwave ) currents applied to the junction are denoted by @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "a dimensionless form of eq . ( 2 ) can be written as @xmath23 where the time has been rescaled to @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "consequently , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and the noise intensity @xmath28 .",
    "the dimensionless dc and ac amplitudes are given by @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "comparison of eq .",
    "( 3 ) with eq . ( 1 ) shows clearly that ( after appropriate scaling of eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) both models are mathematically equivalent , although the physical meaning of relevant variables is distinctly different . in particular the superconducting phase difference @xmath4 in eq . ( 2 ) corresponds to the spatial coordinate @xmath7 in eq .",
    "consequently , the average value of the time - derivative @xmath31 , proportional to the constant voltage across the junction , is analogous to the averaged velocity of a brownian particle .",
    "similarly , external current amplitudes @xmath21 and @xmath22 correspond to external forces @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the range of dimensionless parameters in which we can expect either an absolute or a differential negative resistance , is given in ref .  .",
    "thus , using the scaling of eq .",
    "( 3 ) and coming back to eq .",
    "( 2 ) it is possible to recover absolute values of the junction parameters and the external driving .    for example , the noise intensity @xmath32 implies @xmath33a at @xmath34 k. moreover , assuming @xmath35 , i.e. @xmath36 ghz we obtain the following sets of junction parameters @xmath37    the external rf current amplitude may vary , ranging from @xmath38a for the set ( a ) up to @xmath39a for the set ( b).@xcite    the main difficulty with practical application of the above parameters follows from the fact that for a real josephson junction the normal resistance @xmath3 and the critical current @xmath2 are not independent , but their product is given by:@xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes the superconducting gap energy .    for niobium at @xmath34",
    "k , we have @xmath42mev , thus the upper limit for @xmath43 can be estimated according to eq .",
    "( 5 ) as @xmath44mv . in practice , the value of @xmath43 for a real junction is lower due to inevitable defects , nevertheless it is still a few times greater than the value of @xmath43 resulting from the set of parameters ( 4 ) required by the theory .    in order to make real junction parameters compatible with theoretical predictions",
    "one can use one of two experimentally accessible methods , reducing either @xmath3 or @xmath2 . in the first case",
    ", the effective value of normal resistance can be decreased by shunting the junction with an additional resistor connected in parallel to the junction electrodes.@xcite in this work , however , we use an alterative approach to reduce the critical current @xmath2 by applying an external constant magnetic field in the junction plane .",
    "the following sets of junction parameters have been chosen for further studies : @xmath45    comparing the above parameters with theoretical predictions ( 4 ) one can see that the values of @xmath3 and @xmath20 correspond approximately to those specified previously , while the nominal critical currents @xmath2 are a few times greater than @xmath46a required by the theory . as mentioned above ,",
    "the critical current can be adjusted by applying an external magnetic field to the junction . in this manner , we are able to obtain the relevant junction parameters in agreement with those predicted theoretically .",
    "the amplitude @xmath22 of the rf current flowing across the junction is obviously proportional to @xmath47 , where @xmath48 denotes the incident microwave power .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath22 depends in a rather complicated way on the geometry of the sample holder and its coupling to the microwave source .",
    "therefore , the absolute value of @xmath22 has been determined experimentally by using the well - known relations between the effective constant current at zero voltage and the rf current amplitude @xmath22 ( see section iv for details ) .",
    "the nb - alo@xmath49-nb josephson junctions in overlap geometry have been designed and manufactured in the institute of radio engineering and electronics in moscow .",
    "the sample holder was designed as a section of a ridge waveguide of reduced impedance , which was used to improve matching of the junction to the standard @xmath50-band ( wr 42 ) waveguide and obtain a relatively large amplitude @xmath22 of the rf current .",
    "additionally , @xmath22 could be controlled by a variable short located just behind the sample holder .",
    "two superconducting coils of nearly rectangular cross - section were attached to the side walls of the sample holder , and could be used to apply a dc magnetic field of up to @xmath51 gs directed parallel to the junction plane .",
    "the measurement system consisted of a @xmath50-band klystron , followed by a ferrite isolator , ferrite modulator and calibrated attenuator .",
    "the microwave frequency could be controlled in the range 23  25 ghz and the maximum output power level was estimated as @xmath52 mw .",
    "the current - voltage ( @xmath0-@xmath1 ) characteristics were measured by a standard 4-point technique .",
    "the junction was biased by a digital current source while the voltage was measured using a digital voltmeter and recorded by a computer .",
    "all the measurements were carried out at the temperature @xmath34 k.",
    "according to the `` current source '' model @xcite we consider the following equation : @xmath53 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 as before , @xmath54 and @xmath55 . as compared to eq .",
    "( 3 ) , we use a slightly different time scaling @xmath56 and neglect both the second time - derivative and the noise term .",
    "( 7 ) has been solved numerically in several papers @xcite and it has been shown that the maximum constant current @xmath57 at zero voltage decays with increasing rf amplitude @xmath58 .",
    "however , detailed behavior of @xmath57 as a function of @xmath58 depends strongly on the frequency parameter @xmath59 . for @xmath60",
    ", we have a `` current source '' model , @xmath57 decreases linearly and @xmath61 is attained for @xmath62 . on the other hand , for @xmath63 the model tends to the `` voltage source '' with a bessel - like behavior : @xmath64 where @xmath65 denotes the bessel function of order 0 and the argument can be transformed to a simpler form by using dimensionless quantities : @xmath66     at @xmath61 plotted as a function of the normalized frequency @xmath59 .",
    "full squares denote numerical results , the dashed line shows an asymptotic linear dependence , and the solid line represents an analytical approximation ( 10 ) . ]    hence , asymptotically @xmath61 is obtained at @xmath67 , where @xmath68 denotes the first zero of the bessel function @xmath65 .",
    "1 shows the results of numerical calculations of @xmath69 as a function of @xmath59 , taken from refs .  .",
    "the dashed line denotes an asymptotic linear dependence @xmath67 and the solid line shows an analytical approximation suggested here to cover the whole range of @xmath59 : @xmath70    it is clear that the above approximation exhibits a proper behavior both for @xmath71 and @xmath63 .",
    "moreover , as shown in fig .",
    "1 , the analytical approximation ( 10 ) is in good agreement with numerical data , thus it can be used to evaluate the rf current amplitude @xmath58 also for intermediate values of @xmath59 .",
    "( full circles ) on the relative amplitude of the microwave signal @xmath72 .",
    "the dashed line shows a linear fit to the experimental data . ]    as an example , fig .",
    "2 shows an experimental dependence of @xmath57 on the relative amplitude of microwave signal @xmath72 , where @xmath73 denotes the relative microwave power .",
    "the junction parameters are slightly different from those given in eq . ( 6 ) and are equal to @xmath74 , @xmath75a , hence @xmath76 for the microwave frequency @xmath77 ghz , and according to the analytical approximation ( 10 ) we find @xmath78 .",
    "it follows from fig .",
    "2 that @xmath61 for @xmath79 what means that the absolute amplitude of the rf current at this point is equal to @xmath80a .",
    "thus , the maximum available current amplitude can be evaluated as @xmath81 ma and is far above the range of @xmath22 predicted by theoretical considerations ( see section ii ) .",
    "strictly speaking , the above analysis deals with the rsj model , since the second time - derivative has been neglected in eq .",
    "the influence of the junction capacitance on the rf current amplitude is not fully understood , however as follows from ref .  ,",
    "the estimates taking into account a nonzero capacitance yield even larger values of @xmath22 .    to conclude this section",
    ", we were able to estimate the rf current amplitude for a wide range of dimensionless parameter @xmath59 , which depends on the junction parameters and the rf frequency .",
    "in particular , it was shown that the rf amplitudes required by the theory could be easily obtained in our experimental setup .",
    "in order to study the influence of microwave radiation on the static properties of a josephson junction , we have performed a series of detailed @xmath0-@xmath1 measurements for various levels of microwave power .",
    "twelve sets of junctions have been measured with the parameters close to those given in section ii .",
    "-@xmath1 characteristics plotted as a function of incident microwave power level . ]",
    "the results obtained so far exhibit a rich variety of different phenomena which are still under investigation . here",
    "we present only a few examples , dealing mainly with the dynamical resistance of the junction in the presence of strong microwave radiation .",
    "a typical example of the @xmath0-@xmath1 characteristic measured for the sample ( a ) is presented in fig .",
    "3 , while fig . 4 shows an enlarged part of the same diagram plotted for smaller current and voltage values . according to section iv",
    ", the power level @xmath82 db corresponds to the absolute rf amplitude @xmath83a and consequently @xmath84 db denotes @xmath85a . for the set of parameters given by eq .",
    "( 4 ) , we have @xmath86 and @xmath87 . as a consequence",
    ", the shapiro steps are not observed in this region , in agreement with refs .  .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath0-@xmath1 characteristics are influenced strongly by the microwave radiation .",
    "first , we observe a step in the @xmath0-@xmath1 curve , which corresponds to a local decrease of the dynamical resistance @xmath88 from an asymptotic value @xmath89 to @xmath90 .",
    "the voltage position of this step , denoted by @xmath91 , depends linearly on the rf amplitude as shown in fig .",
    "5 .     as a function of the relative rf amplitude .",
    "experimental data are plotted as full circles and the dashed line shows a linear fit . ]",
    "the second effect of the microwave radiation is its influence on the dynamical resistance @xmath92 at zero voltage ( see fig .",
    "this time we observe rather large and irregular changes of @xmath92 ranging from a very small value @xmath93 for @xmath94 up to @xmath95 for @xmath96 .",
    "it is clear that the dependence of @xmath92 on the rf radiation is non - monotonic and for @xmath94 we observe nearly zero value of the dynamical resistance .",
    "unfortunately , contrary to theoretical predictions , so far we were not able to observe a negative dynamical resistance of the josephson junction .",
    "it seems that the main reason for a visible discrepancy between theoretical and experimental results follows from the method used to reduce the critical current of the junction .",
    "a more detailed analysis shows @xcite that applying an external magnetic field in the junction plane gives rise to a spatial modulation of the current density . in other words ,",
    "the external magnetic field makes the phase @xmath4 to become a function of spatial coordinates , in spite of the fact that we deal with small junctions whose physical dimensions are much smaller than the josephson penetration depth @xmath97 . as a consequence ,",
    "the stewart - mccumber model becomes inadequate and should be generalized to a multidimensional case , taking the form of a partial differential ( sine - gordon like ) equation : @xmath98 where @xmath99 denotes the two - dimensional laplacian , @xmath100 is a scaling parameter and @xmath101 is a function of time and two spatial coordinates .",
    "unfortunately , such a model has no counterpart in the domain of chaotic dynamical systems , hence the theoretical predictions resulting from the newton - langevin equation can not be directly applied to a josephson junction immersed in an external magnetic field .",
    "in this work we investigated the influence of high - power microwave radiation on the static characteristics of a small josephson junction . in particular , the dependence of the critical current on the microwave power level was studied , allowing to determine the absolute value of the rf ( microwave ) current flowing across the junction .",
    "it was shown that for the junction parameters as given in section ii , a `` current source '' model can be applied , leading to a simple relation @xmath102 at the point where the maximum constant current @xmath57 attains zero .    in the next step ,",
    "a dynamical resistance of the junction was investigated as a function of the rf current amplitude .",
    "in particular , it was found that the dynamical resistance at zero voltage is strongly dependent on the microwave power level and may vary in a wide range , however negative values of the resistance were not observed .",
    "as far as the correspondence between newton - langevin and stewart - mccumber models is concerned , we found that the junction parameters required by the theory were incompatible with those of really existing josephson junctions due to a natural constraint on the product of @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "as pointed out in section v , an external magnetic field applied in the junction plane may reduce the critical current , but also makes the superconducting current density to be spatially modulated . in other words ,",
    "the analogy between the nl and sm models breaks down , since the dynamics of a josephson junction immersed in an external magnetic field should be described by a more general multidimensional equation .",
