    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) at cosmological distance emit enormous amount of energy from their central region which is compact and spacially unresolved .",
    "observations of agn variability are important for the understanding of the physical mechanisms of energy emission by the central engine .",
    "monitoring observations of many agns in the optical region have been made by various authors , and the relations among agn optical variability , luminosity , redshift , time scale and so on have been derived .",
    "for example , a negative correlation between variability amplitude and luminosity was found , and the possibility of explaining the emission and variability of agn by a sub - unit model has been discussed ( e.g. , cristiani et al . 1996 ; hook et al . 1994 ) .",
    "the wavelength dependence of variability was discussed by various authors ( e.g. , cristiani et al .",
    "1997 ; winkler 1997 ; winkler et al .",
    "multi - color monitoring observations of agns are useful to distinguish the dependence of valiability on wavelength and redshift .",
    "optical variability was compared with ultraviolet variability ( clemente et al . 1996 ) , and it was concluded that the variability was larger in the shorter wavelength uv region than in the optical region .",
    "further understanding can obviously be made by combining the near - infrared ( nir ) data with the uv / optical data .",
    "barvanis ( 1992 ) analyzed the optical and nir light curves of fairall 9 ( cravel , wamsterker & glass 1989 ) , and explained the delay of nir variability , in terms of a dust reververation model , in which thermal re - radiation comes from a hot dust torus illuminated by the central emission engine .",
    "neugebauer et al .",
    "( 1988 ) monitored 108 pg quasars in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and 10@xmath18 m bands for about 20 years .",
    "it was suggested that the detection rate of variability is smaller in the nir than in the optical , if the same level of accuracy is required .",
    "we present the new data of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 variabilities for 226 agns .",
    "the sample was divided into groups by radio strength , absolute @xmath3-magnitude , and redshift , and the ensemble variability for each group was measured .",
    "our analysis in this paper was made by using the nir images of agns obtained through the procedure of image reduction discussed in paper i. differential photometry was employed to measure their nir variability .",
    "the achieved accuracy was significantly higher than the accuracy from an alternative method of standards - based photometry , as described in paper ii .",
    "only the measurements made with more than two reference objects and having an accuracy higher than 0.1 mag are used in this paper .",
    "the agns in our sample were selected from various versions of the quasars and active galactic nuclei catalog ( vv catalog , veron - cetty and veron 1993 , 1996 , 1998 ) .",
    "agns were selected with consideration of their use in the magnum project ( kobayashi et al .",
    "1998a , 1998b ) .",
    "the distribution of declination and right ascention for all agns in the sample is shown in fig . 1 of paper i. the distribution of absolute @xmath3-magnitude and redshift is shown in fig . 2 of paper i.",
    "all observations were made with the 1.3 m infrared telescope at the institute of space and astronautical science ( isas ) , japan , equipped with the nir picnic camera ( kobayashi et al .",
    "the agns and reference objects were imaged in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands with the telescope stepped in a raster pattern .",
    "two photometric standard stars with different elevations were observed three times each night ( for details see  2 of paper i ) .    the picred software , that was developed for the picnic camera ,",
    "was used to reduce the images . during our observations",
    "this software was optimized for agn and quasar images , to achieve fully automated reductions ( for details see  3 of paper i ) .",
    "since each agn was observed on two different nights separated by a year or more , the variability thus obtained does not necessarily reflect the characteristic amplitude of intrinsic variability .",
    "therefore , we discuss the ensemble variability of agns which reflects the dispersion of their individual variabilities . however , the standard deviation of such data is not a good parameter in estimating the agn variability , because not only the intrinsic agn variability but also measurement errors broaden the distribution .",
    "we here introduce the ensemble variability , after excluding the contribution of measurement errors , as @xmath19 and its error given by @xmath20 derivation of @xmath21 and @xmath22 is described in appendix [ apnd_v ] . in the remainder of this paper",
    "these quantities of @xmath21 and @xmath22 are used to discuss the variability of the agns in our sample .",
    "we examine whether the variability is correlated with the parameters such as radio strength , rest - frame time interval of observations , absolute @xmath3-magnitude , redshift , seyfert type , and nir colors .",
    "first , the sample was divided by each parameter into two groups , `` @xmath23 '' and `` @xmath24 '' , at a point where there appeared to be a boundary on either side of which the data are separated .",
    "then , the ensemble variabilities for these two groups were compared with each other .",
    "the agns in our sample are distinguished by the radio strength or the ratio of radio 6 cm flux relative to optical @xmath25-band flux @xmath26 .",
    "the agns with @xmath27 were classified into the radio - quiet group , and others with @xmath28 into the radio - loud group .",
    "the agns , observed twice separated by time interval @xmath29 , were distinguished by the rest - frame time interval @xmath30 .",
    "the agns with 100 days @xmath31400 days were classified into the short-@xmath32 group , and others with 400 days @xmath31 800 days into the long-@xmath33 group .",
    "the boundary at 400 days reflects the period in which the agns were observed .",
    "our observational runs consist of three periods ( january 1996@xmath34april 1996 , november 1996@xmath34february 1997 , december 1997@xmath34april 1998 ) .",
    "the agns observed in the first and third periods are mainly of long interval , and those in the second and third periods are of short interval .",
    "the agns with @xmath35 were classified into the bright group , and those with @xmath36 into the faint group .",
    "the agns with @xmath15 are classified into the low-@xmath5 group , and those with @xmath14 into the high-@xmath5 group .",
    "the agns with seyfert 1 , 1.2 , and 1.5 were classified into the early - type seyfert group , and others with 1.8 , 1.9 , and 2 into the late - type seyfert group .",
    "the agns with @xmath37 and those with @xmath38 were classified into the blue group , and others with @xmath39 and @xmath40 into the red group .",
    "the ensemble variabilities for the `` @xmath23 '' and `` @xmath24 '' groups are derived for each of radio strength , rest - frame time interval of observations , absolute @xmath3-magnitude , redshift , seyfert type , and nir colors .",

    "the last column of this table represents the average ratio taken over the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 bands .",
    "the average ratio between the radio - loud and radio - quiet groups is 1.46 , which is the largest .",
    "the average ratio for the long- and short-@xmath33 groups is 1.24 , while it is 1.20 for the bright- and faint-@xmath4 groups .",
    "the average ratios for other quantities are much closer to unity .",

    "1 shows that the ensemble variability in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , or @xmath2 band is @xmath42 , estimated for the entire sample , while @xmath43 and @xmath44 for the radio - quiet and radio - loud groups , respectively .",

    "the similar results for the radio - loud agns are shown in fig .",
    "a statistical test on the wavelength dependence of @xmath49 was done by applying the @xmath50 method to the result . since such dependence",
    "was not found to be significant , it is reasonable to adopt a two - parameter function of @xmath51 and search for the solution near @xmath52 in minimizing @xmath53 .",

    "a similar result holds if the radio - quiet sample is further divided by @xmath33 . for other groups , the c.l",
    "range becomes wider , so that the ability of rejecting the hypothesis of no wavelength - dependence by the test remarkably decreases .      in this section , using the ensemble variability @xmath21 averaged over the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 bands , we examin whether @xmath21 depends on radio strength , @xmath33 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 . in this case , with a simple one - parameter function of @xmath61 , it is reduced to @xmath62 .",
    "table 3 shows the optimized value of @xmath63 together with @xmath64 which represents the reliability of rejecting the hypothesis that @xmath21 does not depend on the parameter in question .",
    "it is understood from this table that the statistical equivalence of @xmath21 between the radio - quiet and radio - loud samples is rejected by a level of @xmath65 . for the radio - quiet sample further divided by @xmath33 , the statistical equivalence of @xmath66 between the short and long @xmath33",
    "is also rejected by a level of @xmath65 .",
    "for the radio - loud sample , however , such statistical equivalence is rejected only by @xmath67 .    for the radio - quiet sample with short @xmath33 ,",
    "the test for the @xmath4-dependence gives @xmath68 by which it is difficult to conclude with certainty that @xmath21 depends on @xmath4 .",
    "the same test for @xmath5-dependence gives @xmath69 , indicating a rather strong @xmath5-dependence of @xmath21 .",
    "for the radio - loud sample with short @xmath33 , both @xmath4-dependence and @xmath5-dependence are highly significant .",
    "we note that such strong @xmath4-dependence is in clear contrast with the result for the radio - quiet sample , and such strong @xmath5-dependence is similar to the result for the radio - quiet sample .",
    "figure 4 shows the relations among various parameters for the radio - quiet sample . in the left column , from top to bottom , are shown the values of @xmath21 , @xmath33 , and @xmath4 , estimated in four @xmath5-bins between @xmath70 and 1 .",
    "similarly , in the right column , from top to bottom , are shown the values of @xmath21 , @xmath33 , and @xmath5 , estimated in four @xmath4-bins between @xmath71 and @xmath72 . in this figure ,",
    "open and filled squares represent the samples with short and long @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "we see from the left column that @xmath21 , @xmath33 and @xmath4 decrease with increasing @xmath5 , except for the case of @xmath66 in the lowest-@xmath5 bin .",
    "these trends with @xmath5 are equivalently converted to the trends with @xmath4 , as shown in the right column , by using the monotonical @xmath5 versus @xmath4 relation .",
    "we caution that the @xmath5-dependence of @xmath33 may only be apparent , arising from the cosmological time delay @xmath73 applied to our sample which has a rather limited range of @xmath29 .",
    "consequently , any trends with @xmath74 may also be apparent .",
    "the ensemble nir variability of radio - quiet agns is as small as @xmath75 , showing little @xmath4-dependence in this work .",
    "we note that faint agns , mostly at low @xmath5 , are contaminated by a host galaxy component , which is indicated by our multi - aperture color analysis ( paper i ; see also kotilainen & ward 1994 ) . since the host galaxy component is stellar and",
    "does not vary on a time scale of years , such contamination has the systematic effect of weakening the agn variability .",
    "therefore , @xmath21 , after correction for this effect , would still have little or negative correlation with absolute @xmath3-luminosity , depending on the degree of contamination within chosen aperture size .",
    "the above @xmath4-dependence of @xmath21 is expected from the model of dust reverberation in which brighter agns have a larger dust torus .",
    "that is , a variation in the uv / optical light emitted from the central engine is absorbed in more extended region of dust from which the nir radiation is emitted and the spread in arrival times of the nir variation from this extended region produces a variation with smaller amplitude .",
    "therefore , regardless of the real emission mechanism of central source , the nir variability would show only small correlation with @xmath4 , as observed .",
    "next , we consider the radio - loud agns .",
    "figure 5 shows their relations among @xmath21 , @xmath33 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , in a similar way as in fig .",
    "we divide the radio - loud sample into the short and long @xmath74 .",
    "however , because of the lack of enough data , the values of @xmath21 and @xmath33 are not estimated as a function of @xmath5 or @xmath4 , for the case of long @xmath33 .",
    "we notice that @xmath21 for the radio - loud agns , in the case of short @xmath33 , strongly increases with increasing @xmath5 or with increasing absolute @xmath3-luminosity , opposite to that for the radio - quiet agns .",
    "if we assume that such positive correlation is only apparent , wishing to explain it in terms of the effect of contamination of host galaxy component , we have to invoke an extremely different contribution from the host galaxies between radio - loud and radio - quiet agns , which is difficult to justify .",
    "therefore , it is more reasonable to conclude that the different @xmath4-dependence of @xmath21 reflects the different emission and variability mechanisms between radio - loud and radio - quiet agns .      in this section",
    "the correlation among the variabilities in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 bands is discussed using only the data of estimated variabilities with more than two reference stars and an accuracy better than 0.1 mag .",
    "the results for the radio - quiet and radio - loud agns are shown in figs . 6 and 7 , respectively , where @xmath76 is plotted against @xmath77 , @xmath78 against @xmath76 , and @xmath78 against @xmath77 .",
    "open and filled symbols correspond to long and short @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "the data distribute , more or less , along the diagonal running from lower left to upper right through the origin , which indicates that agns , becoming brighter in one band , become brighter in the other band , and vice versa .",
    "it is seen from each panel that more data are plotted in the lower left region than in the upper right region . however , this is not real because agns , becoming fainter , are likely to be either undetected or rejected by our accuracy requirement .",
    "the correlation coefficient of variabilities in two different bands , say @xmath0 and @xmath1 , is defined as @xmath79 where @xmath80 ( @xmath81 or @xmath1 ) is the unweighted average of variability data in each band .",
    "table 4 tabulates the values of @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 for the entire sample , for which the 68.3% confident interval is about 0.1 or less .",
    "the coefficient is higher than + 0.59 for the radio - quiet sample , and even higher than + 0.8 for the radio - loud sample .",
    "figure 8 shows the @xmath5-dependence of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 . for the radio - quiet sample , all these coefficients at @xmath85",
    "are equally high . while @xmath9 keeps a high value irrespective of @xmath5 , the coefficients @xmath11 and @xmath10 are getting smaller for higher @xmath5 .",
    "this trend may have occurred from an underestimation of the correlation , because of lower statistical accuracy in the high-@xmath5 sample of smaller size , and because of larger errors in @xmath21 for the high-@xmath5 sample consisting mainly of faint agns . for the radio - loud sample ,",
    "all the coefficients keep a high value irrespective of @xmath5 and their accuracy becomes higher for higher @xmath5 , in sharp contrast with the radio - quiet sample .",
    "the equivalence of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 was tested against the estimated true value of coefficient @xmath86 .",
    "table 5 tabulates the estimation of @xmath86 together with @xmath64 which represents the reliability of rejecting the hypothesis that @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are equivalent to each other . for the radio - quiet sample ,",
    "their equivalence at @xmath87 is significantly rejected , while not definitely so at higher @xmath5 .",
    "for the radio - loud sample , the equivalence at @xmath14 is rejected with negligible reliability , in other words , it is very probable that @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are the same at @xmath14 .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 for the radio - quiet sample are equally high at @xmath85 , and @xmath10 is higher than @xmath9 and @xmath11 at @xmath87 . in dust reverberation model",
    ", the nir flux of agns is mainly emitted from hot dust which is heated up to the evaporation temperature @xmath88k ( e.g. , kobayashi et al . 1993 ) .",
    "the equivalence of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 at @xmath85 can be explained by the black body radiation with constant @xmath89k dominating on the longer - wavelength region of the 1@xmath90 minimum seen in the rest - frame sed of agns and quasars . on the other hand ,",
    "the main variable component dominating on the shorter - wavelength region of the 1@xmath90 minimum is considered to be a power - law component , and its variability is not necessarily synchronized with the nir variability .",
    "figure 9 shows this non - synchronization between uv / optical and nir variabilities on either sides of 1@xmath90 in rest frame .",
    "thereby , at @xmath87 , the correlation of variabilities between the @xmath0 band and longer wavelengths becomes weak , because the 1@xmath90 minimum in the rest frame moves to the @xmath0 band and the power - law variable component affects the flux there . at @xmath14 , the 1@xmath18 m minimum moves in between the @xmath1 and @xmath2 band . in such case , @xmath9 is kept high , determined mainly by the the power - law variable component , while @xmath10 and @xmath11 become low , determined by both the power - law and black - body components .    for the radio - loud sample , however , the obseved trends of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are very different from those for the radio - quiet sample and",
    "may be explained by a mechanism of variability other than dust reverberation .      in this section",
    "we consider the relation between the time scale and other parameters that characterize the variability of agns . for pedagogical purpose ,",
    "we introduce two representative functions to be fitted to our nir data : @xmath91 and @xmath92 these functions correspond to a divergent increase of variability and an asymptotic increase with increasing @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "tables 6a and 6b tabulate the fitted values of the parameters and their 95% and 99% confidence intervals , applied to the agns in the entire sample as well as the radio - quiet and radio - loud samples . the curves with such fitted values are shown in fig . 10 . we note that @xmath94 and @xmath95 are searched for in their postive values to avoid division by 0 at @xmath96 in equations 4 and 5 . if their fitted values or the lower limits of their confidence intervals became negative , they were given the value of zero .",
    "all the fitted curves are accepted independent of how the data are divided into subgroups .",
    "thus , it is difficult to prefer the function in equation 4 to the other in equation 5 .",
    "however , it is generally suggested from tables 6a and 6b that @xmath94 and @xmath95 for the radio - loud sample are smaller than those for the radio - quiet sample , which indicates that the time scale of nir variability of radio - loud agns is shorter than that for the radio - quiet agns .",
    "figure 11 shows the fitted values of @xmath94 and @xmath95 in comparison with those obtained by cristiani et al .",
    "( 1996 ) from the optical variability data in the literature .",
    "the vertical errorbar is for the 68.3% confidence interval , and the horizontal errorbar for the covered range of wavelengths .",
    "it is interesting to see that the time scale of optical variability by cristiani et al .",
    "( 1996 ) agrees , within the range of uncertainties , with the time scale of nir variability for the radio - quiet sample . on the contrary , this is not the case for the radio - loud sample , where the time scale of optical variability is significantly longer than the time scale of nir variability .    from the viewpoint of dust reverberation ,",
    "it is natural that the nir variability occurs on a rather elongated time scale , because the uv / optical variability is re - emitted in the nir from a more extended region of dust producing a spread of arrival times .",
    "consequently , whether the nir variability occurs as fast as or faster than the uv / optical variability gives a clue which limits or rejects a mechanism of variability based upon the dust reverberation model . in this regard , it is difficult to explain by the dust reverberation model how the nir variability of the radio - loud agns occurs faster than the optical variability , as seen from the comparison in fig .",
    "we have highlighted the difference of nir variability between the radio - quiet and radiou - loud agns .",
    "obtained features for these respective samples are summarized as follows :    \\(1 ) the amplitude of ensemble nir variability @xmath21 in the radio - quiet sample is smaller than in the radio - loud sample .",
    "\\(2 ) the wavelength - dependence of @xmath21 in the nir region is not found in both the radio - quiet and radio - loud samples .",
    "\\(3 ) no correlation is found between @xmath21 and @xmath4 in the radio - quiet sample , but a negative correlation is suggested if corrected for the effect of possible contamination of a host galaxy component . on the other hand , a positive correlation is found between @xmath21 and @xmath4 in the radio - loud sample .",
    "\\(4 ) the correlation coeficient @xmath97 between the @xmath1 and @xmath16 variabilities at @xmath87 is significantly higher than @xmath9 and @xmath11 in the radio - quiet sample .",
    "on the other hand , the coeficients @xmath9 , @xmath11 and @xmath10 at @xmath14 have a high value of @xmath98 in the radio - loud sample .",
    "\\(5 ) the time scale of nir variability in the radio - quiet sample is longer than in the radio - loud sample .",
    "the features of 2 , 3 , and 4 for the radio - quiet agns are consistent with those expected from a mechanism of variability by dust reverberation . furthermore , the feature of 5 for the radio - quiet agns , if combined with the time scale of optical variability by cristiani et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , is also consistent with dust reverberation .",
    "however , the features of 2 to 5 for the radio - loud agns are not explained consistently by dust reverberation .",
    "a non - thermal variable component , as a substitute of thermal radiation from hot dust , is worth considering . for example , sanders et al . ( 1989 ) proposed such a non - thermal component which would vary more strongly and faster in the compact region than the thermal radiation from an extended hot dust torus .",
    "we proceed with the working hypothesis such that dust reverberation is responsible for the emission and variability of radio - quiet agns , while a non - thermal variable component is responsible for the emission and variability of radio - loud agns . in the next subsections",
    ", we check the plausibility of this hypothesis using additional data from the literature .",
    "it is known that the time delay of nir variability lagged behind the the uv / optical variability is a key prediction of the dust reverberation model .",
    "therefore , measurements of uv / optical and nir light curves , based on multi - wavelength monitoring observations of agns , immediately reject or justify the application of the dust reverberation model to individual agns .    the agns with measured time delay , to which the dust reverberation model is successfully applied ,",
    "are taken from the literature , and their data of @xmath5 , @xmath4 , and @xmath26 are summarized in table 7 .",
    "it is evident that these agns are classified as radio - quiet with @xmath27 .",
    "the sample of these agns is heterogeneous and is far from complete .",
    "it is possible that the sample is biased in favor of nearby and/or radio - quiet agns .",
    "the first systematic monitoring observations of many seyfert 1 agns and quasars in the @xmath25 and @xmath16 bands were performed by nelson ( 1996a ) .",
    "table 8 shows the statistics based on nelson s sample consisting of 51 program agns .",
    "the first row represents the numbers of radio - quiet and radio - loud agns in his entire sample of 51 agns , the second row for the subsample of 33 agns which were found to vary in both the @xmath25 and @xmath16 bands , and the third row for the subsample of 6 agns for which the time delay of the @xmath16-band variability relative to the @xmath25-band variability were measured .",
    "we see that the agns with measured time delay , which are best explained by the simple dust reverberation model , are always classified as radio - quiet . in other words ,",
    "radio - quiet agns are potential targets for multi - wavelength monitoring from which the time delay between the nir and uv / optical variabilities can certainly be measured .",
    "the large and fast nir variability of radio - loud agns found in this paper is not explained by dust reverberation model . in order to understand what causes such variability",
    ", we further classify the radio - loud agns with respect to their spectral feature in the radio region , being either flat ( @xmath99 ) or steep ( @xmath100 ) , if fitted to a power - law form of @xmath101 ( sanders et al . 1989 ) .",
    "the values of power index @xmath102 in our sample were determined using the data of radio fluxes at 6 cm and 11 cm taken from the vv catalog .",
    "figure 12 shows that @xmath102 is not correlated with @xmath4 or @xmath5 .",
    "figure 13 shows that the ensemble variability in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 bands is @xmath103 for the radio - loud and flat - spectrum agns , which is systematically higher than @xmath45 for the radio - loud and steep - spectrum agns .",
    "it is therefore the flat component that actually brings about the large and fast nir variability .    the radio spectral index , @xmath102 ,",
    "is known to be well correlated with the radio - loud agn morphology ; while the steep spectrum is associated with extended lobe - dominant sources , the flat spectrum is associated with core - dominant variable sources such as ovvs , highly polarized qsos , and bl lacs .",
    "thereby , it is reasonable to conclude that a non - thermal variable component , as exemplified by non - thermal emissions from such objects ( e.g. , robson et al .",
    "1993 ; bloom et al . 1994 ) , is responsible for occurrence of features of the nir variability found for the radio - loud agns in this paper .",
    "we presented comprehensive study of nir variability of 226 agns based on multiple observations in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 bands .",
    "our sample consists mainly of seyfert 1 agns and qsos . about a quarter of objects in each category",
    "are radio loud .",
    "the agns in the entire sample have redshifts spanning a range from @xmath70 to 1 , and the absolute @xmath3-magnitudes from @xmath104 to @xmath72 .",
    "based on the method of differential photometry , we find that the ensemble nir variability for the entire sample of agns is typically @xmath45 mag .",
    "when the sample is divided by radio strength , the variability for the radio - quiet sample is systematically smaller than that for the radio - loud sample .",
    "no clear wavelength - dependence of @xmath21 in the nir region is found for either the radio - quiet or radio - loud sample , in sharp contrast with the uv / optical result in the literature .",
    "we examined the dependence of @xmath21 on various quantities such as radio strength , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , with special attention as to whether their ensemble variability would support or reject the simple - minded dust reverberation model for agns .",
    "the radio - quiet agns show no significant correlation between @xmath21 and @xmath4 , although negative correlation is suggested if corrected for the effect of possible contamination by a host galaxy component . on the other hand ,",
    "the radio - loud agns show a positive correlation between @xmath21 and @xmath4 .    the radio - quiet agns give a significantly higher correlation coefficient @xmath97 between the @xmath1 and @xmath16 variabilities at @xmath87 , when comapred to @xmath9 and @xmath11 . on the other hand ,",
    "the radio - loud agns give a high value of @xmath98 to all the coefficients @xmath9 , @xmath11 and @xmath10 at @xmath14 .",
    "time development of ensemble variability is examined using heuristic functions .",
    "the time scale of nir variability for the radio - quiet agns in this paper is not shorter than the time scale of uv / optical variability given in the literature .",
    "however , the time scale of nir variability of the radio - loud agns is significantly shorter than the time scale of their uv / optical variability .",
    "all the features of nir variability for the radio - quiet agns are consistent with those expected from the dust reverberation model .",
    "however , it is difficult for this simple - minded model to explain the features of the radio - loud agns , and a non - thermal variable component is suggested as a viable candidate for causing the large and fast nir variability of the radio - loud agns .",

    "we thank the staff of the advanced technology center of the national astronomical observatory of japan ( naoj ) for their new coating of the mirror of the 1.3 m telescope at the isas .",

    "this section describes how we estimate variability and its error in this work using the data for which the sample number and accuracy are both limited .",
    "the data obtained in this work are given in the format of @xmath105 , @xmath106 ... @xmath107 for the sample of agn@xmath108 , agn@xmath109 ... agn@xmath110 .",
    "here , @xmath111 and @xmath112 represent the variability and its error of the @xmath113-th object .",
    "hereafter , the real variability of the @xmath113-th object is described as @xmath114 , and the difference between @xmath114 and @xmath111 is given by @xmath115 .",
    "then , @xmath115 can be regarded as a random variable described by the normal distribution having zero average and the standard deviation @xmath116 , that is , @xmath117 where @xmath118 represents the expectation .",
    "the real variability of the @xmath113-th object @xmath114 is assumed to be a random variable that follows the normal distribution with zero average and the standard deviation @xmath119 independent of @xmath113 .    in the ideal case where the data have zero error and",
    "the sample size is infinite , the dispersion of variability is given by @xmath120   \\label{eq_ideal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hereafter , the aim is to estimate the value of equation [ eq_ideal ] and the error from the existing data . consider @xmath121 then , the expectation of the second term in the right - hand side vanishes because @xmath114 and @xmath115 are independent of each other .",
    "therefore , the expectation of @xmath122 becomes @xmath123 substitution of the observed data into equation [ eq_ideal ] gives @xmath124    \\sim \\frac { \\sum^n_{i}v^2_i}{n }     \\sim \\frac{\\sum^n_i \\delta m^2_i - \\sum^n_i \\sigma^2_i}{n}\\label{eq_ap_sf2 }     \\equiv \\overline{v^2_0},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first @xmath125 stems from the finite sample number and the second @xmath125 stems from the error of the data .",
    "the overline of @xmath126 indicates that the value is the expectation based on the exisiting data .",
    "the error of equation [ eq_ap_sf2 ] is estimated as follows : first , we focus on the error caused by the deviation of the ideal expectation from that of the actual data with finite sample number .",
    "it should be noticed that @xmath127 is the random variable described by the @xmath50 distribution with @xmath128 degrees of freedom . since @xmath129 @xmath130 is a random variable that follows the normal distribution with zero average and the standard deviation of unity , the expectation @xmath127 is equal to @xmath128 with the dispersion of @xmath131 .",
    "therefore , the error of equation [ eq_ap_sf2 ] arising from the finite sample number is estimated as @xmath132 .",
    "we next focus on the error caused by the deviation of the ideal expectation from that of the actual data with non - zero error .",
    "assuming that @xmath114 and @xmath115 are independent of each other , the difference between @xmath122 and @xmath133 is calculated as @xmath134 where equation [ eq_e1e2 ] is used .",
    "using equation [ eq_v2 ] and @xmath135 , equation [ eq_disp ] furthermore reduces to @xmath136 therefore , the error of equation [ eq_ap_sf2 ] arising from the non - zero error of the variability data is estimated as @xmath137 . using equation [ eq_ap_sf2 ] and the above error estimates ,",
    "the expectation value of @xmath138 and its error are estimated as @xmath139 finally , using the usual error propagation , the expectation value of @xmath119 and its error are estimated as @xmath140^{-1/2 }          \\sqrt{\\frac{2(\\sum^n_i \\delta   m^2_i-\\sum^2_i\\sigma^2_i)^2}{n^3}+\\frac{\\sum^n_i(4\\delta   m^2_i\\sigma^2_i-2\\sigma^4_i)}{n^2 } } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]                          kobayashi , y. , yoshii , y. , peterson , bruce a. , miyazaki , s. , aoki , t. , minezaki , t. , kawara , k. , enya , k. , okada , n. , suganuma , m. , greene , b. , obrien , m. , randall , and lawrence k. 1998a , proc .",
