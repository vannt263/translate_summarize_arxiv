    "relaxor ferroelectrics are intriguing materials that characteristically exhibit a broad frequency - dependent dielectric response  @xcite .",
    "although relaxors were discovered more than fifty years ago  @xcite the precise origin of their peculiar dielectricity remains controversial .",
    "various models have been proposed ( e.g. , refs . @xcite and references therein )",
    "all of which include quenched , randomly distributed , internal electric fields and/or interacting polar microregions .",
    "experimentally , the introduction of vacancies into relaxors induces greater broadening of the dielectric response ; i.e. it _ enhances _ relaxor character @xcite .",
    "other pb - vacancy induced effects include : shifting of the dielectric peak to lower temperature ; a decrease in the magnitude of the dielectric response ; and a more `` diffuse '' phase transition @xcite .",
    "the mechanisms responsible for vacancy - induced characteristics are mostly unknown , but understanding them would illuminate the fundamentals of relaxor behavior , especially because defects are always present in real samples .",
    "one reason for this paucity of knowledge is that first - principles studies of ( point ) defects in ferroelectrics are scarce @xcite .    in this manuscript",
    ", we investigate the effects of pb - vacancies on the properties of a relaxor ferroelectric from first principles .",
    "our model system is pb(sc@xmath0nb@xmath0)o@xmath1 ( psn ) rather than the prototype relaxor pb(mg@xmath2nb@xmath3)o@xmath4 ( pmn ) , because the former is easier to model ",
    "i.e. finite - temperature first - principles - based models already exist for psn @xcite but not for pmn .",
    "note that , unlike pmn which retains relaxor character down to 0k",
    "( i.e. exhibits no ferroelectric phase transition ) , chemically disordered psn exhibits relaxor behavior between @xmath5 400k and @xmath5 368k , then transforms to a rhombohedral ferroelectric phase  @xcite .",
    "we focus on static properties , because studying the dynamics of relaxors from first - principles is not currently feasible .",
    "our study clarifies the origin(s ) of the vacancy - induced effects mentioned above , and suggests that the common wisdom that pb - vacancies reduce the magnitude of dielectric response should be reconsidered .",
    "this manuscript is organized as follows : section ii describes the method .",
    "section iii presents and discusses results .",
    "section iv is a brief summary .",

    "we solve this effective hamiltonian by the monte carlo ( mc ) technique @xcite to simulate properties of two different systems : 1 ) disordered pb(sc@xmath0nb@xmath0)o@xmath1   _ without any pb - vacancies _ , psn - d ; 2 ) disordered pb@xmath33(sc@xmath0nb@xmath0)o@xmath1 , psn - dv , which has a realistic 5% vacancy concentration on its a - sites  @xcite ) .",

    "we collect the supercell - average @xmath37 of the local distortion at each sweep and classify it as _ visiting _ one of the eight rhombohedral , twelve orthorhombic , or six tetragonal energy minima by computing its projection onto each of these twenty - six high - symmetry directions .",

    "thus , our model qualitatively reproduces the previous finding that pb - vacancies reduce @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "our quantitative prediction of a 6.5 % reduction in t@xmath50 , from the introduction of 5% pb - vacancies agrees rather well with the corresponding experimental reduction of 8.5% @xcite , and is also consistent with the @xmath51 2.6% reduction of t@xmath50 associated with 1.7% pb - vacancies @xcite ; establishing the accuracy of simulations based on eqs .",

    "note that eq.(2 ) can be rewritten as @xmath52 \\ $ ] , with @xmath53 ; that is , @xmath54 has the dimensions and physical meaning of an internal electric field arising from the pb - vacancies .",
    "our first - principles - derived values for the fields around a pb - vacancy are of the order of 1.4  @xmath55  v / m at each neighboring b - site @xmath13 .",
    "these fields are oriented towards the vacancy because @xmath28 is positive and @xmath54 depends on the directional @xmath56 vectors ; @xmath54 is therefore rather large and _ inhomogeneous _ , and thus significantely _ opposes _ homogeneous ferroelectric @xmath57 ordering , which explains the vacancy - induced reduction of t@xmath50 .",

    "we smoothed the results for @xmath70 by fitting them to a 7th - order polynomial in the region around @xmath49 ( lines in fig .",
    "we denote the result by @xmath71 and recompute the susceptibility as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the 0k cubic lattice constant .",

    "interestingly , fig .",
    "1b indicates that , contrary to common wisdom and previously reported observations @xcite , our predicted maximum value of the dielectric response does _ not _ decrease when pb - vacancies are introduced : our simulations indicate that @xmath77 is slightly larger in psn - dv than in psn - d at @xmath78 , because t@xmath50 is smaller and @xmath71 is further away from @xmath65 in psn - dv , see fig .",
    "1a and eq .",
    "[ our predicted maximum values for @xmath77 are about 34,000 and 38,500 for psn - d and psn - dv , respectively , which is close to the measured value @xmath51 40,000 of ref .",
    "@xcite for psn - d ] .",
    "this result , which appears to be at odds with measurements , is explained by the experimental observation of ref .",
    "@xcite that pb - vacancies in pb(sc@xmath0nb@xmath0)o@xmath1 favor the simultaneous formation of pyrochlore phases ( pb@xmath79nb@xmath80o@xmath81 and pb@xmath4nb@xmath82o@xmath83 ) .",
    "thus , dielectric measurements on a psn - dv sample at @xmath78 should yield a _",
    "smaller _ response than those on psn - d ; because , while the majority of the psn - dv sample is perovskite , with a dielectric response that is at least as large as that for psn - d , a smaller fraction is pyrochlore , which has a much _ smaller _ dielectric response @xcite .",
    "figure 1b also shows that our simulations successfully reproduce two experimental observations : ( i ) the _ broadened _ dielectric peaks in psn - d and psn - dv , which are characteristic of relaxors  @xcite , and according to eq .",

    "@xcite for the `` normal '' ferroelectric system pb(zr@xmath84ti@xmath85)o@xmath4 ] .",
    "note that vacancy - induced dielectric broadening only occurs _ below _ t@xmath50 .",
    "this is particularly clear in the fig .",
    "1b inset , in which the @xmath77   of psn - dv is rescaled by a t - independent constant to match the @xmath77   dielectric response of psn - d at @xmath78 .    to clarify how psn - dv differs from psn - d only at temperatures below t@xmath50 , table",
    "i lists the internal energies of rhombohedral and orthorhombic minima ( calculated at 5k ) ; plus the visiting rates of these minima in both psn - d and psn - dv at @xmath87 . the energy landscape of psn - d is rather anisotropic ; e.g. the energy difference between the ground state and the highest - lying rhombohedral minimum is 0.68  mev .",
    "reference @xcite demonstrated that such local symmetry breaking is caused by the anisotropy of the large internal @xmath26 electric fields ( which have an average magnitude @xmath51 2 @xmath55  v / m ; determined numerically ) that arise from the charge - difference between sc@xmath88   and nb@xmath89   ions .",
    "this anisotropy results from our nanometric periodic psn - d supercell being too small to contain a perfectly random b - site configuration @xcite .",
    "results in table i also indicate that , at @xmath87 , psn - d preferentially visits the rhombohedral [ -111 ] and [ 111 ] minima , i.e. the minima that have _ lowest _ energies , and that are connected by one of the lowest - in - energy orthorhombic minima ( specifically , [ 011 ] ) .",
    "such fluctuations lead to a @xmath71 that is smaller than @xmath65 , and thus [ eq .  ( 5 ) ] , to a large dielectric response relative to normal ferroelectrics ( which are already stuck in a single minimum at @xmath87 @xcite ) . as indicated by table",
    "i , the @xmath54 electric field associated with pb - vacancies ( see rewriting of eq  ( 2 ) above ) brings the orthorhombic and rhombohedral minima closer to each other ; similar to the finding of ref .",
    "@xcite that @xmath26 in psn - d reduces barriers between energy minima .",
    "thus , psn - dv fluctuates more and/or visits more minima than psn - d at temperatures below t@xmath50 .",
    "this implies a smaller @xmath71 ( fig .",
    "1a ) and therefore naturally explains two vacancy - induced effects that have been observed experimentally @xcite : a broader psn - dv dielectric response ( fig .",
    "1b and eq .",
    "( 5 ) ) ; and a more diffuse psn - dv phase transition ( psn - dv `` only '' begins to stick in a single rhombohedral minimum at @xmath90 as indicated by the equality @xmath91 at and below this temperature , fig  1a , whereas , freezing in of psn - d occurs at @xmath92 ) .",
    "results in table i also indicate that the most frequently visited rhombohedral minima in psn - dv are _ not _ the lowest - energy minima ; rather they are those with small - in - energy rhombohedral - to - orthorhombic barriers ( e.g. , the [ 1 - 1 - 1 ] and [ -1 - 1 - 1 ] minima that are connected by the [ 0 - 1 - 1 ] minimum , over an energy barrier of about 2.5 mev ) .",
    "this strongly suggests that relaxors with pb - vacancies can be thought of as non - ergodic systems @xcite .",
    "in summary , first - principles - based calculations predict that the introduction of pb - vacancies in pb(sc@xmath0nb@xmath0)o@xmath1 : ( i ) reduces the temperature at which the dielectric response peaks , @xmath93  , consistent with experiment @xcite ; ( ii ) does _ not intrinsically _ decrease the magnitude of the dielectric peak , contrary to common wisdom @xcite ; ( iii ) broadens the dielectric response and enhances the diffuse character of the ferroelectric transition , consistent with measurements @xcite ( but only at temperatures below t@xmath50 ) . item ( i ) above is the direct consequence of the relatively large internal inhomogeneous electric fields generated by the pb - vacancies .",
    "we suggest that our disagreement with experiments in item ( ii ) is caused by parasitic pyrochlore phases in the experimental samples .",
    "item ( iii ) originates from the decrease in energy barriers that are caused by pb - vacancies , which promote enhanced fluctuations between different energy - minima below t@xmath50 .",
