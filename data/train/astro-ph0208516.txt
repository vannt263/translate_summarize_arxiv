    "_ fuse _ ( moos et al . 2000 ; sahnow et al . 2000 ) observations of bd+30@xmath13639 and swst  1 were obtained for general investigator ( gi ) programs a085 and b069 ( p.i .",

    "ngc  3132 was observed for program p133 ( p.i .",

    "the _ fuse _ data and observational information may be accessed from the mast archive at the space telescope science institute under the indicated gi programs .",
    "the individual exposures were calibrated with calfuse  v2.0.5 , and all exposures for a given object were cross - correlated and co - added to increase the signal - to - noise ratio s / n .",
    "we based our subsequent analysis on the detector segments with the highest s / n in the salient wavelength regions : lif  2a for @xmath01088.46 and the lines at @xmath61122 - 1132 , and lif  1a for  @xmath610121021 . in cases of overlapping coverage , the results were reasonably consistent in both detector segments .",
    "the spectra were rebinned by 3 pixels , increasing the s / n near 1088   to 1525 per rebinned sample , and broadening the sampling interval from @xmath7  7  m  to @xmath7  20  m .",
    "the continua were normalized and flattened by fitting low - order legendre polynomials to the continuum shape and dividing them out .",

    "the dotted vertical lines indicate nebular absorption velocities from ( dinerstein et al .",
    "1995 ) or from other lines in the fuse spectrum .    in table  1 we summarize the values of central velocity @xmath10 and equivalent width w@xmath11 from the line fits .",
    "the doppler widths @xmath12 are poorly determined because they are small compared to the _ fuse _ instrumental resolution element ; typical fitted values were @xmath1310  km  s@xmath8 .",
    "the errors are 1@xmath14 values based on uncertainties in continuum placement and statistical errors in the fitting process ; upper limits are 3@xmath14 .",

    "we identify the feature centered at rest wavelength @xmath01088.46 as an intrinsically strong line ( oscillator strength @xmath16=1.84 , morton 2000 ) .",
    "since ge@xmath17 is located in the region , it should have the same velocity as other ionized species .",
    "swst  1 and ic  4593 show good agreement ( table 1 ) , while the lines appear at slightly more negative velocities in bd+30@xmath13639 and ngc  3132 .",
    "however , these discrepancies are probably not significant given the resolution of _",
    "fuse_.    since the ionization potentials ( ips ) of and are 15.9 ev and 34.2 ev respectively , we expect to contain a large fraction of the gas - phase ge in pne with relatively cool central stars , where comprises a significant fraction of o. ( in comparison , ip ( ) = 13.6 ev and ip ( ) = 35.1 ev . )",
    "swst 1 and bd+30@xmath13639 have cool ( @xmath18  35,000 k ) , late wolf - rayet ( [ wr ] ) type central stars and relatively high ( o@xmath19)/(o@xmath17 ) .",
    "ic  4593 also has a fairly cool central star ( kaler & jacoby 1991 ) . the central star of ngc  3132 is a visual binary consisting of an a2  v star plus a hotter , low - luminosity companion ( mndez 1978 ) .",
    "we set upper limits on @xmath20(ge@xmath21 ) based on non - detections of @xmath01229.84 ( @xmath16=0.25 ) in stis spectra of swst  1 ( de marco et al .",
    "2002 ) and bd+30@xmath13639 , and on @xmath20(ge@xmath22 ) from @xmath01237.06 ( @xmath16=1.23 ) for swst  1 and bd+30@xmath13639 , and @xmath01098.71(@xmath16=0.55 ) for ic  4593 and ngc  3132 .",

    "we therefore conclude that the observed features are primarily due to .",
    "we also searched the archival _ fuse _ spectra of 23 other pne , but found no other detections of .",
    "however , various factors could be responsible for this , such as a weak uv continuum , central star hot enough to ionize most of the ge beyond ge@xmath17 , or lack of sufficiently large column of ionized gas along the line of sight .",
    "many pne have asymmetrical structures , and because these measurements require a bright fuv continuum there is a selection bias in favor of nebulae for which the central star is seen along a low - extinction , low column - density sight line .",
    "the column densities listed in table  1 were computed from the measured w@xmath11 values , assuming that the lines are on the linear part of the curve of growth .",
    "in fact , some of the lines are marginally saturated .",
    "if the line widths were purely thermal ( @xmath12 = 1.5 km  s@xmath8 for ge , 2.3 km  s@xmath8 for s ) , the line center optical depths would be @xmath29  5",
    ". however , the fitted @xmath12 values are @xmath7 10 km  s@xmath8 , probably due to turbulence or shear motions , so that @xmath30 1 except for lines from the ground levels of the more abundant ions . in those cases we use lines from excited fine - structure levels , which are less saturated , to infer populations in the ground level .",
    "the quantity of most interest is the ge abundance with respect to an element which is unaffected by internal nucleosynthesis . whenever possible , we use s as the reference element since it is not depleted into dust ( savage & sembach 1996 ) , and assume that ( ge / s ) @xmath7 ( ge@xmath17)/(s@xmath22  +  s@xmath17 ) , as and together span a similar ionization range as ( 15.934.2 ev for ; 10.423.3 ev for and 23.334.8 ev for ) .",
    "we take ( ip range 16.230.7 ev ) as the reference species for ngc  3132 since we did not detect ( see below ) .",
    "whereas has a 4s@xmath31 ground configuration and therefore only one low - lying energy level , and possess several fine - structure levels which may contain significant populations .",
    "ideally one should measure absorption lines from each level , but this is not always feasible . for",
    ", lines from both excited levels could be measured in all but ngc  3132 .",
    "we used the web - based multi - level atom program of shaw & dufour ( 1995 ; http://stsdas.stsci.edu/nebular ) to predict the population ratios among the three fine - structure levels at the temperature and density of the ionized gas , and compared these with our derived column densities .",
    "if the measured population ratio of the excited levels agreed with the multi - level calculation , we use the latter to obtain the ground level population and total ionic column density .",
    "swst  1 is the only object for which and transitions from all three levels of the ground @xmath32p term of are observable .",
    "the lines from the excited levels , * @xmath01015.78 and * * @xmath01021.33 , are free of blending , but the corresponding transition from the ground level at @xmath01012.50 is potentially saturated and contaminated by several strong resonance ( @xmath33 = 0 ) h@xmath15 lines .",
    "the value derived from this line is about 40%  lower than the ground - level population inferred from the excited levels , which we attribute to saturation .",
    "we used @xmath01250.58 , a low-@xmath16 line in the stis band , to derive @xmath20 ( ) .",
    "for bd+30@xmath13639 , @xmath01012.50 is not observable due to strong h@xmath15 absorptions from the nebula and foreground ism , so @xmath20 ( ) in table  1 is from  @xmath01190.21 .",
    "however , since this line is saturated , we computed the ground - state population from the excited levels as described above , yielding a value about 2.6 times higher than measured .",
    "all of the lines are saturated , so we adopt /  =  0.79 from pwa et al .",
    "( 1986 ) to infer @xmath20 ( ) .",
    "we used a similar approach to determine ground state and total column densities for ic  4593 , and obtained @xmath20 ( ) by assuming the s ionic ratio from optical emission lines ( bohigas & olgun 1996 ) .",
    "since s is not detected in ngc  3132 , we were forced to use the less satisfactory species .",
    "the @xmath34d ground term of has several fine - structure levels , although the populations of the higher levels are likely to be small due to their low statistical weights .",
    "we marginally detect @xmath01124.88 , the strongest ( @xmath16=0.052 ) line from the first excited level , @xmath34d@xmath35 .",
    "the surprising strength of @xmath01130.40 from the @xmath34d@xmath36 level suggests that this line may be blended or incorrectly identified .",
    "however , not only is the ground - level @xmath01122.52 line saturated , it is also contaminated by and possibly by vibrationally - excited h@xmath15 . since these effects tend to offset each other and the measurements of the excited levels are uncertain , we did not apply a multi - level calculation . for these reasons as well as",
    "the uncertain depletion of gas - phase fe ( see  3.3 ) , our abundance estimate of ge in ngc  3132 is less certain than for the other pne .",
    "the degree to which each element is depleted out of the gas and into the solid ( dust ) phase is an important issue for interpreting our results .",
    "as mentioned above , s is not significantly depleted in the ism ( savage & sembach 1996 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "fe is depleted by varying amounts in different components of the ism : 1.25  dex in the warm ionized medium ( wim ) ; as much as 2.27  dex in cold , neutral material ( cnm ; savage et al .",
    "the ge depletion has been measured along only a handful of sight lines ; a value of 0.62  dex was determined by cardelli et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , and welty et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found similar values , with slightly less depletion in wim than in cnm gas .",
    "table  2 summarizes the ge abundances we derive for each pn relative to the indicated reference ions .",
    "the two listed values correspond to the depletion patterns of the cnm and wim , where we take the fe depletions cited above . for ge , we assume 0.62  dex for the cnm case , and no depletion for the wim , providing lower limits to the ge abundances .",
    "it seems probable that conditions in pne are most similar to those of the wim , or intermediate , but the values in table  2 cover the likely range of values .",
    "the derived ge abundances in these objects range from @xmath7 330 times solar , depending on the object and assumed depletion factors .",
    "we emphasize that the depletion of ge is particularly uncertain , and that our values might be underestimates .",
    "regardless , the qualitative result of this study is that ge significantly enriched in the observed pne .",
    "it is interesting that the two best detections of , in swst  1 and bd+30@xmath13639 , involve pne with [ wr ] central stars .",
    "the surface compositions of these stars have presumably been altered by their prior evolution , since they exhibit severe h deficiencies and c enrichments .",
    "while the detailed evolutionary path which produces a [ wr ] central star is not well understood , it is likely to involve late thermal pulses , deep mixing , and/or heavy mass loss ( iben et al . 1993 ; herwig 2001 ; blcker 2001 ) .",
    "therefore it is plausible that nucleosynthetic products such as _ s_-process nuclei may be enhanced to a greater degree in nebulae with [ wr ] central stars than in other pne .",
    "we report the discovery of  @xmath01088.46 in four pne observed with the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer_. this line , which arises in the ionized zone , is used to estimate the abundance of ge in the nebular gas relative to the elements s and fe , whose abundances are not altered by the star s evolution .",
    "we find convincing evidence for elevated abundances @xmath2310 times solar ( depending on assumed depletion factors ) and therefore self - enrichment of ge by _",
    "s_-process nucleosynthesis in the progenitor stars .",
    "this result demonstrates the potential of uv absorption - line spectroscopy to shed light on the operation of the _ s_-process in pn progenitor stars . by determining the abundances of various heavy elements in pne , one can set constraints on models of stellar nucleosynthesis and mixing in late stellar evolutionary stages , and directly investigate the process of chemical enrichment of the ism by stars that evolve through the agb and pn phases .",
    "we are grateful to the _ fuse _ operations and science teams , whose exceptional efforts have made this facility available to the astronomical community .",
    "we thank s. mccandliss for providing data on h@xmath15 , o. de marco for sharing her stis spectrum of swst  1 , and d. lambert and c. sneden for helpful comments .",
