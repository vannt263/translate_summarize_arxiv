    "in particular , the very recent observation of a zero - bias peak in the differential conductance through a semiconductor nanowire in contact with a superconducting electrode indicated the possible existence of a midgap majorana state@xcite .",
    "such a zero - bias peak was also observed in subsequent experiments@xcite .",
    "however , this zero - bias peak could be due to the kondo resonance@xcite and also occur in the presence of either disorders@xcite or a singlet - doublet quantum phase transition@xcite , corresponding to ordinary andreev bound states rather than mbss .",
    "moreover , a study of a more realistic model of a nanowire with mbss further indicates a different origin for this observed zero - bias peak@xcite .",
    "there are several recent works@xcite developed , for example , to distinguish between the majorana and kondo origins of the zero - bias conductance peak , but a definite evidence for the zero - bias anomaly due to mbss is still missing .",
    "therefore , further investigations are needed to convincingly reveal the existence of mbss .",
    "we will focus on the detection of mbss which exist in pairs at the two ends of a nanowire .",
    "most previous studies based on a variety of setups considered a detector coupled locally to an adjacent mbs at one end of the nanowire only@xcite , as the coupling to the other mbs farther away is neglected .",
    "for example , a quantum dot coupled to a mbs was studied in ref .",
    "the current and the shot noise through the quantum dot were calculated .",
    "a characteristic feature in the frequency dependence of the shot noise was proposed as a signature for the mbs .",
    "the coupling of a quantum dot to two mbss at both ends of a nanowire has also been studied@xcite , but only the conductance was reported . in this work ,",
    "we study both the local and nonlocal coupling of a single electron transistor ( set ) ( consisting of a quantum dot and two electrodes ) to two mbss at both ends of a nanowire .",
    "we calculate the full counting statistics ( fcs)@xcite of electron transport through the set .",
    "fcs yields all zero - frequency current correlations at once and provides detailed insights into the nature of charge transfer beyond what is available from conductance measurements alone@xcite .",
    "importantly , it has also become an experimentally accessible technique in recent years@xcite . using the fcs",
    ", we calculate the current , fano factor and skewness as functions of a tunnel rate ratio of the set .",
    "the calculations are performed for various couplings of the set island with the mbss .",
    "the results are also compared with those for coupling to a fermionic state instead .",
    "we will show in the following that in the absence of the mbss or when coupled to fermionic states , the fano factor and the skewness are minimized for a symmetric set .",
    "however , in the presence of the mbss , the minimum points shift appreciably to occur for an asymmetric set with a higher tunnel rate at the drain than at the source .",
    "we propose that these mbs - induced shifts of the minimum points of the fano factor and the skewness can be used as signatures for the identification of the mbss .",

    "have been suggested to exist at the two ends of a semiconductor nanowire with strong spin - orbit coupling@xcite .",
    "the set consists of a metallic island coupled via tunneling barriers to two electrodes .",
    "the energy levels and the tunneling barriers can be tuned by the gate voltages . by assuming a zeeman splitting much larger than the mbs - set coupling strength , the source - drain bias voltage across the set , and the tunneling rates with the source and drain electrodes , the set island can be modeled by a single resonant level occupied by a spin - polarized electron .    .",
    "the energy level of the set island is tuned to be zero , i.e. , in resonance with the mbss .",
    "also , the set island couples to the adjacent mbs with a coupling strength @xmath0 and the mbs at the other end of the nanowire with a coupling strength @xmath1.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the interaction between the mbss and the set island can be derived from a second quantization hamiltonian as ( see methods ) @xmath2 where the coupling coefficients @xmath3 and @xmath4 are assumed to be real and independent of @xmath5 for simplicity .",
    "this hamiltonian involves both the local coupling @xmath0 to an adjacent mbs at one end of the nanowire and the nonlocal coupling @xmath1 to the mbs at the other end of the nanowire ( see figure  1 ) . due to its smaller magnitude",
    ", the nonlocal coupling was neglected in most previous studies@xcite with an exception of ref .",
    "we note that this nonlocal coupling can give rise to further detector - position - dependent measurement results which may also be used for the identification of the mbss .",
    "the nonlocal coupling is therefore also considered here .",
    "the coupling between two separated mbss at the two ends of the nanowire can be described by@xcite @xmath6where @xmath7 is the coupling energy with @xmath8 being the wire length and @xmath9 the superconducting coherent length .",
    "the pair of mbss can constitute a regular fermion with operators @xmath10    in this regular - fermion representation , the hamiltonian @xmath11 of the hybrid mbs - set system becomes @xmath12where @xmath13 is the resonant - level energy of the set island and @xmath14 is the corresponding creation ( annihilation ) operator .",
    "note that this energy can be tuned by the gate voltage @xmath15 to be zero ( i.e. , @xmath16 ) to ensure resonant tunnelings between the set island and the zero - energy mbss .",
    "the basis states of the system of interest are given by @xmath17 with @xmath18 and @xmath19 being @xmath20 and @xmath21 i.e. , @xmath22 .",
    "to compare the transport behaviors of the set in the presence of the mbss with those of a regular fermionic bound state in the nanowire , we also consider the following system hamiltonian @xmath23which describes the set when coupled to a regular fermionic state .",
    "the hamiltonian for the source and the drain electrodes of the set is described by @xmath24where @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) is the annihilation operator for electrons in the source ( drain ) electrode .",
    "the tunneling hamiltonian between the set island and the two electrodes is @xmath27,\\]]where @xmath28 is the coupling strength between the set island and the source ( drain ) electrode .",
    "the counting operator @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) decreases ( increases ) the number of electrons that have tunneled into the drain electrode in order to keep track of the tunnelings of successive electrons .",
    "thus , the total hamiltonian of the system is given by @xmath31 .",
    "to study the fcs , it is essential to know the probability @xmath32 of @xmath33 electrons having been transported from the set island to the drain electrode during a period of time interval @xmath34 .",
    "it is related to the cumulant generating function @xmath35 defined by@xcite @xmath36 we will consider the time interval @xmath34 much longer than the time for an electron to tunnel through the set island ( i.e. , the zero - frequency limit ) , so that transient properties are insignificant . the derivatives of @xmath37 with respect to the counting field @xmath38 at @xmath39 yield the cumulant of order @xmath40 as @xmath41 these cumulants",
    "carry complete information of the fcs on the set island .",
    "for instance , the average current and the shot noise can be expressed as @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "thus , the fano factor @xmath44 is given by @xmath45 , which is used to characterize the bunching and anti - bunching phenomena in the transport process .",
    "the third - order cumulant @xmath46 gives rise to the skewness @xmath47 of the distribution of transported electrons . on the other hand ,",

    "we will calculate these reduced density matrix elements using a master equation ( see methods ) which assume a large bias voltage across the set .",
    "in fact , this large - bias case was considered in many previous studies@xcite as it is easy to implement in experiments . moreover , this makes the problem simpler and more transparent because the broadening effect of the set level can be neglected ( see , e.g. , refs .",

    "represents the absence of the mbss .",
    "our calculation shows that it also equivalently represents the case of coupling to a fermion in the nanowire .",
    "this is expected because a regular fermion state does not affect the counting statistics of a nearby set in the zero - frequency limit ( or stationary behaviors ) considered .",
    "it is clear from figure  2(a ) that for a symmetric set in which the tunneling rates between the set island and the two electrodes are the same , i.e. , @xmath78 , the current does not vary with @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( see also the analytical result below ) .",
    "however , when @xmath79 , the current in the presence of the mbss deviates appreciably from that in the absence of the mbss , especially in the region @xmath80 .",
    "moreover , figure  2(b ) shows that the current also changes , albeit slightly , when varying the coupling energy @xmath81 of the two mbss . from figures  2(a ) and 2(b ) , although coupling to the mbss does change the current quantitatively , a distinct qualitative feature is lacking .",
    "thus , it is insufficient to use only the current to show the existence of the mbss .",

    "in addition , instead of considering the fano factors ( or currents ) at both the source and drain electrodes as in ref .",
    "40 , we find it sufficient to characterize the mbss by studying the statistics only at the drain electrode .",

    "<S> we propose an approach for probing majorana bound states ( mbss ) in a nanowire via counting statistics of a nearby charge detector in the form of a single - electron transistor ( set ) . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the impacts on the counting statistics by both the local coupling between the detector and an adjacent mbs at one end of a nanowire and the nonlocal coupling to the mbs at the other end . we show that the fano factor and the skewness of the set current are minimized for a symmetric set configuration in the absence of the mbss or when coupled to a fermionic state . </S>",
    "<S> however , the minimum points of operation are shifted appreciably in the presence of the mbss to asymmetric set configurations with a higher tunnel rate at the drain than at the source . </S>",
    "<S> this feature persists even when varying the nonlocal coupling and the pairing energy between the two mbss . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that these mbs - induced shifts can be measured experimentally with available technologies and can serve as important signatures of the mbss . </S>"
