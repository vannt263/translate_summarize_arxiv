    "the notion of an @xmath0-algebra ( _ i.e. _  algebra over the sphere spectrum ) is well - known in homotopy theory ( _ cf . _  _ e.g. _  @xcite ) : in the categorical form used in this paper and implemented by the concept of a discrete @xmath1-ring , it was formalized in the late 90 s .",
    "@xmath0-algebras are also intimately related to the theory of brave new rings ( first introduced in the 80 s ) and of functors with smash products ( fsp ) for spectra in algebraic topology ( _ cf .",
    "_  @xcite ) .",
    "the goal of this article is to explain how the implementation of the notion of an @xmath0-algebra in arithmetic , in terms of segal s @xmath1-rings , succeeds to unify several constructions pursued in recent times aimed to define the notion of  absolute algebra \" . in particular",
    ", we refer to the development , for applications in number theory and algebraic geometry , of a suitable framework apt to provide a rigorous meaning to the process of taking the limit of geometry over finite fields @xmath2 as @xmath3 . in our previous work",
    "we have met and used at least three possible categories suitable to handle this unification : namely the category @xmath4 of monods as in @xcite , the category @xmath5 of hyperrings of @xcite and finally the category @xmath6 of semirings as in @xcite.in @xcite , n. durov developed a geometry over @xmath7 intended for arakelov theory applications by implementing monads as generalizations of classical rings . in his work",
    "certain combinatorial structures replace , at the archimedean place(s ) , the geometric constructions classically performed , at a finite prime ideal , in the process of reduction modulo that ideal . in the present article",
    "we argue that all the relevant constructions in _ op.cit . _  can be naturally subsumed by the well - known theory of @xmath0-algebras and segal s @xmath1-sets - space is needed in homotopy theory and",
    "is simply that of a simplicial @xmath1-set . ] in homotopy theory .",
    "this theory is taken up as the natural groundwork in the recent book @xcite . in proposition",
    "[ assembly ] we prove that the assembly map of @xcite provides a functorial way to associate an @xmath0-algebra to a monad on pointed sets . while in the context of @xcite the tensor product @xmath8 produces an uninteresting output isomorphic to @xmath9 , in proposition [ tensq ] we show that the same tensor square , re - understood in the theory of @xmath0-algebras , provides a highly non - trivial object . as explained in @xcite , the category of pointed @xmath1-sets is a symmetric closed monoidal category and the theory of generalized schemes of b. ten and m. vaqui in @xcite applies directly to this category while it could not be implemented in the category of endofunctors under composition of @xcite which is not symmetric .",
    "we endow the arakelov compactification @xmath10 of @xmath11 with a natural structure of a sheaf @xmath12 of @xmath0-algebras and each arakelov divisor provides a natural sheaf of modules over that structure sheaf .",
    "moreover , this new structure of @xmath10 over @xmath0 endorses a one parameter group of weakly invertible sheaves whose tensor product rule is the same as the composition rule of the frobenius correspondences over the arithmetic site @xcite .",
    "the fundamental advantage of having unified the various attempts done in recent times to provide a suitable definition of  absolute algebra \" by means of the well established concept of @xmath0-algebra is that this latter notion is at the root of the theory of topological cyclic homology which can be understood as cyclic homology over the absolute base @xmath0 .",
    "segal s @xmath1-spaces form a model for stable homotopy theory and they may be equivalently viewed as simplicial objects in the category of @xmath1-sets ( _ cf._@xcite ) .",
    "note that general @xmath1-spaces in _ op.cit .",
    "_  are not assumed to be special or very special , and it is only by dropping the very special condition that one can use the day product .",
    "moreover , the prolongation of a @xmath1-space to a spectrum is a purely formal construction and does not need the special / very special hypotheses .",
    "the very special condition only appears for  fibrant \" objects in the appropriate quillen model category .",
    "thus , the stable homotopy category , understood using general @xmath1-spaces , is properly viewed as the derived category of the algebraic category of @xmath1-sets , _ i.e. _  of @xmath0-modules .",
    "topological cyclic homology then appears as the direct analogue of ordinary cyclic homology of rings when one replaces the category of abelian groups by the category of @xmath1-sets . in particular",
    "it is now available to understand the new structure of @xmath10 using its structure sheaf @xmath12 and the modules .",
    "our original motivation for using cyclic homology in the arithmetic context arose from the following two results:@xmath13 in @xcite we showed that cyclic homology ( a fundamental tool in noncommutative geometry ) determines the correct infinite dimensional ( co)homological theory for arithmetic varieties to recast the archimedean local factors of serre as regularized determinants .",
    "the key operator in this context is the generator of the @xmath14-operations in cyclic theory.@xmath15 l. hesselholt and i. madsen have proven that the de rham - witt complex , an essential ingredient of crystalline cohomology , arises naturally when one studies the topological cyclic homology of smooth algebras over a perfect field of finite characteristic ( _ cf . _  _ e.g. _  @xcite ) .",
    "our long term objective is to use cyclic homology over the absolute base @xmath0 and the arithmetic site defined in @xcite to obtain a global interpretation of @xmath16-functions of arithmetic varieties .",

    "a @xmath1-set is the most embracing generalization of the datum provided on a set by a commutative addition with a zero element .",
    "the commutativity of the addition is encoded by the fact that the output of a ( finite ) sum depends only upon the corresponding finite set ( with multiplicity ) .",
    "a preliminary definition of a @xmath1-set is given by a covariant functor @xmath17 from the category @xmath18 of finite sets to the category @xmath19 of sets , mapping a finite set @xmath20 to the set @xmath21 of all possible strings of elements indexed by @xmath20 which can be added .",
    "the action of @xmath17 on morphisms encodes the addition , while its covariance embodies the associativity of the operation .",
    "one introduces a base point @xmath22 in the labelling of the sums and a base point @xmath23 to implement the presence of the @xmath24-element ( neutral for the sum ) .",
    "thus @xmath17 is best described by a pointed covariant functor from the category @xmath25 of finite pointed sets to the category @xmath26 of pointed sets .",
    "note that while the category of covariant functors @xmath27 is a topos the category of pointed covariant functors @xmath28 is no longer such and admits an initial object which is also final , in direct analogy with the category of abelian groups .",
    "the theory reviewed in chapter ii of @xcite is that of segal s @xmath1-spaces , _ i.e. _  of simplicial @xmath1-sets . the category of @xmath1-spaces admits a natural structure of model category ( _ cf.__op.cit . _",
    "definition 2.2.1.5 ) allowing one to do homotopical algebra .",
    "the transition from @xmath1-sets to @xmath1-spaces parallels the transition from abelian groups to chain complexes of abelian groups in positive degrees and the constructions of topological hochschild and cyclic homology then become parallel to the construction of their algebraic ancestors .",

    "the morphisms in the category are maps between pointed finite sets , preserving the base points .",
    "the notion of a discrete @xmath1-space , _ i.e. _  of a @xmath1-set suffices for our applications and at the same time it is intimately related to the topos @xmath33 of covariant functors @xmath34 .",
    "the small category @xmath35 is a pointed category _",
    "i.e. _  it admits a ( unique ) initial and final object , namely the object @xmath36 formed by the base point alone . in general , if @xmath37 is a pointed category one defines a @xmath1-object of @xmath37 to be a covariant functor @xmath38 preserving the base point .",
