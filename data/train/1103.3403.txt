    "similar ferromagnetic , ce - based compounds , such as cenisb@xmath0 or ceagsb@xmath3 were studied under pressure by resistivity measurements @xcite , and revealed complex phase diagrams , with ferromagnetic transitions evolving into antiferromagnetic ones under pressure . among the ce - based ferromagnets studied under pressure to date",
    ", none have exhibited superconducting behavior .",
    "the reported increase of @xmath1 for applied pressures up to 1  gpa @xcite motivated us to continue investigations on cevsb@xmath0 at higher pressures ; ultimately it is reasonable to expect @xmath1 to pass through a local maximum value and then decrease @xcite .",
    "ideally this would present a good opportunity to study possible quantum criticality in a ce - based ferromagnet .",
    "we present here resistivity and ac - calorimetry measurements under pressure up to 8 gpa , in a bridgman anvil cell modified to use a liquid medium and a diamond anvil cell , respectively .",
    "@xmath1 behaves as expected from the doniach model @xcite with an initial increase with pressure up to a maximum above which a fast decrease and ultimately disappearance of @xmath1 is observed .",
    "the low temperature power law fits of the resistivity are in agreement with the disappearance of the magnetic transition at a quantum critical point .",
    "we observed discrepancies in the @xmath1__(p ) _ _ behavior between pressure cells using different pressure media , and attributed it to the differences of pressure conditions , with a slight uniaxial component existing along the cell axis in the bridgman anvil cell .",
    "further measurements in the modified bridgman cell with a different , more hydrostatic , pressure medium , confirmed this assumption . with differently oriented samples",
    "we have studied the @xmath1__(p ) _ _ dependencies for different directions of the uniaxial component of pressure .",

    ", we measured several samples at ambient pressure with current flowing along each of the three crystallographic directions of the orthorhombic structure ( at least two samples for each direction ) .",
    "we observed a good reproducibility in the resistivity behavior , although the uncertainties associated with measuring the relatively small sample dimensions lead to an error in the resistivity value at room temperature of up to 30 - 40  % .",
    "each sample s orientation was identified from the crystal s morphology , as was discussed by sefat _",
    "@xcite without any further x - ray laue measurements .",
    "the reproducibility in resistivity from one sample to another was considered an indication that contributions from the other components of the resistivity were low or absent .",
    "in addition , thermal expansion was measured at ambient pressure using a capacitive dilatometer constructed of ofhc copper , mounted in a quantum design ppms instrument .",
    "a detailed description of the dilatometer is presented elsewhere @xcite .",

    "measurements were performed on warming .",
    "we define the thermal expansion coefficients as @xmath10 with @xmath11 being one of the 3 sample s principle crystallographic orientations , and the volume thermal expansion coefficient @xmath12 .",
    "resistivity measurements under pressure were performed using a bridgman cell modified to use with a liquid pressure medium @xcite , either a fluorinert mixture ( 1:1 fc70:fc77 ) or 1:1 n - pentane : isopentane . when not specified , the medium used was 1:1 fc70:fc77 .",
    "a piece of lead , to use as a manometer , and the sample were inserted in a pressure chamber of 1.4  mm inner diameter .",

    "although , ideally , we would like pressure to be hydrostatic ( i.e. isotropic ) , even with a medium that is a liquid at ambient conditions , once the media freezes at room temperature the application of pressure is expected to give rise to non - hydrostaticity that , as a first approximation , can be thought of as an application of hydrostatic pressure as well as a smaller uniaxial pressure .",
    "given our cell geometry , if such a uniaxial component exists , it is anticipated to be in the direction perpendicular to the thin - disk - like sample space volume , i.e. along the cell axis .",
    "if we align the sample with one of its crystallographic axes along this direction , then we will say that `` pressure is applied along this direction '' to identify this potential uniaxial direction .",
    "for example , we use in the following the notation @xmath13 to refer to the resistivity measured with current along the _ c_-axis and with pressure applied along the _ a_-axis of the sample .",
    "although the pressure is not purely hydrostatic , it is reproducible .",
    "three samples were measured with similar pressure conditions ( bridgman cell filled with fluorinert ) , current along the _ c _ axis and pressure applied along the _ a _ axis .",

    "1:1 n - pentane : isopentane offers pressure conditions much closer to hydrostaticity , compared to 1:1 fc70:fc77 in the bridgman cell pressure range , as it is known to freeze above 5  gpa at 300  k instead of below 1  gpa for the fluorinert mixture @xcite .",
    "however , it is more difficult to handle because of its high compressibility in the low pressure range @xcite ( below 2  gpa ) and because its boiling point is close to room temperature ( 28.5@xmath14c for isopentane ) . due to these difficulties ,",
    "one of the resistivity data sets , in 1:1 n - pentane : isopentane media , was taken in a three wire configuration after the failure of one of the wires . the resulting three wires resistivity measurement gave limited quantitative information , but a sharp transition was still observable , and its derivative , ( shown in figure [ derivative].a .",
    "below ) looks very similar to those obtained from four wires measurements , once the data for the first pressure are scaled to ambient pressure .",
    "the specific heat under pressure was measured in a diamond anvil cell @xcite up to pressures of 7  gpa cooled down to 1.5  k using a @xmath15he cryostat .",
    "the culet size of the anvils was 0.7  mm .",
    "the pressure , changed _ in - situ _ at low temperatures @xcite , was read using the ruby fluorescence method .",
    "argon was chosen as a pressure medium .",
    "albeit solidified at 1.4  gpa and 300  k , argon provides close to hydrostatic conditions due to its weak interatomic interactions ( i.e a very soft solid ) .",
    "three different pressure runs were performed . for one of these ,",
    "two pressure cycles were realized by decreasing pressure in one step after a first run with increasing pressure .",
    "the ac - calorimetry method @xcite was used ; a quasi - sinusoidal excitation was applied to the sample by a laser via a mechanical chopper .",
    "the temperature oscillations of the sample ( inversely proportional to the specific heat ) were measured with a au / aufe ( 0.07% ) thermocouple which was spot - welded on the sample .",

    "c__=6.0327  ) @xcite under pressure includes the study of the anisotropic properties of cevsb@xmath0 and in particular its sensitivity to slight uniaxial strains . in order to accomplish this , we first investigated the anisotropic resistivity with current _ i _ flowing along the three crystalline directions of this compound at ambient pressure ( figure [ anisot].a ) .",
    "the resistivity ratios between 300  k and 2  k range from 2 , when the current flows along the _",

    "the resistivity thus tends to be quasi two - dimensional , and in the following we study the resistivity along the _ b _ or _ c _ axis , depending on the geometry needed .",

    "the main interest of the present study is in the investigation of the evolution of @xmath1 under pressure .",
    "the modified bridgman cell used with fluorinert as a pressure medium is known to present a slight uniaxial component in addition to the expected isotropic pressure due in part to its low , room temperature freezing pressure , below 1  gpa . as an example , the iron arsenide superconductors , recently measured in this cell @xcite , are known to be sensitive to these uniaxial stresses which stabilize the superconducting phase . this superconducting phase is then observed in a broader pressure range of the phase diagram in presence of a uniaxial component of pressure . since cevsb@xmath0 is an orthorhombic compound with clear anisotropy and some degree of electronic correlation , we decided to check its sensitivity to uniaxial component of pressure associated with non - hydrostaticity .",
    "the grown crystals are relatively large and mechanically sturdy making them easy to polish to three different geometries to allow for this study .",
    "( this is in contrast to iron arsenides , which were soft and easily exfoliated along their tetragonal , _ c_-axis . )    the temperature dependent resistivity data of cevsb@xmath0 measured with the pressure successively applied along the three crystallographic directions are shown in figure [ resistivity ] .",
    "we had to measure the resistivity along two different directions so as to fully investigate the response of the crystal to slight uniaxial stresses , but the evolution of the anisotropy of resistivity under hydrostatic pressure was not the main purpose of this work .     under pressure .",

    "t(p ) _ curve extrapolates to zero , ranges from roughly 5.5 to 7  gpa . as this behavior is reproducible within 0.3  gpa for three different runs when the cell axis coincides with the _ a _ crystallographic axis , we assume the differences seen come from an anisotropic response to the slight uniaxial component present in the modified bridgman cell .",
    "this strong anisotropy and particular sensitivity to uniaxial component of pressure along the _ a _ crystallographic axis is confirmed when we use a more hydrostatic pressure medium .",
    "two runs in the modified bridgman cell with the same crystal orientation ( which appears to be the most sensitive to uniaxial pressure ) are shown figure [ pd].b , one with fluorinert and one with 1:1 n - pentane : isopentane as a pressure medium . here",
    "again we observe differences between the two runs in the maximum value of @xmath1 , its corresponding pressure , and the critical pressure .",
    "1:1 n - pentane : isopentane is known to freeze at room temperature above 5  gpa and fluorinert freezes below 1  gpa @xcite .",
    "this means that , contrary to the other medium , 1:1 n - pentane : isopentane was always liquid at room temperature in this experiment , and so was much closer to hydrostaticity .",
    "( a conclusion established by the superconducting transitions widths of the lead manometers , given in the experimental details section . ) the basic agreement between the 1:1 n - pentane : isopentane data and the @xmath35 data taken in argon ( discussed below ) and the higher pressure deviation of the fluorinert data from this manifold is further evidence that the discrepancies in the phase diagram can be attributed to an anisotropic sensitivity of the sample to a uniaxial component of pressure . keeping in mind the strong sensitivity of cevsb@xmath0 to pressure conditions , we try to be very cautious about the impact of pressure conditions to our results .",
    "to estimate the evolution of the samples sensitivity to pressure conditions , we checked the broadening of the magnetic transition .",
    "the lead , as a soft material , is not very sensitive to deviations to hydrostaticity and the broadening of the superconducting transition is modest @xcite .",
    "the transition broadening of cevsb@xmath0 would indeed be a more efficient clue as long as we are able to estimate also the effects intrinsic to the magnetism .",
    "we estimated in figure [ delta_tcurie ] the broadening of the transition by comparing two different criteria for @xmath1 : the maximum of the peak in the @xmath36 derivative and the onset of this peak from two asymptotes ( as shown by dashed lines in the inset ) . by comparing cells measured in different pressure conditions ,",
    "we get a good sense of pressure effect versus intrinsic properties of the compound .",
    "as @xmath36 appears to be very similar to the heat capacity feature around the transition , similar criteria were applied to @xmath37 data .        at ambient pressure ,",
    "the difference between both criteria is around 200  mk in resistivity and it increases only slightly up to around 400  mk at 3  gpa . above 3 or 4  gpa ,",
    "the transition broadens strongly , to above 4  k in the modified bridgman cell filled with fluorinert .",
    "the broadening observed with the 1:1 n - pentane : isopentane set of measurements is at least a factor of two smaller , compared to fluorinert , with only a slight increase at the highest pressure .",
    "we did not reach pressures above 4.5  gpa , because of the low compressibility of this medium and a pressure medium leak observed at the lowest pressure . whereas the effect of non - hydrostatic conditions on the transition broadening is obvious , some degree of broadening may be an intrinsic property of the material once @xmath1 starts to decrease at high pressures , as it generally seems to occur at pressures above the maximum of the magnetic transition temperature .    to further our investigation of the influence of pressure non - hydrostaticity , a noble - gas as a pressure medium was used to provide a near hydrostatic reference .",
    "even when it is solid , its low interatomic interactions indeed allow excellent pressure conditions , as can be seen in figure [ delta_tcurie ] .",
    "this experiment entailed the measurement of specific heat in a diamond anvil cell with argon as a pressure medium , and is described below .      in figure [ cp ] , we present the temperature dependent specific heat curves of cevsb@xmath0 obtained from one of the three pressure runs .",
    "( in arbitrary units ) under pressure , measured in the diamond anvil cell .",
    "pressures are given in gpa.,width=340 ]    the transition at the lowest pressures is sharp with a shape similar to the ambient pressure measurement @xcite .",
    "the 1.0  gpa @xmath1 value inferred from the data presented in figure [ cp ] is in good agreement with that inferred from the magnetization data at 1.0  gpa @xcite . @xmath1",
    "progressively increases with pressure until 4.3 gpa and then decreases .",
    "the transition progressively broadens , and its amplitude also seems to decrease , although the background and the signal amplitude might be a little different from one measurement to another . whereas at pressures of 6.0 and 6.3  gpa , a feature is still clearly seen , we can just barely resolve a broad bump in the 6.9  gpa data .",
    "we can see in figure [ delta_tcurie ] the stronger broadening of the transition when @xmath1 decreases , similarly to what is found in the bridgman cell resistivity data",
    ". however , as the pressure conditions are closer to hydrostaticity compared to a bridgman cell filled with fluorinert , the transition is twice as sharp , in particular at the highest pressures as seen in figure [ delta_tcurie ] .",
    "the agreement is much better when the pressure medium is 1:1 n - pentane : isopentane with sharp transitions in both cases , in the overlapping pressure range .",
    "the @xmath1__(p ) _ _ values obtained are also shown in the phase diagrams in figure [ pd ] .",
    "the diamond anvil cell can be considered as the reference since the pressure conditions are presumed to be the closest to hydrostaticity .",
    "we observe an increase of @xmath1 from 4.6  k to as high as 9.7  k when the pressure increases from 0  gpa to 4.3  gpa .",
    "it then decreases and we expect to have a critical pressure around 7 - 7.5  gpa . from one run to another ,",
    "only differences in maximum @xmath1 are noticed , and they are below 1  k. these differences may also be linked to pressure conditions .",
    "light and medium gray triangles in figure [ pd ] respectively refer to the first and the second pressure increase realized with the same diamond anvil cell in specific heat .",
    "we observe a slightly lower maximum @xmath1 , around 0.5  k , for the second run , when the sample may be more strained .",
    "these differences between runs even with a noble gas as a pressure medium emphasize here again the extreme sensitivity of cevsb@xmath0 to pressure conditions .",

    "we do not observe any deviations between the @xmath1__(p ) _ _ curves below 3  gpa .",
    "this might be due to relatively good hydrostaticity in this pressure range .",
    "it is interesting to notice that whereas deviations in hydrostaticity tend to modify the pressure dependence of @xmath1 , the low temperature functional dependence of the resistivity appears to be similar at comparable distances from the critical point . indeed",

    "the fact that both the _ a _ and _ n _ data fall onto common manifolds indicates that the quantum critical behavior is inherent to the system and only depends upon the distance from the critical value of the tuning parameter , pressure in this case .",
    "this result implies that slight uniaxial components of pressure may be utilized to further tune the criticality without fundamentally changing the underlying physics .      when pressure is applied , the magnetic ordering temperature first increases , passing through a maximum before decreasing at a faster rate .",
    "no magnetic transition is observed for pressures above 7  gpa .",
    "this behavior is consistent with what we expect from the competition between the kondo effect and the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida interaction .",
    "the phase diagram ( figure [ pd ] ) has a shape in very good agreement with the doniach model @xcite .",
    "a goal of this study was to determine the presence of a possible quantum critical point .",
    "although the suppression of @xmath1 seems continuous , we can not clearly follow the transition for @xmath64 1.5  k. even between 1.5  k and at least 4  k , in the modified bridgman cell as well as in the diamond anvils cell , the peak used to infer the transition temperature is broad and its amplitude is small . this broader transition and lower amplitude may be an additional evidence of the progressive weakening of the magnetic transition once the pressure is high enough to reduce @xmath1 , even in good pressure conditions .",
    "it has also to be mentioned that the transition broadening is in part related to the fact that above @xmath56 4  gpa , @xmath1__(p ) _ _ line is becoming steeper with pressure .",
    "the @xmath65@xmath1 resulting from fixed experimental uncertainties will consequently increase . in the present case then , it is useful to evaluate the pressure evolution of the fit parameters @xmath66 obtained at very low temperature to find further evidences for a quantum critical point .",
    "as we already showed , it was found to be acceptable to fit only down to 1.8  k ( @xmath39he cryostat temperatures ) at least to get a qualitative behavior .",
    "the results from the low temperature fits @xmath66 presented in figure [ ltfit ] are consistent with a presence of pressure induced quantum critical point .",
    "a sharp peak is observed in the _",
    "a(p ) _ graph and the _",
    "n(p ) _ graph drops sharply to @xmath671 as the critical pressure is approached . at low pressures , the _",
    "n _ exponent is above 2 as expected in the magnetic phase for a kondo lattice system , and it tends to increase with the magnetic transition temperature .",
    "it then decreases until the critical pressure . at that point ,",
    "_ n _ is around 1.35 - 1.4 , when measured in a @xmath68he cryostat .",
    "this value is very close to 4/3 , given by the spin fluctuation model in the case of a two - dimensional ferromagnet .",
    "however the lowest temperature obtained to determine _",
    "n _ was 0.35  k , which might be too high when close to the critical pressure . _",
    "n _ is then probably a little underestimated ( from our estimations , _",
    "n _ tends to increase when the temperature decreases in this pressure range ) .",
    "the _ a _ and @xmath69 parameters appear to be less sensitive to the fit temperature range .",
    "@xmath70 slightly increases while approaching @xmath71 , and then present a stronger decrease . however , its behavior is much different when pressure is applied along the _ c_-axis and current along the _",
    "b_-axis , probably because of the resistivity anisotropy .",
    "it is interesting to notice that at higher pressures , far enough from the critical pressure , @xmath70 is even lower than at ambient pressure .",
    "no superconductivity was observed in this compound down to the lowest temperature of 0.35  k reached in this work .",
    "this may be due to the ferromagnetic order , as no superconductivity was found in any other ce - based ferromagnetic compounds such as cenisb@xmath0@xcite or ceagsb@xmath3@xcite , presenting many similarities .",
    "antiferromagnetic order is indeed known to be more propitious to superconductivity , compared to a ferromagnetism @xcite , and it has been shown that _",
    "d_-wave singlet pairing in nearly antiferromagnetic metals is generally much stronger than _ p_-wave triplet pairing in nearly ferromagnetic metals @xcite . on another hand ,",
    "at least four u - based ferromagnetic compounds , which are all ising - type ferromagnets , were found to be superconductors , at ambient pressure for urhge @xcite and ucoge @xcite , or under pressure for uge@xmath3 @xcite and uir @xcite .",
    "the residual resistivity ratio of cevsb@xmath0 is low ( below 10 over the whole pressure range ) with a rather high residual resistivity , above 10 @xmath27 cm , compared to other superconducting ce compounds .",
    "this may evidence a too strong scattering for the occurrence of exotic superconductivity . as an example , the residual resistivity should not be higher than a few @xmath27 cm in the case of cepd@xmath3si@xmath3 and cein@xmath0 to observe superconductivity @xcite . on the other hand , for the ferromagnet ceagsb@xmath3 , no superconductivity was observed in high quality samples with @xmath55 below 0.5  @xmath27 cm @xcite . finally , the lowest temperatures reached of 0.35  k might also be too high to observe any eventual superconductivity .",
    "we determined the pressure - temperature phase diagram of the ferromagnetic compound cevsb@xmath0 .",
    "an initial increase of @xmath1 with pressure up to 4.5  gpa ( for hydrostatic pressure medium ) is observed , followed by the transition being progressively suppressed with further increase of pressure , in agreement with the doniach model . from the extrapolation of @xmath1 to zero and the low temperature fits of the resistivity , we find a quantum critical point around 7  gpa .",
    "no superconductivity was observed down to 0.35  k. we took advantage of the uniaxial component in the modified bridgman anvils cell and applied successively the pressure along the three axis .",
