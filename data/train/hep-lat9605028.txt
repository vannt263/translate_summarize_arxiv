    "lattice simulations of high temperature qcd provide , at present , our only firmly grounded theoretical insights into the phenomenology of the transition from hadronic matter to the quark - gluon plasma , and into the nature of the plasma itself . our ultimate goals in lattice simulations at high temperature include ( 1 ) establishing continuum scaling , important not only for determining the temperature of the crossover , but necessary for the validity of all dynamical fermion simulations , ( 2 ) establishing the mechanism for the dissolution / formation of hadrons at the crossover , ( 3 ) exploring the intricate critical behavior associated with the phase transition , and ( 4 ) obtaining a quantitative characterization of the quark - gluon plasma , including the equation of state . to achieve these goals",
    "requires a combination of advances in algorithms and computing power @xcite .",
    "recent improvements in quenched lattice algorithms hold promise for dynamical fermion simulations @xcite . here",
    "we present results of simulations with the conventional staggered fermion action at the smallest lattice spacing to date .",
    "the most detailed previous simulations with two - flavors of staggered fermions were carried out at @xmath0 ( @xmath1 fm)@xcite , @xmath2 ( @xmath3 fm ) and @xcite @xmath4 ( @xmath5 fm ) @xcite .",
    "results of those simulations reaffirmed the hypothesis that for two flavors there is a rapid crossover , but no phase transition at nonzero quark mass .",
    "moreover , the ratio @xmath6 was found to be consistent with previous measurements . despite the lack of surprises at @xmath2 and 8",
    ", there are strong reasons to push to still smaller lattice spacing .",
    "the full flavor symmetry in the staggered fermion scheme is restored only in the continuum limit .",
    "sigma models of chiral symmetry restoration suggest that the crossover becomes a first order phase transition as the number of flavors is increased @xcite .",
    "if flavor symmetry breaking were to cause an effective undercounting of quark flavors , one might expect a more pronounced crossover , or even a genuine phase transition at smaller lattice spacing .",
    "moreover , strong coupling distortions in the hadron spectrum at @xmath2 undermine credibility in a determination of the crossover temperature or even in the plausibility of having achieved a scaling ratio @xmath6 . for these reasons we undertook a simulation at @xmath7 fm .",
    "preliminary results were reported at the bielefeld and melbourne lattice conferences @xcite .",
    "the simulation with two flavors was carried out using the r algorithm described in @xcite at two quark masses , @xmath8 and 0.016 and six couplings , @xmath9 , 5.70 , 5.725 , 5.75 , 5.80 , 5.85 , except that the 5.725 coupling was not simulated at the higher mass . in each case",
    "the simulation was extended to at least 2000 molecular dynamics time units .",
    "lattices were saved at intervals of 8 time units . for the present analysis",
    "the first 500 time units were omitted for equilibration .",
    "most of the results reported here are based on an analysis of the approximately 180 remaining lattices at each parameter pair .",
    "for the sake of comparison , we also present some new results for @xmath2 , based on a compilation of lattices from our equation of state study @xcite .",
    "in addition to the standard variables , the chiral order parameter and the polyakov loop , we introduce a fuzzy polyakov loop in an effort to regulate the ultraviolet divergence that becomes increasingly troublesome at small lattice spacing .",
    "we also measure the baryon susceptibility , the induced quark number , and the disconnected chiral susceptibility .",
    "results are presented in sec .  2 .",
    "we show that with our choice of masses and couplings , the crossover is more clearly defined in terms of the baryon susceptibility and induced quark number . in sec .",
    "3 we present a scaling analysis of the polyakov loop variable for world data ranging from @xmath0 to @xmath10 , in terms of a constituent quark free energy .",
    "we also present a critical scaling analysis of the dependence of @xmath11 on temperature and quark mass ( magnetic equation of state ) , including a compilation of world data for this variable .",
    "this analysis is carried out in the context of mean field as well as @xmath12 critical behavior .",
    "the high temperature crossover is conventionally located from the inflection point in a plot of the polyakov loop or chiral order parameter as a function of coupling .",
    "figures [ fig : pbpvsbeta ] and [ fig : repvsbeta ] plot these quantities at fixed bare quark mass as a function of coupling .",
    "it is clear that despite the small errors , at these quark masses the effect of the the crossover on these quantities is subtle , indeed .",
    "the polyakov loop measures the change @xmath13 in the ensemble free energy caused by the introduction of a static test quark . in particular , with our normalization @xmath14\\ ] ] as the lattice spacing shrinks , the test quark self - energy develops an ultraviolet divergence , which may overwhelm a crossover signal in this quantity .",
    "thus one might hope that by increasing the radius of the test charge , one might regulate the divergence and recover a signal at least as strong as was seen on a coarser lattice .",
    "accordingly , we constructed a `` fuzzy polyakov loop '' variable in analogy with techniques introduced for glueball sources @xcite .",
    "to do so , we replaced the conventional product of forward links @xmath15 with @xmath16 where @xmath17 the six staples associated with the link @xmath18 are the usual three - link products of the form @xmath19 centered on the link from @xmath20 to @xmath21 .",
    "a weighting @xmath22 was determined from a rough optimization of the variance . by construction",
    "the weights sum to 1 and we do not project the matrix @xmath23 onto su(3 ) , so this observable still creates a source of precisely one color triplet .",
    "figure [ fig : refvsbeta ] gives the result .",
    "comparing with the standard polyakov loop in fig .",
    "[ fig : repvsbeta ] , we see that smearing indeed reduces the relative statistical error , but apparently does not enhance the crossover signal .",
    "the conventional feynman path integral simulates the grand canonical ensemble in baryon number at zero chemical potential .",
    "the baryon susceptibility measures fluctuations in the baryon number of the ensemble .",
    "it is defined as the derivative of the baryon charge density with respect to chemical potential .",
    "the susceptibility can be defined separately for each flavor .",
    "thus with two quark flavors , two susceptibilities can be measured : a flavor singlet and flavor nonsinglet @xcite .",
    "both quantities are obtained at zero chemical potential . @xmath24",
    "the nonsinglet susceptibility is compared with results for lower @xmath25 @xcite in fig .  [",
    "fig : xnsvsbeta ] . also indicated is the free lattice quark value for each @xmath25 .",
    "a common feature is the abrupt rise in susceptibility at crossover , followed by an asymptotic approach to the free lattice quark value . at lower values of @xmath25 , where the crossover has been located with traditional methods ,",
    "we find that the baryon susceptibility reaches 1/31/2 of the free quark asymptotic value at the crossover .",
    "since this observable is based on a conserved charge , it is not renormalized , and offers our most distinctive signal for the crossover .",
    "following the same rule for @xmath10 places the crossover in the @xmath8 series between @xmath9 and 5.70 and in the @xmath26 series between @xmath27 and 5.80 .    to convert these results to a temperature , we use a scale in which the rho meson mass is taken to be 770 mev , regardless of quark mass .",
    "the rho mass in lattice units is obtained in turn from an empirical fit to masses in a compilation of two - flavor staggered fermion spectral simulations @xcite , and includes an extrapolation beyond the parameter range of spectral measurements ( @xmath28 ) using tadpole - improved asymptotic scaling .",
    "details are given in the appendix .",
    "from the baryon susceptibility we then place the crossover at @xmath29 mev@xmath30 at the lighter quark mass and @xmath31 mev@xmath30 at the heavier quark mass .",
    "another confinement - sensitive observable is the induced quark number @xcite .",
    "this observable measures the total residual light - quark number in an ensemble containing a single test quark . @xmath32",
    "the induced quark number density @xmath33 is measured in the presence of the test quark .",
    "operationally , the quantity measures the correlation between the polyakov loop and the light - quark density @xcite .",
    "this observable is subject to considerable fluctuation .",
    "we found it particularly effective to introduce the test charge through the fuzzy polyakov loop variable described above .",
    "the baryon density of the dynamical quark is computed using a random source estimator @xcite . to improve the signal further , we adjusted the number of random sources using an adaptive procedure on a configuration - by - configuration basis as follows : starting with a minimum of 20 random sources the variance of the total induced baryon number was estimated .",
    "if the variance was greater than tolerance , another 20 random sources were added to the sample , and so on , up to a maximum of 80 for one configuration .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qvst ] and compared with results from simulations at lower @xmath25 .",
    "the induced quark number is expected to be exactly @xmath34 at zero temperature , since confinement requires screening of the test charge by a single antiquark . at the crossover , this quantity rises rapidly , approaching zero in the high temperature phase . at lower @xmath25",
    "the induced quark number reaches approximately @xmath35 at crossover .",
    "thus the induced quark number density can give an operational definition of the crossover .",
    "applying this rule to the @xmath10 data gives @xmath36 ( @xmath37 mev@xmath30 ) in the @xmath8 series and @xmath38 ( @xmath39 mev@xmath30 ) in the @xmath26 series .",
    "this crossover location is consistent with , but somewhat less precise than , that found from the baryon susceptibility .",
    "another signal for the crossover is the singlet chiral susceptibility @xmath40 which measures fluctuations in the chiral order parameter @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "here we differentiate with respect to equated up and down quark masses .",
    "since the derivative is the space - time integral of the correlator @xmath41 , a peak in this observable occurs at a minimum in the @xmath42 meson screening mass , indicating the presence of a soft mode .",
    "such soft modes are expected in models of critical behavior @xcite . like the @xmath42 meson propagator",
    ", the singlet chiral susceptibility can be decomposed into two contributions : quark - line - connected and quark - line - disconnected : @xmath43 the connected susceptibility in another guise is the derivative of @xmath11 with respect to valence quark mass at fixed sea quark mass and @xmath44 @xcite , while the disconnected susceptibility is the configuration variance of @xmath11 : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the expectation value computed on a single gauge configuration and @xmath47 denotes averaging over all gauge configurations in the sample .",
    "we used the standard gaussian random source estimator for @xmath46 , @xmath48 one must take care in using this estimator for eq .",
    "( [ eq : xsdisc ] ) , since the square involves correlated quartic terms in the random source variable . averaging then reintroduces part of the connected susceptibility along with the disconnected susceptibility .",
    "we chose to avoid the problem altogether by computing the estimator from five separate random sources on each configuration and forming products in eq .",
    "( [ eq : xsdisc ] ) only from pairs of estimators with different random sources .",
    "( for the smaller volume @xmath2 data we used 33 random sources per configuration . )",
    "results for @xmath49 and @xmath50 are compared in figs .",
    "[ fig : xsdiscvst ] and [ fig : xsconnvst ] with the results of karsch and laermann at @xmath0 @xcite and results from a reanalysis of a set of @xmath2 lattices retained from an equation of state study@xcite .",
    "the benefits of the larger sample in the @xmath0 data are clearly evident in this variable . at the lighter quark mass ( @xmath51 )",
    "the @xmath0 octagons define a crossover peak at about 145 mev@xmath30 .",
    "this peak can be sought in the @xmath2 data at a comparable quark mass ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the data are crude but not inconsistent with a comparable peak . the bursts plot @xmath10 data at the lighter quark mass ( @xmath53 ) , which are not inconsistent with a peak in the range 140 - 160 mev@xmath30 .",
    "the signal in the higher mass @xmath10 data ( diamonds ) is inconclusive .    that the signal in @xmath49 should be weaker at higher quark mass",
    "is expected from models of critical behavior that place the critical point at zero quark mass .",
    "the mass ratio @xmath54 measures proximity to the critical point . in the @xmath0 data ,",
    "this ratio is less than 0.1 for the lighter quark mass ( @xmath55 ) data and between 0.1 and 0.2 for the @xmath56 data . for the @xmath2 data it is also between 0.1 and 0.2 . for the @xmath10 data , it is between 0.2 and 0.3 for @xmath8 and 0.3 to 0.4 for @xmath26 .",
    "thus we expect a weakening of the crossover signal at the quark masses treated in our higher @xmath25 data .    the connected part of the susceptibility @xmath50 is compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : xsconnvst ] with results from @xmath0 and our results from @xmath2 .",
    "this quantity is far less noisy than the disconnected contribution .",
    "the lack of a discernible peak in the @xmath57 results is presumably another consequence of the greater distance from the critical point .      to summarize , the observables we have considered place the crossover at @xmath10 in the range @xmath36 at @xmath8 and in the range @xmath58 at @xmath26 , which we translate to @xmath59 mev@xmath30 and @xmath60 mev@xmath30 , respectively . this determination is compared with results for a wide variety of two - flavor simulations with both wilson and staggered fermions in fig  [ fig : tcovermrhopi2sq ] @xcite .",
    "here we plot the temperature in units of the @xmath61 meson mass _ vs _ the square of the ratio of the @xmath62 to @xmath61 mass .",
    "for the staggered fermion simulations , we use the lightest local ( non - goldstone ) pion .",
    "this state is expected to be degenerate with the goldstone pion in the continuum limit , so progress toward the origin in this ratio measures restoration of flavor as well as chiral symmetry . except for a few @xmath0 points from wilson fermions ,",
    "the consistency of these results ( within about ten percent ) is quite striking .",
    "the wide range of @xmath25 values now available makes possible an amusing analysis of the polyakov loop variable , which measures the change in the free energy of the thermal ensemble due to the introduction of a point spinless test quark .",
    "this free energy difference , @xmath63 a function of the temperature @xmath64 and light quark mass @xmath65 , includes the lattice - regulated ultraviolet - divergent self - energy of the point source , proportional to the inverse lattice spacing @xmath66 , and the free energy of the screening cloud of light antiquarks , quarks , and gluons , which we might call the `` constituent quark free energy '' . computing the self energy to leading order in perturbation theory , we have @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the color casimir factor for the triplet representation , @xmath69 is the color fine structure constant appropriate for heavy quark bound states at the same lattice scale , and @xmath70 is the dimensionless static lattice propagator for a debye - screened electrostatic gluon field evaluated at zero separation .",
    "screening provides an arbitrary infrared cutoff . although the ultraviolet divergent contribution @xmath66 is uniquely determined in the limit @xmath71 , an infrared cutoff , here embodied in the debye mass @xmath72 , determines where the contribution from the point quark ends and the contribution from the screening cloud begins .",
    "thus this approach offers no unique definition of a `` constituent quark free energy '' . instead , within the framework of any consistent definition , eq .",
    "( [ eq : cqfreeen ] ) permits a separation of two contributions , one varying in a known way with the lattice scale @xmath66 and the other , unknown , but scale - invariant ( at least in the continuum limit ) .",
    "herein lies its predictive power : no matter what choice is made for the infrared cutoff , a measurement of @xmath73 at two different values of @xmath25 can be used to predict @xmath73 at any other @xmath25 .    for present purposes , using @xmath74 , we choose a simpler approximate form @xmath75 and adjust the dimensionless constant @xmath76 by eye to achieve the rough scaling agreement shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cqfen ] . for each data set only values for the lightest available quark mass are used .",
    "although the quark mass values @xmath77 are not the same from one @xmath25 to the next in this figure , they are small ( @xmath78 ) and the small variation would be expected to make little difference ( of the order 10 mev ) in the free energy . the best value for @xmath76 appears to be about 0.4 , compared with values ranging from 0.26 to 0.35 expected from the lowest order perturbative self energy with a screening mass @xmath79 .",
    "it is curious that at the crossover , the free energy drops by about the 300 mev expected in a constituent quark model with deconfinement at high temperature .",
    "an su(n)@xmath80su(n ) sigma model has often been proposed as the paradigm for the high temperature phase transition in qcd @xcite . for two light flavors ( @xmath81 ) one appealing alternative , consistent with numerical results , is that chiral symmetry restoration proceeds through a second order phase transition at zero quark mass with attendant o(4 ) critical behavior .",
    "flavor symmetry breaking in the staggered fermion scheme preserves only an exact o(2 ) subgroup , so one may expect o(2 ) critical behavior on coarse lattices . away from the critical point , where fluctuations are unimportant",
    ", spin systems often exhibit mean field behavior .",
    "koic and kogut have even proposed that mean field behavior could extend up to the critical point , as a consequence of the composite nature of the scalar sigma model fields as they appear in qcd@xcite . while it remains to be established whether their arguments apply to qcd , we consider the mean field alternative a plausible first approximation , since we do not know the extent of the ginzburg scaling region . thus even if o(4 ) critical behavior is ultimately found in qcd at sufficiently large volume , it is possible that results imitate mean field behavior for lattices of the size considered in this study and at temperatures and quark masses that are not sufficiently close to the critical point .",
    "karsch @xcite and karsch and laermann @xcite have analyzed the crossover , starting from the fisher scaling hypothesis for the scaling of the critical contribution to the free energy @xmath82 from this scaling behavior one derives a scaling relation for the critical contribution to the magnetization @xmath83 : @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 is a scaling function . in qcd the quark mass plays the role of the magnetic field and @xmath11 , the magnetization .",
    "specifically , karsch suggests using @xmath87 = @xmath88 and @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the critical gauge coupling at zero quark mass for a particular @xmath25@xcite .",
    "this identification leads to a successful accounting for the crossover location ( `` pseudocritical point '' ) @xmath91 for @xmath92 at small quark mass .",
    "we extend the karsch and laermann analysis to a wider range of lattice spacings and test the scaling relation ( [ eq : eos ] ) directly . to anticipate the need to explore critical behavior ,",
    "while simultaneously approaching the continuum limit , we propose an identification that avoids quantities with anomalous dimensions , but entails a translation to physical units : @xmath93/t_c(0 ) \\\\",

    "the extra factor @xmath95 is needed to compensate for the quark mass factor @xmath65 .",
    "let us apply this analysis to data for @xmath11 from several groups @xcite .",
    "we begin by applying the following cuts to the world data :    * @xmath96 * @xmath97 * @xmath98 * @xmath99    the first cut keeps parameters within range of the spectrum interpolation .",
    "the last three are an attempt to keep values within the region dominated by the scaling part of the free energy . since we have no a priori knowledge of the extent of this region , these choices are arbitrary . indeed",
    "the cut on @xmath87 is probably too generous , as we shall see , but we have set it high initially so that all of the @xmath10 data are included .",
    "we first carry out a mean field analysis of the data .",
    "the mean field magnetic equation of state @xmath86 is determined from the global minimum of the usual quartic free energy @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are adjustable scale parameters .",
    "the third adjustable parameter is the critical temperature @xmath103 at zero quark mass , which we vary in 10 mev increments .",
    "our exploratory strategy is to seek the best agreement between world data ( after the cuts listed above ) and the resulting magnetic equation of state @xmath86 , giving higher priority to data with higher @xmath25 .",
    "setting the critical exponents to their mean field values , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , and adjusting @xmath103 to get the best qualitative agreement according to these preferences , we get the result shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : pbpmf140 ] with the choice @xmath106 . since the @xmath92 data appear to be outliers , it was necessary to omit them from the fit to the mean field magnetic equation of state .",
    "apart from the @xmath57 data at higher quark mass , the agreement is surprisingly good .",
    "our higher mass @xmath10 data are strikingly inconsistent with scaling .",
    "indeed , as we have remarked in our analysis of the disconnected susceptibility , the @xmath26 data are taken at values of @xmath87 higher than those of the rest of the sample included in the graph .",
    "thus it is plausible that these data are taken too far from the critical region .",
    "an alternative strategy , the one used in @xcite , is to emphasize agreement among world data for the full range of @xmath25 without regard to the mean field magnetic equation of state .",
    "our best result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbpmf150 ] with the choice @xmath107 .",
    "the mean field curve , based on fitting only over the range @xmath108 clearly does not match the data as well as it did with @xmath106 .    the corresponding exercise with o(4 ) critical exponents @xmath109 and @xmath110 is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : pbpo4130 ] and [ fig : pbpo4140 ] . in this case",
    "the magnetic equation of state is not known in closed form .",
    "instead , it was obtained from a simulation of an o(4 ) spin model @xcite , using critical exponents and the critical coupling reported by kanaya and kaya @xcite .",
    "the level of agreement is comparable to that of the mean field analysis .    at the present level of precision",
    "it is not possible to distinguish o(4 ) from mean field critical behavior , let alone from o(2 ) ( not shown ) .",
    "obviously a host of systematic errors , including finite volume effects and deviations from continuum scaling enter the analysis , so refinements are certainly needed before the method can serve as a definitive test of critical behavior .",
    "we presented results of a numerical simulation of qcd with conventional staggered fermions at nonzero temperature at the smallest lattice spacing attempted to date  approximately 0.1 fm .",
    "numerical results are collected in tables [ tab : nt12m008a][tab : nt12m016b ] .",
    "most of our data is obtained in simulations at @xmath10 , but some new results are also presented for @xmath2 . locating the high temperature crossover at 0.1 fm for @xmath111 is difficult in the conventional observables @xmath112 and @xmath11 . however ,",

    "our results at higher quark mass @xmath113 are farther from the critical point than the world data at smaller @xmath25 .",
