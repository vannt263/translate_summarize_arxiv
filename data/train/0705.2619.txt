    "in a purely hydrodynamical treatment , shock fronts are regarded as mathematical discontinuities , across which the density , pressure and temperature of the fluid vary according to the rankine - hugoniot jump conditions . a characteristic length scale for the thickness of the discontinuity appears when one takes into account the atomic structure of the gas ( zeldovich & raizer 1966 ) .",
    "the structure of collisional shock fronts is relatively well understood .",
    "a dissipation mechanism is generally required : for example , thermal conduction and viscosity for weak and strong shocks , respectively . in _",
    "collisionless _ shock fronts , the dissipation is due to turbulent electromagnetic fields rather than collisions . determining the structure of collisionless shocks requires an understanding of how particles equilibrate their temperatures via plasma instabilities , which is currently a largely open question in astrophysics .",
    "reviews can be found in mckee & hollenbach ( 1980 ) and draine & mckee ( 1993 ) .",
    "our study is motivated by a need to understand the structure of the post - shock region in balmer - dominated supernova remnants ( snrs ; heng & mccray 2007 , hereafter hm07 , and references therein ) , which we term the `` shock transition zone '' . these snrs typically have shock velocities @xmath12 km s@xmath5 , ages much less than the radiative cooling times and produce a modest amount of ionizing radiation .",
    "balmer - dominated snrs have two - component spectra consisting of a broad and a narrow line ( chevalier , kirshner & raymond ( 1980 , hereafter ckr80 ; see  [ subsect : bdsnr ] ) . if the temperatures of the atoms and ions are known , the width of the broad line is uniquely related to the shock velocity , as first shown by ckr80 the upstream , pure hydrogen gas consists of atoms and ions ( @xmath13 k ) with a typical pre - shock ion fraction of @xmath14 .",
    "the atoms are converted into ions via charge transfer ( with protons ) and impact ionization ( with both electrons and protons ) in the transition zone ( fig .",
    "[ fig : zone ] ) , which has a width on the order of the mean free path of interactions .",
    "if a noticeable variation of the ion velocity occurs within the transition zone , then for a given broad line width , the shock velocity would be _ under - estimated_. this is because charge transfer events , which give rise to broad h@xmath6 emission , are favored at low relative velocities between the atoms and ions , which may occur within the transition zone . in ",
    "[ subsect : bdsnr ] , we show this _ not _ to be the case .",
    "the second reason for investigating the structure of balmer - dominated snrs is that ly@xmath6 resonant scattering occurs in the freely streaming debris of young , core - collapse snrs that are still in the pre - sedov - taylor phase .",
    "photons produced at the shock fronts undergo a spectral random walk and become increasingly redshifted as the debris is in hubble - like flow .",
    "ly@xmath6 line profiles will therefore be distorted with respect to non - resonant lines such as h@xmath6 ( if the hydrogen atoms are mostly in the ground state ) .",
    "photon production occurs within the shock transition zone , the width of which is usually greater than the mean free path of the ly@xmath6 photons .",
    "therefore , understanding the spatial structure of the transition zone in balmer - dominated snrs is relevant to modeling the ly@xmath6 lines in young remnants like snr 1987a , where resonant scattering occurs in the hydrogen ejecta from the massive progenitor .",
    "the third motivation for our study is to develop a new method for deriving the spatial emissivity profiles of both the broad and narrow h@xmath6 lines behind the shock front .",
    "raymond et al . ( 2007 , hereafter r07 ) have shown that such profiles can be used to infer @xmath3 , the total pre - shock density ( including both atoms and ions ) .    in  [",

    "[ sect : results ] . in ",
    "[ sect : discussion ] , we discuss the implications and limitations of our results and present opportunities for future work .",
    "for the problem to be tractable , we need to make a few simplifying assumptions .",
    "firstly , the only significant sink term present for the atoms is for their conversion to ions , via charge transfer and impact ionization . in the frame of the shock ,",
    "the atoms comprise a beam with a velocity of @xmath15 .",
    "the ions are shocked and isotropized in a distance comparable to the cyclotron gyroradius ( @xmath16 cm ) .",
    "we assume that the ion distribution function becomes approximately maxwellian in a length scale that is much less than the width of the shock transition zone .",
    "plasma instabilities are capable of partially equilibrating the temperatures between the electrons and protons ( @xmath17 for @xmath18 km s@xmath5 ; cargill & papadopoulos 1988 ; rakowski , ghavamian & hughes 2003 ; ghavamian , laming & rakowski 2007 ) .",
    "we parametrize the ratio of the temperatures at the shock front by @xmath19 hereafter , we drop the `` @xmath20 '' subscript when referring to variables describing the ion fluid .",
    "the length scale for equilibration is determined by coulomb collisions and can be much larger than the physical extent of the snr for @xmath21 .",
    "it is generally larger than @xmath22 and the length scale for atomic interactions , @xmath23 @xmath1 @xmath2 .      in the shock transition zone , the atomic beam ( number density @xmath24 and velocity @xmath25 ) interacts with maxwellian ions ( density @xmath26 , velocity @xmath27 and temperature @xmath28 ) . charge transfers between the atomic beam and post - shock protons produce populations of atoms having velocity distributions intermediate between a beam and a maxwellian , which we term `` broad neutrals '' .",
    "the resulting `` skewed maxwellian '' distributions are described in hm07 .",
    "these broad neutrals are produced in the same transition zone as the ions .",
    "we shall show how to account for the broad neutrals in ",
    "[ sect : threefluid ] . in this section ,",
    "we assume low neutral fractions ( @xmath29 ) so that the broad neutrals will not affect the density of the ions significantly .",

    "the internal energy density and pressure of the ion fluid are represented by @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "the set of equations is supplemented by the following equations of state : @xmath34 in the case of full equilibration ( @xmath35 ) , we have @xmath36 , where the factor of 2 accounts for contributions from both electrons and protons . the polytropic index is @xmath37 for a monoatomic gas .",
    "the rate coefficient , @xmath38 , characterizes the loss of atoms by conversion to ions via both charge transfer and ionization .",
    "examples of @xmath38 are shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : rates ] ; these rates assume a relative velocity of @xmath39 between the atoms and the peak of the ion distribution . for @xmath40",

    "details on how to calculate @xmath38 for a general relative velocity are given in appendix [ append : rates ] .",
    "suppose we can define a typical value for the rate coefficient , @xmath42 .",
    "then a natural length scale for the problem emerges : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the pre - shock atomic density .",
    "knowledge of @xmath45 allows us to define the dimensionless distance , @xmath46 .",
    "other dimensionless variables follow naturally : @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "the system of equations then becomes : @xmath52 = \\eta_{\\rm{h } } \\eta \\sr,\\nonumber\\\\ & \\frac{d}{d\\zeta}\\left [ \\eta u^3 + 5\\left(\\beta+1\\right ) \\eta \\epsilon u \\right ] = \\eta_{\\rm{h } } \\eta \\sr .",

    "only three of the conservation constants are independent ; the other three are a simple , linear combination of the first three .",

    "an atom gets excited @xmath63 times before it gets taken out of the beam ( hm07 ) .",

    "excitation and subsequent emission of ly@xmath6 photons extract increments of 10.2 ev from the atomic beam ; energy losses due to balmer and other lyman lines are a @xmath72 effect for @xmath73 km s@xmath5 shocks .",
    "at low and intermediate values of @xmath11 , the creation of the broad neutrals competes effectively with that of the ions . in this case",
    "we must generalize the hydrodynamical equations to a three - component model , consisting of the beam of atoms ( `` h '' ) , the electrons and protons ( `` i '' ) , and the broad neutrals ( `` b '' ) . here",
    "we assume that the broad neutrals and ions share a common fluid velocity , @xmath74 , which implies that they share a common temperature as well ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "this approximation has been employed in all of the papers before hm07 , who showed that the steep velocity dependence of the charge transfer cross section creates significant differences between @xmath76 and @xmath27 ( and hence @xmath77 and @xmath28 ) for shock velocities @xmath78 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the full three - component model requires @xmath79 , which is beyond the scope of our present study ( see  [ sect : future ] ) .",

    "[ sect : results ] , the velocity of the proton fluid is decelerated to @xmath207 almost immediately , and the subsequent evolution of @xmath27 is weak . this validates the thin shock assumption made by ckr80 and hm07 and highlights a puzzle  how does one account for the excessive amount of broad ( `` interior '' ) emission observed in snr 1987a ( heng et al .",
    "2006 ; hm07 ) ? more optical / ultraviolet spectroscopic studies of snr 1987a are needed to shed light on the issue .",
    "another relevant quantity to examine is the spatial shift between the centroids , the centroid is defined as the point @xmath219 such that @xmath220 .",
    "] of @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles ] , we compute @xmath8 and @xmath9 for @xmath161 and @xmath221 @xmath167 , over the range @xmath222 km s@xmath5 , as well as for @xmath21 and 1 .",
    "( again , as a matter of illustration , we assume case b conditions for the narrow h@xmath6 line . )",
    "then , for @xmath223 , we determine the _ dimensionless _ spatial shift , @xmath10 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] ) , which is the spatial shift normalized by @xmath45 . at any given shock velocity",
    ", @xmath10 decreases with increasing @xmath11 .",
    "this is explained by the fact that at high neutral fractions ( low @xmath11 ) , there are initially only a small number of ions available ; the system drifts along until there are enough ions to create the broad neutrals .",
    "hence , the length scale for the creation of broad neutrals is relatively larger , corresponding to a greater shift in the centroid of @xmath8 . for a fixed value of @xmath11",
    ", @xmath10 decreases as the shock velocity increases , for @xmath224 km s@xmath5 .",
    "this is because charge transfer reactions are favored at lower velocities and the larger number of broad neutrals created ensures that the centroid of @xmath8 is shifted farther downstream .",
    "this behavior is not true for shocks with @xmath225 km s@xmath5 , as the charge transfer cross section becomes nearly constant with velocity .",
    "observationally , it should be possible to measure @xmath10 with wfc3 onboard the _ hubble space telescope _ if one isolates the narrow h@xmath6 component with a narrow band filter",
    ". such measurements can be used to constrain @xmath3 in some snrs .      though the velocity of the broad neutrals and ions has no spatial structure , the densities of the atoms , broad neutrals and ions vary across the width of the shock transition zone . as mentioned in  [ sect : intro ] , knowledge of the density structures is relevant to modeling ly@xmath6 resonant scattering in young , core - collapse snrs .",
    "photons are produced within the transition zone and resonantly scatter with a path length @xmath226 , where @xmath227 is the time since the supernova explosion in units of 10 years and @xmath228 is the temperature of the freely streaming ejecta .",
    "there is evidence for ly@xmath6 resonant scattering in snr 1987a ( michael et al . 2003 ; heng et al .",
    "2006 ) ; while we now know how the density evolves spatially , it is beyond the scope of this paper to model the scattering process and observed spectra .",
    "it is , however , worthy to note that for @xmath4 km s@xmath5 ( @xmath229 ) and @xmath29 , the approximate , two - component solution for @xmath230 becomes a good one .",
    "the interested reader is referred to zheng & miralda - escud ( 2002 ) and tasitsiomi ( 2006 ) for the physics of ly@xmath6 resonant scattering .",
    "we have constructed a three - component model where we employed the simplifying assumption @xmath231 . at @xmath232",
    "km s@xmath5 , impact excitation and ionization become competitive with charge transfer , and the resulting skewed maxwellian of the broad neutrals peaks at @xmath233 .",
    "the quantity @xmath234 is sensitive to changes in @xmath76 , which is relevant to the determination of @xmath235 .",
    "therefore , a @xmath236 treatment is necessary ( m. van adelsberg et al .",
    "2007 , in preparation ) . before ( ckr80 and hm07 ) , the ratio of broad to narrow h@xmath6 _ rates _ , i.e. , @xmath237 .",
    "the rate is defined as the value of @xmath237 at a fixed value of @xmath238 . ]",
    "was assumed to be equal to the ratio of _ rate coefficients _ , as the densities of the atoms , ions and broad neutrals were assumed to be constant .",
    "physically , a full three - component model will answer the following question : for two balmer - dominated snrs with the same shock velocity , do we expect the ratio of broad to narrow h@xmath6 _ rates _ to be the same if one is highly ionized and the other is largely neutral ?",
    "there are several important aspects of the hydrogen emission from non - radiative shocks that remain to be explored .",
    "if a significant fraction of the energy dissipated by a shock goes into cosmic rays , a precursor will heat and accelerate the gas before it reaches the shock transition zone , altering the density and velocity jumps and changing the post - shock ion temperatures ( blandford & eichler 1987 ; drury et al .",
    "evidence for such a precursor is found in the anomalously large widths of the narrow h@xmath6 lines in balmer - dominated shocks ( sollerman et al .",
    "furthermore , when a pre - shock atom is ionized upstream , it effectively becomes a `` pick - up ion '' , analogous to those observed in inter - planetary space ( kallenbach et al .",
    "these pick - up ions are preferentially accelerated to become anomalous cosmic rays . in snr shocks",
    ", they may form an isotropic , mono - energetic population that might perturb the balmer line profiles .",
