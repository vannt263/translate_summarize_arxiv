    "self - avoiding walks ( saw ) on the integer lattice give a simple model of polymers in a dilute solution or more generally random configurations whose only constraint is given by a self - repulsion . in the saw problem on a lattice , e.g. , @xmath9 , one considers nearest neighbor walks on the lattice which visit each lattice site at most once .",
    "the basic principle of the standard saw model is that all walks of a given length ( perhaps constrained to have a certain starting point or to stay in a certain subset ) are given the same measure .",
    "we will consider only @xmath10 in this paper , but the problem is interesting for all @xmath11 ; see @xcite for an overview .",
    "the classic problem for which there are few rigorous results is to understand the asymptotic behavior as @xmath12 tends to infinity of the uniform probability measure on the set of saw s of @xmath12 steps starting at the origin . among the open questions is a proof that the _ infinite _ saw exists .",
    "the latter should be the probability measure on infinite saw s starting at the origin such that for a finite length saw @xmath1 , the probability of the set of infinite walks that start with @xmath1 is equal to the limit as @xmath13 of the fraction of saw s of length @xmath12 that start with the walk @xmath1 .",
    "a different question is to find the scaling limit of the infinite saw which should be very closely related to the scaling limit of the uniform measure .",
    "the scaling limit should be obtained by replacing the lattice with unit spacing by a lattice with spacing @xmath14 and letting @xmath14 go to zero .",
    "one can ask a similar question about saw s restricted to stay in a half - plane . in this case",
    ", it can be proved that the infinite half - plane saw exists .",
    "however , it is still open to prove that it has a scaling limit .",
    "it is believed that the saw is one of the planar models that exhibits conformal invariance in the scaling limit . in @xcite , see also @xcite , precise conjectures were made about the kind of scaling limit .",
    "we state one version of the conjecture now .",
    "let us write @xmath15 and let @xmath16 .",
    "for each positive integer @xmath7 , consider the set of saw s starting at @xmath17 , ending at @xmath18 and otherwise staying in @xmath19 .",
    "to each such walk @xmath1 we assign weight equal to @xmath6 . here",
    "@xmath3 denotes the number of steps on @xmath1 and @xmath4 is the inverse of the connective constant defined roughly by saying that the number of saw s of length @xmath20 in @xmath21 starting at the origin grows like @xmath22 .",
    "it is important to note that although walks of the same length get the same measure , walks of different length are not weighted the same . if @xmath23 , let @xmath24 denote the corresponding partition function , that is , the sum of weights of all the walks in @xmath25 that end at @xmath26 and let @xmath27 .",
    "( it is not obvious that @xmath28 is finite .",
    "this was proved in @xcite , and we give a proof in section [ sect_saw_strip ] . ) let @xmath29 , @xmath30 denote the corresponding probability measures on paths obtained by normalizing by @xmath31 respectively .",
    "then the conjectures are :    * there exists a scaling exponent @xmath32 and a scaling function @xmath33 such that @xmath34 * if @xmath35 such that @xmath36 then the measures @xmath37 have a scaling limit which is a probability measure @xmath38 on paths in @xmath39 connecting @xmath17 and @xmath40 . * similarly , the measures @xmath30 have a scaling limit which is a probability measure @xmath41 on paths in @xmath39 connecting @xmath17 and some point on the upper boundary of @xmath39 , and which can be written as @xmath42 * the probability measures @xmath38 are invariant under conformal transformations .",
    "for example , if @xmath43 is a conformal transformation with @xmath44 , then the image of @xmath45 under @xmath46 is @xmath38 .",
    "( here probability measures are considered on paths modulo reparametrization . )",
    "more generally , if one has a simply connected domain @xmath47 and two boundary points @xmath48 , one expects to get a probability measure @xmath49 in the scaling limit , and that these measures will be conformally invariant . in general ,",
    "lattice corrections that persist in the scaling limit will require a more complicated form for the partition function than seen in , but we will not worry about this here .",
    "the conjecture suggests that we should have the following scaling rule for the function @xmath33 .",
    "if @xmath50 is a conformal transformation with @xmath44 , then @xmath51 we give a heuristic argument for in section [ sect_sim_part_func ] .",
    "in @xcite , it was shown that if the infinite half - plane saw has a conformally invariant limit then the limit must be the chordal schramm - loewner evolution sle with exponent @xmath52 . using this and rigorous results about sle @xcite , predictions for critical exponents for the saw",
    "were rederived .",
    "in particular , one predicts @xmath53 because these predictions rely on the assumption of the conformally invariant limit , they are not rigorous derivations",
    ". this conjecture also led to new predictions about the behavior of saw , e.g. , the probability that a half - plane saw hits a slit emanating from the real line .",
    "these new conjectures were tested numerically in @xcite , and the simulations were very consistent with the predictions .",
    "these simulations give more evidence to believe the assumption of a conformally invariant limit .",
    "the work in @xcite sampled from the infinite half - plane saw ( more precisely , it sampled from the uniform measure on very long half - plane walks and then restricted the measure to a smaller initial segment of the path ) , and hence did not give a test of the scaling conjecture for a bounded domain .",
    "the finite scaling rule is difficult to test for two reasons :    * the pivot algorithm , which is the fastest method for producing saw s , chooses walks from the uniform measure on walks of a fixed number of steps ( perhaps restricted to the half - plane ) .",
    "it seems much harder to simulate quickly from the measure where paths are weighted by @xmath54 * unless the boundary of our domain consists of straight lines parallel to the coordinate axes , the lattice corrections in the scaling rule are very difficult to understand .    in this paper",
    ", we test the conjectures by considering walks in @xmath19 .",
    "the limit domain @xmath39 has only horizontal edges , so one does not expect problems in the lattice corrections . also , as we will show in section [ sect_inf_half ]",
    ", sampling from @xmath30 is the same as sampling from the infinite half - plane saw and conditioning on having a `` bridge '' or `` horizontal cut '' at @xmath7 .",
    "our work was motivated by @xcite who considered bridges of @xmath55 .",
    "using the prediction @xmath56 and the scaling rule , we will see in section [ sect_sim_part_func ] that the predicted scaling limit for @xmath30 is @xmath57 where @xmath58^{-5/4},\\ ] ] and @xmath38 is the probability measure associated to chordal @xmath55 from @xmath17 to @xmath40 in @xmath39 . for the scaling limit of @xmath30 we consider three main random variables : the distribution of the real part of the endpoint ( which should have density @xmath59 in the limit ) , the distribution of the rightmost excursion of the path , and the probability that the path passes to the left of a fixed @xmath60 .",
    "the last probability was first computed for each @xmath38 by schramm @xcite and one obtains it for @xmath41 by integrating .",
    "we are very pleased to find our simulations give strong numerical evidence for the finite scaling conjectures .",
    "this paper is divided into two parts .",
    "the next section is theoretical and establishes mathematically the relationship between the infinite half - plane saw and the measure on paths weighted by @xmath6 .",
    "we decided to make this section self - contained except for one difficult estimate of kesten .",
    "in particular , the existence of measures on infinite bridges and half - plane saw s in @xcite are reproved .",
    "we include a discussion of half - plane walks started at interior points although we do not do simulations from this measure . in the last section we give a heuristic argument for , and",
    "then discuss the results of the simulations in detail .",
    "in this section we review some facts about the infinite self - avoiding half - plane walk .",
