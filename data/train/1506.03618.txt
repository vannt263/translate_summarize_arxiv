    "at the present the late time accelerated expansion of the universe is a widely accepted fact supported by different independent observations @xcite .",
    "recently , several modifications of gravity have been proposed in order to explain this acceleration , however it is not clear if behind these generalizations of the einstein - hilbert action there is a modification or extension of some physical principle . therefore , there is not a formal framework to guide the exploration of these models .",
    "every modification of gravity should provide similar predictions to those of the @xmath11cdm model , nevertheless this occurs only at some scales or in certain scenarios , e.g. , the expansion of the universe at low @xmath14 or in the solar system tests .",
    "these modifications are different from each other , so every one of them should provide some signature to be distinguished from the others . because of the lack of a formal guidance , the principal line of exploration for any model of modified gravity is to impose observational constraints on their parameters relying on the high accuracy of the current data .",
    "the @xmath4 gravity constitute a natural extension of general relativity in the sense that almost all of its desirable properties remain intact .",
    "one of the changes introduced by the dependence of the gravitational action on a general function of the ricci scalar , @xmath4 , is that we increase the number of degrees of freedom , resulting in a different set of field equations and consequently in modified dynamics for the gravitational systems .",
    "@xcite    among the components of these modified gravities which can be tested are the equation of state ( eos ) of the dark energy component and the growth factor .",
    "the values used in performing these tests can be obtained , in an indirect way , from astronomical measurements .",
    "these analyses depend on the value of the matter density today @xmath15 , for both dark and barionic components and even a small change can produce significant differences in the behavior of these models .",
    "it is worth mentioning that for @xmath4 gravity an additional problem emerges , that is the necessity of a unique definition for the eos of the geometric dark energy @xcite .    in these context ,",
    "sahni _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a new test in order to distinguish between acceleration produced by a cosmological constant term and that coming from a modified gravity model .",
    "now that results at different redshift for the hubble parameter @xmath16 are available from the observations of barionic acoustic oscillations ( bao ) , it is possible to implement this test for @xmath11cdm as well as for modified theories of gravity .    among the more successful models in @xmath4 we find that of starobinsky @xcite and the proposed by hu @xmath3 sawicki @xcite .",
    "these models have proved to be viable at low redshift @xmath17 . in the present work we analyze them to verify their applicability at a higher redshift @xmath18 which is",
    "is within the scale of validity for tests using the bao data .    in the next section",
    "we will present the approach that we are using @xcite in order to integrate the modified friedman equations and the @xmath4 models we will explore . in section iii the @xmath19 in introduced as well as the two - ponit relation @xmath20 that is used as a model independent test in this paper .",
    "section iv shows the results for the @xmath21 diagnostic for the @xmath4 models and they are compared with the @xmath11cdm model . finally , in section v we present teh conclusion of this work",
    "as we have mentioned , @xmath4 theories of gravity are the most straightforward way to extend the hilbert - einstein action .",

    "these two models are currently the most successful among the proposed @xmath4 modified gravity descriptions and both pass the solar system tests .",

    "sahni _ et al . _ proposed @xcite a test to distinguish @xmath11cdm from modified gravity models or some other mechanism to describe the late acceleration of the universe .",
    "the test is based on the function @xmath55 defined as    @xmath56    with @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the @xmath55 function is constant for an accelerated expansion described by means of a cosmological constant term instead of a modified gravity model .",
    "in fact , in such case we have that @xmath59 , thus @xmath60 and any deviation from zero would discard @xmath11cdm as a model for the expansion of the universe . in a modified gravity description @xmath61 is not constant but evolves with @xmath14 , showing a particular behavior for each theory .",
    "a remarkable characteristic of this test is that it depends only on the values of @xmath62 which are determined by observations .",
    "shafieloo _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a diagnostic by using the @xmath55 function at two different points .",
    "this way we can take observations about the determination of @xmath62 at several redshifts and then we can compute the two point relation given by    @xmath63    later , sahni _ et al . _ in @xcite proposed a small modification to this test which allows to compare different theoretical predictions using the two - point diagnostic of shafieloo _ et al .",
    "they multiply eq . by @xmath64 with @xmath65 obtaining    @xmath66    written in this forms , this little change",
    "have the advantage that we can use that under the @xmath11cdm model @xmath67 from planck xvi 2013 @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that , by using this test , observations suggest that the value of @xmath5 is not constant . taking @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 with @xmath71 @xcite , @xmath72 @xcite and @xmath73 @xcite the values for the @xmath5 two - point relation ( eq .",

    "we have considered just this value for the @xmath11cdm model as this is the value obtained in the best fit given by the planck team @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we apply this diagnostic to two @xmath4 models .",
    "we will present the @xmath1 function , the two - point relation @xmath80 will be also computed in bothj cases . @xmath4",
    "results will be compared with @xmath11cdm in terms of the cumulative probability .",
    "we have intruduced by now the way we will integrate the field equations in cosmology and also the test we will use as a diagnostic for two @xmath4 models . to perform the analysis we proceeded as follows .",
    "we integrate the differential equations ( [ tracert ] ) and ( [ hdotgen ] ) under the ricci scalar approach fixing the initial conditions at some point in the past where it is safe to assume domination of matter and normalizing in order to fix the values of @xmath15 .",
    "( for details about cosmological integration in the context of the ricci scalar approach see @xcite ) .",
    "it is important to mention that we are taking into account a radiation component in the emt .",
    "nevertheless , this has no a significant effect in the results when integrating in the periods we are considering , i.e. @xmath81 .    the value of @xmath15 , assumed in the theoretical prediction , is crucial in order to have a better agreement with the values of the two - point relation given in ( [ omhz1z3 ] ) . in any case",
    "it is clear that , even if such changes are considered , the @xmath11cdm model can only give constant values for the @xmath1 function , and consequently it gives constant values for the two - point relation ( [ om ] ) .    here",
    "we explore different values of @xmath15 for each @xmath4 model : @xmath82 ( which corresponds to the value expected under the @xmath11cdm model ) and also @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 . in fig .",
