    "light sources with a temporal resolution down to femtoseconds are readily available .",
    "in contrast , achieving a spatial resolution relevant for nanostructures , i.e. below the optical wave length , is a challenge .",
    "one way is to utilize the light - matter interaction to ignite and tune carriers dynamics . for instance",
    ", a triggered ultrafast charge current nano loop generates an equally localized magnetic field that steers selectively the properties of magnetic nanoparticles .",
    "as demonstrated below , such a scenario is realized by an optical vortex beam triggering a valence charge current loop on a fullerene sphere .",
    "these fullerenes , as for instance dysc@xmath0n@c@xmath4@xcite , may encapsulate endohedral molecular magnets that are shielded and have thus a long relaxation time which makes them good candidates for sensing and ( quantum ) information applications .",
    "gd@xmath5n@c@xmath4 @xcite and n@c@xmath6 @xcite are further experimentally feasible magnetic endofullerenes with interesting applications@xcite .",
    "the present study relies on the idea of transferring light orbital angular momentum to bound degenerate states in fullerenes leading to the emergence of a magnetic orbital moment .",
    "we evaluate then the magnetic field inside the fullerene cage due to the respective surface charge currents . to this end",
    "two established facts are important : + _ i ) _ recent experiments @xcite and first principle calculations @xcite unveiled the existence of so - called super atomic molecular orbitals ( samos ) in c@xmath6 which are diffuse , _ unoccupied _ orbitals _ bound _ by the ( molecular cage ) central potential and have thus well - defined orbital angular momenta ( @xmath7 , and @xmath8 ) ; they extend way beyond the site - defined bound @xmath9 orbitals and hence they are less affected by doping or modifications of the geometry . indeed ,",
    "_ ab initio _",
    "calculations suggest the existence of samos for larger or doped fullerenes .",
    "even , for various bowl - shaped fragments of @xmath9-conjugated molecules samos are present @xcite . here",
    "we exploit these properties of samos for photo - generating surface charge current loops , and hence internal , nanoscale magnetic field pulses which act on encapsulated magnetic moments , e.g. n@c@xmath6 @xcite . as our ab - initio calculations explicitly demonstrate",
    "n@c@xmath6 @xcite possess indeed samos that we may employ for magnetic pulse generation ( cf . supplementary materials ) .",
    "+ _ ii ) _ special type of structured light pulses will be used , namely optical vortices with a topological charge that sets the amount of orbital angular momentum ( oam ) transferrable when interacting with matter .",
    "such oam beams have found an impressively wide range of applications @xcite .",
    "of particular relevance here are the recently generated fs oam pulses @xcite and oam sources in the vuv and euv regimes @xcite . due to phase singularity , the intensity of the oam beam vanishes on the optical axis and",
    "rises to form a ring shape with a radius determined by the beam s waist ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig : scheme ] ) .",
    "the advantage of pumping current - carrying samos with linear polarized oam beam is that one is not restricted to the conventional optical propensity rules .",
    "so the current ( and therefore the magnetic moment ) can be enhanced by increasing the topological charge for fixed moderate pulse intensity , as demonstrated below .",
    "furthermore , for larger systems , e.g. ring structures @xcite , one may use the oam spatial structure to couple locally to the system ( i.e. , only to the sphere region but not to the endohedral objects ) . as schematically shown in fig.[fig : scheme ] , in the case of c@xmath6 the extension of the diffraction - limited beam is much larger than that of the cage .",
    "hence , it is relevant to inspect the charge - current dependence on the distance @xmath10 between c@xmath6 center and the optical axis . perhaps unexpected",
    ", we find a smooth dependence of the magnetic moment on @xmath10 .",
    "the increase of the field intensity with @xmath10 counter - acts the amount of oam ( with respect to the center of the cage ) acquired by samos , which means , in a dilute gas - phase collection of c@xmath6 distributed over the oam beam spot roughly the same magnetic field is generated in the cage . as demonstrated here ,",
    "this magnetic field can be tuned in sign and amplitude by varying the properties of the oam beam , such as the topological charge , the intensity , the waist , or the frequency .",
    "we consider a linearly polarized , monochromatic laguerre - gaussian oam pulse with a topological charge @xmath11 and frequency @xmath12 .",
    "plane , perpendicular to the light propagation direction .",
    "the vector @xmath13 ( @xmath14 marks the position of the electron ( optical axis ) relative to the molecule center of mass .",
    "the vector @xmath15 denotes the position of the electron with respect to the optical axis .",
    "the shaded area is the light high intensity region ( not to scale).,width=226 ]    the vector potential in cylindrical coordinates with the @xmath16-axis chosen along the light propagation ( with a wave vector @xmath17 ) is given by @xcite : @xmath18 @xmath19 is the polarization vector and @xmath20 is the pulse temporal envelope .",
    "@xmath21 is the polar angle relative to the optical axis of the laser field . of interest here",
    "is the dynamics transversal to @xmath17 . for the photon energies @xmath22 used here as well as for the size of the molecule ( @xmath23 ) we deduce @xmath24 , i.e. the dipole approximation is acceptable along the @xmath16-axis .",
    "the radial structure is described by the function @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the distance in the @xmath27 plane to the optical axis and can be translated to @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 indexes the radial nodes .",
    "the functions @xmath30 are the generalized laguerre polynomials . for illustration",
    "we assume @xmath31 , i.e. @xmath32 . the case of @xmath33 presents no further complications ( and adds no further qualitative information ) .",
    "@xmath34 is the beam waist setting the extent of the optical vortex .",
    "highest intensities are around @xmath35 .",
    "we will employ a diffraction - limited beam implying that @xmath36 , i.e. , in our simulation we used a waist @xmath37 nm to cover up the photon energies @xmath22 in a range from 5  ev to 18  ev . for a reasonable comparison of the generated magnetic moments as a function of different topological charges we use a normalized amplitude of the vector potentials such that @xmath38 thus , the vector potential normalization is set by @xmath39 .",
    "+        as we are interested in non - invasive , direct one - photon nearly resonant generation of samos loop current , the choice of the pulse parameters is a key as issue : the beam should have a moderate intensity @xmath40 and uv - frequencies @xmath12 . its duration should be short but allows for few optical cycles . increasing the generated current",
    "is achieved not by increasing the pulse intensity but by increasing @xmath11 .",
    "the energetic positions of samos are very helpful : as @xmath41 is the small parameter in time - dependent perturbation theory , for @xmath12 being in the uv regime , @xmath40 can be chosen relatively high while strong field or tunneling effects remain marginal and only single photon processes contribute . furthermore , since @xmath12 is far off vibronic as well as plasmonic modes , no heating nor internal field effects are operational during excitations . thus , by tuning @xmath12 in resonance with samos one generates a non - destructive , relatively long - lived ( after pulse ) current loops . for the theoretical treatment ,",

    "the calculations of the ground state wave functions and energies were performed using the hf method which is implemented in the gaussian 03 quantum chemistry package @xcite .",
    "the single particle states of the molecule can be grouped in radial bands characterized by the principal quantum number @xmath43 and have a well - defined angular quantum number @xmath44 .",
    "in addition to it they are further specified by @xmath45 which discriminates between the different representations of the @xmath42 symmetry group of the same angular momentum @xmath44 and @xmath46 which stands for the element within the multi - dimensional representation @xmath45 .",

    "the energy which corresponds to the electron state @xmath47 is characterized by @xmath51 . the lower band ( @xmath52 ) is occupied by 180 electrons , while we find 60 electrons in the second radial band . for @xmath53",
    "the energy dispersion follows nearly perfectly the parabolic dispersion @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the averaged radius of the molecule as in the @xmath42 symmetry the s , p , d orbitals transform as @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively . for larger @xmath44",
    "we find a small splitting of the energy levels due to the so(3)@xmath59 symmetry - breaking .",
    "however , this splitting is smaller than 0.5ev for the second radial band @xcite .",
    "the samos are bound virtual states occupying the third radial band ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "in contrast to their symmetry and radial structure ( which are essential for optical transitions ) , the exact energetic positions of samos turned out to be very delicate to capture theoretically due to correlation effects @xcite . in the following we consider only transitions between the second radial band with a maximal angular momentum quantum number @xmath61 and the third radial band filled with samos and characterized by @xmath62 . consequently the photon energy of the electromagnetic pulse is restricted to a range from 5  ev to 18  ev .",
    "+ using a gauge in which the scalar potential vanishes , the light matter interaction including transversal and longitudinal parts reads ( unless otherwise stated , we use atomic units and denote the momentum operator as @xmath63 ) @xmath64 .",
    "$ ] for the intensities used here the ponderomotive potential @xmath65 has no influence ( on the current anyway ) .",

    "i.e. , @xmath75 .",
    "standard perturbation theory @xcite yields the occupation probability of the state  @xmath76 after the pulse from the coefficients @xmath77 , where @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 is given by @xmath81 .",

    "the photoinduced current density after the interaction with the pulse ( @xmath83 ) can be evaluated according to + @xmath86 .",
    "generically , the current consists of a fast oscillating ( coherence ) current related to the time variation of the oscillating induced dipole and a slowly decaying ( population ) component , it is the latter one that generates loop current and hence orbital magnetic moment , as explicitly demonstrated for a quantum ring in ref.@xcite where also ( ps ) relaxation due to phonons were calculated . here",
    "we find the same current characteristics ( we do not calculate the vibrational relaxation but in @xcite we showed that samos initial decay due electronic processes is even slower than homo ) . now , suppose we are interested in current - induced processes , e.g. magnetic switching , with a time scale ( @xmath87 ) , say comparable to the typical current life - time ( effective decay constant @xmath88 ) , i.e. @xmath89 . the relevant dc current component is obtained by averaging the current @xmath90 over the fast oscillation @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the matrix element @xmath93 .",
    "we used that the time integral @xmath94 predominantly picks up contributions of the states fulfilling @xmath95 .",
    "therefore the sums over substates ( @xmath96 ) corresponding to the same @xmath97 are present in eq .",
    "[ eq : current ] .",
    "our numerical results show that only the angular components @xmath98 of the current density vector contributes because for the chosen frequency the ionization channel is suppressed .",
    "the magnetic moment induced by the current is calculated as @xcite : @xmath99 .",
    "$ ] since only the angular component @xmath98 contributes to the whole current density the magnetic moment points into the @xmath16-direction .",
    "the current density is located around the shell of the molecule ( see below ) .",
    "hence , the corresponding circulating current in the @xmath27-plane induces a magnetic field in the center of the molecule which can be calculated according to the biot - savart law @xcite : @xmath100",
    "as an illustration we choose a pulse with a fwhm of 10  fs ( @xmath101  a.u . ) and a beam waist of @xmath37  nm . we employ moderate intensities in the range of @xmath102  w/@xmath2 .",
    "[ fig : cur](a)-(c ) show the photoinduced magnetic moments in @xmath16-direction as a function of the fullerene position in the laser spot and the frequency of the linearly polarized oam pulse ( a gaussian pulse does not lift the degeneracy and hence does not generate any dc current ) .",
    "probably unexpected , at a fixed frequency , the magnetic moment has the same order of magnitude for fullerenes at different positions in the laser spot .",
    "this is not a generic behavior but due to our system size .",
    "the reason is that @xmath11 is defined with respect to the optical axis ( not with respect to the fullerene cage center ) .",
    "since @xmath103 molecules in the beam center ( @xmath104 ) are hardly excited due to the low intensity . on the other side for fullerenes at the beam peak intensity , i.e. @xmath105 , the distance between the optical axis and the molecule is very large .",
    "thus , the transferred oam when translated to oam with respect to the cage center is quite small .",
    "the interplay of those two extremes results in the relatively smooth dependence of the magnetic moment on the fullerenes spatial distribution .",
    "this is also endorsed by the optical selection rules for different @xmath11 and varying @xmath106 . for a ratio @xmath104 the transitions",
    "are governed by the selection rule @xmath107 and similar to @xcite .",
    "as the magnetic quantum number @xmath108 is not a good quantum number for fullerene the selection rule is restricted to @xmath44 .",
    "for @xmath109 the transfer of orbital angular momentum is small since the angle @xmath21 is very small [ cf . with fig .",

    "[ fig : bfield](a ) and ( b ) the current densities corresponding to the positive peak of the magnetic moment at 8.8  ev for @xmath105 and @xmath117 are shown . due to the nodal structure of samos , the current density forms three intensive intercalated ring structures in the @xmath27-plane and is nearly independent of the polar angle @xmath120 .",
    "the maximal current can be found in the @xmath27-plane .",
    "the influence of the topological charge is revealed by inspecting the magnetic field magnitude as @xmath11 varies ( cf .",

    "not surprisingly we find no generated magnetic field ( and no current ) for @xmath121 , as for a conventional linearly polarized gaussian beam .",
    "the maximal transferable amount of oam is given by @xmath122 , which is because the maximal orbital angular momentum of the third radial band is @xmath62 , i.e. only the transition @xmath123 is possible .",

    "a different picture is obtained in case ( @xmath105 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : bfield](d ) . in general a higher topological charge can be used for current generation . for small winding numbers",
    "the generated magnetic field shows a strong dependence , i.e. by changing @xmath11 from 1 to 2 the field strength is doubled .",
    "however , for values above 10 we find a saturation effect , due to the limited number of degenerate virtual states in the third radial band of the c@xmath125 molecule , meaning that the amount of the maximally transferrable orbital momentum is also set by the band structure .",
    "hence , oam beams for generating magnetic pulses come to their full advantage when @xmath11 is large and the virtual states are highly degenerate .",
    "the fact that samos seem to be ubiquitous @xcite for @xmath9-conjugated molecular and large structures , and very high @xmath11 is realizable @xcite , underlines the promising potential for oam - photo - assisted current generation in matter .",
    "we studied theoretically the possibility of generating internal charge currents in a c@xmath125 molecule by pumping with light carrying orbital angular momentum into the recently discovered super atomic molecular virtual orbitals .",
    "we predict a current generation leading to a magnetic pulse inside the cage in the range of mt . such magnetic field are well detectable , e.g. by using nitrogen - vacancy centers based magnetometry @xcite .",
    "the current can be tuned in sign and magnitude by changing the topological charge of the optical vortex .",
    "the pulse duration and intensity are additional tools for steering the generated magnetic field but also the underlying electronic structure can be exploited .",
    "larger objects possessing highly degenerate samos may accommodate much larger currents leading to higher magnetic fields . as the light frequency was tuned to samos and hence far off the plasmon frequency ,",
    "effects due to the induced fields play no relevant role here .",
    "the dynamics of plasmons driven by oam is currently in the scope of our research .",
    "summarizing , the results point to a new non - invasive way of ultrafast optical manipulation of magnetically active endohedrals .",
    "in fact tailored fs magnetic pulses are shown to lead to ballistic switching of magnetization occurring much faster than precessional switching @xcite . + this work was supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft under spp 1840 .",
