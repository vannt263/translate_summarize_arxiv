    "the atlas collaboration has carried out a detailed study to detect the susy signature in the framework of one of the most popular model , sugra  @xcite,@xcite .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that if susy exists at the electro - weak scale , it should be discovered by atlas and a general method has been given to determine approximately the mass scale of the susy particles . in subsequent papers  @xcite@xcite",
    "it was shown in five representative points of the parameter space that some of the susy particles can be reconstructed and using the obtained characteristics ( masses , branching ratios ) the model parameters can be precisely determined @xcite .",
    "all these studies have been carried out assuming that @xmath2 parity is conserved .    in this note",
    "we consider that @xmath2 parity is broken in such a way that the lepton number @xmath1 is violated through @xmath3-type couplings .",
    "the present experimental limits  @xcite can not completely exclude such a scenario . in this case",
    "one of the prominent signatures of susy , the missing energy is considerably weakened because the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) is allowed to decay . due to this decay",
    "the lepton and/or jet multiplicity increases considerably and some efficient cuts ( e.g. lepton veto against the @xmath8 background ) can not be applied . on the other hand ,",
    "the decay products of the lsp in some cases allow its direct reconstruction .",
    "therefore the event topology and the search strategies are different of the case when @xmath2 is conserved . this has motivated us to revisit the feasability to detect susy and to determine the parameters of the sugra model using the atlas detector .    in section 2",
    "we give a brief description of the phenomenology of the @xmath2 parity violation and the event generator used .",
    "section 3 deals with the atlas detector and with the fast simulation of its response . in section 4",
    "we present the domain of the parameter space where a susy signal can be expected by atlas . in the subsequent three sections the reconstruction of the susy particles and the determination of the model parameters are described in the lhc points 1,3 and 5 which represent a heavy , light and medium susy mass scale .",
    "we summarize the obtained results in the concluding section .",
    "0.5 cm      0.5 cm    @xmath2-parity has been introduced  @xcite in order to avoid fast nucleon decay and flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) .",
    "if the multiplicative quantum number @xmath9 is conserved it guarantees automatically baryon number ( @xmath10 ) and lepton number ( @xmath1 ) conservation .",
    "@xmath2 is + 1 for standard model ( sm ) particles and its value is -1 for their superpartners .",
    "the most important experimental consequences of the conservation of @xmath2 are that super partners should be produced in pairs and the lightest superpartner ( lsp ) should be stable .",
    "the lsp interacts weakly , therefore the prominent signature of susy in case of @xmath2 parity conservation is a considerable amount of missing ( transverse ) energy ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "although no violation of @xmath10 or @xmath1 has been observed yet , there is no firm theoretical argument which would require exact conservation of them and that of the @xmath2 parity .",
    "in fact the following term in the superpotential    @xmath12    which violates explicitely @xmath10 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 parity , can not be ruled out experimentally . here @xmath1 and @xmath13 are isodublet and isosinglet lepton , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are isodublet and isosinglet quark superfields , the indices @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 run for the three lepton and quark families .",
    "the suffix @xmath19 denotes charge conjugate .",
    "the first two terms violate explicitely @xmath1 whilst the last one violates @xmath10 .",
    "present limits on the proton lifetime suggests that either the @xmath1 or the @xmath10 violating terms ( i.e. the corresponding @xmath20 couplings ) should vanish for the first family .",
    "other experimental limits e.g. on lepton number violation : double @xmath6 decay , or on @xmath21 oscillation , etc .",
    "indicate that the couplings in equ .",
    "( [ eq : lag ] ) should nt be expected to exceed a few percent , and usually are much smaller than the gauge couplings .",
    "even so , if @xmath2 parity is violated the topology of the expected susy signal changes substantially . since the lsp is no more stable , the missing energy is considerably reduced",
    "on the other hand the decay products of the lsp increase the average number of jets and/or leptons in an event .",
    "in general , the event topology depends crucially on the size of the couplings .",
    "if , e.g. the couplings are of the order of @xmath22 or larger , the mass spectra , branching ratios , etc . will be different in the two cases where @xmath2 is conserved or violated .",
    "if however the couplings are smaller than the above value , the dominant effect of the @xmath2 parity violation is that the lsp becomes unstable .",
    "an estimation of the lsp lifetime as a function of the couplings show  @xcite that we can distinguish four subcases giving rise to different detection strategies : + @xmath23 @xmath24 + @xmath25 @xmath26 + @xmath27 @xmath28 + @xmath29 @xmath30 + in case @xmath23 only the event topology changes w.r.t .",
    "the case of @xmath2 conservation . in case @xmath25",
    "one can observe a displaced vertex at the lhc energies . in case",
    "@xmath27 the lsp decays outside of a typical lhc detector , however it can be catched by special purpose detectors  @xcite .",
    "finally the case @xmath29 can not be distinguished experimentally from the case of @xmath2 parity conservation .    in this study",
    "we have deliberately chosen to study case @xmath23 and compare the result with the case of @xmath2 parity conservation , because it represents a more difficult experimental situation than case @xmath25 where a displaced vertex could disentangle the lsp from the rest of the event .",
    "moreover we have assumed that @xmath31 and only one of the @xmath32 coupling is different from zero in equ .",
    "( [ eq : lag ] ) .",
    "nonzero @xmath33 and @xmath34 are subject of other reports inside atlas  @xcite .",
    "the hierarchical structure observed for the yukawa couplings in the sm motivates our hypothesis above .",
    "the lagrangian corresponding to the superpotential of equ .",
    "( [ eq : lag ] ) can be written in terms of particle fields for our case as :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are lepton fields , the tilde denotes the field of the superpartner , the @xmath19 stands for charge conjugation , @xmath38 for complex conjugation and @xmath39 are the flavor indices . as stated before , if the @xmath3 couplings are smaller than @xmath40 , which is our case , the sparticle mass spectrum practically does nt change and the main consequence of the @xmath2 parity violation is the decay of the lsp .",
    "this process is depicted in fig.[lspdecay1 ] where we assume that the lsp is the lightest neutralino ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the decay proceeds through an @xmath2 conserving and an @xmath2 violating vertex and in the final state there are always three leptons out of them at least two of _ different _ flavours , one neutral and the other two of opposite charges , since the lsp is supposed to be neutral .    the prominent signature of this type of susy event is the spectacular increase of `` stable '' leptons : electrons and muons in the final state .",
    "the neutral leptons , neutrinos , give rise to some missing transverse energy , but its magnitude is much less than that if @xmath2 parity is conserved .",
    "the flavour of the lepton in the final state depends on the values of the indices @xmath39 . since @xmath32 is antisymmetric in @xmath16 and @xmath17",
    "there are only 9 independent couplings which we choose as : @xmath42 .",
    "the first two families , 1 and 2 give rise always to `` stable '' leptons , electrons and muons , ( and the corresponding neutrinos ) in the final state . if an index 3 appears , the lepton is not stable if it is a @xmath43 , and its decay products are most of the time different from electrons or muons . since @xmath44 in equ .",
    "( [ eq : lag ] ) is an isosinglet , @xmath45 is a @xmath43 .",
    "the number of the stable leptons is the most prominent for @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "it is less spectacular , if an index 3 appears at the second place , and even less if the 3 appears in the third place .",
    "finally , if two indices have value of 3 one has the least number of stable leptons .",
    "on the other hand , the number of the neutrinos , and with that the magnitude of the missing energy increases in the order of the above mentioned cases .",
    "the expected extra number of stable charged leptons and neutrinos per each lsp decay for the different @xmath3 couplings calculated by the program @xcite are given in table  [ tb : brs ] .",
    "it is clear that the average number of the leptons for different flavours gives a strong hint on the coupling which is realized .",
    "e.g. the coupling @xmath47 gives rise predominantly to muons whilst the coupling @xmath48 results in equal number of electrons and muons , etc .",
