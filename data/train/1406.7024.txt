    "large explosions that expel hot , magnetized gases on the sun can , should they eventually envelop earth , effect severe disturbances in the geomagnetic field . these , in turn , cause geomagnetically induced currents ( gics ) to run through the surface layers of the earth and through conducting infrastructures in and on these , including the electrical power grids .",

    "impacts are likely strongest at mid to high geomagnetic latitudes , but low - latitude regions also appear susceptible @xcite .    the potential for severe impacts on the high - voltage power grid and thereby on society that depends on it has been assessed in studies by government , academic , and insurance industry working groups ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "non - catastrophic gic effects on the high - voltage electrical grid percolate into financial consequences for the power market @xcite leading to price variations on the bulk electrical power market on the order of a few percent @xcite .",
    "@xcite quantified the susceptibility of the u.s.high-voltage power grid to severe , yet not extreme , space storms , leading to power outages and power - quality variations related to voltage sags and frequency changes .",
    "they find , `` with more than 3@xmath1 significance , that approximately 4%  of the disturbances in the us power grid reported to the us department of energy are attributable to strong geomagnetic activity and its associated geomagnetically induced currents . ''",
    "the effects of gics on the high - voltage power grid can , in turn , affect the low - voltage distribution networks and , in principle , might impact electrical and electronic systems of users of those regional and local networks .",
    "a first indication that this does indeed happen was reported on in association with tests conducted by the idaho national laboratory ( inl ) and the defense threat reduction agency ( dtra ) .",
    "they reported @xcite that `` inl and dtra used the lab s unique power grid and a pair of 138kv core form , 2 winding substation transformers , which had been in - service at inl since the 1950s , to perform the first full - scale testing to replicate conditions electric utilities could experience from geomagnetic disturbances . '' in these experiments , the researchers could study how the artificial gic - like currents resulted in harmonics on the power lines that can affect the power transmission and distribution equipment .",
    "these `` tests demonstrated that geomagnetic - induced harmonics are strong enough to penetrate many power line filters and cause temporary resets to computer power supplies and disruption to electronic equipment , such as uninterruptible power supplies '' .    in parallel to that experiment , we collected information on insurance claims submitted to zurich north - america ( na ) for damage to , or outages of , electrical and electronic systems from all types of industries for a comparison with geomagnetic variability . here",
    ", we report on the results of a retrospective cohort exposure analysis of the impact of geomagnetic variability on the frequency of insurance claims .    for comparison purposes we repeat the analysis of the frequency of disturbances in the high - voltage electrical power grid as performed by @xcite for the same date range and with matching criteria for threshold setting and for the selection of the control samples . in section",

    "the procedure to test for any impacts of space weather on insurance claims and the high - voltage power grid is presented and applied in section  [ sec : testing ] .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusions ] where we also discuss the challenges in translating the statistics on claims and disturbances into an economic impact .",

    "information that might lead to identification of the insured parties was not disclosed .",
    "zurich na estimates that it has a market share of approximately 8%in north america for policies covering commercially - used electrical and electronic equipment and contingency business interruptions related to their failure to function properly during the study period . using that information as a multiplier suggests that overall some 12,800 claims",
    "are filed per average year related to electrical / electronic equipment problems in north - american businesses .",
    "the data available for this study can not reveal impacts on uninsured or self - insured organizations or impacts in events of which the costs fall below the policy deductable .    the 11-year period under study has the same duration as that characteristic of the solar magnetic activity cycle . fig .",

    "the bou and frd stations are located along the central latitudinal axis of the u.s .. the averaging of their measurements somewhat emphasizes the eastern u.s .  as do the grid and population that uses that . because the insurance claims use dates based on local time we compute the daily @xmath4 values based on date boundaries of u.s .",

    "@xcite compiled a list of `` system disturbances '' published by the north american electric reliability corporation ( nerc : available since 1992 ) and by the office of electricity delivery and energy reliability of the department of energy ( doe ; available since 2000 ) .",
    "this information is compiled by nerc for a region with over 300 million electric power customers throughout the u.s.a .  and in ontario and new brunswick in canada , connected by more than 340,000 km of high - voltage transmission lines delivering power generated in some 18,000 power plants within the u.s .",
    "the reported disturbances include , among others , `` electric service interruptions , voltage reductions , acts of sabotage , unusual occurrences that can affect the reliability of the bulk electric systems , and fuel problems . ''",

    "we refer to @xcite for more details .",
    "in order to quantify effects of geomagnetic variability on the frequency of insurance claims filed for electrical and electronic equipment we need to carefully control for a multitude of variables that include trends in solar activity , the structure and operation of the power grid .    we define a series of values of geomagnetic variability in order to form sets of dates including different ranges of exposure , i.e. , of geomagnetic variability , .",
    "we create exposure sets by selecting a series of threshold levels corresponding to percentages of all dates with the most intense geomagnetic activity as measured by the metric @xmath4 .",
    "specifically , we determined the values of @xmath4 for which geomagnetic activity , sorted from least active upward , includes 67% , 75% , 82% , 90% , 95% , and 98%  of all dates in our study period . for each threshold value we selected the dates with @xmath4 exceeding that threshold ( with possible further selection criteria as described below ) .",
    "for each percentile set we compute the daily rate of incident claims , @xmath6 , as well as , @xmath7 , as determined from the events in the day - by - day claims list .    in order to form",
    "tightly matched control samples for low `` exposure '' , we then select 3 dates within a 27-d period centered on each of the selected high - activity days .",
    "the 27-d period , also known as the bartels period , is that characteristic of a full rotation of the solar large - scale field as viewed from the orbiting earth ; @xmath4 values within that period sample geomagnetic variability as induced during one full solar rotation .",
    "this window for control sample selection is tighter than that used by @xcite who used 100-day windows centered on dates with reported grid disturbances . for the present study we selected a narrower window to put even stronger limits on the potential effects of any possible long - term trends in factors that might influence claims statistics or geomagnetic variability .",
    "we note that there is no substantive change in our main conclusions for control windows at least up to 100 days in duration .",
    "the three dates selected from within this 27-d interval are those with the lowest value of @xmath4 smoothed with a 3-day running mean .",
    "we determine the claim rate , @xmath8 , for this control set and the associated standard deviation in the mean , @xmath9 .",

    "we note that the relative rate of claims space weather is slightly higher for sample _ b _ than for the full set _ a _ consistent with the hypothesis that the claims omitted from sample _ a _ to form sample _ b _ were indeed preferentially unaffected by geomagnetic activity .",

    "we note that these two metrics , one for interference with commercial electrical / electronic equipment and one for high - voltage power , agree within the uncertainties , with the possible exception of the infrequent highest geomagnetic activity ( 98 percentile ) although there the statistical uncertainties on the mean frequencies are so large that the difference is less than 2 standard deviations .",

    "the claims data available to us do not allow a direct estimate of the financial impacts on industry of the malfunctioning equipment and the business interruptions attributable to such malfunctions : a sound assessment of the economic impact of space weather through the electrical power systems is a major challenge , but we can make a rough order - of - magnitude estimate based on existing other studies as follows .    the majority ( 59%  in sample b ) of the insurance claims studied here are explicitly attributed to `` misc .",
    ": electrical surge '' , which are predominantly associated with quality or continuity of electrical power in the low - voltage distribution networks to which the electrical and electronic components are coupled .",
    "many of the other stated causes ( see section  [ sec : claimsdata ] ) may well be related to that , too , but we can not be certain given the brevity of the attributions and the way in which these particular data are collected and recorded .",
    "knowing that in most cases the damage on which the insurance claims are based is attributable to perturbations in the low - voltage distribution systems , however , suggests that we can look to a study that attempted to quantify the economic impact of such perturbations on society .",
    "that study , performed for the consortium for electric infrastructure to support a digital society \" ( ceids ) @xcite , focused on the three sectors in the us economy that are particularly influenced by electric power disturbances : the digital economy ( including telecommunications ) , the continuous process manufacturing ( including metals , chemicals , and paper ) , and the fabrication and essential services sector ( which includes transportation and water and gas utilities ) .",
    "these three sectors contribute approximately 40%  of the us gross domestic product ( gdp ) .",
    "@xcite obtained information from a sampling of 985 out of a total of about 2 million businesses in these three sectors . the surveys assessed impact by `` direct costing '' by combining statistics on grid disturbances and estimates of costs of outage scenarios via questionnaires completed by business officials .",
    "information was gathered on grid disturbances of any type or duration , thus resulting in a rather complete assessment of the economic impact .",
    "the resulting numbers were corrected for any later actions to make up for lost productivity ( actions with their own types of benefits or costs ) .    for a typical year ( excluding , for example , years with scheduled rolling blackouts due to chronic shortages in electric power supply ) , the total annual loss to outages in the sectors studied is estimated to be $ 46billion , and to power quality phenomena almost $ 7billion . extrapolating from there to the impact on all businesses in the us from all electric power disturbances results in impacts ranging from $ 119billion / year to $ 188billion / year ( for about year-2000 economic conditions ) .    combining the findings of that impact quantification of all problems associated with electrical power with our present study on insurance claims",
    "suggests that , for an average year , the economic impact of power - quality variations related to elevated geomagnetic activity may be a few percent of the total impact , or several billion dollars annually .",
    "that very rough estimate obviously needs a rigorous follow - up assessment , but its magnitude suggests that such a detailed , multi - disciplinary study is well worth doing .",
