    "discerning the critical behavior taking place at a given phase transition by numerical simulations can be a very challenging problem , especially when one has to distinguish between a second order transition and a very weak first order transition .",
    "a beautiful example is given by the abelian compact @xmath0 gauge theory in four dimensions in the wilson discretization : in this formulation the theory is defined on the 4d euclidean hypercubic space - time lattice , the fundamental dynamical variables are the parallel transports along the links @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the lattice spacing ) and the action is : @xmath7 where the plaquette @xmath8 is defined as @xmath9 it is well known , since the early formulation of the model , that it has two different phases : a weak coupling coulomb phase and a strong coupling confined phase .",
    "the existence of these two phases was rigorously proved , for a different form of the action , in ref .",
    "@xcite , while for the wilson action evidence of this phase structure is based on numerical simulations ( for recent results see _ e.g. _ refs.@xcite ) . the nature of the transition separating the two phases has been debated for a long time , the final conclusion being that the transition is weak first order  @xcite .",
    "this conclusion is important since it implies that no continuum quantum field theory can be defined for the @xmath0 gauge theory at the critical point , since the correlation length stays finite .",
    "more recently , a finite temperature version of the model has been considered , in which the euclidean temporal size @xmath1 is compactified and kept fixed , while the thermodynamical limit is reached by sending to infinity the spatial sizes , @xmath10 .",
    "the model shows a non - trivial phase structure in the @xmath11 plane . for @xmath12 ,",
    "the system gets exactly decoupled into a 3d @xmath13 model and a 3d @xmath0 lattice gauge theory : the former undergoes a second order phase transition at @xmath14 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) while the latter is known to be always in the confined phase ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , therefore a single phase transition is expected , in the 3d xy universality class .",
    "such phase transition extends also to @xmath15 and corresponds to the spontaneous breaking of a symmetry analogous to that of the @xmath13 model , _",
    "i.e. _ a global @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "this is generated by gauge transformations which are periodic in time only up to a given global phase , and an order parameter for this symmetry is the wilson line taken along the euclidean temporal direction , _ i.e. _ the polyakov loop .",
    "for @xmath16 , the breaking of this symmetry corresponds to the confining - to - coulomb transition of the 4d theory , which is known to be first order .",
    "a possible further transition line may be present , in principle , separating a weak - coupling phase with spatial confinement at small @xmath1 from the zero - temperature coulomb phase , however evidence has been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite that such line could be actually placed at @xmath16 .",
    "a natural question is how the order of the @xmath0-breaking transition changes as one moves from @xmath12 , where it is second order , to @xmath17 , where it is first order .",
    "notice that , for every value of @xmath1 , the fact that an exact global symmetry exists guarantees that a true phase transition must be found , associated with its spontaneous breaking .    this issue has been discussed for the first time in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it has been proposed that the transition may stay first order at least for @xmath1 down to @xmath18 , turning into second order for lower @xmath1 .",
    "the evidence in that case was based on the analysis of the time histories on large lattices ( up to @xmath19 ) , showing clear signs of metastability . however , due to computational limitations , statistics presented in ref .",
    "@xcite were not enough to reach a definite conclusion .    on the contrary , in a subsequent investigation , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have suggested that a finite size scaling analysis gives evidence for a second order transition at @xmath18 , with critical indexes similar to that of a gaussian point ( see also ref .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite find gaussian indexes , instead of the expected xy indexes , also for smaller values of @xmath1 , down to @xmath20 .",
    "the problem in the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , as pointed out by the authors themselves and as we will clarify later , is the limited number of available spatial sizes , going up to @xmath21 , which does not permit a correct extrapolation to the thermodynamical limit .    in the present study",
    "we solve the issue , reconciling evidence from ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "in particular , we will show that the transition is indeed first order down to @xmath18 , turning into second order for lower values of @xmath1 .",
    "the separation between the two different regimes is marked , as it always happens in these cases , by a tricritical point , which , even if not exactly located at an integer value of @xmath1 , influences the scaling of nearby values of @xmath1 . as a consequence ,",
    "the correct scaling on such points , first order or second order , is not visible until large enough values of the spatial size @xmath22 are reached . on small lattices , instead",
    ", the true scaling behavior is obscured by a fake tricritical scaling , which has indeed the mean field tricritical ( gaussian ) indexes observed in ref .",
    "this variation of the scaling behavior with the lattice size is typical of tricritical points and is observed in monte carlo simulations of many other models , going from qcd at finite baryon chemical potential ( see e.g refs .",
    "@xcite ) to the potts model in an external magnetic field ( ref .",
    "the simplest physical systems which exhibit tricritical behavior are probably fluid mixtures but , as should also be clear from the previous discussion , tricritical phenomena appear to be ubiquitous in physics ( see _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in relation to our study ,",
    "particularly intriguing is the presence of tricritical points in superconductors ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) : ginzburg - landau theory of superconductivity is based on an @xmath0 gauge theory ( with matter ) and the tricritical behavior is triggered by vortex line defects , which are present also in the lattice @xmath0 gauge theory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ setup ]",
    "we present a general overview of the quantities and the methods adopted to probe the critical behavior around the transition ; in section  [ results ] we present and discuss numerical results obtained for various values of @xmath1 ; finally , in section  [ concl ] , we draw our conclusions .",
