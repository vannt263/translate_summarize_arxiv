    "the decay matrix element for @xmath1 into two virtual photons , represented by the cross hatched circle , is difficult to calculate from first principles .",
    "indeed the same problem occurs in the study of the decay @xmath46 @xcite .",

    "( [ eq6 ] ) and  ( [ eq8 ] ) , @xmath78    this estimated branching fraction is based on the assumption that @xmath68 is the same for the @xmath2 and @xmath79 decays .",
    "an unknown process present in the decay @xmath38 , but not in the decay @xmath80 , could result in a value of @xmath68 much larger in the @xmath2 mode , and thus a signal larger than the above limit .",
    "we used data collected by the cleo ii detector  @xcite at cesr .",
    "the components of the detector which are most critical to this study are the three concentric cylindrical drift chambers occupying the space 4 cm to 95 cm radially from the beam axis , comprising a 67-layer charged - particle tracking system which is immersed in a 1.5 tesla solenoidal magnetic field . the momentum @xmath81 , in gev , of charged particles is measured with a resolution of @xmath82^{\\frac{1}{2 } } \\approx 0.5\\%$ ] for the electrons we see in @xmath1 decay .",
    "in addition , ionization loss @xmath83 is measured in the 51-layer main drift chamber with a resolution of 6 - 7@xmath84 .    also important for the measurements reported here",
    "is an electromagnetic calorimeter consisting of 7800 thallium - doped csi crystals .",
    "these crystals , each of dimension @xmath85 5 cm @xmath86 5 cm @xmath86 30 cm , surround the tracking volume , convering 98@xmath84 of the full solid angle . forming the barrel region of the calorimeter ,",
    "6144 tapered crystals are arrayed just inside the magnet coil at a radius of @xmath85 1 m in a projective cylindrical geometry , covering 82@xmath84 of the solid angle .",
    "the remaining crystals are rectangular , and are oriented axially in two end caps , overlapping in solid angle with the ends of the barrel .",
    "the barrel region of the calorimeter achieves energy and angular resolutions for electromagnetically showering particles of @xmath87 and @xmath88mrad@xmath89 ( @xmath90 in gev ) , respectively .",
    "the resulting photon energy and direction information provided by this system is used to reconstruct @xmath64 decays to determine our @xmath1 sample size as described below .",
    "the crystals are also used in distinguishing electrons from pions . when combined with the tracking and @xmath91 information from the drift chambers , the misidentification of pions is limited to less than one percent .",
    "we used 3.11 fb@xmath92 of data at the @xmath93(4s ) resonance , 10.57 gev , and 1.69 fb@xmath92 of data below the @xmath93(4s ) resonance at 10.53 gev .",
    "the samples of on resonance and off resonance hadronic events were : @xmath94 @xmath95    we note that 75@xmath84 of the on resonance events are of the same type as the off resonance ( also called continuum ) events .",
    "the remaining 25@xmath84 of the on resonance events are from @xmath96 production .",
    "we found that a major source of contamination in the search for @xmath38 decay is one real electron from the semileptonic decay of the @xmath97 or @xmath98 plus one false electron from a pion from the @xmath98 or @xmath97 decay chain .",
    "we substantially reduce the number of @xmath99 events by applying the following selection criterion to the on resonance events .",
    "we require @xmath100 , where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the zeroth and second fox - wolfram moments , respectively  @xcite .",
    "this selectively removes almost all of the more spherically - shaped events ( see appendix a for clarification ) .",
    "thus when discussing our total sample size , we emphasize the number of continuum events in our data sample : @xmath103 @xmath104 note that this requirement also removes about fifty percent of the more collimated continuum events ; this effect is included in the efficiencies we determine below .",
    "we determined the number of @xmath1 mesons in the events in eqs .",
    "( [ data1 ] ) and  ( [ data2 ] ) using the following procedure .",
    "we selected pairs of photons from the decay @xmath105 we then used continuum @xmath106 hadron events generated from monte carlo  @xcite and our simulation of the properties of the cleo ii detector to determine the efficiency for detecting @xmath64 .",
    "we also calculated the average number of @xmath1 s produced per event .",
    "we now give the details of the procedure .      in developing the criteria for selecting photon pairs from @xmath107 we kept in mind that we would be looking for @xmath38 .",
    "as much as possible we chose the same selection criteria for @xmath108 pairs as we would use for the @xmath2 pairs . in this way any uncertainties in the monte carlo modeling of the events will be applied to both decays and thus cancel out of the analysis .",
    "for example , since a crucial identification signal for both @xmath108 s and @xmath70 s is an electromagnetic shower in the calorimeter , and since a minimum shower energy of 0.4 gev is required for precise @xmath109 separation , we set the minimum shower energy at 0.4 gev for @xmath108 s as well .",
    "only @xmath110 hadron events were used by requiring the following selection criteria .",
    "first , the events must have at least five charged tracks each of momentum greater than 225 mev / c .",
    "second , non - annihilation events such as those from beam - gas or beam - wall interactions were rejected .",
    "third , for events taken at beam energies corresponding to the @xmath111 resonance , @xmath99 events were removed by the @xmath112 cut described previously .",
    "further selection criteria for identifying @xmath108 s from @xmath113 were :    \\a .",
    "the electromagnetic shower must occur in the main ( barrel ) portion of the electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "specifically , @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the angle between the @xmath108 direction and the beam axis .",
    "the angle between the shower and the nearest charged particle track must be larger than @xmath116 .",
    "the shower energy must be larger than 0.4 gev .",
    "the pattern of energy deposition of the shower in the crystals must be characteristic of a single photon ( two or more clusters of deposited energy indicate randomly overlapping photons or a high - momentum @xmath117 ) .",
    "the shower must not appear to be a fragment from another shower or from a charged pion interaction .",
    "if two @xmath108 s have an invariant mass within @xmath118 ( 12.5 mev / c@xmath7 ) of the @xmath117 mass , both @xmath108 s were discarded .    using @xmath108 s selected with these six criteria we then considered all combinations of pairs subject to the condition that @xmath119 where * p@xmath120 * and * p@xmath121 * are the vector momenta of the two @xmath108 s .",
    "we set this condition to reduce the number of random pairings of @xmath108 s .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the invariant mass spectra for @xmath108 pairs for the on and off resonance data .",
    "the @xmath1 mass peaks at 546 mev / c@xmath7 have the widths expected from the properties of the cleo ii detector , namely @xmath122 mev / c@xmath7 .",
    "fits to these spectra gave the following number of observed @xmath64 decays : @xmath123 @xmath124 hence we observed about @xmath125 @xmath64 decays .      in determining the efficiency for detecting @xmath113 events we restricted ourselved to simulated @xmath106 hadron events in the continuum .",
    "using the selection criteria described in secs .",
    "iiia and iiib and the known number of @xmath1 s in our monte carlo sample , we calculated the efficiency for on resonance ( with the @xmath112 cut ) and off resonance ( without the @xmath112 cut ) . since from eqs",
    "( [ data1 ] ) and  ( [ data2 ] ) we see that @xmath126 of our events are off resonance and @xmath127 of our events are on resonance , we use these fractions to find a weighted mean efficiency for @xmath64 , @xmath128 where the error is statistical .",
    "the systematic error , which is substantially larger , will be discussed in sec . v. we also found good agreement between the observed @xmath64 events and the simulated @xmath64 events with respect to the @xmath1 momentum spectrum , the @xmath1 angular distribution , and the @xmath108 pair invariant mass distribution of both the @xmath1 peak and the background .",
    "one major reason for the small efficiency in eq .",
    "( [ gameff ] ) is that the @xmath1 momentum , @xmath129 , is required to be larger than 0.8 gev / c , but most @xmath1 s are produced at smaller momenta .",
    "also responsible for the small efficiency is the requirement that the @xmath108 shower energy in the calorimeter , @xmath130 , be greater than 0.4 gev .",
    "smaller lower limits on @xmath129 and @xmath130 would increase @xmath131 substantially , but would result in large increases in background for @xmath38 .",
    "as already noted we limited our systematic uncertainties , particularly our dependence on simulated event sets , by using as much as possible the same selection criteria for @xmath38 events as we used for the observed @xmath64 events , secs .",
    "iiib and iiic .",
    "beginning with the same event sample in eqs .",
    "( [ data1 ] ) and([data2 ] ) we again require five charged tracks , classification as an annihilation event , and @xmath132 for the on resonance events",
    ". we then looked for showers associated with a charged track which met the following criteria :    \\a .",
    "the shower angle @xmath115 must satisfy @xmath133 .",
    "the shower energy must be larger than 0.4 gev .",
    "the energy deposition of the shower in the crystals must be characteristic of a single photon .",
    "the shower must not appear to be a fragment from another shower or from a charged pion interaction .",
    "we require @xmath134*p@xmath120*@xmath135*p@xmath121*@xmath136 gev / c .",
    "the charged particle track had to satisfy our standard criteria for a track from the primary interaction vertex , namely :    \\f .",
    "the track had to be of good quality , as identified by the cleo software tracking algorithms .",
    "the distance of closest approach of the track to the beam line had to be less than 5 mm .",
    "the distance of closest approach of the track to the event vertex measured parallel to the beam line had to be less than 50 mm .",
    "next the track had to be identified as an electron using a standard cleo algorithm combining @xmath137 , shower shape , and several other parameters .",
    "the algorithm has an efficiency of greater than @xmath3 , with the exact efficiency depending on * p@xmath138 * , and a fake rate from charged pions of about @xmath139 .",
    "we then calculated the invariant mass of every @xmath2 combination in the events of eqs .",
    "( [ data1 ] ) and  ( [ data2 ] ) .",
    "figure[fig3 ] shows the spectrum in the mass range of 0.5 to 0.6 gev / c@xmath7 .",
    "there is no peak at the @xmath1 mass of 547 mev / c@xmath7 .",
    "a study of simulated @xmath38 decays showed that a peak would have a @xmath140 of about 5 mev / c@xmath7 .",
    "to determine the upper limit on the branching fraction @xmath141 we have to know the efficiency for the detection of @xmath38 decays using the criteria in sec .",
    "we generated simulated @xmath38 decays , applied these criteria and found the total efficiency by taking a weighted mean of on resonance and off resonance data as in sec .",
    "the mean efficiency was found to be @xmath142 where the error is statistical .",
    "we used the same simulated events to parameterize the shape of a hypothetical @xmath38 peak , resulting in a mass of @xmath143 mev / c@xmath7 and a width @xmath144 of @xmath145 mev / c@xmath7 , where the errors are statistical .",
    "this shape was then used to fit the data of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] to find a @xmath3 confidence upper limit on the number of @xmath38 decays , @xmath146 .",
    "varying the mean and @xmath140 of the fit by one standard deviation , and alternately applying linear and quadratic background functions , gave a range of values for @xmath146 from 18.4 to 27.1 events .",
    "we used the most conservative of these fits and concluded @xmath147    it is at this point that we must consider the major sources of systematic error in our analysis . as we have already minimized the uncertainty from the electromagnetic calorimeter selection criteria , our remaining sources of systematic error stem from our tracking , particle idenfication , and photon detection efficiencies , as well as the uncertainties in @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 , and @xmath151 .",
    "the total systematic uncertainty of @xmath152 is calculated in table  [ t2 ] . in our final calculation",
    "we reduce our mean efficiency by this amount , yielding : @xmath153    finally , we normalize to the branching fraction of @xmath154 , @xmath155 and arrive at our @xmath3 confidence upper limit , @xmath156 this upper limit is indicated by the dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    ".summary of systematic uncertainty [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      our limit of @xmath37 agrees with and improves upon the upper limit of @xmath157 found by white _",

    "_ used the reaction @xmath158he@xmath159 to produce @xmath1 s combined with a two - arm counter telescope to search for the @xmath38 decay .",
    "in the course of concluding our analysis we have considered if improvements could be made in our method .",
    "we note from eqs .",
    "( [ data3 ] ) and  ( [ data4 ] ) that about @xmath160 @xmath64 events were observed . since @xmath161 and @xmath162 are about the same , we should have been able to investigate a @xmath39 of the order @xmath163 if there were no background events . in the future",
    "when the number of detected @xmath110 hadron events increase twofold or more at cesr , and at the b - factories now under construction , one might hope to achieve a sensitivity of @xmath164 .",
    "however there is a background primarily from pairs containing one true electron and one pion misidentified as an electron . removing @xmath99 decays aided us somewhat , but unless this background is further reduced , sensitivities of @xmath165 to @xmath164 for @xmath39 can not be achieved by our method . the rich detector that will be installed for cleo iii should help improve the pion - electron separation . in addition , substantial improvement in sensitivity",
    "will probably be achieved using fixed target @xmath1 production via hadronic collisions and specially designed electronic detectors .",
