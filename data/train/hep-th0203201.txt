    "if string theory provides us with a quantum theory of gravity , it is natural to study the propagation of strings in time dependent backgrounds .",
    "some of the easiest models one can think of are constructed as lorentzian orbifolds of minkowski spacetime .",
    "these have recently received considerable attention  @xcite .",
    "see also  @xcite for related work .",
    "the purpose of this work is to analyse the geometry of minkowski spacetime modded out by a null rotation , what one may call null orbifold .",
    "one can look at this quotient space as some intermediate case between modding out by a rotation and modding out by a boost , which is still singular , but preserves one half of the spacetime supersymmetries .",
    "this set up was already considered in  @xcite , and also in the context of twisting the n=2 string  @xcite .",
    "the first , and original , motivation for the present work was provided by the cosmological scenario presented in  @xcite .",
    "they found a classical solution to einstein equations coupled to a single scalar field subject to no potential with two branches . the first branch ( @xmath0 ) describes a contracting universe , whereas the second one ( @xmath1 ) , an expanding universe .",
    "they are connected through a singularity at @xmath2 , where the planck scale vanishes and the general relativity description breaks down . when embedded in string theory , the limit @xmath3 corresponds to a weak coupling regime , and the vanishing of the planck scale tells us that higher dimensional operators become important as @xmath3 .",
    "thus , a perturbative worldsheet description is appropiate and reliable near the singularity .",
    "a fascinating remark was also given in  @xcite in order to deal with such a worldsheet description .",
    "it was stated there that the d - dimensional configuration could be understood as simply @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the two dimensional milne universe .",
    "the fact that @xmath5 can be understood as the quotient of the interior of the past and future light cones by the action of the group @xmath6 generated by a boost suggests that the two dimensional worldsheet field theory might be that of a lorentzian orbifold of minkowski spacetime .",
    "this possibility has been recently studied in  @xcite . in  @xcite , a possible resolution of the lorentzian orbifold by adding a transverse compact spacelike circle was also considered .    motivated by the above construction , we shall look for a spacetime geometry that can be thought of minkowski spacetime modded out by the action of some vector field acting non - trivially on time , such that the quotient manifold remains supersymmetric ( modding out by a boost breaks supersymmetry completely ) and has no closed timelike curves ( ctcs ) .",
    "it turns out such a spacetime geometry is unique or adding further transverse rotations to @xmath7 are not considered in this paper . ]",
    ": it corresponds to minkowski spacetime in three dimensions modded out by a null rotation . a null rotation in the @xmath8 direction is infinitesimally generated by the killing vector    @xmath9    so that it consists of a boost in the @xmath8 direction plus a rotation in the 12-plane such that both the rapidity of the boost and the angle of the rotation have the same norm .",
    "thus , as stressed before , this is a particular modding in the family parametrised by @xmath10 . whenever @xmath11 , there always exists a lorentz transformation such that @xmath12 , whereas when @xmath13 , this freedom under conjugations allows us to write @xmath14 .",
    "the norm of the killing vector @xmath7 vanishes at @xmath15 , where our quotient manifold is even not hausdorff , due to the existence of fixed points @xmath16 . for @xmath17",
    ", the spacetime looks like a strip of length proportional to @xmath18 with boundaries satisfying non - trivial identification conditions .",
    "this geometry and the absence of ctcs are discussed in section 2 .",
    "notice that the existence of a covariantly constant null vector in this spacetime does not allow us to view the singularity at @xmath15 as formed to the future of a non - singular surface .",
    "in that respect , it looks closer to a singular wave solution  @xcite .",
    "the fact that our modding involves both boosts and rotations raises the question whether the above spacetime geometry is related , in some way , with the btz black hole  @xcite .",
    "this is discussed in section 3 , where it is shown that under a double scaling limit , the btz geometry reduces to the null rotation geometry .    the second motivation for this work was to understand the geometry behind the nullbrane solution found in  @xcite .",
    "nullbranes were obtained by kaluza - klein reduction along the orbits of the killing vector @xmath19 where @xmath20 stands for a compact transverse spacelike coordinate of length @xmath21 . since @xmath22 everywhere and it has no fixed points , such a spacetime modding constitutes one possible way of resolving the singularity found in the null rotation geometry .",
    "it is indeed proved that such spacetime has no closed causal curves .",
    "this is discussed in section 4 , where we also include the singular ten dimensional configuration , the so called dilatonic wave , whose uplift to eleven dimensions can be interpreted as the null rotation geometry .",
    "some comments concerning the duality relations among nullbranes and dilatonic waves are also considered .",
    "we conclude with some extensions of the construction presented in this paper to curved backgrounds , trying to emphasize the universality of this new sector in string theory .    * note added .",
    "* when this work was being completed , we learnt of some work in progress  @xcite in which the same model is analysed .",
    "given a minkowskian spacetime in @xmath23 dimensions , any one parameter subgroup generated by a killing vector @xmath24 acting on this space @xmath25 defines a quotient space by identifying points along its orbit . in the present case",
    ", @xmath24 can be decomposed as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a translation and @xmath28 is a lorentz transformation . by conjugating with a lorentz transformation one can bring @xmath29 to a normal form .",
    "since we are just interested in one parameter subgroups acting non - trivially on time , one is left with two possiblities    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is an infinitesimal boost with parameter @xmath32 along direction @xmath33 , @xmath34 is a null rotation with parameter @xmath35 in the direction 1 and @xmath21 stands for rotations . in the following",
    ", we shall not consider the possibility of rotating in the transverse directions @xmath36 .",
    "preservation of supersymmetry excludes boosts and selects null rotations .",
    "this can be easily proved by studying how killing vectors @xmath24 act on killing spinors @xmath37 through the spinorial lie derivative  @xcite @xmath38}\\gamma^{ab}\\varepsilon~.\\ ] ]    there is a second possibility for acting non - trivially on time while preserving full supersymmetry , which is by considering a time translation , @xmath39 , but since we are not willing to consider compact time directions , we shall concentrate on null rotation identifications , which preserve one half of the supersymmetries .",
    "one way to describe the geometry of the null rotation identifications is by fibering the original spacetime with the orbits of the associated killing vector and studying the effects of the identifications in this adapted coordinate system .",
    "the orbits are given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 are initial conditions , @xmath42 is the affine parameter of the orbit and @xmath43 are lightlike coordinates .",
    "notice that the line located at @xmath44 is a line of fixed points .",
    "there are two reasons why to study sections of spacetime with constant @xmath45 .",
    "first of all , @xmath7 does not act on @xmath45 .",
    "furthermore , the norm of the killing vector , @xmath46 , teaches us to consider either @xmath17 or @xmath15 .",
    "this is precisely what we shall do next .",
    "let us start on the region where @xmath17 .",
    "the plane spanned by @xmath47 is fibered by @xmath48 , since as we vary @xmath49 and move along the fiber @xmath50 one covers the full subspace .",
    "we are interested in the geometry of spacetime when non - trivial identifications are set along the orbits , that is @xmath51 for some dimensionless parameter @xmath52 .",
    "the first consequence of such an identification is that spacetime becomes a strip of length @xmath53 along the @xmath8 direction .",
    "we shall use the freedom to locate the strip to set @xmath54 to zero .",
    "the @xmath55 direction remains a non - compact one , but due to the parabolic nature of @xmath56 , the boundaries of the forementioned strip satisfy non - trivial identification conditions . indeed , the point @xmath57 is identified with @xmath58 @xmath59 this geometry is illustrated in figures  [ geometry1 ] and  [ geometry2 ] for @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively .    as @xmath18 decreases , the paraboles start degenerating and the strip shrinks . in fact , the limit @xmath62 is singular , as can be seen from different points of view .",
    "first of all , the space at @xmath15 is not haussdorf , due to the existence of fixed points .",
    "its fibering is no longer given in terms of @xmath48 , but in terms of @xmath63 .",
    "this can be easily derived from the orbits .",
    "indeed , @xmath8 is left invariant at @xmath15 , thus it remains non - compact in that subspace . on the other hand ,",
    "the previous paraboles degenerate into a line of fixed points located at @xmath64 . away from @xmath64 ,",
    "one is left with @xmath65 where points @xmath66 are identified with points @xmath67 @xmath68 the geometry of the @xmath15 subspace is illustrated in figure  [ geometry3 ] .",
    "one is thus left with two regions of spacetime ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) connected through @xmath15 , where the quotient space is not even a haussdorf space . in the next subsection",
    ", we shall analytically prove the existence of closed null curves .",
    "these can easily be guessed by looking at figure  [ geometry3 ] and considering the null curves ( dashed line on the figure ) ,    @xmath69 connecting points p and q which are identified by the action of the @xmath70 subgroup generated by @xmath7 .",
    "thus , at @xmath15 , spacetime has also causal singularities .    at this stage",
    ", one can just remove @xmath15 from spacetime , leaving two disconnected regions with no causal singularities .",
    "a more sensible possibility is to embed such scenario in string theory and analyse whether the twisted sectors located at @xmath15 manage to resolve such singularity .",
    "a further possibility to smooth it is to modify the action of the @xmath70 subgroup by adding a transverse compact spacelike direction @xmath71 we postpone the discussion of such a resolution until we embed this geometry in string theory in section 4 .",
    "a necessary condition for the absence of closed causal curves in quotient spaces of the type discussed above is that the norm of the killing vector generating the @xmath70 subgroup action is strictly positive .",
    "such a property is not satisfied by @xmath7 , thus closed null curves are expected at @xmath15 , as already stressed before .",
    "the question we would like to address is the non - existence of closed causal curves for @xmath17 .",
    "this is non - trivial , because the forementioned criterium is not a sufficient condition .",
    "the proof uses an adapted coordinate system @xmath72 to the action of @xmath7 ( @xmath73 ) which is valid for @xmath17 , the subspace we are interested in .",
    "this coordinate system is defined by @xmath74 in which the three dimensional metric can be written as    @xmath75    we want to show there is no causal curve @xmath76 , i.e. @xmath77 @xmath78 , connecting the points @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "if we assume that such a curve exists , there must necessarily exist one value of the affine parameter @xmath81 where @xmath82 vanishes @xmath83 the norm of the tangent vector to @xmath76 at @xmath84 is @xmath85 such an inequality can never be satisfied for a timelike curve , so no closed timelike curves exist .",
    "on the other hand , the norm vanishes when    @xmath86    since we are away from @xmath87 .",
    "thus , at @xmath84 , the tangent vector to the causal curve vanishes identically , which contradicts @xmath29 being an affine parameter .",
    "we conclude that closed causal curves are not allowed when @xmath88 .",
    "the btz black hole line element  @xcite is given by @xmath89 ^ 2 ~ ,   \\label{btz}\\ ] ] the lapse function being defined by @xmath90 where m and j are two constants of integration which are identified as the mass and angular momentum .",
    "this is a solution to einstein field equations in three dimensions with negative cosmological constant @xmath91 related to the radius of curvature through @xmath92 .",
    "the lapse function vanishes for two values of @xmath93 given by @xmath94^{1/2}\\right\\}\\right]^{1/2 } ~ ,   \\label{horizon}\\ ] ] whereas @xmath95 vanishes at @xmath96 these three special values of @xmath93 obey @xmath97 as it happens in 3 + 1 dimensions for the kerr metric , @xmath98 is the black hole horizon , @xmath99 is the surface of infinite redshift , and the region between @xmath98 and @xmath99 is the ergosphere .",
    "the solution describes a black hole whenever @xmath100    besides the continuous black hole spectrum above the vacuum ( m = j=0 ) , there is a sort of `` bound state '' space separated from the vacuum by a mass gap of one unit ( m=-1 and j=0 ) , which can not be continuously deformed to the vacuum and has neither singularities nor horizon .",
    "this is anti - de sitter space , which can be defined in terms of its embedding in a four - dimensional flat space of signature @xmath101 @xmath102 through the equation @xmath103 a system of coordinates covering the whole manifold may be introduced by setting @xmath104 which yields @xmath105 ~.   \\label{adsmetric}\\ ] ] notice that strictly speaking , by an abuse of language , one refers to anti - de sitter space to its universal covering space , the one in which the angular coordinate @xmath29 has been `` unwrapped '' , to avoid the existence of closed timelike curves ( ctcs ) .    by construction ,",
    "the anti - de sitter metric is invariant under @xmath106 .",
    "the killing vectors generating @xmath107 are explicitly given below for later reference @xmath108    it was shown in  @xcite that can be obtained by making identifications along the orbits generated by the killing vector @xmath109 the latter contains boosts and rotations , so it is rather natural to ask whether there is some relation between the null rotation identification space and the btz black hole .",
    "it will be proved that the former appears as a double scaling limit of the latter .    just by looking at the construction of both spaces , the strategy of the proof",
    "emerges naturally .",
    "both spaces are constructed by modding out an starting spacetime by the action of a certain one dimensional subgroup generated by a given killing vector .",
    "thus , if one establishes a precise map between the starting configurations and the killing vectors used in the modding , the relation among both quotient spaces will have been established .",
    "the starting configurations are maximally symmetric spaces of vanishing and negative cosmological constant , respectively .",
    "it is thus a necessary condition , but not sufficient , to study the limit @xmath110 , in which one is just left with the inside of the black hole ( the exterior is pushed away to infinity ) .",
    "if one further concentrates on a region pretty close to the origin of spacetime by considering the double scaling limit @xmath111 it is easy to check that the anti - de sitter metric is mapped into the minkowski metric and the lie algebra @xmath107 contracts to @xmath112 .",
    "notice that the radial coordinate @xmath113 in the btz black hole metric does not scale in the limit .",
    "this means that if @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) , in the limit @xmath116 @xmath117 thus , the double scaling limit relating both maximally symmetric spaces enforces the mass and angular momentum to vanish , keeping @xmath118 fixed .",
    "since the black hole interpretation disappears , @xmath98 no longer corresponds to a horizon .",
    "when one analyses the killing vector in the double scaling limit and , it reduces to @xmath119 which is equivalent to the one used in the null rotation construction .",
    "indeed , just by a orientation reversal discrete transformation @xmath120 and by a change of origin ( conjugation under translations ) @xmath121",
    "it is straightforward to embed the previous three dimensional geometry in string theory and m - theory .",
    "one just needs to consider the maximally supersymmetric flat vacua of these theories and construct the quotient space by identifying points along the orbit of @xmath7 . as discussed in section 2",
    ", such a quotient spacetime will be supersymmetric . in this section",
    ", we shall concentrate on this construction for m - theory and type iia string theory , even though it can just as well be applied to type iib .",
    "we shall first look for some ten dimensional singular spacetime , whose uplift to m - theory can be interpreted as the corresponding scenario described in section 2 when embedded in m - theory .",
    "afterwards , we shall comment on a possible resolution of the singularity by adding an extra compact spacelike dimension transverse to the action of the null rotation .",
    "it will be proved that the corresponding quotient spacetime has no closed causal curves , and that the corresponding ten dimensional geometry is the nullbrane supersymmetric configuration found in  @xcite . some comments on duality relations among these spacetimes will be added .",
    "we conclude with some brief discussion concerning generalizations of the previous constructions to arbitrary curved backgrounds having an @xmath122 isometry subgroup .      as reviewed in the introduction , one of the features of the cosmological scenario discussed in  @xcite was its higher dimensional interpretation in terms of flat space modded out by a boost . in the same spirit , one may look for a singular spacetime whose singularity might be interpreted as the one discussed in section 2 .",
    "it is natural to change coordinates from the cartesian ones @xmath123 to the adapted ones @xmath124 @xmath125 where @xmath126 stands for the compact coordinate along the orbit . in this coordinate system ,",
    "the metric for the three dimensional subspace of spacetime where @xmath122 acts , is written as  @xcite @xmath127 the killing vector @xmath7 becomes @xmath128 in the above coordinate system and its norm vanishes at @xmath129 .",
    "if one analyses the kaluza - klein reduction of the eleven dimensional minkowski spacetime along the orbits of @xmath7 , one expects a ten dimensional configuration becoming singular precisely where the causal singularity was located in m - theory . proceeding in this way",
    ", one derives a @xmath130-supersymmetric type iia configuration : @xmath131 where we used cartesian coordinates @xmath132 instead of the lightlike ones @xmath133 .",
    "notice that the conformal factor @xmath134 does not disappear in the einstein frame , where the metric is given by @xmath135 on the other hand , the energy - momentum tensor has the same form as the one for an electromagnetic field @xmath136 .",
    "indeed , the one form @xmath137 equals @xmath138 , and since the latter defines a null one form , the second contribution to the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath139 , vanishes .",
    "thus , @xmath140 vanishes except for the components on the t - x plane @xmath141 thus , as expected , the ten dimensional geometry has an essential singularity on @xmath87 , the lightlike hypersurface where the norm of the killing vector used in the reduction vanishes .",
    "notice that even though the scalar curvature vanishes , both the riemann and energy - momentum tensors diverge on the singularity .",
    "one way of resolving the causal singularity that appears when modding out spacetime by a null rotation is to add a compact spacelike transverse direction in the action of the @xmath70 subgroup used to identify points . in other words ,",
    "one adds a transverse translation @xmath142 to the null rotation killing vector @xmath143 and mods out spacetime by the action of @xmath144 such a killing vector has an strictly positive norm , thus suggesting the absence of closed causal curves .",
    "furthermore , the presence of @xmath145 removes all previous fixed points left invariant by the action of @xmath146 . to sum up",
    ", one expects a non - singular @xmath130- supersymmetric spacetime , since translations do not modify the supersymmetry analysis presented before .    by analysing the orbits of @xmath24 , it is straightforward to figure out the geometry of the quotient spacetime . in figure",
    "[ nullbranefig ] , it is explicitly shown how the previous causal singularity at @xmath15 is resolved by the translation @xmath145 .    in order to prove that there are no closed causal curves in the quotient spacetime ,",
    "it is useful to work in adapted coordinates . these were found in  @xcite . here",
    ", we just write the eleven dimensional metric in such a coordinate system :    @xmath147    where @xmath148 and @xmath20 stands for the compact transverse spacelike direction @xmath149 .",
    "what we want to prove is that there is no causal curve @xmath76 , i.e. @xmath150 @xmath151 , connecting the points @xmath152 and @xmath153 , because if so , that would give rise to a closed curve in the quotient spacetime .",
    "the basic step of the proof is , once more , to realise that for such a curve to exist , there must be some value of the affine parameter @xmath29 where the component of the tangent vector @xmath154 vanishes .",
    "mathematically , @xmath155 if one evaluates the norm of the tangent vector to the _ assumed _ closed causal curve at @xmath84 @xmath156 one appreciates that it is positive or zero , so one concludes there are certainly no closed timelike curves .",
    "furthermore , the lower bound of the norm is saturated if and only if @xmath157 but such a possibility is excluded because @xmath29 is an affine parameter .",
    "thus , closed null curves are also absent in this quotient spacetime .",
    "having resolved the singularity , we also conclude that the nullbrane configuration discovered in  @xcite is the ten dimensional configuration resolving the singularity of the dilatonic wave at @xmath129 .",
    "we would like to finish this subsection with some remarks concerning the _ local _ relation among the different configurations discussed so far . as emphasized in  @xcite , any m - theory background with various identifications",
    "defines a moduli space of kaluza - klein reductions .",
    "each point @xmath158 in this moduli corresponds to a type iia configuration obtained by reduction along the orbits of a killing vector field @xmath159 .",
    "the freedom in choosing @xmath159 is equivalent to the freedom in identifying the different circles in this background as the m - theory circle .",
    "different type iia configurations obtained in this way will all be u - dual to each other . in the case at hand , our starting m - theory configuration is minkowski spacetime with two different identifications [ m - vacuum ( a , b ) in figure  [ dualityfig ] ] : along the @xmath160 circle , generated by @xmath161 , and along the null rotation , generated by @xmath7 .",
    "there are three different circles ( killing vector fields ) that one can identify with the m - theory circle :    @xmath162    reduction along the orbits generated by @xmath163 [ r(a ) in figure  [ dualityfig ] ] gives rise to minkowski spacetime modded out by a null rotation [ iia - vacuum ( b ) in figure  [ dualityfig ] ] . on the other hand , @xmath164 [ r(b ) ] gives rise to a dilatonic wave with a transverse circle [ dilatonic wave ( a ) ] and @xmath165 [ r(a , b ) ] to the nullbrane configuration .",
    "all of them are connected to each other through the chain of dualities @xmath166 , where @xmath167 stands for t - duality and @xmath168 for an @xmath169 transformation in type iib , reminiscent of the @xmath169 symmetry of the torus spanned by @xmath170 .",
