    "one can show that @xmath2 can also be described as a _ penetration spectrum _ for the geodesic flow on the ( unit tangent bundle of the ) modular surface @xmath13 in the following way .",
    "let @xmath14 be the hyperbolic height function on the modular surface .",
    "if @xmath15 is any hyperbolic geodesic on @xmath13 which has @xmath5 as forward endpoint and which is contained in a compact , the value @xmath16 is related to the asymptotic depth of penetration of the geodesic @xmath17 into the cusp of the modular surface , given by the quantity : @xmath18    the structure of @xmath2 has been studied for more than a century . among the wide literature , we mention the very good introduction in @xcite , where it is proved that @xmath2 is a closed subset of the real line and that the values @xmath16 for @xmath7 quadratic irrational form a dense subset .",
    "m. hall in 1947 ( see @xcite ) established that @xmath19 contains a positive half - line , also known as _ hall s ray_. the lower part of @xmath2 , that is the window @xmath20\\cap{{\\mathcal{l }   } } $ ] , is a discrete sequence of quadratic irrational numbers cumulating to @xmath21 , as proved by markoff in 1879 .",
    "the minimum of @xmath2 , that is @xmath22 , is known as _",
    "hurwitz s constant_. the geometric picture corresponding to the discrete part of @xmath2 was described in @xcite . a fine result on the hausdorff dimension of @xmath2 in the region between the discrete part and the hall ray",
    "is proved more recently by @xcite .",
    "a great variety of generalizations of lagrange spectra has been defined and studied , mostly related to geodesic flows in negative curvature , in particular by paulin - parkkonen ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we do no attempt to resume the literature on the subject and we refer to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for a complete bibliography .",
    "the study of generalizations of the lagrange spectrum has seen a very recent surge of interest , see for example the recent work by ibarra and moreira on lagrange spectra for the geodesic flow on surfaces with variable negative curvature @xcite and in particular the various recent works @xcite on lagrange spectra of translation surfaces , which are also the object of study of the present paper .",
    "a generalization of lagrange spectra in the context of _ translation surfaces _ was recently introduced by hubert , marchese and ulcigrai in  @xcite .",
    "_ translation surfaces _ are surfaces obtained by glueing a finite set of polygons in the plane , by identifying pairs of isometric parallel sides by translations ( see the next subsection definitions ) , so that one gets a surface which carries a flat metric with conical singularities .",
    "the _ moduli space _ of translation surfaces consists of translation surfaces up to the equivalence relation obtained by cutting and pasting by parallel translations .",
    "a natural _ action of @xmath23 _ ( the group of @xmath24 by @xmath24 matrices with real entries and determinant one ) on the moduli space of translation surfaces is induced by the linear action of matrices on polygons in the plane ( see the next subsection ) .    more precisely , in @xcite , lagrange spectra are associated to any _ locus _ of translation surfaces in their moduli space which is closed and invariant under the @xmath23 action .",
    "examples of @xmath23-invariant loci are _ strata _ , i.e. loci formed by all translation surfaces with a prescribed type of conical singularities and _ teichmueller curves _ ,",
    "i.e. ( unit tangent bundles of ) hyperbolic surfaces which are closed @xmath23 orbits .",
    "the translation surfaces whose @xmath0 orbit is a _ teichmueller curve _ are known as _ veech _ ( or _ lattice _ ) _ surfaces _ and are rich in affine symmetries .",
    "the simplest example of a veech surface is the square torus ( whose @xmath0 orbit is the modular surface , for which the lagrange spectrum defined in @xcite reduces to the classical case ) and their covers , _ square tiled surfaces _ ( see below for the definition ) .",
    "it was shown that lagrange spectra of closed invariant loci of translation surfaces share several of the same qualitative properties with @xmath2 .",
    "for example , it is proved already in @xcite that each of these generalized lagrange spectra is closed and equal to the closure of a set of values which generalize quadratic irrationals ( see after definition [ deflspectrum ] ) .",
    "in @xcite it is proved that @xmath19 contains a positive half - line , also called _ hall s ray _ , for all those @xmath25 containing a _ veech surface _ @xmath26 ( see also theorem 1.6 of @xcite , where the same result was proved for loci which contain a square - tiled surface ) .",
    "recently , m. boshernitzan and v. delecroix computed the minimum of the lagrange spectrum of a connected component of a stratum of translation surfaces ( whose value is given in the next subsection after definition [ deflspectrum ] ) and showed that it is an isolated point ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study an explicit simple case of lagrange spectrum in the context of translation surfaces , for which we can provide a very fine analysis which displays interesting phenomena which makes it different than the classical and general case ( see below ) .",
    "we consider _ square - tiled surfaces _ , that is translation surfaces tiled by copies of the square @xmath27 ^ 2 $ ] , which as reminded earlier have a particularly simple @xmath0 orbit closures in strata of translation surfaces : any orbit @xmath28 of a square tiled surface @xmath26 is closed in its stratum .",
    "one can associate to the orbit closure a lagrange spectrum ( see the definition [ deflvalues ] and [ deflspectrum ] below ) , which will denote by @xmath29 ( where @xmath30 if @xmath26 and @xmath31 have the same orbit closure ) .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that one can study the lagrange spectrum of square - tiled surfaces by using renormalization and continued fractions .",
    "in particular , a formula for _ high _ values in the lagrange spectrum using continued fraction was proved ( see lemma [ lem : lem5.10hubertmarcheseulcigrai ] in @xcite ) .",
    "one can see that if @xmath26 is any square - tiled surface whose number of squares is at most @xmath32 , then @xmath29 is an affine copy of the classical lagrange spectrum @xmath33 .",
    "this paper is devoted to the study of the lagrange spectrum @xmath29 arising for a square tiled surace @xmath26 consisting of @xmath34 squares ( in the so - called _",
    "orbit b7 _ in the stratum @xmath1 , see below ) .",
    "as explained in the next subsection ( see also remark [ remwhywechoseorbitb ] ) , the @xmath35 orbit closure of this surface is one of the simplest orbit closures whose study is both non - trivial and accessible by renormalization techniques . in particular , one can show that the formula using continued fraction and renormalization allows to compute _ all _ values in the lagrange spectrum of this translation surface ( see theorem [ thm : renormalizedformula ] and remark [ remwhywechoseorbitb ] ) , while it is not clear if this is the case for an arbitrary number of squares .",
    "our main result ( theorem [ theoremmaintheorem ] in the next section ) describes the initial structure of the lagrange spectrum @xmath29 of this square - tiled surface .",
    "we compute in particular the smallest value @xmath36 of @xmath29 and prove that it is isolated , while we show that the second smallest value @xmath37 is not isolated .",
    "in particular , this shows that @xmath29 provides an example of a lagrange spectrum whose lower part is richer than in the classical case and for which the minimum @xmath36 is different than the minimum of the corresponding connected component computed by m. boshernitzan and v. delecroix in @xcite .",
    "moreover , our analysis provide further information on the intricate structure of the bottom part of @xmath29 , i.e. we can describe two countable families of accumulation points above @xmath37 which seems to indicate that any interval with left endpoint in @xmath37 intersects @xmath29 in a cantor set with positive hausdorff dimension bounded from below ( see the open questions [ q1 ] and [ q2 ] below )",
    ". the precise statement of our main results is given in theorem [ theoremmaintheorem ] below .",
    "our methods are a generalization of the methods used by cusick and flahive to analyze the discrete part of the classical lagrange spectrum ( see   1 of @xcite .",
    "we crucially exploit the renormalization formula for values in the spectrum ( see theorem [ thm : renormalizedformula ] and corollary [ cor : renormalizedformulafororbitb7 ] ) . as in the classical case ,",
    "the formula is based on continued fractions , but in our setup also involves renormalized values of the _ multiplicity _ , i.e. a geometric quantity associated to the @xmath38 orbit of the square - tiled surface . by analyzing the structure of this orbit , which can be encoded in a graph ,",
    "we show that to study the bottom of the spectrum it is sufficient to focus only on a smaller and simpler subgraph .",
    "essentially , this allows to reduce the study of the lagrange spectrum to the analysis of a limsup function over a subshift of finite type ( see theorem [ theoremreductiontosubshift ] ) .",
    "we believe that this type of framework has the potential to be applied in much greater generality in the study of other lagrange spectra and that our present analysis , in addition to its intrinsic interest , can also provide a paradigm for future works .      a _ translation surface _ is a genus @xmath39 closed surface @xmath26 with a flat metric and a finite set @xmath40 of conical singularities @xmath41 , the angle at each @xmath42 being an integer multiple of @xmath43 .",
    "an equivalent definition of translation surface @xmath26 is the datum @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is a compact riemann surface and @xmath46 is an holomorphic 1-form on @xmath45 having a zero at each @xmath42 .",
    "the relation @xmath47 holds , where @xmath48 are the orders of the zeroes of @xmath46 .",
    "the 1-form @xmath46 induces a non - zero area form @xmath49 on @xmath26 and we fix a normalization on translation surfaces requiring @xmath50 .",
    "a stratum @xmath51 is the set of translation surfaces @xmath26 whose corresponding holomorphic 1-form @xmath46 has @xmath52 zeros with orders @xmath48 , where @xmath47 .",
    "any stratum admits an action of @xmath0 , indeed for a translation surface @xmath53 and an element @xmath54 a new translation surface @xmath55 is defined , where the 1-form @xmath56 is the composition of @xmath46 with @xmath57 and @xmath58 is the complex atlas for which @xmath56 is holomorphic . in the following",
    "we mostly consider the action of the geodesic flow @xmath59 and the group of rotations @xmath60 , defined respectively for @xmath61 and @xmath62 by @xmath63 for a general overview on translation surfaces we recommend the surveys @xcite and @xcite .    a _ saddle connection _ for the translation surface @xmath26 is a geodesic @xmath64 for the flat metric connecting two conical singularities and not containing points of @xmath40 in its interior .",
    "the set @xmath65 of _ periods _ of @xmath66 is the set of complex numbers @xmath67 , where @xmath64 is a saddle connection for @xmath26 and @xmath46 is the holomorphic 1-form .",
    "the systole function @xmath68 is defined by @xmath69 strata are non compact .",
    "an exhaustion by compact subsets is the family @xmath70 , where for any @xmath71 we define @xmath72 as the set of those @xmath26 such that @xmath73 .",
    "therefore the positive @xmath59-orbit of a translation surface @xmath26 stays in a compact if @xmath74 for some constant @xmath71 and any @xmath75 .",
    "it is known from vorobets , and reproved in proposition 1.1 of @xcite , that @xmath76 where the @xmath77 in the middle term is taken over all periods @xmath78 .",
    "therefore the quantity @xmath79 defined above gives a measure of the size of the asymptotical maximal excursion of the positive @xmath59-orbit of @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath25 be an orbit closure for the action of @xmath0 in some stratum .",
    "the associated _ lagrange spectrum _ is the set of values @xmath80 according to theorem 1.5 of @xcite , any @xmath19 is a closed subset of the real line , equal to the closure of the set of values @xmath79 for those @xmath81 whose geodesic @xmath82 is periodic .",
    "m. boshernitzan and v. delecroix proved in @xcite that if @xmath25 is a connected component of any stratum @xmath83 , then the minimum of @xmath19 is @xmath84 and is isolated .",
    "in this paper we consider _ square - tiled surfaces _",
    "@xmath26 , also said _ origamis _ , that is translation surfaces @xmath26 tiled by copies of the square @xmath27 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "equivalently , @xmath26 is square - tiled if there exists a ramified covering @xmath85 , unramified outside @xmath86 and such that @xmath87 is the holomorphic 1-form of @xmath26 .",
    "square tiled surfaces are examples of veech surfaces and any @xmath0 orbit @xmath28 of a square - tiled surface @xmath26 is closed in its stratum . for simplicity",
    "we denote its lagrange spectrum by @xmath29 instead of @xmath88 , where of course @xmath30 if @xmath26 and @xmath31 have the same orbit closure .",
    "observe that it is implicit in our definition that the vertical and the horizontal directions on @xmath26 are rational directions .",
    "consider any other direction and let @xmath89 be the angle it forms with the vertical , then set @xmath90 .",
    "at page 187 of @xcite it is explained that @xmath29 is parametrized by the function @xmath91 defined by @xmath92    it is an easy exercise to prove that for @xmath93 we have @xmath94 which is the function giving rise to the classical lagrange spectrum @xmath2 , that is the set of values @xmath95 for @xmath7 badly approximable .",
    "this paper is devoted to the study of the lagrange spectrum @xmath29 arising for an origami @xmath26 in the so - called _",
    "orbit b7 _ in the stratum @xmath1 .",
    "observe first that the action of @xmath0 induces an action of @xmath96 , and the latter preserves the set of origamis with a given number @xmath97 of squares .",
    "for the stratum @xmath1 the orbits of such action have been classified in @xcite and @xcite , proving that there are always at most two orbits .",
    "the orbit b7 is described explicitly in   [ sec : descriptionoforbitb7 ] and essential details on the classification for @xmath1 are resumed in   [ sec : action - sltwoz - primitive - origamis ] .",
    "the interest in studying the orbit b7 can be seen from figure [ fig : surfaces ] : it contains origamis @xmath98 such that any horizontal saddle connection of @xmath98 is winded at least twice on the horizontal closed geodesic of @xmath99 under the covering map @xmath100 .",
    "one can see that if @xmath101 is an orbit where such property is not satisfied , like for example when the number of squares is at most @xmath32 , then @xmath102 is an affine copy of the classical lagrange spectrum @xmath33 . on the other hand , any @xmath98 in the orbit",
    "b7 always has an horizontal saddle connection that is winded on the horizontal closed geodesic of @xmath99 at most twice .",
    "when this second property holds one can apply a nice renormalization formula to compute the lagrange spectrum ( see theorem [ thm : renormalizedformula ] and remark [ remwhywechoseorbitb ] ) , whereas we do not know if the formula holds for arbitrary number of squares , where in general the second property does not hold .",
    "the two properties mentioned above make the orbit b7 one of the simplest orbit closures whose study is both non - trivial and accessible by renormalization techniques . in the notation of   [ sec : action - sltwoz - primitive - origamis ] , the other orbits with at most @xmath34 squares and satisfying the same two properties are the orbit a7 , which has @xmath103 elements , and the orbit with 6 squares in @xmath1 , which has @xmath104 elements . since the orbit b7 has @xmath104 elements we considered it as the easiest case to start from .",
