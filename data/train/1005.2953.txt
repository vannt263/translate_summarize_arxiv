    "the original aim of a spacetime wormhole was to connect two distinct , asymptotically flat ( af ) spacetimes , or two distant regions in the same af spacetime @xcite .",
    "in making such a short cut travel possible it is crucial that the traveller does nt encounter event horizons of black holes .",
    "a thin - shell may support such a wormhole provided it has the proper source to resist against the gravitational collapse .",
    "an exotic matter , which fails to satisfy the energy conditions has been used extensively to provide maintenance of such wormholes .",
    "the non - physical source of energy is confined on rather thin spherical shells , simply to invoke justification from quantum theory .",
    "more recently , however , it has been shown that without such resort , thin - shell wormholes can be constructed entirely from normal matter obeying the energy conditions @xcite .",
    "further , such wormholes established on realistic matter may be stable against radial , linear perturbations .",
    "clearly this implies that existence of wormholes may be an undeniable reality in our universe .    in @xmath0dimensional",
    "( 4d ) einstein - maxwell ( em ) theory it was not possible to employ normal matter in the construction / maintenance of thin - shell wormholes . in 5d , with the gauss - bonnet ( gb ) extension of em theory @xcite , it was further proved that stable , thin - shell wormholes supported by normal matter is possible provided the gb parameter takes negative values , i.e. @xmath1 @xcite@xmath2 is this true also for different sources such as yang - mills ( ym ) fields when considered in einstein - gauss - bonnet ( egb ) gravity ?",
    "the answer , to the best of our knowledge , is not in the affirmative .    in this letter",
    "we employ dilaton field beside ym field to investigate the reality of such thin - shell wormholes . in doing this",
    "it should be remembered that the strong coupling of dilaton turns the spacetime into a non - asymptotically flat ( naf ) one .",
    "this is a digression from the original idea of a wormhole since we have to revise the advantages of an af spacetime .",
    "we remind , however , that we have already enough familiarity with the cases of naf spacetimes , the best known one being the de ( anti)-sitter . for this reason we extend the concept of a wormhole in an af spacetime to a naf one through the prominent source of a dilaton .",
    "such a wormhole will provide traversability from one naf to another naf spacetime .",
    "for this purpose we employ d - dimensional solutions of einstein - yang - mills - dilaton ( eymd ) theory found recently @xcite , and investigate thin - shell construction in such geometries .",
    "it turns out that in the dilatonic thin - shells the required source must be exotic .",
    "our findings show , against our expectation that neither the ym charge , nor the dilatonic parameter have significant effect on the negative energy density of the thin - shell .",
    "a deeper reasoning should be sought in the kaluza - klein reduction procedure in which dilaton is created from higher dimensional em theory .",
    "the latter needs also an exotic matter to support and maintain a thin - shell wormhole . to have anything but exotic , with reference to our past experience ,",
    "the dilaton must vanish and additional geometrical structures , such as gauss - bonnet ( gb ) terms must be added .",
    "the letter is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we give a brief review of the d - dimensional eymd gravity .",
    "dynamic thin - shell wormhole construction and stability analysis is presented in sec .",
    "the paper ends with our conclusion , which appears in sec .",
    "we consider the @xmath3dimensional action in the eymd theory as @xmath4@xmath5where@xmath6@xmath7 is the dilaton scalar potential , the parameter @xmath8 denotes the coupling between dilaton and yang - mills ( ym ) field and as usual @xmath9 is the ricci scalar .",
    "the ym field @xmath10forms @xmath11 are given by @xcite@xmath12 in which @xmath13 are the structure constants , @xmath14 is a coupling constant and the ym potential @xmath15forms are given by@xmath16which is the higher dimensional wu - yang ansatz @xcite .",
    "the field equations , after varying the action , are given by@xmath17@xmath18 , \\]]@xmath19 in which @xmath20 is the ricci tensor and the hodge star @xmath21 means duality . as it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , these equations admit black hole solution in the form of @xmath22where @xmath23 is the line element on @xmath24 and the solution can be summarized as follows @xmath25we abbreviate here@xmath26and @xmath27 stands for the radius of event horizon . here",
    "@xmath28 implies the quasilocal mass ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "consider two copies of the eymd spacetime @xmath29and paste them at the boundary hypersurface @xmath30 .",
    "these surfaces are identified on @xmath31 with a surface energy - momentum of a thin - shell such that geodesic completeness holds . following the darmois - israel formalism @xcite in terms of the original coordinates @xmath32 ( i.e. on @xmath28 ) the induced metric @xmath33 on @xmath34 is given by ( latin indices run over the induced",
    "coordinates i.e. , @xmath35 and greek indices run over the original manifold s coordinates i.e. , @xmath36)@xmath37we shall study now the dynamic thin - shell wormhole by letting the throat radius to be a function of proper time @xmath38 , i.e. @xmath39 .",
    "( a @xmath0dimensional formalism similar to these section can be found in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "one can easily show that the induced metric is in the form@xmath40the parametric equation of the hypersurface @xmath34 is given by @xmath41and the normal unit vectors to @xmath42 defined by @xmath43are found as follows@xmath44upon using@xmath45it implies@xmath46similarly one finds that@xmath47after the unit @xmath3normal , one finds the extrinsic curvature tensor components from the definition@xmath48it follows that @xmath49also @xmath50 in sum , we have@xmath51which implies @xmath52and therefore@xmath53the surface energy - momentum components of the thin - shell are @xcite@xmath54which yield@xmath55by substitution one can show that the energy conservation takes the form @xmath56 in which @xmath57 is the area of the thin - shell . in other words , due to the exchange with the bulk spacetime , the energy on the shell is not conserved .",
    "let us note that we adopt the junction conditions of general relativity which can be justified by the fact that the dilaton field @xmath7 and its normal derivative are both continuous across the shell .",
    "similar approach has been followed by different authors @xcite which can be justified easily by integrating the dilaton equation ( 7 ) across the throat radius @xmath58 in the limit as @xmath59 since the singularity and horizons all reside deliberately at distances @xmath60 , the contribution from the dilaton field and its derivative to the thin - shell source vanishes .",
    "we note that this is different in the case of brans - dicke ( bd ) scalar field , which has structural difference compared with the dilaton field @xcite .",
    "to say the least among others , the exponential coupling of dilaton with the gauge field makes it short ranged whereas bd field is long ranged . to calculate the amount of exotic matter needed to construct the traversable wormhole we use the integral@xmath61for a thin - shell wormhole @xmath62 and @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the dirac delta function . in static configuration ,",
    "a simple calculation gives @xmath65    we aim now to apply a small radial perturbation around the radius of equilibrium @xmath66 and to investigate the behavior of the throat under this perturbation .",
    "for this perturbation we consider the radial pressure of the thin - shell to be a linear function of the energy density , i.e. , @xcite@xmath67here @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the radial pressure and energy density of the thin - shell in the static configuration of radius @xmath66 which are given by @xmath70and @xmath71 is a constant related to the speed of sound . by substituting ( 32 ) into ( 31 ) , one finds a first order differential equation for @xmath72 which is given by @xmath73or equivalently@xmath74 = \\left ( d-2\\right ) \\left ( \\sigma _ { 0}\\beta ^{2}-p_{0}\\right ) \\frac{h^{\\prime } \\left ( a\\right ) } { h\\left ( a\\right ) } .\\ ] ]    this equation , for the case of eymd wormhole introduced before can be expressed as @xmath75 in which@xmath76this equation admits a solution in the form of@xmath77which obviously at @xmath78 is nothing but @xmath79 in terms of the metric function @xmath80 in a dynamic case @xmath81 was given by ( 35 ) which after equating with the latter expression we obtain @xmath82here the potential function @xmath83 is given by @xmath84 ^{2}.\\]]we notice that @xmath85 and more tediously @xmath86 both vanish at @xmath87 the stability requirement for equilibrium reduces therefore to the determination of the regions in which@xmath88 for this reason we shall proceed through numerical analysis to see whether stability regions/ islands develop and under what conditions . let us note that our figures refer to @xmath89 , for @xmath90 we observed that no significant changes take place . in fig.s 1 - 2",
    "we show the stability regions in terms of @xmath91 and wormhole throat @xmath92 ( note that we use scalings @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 in terms of the ym charge @xmath96 and we plot ( @xmath97 ) ) .",
    "we also show @xmath98 in terms of @xmath66 for different values of @xmath99 . as stated before ,",
    "our wormhole is supported entirely by negative energy , @xmath100 on the shell . for changing dilatonic parameter @xmath99",
    "the change in @xmath98 is visible in the plots shown .",
    "for fixed mass , decreasing @xmath8 improves @xmath98 toward zero line but yet in the @xmath101 domain .",
    "the pressure on the shell increases with increasing @xmath8 .",
    "it is noticed from the dark stability regions that no stable region forms for @xmath102 , i.e. below the speed of light .",
    "consideration of dimensions @xmath90 , does nt change the behaviors of @xmath89 much , this can be seen by further plots which we shall ignore in this study .",
    "we have introduced @xmath3dimensional thin - shell wormholes in eymd gravity supported by exotic matter .",
    "although in quantum theory such matter finds acceptance on reasonable grounds in classical physics we should be more cautious . by choosing finely - tuned parameters of mass and dilaton parameter @xmath99",
    "we provide the stability of such wormholes against linear , radial perturbations . for any finite ym charge which amounts to scale the energy and pressure no significant difference",
    "is observed in the plots .",
    "it should be added that extreme ym charge , such as @xmath103 results in extreme energy ( but still ( @xmath104 ) ) and pressure conditions . when the ym and dilaton fields vanish we recover the previously known results .",
    "inclusion of dilaton converts the spacetime from asymptotically flat ( af ) to non - asymptotically flat ( naf ) case and only exotic matter can support such a wormhole .",
    "we recall that wormholes in naf universe ( without dilaton ) is not a new idea @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the mass is no more that of adm but rather the quasi - local mass is implied .",
    "vanishing of dilaton brings us to eym theory , which may be supplemented with modified gravity to pave the way toward wormholes with normal matter .",
    "we have shown elsewhere that inclusion of gauss - bonnet ( gb ) term accomplishes this task and provides stable , thin - shell wormholes with normal ( i.e. non - exotic ) matter @xcite .",
