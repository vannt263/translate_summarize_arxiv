    "discovery of the neutral scalar with properties very close to what we expect for the sm higgs boson @xcite and absence of any definite hints of supersymmetry at lhc asks for its replacement as a solution to gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "some hope is associated with conformal or scale invariance that might be a symmetry of the sm at tree level , but for the only dimensionfull parameter of the sm @xmath6 which gives the vacuum expectation value to the englert  brout  higgs ( ebh ) field .",
    "yet this parameter may be generated by the vacuum expectation value of a new scalar field ( scale invariance breaking messenger ) introduced into particle physics , so that the sm sector is scale invariant at tree level .",
    "the field itself may be used to solve other sm problems . here",
    "we discuss the idea that it may serve as an inflaton in the early universe .",
    "the renormalizable model realizing this idea was suggested in @xcite and further developed in @xcite . in this letter",
    "we assume that the sm sector of the model is scale invariant , in order to alleviate the hierarchy problem of the higgs mass .",
    "the only violation of scale invariance is assumed to be present in the inflaton , which can be considered as a messenger of the scale symmetry breaking , exact mechanism of this breaking is beyond the present analysis .",
    "technically this means that we assumed that other dimensionful parameters , like higgs boson mass term or cubic terms in the potential are small and can be neglected .",
    "introducing these terms at electroweak scale would not change the phenomenology of the model . with only one dimensionfull",
    "parameter explicitly breaking scale invariance in the inflaton sector , the model is consistent with cosmological observations @xcite and constraints from particle physics related to the possible manifestation of the light inflaton in b - meson decays @xcite .",
    "the model may be further extended by introducing three majorana fermions @xmath7 , @xmath8 , which are singlets with respect to the sm gauge group .",
    "yukawa - type coupling to inflaton provides these fermions with majorana mass terms when the inflaton field obtains vacuum expectation value .",
    "the yukawa - type couplings between @xmath7 , ebh doublet , and sm lepton doublets lead to dirac masses for neutrinos , and the active neutrino masses are then obtained from seesaw type i formula @xcite .",
    "hence the fermions serve as sterile neutrinos , and the yukawa couplings in a part of the parameter space may explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe via leptogenesis , e.g.  implementing the @xmath9msm scheme @xcite . remarkably ,",
    "the lightest sterile neutrino @xmath10 , provided tiny coupling to active neutrinos , may serve as non - thermal dm produced by inflaton decays in the early universe @xcite .",
    "therefore the suggested model with seven new degrees of freedom added to the sm explains the neutrino oscillations , dm phenomena , baryon asymmetry of the universe and exhibits the inflationary dynamics at early times thus solving the hot big bang theory problems .    given the allowed range of the inflaton mass",

    "we outline the viable region of the model parameter space consistent with this choice of sterile neutrino mass and give definite predictions for the inflationary cosmological parameters and the inflaton mass , its lifetime and branching ratio of b - meson to inflaton which _ allow to thoroughly investigate this model_. remarkably , recent results of bicep2 experiment @xcite on detection of b - mode polarization , interpreted as primordial tensor perturbations , can completely fix all the parameters of the model .",
    "the action of the light inflaton model augmented with three sterile neutrinos is @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the scalar curvature , @xmath15 is the sm lagrangian without the ebh field potential , and @xmath16 stands for the renormalizable extension of the sm by 3 sterile neutrinos @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) being lepton doublets and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is @xmath21 antisymmetric matrix and @xmath22 is the ebh doublet .    with potential inflaton field @xmath23",

    "the particle spectrum in vacuum consists of the higgs boson @xmath32 and the inflaton @xmath0 of the mass @xmath31 , which are mixed ( as compared to the @xmath33 basis ) by a small mixing angle @xmath34 hence , the branching ratios of the inflaton decay into the sm particles ( see @xcite for details ) are fixed for a given inflaton mass , see fig .",

    "one can obtain the analytic solution of ( [ kineq ] ) in the approximation of the time - independent effective number of degrees of freedom @xcite , but this approximation is not accurate enough for the interesting mass region @xmath56 .",

    "the case of different @xmath39 can be easily reconstructed by shifting the line according to ( [ beta - for - mchi ] ) .",

    "the moment mixing angle is known the rates of meson decays to the inflaton are determined .",
    "the most promising for the inflaton searches is the two - body decay of b - meson to kaon and inflaton , whose branching ratio is @xcite @xmath66 and is also presented in figure  [ fig : particle - features ] for the mixing @xmath67 corresponding to the proper dm generation ( figure  [ fig : particle - parameters ] ) .",
    "present accuracy in measurements of ( limits on ) three - body decays of b - meson into kaon and lepton pair , kaon and pion pair , kaon and kaon pair are at the level of @xmath68 @xcite and they are certainly relevant for short - lived inflaton , @xmath69s . at longer lifetimes ( lower masses ) ,",
    "though the branching is still be rather large ( figure  [ fig : particle - features ] ) , the inflaton either escapes the detector or gives rise to an event with a displaced decay vertex .",
    "thus , the existing limits on three body b meson decays can not be straightforwardly translated to the bounds on the inflaton and additional analysis is required to find the exact region of parameters excluded from b decay experiments .",
    "the most significant experimental bound today can be obtained from the charm experiment @xcite . in this experiment",
    "the inflaton is created in the beam target and then the decay products of the inflaton is searched in the detector which is placed at some distance .",
    "this method effectively bounds long lived inflatons @xcite .",
    "the corresponding bound is presented in [ fig : particle - parameters ] .     for the model with sterile neutrino dm of 7 mass . ]",
    "one can also check , that the required higgs - inflaton coupling @xmath70 is within the bounds from reheating ( to happen in the early universe before electroweak sphaleron processes terminated ) and radiative corrections ( not to spoil the inflaton potential ) @xcite for all interesting inflaton masses , see figure  [ fig : particle - parameters ] .",
    "the non - minimal coupling @xmath37 determines uniquely the spectral index @xmath71 and the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath41 of the primordial perturbations .",
    "we give the cosmological predictions for the interesting inflaton mass range in figure  [ fig : cosmo - parameters ] .",

    "another important property is the momentum distribution of the generated dm neutrino .",
    "there are stringent bound on the free streaming length of a potentially warm dm candidate from the analysis of the lyman-@xmath27 forest @xcite .",
    "while the exact reanalysis of the bounds is complicated , as far as one should take into account the non - thermal shape of the spectrum , an estimate can be obtained by simple comparison of the average momentum of the generated dm neutrino .",
    "this is a good approximation , as far as in our case the spectral distribution does not have sharp resonant - like features .",
    "the average momentum of the neutrino is @xcite ( at temperatures @xmath72 just above neutrino freeze - out ) @xmath73 which is below the usual thermal average of @xmath74 .",
    "one can then deduce the mass bounds from the analysis of structure formation .",
    "there are two types of bounds present in the literature : thermal relic bounds @xmath75 for the particles with the distribution of the thermal shape but lower temperature ; and non - resonantly produced neutrino bound @xmath76 , which has been obtained for @xmath77 and overall suppressed distribution .",
    "these bound can be translated to our case , which is intermediate ( both average momentum is below thermal and overall distribution is suppressed ) , as @xmath78 where @xmath79 . for the inflaton mass in the interesting range",
    "the corresponding lower limits on the fermion dm mass are outlined in figure  [ ly - a ] .",

    "the lower and upper plots correspond to the bounds from @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the 7 value is marked for reference . ]",
    "the 7 dm is consistent with the first more conservative analysis @xcite of lyman-@xmath27 forest data , but has tensions with the later analysis .",
    "in the model , where the non - minimally coupled inflaton serves as the only scale invariance breaking messenger for sm with three sterile neutrinos , sterile neutrino dm can be generated in the inflaton decaysmsm . ] . in bosonic sector",
    "the model introduces three additional parameters  non - minimal coupling to gravity @xmath37 , inflaton self coupling @xmath25 , and the inflaton mass @xmath31 .",
    "the amplitude of the primordial perturbations relates first two of these parameters , @xmath37 and @xmath25 .",
    "requirement of the proper abundance of the dm with a given mass @xmath39 provides the relation between the second pair , @xmath25 and @xmath31 .",
    "thus , assuming the mass of the dm is known , the only free parameter left is the inflaton mass . for numerical estimates",
    "we take @xmath12 , motivated by recent results @xcite .",
    "further constraints on the model can be made from inflationary observations , specifically the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath41 .",
    "exact knowledge of @xmath41 would fix the value of @xmath37 , and , thus , the inflaton mass @xmath31 leaving no free parameters ( see figures  [ fig : particle - parameters2 ] and [ fig : cosmo - parameters ] ) .",
    "recent observation of @xmath80 by bicep2 @xcite is in some tension with the charm bound on our model .",
    "however , if the dust foregrounds give major contribution to the bicep2 signal , @xmath41 may be smaller and agree with predictions of our model .",
    "thus , improvement or verification of the charm bound and independent checks of the bicep2 result by multifrequency experiments are essential .",
    "note also , that for heavier dm , @xmath81 , larger @xmath82 become allowed ( cf.figure  [ fig : particle - parameters2 ] and eq .",
    "( [ beta - for - mchi ] ) ) .",
    "the resulting low mass range is especially interesting , as far as for the inflaton masses of @xmath83 the inflaton can be produced and searched in b - meson decays , see decay rate and inflaton lifetime in figure  [ fig : particle - features ] . for the lower masses",
    "the lifetime of the inflaton is relatively long and the most interesting signature is the offset vertex of the inflaton decay into muon or pion pair after the b - meson decay vertex . for the higher masses the inflaton lifetime drops rapidly , and",
    "the possible signature is the peak in the b - meson three body decay kinematics .",
    "note that the expected event rates are comparable with the current experimental sensitivity @xcite .",
    "the lightest allowed inflatons may be searched for in beam - dump experiments ( e.g. see ship * ref * for charm successor ) .    finally , we should note , that there are ways to slightly relax the relations for the model parameters .",
    "first is the possibility of the entropy generation in the decays of the heavier sterile neutrinos after the dm generation ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "this allows for slightly larger @xmath25 for given @xmath31 , leading to larger higgs - inflaton mixing @xmath67 , larger @xmath37 , and smaller @xmath41 .",
    "additional generation of dm sterile neutrino @xmath10 after the inflaton decay ( as in @xcite ) leads to the opposite effect .",
    "more significant deviations is possible if we allow for additional sources of the violations of the scale invariance .",
    "specifically , allowing for arbitrary mass terms for the sterile neutrinos independent of the inflaton coupling would allow to relax all the relations for the dm generation .",
    "if 7 sterile neutrino is not the dominant component of dm , @xmath85 , higgs - inflaton mixing @xmath67 is smaller , hence larger @xmath41 is allowed .",
    "it is worth to study thoroughly the consistency of the particular mechanism of dm production with observations of ly-@xmath27 forest , since present lower limits on the dm free - streaming @xcite fall in the right ballpark .",
