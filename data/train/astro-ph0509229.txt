    "the emission is produced by hydrogen that lies between the neutral gas in the spectrum of q1549-d10 and the bright illuminating source hs1549 + 1919 , and its offset from the neutral gas , @xmath68 , is consistent with theoretical expectations for the size of dlas ( e.g. , mcdonald & miralda - escud 1999 ; haehnelt , steinmetz , & rauch 2000 ; zheng & miralda - escud 2002a ) .",

    "our detection of the emitting region in the @xmath25 and @xmath27 bands ( figure  [ fig : g_contour ] ; table  [ tab : dla ] ) implies that it has substantial luminosity in the continuum . comparing its observed @xmath25-band magnitude , @xmath69 , to the flux detected in the emission line",

    "this is several times smaller than would be expected if the emission were powered solely by the distant qso ( see , e.g. , the calculation in the appendix ) .",
    "we are forced to conclude that the continuum receives a substantial contribution from some other source , presumably the stars that are associated with the dla .",
    "cccccc 15 51 49.6 & 19 10 41 & @xmath71 & @xmath72 & @xmath73 & @xmath74 + [ tab : dla ]    this does not contradict the idea that the lyman-@xmath0 line is powered primarily by fluorescence ( cf .",
    "fynbo , thomsen , & moller 2000 ) .",
    "the dla s strong metal lines imply that it ought to contain stars , and the calculation in the appendix suggests that the fluorescence should be produced by material that lies only @xmath75 from the center of the dla potential , which is presumably where any stars would be found .",
    "one could have anticipated its relatively small equivalent width .    could local emission from the dla power the entire lyman-@xmath0 line ?",
    "although we can not rule out the possibility , it seems implausible to us .",
    "first , this type of lyman-@xmath0 line is rarely produced by stars .",
    "only 2% of randomly selected lyman - break galaxies at this redshift have a lyman-@xmath0 emission line with so large an equivalent width ( steidel et al .",
    "velocity widths @xmath76 km s@xmath19 are observed only in the merging or active galaxies of the lyman - break sample , and we see no sign of either the rapid star formation that would accompany the former or the other broad emission lines ( civ , etc . ) that would accompany the latter .",
    "although broad and strong lyman-@xmath0 lines are ( not surprisingly ) more common among galaxies discovered in lyman-@xmath0 surveys ( e.g. , francis et al .",
    "2004 ) , fluorescence remains the best explanation for the observed double - peaked profile .",
    "second , regardless of its stellar content , the dla is optically thick to lyman - continuum photons and lies near a very bright source .",
    "it is guaranteed to fluoresce unless the qso s radiation is beamed or has not yet had time to reach it .",
    "isotropically emitted lyman - continuum photons from the qso will have reached the dla at the time of observation as long as the qso was shining at the earlier time @xmath77/c$ ] , where @xmath78 and @xmath79/(1+\\bar z)$ ] are the proper separations of the qso and dla perpendicular and parallel to the line of sight , @xmath80 is the angular diameter distance , @xmath81 is the comoving distance to redshift @xmath51 , and @xmath82 ( e.g. , adelberger 2004 ) . if the dla and qso have exactly the same redshift , so that @xmath83 , then photons will reach the dla roughly @xmath84 myr after they were emitted .",
    "since the dla will probably not begin to fluoresce brightly until @xmath85 myr after it is first illuminated ( see the appendix ) , we would expect to see fluorescent emission as long as the qso has been radiating for at least @xmath86 myr",
    ". the minimum lifetime could be somewhat longer or shorter , depending on the actual value of @xmath87 , but if @xmath87 were significantly different from 0 the luminosity of the lyman-@xmath0 line would be too large to be explained by the qso s radiation .",
    "uncertainty in the velocity difference between the qso and dla , 270 km s@xmath19 ( richards et al . 2002 ) , corresponds to a proper distance of @xmath88 kpc . if the dla lay this far behind the qso , its expected surface brightness would decrease by a factor of @xmath89 but its illuminated size would nearly double .",
    "the predicted lyman-@xmath0 flux would be consistent with our observations as long as the dla were somewhat larger than we have assumed . in this case",
    "the implied length of the qso lifetime would be @xmath90 myr .",
    "if the dla lay in front of the qso by 920 kpc , however , only a small fraction of its illuminated surface would be visible to us and the flux would be far lower than we have observed . ]    regardless of the origin of the line , we can conclude that this dla has a size of at least @xmath68 . if @xmath3 is the typical radius of dlas , then their observed number per unit redshift interval , @xmath91 ( e.g. , boissier , proux , & pettini 2003 ) , corresponds to a comoving number density of @xmath92 mpc@xmath93 .",
    "the average qso would therefore have @xmath94 dla within @xmath95 mpc ( i.e. , @xmath96 projected ) if dlas and qsos were spatially uncorrelated and @xmath97 within the same radius if the qso - dla correlation function were similar to the qso - lbg correlation function , @xmath98 ( adelberger & steidel 2005 ) .",
    "fluorescing systems similar to the one we have observed should therefore be common if qsos live longer than a few myr and optically thick clouds are not destroyed by their radiation .",
    "systematic surveys for them ( e.g. , moller , warren , & fynbo 1998 ; fynbo et al .",
    "2000 ; francis & bland - hawthorn 2004 ) should provide interesting constraints on the lifetimes of qsos and the nature of intergalactic clouds .",
    "kla was educated by his discussions with t. abel , a. gould , m. rauch , d. weinberg , and ( especially ) j. miralda - escud , who suggested a power - law density profile for intergalactic clouds and pointed out that it implied equation  [ eq : ri_o_rf ] .",
    "r. simcoe tracked down a raw hires spectrum and confirmed the redshift of hs1549 + 1919 .",
    "we are grateful to our collaborators d. erb , m. pettini , and a. shapley for their enormous contributions to our ongoing survey .",
    "in the text we assumed that the ionization front from the qso would advance most of the way to the center of the dla , that the dla would not glow brightly in lyman-@xmath0 until the ionization front was close to its final radius , and that the rest - frame equivalent width of fluorescent lyman-@xmath0 would be at least @xmath99300  unless the continuum received a contribution from some other source .",
    "the last two assumptions should be true in general .",
    "the first will be true if the gas is smooth and centrally concentrated but may be false otherwise . our reasoning is illustrated below with a simple physical model .",
    "please recall that observed damped lyman-@xmath0 systems show a wide range of kinematic properties , from the simple to the clumpy and complex ( e.g. , prochaska & wolfe 1997 ; prochaska & wolfe 1998 ) . the model s predictions should not be taken as anything other than a very rough guide .",
    "we begin with a brief overview of the physical situation .",
    "before it is struck by radiation from the qso , the hydrogen at the optically thick edge of the dla will presumably be in rough thermal and ionization equilibrium with the ambient radiation field , recombining as fast as it is ionized and emitting energy as fast as energy is absorbed . if the qso has the same spectrum as the ambient background , its radiation will increase both the heating and ionization rates by the same factor @xmath61 , driving the cloud wildly out of equilibrium .",
    ", derived in the main body of the text , is appropriate for a dla that lies @xmath100 proper mpc from a qso with the magnitude of hs1549 + 1919 . ]",
    "an ionization front will advance into the cloud . at first",
    "the recently ionized material will not be able to cool from its initial temperature of @xmath101k ( abel & haehnelt 1999 ) .",
    "the front will advance until it encounters material dense enough to recombine as fast as it is ionized .",
    "it will stall .",
    "the cooling rate will now exceed the heating rate , and the ionized material will cool until it reaches the same temperature it had before the radiation blast arrived .",
    "when the qso s radiation arrives , the initial and final equilibrium temperatures must be the same . ]",
    "the cloud will finally arrive at the equilibrium situation envisioned by gould & weinberg ( 1996 ) .",
    "we estimate the stalling radius for the ionization front by assuming that the cloud is centrally concentrated , with a mean density profile that varies with radius as @xmath102 . in this case the integrated recombination rate for all the material exterior to radius @xmath103 along a column of fixed cross - section is proportional to @xmath104 .",
    "an increase in the ionization rate by a factor of @xmath57 will be balanced by recombinations only when the radius has shrunk by the factor @xmath105 or @xmath106 if @xmath61 and the cloud has an isothermal profile ( i.e. , @xmath107 ) .",
    "the qso radiation that is pointed directly at the center of the dla will therefore advance most of the way to the center before it stalls .",
    "if the initial ionized edge of the dla lies at a radius of @xmath3 , the stalling radius will be @xmath75 . since the recombination rate ( and hence lyman-@xmath0 luminosity ) is proportional to @xmath108 when the ionization front is at radius @xmath103 , and @xmath109",
    ", the lyman-@xmath0 emission will not be bright enough for easy detection until the ionization front is quite close to its stalling radius .",
    "we conclude that the separation between the lyman-@xmath0 fluorescence and the center of the dla is unlikely to be resolvable from the ground .",
    "clumping in the gas will not alter this conclusion as long as the strength of clumping @xmath110 does not depend strongly on @xmath103 .",
    "the same model provides a rough estimate of the time required for the cloud to reach its new equilibrium .",
    "since the column density of material exterior to radius @xmath103 is proportional to @xmath111 , the qso will have to ionize a neutral hydrogen column of @xmath112 = n_i [ g^{(\\gamma-1)/(2\\gamma-1)}-1]$ ] as it advances from the initial to the final radius .",
    "@xmath113 , the total ( neutral plus ionized ) hydrogen column density exterior to @xmath114 , is likely to be roughly @xmath115 @xmath9 , since the optically thick edge of the cloud has a neutral hydrogen column density of @xmath116 @xmath9 and the typical neutral fraction at this radius is @xmath117 ( zheng & miralda - escud 2002a ) . because the ionization rate is @xmath118 , where @xmath45 is the inward flux of hydrogen - ionizing photons ( @xmath9 s@xmath19 ) in the ambient radiation field ( equation  [ eq : fc0 ] ) , the rough time scale for reaching the equilibrium radius is @xmath119 for @xmath120 .",
    "the required time is @xmath121 yr for @xmath122 , @xmath123 @xmath9 , and @xmath124 .",
    "this is almost short enough to ignore in the present case , but could be significant for dlas that are less intensely illuminated .",
    "uncertainties in @xmath113 mean that this time - scale should not be ignored in general .",
    "clumping in the gas does not alter the expected value of @xmath125 but causes its actual value vary randomly among different rays towards the center of the dla .",
    "these variations could be large for dlas with significant sub - structure .      in ionization equilibrium",
    ", the photoionization rate at radius @xmath103 will equal the recombination rate at the same radius .",
    "most lyman - continuum photons will therefore be absorbed in regions with low neutral fraction ( @xmath126@xmath127 ) , since these are the regions with the highest recombination rates .",
    "the energy of the lyman - continuum photons will have to be dissipated by mostly ionized gas .",
    "assume momentarily that the gas is completely ionized .",
    "in this case , recombination and brehmsstrahlung would be the main cooling processes at the relevant range of densities and temperatures . according to the rate coefficients collected in tables  1 and  2 of katz , weinberg , & hernquist ( 1996 ) , energy losses from h and he recombination",
    "will exceed those from brehmsstrahlung by a factor of around @xmath128@xmath129 , with the exact factor depending on the temperature and on the dominant ionization state of he .",
    "these same coefficients imply that the time - scale @xmath130 for recombination cooling should be 23 times the recombination time - scale @xmath131 .",
    "since the recombination time - scale is proportional to @xmath132 , and had initial value @xmath133myr , the cooling time at the stalling radius for completely ionized gas is 23 times longer than @xmath134 myr , or @xmath135 myr . here",
    "@xmath136k and @xmath137k are the temperatures in the ionized skin of the dla before and after the qso s radiation arrives .",
    "figure  1 of katz et al .",
    "( 1996 ) shows that line cooling is roughly two orders of magnitude faster than recombination cooling for predominantly neutral gas at these temperatures , and so the actual cooling time could be significantly shorter than @xmath138 myr if ( as seems likely ) the residual neutral fraction in the absorbing gas is greater than @xmath126 .",
    "we conclude that the gas is likely to have reached a nearly equilibrium temperature , but uncertainties in @xmath113 mean that one should not always assume that this is the case .    because recombination cooling proceeds 23 times faster than brehmsstrahlung cooling , roughly 70% of the energy absorbed from lyman - continuum photons would be carried out of the cloud by recombination photons if the absorbing gas were completely ionized . with 40% of the escaping recombination energy in the form of lyman-@xmath0 photons ( gould & weinberg 1996 ) , the lyman-@xmath0 luminosity would equal @xmath139% of the absorbed lyman - continuum luminosity in this case .",
    "gould & weinberg ( 1996 ) show that the fraction rises to @xmath140% if the absorbing gas is predominantly neutral .",
    "the actual fraction will be bracketed by these two values .",
    "the remaining energy will emerge either in other h / he recombination lines or in a continuum produced by two - photon decay and by the first ( i.e. , free - bound ) photons of the recombination cascades .",
    "much of this remaining energy will emerge in the wavelength range @xmath141 ( i.e. , 611 ev ) covered by our @xmath25 and @xmath27 broad - band images , but even if all of it were concentrated in that range it would not be enough relative to lyman-@xmath0 to explain the relatively small observed equivalent width of the lyman-@xmath0 line .",
    "this conclusion holds equally well for smooth and clumpy gas .",

    "<S> we have detected lyman-@xmath0 emission from a damped lyman - alpha system ( dla ) that lies near the bright quasar hs1549 + 1919 . </S>",
    "<S> the dla has the same redshift as hs1549 + 1919 and was discovered in the spectrum of a faint qso that lies @xmath1 away ( @xmath2 proper kpc ) . </S>",
    "<S> the emission line s luminosity , double - peaked profile , and small spatial separation from the dla suggest that it may be fluorescent lyman-@xmath0 emission from gas that is absorbing the nearby qso s radiation . </S>",
    "<S> if this is the case , our observations show that the dla has a size of at least @xmath3 and that the qso s luminosity one million years ago was similar to its luminosity today . a survey for similar systems within @xmath4 of bright qsos would put interesting limits on the mean quasar lifetime . </S>"
