    "the high energies available in hadronic collisions at the large hadron collider determine an abundant production of hard probes , such as heavy quarks , quarkonia , high-@xmath3  jets and intermediate vector bosons ( @xmath4  and @xmath5 ) .",
    "the large masses of w ( 80 gev/@xmath6 ) and z ( 91 gev/@xmath6 ) bosons imply that they are formed during initial hard parton scattering processes with a formation time of about 0.003 fm/@xmath7 and the mean decay time , which is inversely proportional to their width , is about 0.09 fm/@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "precise theoretical predictions of the w- and z - boson cross sections in proton - proton collisions make them good standard candles for luminosity measurements .",
    "in addition , they can be used to constrain parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) at high momentum transfer ( _ q _ ) equal or larger than the mass of the vector bosons . in high - energy heavy - ion collisions where nuclear matter undergoes a phase transition to a deconfined state called quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , these electroweak bosons decay either before or during the formation of the qgp .",
    "vector bosons and their leptonic decay products do not interact strongly and thus they should not be affected by the qgp .",
    "therefore , they give access to the initial - state properties in nuclear collisions and their yields provide a benchmark for the binary collision scaling of hard processes .",
    "finally , the isospin dependent production of w and z bosons and their weak coupling nature makes them good probes to study initial - state effects ( for example , the nuclear modification of pdfs and isospin effects ) in proton - lead and lead - lead collisions @xcite .",
    "the alice experiment  @xcite is an ensemble of various detectors each with a specific purpose .",
    "the v0 scintillators , the second layer of the silicon pixel detector ( spd ) and the zero degree calorimeters ( zdc ) are used to characterize events according to their activity ( measure of centrality ) .",
    "event activity estimators v0a(c ) and cl1 associated with v0-a(c ) and spd classify events according to the charged - particle multiplicity , whereas zna(c ) uses the neutron energy deposited in the zdc .",
    "the events are divided into four equal bins of event activity corresponding to 20% fraction of events ( 0 - 20% , 20 - 40 % , 40 - 60% and 60 - 80% ) .",
    "the v0 scintillators , covering the pseudorapidity ranges @xmath8 ( v0a ) and @xmath9 ( v0c ) are also used for triggering .",
    "the spd second layer covers the @xmath10 pseudorapidty region .",
    "the zero degree calorimeters ( znc and zna ) are located 112 meters away on either side of the interaction point along the beam pipe .",
    "the muon spectrometer has a forward pseudorapidity coverage of @xmath11 and consists of an absorber , five tracking stations , a dipole magnet , a muon filter and two triggering stations .",
    "the absorber reduces the background from pions and kaons , such that mostly muons enter the tracking system where their transverse momentum ( @xmath3 ) is determined .",
    "furthermore , the muon filter , placed between the tracking and trigger stations , stops remaining background hadrons and low momentum muons ( @xmath12 gev/_c _ ) to ensure high purity of the triggered muon - candidate sample .",
    "in addition , the triggering stations provide an approximate @xmath3  measurement which is employed for the trigger decision . + the results described here are based on a data sample collected in proton - lead ( p  pb ) collisions at @xmath13 tev ( @xmath14 tev and @xmath15 /@xmath16 tev ) in which two beam configurations were used , protons going towards the spectrometer ( p  pb ) and vice - versa ( pb  p ) . the asymmetry in energy translates into the centre - of - mass system boost of @xmath17 rapidity units in the proton direction .",
    "thus , the rapidity intervals covered by the muon spectrometer are , @xmath18 ( p  pb ) and @xmath19 ( pb  p ) , respectively , where the direction of the proton defines positive rapidities . henceforth , these will be respectively referred to as forward and backward rapidity .",
    "the data samples consist of events collected with minimum bias ( mb ) trigger in coincidence with high-@xmath3  single - muon ( msh ) and low-@xmath3  di - muon ( mul ) trigger , for w and z bosons respectively .",
    "the mb trigger is defined as the coincidence of signals in both v0 detectors .",
    "the single muon trigger is a coincidence between a mb trigger and the presence of a muon track in the triggering station with @xmath20 4 gev/_c_. the di - muon trigger is a coincidence of mb trigger and an un - like sign muon pair of @xmath20 0.5 gev/_c_. the single and di - muon triggered data samples are used for w and z bosons analysis respectively .",
    "the integrated luminosities were measured to be 5.01@xmath210.20 @xmath22 ( p  pb ) and 5.81@xmath210.2 @xmath22 ( pb  p ) @xcite .",
    "the muon tracks are required to be in the detector acceptance @xmath23 and to come from a reconstructed interaction vertex .",
    "another geometrical cut taken into consideration is the angle of the tracks at the end of the absorber covering the range @xmath24 , which rejects particles crossing non - uniform material sections at the absorber edges . in order to remove the background from interactions between beam particles and the residual gas , an additional cut _ _ p__@xmath25dca based on the product of the muon track momentum and its transverse distance of closest approach to the interaction point , is used to remove tracks which do not point to the interaction vertex .",
    "the analysis is based on the extraction of the w - boson decay contribution to the total single muon @xmath3  spectrum .",
    "the semi - muonic decays of w bosons form a jacobean peak with a maximum around @xmath26 .",
    "muons from z - boson ( @xmath27 ) decays are dominant source of background above @xmath28 gev/_c _ whereas muons from decays of heavy - flavour hadrons ( hf ) dominate the lower @xmath3  region ( @xmath29 gev/_c _ ) @xcite .",
    "the number of w bosons ( @xmath30 ) is extracted from the single - muon @xmath3  spectrum using a combined fit composed of suitable templates or functions for the various contributions .",
    "the templates for muons from w and z bosons are based on the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) event generator powheg @xcite and also pythia6.4 @xcite to take into account the nuclear modification of the pdfs ( npdf ) .",
    "the templates are generated for pp and pn collisions separately to account for the isospin dependence of w- and z - boson production and are determined for each @xmath31 interval .",
    "these templates are then combined into a fit function    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is either a phenomenological function @xcite or the fonll - based heavy - flavour decay - muon template @xcite and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are w- and @xmath27-boson decay templates . in equation",
    "[ comb_fit ] , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are free parameters whereas @xmath38 is constrained by the ratios of the measured cross sections computed with powheg and pythia6.4 .",

    "the number of muons from w - boson decays is extracted between 10 @xmath39 80 gev/_c _ as a weighted average over fitting trials ( varying fit range , background functions , fraction of z to w bosons and detector alignment ) .",
