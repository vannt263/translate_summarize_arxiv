    "this has given rise to the notion of `` encoded universality '' , in which a convenient physical interaction is made universal by encoding into a subspace @xcite .",
    "isotropic , anisotropic , and generalized forms of the exchange interaction have recently been shown to possess considerable power for efficient construction of universal gate sets , allowing explicit universal gate constructions that require only a small number of physical operations @xcite .    in this paper , we analyze non - local two - qubit operations from a geometric perspective and show that considerable insight can be achieved with this approach .",
    "we are concerned with three main questions here .",
    "first , achieving a geometric representation of two - qubit gates .",
    "second , characterizing or quantifying all operations that can generate maximal entanglement .",
    "third , exact simulation of any arbitrary two - qubit gates from a given two - body physical interaction together with single qubit gates .",
    "the fundamental mathematical techniques we employ are cartan decomposition and weyl group in the lie group representation theory .",
    "the application of these theories to the lie algebra @xmath0 provides us with a natural and intuitive geometric approach to investigate the properties of non - local two - qubit operations .",
    "this geometric approach reveals the nature of the problems intrinsically and allows a general formulation of solutions to the three issues of interest here .    because it is the non - local properties that generate entanglement in quantum systems , we first study the invariants and geometric representation of non - local two - qubit operations . a pair of two - qubit operations are called locally equivalent if they differ only by local operations .",
    "we apply the cartan decomposition theorem to @xmath0 , the lie algebra of the special unitary group @xmath8 .",
    "we find that the geometric structure of non - local gates is a 3-torus . on the other hand , the cartan decomposition of @xmath0 derived from the complexification of @xmath9",
    "yields an easy way to derive the invariants for local transformations .",
    "these invariants can be used to determine whether two gates are locally equivalent .",
    "moreover , we establish the relation of these local invariants to the coordinates of the 3-torus .",
    "this provides with a way to compute the corresponding points on the 3-torus for a given gate .",
    "it turns out that a single non - local gate may correspond to finitely many different points on the 3-torus .",
    "if we represent these points in a cube with side length @xmath10 , there is obvious symmetry between these points .",
    "we then use the weyl group theory to reduce this symmetry . we know that in this case the weyl group is generated by a set of reflections in @xmath11 .",
    "it is these reflections that create the kaleidoscopic symmetry of points that correspond to the same non - local gate in the cube .",
    "we can explicitly compute these reflections , and thereby show that the local equivalence classes of two - qubit gates are in one - to - one correspondence with the points in a tetrahedron except on the base .",
    "this provides a complete geometric representation of non - local two - qubit operations .",
    "the second objective of this paper is to explore the properties of perfect entanglers , that is , the quantum gates that can generate maximally entangled states from some initially separable states .",
    "we start with criteria to determine whether a given two - qubit gate is a perfect entangler .",
    "a condition for such a gate has been stated in  @xcite .",
    "we provide here a proof of this condition and show that the condition can be employed within our geometric analysis to determine which fraction of all non - local two - qubit gates are perfect entanglers .",
    "we show that the entangling property of a quantum gate is only determined by its geometric representation on the 3-torus . using the result that every point on the tetrahedron corresponds to a local equivalence class",
    ", we then show that the set of all perfect entanglers is a polyhedron with seven faces and possessing a volume equal to exactly half that of the tetrahedron .",
    "this implies that amongst all the non - local two - qubit operations , exactly half of them are capable of generating maximal entanglement .    finally , we explore universality and controllability aspects of non - local properties of given physical interactions and the potential of such specified hamiltonians to generate perfect entanglers .",
    "our motivation is related to that of encoded universality , namely , determining the potential for universal quantum computation and simulation of a given physical hamiltonian . however , whereas encoded universality sought to construct encodings to achieve universality of quantum logic , here we focus on the simulation of any arbitrary two - qubit gate .",
    "achievement of this , together with our second result above , allows generation of maximal entanglement as well as providing universality . to realize this , we consider here the conventional scenario of a hamiltonian acting on a physical set of qubits such that any arbitrary single qubit operation and certain specific two - qubit operations may be turned on for selected time durations in series .",
    "generally speaking , two - qubit interactions include both local and non - local terms .",
    "the non - local terms can give rise to not only well - known entangling gates such as cnot , but also to many other classes of gates that may or may not lie in the perfect entangling sector .",
    "we therefore seek a systematic way to construct quantum circuits from a given physical hamiltonian that can simulate _ any _ arbitrary two - qubit gate exactly , without restriction by limitations of speed due to time - scales of control interactions ( e.g. as in nmr ) or to fundamental considerations  @xcite . as in the study of encoded universality",
    "we start with the gates that can be directly generated by a given hamiltonian .",
    "generally , these gates form a one dimensional subset on the 3-torus . to construct an exact simulation of any arbitrary two - qubit gate , we make use of the quantum circuit model .",
    "we explicitly construct a quantum circuit that contains three non - local gates generated by a given two - body interaction hamiltonian for corresponding finite time durations , together with at most four local gates .",
    "we prove that such a quantum circuit can simulate _ any _ arbitrary two - qubit operation exactly and is therefore universal .",
    "in particular , it can therefore _ efficiently _ provide maximal entanglement from any arbitrary hamiltonian of this form .",
    "such efficient construction from any given hamiltonian is extremely useful for design and experimental implementation of quantum information processing schemes .",
    "in this section , we briefly review some basic facts about cartan decomposition and the weyl group within lie group representation theory  @xcite , and then apply these results to @xmath0 , the lie algebra of the special unitary group @xmath8 .",
    "applications of cartan decomposition to quantum system control can also be found in  @xcite .",
    "we concentrate on @xmath8 when studying two - qubit gates .",
    "it is well - known that an arbitrary two - qubit gate @xmath12 can be decomposed as the product of a gate @xmath13 and a global phase shift @xmath14 , where @xmath15 .",
    "because the global phase has no significance in quantum mechanics , we can thereby reduce the study of the group @xmath2 of two - qubit quantum evolution operators to @xmath8 .",
    "extensions of results from the group @xmath8 back to @xmath2 are made when appropriate .",
    "we heuristically introduce a partition of the set of two - qubit operations represented by the group @xmath8 .",
    "this set splits into two subsets , one of local gates @xmath16 and the other of non - local gates @xmath17 .",
    "the latter splits further into a set of perfect entanglers , _",
    "i.e. _ , those that can generate maximally entangled states , an example of which is cnot , and the complementary set of those non - local gates that are not perfect entanglers . this schematic partition is illustrated in fig .",
