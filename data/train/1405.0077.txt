    "in 1916 schwarzschild @xcite gave a solution of einstein s field equations which describes the gravitational field of a uncharged spherical non - rotating mass .",
    "it is known that the schwarzschild metric leads - via a canonical formalism that transposes the relativistic problem into the realm of celestial mechanics ( see @xcite ) - to a binet - type equation , which describes the motion as governed by a force originating in a potential of the form @xmath3 where @xmath1 is the relative distance between two mass points and @xmath4 the potential above , which we call the _ schwarzschild potential _ , was brought to the attention of the dynamics and celestial mechanics communities by mioc et al . in @xcite .",
    "classical dynamics in the schwarzschild potential has interesting features , quite distinct when compared to their newtonian counterparts .",
    "in particular , collisions may appear at non - zero angular momenta , giving rise to a so - called _ black - hole effect _",
    ", where a particle  falls \" into a schwarzschild source field while spinning infinitely many times around it .",
    "this is in contrast to the newtonian @xmath5-body problem where collision is possible only if the total angular momentum is zero .",
    "the black hole effect was introduced in celestial mechanics by diacu et al . in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . for the schwarzschild one - body problem ,",
    "the existence of the black hole effect was proven analytically in @xcite by employing a technique due to mcgehee @xcite for the regularization of the vector field s singularity at collision . since then , various studies concerning schwarzschild one- and two - body problems have appeared ( see @xcite ) .",
    "recently campanelli et al . @xcite",
    "have simulated numerically a three black hole system in the relativistic context , and observed that total collision is reached via spiral trajectories .",
    "one of the results of the present paper is proving that the same kind of dynamics is feasible in a classical mechanics model .",
    "we consider a particular case of the three body problem in which two equal point masses @xmath6 are confined to a horizontal plane , symmetrically disposed with respect to their common center of mass @xmath7 , and a third point mass @xmath8 is allowed to move only on the vertical axis perpendicular to the plane of masses @xmath9 through the point @xmath7 . at any time",
    ", the configuration formed by the three mass points is that of an isosceles triangle ( possibly degenerated to a segment ) and the only rotations allowed are with respect to the vertical axis on which @xmath8 lies .",
    "the dynamics is given , after taking into account the angular momentum conservation , by a two degree of freedom hamiltonian system .",
    "it can be shown that for a three mass point system with two equal masses and with rotationally invariant interactions , isosceles motions form a non - trivial invariant manifold of the three mass point system phase space .",
    "we call _ the isosceles schwarzschild problem _ the constrained three body problem as described above where the mutual interaction between the mass points is given by a schwarzschild potential of the form ( [ sch.po ] )",
    ". isosceles three body problems are often considered as case studies for the more complicated dynamics of the @xmath5-body problem .",
    "one of the main references is a study by devaney @xcite where the author employs mcgehee s technique @xcite and presents a qualitative description of the planar isosceles three body problem ( i.e. , the isosceles three body problem with zero angular momentum ) with emphasis on orbits which begin or end in a triple collision . in @xcite moeckel uses geometrical methods to construct an invariant set containing a variety of periodic orbits which exhibit close approaches to triple collision and wild changes of configuration .",
    "he also finds heteroclinic connections between these periodic orbits , as well as oscillation and capture orbits .",
    "simo and martinez @xcite apply analytical and numerical tools to study homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits which connect triple collisions to infinity , and use homothetic solutions to obtain a characterization of the orbits which pass near triple collision . in @xcite",
    "elbialy uses ( rather than the kinetic mass matrix norm ) the euclidian norm to perform a mcgehee - type change of coordinates in order to discuss the flow behavior near the collision manifold as the ratio between the @xmath10 in a recent study , mitsuru and kazuyuri @xcite deduce numerically the existence of infinite families of relative periodic orbits .",
    "the first part of our study follows classical methodology : we write the hamiltonian , use the rotational symmetry to reduce the system , and obtain the reduced hamiltonian as a sum of the kinetic energy and the reduced ( amended ) potential .",
    "the internal parameters are the energy @xmath11 and the total angular momentum @xmath12 .",
    "we retrieve the relative equilibria , that is , solutions where the three mass points are steadily rotating about their common centre of mass , and discuss their stability modulo rotations .",
    "recall that in the newtonian three body problem there are two classes of relative equilibria ( up to a homothety ) : the lagrangian ones , where the three mass points form an equilateral triangle and the rotation axis is perpendicular to the plane determined by the mass points ; and the eulerian ones , where the mass points are in a collinear configuration and the axis of rotation is perpendicular to the line of the mass points at the centre of mass . for certain mass ratios the lagrangian relative equilibria are linearly stable , whereas the eulerian relative equilibria are always unstable . in the isosceles problem , since the axis of rotation is perpendicular to the line of the equal masses at their centre of mass , one retrieves only the eulerian relative equilibria , which are still unstable , even when considered only in the invariant manifold of isosceles motions . in the schwarzschild isosceles problem",
    "we find no relative equilibria for small angular momenta . for angular momenta larger than a critical value , we find two distinct eulerian relative equilibria : one unstable , similar to the newtonian case , and one stable modulo rotations about the vertical axis .",
    "this is the case even if @xmath13 is small , that is when schwarzschild may be considered as a perturbation of the newtonian model .",
    "the second part of our study focusses on motions near collisions when @xmath14 a similar analysis may be performed for general ratios @xmath15 , which we expect would lead to similar conclusions , but we leave this for a future study . by using a mcgehee - type transformation ( similar as in @xcite )",
    "we introduce coordinates which regularize the flow at triple collisions .",
    "the triple collision singularity appears as a manifold pasted into the phase space for all levels of energy and angular momenta .",
    "this manifold contains fictitious dynamics which is used to draw conclusions about the motions near , and/or leading to , triple collisions . in our case ,",
    "the triple collision manifold is not closed and has two edges which correspond to triple collisions attained through motions in which the equal masses are a black - hole type binary collision and the third mass @xmath8 is on one side of the vertical axis ( see figure [ orbitas13 ] ) . the condition @xmath16 insures the presence of six equilibria on the triple collision manifold , three corresponding to orbits which begin on the manifold , called _ ejection _ orbits , and three which end on it , called _ collision _ orbits .",
    "we analyse the flow on the triple collision manifold , including the stability of equilibria , and we deduce that on every energy level the set of initial conditions ejecting from or leading to triple collision has positive lebesgue measure . we also find a condition over the set of parameters so that certain orbit connections are satisfied .",
    "it is important to remark that one of the main differences between the newtonian and schwarzschild isosceles problem at triple collisions is that in the latter the _ binary collisions do not regularize as elastic bounces _ , but as one dimensional invariant manifolds .",
    "this is not surprising , taking into account previous results on the two body collision in the problem with non - gravitational interactions ( see @xcite ; also @xcite )",
    ".    it would be interesting to adapt the mcgehee - type transformation used by elbialy @xcite to the context of schwarzschild problem .",
    "we reckon that this would allow the analysis of the flow at collision for both @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( i.e. , @xmath19 ) and that , similarly to in the newtonian case , the collision manifold will have different topologies for non - zero and zero mass ratios .",
    "however , taking into account the remark in the paragraph above , it is hard to predict if other similarities would occur when about the discussion of the near - collision flow .",
    "we defer this problem to a future investigation .",
    "we continue by studying homographic solutions and , implicitly , central configurations . by definition ,",
    "solution for a @xmath5 mass - point system is a solution along which the geometric configuration of the mass points is similar to the initial geometric configuration .",
    "there are two extreme cases of homographic motion : if the motion of the mass points is a steady rotation , then the solution is in fact a relative equilibrium ; and if the mass points evolve on straight lines through the common centre of mass , then the solution is called _",
    "homothetic_. the geometric configuration ( within its similarity class ) of the points of a homographic solution",
    "is called a _ central configuration _ if at all times the position vectors are parallel to the acceleration vectors .",
    "it can be shown that , for rotationally - invariant potentials , there are only two instances where central configurations are possible : either the mass points are in a relative equilibrium , or they are homothetic .",
    "central configurations play an important role in understanding @xmath5-body systems .",
    "excellent references for this subject can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for the newtonian problem , the mass points tend to such central configurations as they approach total collisions ; it is worth to mention that an outstanding open problem is the finiteness of central configurations in the newtonian @xmath5-body problem ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we show that for the schwarzschild isosceles problem , homographic motions are confined to the horizontal plane and with @xmath8 resting at @xmath7 for all times . in particular , the only central configurations are given by the eulerian relative equilibria and the ( collinear ) homothetic motions .",
    "this is in agreement with the analysis of central configurations for the three - body problem with generalized schwarzschild interaction presented by arredondo et al . in @xcite .",
    "@xmath20    finally we analyse motions near triple collisions .",
    "we discuss the asymptotic ( limiting ) geometric configurations of the solutions corresponding to the ejection / collision orbits as they depart from or tend to triple collision . in the newtonian problem",
    ", such limiting configurations are associated to a central configurations as the solutions corresponding to the ejection / collision orbits are homothetic .",
    "we prove that this is not the case in the generic schwarzschild problem .",
    "( the non - generic case is given by condition ( [ generic_pot ] ) .",
    "see also section [ hom_sol ] . )",
    "moreover , there are limiting triangular configurations which are not even associated to homographic solutions . to our knowledge , this is the first time when such  non - homographic \" configurations are observed to be limiting configurations at triple collision .",
    "we further remark that on any energy level , the set of initial conditions leading to triple collision with a limiting geometric configuration of a homographic solution is of positive lebesgue measure .",
    "these solutions correspond to motions starting / ending in triple collision where mass @xmath8 on the vertical axis crosses the horizontal plane infinitely many times before collision ( i.e. , @xmath8 oscillates about the centre of mass of the binary equal mass system ) .",
    "the set of initial conditions leading to triple collision with a non - degenerate non - homographic triangular limiting configuration is of zero lebesgue measure . in all cases , whenever the angular momentum is not zero , collisions are attained while the equal masses perform black - hole type motions .",
    "we end by proving that for negative energies , there is an open set of initial conditions for which solutions end in double ( i.e. , the collision of the equal masses while @xmath8 is above or below the horizontal plane ) or in triple collisions with @xmath8 crossing the horizontal plane a finite number of times .",
    "our study emphasizes the differences between the newtonian and the schwarzschild model .",
    "our findings are summarized in table [ table ] .",
    "as mentioned , one of the most important dissimilarities concerns the approach to total collapse .",
    "besides the presence of the black hole effect , the schwarzschild problem displays asymptotic total collision trajectories which are not homographic ; in particular , this implies that there exist asymptotic geometric configurations at triple collision which are not central configurations .    to put these conclusions in context",
    ", we note that given the presence of the `` strong - force '' @xmath21 term in the schwarzschild potential which dominates at small distances , leads to the expectation that black hole effects near collisions are present ( see also @xcite ) ; initially , the main goal of this study was to prove this for three mass point interactions .",
    "the existence of the non - homographic triple collisions orbits is due to the non - homogeneity of the potential , as it is given by a sum of two homogeneous terms which are taken in a",
    " generic \" position ( see section [ v_and_w ] ) .",
    "related work was performed on the three - body problem with quasi - homogeneous interaction , a generalization of the schwarzschild potential of the form @xmath22 @xmath23 .",
    "diacu @xcite found that in the quasi - homogeneous three body problem , the set of collision orbits form asymptotically _ quasi - central configurations _ , that is , geometric configurations of orbits which are homographic only with respect to the term @xmath24 of the potential . in @xcite ,",
    "diacu et al . studied the so - called _ simultaneous central configuration _ for quasi - homogeneous interactions ; these are central configurations arising in the non - generic case ( see equation ( [ generic_pot ] ) ) which we do not consider here .",
    "perez - chavela et al .",
    "@xcite studied the collinear quasi - homogeneous three body problem ( it is assumed that there is no rotation ) and proved that the set of initial conditions leading to triple collision has positive lebesgue measure . in the same paper the authors show that there are triple collision orbits which are not asymptotic to a central configuration , but these orbits do not originate / terminate in a fixed point on the collision manifold .",
