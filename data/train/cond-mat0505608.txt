    "the pseudogap phase has been widely regarded as an essential integral part of the cuprate superconductors with extensive experimental support.timusk the underlying physics of such a phase has been a central focus in the study of high-@xmath0 problem for many years , and yet no consensus has been reached concerning its nature due to the very complexity of pseudogap phenomena observed in magnetic , transport , single - particle , and optical channels .",
    "more and more experimental evidence in recent years further indicates the existence of two kinds of pseudogap regimes at different temperatures.@xcite    among various theoretical proposals for the pseudogap phase , the rvb idea @xcite is uniquely interesting , which actually predicted  @xcite the existence of a pseudogap state in doped mott insulators before experiment . in the rvb picture ,",
    "neutral spins form the singlet pairs that are condensed as a spin liquid .",
    "the density of states of spin excitations for such a system generally gets suppressed at low energy , exhibiting a pseudogap feature as it costs energy to break up the rvb pairs to create spin excitations . in such a scenario , there is usually no gap in the pure charge degrees of freedom , and the pseudogap phenomena observed in the charge transport , angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) , and tunnelling experiments , are all indirectly attributed to the appearance of the _ spin _ gap in the spin degrees of freedom.@xcite for instance , in the charge transport the strong scattering between the charge carriers and low - lying spin fluctuations becomes weakened because of the reduction of the latter in the pseudogap regime ; the pseudogap feature exhibited in the arpes and tunnelling measurements may be also interpreted as due to the opening of a pseudogap associated with the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "however , the original rvb description , known as the fermionic rvb ( f - rvb ) since it involves the pairing of _ fermionic _ spinons  ( neutral @xmath7 object),@xcite also suffers some notable inconsistency with the experiment . note that the pseudogap phenomenon has been found in the underdoped regime of the cuprates @xcite where the antiferromagnetic ( af ) correlations are usually quite strong . but in an f - rvb description , the af correlations remain intrinsically weak , even at half - filling , where the af long range order ( aflro ) develops in the cuprates at low temperature . here the key issue is not about whether one can construct an aflro in the rvb background , which may be easy to incorporate by a simple mean - field order parameter.hsu,muthu but the crucial and highly nontrivial issue is whether the _ whole _ low - lying af spin correlations are intrinsically and sufficiently strong in an rvb state @xcite , and whether they are capable of continuously _ growing _ with reducing temperature or doping as has been clearly manifested experimentally in , say , the nmr spin - lattice relaxation rates ( see the analysis in refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "since the pseudogap phase , which involves high - energy / temperature and short distance physics , may be properly considered as an unstable fixed point state @xcite with intrinsic instabilities towards aflro or d - wave superconductivity at low temperatures , the importance of its correct description , with regard to the latter , is like that of a fermi liquid with regard to the bcs superconducting state .",
    "in other words , finding an accurate and correct description of the pseudogap phase will be rather important for constructing a sensible low - energy theory for describing the low - temperature af and superconducting phases in the cuprates .    in this paper",
    ", we show that there does exist a desirable candidate for characterizing the pseudogap phase based on the rvb picture , in which strong af correlations are present as an _ intrinsic _ and _ predominant _ feature .",
    "such an rvb state , known as the bosonic rvb ( b - rvb ) state , psmfd differs from the usual f - rvb states by that it works very well at half - filling in describing the af correlations over a wide range of temperature , including zero temperature where an aflro naturally emerges .",
    "[ fp ] schematically illustrates the global phase diagram for such a b - rvb theory,@xcite where an _ upper _ pseudogap phase ( upp ) below the characteristic temperature @xmath6 is characterized by the formation of singlet pairing of neutral spins as denoted by the b - rvb order parameter @xmath8 as illustrated by fig .",
    "1 , the low - temperature phases , including a _ lower _ pseudogap phase below @xmath5 ( also known as the spontaneous vortex phase @xcite ) , a d - wave superconducting phase at @xmath9 beyond a critical doping concentration @xmath10 , and an aflro phase near half - filling , can all be regarded as the results of the low - temperature instabilities from such an upp.@xcite     at @xmath11 whose properties are the main focus of this paper .",
    "the antiferromagnetic ordered phase ( af ) , the lower pseudogap phase at @xmath12 , and the superconducting phase ( sc ) at @xmath13 all happen on top of this upp at low doping.,width=288 ]    the main focus of the present work will be the nature of the upp itself .",
    "we will examine the detailed behavior of uniform spin susceptibility , spin - lattice relaxation rates , and spin - echo decay rate based on the b - rvb theory , which will reveal that , as one enters the upp from above @xmath6 , the spin correlations change qualitatively . at the mean - field level",
    ", localized spins are essentially uncorrelated at @xmath14 , resulting in a curie - weiss - like behavior in the uniform spin susceptibility .",
    "below @xmath6 , however , finite - range spin correlations start to develop , predominantly around the af momentum @xmath15 , with the weight being transferred from the momentum @xmath16 .",
    "the latter effect leads to the reduction of uniform susceptibility at @xmath17 .",
    "we show that such magnetic behavior in the upp is quite consistent with the experimental measurements in the cuprates .",
    "the above results clearly indicate that the upp corresponds to a crossover from a weakly correlated localized spin system at higher temperature into a strongly _ af _",
    "correlated spin liquid at lower temperature .",
    "this picture is thus in sharp contrast to the f - rvb picture of the pseudogap , where the low - energy spin excitations , either around @xmath18 or @xmath19 , _ all _ get suppressed with the opening of the pseudogap .",
    "this latter behavior rather resembles the lower pseudogap phase of the b - rvb theory at @xmath12 ( in ref .",
    "@xcite it is simply called the pseudogap phase ) than the upp .",
    "but even the distinction between the pseudogap state of the f - rvb theory and such a lower pseudogap state of the b - rvb theory is very significant as has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite : the former is exchange energy driven while the latter is kinetic energy driven . here",
    "the lower pseudogap phase corresponds to the formation of cooper pair amplitude but is short of superconducting phase coherence , which exists between @xmath5 and @xmath0 and can be regarded as a vortex liquid state.@xcite it was previously pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that such a spontaneous vortex phase should coincide with the experimentally discovered nernst region @xcite in the high-@xmath0 cuprates .",
    "the quantitative phase diagram of the upp  is determined in the three - dimensional parameter space of temperature , doping concentration , and external magnetic field .",
    "the latter introduces the competition between the zeeman spin splitting and singlet spin pairing .",
    "the mean - field theory will predict a simple proportional relation between the critical  magnetic field @xmath20 , at which the upp is destroyed , and @xmath6 in zero field . a comparison with experiment will be made .",

    "7 ) , as opposed to the behavior in the upp , indicating the appearance of the spin gap over whole momenta . on the other hand , although the low - energy spin fluctuations are gapped , the static af spin - spin correlations as described by the real part of spin susceptibility function still remain , as reflected by @xmath169 shown in the right inset of fig . 7 , where the monotonic increase of @xmath169 in the upp ( fig .",
    "6 ) is replaced by the saturation at lower pseudogap phase .",
    "this feature has also been observed experimentally.@xcite",
    "in this paper , we have systematically analyzed the magnetic characterizations of a high - temperature _ intrinsic _ phase of the bosonic rvb state , which is described by the formation of the bosonic rvb order parameter at a temperature below the characteristic @xmath4 but still higher than those for low - temperature orders , including aflro and superconductivity , to emerge .",
    "such a phase exhibits the pseudogap features that match those of the upper pseudogap phase in the high-@xmath0 cuprate superconductors very well .",
    "the key feature in the crossover to the upp from above @xmath6 is the onset of the development of strong af spin - spin correlations , which remain rather weak at @xmath14 where the system resembles more an ensemble of uncorrelated localized spins .",
    "this explains why experimentally the uniform spin susceptibility shows an approximately curie - weiss behavior at @xmath178 reaches a peak at @xmath6 , and then gets reduces below @xmath6 as the weight of the spin - spin correlations at the momentum @xmath179 being transferred to @xmath180 , in contrast to an equal weight distribution above @xmath6 .",
    "it further explains why the spin - lattice relaxation rate gets enhanced for the planar copper nuclear spins whereas reduced for the planar oxygen nuclear spins below @xmath4 and why the spin - echo decay rate increases with the decreasing temperature ; clearly the development of the af correlations is the underlying mechanism here .",
    "we emphasize that the formation of spin singlet pairing and the onset of af correlations at the same time are not always true . in the f - rvb description of the slave - boson approach",
    ", the formation of the f - rvb order parameter actually leads to the reduction of the spin - lattice relaxation rates for both the copper and oxygen nuclear spins at low temperatures .",
    "this is because the spin pseudogap opens for both the ferromagnetic and af correlations .",
    "by contrast , this case occurs in the b - rvb description only at a lower temperature when the system enters the lower pseudogap regime , characterized by the formation of cooper pair amplitude in the so - called spontaneous vortex phase @xcite which is a vortex liquid state , short of superconducting phase coherence . a comparative study of this lower pseudogap phase in the b - rvb theory and the pseudogap phase in the f - rvb theory has been given in ref .",
    "@xcite where two opposite driving mechanisms : kinetic vs. superexchange energy driven , have been identified",
    ".    the phase diagram of the upp has been determined by a generalized mean - field  description in the b - rvb theory in the parameter space of temperature , doping , and magnetic field .",
    "since the upp essentially reflects the spin singlet pairing , the zeeman splitting competes directly , which results in a quantitative prediction for experiment as discussed in sec .",
    "ii b.    a central consequence of an rvb ( spin singlet ) description of the pseudogap phase is that the pseudogap represents the suppression of the low - lying spectral weight in spin excitations , but not in charge excitations , as pointed out in the introduction . in the following ,",
    "we briefly outline the scenario about what happens to the charge channel when one enters the upp in the bosonic rvb theory .",
    "we shall leave the more quantitative investigation in future work .    in order to see how the charge transport is affected by the spin fluctuations , we first note that in the b - rvb theory , the charge degrees of freedom ( holons ) are described by the following effective hamiltonian : psmfd@xmath181where the bosonic holons , created by @xmath182 , interact with the gauge field @xmath183 associated with the spin degrees of freedom . similar to the definition of the gauge field @xmath30 in eq.([ah ] ) , @xmath184 , which is introduced in the phase string representation ( see appendix a ) , satisfies    @xmath185    where @xmath32 is an arbitrary path .",
    "physically @xmath183 describes @xmath186 flux tubes bound to @xmath187(@xmath188 ) spinons as seen by holons .",
    "so at @xmath14 , uncorrelated localized spins imply a maximum scattering to the holons according to eqs.([hh ] ) and ( [ as ] ) . by forming the rvb pairing below @xmath6",
    ", one can easily understand that the fluctuations in @xmath184 will be effectively reduced , and so does the scattering to the holons according to eqs.([hh ] ) and ( [ as ] ) , leading to a pseudogap feature in the charge transport without involving a charge gap .",
    "note that when the temperature is further reduced to @xmath5 , where the holons gain the phase coherence and become bose condensed , the system enters the lower pseudogap phase ( spontaneous vortex phase ) in which the effect of the holon condensation will feedback to the spinon part via @xmath189 in eq.(hs ) and cause the lower pseudogap phenomenon in the spin part as discussed in sec .",
    "ii e. finally , the quasiparticle excitation can be regarded as a recombination of holon , spinon , and phase string , in the superconducting phase.@xcite it has been argued that the deconfinement occurs above @xmath190 , and the composite structure is expected to shows up in both the lower and upper pseudogap phases , and the pseudogap feature is thus believed to be associated with that in the spinon degrees of freedom .",
