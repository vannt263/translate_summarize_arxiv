    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) layered materials , where interlayer interactions are dominated by weak van der waals ( vdw ) forces , has attracted tremendous attention in nanoelectronics  @xcite .",
    "of particular interest are quantum confinement effects in which the electronic structure of the 2d layered material changes abruptly as a function of the number of layers .",
    "a well - known example is the indirect to direct band gap transition when 2d mos@xmath2 is reduced to a single layer  @xcite . here",
    ", we show that quantum confinement results in the emergence of an electrically tunable dirac cone in a recently discovered 2d material - 2d black phosphorus .",
    "black phosphorus , a layered semiconductor material , is the thermodynamically stable form of phosphorus .",
    "different experimental techniques , such as mechanical  @xcite and liquid  @xcite exfoliation , have been employed to thin down the bulk to a monolayer .",
    "experimentalists have succeeded also in measuring a thickness - dependent transport gap , ranging from @xmath30.30 ev ( bulk ) to 1.0 ev ( monolayer )  @xcite , and in fabricating field effect transistors based on ultrathin black phosphorus  @xcite .",
    "such transistors exhibit high mobility of @xmath4 and appreciably high on / off ratios , up to 10@xmath5 , opening up a possible potential application in nanoelectronics  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to previously studied 2d materials such as graphene and mos@xmath2 , 2d black phosphorus layers are highly anisotropic ( see figure 1 ) , with zigzag chains in one direction ( _ y _ in the figure ) and armchair chains in the other direction ( _ x _ ) .",
    "this anisotropy adds another dimension of interest to 2d materials , resulting in direction - dependent optical and transport properties  @xcite .",
    "is applied along @xmath6-axis and @xmath7 denotes the corresponding potential difference across the layers .",
    "@xmath8 is the potential difference between the two vertically inequivalent sites in each layer . for the sake of simplicity we use @xmath9 for our tight - binding model of the bilayer system . in ( a ) , hopping parameters of the tight - binding model are indicated .",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath11 denote intralayer and interlayer hopping parameters respectively . in ( b ) , dark and light yellow correspond to two different layers of black phosphorus.,width=302 ]        in this work , we explore from first principles calculations the effect of external electric fields applied perpendicular to thin films of black phosphorus . similar to the stark effect previously predicted for boron nitride nanotubes , two - dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides , and other 1d and 2d materials  @xcite we find that the electric field localizes the valence band maximum ( vbm ) and conduction band minimum ( cbm ) states at opposite surfaces of the slab .",
    "the resulting potential difference between the vbm and cbm states results in a decrease in the band gap , eventually leading to an insulator - to - metal transition at a critical applied field , @xmath1 .",
    "however , in contrast to other materials , we also find that for black phosphorus films below a certain critical thickness , a further increase in applied field strength results in a highly anisotropic opening in the band gap that leads to a formation of a dirac cone .",
    "this result is not observed for black phosphorus films that are too thick .",
    "we show that the emergent dirac cone physics arises from anisotropic interaction terms between the electric - field - induced quantum - confined vbm and cbm states in few layer black phosphorus .",
    "* electronic structure at zero @xmath12 * we begin our study by calculating the electronic structure of pristine black phosphorus at zero external electric field .",
    "electronic structure calculations are performed by using density functional theory ( dft ) within the perdew - burke - ernzerhof parametrization ( pbe )  @xcite of the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) of the exchange and correlation potential , as implemented in the _ quantum espresso _  @xcite package . to treat van der waals ( vdw ) interactions , we employ the vdw+df approach for the exchange - correlation functional  @xcite(see methods for further details ) .",
    "bulk black phosphorus has an orthorhombic crystal structure ; the optimized lattice parameters of bulk black phosphorus are @xmath13=3.35   , @xmath14=4.68   , and @xmath15=11.42   , in good agreement with the corresponding experimental values ( @xmath13=3.31  , @xmath14=4.37  , and @xmath15=10.47  )  @xcite .",
    "bulk black phosphorus is a semiconductor and we predict a direct band gap of 0.43 ev at the @xmath16 point .",
    "although this band gap value is slightly larger than the experimental value of 0.35 ev  @xcite , it is in good agreement with other vdw - corrected density functional theory calculations  @xcite . for thin film black phosphorus , we find that the structural parameters do not change significantly .",
    "on the other hand , the band gap increases monotonically with decreasing thickness , reaching 0.99 ev for the monolayer .",
    "interestingly , the band gap remains direct at the @xmath17 point when the thickness reduces from bulk to monolayer limit .",
    "as previously mentioned , black phosphorus is a layered compound consisting of puckered phosphorene layers with highly anisotropic bonding within each layer ( figure 1 ) .",
    "we denote multi - layered black phosphorus by @xmath18l - bp , where @xmath18 is the number of layers .",
    "[ fig : band - ldos](a ) shows the electronic structure of 4l - bp , which exhibits a direct band gap of 0.60 ev at the @xmath17 point .",
    "the valence band maximum ( vbm ) and conduction band minimum ( cbm ) charge density are both delocalized over the layers .",
    "our analysis of the projected density of states indicates that the charge density at the vbm and the cbm originate from phosphorus 3@xmath19 , 3@xmath20 and 3@xmath21 orbitals ( see supplementary figure s1 ) .",
    "the @xmath21 orbitals have the largest contribution ( @xmath22  70% ) to the vbm and cbm among all the orbitals .    , for 2l ( black circles ) , 3l ( red squares ) , 4l ( green triangles ) , 5l ( blue stars ) , 6l ( cyan triangles ) , 7l ( magenta diamonds ) , and 8l ( orange triangles ) -bp .",
    "inset : variation of the stark effect coefficient , @xmath23 , with number of layers .",
    "note that we consider the linear region of the band gap versus @xmath24 curve to compute @xmath23 , and the fitted linear part is indicated by the corresponding dashed line.,width=302 ]    * electronic structure for @xmath25 * we now discuss the response of the electronic structure of @xmath18l - bp to a static external electric field with magnitude @xmath0 , applied normal to the layers . as @xmath0 increases",
    ", the band gap decreases monotonically while remaining direct at @xmath17 , and eventually closes at a critical field , @xmath1 ( see figure  [ fig : band - ldos](b ) and figure  [ fig : bgvseext ] ) .",
    "this phenomenon essentially arises from the stark effect : the applied electric field lifts the degeneracy among distinct layers in the thin film .",
    "after the degeneracy is lifted , states that are localized in regions with higher potential will have a higher energy due to electrostatic interaction with the external field , while those localized in regions with lower potential will have a lower energy .",
    "consequently , the vbm becomes localized on the surface layer with higher potential , while the cbm becomes localized on the opposite surface layer with lower potential , resulting in a decrease in band gap .",
    "we note that , strictly speaking , the vbm and cbm states also have tails into the interior layers ( figure  [ fig : band - ldos](b - c ) ) .",
    "these tails are important for the vbm and cbm states to interact when they become energy degenerate at the critical field ( see later ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : bgvseext ] shows the modulation of band gap as a function of @xmath0 for different @xmath18l - bp , where @xmath18 runs from 2 to 8 .",
    "we find that the bandgap reduces very rapidly with @xmath0 as the thickness gets larger .",
    "such a thickness dependence can be easily understood by considering the potential drop across the layers . if one simply assumes that the potential drops linearly across the layers , a larger thickness requires a smaller electric field to sustain the same potential difference between the two edges .",
    "furthermore , the band gap at zero field also decreases with increasing thickness . as such , the magnitude of the critical field , @xmath1 , decreases with thickness .",
    "indeed we observe that the value of @xmath1 drops to 0.29 ev /  for 8l - bp . in practice",
    ", the potential drop is not strictly linear in space due to screening within the layers ; however , an analysis of the screening effect shows that the potential drop in the interlayer region is much larger than that in the intralayer region , and the average potential in each layer drops linearly across the layers  ( see supplementary figure s2 ) .",
    "we quantify the above analysis as follows . under the assumption that the potential drops linearly across the layers , the external field , @xmath0 , induces a potential difference , @xmath26 , which can be expressed as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the dielectric constant along the direction of the applied field and @xmath29 is defined as @xmath30 . here",
    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 denote the center positions ( along the @xmath6-axis ) of the localised vbm and cbm states , respectively  @xcite .",
    "since the vbm and cbm localize at opposite surfaces for large @xmath0 , @xmath33c@xmath34 , where @xmath15 is the layer - layer distance and @xmath35 is the position of @xmath36 from the surfaces  @xcite .",
    "we note that we are assuming here that @xmath35 is independent of the applied field and film thickness . although this is not likely to be valid , deviations should be small compared to @xmath29 . under this model ,",
    "we can write the change in band gap , @xmath37 , as follows : @xmath38 in general for the critical field , @xmath1 , we obtain from equation  [ gap ] that @xmath39 indeed , we find that @xmath40 versus @xmath18 is approximately linear ( see supplementary figure s3 ) , with deviations resulting from the assumption that @xmath35 is constant .    in the initial response to @xmath0 ,",
    "the band gap varies non - linearly ( likely quadratic ) with @xmath0 , and the slope of the curve vanishes at @xmath41 ( figure 3 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the variation in band gap should be independent of the polarity of the applied field , so that in this low field regime , the above linear analysis breaks down .",
    "however , for larger electric fields , for instance @xmath42/@xmath1 ) >  0.1 for a specific thickness , @xmath37 is an approximately linear function of @xmath0 ( figure  [ fig : bgvseext ] ) and this linear slope can be described as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the electron charge and @xmath45 is defined as the linear giant stark effect ( gse ) coefficient . combining equation  [ gap ] with equation  [ stark1 ] ,",
    "the gse coefficient can be written as @xmath46 indeed , the inset of figure  [ fig : bgvseext ] shows that the stark coefficient increases approximately linearly as a function of the number of layers .        at the critical field ,",
    "the system becomes metallic when the vbm and cbm touch at @xmath17 .",
    "unlike the electrically driven stoner magnetism previously reported for mos@xmath2 nanoribbons  @xcite , there is no spin polarization in this system ( supplementary figure s4 ) .",
    "this is because the density of states at the fermi level is much smaller in the 2d system than in the 1d nanoribbons .",
    "* electronic structure beyond critical field * an interesting and unique effect is observed in very thin - layer bps ( for example in 4l - bp ) , when an electric field larger than the critical field is applied .",
    "specifically , a dirac cone appears at a @xmath47-point along @xmath17-y , which we shall call @xmath48 , as shown in figure  [ fig : band - ldos](c ) and figure  [ fig : diraccone](a - b ) .",
    "the valence band manifold and conduction band manifold touch at exactly two points , @xmath49 , in the 2d brillouin zone [ figure  [ fig : diraccone](a ) ] . by plotting the charge density of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied states at k - points close to the dirac point(see supplementary figure s5 )",
    ", we see that the bands are inverted at the dirac point , indicating that we have a new topological phase .",
    "as black phosphorus films exhibit a direct band gap even in the presence of the external electric fields , the band inversion in itself may not be too surprising .",
    "however , the fact that the valence and conduction band manifolds touch at only one point , the dirac point , is intriguing and deserves further analysis .    as @xmath0 increases beyond the critical value , the dirac point , @xmath48 , shifts progressively from @xmath17 toward y in the 2d brillouin zone [ figure  [ fig : diraccone](b ) ]",
    "this shifts occurs simultaneously with an enhancement of the corresponding dirac fermi velocity , @xmath50  [ figure  [ fig : diraccone](c ) ] .",
    "the existence of the dirac point is associated with an asymmetry between the @xmath17-y and @xmath17-x directions - so that the valence and conduction bands touch only at the dirac points and not in a ring in the 2d brillouin zone ; neither does a band gap open up throughout the 2d brillouin zone .",
    "we quantify this asymmetry and therefore also the robustness of the dirac electronic structure by the band gap along @xmath17-x , @xmath51 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : diraccone](c ) , @xmath51 increases initially as @xmath0 increases beyond the critical field ; however , as @xmath0 continues to increase , @xmath51 decreases . for 4l - bp",
    ", @xmath51 reaches a maximum value of @xmath339 mev at @xmath0=0.72 v /   , where the corresponding @xmath52-components of @xmath53 are 0.84@xmath54 and 0.56@xmath55 m / s , respectively .",
    "these fermi velocities are as large as the predicted value of @xmath56 m / s in graphene  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , we find that the maximum value of @xmath51 reduces to 8 mev when the thickness of black phosphorus increases to 8l [ figure  [ fig : diraccone](c ) ] , and vanishes for the 12l case  ( see supplementary figure s6 ) .",
    "salient features that arise from the above analysis are that @xmath51 can not be arbitrarily increased with electric field strength , and that @xmath51 is smaller for thicker black phosphorus films .",

    ", width=302 ]    to understand the above intriguing phenomena , we develop a simple tight - binding model that captures the essential physics of black phosphorus thin films in the presence of an external electric field .",
    "* tight - binding model * for simplicity we consider a tight - binding model for bp films that are two - layer thick ( bilayer bp ) .",
    "since we are concerned with the valence band ( vb ) and conduction band ( cb ) which stem from @xmath21 orbitals , we include only @xmath21 orbitals in our model . in the presence of large external electric fields , the vb and cb are mainly localized at the opposite surface layers of the thin film ; therefore , the bilayer model can effectively also represent the vb and cb electronic structure in thicker films .",
    "we begin with a standard tight - binding hamiltonian : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the energy of @xmath70-th site , @xmath71 is the potential shift at the @xmath70-th site upon the applied vertical field ( see figure  [ fig : structure ] ) , @xmath72(@xmath73 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of electrons at site @xmath74 , and @xmath75 and @xmath76 are respectively the intralayer and interlayer inter - site hopping integrals as depicted in figure  [ fig : structure ] . in the first instance , we include hopping terms up to the fourth and fifth nearest neighbor for the interlayer and intralayer interactions respectively , using the parameters reported previously in ref .  @xcite .",
    "this provides an accurate description of the vb and cb , as given by the @xmath77 approximation .",
    "figure  [ fig : tb](a ) shows that our model nicely reproduces the band dispersion of the vb and cb in comparison with that of the @xmath77 bands  @xcite .    when an external field is applied , the on - site energy of each site , @xmath69 , is rigidly shifted by the corresponding potential difference , @xmath71 ( see figure  [ fig : structure ] ) . for small @xmath71",
    "[ figure  [ fig : tb](a ) ] we see that the band gap closes as described above .",
    "when @xmath71 increases above a critical value , @xmath78 , the dirac cone emerges along the @xmath17-y direction , just as was predicted by dft , with the position of the dirac cone shifting with the size of @xmath78 ( figure  [ fig : tb](b ) , green and magenta curves ) .",
    "however , interestingly , when the interlayer interaction terms @xmath11 are set to zero , @xmath79 causes the band gap to vanish all over the two - dimensional brillouin zone  ( figure  [ fig : tb](b ) , cyan curve ) .",
    "this finding indicates that the interlayer interaction is critical to the emergence of a dirac cone .",
    "intuitively , we expect the vb and cb states to interact via these interlayer terms , since the states are localized at opposite surfaces of the thin film .",
    "the opening of a band gap everywhere in the brillouin zone except along @xmath17-y thus results from interactions between the vb and cb states , mediated by the interlayer hopping integrals .",
    "this also explains why the maximum value of @xmath51 decreases as the thickness of the bp film increases and the interactions between the vb and cb become smaller .",
    "thus , while the critical field @xmath1 may become smaller with thicker films due to a decrease in the band gap with increasing thickness , the dirac cone phenomenon will be absent beyond a critical thickness even with gap closure .",
    "we find that within dft , when the film thickness increases to 12l , @xmath51 becomes negligible ( equal to the precision of our calculations)(see supplementary figure s6 ) .",
    "quantum confinement is therefore important for the dirac cone phenomenon .     point .",
    "black and red lines denote the bandstructure calculated without and with spin - orbit coupling , respectively , at @xmath0 = ( a ) 0.56 , ( b ) 0.61 and ( c ) 0.66 v / .,width=302 ]    the unique dirac cone band structure implies also that for @xmath79 , there is no interaction between the vb and cb states along the @xmath17-y direction , but non - zero interactions along all other directions .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the anisotropic interlayer interactions in black phosphorus . indeed , as shown in figure  [ fig : tb](c ) , the @xmath47-dependent hamiltonian overlap matrix elements between the vb and cb states are highly anisotropic , going to zero along @xmath80 , i.e. along the @xmath17-y direction , but non - zero elsewhere in the brillouin zone .    from figure  [",
    "fig : tb](c ) , we can also see that for a fixed electric field strength , the interaction between the vb and cb states increases as we move along @xmath17-x away from the @xmath17 point . as the electric field strength",
    "is increased , the vb and cb cross further away from @xmath17 .",
    "this explains why @xmath51 initially increases as @xmath0 is increased [ figure  [ fig : diraccone](c ) ] .",
    "however , a larger electric field strength also implies greater localization of the vb and cb states , and therefore a smaller overall interaction term .",
    "these two effects compete with each other , resulting in an initial increase and then a subsequent decrease of @xmath51 as @xmath0 increases [ figure  [ fig : diraccone](c ) ] .",
    "thus , we have shown that the dirac cone phenomenon arising for @xmath81 stems from a combination of quantum confinement and anisotropy effects in black phosphorus .     for different values of @xmath57 in v /  .",

    "the band gap does not change significantly by the inclusion of spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) .",
    "however , the role of soc becomes preeminent when @xmath81 .",
    "interestingly , figure  [ fig : wsoc](a ) shows that the dirac cone is gapped out in the band structure by including the soc , which demonstrates that the system is likely to be a quantum spin hall insulator .",
    "the prediction can be explicitly confirmed by calculating the @xmath84 topological invariant of the system  @xcite , as shown in ref  @xcite . for 4l - bp ,",
    "the maximum soc - induced gap - opening at the dirac point is as large as 3 mev at @xmath0= 0.56 v /  .",
    "when @xmath0 is further increased , the soc - induced gap decreases ( to 2mev at @xmath0= 0.61 v /  ) and subsequently , the dirac semimetal phase appears at @xmath0=0.66 v /   along the @xmath17-y direction ( figure  [ fig : wsoc ] ) .",
    "thus , the external electric field can be used to tune the opening and closure of the gap along @xmath17-y when soc is included .",
    "it is interesting to mention that the band inversion is controlled by electrically driven band overlap between the vb and cb , unlike other topological insulators , for example bi@xmath2se@xmath85 , where band inversion is caused by spin - orbit coupling .    *",
    "robustness of results against functional * our results above are robust against the exact choice of functional . specifically , with the pbe functional , the band gap also decreases monotonically with thickness ( see supplementary figure s7 ) , but the rate of reduction of the pbe - bandgap is different from that of the vdw - corrected one .",
    "however , the qualitative physics , i.e. both the thickness - dependent bandgap , and the external field induced bandgap - closure and dirac cone , consistently appear regardless of the functional .",

    "<S> * abstract *    2d materials are well - known to exhibit interesting phenomena due to quantum confinement . here </S>",
    "<S> , we show that quantum confinement , together with structural anisotropy , result in an electric - field - tunable dirac cone in 2d black phosphorus . using density functional theory calculations , we find that an electric field , @xmath0 , applied normal to a 2d black phosphorus thin film , can reduce the direct band gap of few - layer black phosphorus , resulting in an insulator - to - metal transition at a critical field , @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> increasing @xmath0 beyond @xmath1 can induce a dirac cone in the system , provided the black phosphorus film is sufficiently thin . </S>",
    "<S> the electric field strength can tune the position of the dirac cone and the dirac - fermi velocities , the latter being similar in magnitude to that in graphene . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the dirac cone arises from an anisotropic interaction term between the frontier orbitals that are spatially separated due to the applied field , on different halves of the 2d slab . </S>",
    "<S> when this interaction term becomes vanishingly small for thicker films , the dirac cone can no longer be induced . </S>",
    "<S> spin - orbit coupling can gap out the dirac cone at certain electric fields ; however , a further increase in field strength reduces the spin - orbit - induced gap , eventually resulting in a topological - insulator - to - dirac - semi - metal transition . </S>"
