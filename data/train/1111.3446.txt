    "moreover , the partition function of the pnjl model at imaginary chemical potential has been shown @xcite to have the same periodicity in @xmath1 as that of qcd , @xmath19 , which was pointed out by roberge and weiss @xcite as a remnant of @xmath6 symmetry .",

    ". the chiral condensate @xmath32 serves as an order parameter for the chiral phase transition .",
    "the order parameters are determined by the minimum of the potential which is obtained by solving the gap equation @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",

    "( [ eq : omega ] ) for small @xmath38 , we have a gap equation at small @xmath39 limit in which only a term proportional to @xmath40 remains with a small magnitude @xmath41 indicating the statistical confinement .",
    "this dependence naturally leads to the periodicity @xmath36 when @xmath39 is negligible and chiral symmetry is broken . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath42 , the model reduces to the njl model except for the coupling of @xmath43 with @xmath35 , as seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq : omega ] ) . in this case , the apparent @xmath35 dependence is governed by @xmath44 as a consequence of deconfinement . although this factor does not match with the required periodicity @xmath36 , it is preserved by a change of @xmath43 , namely , the roberge - weiss transition .",
    "we show the chiral condensate in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma ] obtained by numerically solving the gap equations .",
    "one sees that @xmath32 at low temperature ( @xmath45 mev ) exhibits small and smooth variation as a function of @xmath35 , as discussed above . on the other hand",

    "this can be also understood from the gap equation for @xmath32 , since @xmath50 is replaced by @xmath51 for real @xmath2 .    while the above properties are independnent of the choice of @xmath7 , there are some potential dependent features as follows . in fig .  [ fig : sigma ] and the left of fig .  [ fig : moduls_target ] , one sees a discontinuity in the order parameters at the same @xmath35 .",
    "this shows a first order deconfinement transition which exists only in the case of the logarithmic potential ( [ eq : ulog ] ) .",
    "the polynomial potential ( [ eq : upol ] ) exhibits smoother change near phase transition . in the right of fig .",
    "[ fig : moduls_target ] , the target space of the polyakov loop is displayed .",
    "owing to the @xmath6 symmetry , @xmath7 has three degenerate minima at @xmath52 . putting quarks into the system makes one of those minima favored .",
    "while @xmath53 is always chosen at @xmath54 , @xmath55 is favored at imaginary chemical potential due to the coupling of @xmath35 and @xmath43 seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq : omega ] ) . at low temperature where minimum of @xmath7 is close to the origin ,",
    "the minimum of the effective potential smoothly moves from @xmath56 to @xmath57 across @xmath46 . at high temperature",
    ", however , there is a potential wall which makes the transition from point a to point b discontinuous . since the polynomial potential does not have any restriction of the target space , the minimum passes outside ( c ) the target space near the rw transition .",
    "the phase diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd ] summarize the behavior of the order parameters .",
    "one sees a first order deconfinement transition and an associated critical endpoint ( cep ) only for the logarithmic potential .",
    "this also implies that the rw endpoint , where the first order rw transition terminates , is a triple point . on the other hand",
    ", one sees a second order rw endpoint for the polynomial potential .",
    "the properties of the rw endpoint in qcd might reflect the nature of the qcd phase transition at real @xmath2 we refer to refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite for recent calculations of @xmath58 and @xmath59 latttice qcd , respectively .",
    "especially it should be noted that the order of the rw endpoint has a non - trivial bare quark mass dependence which can not be reproduced by chiral effective models .",
    "( see sec .",
    "[ sec : cep ] ) an improved model was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to reproduce this property .",
    "it has been shown that information on the deconfinement is encoded in @xmath35 dependence of @xmath32 .",
    "we can consider dual parameters which characterize the deconfinement transition .",
    "a dual parameter was introduced in @xcite . by considering a twisted boundary condition for quarks @xmath60 , one may define the corresponding chiral condensate @xmath61",
    ". then the dual chiral condensate @xmath62 reads @xmath63\\right\\rangle                               \\right]\\ ] ] while the twisted boundary condition is similar to introducing imaginary chemical potential @xcite , it does not apply to the background gauge field .",
    "therefore , @xmath61 has a periodicity @xmath64 and was calculated in a pnjl model by fixing the polyakov loop at its @xmath54 value @xcite .",
    "particularly @xmath65 is called dressed polyakov loop , since it has the same transformation properties under @xmath6 and thus is expected to serve as an order parameter of the deconfinement transition .",
    "analogously , we consider a modified dual parameter which utilizes the characteristic property of @xmath66 , @xmath67 where we take the integration range @xmath68 $ ] , owing to the periodicity of @xmath66 .    we compare those dual parameters for @xmath69 with the polyakov loop in fig .",
    "[ fig : dual ] , as well as their derivatives with respect to temperature , of which peaks can be regarded as ( pseudo)critical temperatures .",
    "one sees that while dual parameters show a rapid increase as seen in the polyakov loop ( top ) , and 1 as @xmath70 @xcite . ]",
    "their derivatives exhibit different peak structures .",
    "the derivatives of the dual parameters have a peak at the chiral transition temperature , independent of @xmath7 . as for the deconfinement , however , existence of the peak depends on @xmath7 .",
    "the dressed polyakov loop exhibits a peak for the @xmath71 for which @xmath39 shows stronger crossover than @xmath72 .",
    "moreover , the modified dual parameter exhibits only a shoulder even for @xmath71 .",
    "this result indicates different sensitivity of the dual parameters to the chiral and deconfinement transition .",
    "now let us turn to the deconfinement cep found in the case of @xmath71 . here",
    "we vary the four - fermion coupling constant @xmath73 to preserve the chiral symmetry in the lagrangian .",
    "locations of the cep are shown in the left of fig .",
    "[ fig : deccep ] for various values of @xmath73 .",
    "one sees the squared critical chemical potential @xmath74 increases with @xmath73 to reach @xmath75 around @xmath76 gev@xmath28 . in the right of fig .",
    "[ fig : deccep ] , we also depict a phase diagram for @xmath77 gev@xmath28 in which the cep exists at real chemical potential .",
    "one sees that the first order deconfinement transition starting from the rw endpoint ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pd ] ) is prolonged , while the chiral critical line moves upward .",
    "the relation between these two changes can be understood as follows . since the polyakov loop potential @xmath71 has a first order phase transition at @xmath78 , the model results in the same transition when the effects of quarks are negligible in thermodynamics .",
    "the contribution of quarks to thermodynamic potential is essentially determined by the dynamical quark mass @xmath25 , not by the current quark mass @xmath79 , as seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq : omega ] ) .",
    "when dynamical quark mass becomes lighter around @xmath78 , the deconfinement transition is modified to a crossover one .",
    "as @xmath73 increases , the stronger coupling leads to a larger condensate @xmath80 thus the dynamical quark mass becomes heavier .",
    "this appears as the modified chiral critical line in the phase diagram at @xmath77 gev@xmath28 and the resultant dynamical quark mass is heavy enough to recover the first order the deconfinement transition . at the reference value of @xmath73",
    ", the imaginary chemical potential weakens the thermal terms by @xmath50 in the thermodynamic potential thus resembling a heavier quark mass which yields the cep and a first order transition .",
    "while the above consideration is completely independent of the form of @xmath7 , quantitative features such as the value of dynamical quark mass which makes the transition first order depend on the choice of @xmath7 .",
    "figure [ fig : polgs ] shows the behavior of @xmath39 for various @xmath73 at vanishing chemical potential .",
    "one sees that @xmath39 becomes steeper for larger @xmath73 in both of @xmath7 .",
    "the case of @xmath71 has a discontinuity already at @xmath77 gev@xmath28 as mentioned above .",
    "@xmath81 , which has a smoother variation of @xmath39 against @xmath49 , eventually approaches the pure gauge case for much larger @xmath73 . at @xmath82 gev@xmath28 , where the dynamical quark mass at @xmath83 is around 2.5 gev",
    ", the first order deconfinement transition is recovered .",
    "the origin of this difference is the much weaker first order transition in @xmath72 , which easily turns into crossover when quarks heavier than 2.5 gev are put into the system .",
    "if one characterizes a strength of the deconfinement transition by a gap of the polyakov loop @xmath84 at @xmath78 , one finds @xmath85 for @xmath71 and 0.072 for @xmath72 .",
    "since @xmath73 determines the scale of the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking , @xmath86 , this result indicates an interplay of the two transitions which have a unique scale , @xmath87 , in the case of qcd .",
    "it has been shown that a first order deconfinement phase transition also emerges in the large @xmath88 limit of the pnjl model @xcite .",
    "this result has a common origin with the present study in a sense that taking large @xmath88 limit makes the system gluon dominated due to @xmath89 suppression of the quark contribution , while large @xmath73 thermally suppresses quarks in the chirally broken phase . in our case , however , chiral transition temperature moves upward thus there is a discrepancy between the deconfinement and chiral transition temperatures , in contrast to the large @xmath88 limit with a fixed @xmath90 in @xcite .",
    "we have explored the deconfinement transition in the pnjl model at imaginary chemical potential .",
    "we point out that the chiral condensate at imaginary chemical potential , @xmath66 , has a characteristic @xmath35 dependence due to the deconfinement property which naturally arises from the statistical confinement feature of the model .",
    "while the confined phase is characterized by a smooth @xmath40 dependence , the deconfined phase exhibits @xmath44 dependence together with cusps at @xmath46 ( mod @xmath36 ) induced by the abrupt change of the phase of the polyakov loop ( roberge - weiss transition ) .",
    "we introduce a new dual parameter utilizing this @xmath35 dependence and compare it with the polyakov loop and the dressed polyakov loop .",
    "different sensitivities of these parameters to chiral and deconfinement transitions are found . changing the four fermion coupling constant",
    ", we found that an interplay between the thermal quark contribution through the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and the polyakov loop potential determines the location of the deconfinement cep at imaginary chemical potential .",
    "in particular , we found that the deconfinement cep can be located in the real chemical potential regime for a polyakov loop potential with a strong first order transition and large dynamical chiral symmetry breaking .",
