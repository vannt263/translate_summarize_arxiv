    "it is known that properties of quantum spin systems tend to approach those of their corresponding classical spin systems as the spin magnitude increases . however , this is not necessarily the case for a sequence of models in which the number of multipolar - interaction terms increases as the spin magnitude increases .",
    "consequently the higher - spin systems may have stronger quantum effects in this case .",
    "in other words , such additional terms can break a classical correspondence down even in high dimensions .",
    "these `` large - spin - magnitude '' systems mentioned above include systems in which one unit has more than two degrees of freedom , such as orbitally degenerate systems@xcite . in such systems ,",
    "many coupling constants appear in general .",
    "however , experimental information about multipolar couplings is limited . as a starting point to explore such systems , understanding of one of the extreme limits",
    "must be useful .",
    "therefore in this paper , we investigate an su(@xmath0 ) symmetric case @xcite in three dimensions , where @xmath0 is the total number of internal degrees of freedom , by means of high - temperature series expansion ( htse ) .",
    "we consider a simple cubic lattice .",
    "let each site take one of the @xmath0 colors denoted by @xmath8 with @xmath9 . using the hubbard operator @xmath10 , the exchange operator is expressed as @xmath11 colors of sites @xmath12 and",
    "@xmath13 are exchanged when @xmath14 is applied . then , an su(@xmath0 ) symmetric hamiltonian reads @xmath15 where the summation is taken over all the nearest neighbor pairs .",
    "we consider the antiferromagnetic case , @xmath16 .",
    "let us show the relations with spin operators explicitly for some of the special cases below .",
    "\\(i ) when @xmath6 , this model is reduced to the ordinary heisenberg model with @xmath17 by relation @xmath18 .",
    "\\(ii ) the su(3 ) case corresponds to @xmath19 , competing quadratic and biquadratic exchange interaction,@xcite @xmath20    \\(iii ) the su(4 ) heisenberg model is related to spin 3/2 systems but more often discussed in the context of orbital- and spin - degenerate systems@xcite . in particular , the model in three dimensions has been used as an effective model of ceb@xmath21 to explain magnetic - field dependence of the transition temperature of an antiferro - orbital ordering .",
    "@xcite the four local states can be represented by @xmath22 $ ] , @xmath23 $ ] , @xmath24 $ ] , @xmath25 $ ] , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 $ ] represent an orbital state and a spin state , respectively .",
    "the pseudo - spin operators are defined by @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30=\\pm\\frac12|\\pm]$ ] , @xmath31=|\\pm]$ ] , and the exchange operator for @xmath32 is rewritten as @xmath33 the pauli matrices @xmath34 and @xmath35 may simplify this expression , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath36    note that there is a different representation of su(@xmath0 ) heisenberg model studied in detail using quantum monte carlo method ( qmc)@xcite .",
    "however , the qmc for the hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) suffers from minus sign problems in more than one dimensions @xcite",
    "if the number of competing order parameters is large and frustration exists , the transition temperature can greatly be reduced from the mean - field value even in three dimensions",
    ". that will be the case with the hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) .",
    "first , it is isotropic with respect to @xmath37 independent interacting components .",
    "furthermore , it contains frustration as most clearly seen in eq .",
    "( [ paulirep ] ) of the su(4 ) case .",
    "each of the 15 components , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , attempts an antiparallel alignment .",
    "however , it can not be attained simultaneously , _",
    "e.g. _ , simultaneous nel states of @xmath41 and @xmath42 produce a ferromagnetic alignment of the product @xmath43 .",
    "such frustration is not so explicit in the su(3 ) case in eq .",
    "( [ eq : su3rep ] ) as in the su(4 ) case , yet appearance of the minus - sign problem in the qmc indicates that similar frustration lies in it.@xcite    this frustration should become stronger as @xmath0 increases .",
    "one can see in one dimension how the system finds a compromise against this frustration .",
    "the su(@xmath0 ) heisenberg model in one dimension can be exactly solved.@xcite an important point is that the ground state has a quasi@xmath0-site periodicity .",
    "the su(4 ) case is numerically studied in more detail ; ground - state properties by the density matrix renormalization group@xcite , and thermodynamic properties by the qmc@xcite and the htse@xcite .",
    "the real - space spin - spin correlation function as a function of spin - spin distance has a positive value every four sites .",
    "its fourier transform has a outstanding cusp at @xmath44 and a small cusp at @xmath45 .",
    "regarding the temperature dependence , as temperature decreases correlation with two - site periodicity develops , and then at lower temperature another correlation occurs with @xmath0-site periodicity .",
    "@xcite    such peculiar correlation in one dimension could suggest an exotic ordering in higher dimensions .",
    "however , not much is known about the antiferromagnetic su(@xmath0 ) heisenberg model in three dimensions .",
    "in fact , its ferromagnetic variant is studied in ref .   by the htse for the uniform susceptibility that needs less effort to be calculated than susceptibility of other wave - numbers .",
    "to our knowledge , our calculation in this paper is the first htse aiming at antiferromagnetic exchange of this model . in this study , we investigate the model systematically by changing parameter @xmath0 of su(@xmath0 ) , and report some unique features of spatial correlation at finite temperature .",
    "namely , in sec .  [ sec : corfunc ] we show that the behavior of correlation functions is similar to that in one dimension , and in sec .",
    "[ sec : neeltem ] that the nel temperature disappears as @xmath0 increases from @xmath6 .",
    "what should be calculated here is @xmath46 , which is related to a correlation function .",
    "for example , when @xmath32 , fifteen components in eq .",
    "( [ paulirep ] ) contribute equally , and thus @xmath47 . for general @xmath0",
    ", we can define correlation function between sites @xmath12 and @xmath13 as @xmath48 for @xmath49 , which does not depend on @xmath50 nor @xmath51 because of the su(@xmath0 ) symmetry .",
    "its fourier transform is denoted by @xmath1 .",
    "the high - temperature expansion is performed by expanding the boltzmann factor @xmath52 in @xmath51 . in practice ,",
    "the series coefficients in the thermodynamic limit are exactly obtained by a linked - cluster expansion.@xcite to obtain the series expansion of @xmath53 up to @xmath54 $ ] , we need to calculate @xmath55 $ ] and @xmath56 $ ] for @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the hamiltonian in a linked cluster . in calculating the traces",
    ", we use a property of the permutation operator , and calculation of the traces is reduced to a combinatorial problem to count the number of circular permutations in a product of permutations .",
    "@xcite here , an important point of our analysis is that the series coefficients are obtained as polynomials of @xmath0 , for example , @xmath59 namely , the order of the series for every @xmath0 is the same .",
    "we have obtained the series for @xmath60 up to @xmath61 $ ] for arbitrary @xmath62 , and consequently @xmath1 up to @xmath63 $ ] for arbitrary @xmath64 . as a special interest , @xmath5 is obtained up to @xmath65 $ ] .",
    "the series are extrapolated using the pad approximation ( pa ) .",
    "first of all , in order to see the temperature - dependent nature of the spatial correlation , we analyze the _ next_-nearest - neighbor correlation function @xmath66 as we have done in one dimension in ref .  .",
    "figure [ fig : nncor ] shows the results .",
    "both the axes are scaled so that the high - temperature limit of every @xmath0 matches . here ,",
    "we have simultaneously plotted extrapolation from several different choices of the pa , and the difference between them approximately represents an error of the extrapolation .",
    "the lowest order of the series of @xmath60 has a nel - order - type correlation in any @xmath0 .",
    "that is , the series of @xmath67 starts with @xmath68 $ ] with sign @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , @xmath70 at high temperature .",
    "however , as antiferromagnetic correlation of each interacting component becomes larger , each short - range order disturbs another because of the frustration .",
    "the change of the sign of @xmath66 suggests that the correlation acquire a longer period at low temperature . for @xmath71 ,",
    "it is clear that @xmath66 changes the sign at a low temperature that increases with @xmath0 in this scale . for smaller @xmath0",
    ", the relevant temperature range is below the converged region , and it is difficult to conclude from this data .",
    "such a change of correlation at low temperature also appears in the fourier transform of the correlation function . a naive extrapolation of the series for @xmath1 shows bad convergence for several @xmath64 .",
    "this is probably because information at position @xmath72 is lacking when @xmath73 . in order to avoid it",
    ", we extrapolate the series of a complex function @xmath74 , and after that take the real part of the extrapolated function . here",
    ", the summation is taken for @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 is two to the power of the number of nonzeros in @xmath79 .",
    "this method also makes use of its imaginary part , and the convergence becomes better than the naive extrapolation .    as we have seen in the next - nearest - neighbor correlation function , the analysis becomes easier as @xmath0 increases .",
    "therefore , we show @xmath1 of the su(16 ) case in fig .",
    "[ fig : sq ] for a diagonal direction in the @xmath64-space , @xmath80 . here , its high temperature limit , which does not depend on @xmath64 , is subtracted . as temperature decreases",
    ", antiferromagnetic correlation develops and @xmath5 increases as the curve at @xmath81 shows .",
    "however , with further decrease of temperature , @xmath5 starts decreasing and @xmath1 with other @xmath64 increases .",
    "it is not very clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : sq ] if the maximum of @xmath1 starts moving from @xmath82 .",
    "hence , let us show another quantity . note that if the second derivative of @xmath1 at @xmath4 changes sign , the position of the maximum clearly moves .",
    "its temperature dependence for the su(16 ) model is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ddsqn16 ] .",
    "it shows a change of the sign around @xmath83 .",
    "in fact , this temperature of changing sign seems to hardly depend on @xmath0 of su(@xmath0 ) .",
    "the result above suggests that the nel order disappear at least in the su(@xmath0 ) model with large @xmath0 .",
    "namely , order with wave number @xmath84 , or disorder , should appear .",
    "then , the next question is , at which @xmath0 the nel order disappears .",
    "it is known that the su(2 ) heisenberg model has the nel order at low temperature . therefore in this section",
    ", we gradually increases @xmath0 of su(@xmath0 ) from @xmath6 . as a preparation for that",
    ", we find a reliable way to estimate a transition temperature first , using the su(2 ) model .",
    "the nel temperature @xmath85 can be characterized by divergence of @xmath5 , namely , by a singularity of @xmath5 as a function of @xmath3 . in order to analyze such a singularity",
    ", we use so - called d - log - pad approximation ( dlpa ) , _ i.e. _ , the pa for the logarithmic derivative . in using the dlpa , transformation of the expansion variable may improve the convergence of extrapolation . we choose a transformation@xcite @xmath86 where @xmath87 is an adjustable parameter that improves convergence . in fact , the singularity closest to the origin in the original series is near the imaginary axis , while @xmath85 corresponds to a singularity on the real axis . with this transformation ,",
    "singularities on the real axis approach to the origin and those near the imaginary axis go away . since the dlpa can estimate a position of the nearest singularity most accurately",
    ", errors of the dlpa can become smaller by this transformation .    in order to find an optimal @xmath87",
    ", we calculate @xmath85 as a function of @xmath87 for a couple of choices of the dlpa , and we adopt @xmath87 at which difference among different dlpas is the smallest .",
    "figure [ fig : valtran ] shows @xmath85 as a function of @xmath87 for three different choices of the dlpa . here ,",
    "@xmath88 $ ] denotes the dlpa with a polynomial of order @xmath89 over a polynomial of order @xmath0 . since [ 4/4 ]",
    "is from the series one - order lower than the others , we choose @xmath87 at which [ 5/4 ] and [ 4/5 ] are the closest , namely , @xmath90 .",
    "then , @xmath91 obtained here is 1.898 , which is close to those in the literature , @xmath92 by the qmc@xcite and @xmath93 by the htse@xcite .",
    "in addition , we have obtained a critical exponent simultaneously .",
    "we assume that the critical exponent does not depend on the spin magnitude , and compare it with that of the _ classical _ antiferromagnetic heisenberg model , in which @xmath5 is identical to the staggered susceptibility equivalent to the ` uniform susceptibility of the ferromagnetic model ' .",
    "hence we can compare the critical exponent @xmath94 .",
    "the estimation from our calculation above is @xmath95 , which is close to 1.396 by a monte carlo method@xcite , 1.406 by htse@xcite , and 1.388 by a field theory@xcite , of the classical o(3 ) model .",
    "therefore , we trust this way of analyzing @xmath85 , and use it also for the su(@xmath0 ) model with @xmath7 . also for @xmath7 , the variable transformation ( [ eq : trans ] ) should work because the singularity closest to the origin in the original series is near the imaginary axis .",
    "originally @xmath0 is an integer because it is the number of internal degrees of freedom .",
    "however , after obtaining the series as an analytic function of @xmath0 , we can regard @xmath0 as a continuous variable that has a physical meaning only when it happens to take integer values .",
    "in fact , as @xmath0 changes continuously , the properties of the series change also continuously . therefore , we gradually increases @xmath0 from @xmath6 and see @xmath0-dependence of @xmath85 .",
    "figure [ fig : ndep ] shows the results . here",
    ", we fix @xmath90 , and we plot [ 5/4 ] and [ 4/5 ] together .",
    "the optimal @xmath87 may depend on @xmath0 .",
    "however , since the difference between the two curves is very small , we regard it as an optimal @xmath87 . as @xmath0 increases",
    ", @xmath85 decreases almost linearly , and at @xmath96 the singularity corresponding to @xmath85 runs away from the real axis to a complex value with a finite imaginary part . for larger @xmath0",
    ", we do not find any singularity on the antiferromagnetic side of the real axis .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the value of @xmath0 at which nel order disappears lies in the range @xmath97 .    in addition , we have also analyzed @xmath1 with @xmath84 .",
    "however , we have not found any symptom of ordering with @xmath84 in the temperature region that we can reach by the present order of the series .",
    "in summary , we have performed high - temperature series expansions for the su(@xmath0 ) heisenberg model in three dimensions with arbitrary @xmath0 .",
    "first of all , we have calculated a _",
    "next_-nearest - neighbor correlation function .",
    "at least at large @xmath0 , it changes the sign at low temperature , which suggests that the correlation should not be like nel order , but have a longer period .",
    "analysis of the fourier transform of the correlation function also supports that the ground state of the large-@xmath0 su(@xmath0 ) heisenberg model does not have the nel - order correlation .",
    "then , we have turned to an approach from @xmath6 .",
    "since the su(2 ) heisenberg model has the nel order , it should disappear at a certain @xmath0 .",
    "we have first found a reliable way to estimate a transition temperature by analyzing the divergence of the @xmath82 component of the correlation function .",
    "next , we generalize @xmath0 to a continuous variable and increase @xmath0 gradually from @xmath6 .",
    "we have concluded that the nel ordering disappears for @xmath7 .",
