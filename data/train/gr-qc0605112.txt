    "the universe today is very close to homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "then the most important 3-manifolds in connection with cosmology are @xmath1 and @xmath2 it is well known that @xmath3 and @xmath4 are solutions of einstein s equations ( eq ) .",
    "it is irrelevant for the eq , if the spatial sections have a non trivial topology modelled on them , or not .",
    "there are many effects that arise if space is compact .",
    "the first astrophysical limits on the topology of the universe were obtained for a 3-torus @xmath5 .",
    "accordance with the homogeneity of the cosmic microwave background radiation cmbr puts a lower limit on the size of the fundamental cell , about @xmath6 mpc , which is a cube in the cases of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "later on , it was shown that this result is very sensitive to the type of the compactifications of the spatial sections . for a universe with spatial sections @xmath7 ,",
    "the fundamental cell s size is about @xmath8 of the horizon , and is compatible with the homogeneity of the cmbr @xcite . in compact universes , the pair separation histogram would present spikes for characteristic distances . at first",
    "it was thought that this technique , known as the _ crystallographic method _",
    ", was able to totally determine the topology of the universe @xcite .",
    "it turned out that the crystallographic method only applied when the group that defines the manifold , contained at least a clifford translation , i.e. a translation which moves all the points by the same distance @xcite and @xcite .",
    "generalisations of the crystallographic method were proposed , for example in @xcite .",
    "also in compact universes the light front of the cmbr interacts with itself producing circles in its sky pattern @xcite .",
    "recent results have called our attention to the possibility that methods based on multiple images will prove not to be efficient @xcite .",
    "the reasoning is that , according to observations , the curvature is very small , so the fundamental regions are so big that there has not been time enough for the formation of ghost images .",
    "the result is that for low curvature universes such as ours , only compact universes with the smallest volumes could be detected by pattern repetitions .",
    "the knowledge of the spectrum of the laplacian for compact spaces have some motivations .",
    "one of them is the decomposition of the cmbr in right set of modes , if space is non trivial .",
    "it has been studied numerically for compact hyperbolic space by @xcite . and more recently @xcite for compact spherical space .    in 1948 , casimir calculated an attraction force between parallel non charged plates in vacuum @xcite .",
    "this force is universal , in the sense that it does not depend on the physical properties of the plates , or the electric charge .",
    "its origin is of topological nature , connected to the boundary conditions .",
    "there are interesting articles , in which the imposition of boundary conditions is addressed in a more rigorous and realistic approach , for instance @xcite .",
    "the casimir effect also occurs in compact spaces . for the present era where the size of the universe is @xmath9 mpc",
    "the casimir effect is irrelevant .",
    "anyway , soon after the cosmological singularity the co - moving distances were on the order of the planck scale .",
    "it is general believed that the very primordial universe was dominated by strict quantum effects including casimir effect .",
    "although today quantum effects are commonly disregarded , they must have been fundamentally important in the primordial universe .",
    "we shall use the massless scalar field as a toy model .",
    "the casimir effect can be obtained by analytic continuation of the zeta function .",
    "this procedure is known as the zeta function regularisation , see for example @xcite , @xcite .",
    "anyway , in a more realistic context , the ability of the zeta function method has been questioned @xcite . for a calculation of the casimir energy in the spherical space , see @xcite .    in this work",
    "we expose a different technique which was previously used by us for the hyperbolic space @xcite .",
    "previous calculations for the casimir effect for the euclidean space were done , for instance by , dewitt , hart , isham and others @xcite .",
    "particularly interesting is dowker s article in which the result is also written in terms of epstein s zeta functions . a topological classification of possible `` gauge fields '' over compact base manifolds , is also given in @xcite . these and other very interesting topological questions are not going to be addressed in this present work .",
    "the crystallographic groups are discrete subgroups of the full isometry group of the euclidean space . among all crystallographic groups , only a few of them are of interest in connection to manifolds .",
    "these groups must be torsion - free , for the euclidean and hyperbolic spaces . in the celebrated list of problems proposed by hilbert ,",
    "the @xmath10 was answered affirmatively by l. bieberbach in 1910 - 1912 @xcite , @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "bieberbach showed that there are only a finite number of crystallographic groups for an euclidean space of fixed dimension .",
    "for example , when the dimension of the euclidean space is @xmath0 there are only @xmath11 compact manifolds , of which @xmath12 are orientable and @xmath13 non orientable .",
    "in this present work we shall investigate the @xmath12 compact orientable manifolds and obtain the casimir energy for each of them . due to the more simple structure connected to these topological spaces compared to the hyperbolic or spherical case , an analytical result is obtained in terms of epstein zeta functions .",
    "it is explicitly obtained that our result is independent of the type of coupling with curvature @xmath14 for these particular manifolds , which means that the calculated casimir energy density is the same even in an inflationary de sitter regime .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section [ ii ] is included for completeness . in this section",
    ", the expectation value for the energy momentum tensor , for a massless scalar field in closed minkowski spaces is obtained . section [ iii ]",
    "presents a brief description of the compact flat manifolds .",
    "the casimir energy is obtained in each subsection , [ sec1]-[sec6 ] and a numerical plot is given .",
    "natural units are used , @xmath15 , and the metric @xmath16 $ ]",
    "the point splitting method was constructed to obtain the renormalised ( finite ) expectation values for the quantum mechanical operators .",
    "it is based on the schwinger formalism @xcite , and was developed in the context of curved space by dewitt @xcite .",
    "further details are contained in the articles by christensen @xcite , @xcite . for a review ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "metric variations in the scalar action @xmath17 give the classical energy - momentum tensor @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the einstein tensor .",
    "as expected , for conformal coupling , @xmath20 with massless fields , it can be verified that the trace of the above tensor is identically zero if @xmath21 in the following we shall restrict to spatial euclidean sections and massless fields .",
    "the renormalised energy - momentum tensor involves field products at the same space - time point .",
    "thus the idea is to calculate the averaged products at separate points , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , taking the limit @xmath24 in the end .",
    "@xmath25 where for the particular manifolds addressed in this article , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the hadamard function , which is the expectation value of the anti - commutator of @xmath28 and @xmath29 on the manifold @xmath30 , see below .",
    "the causal green function or feynman propagator , for the infinite covering space @xmath31 , is obtained as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the time - ordering operator .",
    "taking its real and imaginary parts , @xmath34 we get for the hadamard function @xmath35    for a massless scalar field @xmath36    green functions , as any other function defined in the spatially compact space - time @xmath37 , must have the same periodicities of the manifold @xmath30 itself .",
    "one way of imposing this periodicity is by the direct summation of all the elements of the group @xmath38 which defines the manifold @xmath39 the above expression is named the poincar series , and when it converges , it defines functions on the manifold @xmath30 , in this particular case , the hadamard function .",
    "there are recent articles were the physical context connected to particular boundary conditions , dirichlet , neumann and periodic is addressed @xcite .",
    "edery , develops a very interesting cut - off technique and obtain analytical formulas as sums over gamma and riemann zeta functions plus an exact multidimensional remainder expressed as sums over modified bessel functions .    anyway if the spatial sections are compact , the point @xmath22 and the point @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 for all the elements of the fundamental group @xmath38 .",
    "that is , the point @xmath22 and @xmath40 are the same and identical point .",
    "this means that the only possibility is that the function ( [ f.autom ] ) must be periodic in some sense .",
    "mathematically , the functions defined on a closed manifold @xmath30 are called automorfic , see for example @xcite .    in @xcite , for instance , the summations are over the spectrum of the laplace operator .",
    "it is well known that summations over the spectrum are equivalent to summation over the closed geodesics , also known as the method of images , @xcite .",
    "this result lies at the hart of the selberg formalism for the calculations of functional traces and is valid at least for manifolds , lie groups included @xcite , see also @xcite    wald s axioms for the expectation value of the energy momentum tensor are satisfied @xcite .",
    "albeit this does not prove that the chosen state is the correct one , it does indeed indicates a criterion for a candidate physical state .",

    "the above theorem is used to rewrite the summations in the expectation values over all the elements of the group as a finite sum of epstein type zeta functions .",
