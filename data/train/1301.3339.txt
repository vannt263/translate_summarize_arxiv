    "multiplicity distributions in proton - proton collisions have been measured by the cms collaboration at @xmath1  gev , 2.36  tev and @xmath2  tev for central pseudo - rapidity intervals @xmath3 with @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the measured rapidity distributions are much broader than poisson distributions and show approximate koba - nielsen - olssen ( kno ) scaling @xcite for the smallest pseudo - rapidity interval @xmath4 with increasingly larger scaling violations as the length of the interval increases . for @xmath7 the scaling violation takes place for @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath9 is the event charged multiplicity and @xmath10 its average value in the considered @xmath11 interval .",
    "similar features have been observed at lower energies , between sps and @xmath12 collider @xcite .",
    "actually , in this energy range the scaling violations for @xmath13 start earlier ( @xmath14 ) and are numerically larger than in the lhc range .",
    "these features were well described in the framework of the dual parton model ( dpm ) @xcite and quark gluon string model ( qgsm ) @xcite .",
    "dpm and qgs are multiple - scattering models in which each individual inelastic collision is the superposition of two strings and the weights of the various multiple - scattering contributions are given by a quasi - eikonal model ( or perturbative reggeon field theory ) .",
    "one assumes a poisson distribution for each string for fixed values of the string ends .",
    "the broadening of the distribution is due both to the fluctuation in the number of strings and to the fluctuation of the string ends . for energies in the lhc range and pseudo - rapidity intervals of limited length as the ones discussed here",
    ", the effect of the fluctuations of the string ends is negligibly small and dpm reduces to an ordinary multiple scattering model with identical multiplicities in each individual scattering @xcite .",
    "the broadening of the multiplicity distributions is then entirely due to the fluctuation in the number of inelastic collisions .",
    "let us consider the charged particle per pseudo - rapidity unit @xmath15 where the numerator is the charged single particle inclusive distribution and @xmath16 the non - diffractive @xmath17 cross - section . at mid - rapidities and high energies , with identical multiplicities in each individual scattering , we have [ 1e ] dn^pp d = 1 ^pp_nd  d^pp d = 1 _ k1 _ k  _ k 1   _ k  k   dn_0^pp d =   .",
    "here @xmath18 is the average number of inelastic collisions and @xmath19 the charged multiplicity ( per pseudo - rapidity unit ) in an individual collision .",
    "note that the general formula @xcite for @xmath20 in dpm reduces to the simple expression ( [ 1e ] ) when all string contributions ( and therefore all individual scatterings ) are identical .",
    "this turns out to be the case at lhc energies for the small central rapidity intervals under consideration .",
    "@xmath21 is then equal to twice the string multiplicity per pseudo - rapidity unit .",
    "this quantity is independent of @xmath22 at mid - rapidities and high energies .",
    "let us turn now to the weights @xmath23 for the occurrence of @xmath24 inelastic collisions and their energy dependence .",
    "following @xcite we use a quasi - eikonal model with exponential residues in @xmath25 in which diffractive contributions are included as intermediate states in the eikonal model .",
    "we have @xcite [ 2e ] _ k ( ) = _ p kz ( k 1 )  .    here @xmath26 with @xmath27  gev@xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .    in ( [ 2e ] )",
    "@xmath31 is the born term given by pomeron exchange with intercept @xmath32 .",
    "the ( non - diffractive ) inelastic cross - section in eq .",
    "( [ 1e ] ) is @xmath33 . as for the numerator of eq .",
    "( [ 1e ] ) one obtains using ( [ 2e ] ) [ 3e ] _ k 1  k  _ k ( ) _ p ( )  .",
    "this is a well known identity known under the name of agk cancellation @xcite .",
    "it implies that all multiple - scattering contributions vanish identically in the single particle inclusive distribution @xmath34 . only the born term contribution @xmath31",
    "is left .",
    "the mid - rapidity values of @xmath20 measured by the alice @xcite and cms @xcite collaborations have an @xmath22-dependence @xmath35 . with @xmath16 behaving",
    "approximately as @xmath36 @xcite we find from eqs .",
    "( [ 1e ] ) to ( [ 3e ] ) , @xmath37 with @xmath38 @xcite , a value substantially larger than the one usually considered . in the following",
    "we take @xmath39 .",
    "the values of the other parameters in eq .",
    "( [ 2e ] ) are @xcite  : @xmath40  gev@xmath41 , @xmath42  gev@xmath41 , @xmath43  gev@xmath41 and @xmath44 . the parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 control the @xmath25-dependence of the elastic peak and @xmath47 contain the contribution of diffractive intermediate states .",
    "its value is obtained from the alice results for single and double diffractive cross - sections @xcite .",
    "the total @xmath17 cross - section is given by [ 4e ] _ tot ( s ) = _ p  f(z/2 ) , f(z ) = _",
    "= 1^    note that eq .",
    "( [ 4e ] ) is obtained neglecting the real part of the scattering amplitude .",
    "however , only its imaginary part contributes to the weights @xmath23 ( @xmath48 ) and to @xmath49 which are needed for the calculation of the multiplicity distribution .",
    "the charged multiplicity per unit pseudo - rapidity is given by [ 5e ] dn^pp d =  dn_0^pp d ;  = _ k1 k   _ k _ k1 _ k = _ p _",
    "nd^pp  .",
    "as shown in @xcite the model reproduces the energy dependence of @xmath20 as well as its absolute values with @xmath50 consistent with twice the string multiplicity value .",
    "the results for @xmath51 and @xmath52 at various energies are given in ref .",
    "since they are needed in the calculation of the multiplicity distribution we have listed them , together with @xmath53 , in table 1 .",
    "0.75 cm    .values of the total and non - diffractive @xmath17 cross - sections and the charged particle pseudo - rapidity densities in the central rapidity region for the energy range between 200 and 50000 gev . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we turn next to the charged particle multiplicity distributions . the particle production in one - string process",
    "is expected to correspond to independent emission of clusters , described by a poisson distribution .",
    "since the convolution of poisson distributions is also poissonian , the multiplicity distribution for a process with @xmath24 inelastic collisions will be given by a poisson distribution with average multiplicity equal to @xmath24 times the one for a single collision , ( or @xmath54 times the one of an individual string ) [ 6e ] p_n_c^(k ) = e^-k_0 ( k _ 0 ) ^n_c n_c !  .",
    "here @xmath55 is the number of emitted clusters and @xmath56 its average multiplicity in a single inelastic collision .",
    "the latter is equal to the average multiplicity of charged particles @xmath57 divided by the average cluster multiplicity @xmath58 , with [ 7e ] _ 0",
    "= _ - _ 0^+ _ 0 d   d n_0^pp d ~2_0  dn_0^pp d ( ^ * = 0 ) = 3 _ 0    valid at high energy for the relatively small values of @xmath59 under consideration",
    ".    the cluster multiplicity distribution is then given by [ 8e ] p_n_c = 1 _ nd^pp  _",
    "k1  _ k  p_n_c^(k )  .",
    "( [ 6e ] ) is strictly valid only for infinitely narrow clusters .",
    "however it can be shown to be also true to a high degree of accuracy for clusters decaying according to a poisson law @xcite .",
    "a value of the average cluster multiplicity @xmath60 has been obtained in a monte - carlo simulation where the clusters are identified with a realistic mixture of directly produced particles and known resonances @xcite .",
    "the same value @xmath61 allows to describe the charged multiplicity distributions in @xmath62 and @xmath63 scattering @xcite .",
    "the same value of @xmath58 is also needed in dpm to reproduce multiplicity distributions , long - range and short - range correlations in @xmath64 collisions up to @xmath65  gev @xcite . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "multiple scattering is responsible for long - range rapidity correlation which increase with @xmath66 .",
    "in the approach described above the @xmath17 multiplicity distributions can be computed with no extra parameters .",
    "it is convenient to plot them in the kno form ( i.e. @xmath67 versus @xmath68 ) . in this case",
    "the multiplicity distribution of final particles is identical to the one of clusters , i.e. [ 9e ] ( z ) =  p_n =   p_n_c    where @xmath69 . here",
    "@xmath9 is the number of emitted charged particles and @xmath10 its average value @xmath70 .",
    "also @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the results for @xmath73 at two energies ( @xmath1  gev and 7 tev ) and two values of @xmath59 ( @xmath4 and 2.4 ) are given in fig .  1 and compared with cms data @xcite . the corresponding predictions at 14 tev are also shown .",
    "we see that , in agreement with cms data , the model has approximate kno scaling between 900 gev and 7 tev for the small pseudo - rapidity interval @xmath74 up to a large value of @xmath75 , @xmath76 where @xmath77 has decreased by three orders of magnitude . for @xmath78 ,",
    "the kno scaling violation starts much earlier @xmath79 and the multiplicity distributions in kno form get broader with increasing energy .",
    "cm     -2 cm",
    "we have computed @xmath17 multiplicity distributions at lhc in the framework of a multiple - scattering model ( dpm ) .",
    "multiple - scattering models do not obey kno scaling . indeed , the multiple scattering contributions , which give rise to long - range rapidity correlations , become increasingly important when @xmath22 increases and since they contribute mostly to high multiplicities they lead to kno multiplicity distributions that get broader as @xmath22 increases . on the other hand , the poisson distributions in the individual scatterings",
    "lead to short - range rapidity correlations and give rise to kno multiplicity distributions that get narrower with incresing @xmath22 . due to the interplay of these two components the energy dependence of the kno multiplicity distributions ( or of its normalized moments )",
    "depends crucially on the size of the rapidity interval @xcite . for large rapidity intervals the multiple - scattering effect dominates and kno",
    "multiplicity distributions get broader with increasing @xmath22 . for small intervals",
    "the effect of the short - range component increases leading to approximate kno scaling , up to @xmath80 .",
    "we have shown that the above features are maintained up to the highest lhc energy and that for a given pseudo - rapidity interval ( @xmath78 ) the rise of the kno tail starts at a value of @xmath75 that increases with energy .",
