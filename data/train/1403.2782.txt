    "both atlas and cms collaborations at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) have discovered a @xmath3 neutral boson whose properties are compatible with the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson @xcite .",
    "the nature of this particle , including its @xmath0 properties and couplings , is currently being established @xcite .",
    "so the next important step most probably is the quest for the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) . to achieve this goal , measurement of the higgs self - interactions",
    "is necessary , which is the only way to reconstruct the higgs potential , and determine whether the new particle is the sm higgs boson or one of an enlarged higgs sector of new physics .",
    "thus , it is useful to explore the implication of the current higgs search results on models beyond the sm .",
    "one of the simplest extensions of the sm higgs sector is the two - higgs - doublet model ( 2hdm ) @xcite .",
    "it predicts the existence of two neutral @xmath0-even higgs bosons ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) , one neutral @xmath0-odd higgs ( @xmath6 ) , and two charge higgs bosons ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "in addition to their masses , two additional parameters are introduced in the theory : the ratio of the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the two higgs doublets @xmath8 , and the mixing angle between the two @xmath0-even higgs fields @xmath9 .",
    "there are many types of 2hdms , each differing in the way that the two higgs doublets couple to the fermions ( for a comprehensive review , see @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we only consider the 2hdm of type - ii ( 2hdm(ii ) ) , which is designed to avoid flavor - changing couplings of the neutral higgs bosons by one higgs doublet coupling solely to up - type and the other to down - type fermions .",
    "and this model shares many of the features of the higgs sector of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .    to understand the higgs self - interactions ,",
    "the only accessible process is double higgs production . at the lhc ,",
    "the most important sm higgs boson pair production channels have been systematically surveyed in refs.@xcite .",
    "the main processes are : ( 1 ) gluon - gluon fusion , @xmath10 , through heavy - quark loop , ( 2 ) vector boson fusion ( vbf ) @xmath11 , where vector bosons @xmath12 are radiated off quarks and fusion to higgs pair , ( 3 ) top - quark pair associated higgs boson pair production @xmath13 , and ( 4 ) double higgs strahlung @xmath14 , where higgs bosons are radiated off gauge bosons . in the sm , higgs pair production via vbf has the second largest cross section and offers a clean experimental signature of two centrally produced higgs bosons with two hard jets in the forward / backward rapidity region .",
    "hence , it is meaningful to investigate the properties of trilinear higgs self - interactions in this clean reaction . in this paper , we focus on the light @xmath0-even higgs pair production via vbf process @xmath15 within the 2hdm(ii ) to survey the properties of the trilinear higgs self - couplings @xmath16 and @xmath17 appearing in the higgs potential @xcite . in the previous research works ,",
    "the vbf higgs boson pair production process @xmath18 was surveyed in the 2hdm(ii ) at the qcd nlo @xcite .    due to the smallness of the qcd interference between the two inclusive final proton remnants , the vbf single / pair higgs production at the leading order ( lo )",
    "can be viewed as a double deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) process in a very good approximation , and the production rate can be computed by adopting the well - known structure function ( sf ) approach .",
    "apart from the interference effect , the sf approach can still be exactly employed at the qcd next - to - leading order ( nlo ) @xcite .",
    "recently , the sf approach was used to calculate the vbf single / pair higgs production at hadron colliders in the sm up to the qcd next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will implement the sf approach to calculate the vbf higgs pair production in the 2hdm(ii ) up to the qcd nnlo , and provide not only the total cross section , but also some kinematic distributions of the final higgs bosons .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : thethdm ] , we give a brief introduction to the 2hdm(ii ) .",
    "the description of the sf approach and the strategy of the qcd nnlo calculation are presented in sec.[sec : calculationmethod ] . in sec.[sec : numericalresults ] , we give the numerical results and focus on the theoretical uncertainty and some kinematic distributions .",
    "a short summary is given in sec.[sec : summary ] .",
    "finally , we present the analytic expressions for the phase space element and matrix elements of the vbf higgs pair production processes in appendix .",
    "the 2hdm contains two scalar @xmath19 doublets , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , with weak hypercharge @xmath22 . the most general higgs potential with @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath0 symmetries has the form as @xcite @xmath25,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are all real parameters , and @xmath29 transform under the @xmath24 discrete symmetry as @xmath30 after ewsb",
    ", the neutral components of @xmath31 and @xmath32 acquire vevs @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively , which are determined by the vacuum conditions of @xmath35 and satisfy @xmath36 .",
    "is fixed by the masses of weak gauge bosons @xmath37 , @xmath38 and fermi constant @xmath39 .",
    "] we parameterize the two higgs doublets as @xmath40 the higgs mass matrices are diagonalized by performing the following rotation transformations : @xmath41 where the rotation matrix @xmath42 is defined as @xmath43 @xmath9 is the mixing angle between the two @xmath0-even higgs fields @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "the fields @xmath47 and @xmath48 are nambu - goldstone bosons and their three degrees of freedom are got  eaten \" by the longitudinal components of @xmath49 and @xmath50 bosons , and induce the masses of weak gauge bosons .",
    "therefore , the 2hdm predicts five scalar particles : @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we may choose the following seven independent  physical \" parameters as the inputs of the higgs sector : @xmath51 then the quartic couplings @xmath52 can be expressed in terms of these physical parameters as @xmath53    the tree - level couplings of @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 to the sm gauge bosons and fermions with respect to the corresponding couplings of the sm higgs boson are presented in table [ tab:2hdmcoupling ] .",
    "it should be mentioned that the couplings of the @xmath0-even higgs bosons @xmath4 and @xmath5 have the same structures as those of the sm higgs boson , while the feynman rules for the @xmath54 interactions contain an additional factor @xmath55 since @xmath6 is a pseudoscalar .",
    "we can see from the table that when @xmath56 , the couplings of the light @xmath0-even higgs @xmath4 to gauge bosons and fermions approach the corresponding sm ones , and the couplings of the heavy @xmath0-even higgs @xmath5 to weak gauge bosons approach zero .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0-even higgs @xmath5 decouples from the vbf process @xmath57 in the sm limit of @xmath58 . in this work",
    "we use @xmath59 as an input parameter of the higgs sector instead of @xmath60 to manifest the effects on the higgs couplings to gauge bosons involved in the vbf @xmath4 pair production , considering the fact that the higgs couplings to weak gauge bosons are proportional to @xmath59 and @xmath61 .    .",
    "tree - level couplings of the neutral higgs bosons of the 2hdm(ii ) to gauge bosons and fermions .",
    "each coupling is normalized to the corresponding coupling of the sm higgs boson . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      analogous to the vbf @xmath62 production , the signal of vbf @xmath63 production involves two energetic forward and backward jets in association with two centrally produced higgs bosons .",
    "this character plays an important role in discriminating the vbf signal from the heavy qcd background .",
    "since a precision study of the kinematic distributions of the final higgs bosons for the signal process is helpful in theoretical and experimental analyses , we provide the nnlo qcd corrected transverse momentum @xmath64 , rapidity @xmath65 and invariant mass @xmath66 distributions of the final higgs bosons for the vbf @xmath63 production at @xmath67 colliders . in order to assess the impact of the nnlo qcd corrections , we introduce the differential nnlo qcd @xmath68-factor , which is defined as @xmath69 where @xmath70 stands for a kinematic variable .",
