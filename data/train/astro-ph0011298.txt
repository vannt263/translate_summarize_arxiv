    "above 100 mev , egret has discovered @xmath070 persistent , unidentified , sources at medium latitudes that clearly differ from the @xmath040 sources seen close to the galactic plane ( @xcite ) : they are significantly softer , fainter , and have a steeper logn - logs function than at low latitudes ( @xcite ) .",
    "they have been tentatively associated with the local interstellar medium and the gould belt ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , but their nature remains a mystery .",
    "the likely candidates present in the galactic disc , such as pulsars , supernova ( sn ) remnants , and ob associations , can not account for so many sources off the plane .",
    "interestingly , the starburst gould belt disc is tilted at @xmath6 to the milky way and close enough for weak sources to be detected .",
    "proposing an origin of the sources in the belt however requires one a ) to confront their spatial distribution with that of the belt and other likely galactic structures given strong observational biases ; b ) to evaluate the number of likely @xmath3-ray emitters , i.e. compact stars , formed in the belt in the recent past .",
    "both aspects are analyzed below before discussing the possible nature of the sources .",
    "our galaxy produces on average 2.5@xmath7 sne per century ( @xcite ) , @xmath885% of which arise from the core collapse of a massive star .",
    "this value and the stellar distribution in the galaxy imply a local rate of 20 events myr@xmath9 kpc@xmath2 , in reasonable agreement with the 29 progenitors myr@xmath9 kpc@xmath2 found with masses @xmath10 8 m@xmath11 within 1 kpc from the sun ( @xcite ) .",
    "this region , however , includes the starburst gould belt with its 300 pc radius .",
    "today , the belt hosts 432 @xmath12 15 progenitors with masses @xmath10 8 m@xmath11 ( @xcite ) and their maximum lifetime will imply a crude minimum rate @xmath10 40 collapses myr@xmath9 kpc@xmath2 in a few tens of myr .",
    "numerous explosions have lately occurred from the first generations of massive stars formed in the belt .",
    "a recent - past rate can be inferred from the current stellar content of the belt as a function of mass , for both short - lived and long - lived stars , given a few assumptions : 1 ) a stellar initial mass spectrum @xmath13 with a range of indices @xmath14 as measured in nearby ob associations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ; 2 ) lifetime estimates as modelled for stars with solar metallicity ( @xmath15 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and interpolated in mass ; 3 ) a constant birth rate for simplicity ; 4 ) a conservative mass threshold for collapse of 8 m@xmath11 . using this formalism ,",
    "star counts were integrated in various spectral bands and scaled to the observed belt star counts ( @xcite ) to eliminate the unknown birth rate and amplitude _",
    "the significant increase in birth rate obtained for stars @xmath1640 myr confirms the belt nuclear age and the validity of our simple formalism .",
    "sn yields of 21.4 @xmath12 0.8 , 24.1 @xmath12 0.9 , and 27.2 @xmath12 1.0 per myr were obtained for @xmath17 indices of @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , respectively , for a 40 myr old belt .",
    "the quoted error results from the uncertainty in the observed star counts .",
    "these estimates decrease by 15% with belt age from 50 to 30 myr",
    ". truncating the mass spectrum at 60 or 120 m@xmath11 , or choosing 10 m@xmath11 for the collapse threshold , has @xmath21 impact on the results .",
    "given the uncertainties for the belt age and @xmath17 index ( particularly at large masses ) , we infer a frequency of 20 to 27 sne per myr and a rate of 75 to 95 myr@xmath9 kpc@xmath2 which is 3 to 5 times the local galactic one .",
    "this high rate is valid for the past few myr .",
    "it is consistent with the power of @xmath22 erg myr@xmath9 kpc@xmath2 required to maintain the local cosmic - ray density ( @xcite ) for a standard sn - to - cosmic - ray energy conversion efficiency of a few percent ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is consistent with the presence , within the belt , of four 0.1 - 1 myr radio loops ( @xcite ) and the local bubble .",
    "thirteen radio pulsars from the princeton catalogue are found at high latitudes with distances @xmath161 kpc and age @xmath162 myr , but they are too few to show a correlation with the inclined belt or with the galactic plane .",
    "the narrow radio beams from many more may miss the earth .",
    "the distribution on the sky of a subset of the unidentified egret sources is strongly reminiscent of the tilted gould belt .",
    "the subset includes all _ persistent _ sources at @xmath23 from the 3rd egret catalogue , i.e. those detected with a significance @xmath24 ( @xmath25 at @xmath26 ) using the cumulative data from april 1991 to october 1995 .",
    "sources listed as likely artifacts were discarded .",
    "the 67 sources thus selected are displayed in fig . 1 .",
    "80% of them show no time variability , the others are only moderately variable ( @xcite ) .",
    "strong biases due to the instrument exposure and the bright interstellar background does influence their apparent spatial distribution . to assess their correlation with various structures , a maximum - likelihood test was applied that takes these biases into account ( @xcite ) .",
    "an important degree of freedom is the unknown luminosity function @xmath27 l@xmath28 of the parent sources .",
    "the flatter the function , the sharper the longitude and latitude profiles of any galactic population because more sources remain visible to large distances .",
    "this effect being quite strong , @xmath29 was kept as a free parameter over a wide range of values : @xmath30 .",
    "egret exposure maps above 100 mev for the 4.5-year survey ( @xcite ) , the observed isotropic background of ( @xmath31 cm@xmath2 s@xmath9 sr@xmath9 , and the interstellar background model ( @xcite ) of the egret survey were used to model the source visibility in @xmath33 by @xmath33 bins across the sky .    to allow for possible extragalactic sources among the unidentified ones , linear combinations of an isotropic and a galactic component were tested ( and nicknamed as in table 1 ) .",
    "the choice of galactic distributions cover the various sites likely to display sources at mid latitudes : 1 ) sources uniformly distributed in a spherical galactic halo , 20 kpc in radius ; 2 ) sources uniformly distributed in longitude in the `` local galactic disc '' with _ any _ exponential or gaussian scale height ; 3 ) sources spread in a `` thick galaxy '' with a gaussian radial scale length of 9.3 kpc and an exponential scale height of 0.4 kpc , typical of radio pulsars ( @xcite ) ; 4 ) sources distributed in the interstellar medium as mapped by the nh@xmath34n(hi+2h@xmath35 ) column - densities ( @xcite ) ; 5 ) sources in the gould belt as traced by the column - densities of stars with spectral type @xmath16 b3 , fitted from the yale bright star catalogue data according to the function @xmath36 exp(-0.5*sin@xmath37$]/sin@xmath38 ) , with the resulting width @xmath39 and median latitude @xmath40 of the star distribution displayed in fig .",
    "1 . distributions 4 ) and 5 ) provide independent ways to trace the belt through its young stars as well as its clouds since the latter dominate the interstellar maps at medium latitudes .",
    "the reliability of the analysis was checked by applying it to the 67 active galactic nuclei discovered by egret and spread over the sky . for them , an isotropic distribution indeed yields the best fit and no galactic component , however large in scale height , is detected : the maximum log - likelihood value remains constant within 0.1 for all the models tested in table 1 .",

    "not only are the sources local , the significant likelihood increase between the loc and belt fits , with a chance probability @xmath60= \\ , 3\\times 10^{-6}$ ] , gives strong support to their origin in the inclined belt system . on the other hand ,",
    "the sources at @xmath5 were shown to be distinctly fainter and softer than those at lower latitudes and a subset of @xmath020 were pointed out along the belt ( @xcite ) .",
    "together these findings provide compelling evidence that a distinct population of 20 to 40 egret sources belong to the gould belt . based on their spatial distribution",
    "only , they could be as numerous as 40 @xmath4 5 at @xmath5 .",
    "the luminosity index of their parent population is @xmath61 .",
    "with luminosities @xmath62 of 1 to @xmath63 w over 4@xmath64 sr at 500 pc ( for e@xmath2 spectra ) , the sources can not be unresolved gas clumps irradiated by the local cosmic - ray flux : the required mass of @xmath65 m@xmath11 at 500 pc can not have escaped the radio and ir surveys , even when considering radio beam dilution from unresolved clouds ( @xcite ) . nor can they be slow ( @xmath1620 km / s ) , old neutron stars , accreting gas from a dense cloud : they are at least 10@xmath66 times too rare ( @xcite ) and the maximum bondi - hoyle accretion power of @xmath67 w that results from the formation of a surrounding hii region by the neutron star uv radiation , is 10 times too low ( @xcite ) .",
    "the accretion power reached for fast ( @xmath10200 - 400 km / s ) , highly magnetized ( 10@xmath68 g ) neutron stars with long periods in the intercloud medium ( 10@xmath69 h cm@xmath69 ) , though increased by kelvin - helmholtz instabilities in the shocked gas , is also orders of magnitude too low ( @xcite ) .",
    "isolated accreting black holes with masses of 10 m@xmath11 ( @xcite ) and 35 m@xmath11 ( @xcite ) have been proposed , but they would be too rare in the belt : for mass progenitors @xmath10 25 m@xmath71 ( @xcite ) , black holes are 3 to 9 times fewer than neutron stars for @xmath17 indices of @xmath20 & @xmath18 , respectively",
    ". moreover , the luminosity @xmath62/@xmath72 ratios @xmath73 observed assuming statistically 1 or 2 faint rosat source in an egret error box , are clearly at variance with p - p interactions in the accretion flow ( @xcite ) , unless non - thermal acceleration is advocated ( in micro - quasar jets ? ) .",
    "these luminosity ratios are also at variance with standard accreting binary systems .",
    "i found no spatial coincidence with a wr star or the numerous o stars at mid latitude despite their highly supersonic winds with kinetic powers of 10@xmath74 w. eight pulsars are known in @xmath3 rays , 7 bright young ones at kpc distances in the galactic disc , and a faint , older one inside the gould belt ( geminga ) .",
    "so , the present sample is strongly biased to high luminosity and youth .",
    "the stability of most of the belt sources ( @xcite , @xcite ) is consistent with a pulsar origin .",
    "born with large velocities ( @xcite ) , galactic pulsars rapidly migrate away from the plane to mid - latitudes .",
    "the outer gap model ( @xcite ) for beamed emission predicts that 4 - 5 galactic pulsars should be detectable at @xmath5 in contrast with the 40 @xmath4 5 sources associated with the belt .",
    "similarly , the wide - beam comptonized polar - cap model ( @xcite ) predicts 1 - 2 galactic pulsars detectable at @xmath75 as opposed to 25 @xmath4 5 sources linked to the belt .",
    "these discrepancies can not be resolved by increasing the galactic pulsar birth rate by more than 30% for fear of overproducing sources at low latitude ( @xcite ) , nor by using larger scale heights or velocities which are not supported by the radio data .    given the enhanced sn rate in the belt and its inclined geometry , i propose that the sources associated with the belt be relics of belt supernovae in the form of few myr old pulsars .",
    "detecting 20 to 40 belt collapsed stars as egret sources requires the product of the beaming fraction @xmath76 and pulsar age be of order 1 - 1.5 , for instance @xmath77 over 2 or 3 myr .",
    "@xmath78 is predicted for the main polar - cap beam ( @xcite ) , and values of 0.1 - 0.6 are possible for the outer - gap fan beam depending on pulsar age ( @xcite ) .",
    "yet , one should bear in mind the extreme closeness of the belt objects .",
    "the @xmath3-ray luminosity , @xmath62 , scales with the spin - down power , @xmath79 , as @xmath80 over 4 decades in @xmath79 ( @xcite ) . extrapolating from the faint geminga for only half a decade , to @xmath81 w @xmath82 w over 1 sr , suggests that a pulsar 10 times as old as geminga , i.e. 3-myr old , remains easily detectable by egret out to 500 pc .",
    "furthermore , the recorded @xmath3-ray lightcurves show that 10 times fainter emission is detected off the main peaks over large phase intervals .",
    "this side emission from a 3 myr old pulsar would remain detectable by egret up to 350 pc , thus largely increasing the detection probability @xmath76 .",
    "recent polar cap simulations indicate that 4 - 5 times as many off - beam sources as on - beam ones would be detectable above 100 mev at a given distance ( @xcite ) , therefore up to 350 pc for side emission . in this case , the population of belt neutron stars born in the last 2 - 3 myr may account for the belt @xmath3-ray sources .",
    "it may also explain the scarcity of bright on - beam - like sources off the galactic plane .",
    "the softness of side emission ( @xmath83 = 1.8 to 2.5 ) may also explain the soft average spectral index @xmath84 = 2.25 @xmath4 0.03 measured for the belt sources as opposed to that of @xmath84 = 1.74 @xmath4 0.02 obtained the 5 on - beam pulsars in the galactic plane .",
    "preliminary simulations show that the belt spatial signature is preserved over at least 2 myr despite rapid migration .",
    "so , given our present understanding of pulsar @xmath3-ray emission , the hypothesis that the gould belt sources be powered by pulsars , mostly off - beam pulsars , is quite plausible .",
    "if true , the belt pulsars would considerably broaden our understanding of photon - particle cascades inside their magnetospheres to older and lower - luminosity objects at various aspect angles .",
    "the radio beam being apparently much narrower than the @xmath3-ray beam , at least in one dimension , one would expect a majority of radio - silent pulsars among the belt sources .",
    "the spectral criterion @xmath85 2 often adopted to search for @xmath3-ray pulsars may not be valid for nearby objects",
    ". the next generation telescope , glast , to be launched in 2005 , will be able to detect their periodicity in the @xmath3-ray signal , if any .",
    "as supernova relics , the belt sources would bring useful constraints on the initial star mass spectrum at large masses and on the abundance of explosive nucleosynthesis products in supernova remnants ."
