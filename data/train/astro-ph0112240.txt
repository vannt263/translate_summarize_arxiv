    "quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) are short - period , quasi - periodic oscillations widely observed in accreting binary systems , such as cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) and x - ray binaries ( xbs ; see @xcite ; more recent reviews particularly stressing on  kilohertz qpos \" include ( , ) .",
    "there are two major types of  quasi - periodic \" oscillations in cvs : dwarf nova oscillations ( dnos ) and ( in a narrower sense ) qpos ( for a review , see ) .",
    "dnos are oscillations observed only in dwarf nova outbursts , having periods 1929  s , and have long ( several tens to @xmath0100 wave numbers ) coherence times ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the amplitudes of dnos in optical wavelengths are generally small ( usually @xmath10.01 mag ) .",
    "several models have been proposed to account for dnos ( and qpos in general ) , including vertical or radial oscillations of the accretion disk @xcite , reprocessing of the light by the orbiting blobs @xcite , non - radial pulsations of the accretion disk ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , radial oscillation of the accretion disk ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , excitation of trapped oscillations around the discontinuity of physical parameters @xcite , and oscillation of the boundary layer of the accretion disk ( , a , b ) .",
    "qpos ( other than dnos ) are more widely seen in cvs , having periods 40  s to several hundred seconds , have much shorter ( usually less than @xmath010 wave numbers ) coherence lengths .",
    "these less coherent qpos have phenomenological similarities with qpos in xbs , both in their coherence lengths and in the characteristic periods scaled by the keplerian timescales at the inner edge of the accretion disk .    a potentially new class of qpos ( super - qpos ) were discovered during the 1992 superoutburst of sw uma @xcite .",
    "these qpos were only observed during the particular stages ( usually the initial stage ) of superoutbursts ( for a review of su uma - type dwarf novae and superoutbursts , see ) , and have periods of several hundred seconds , comparable to those of qpos other than dnos .",
    "the most striking features of super - qpos were the large amplitudes ( up to 0.2 mag ) and the long coherence , lasting at least several tens of wave numbers @xcite .",
    "the super - qpos observed by @xcite consisted of sinusoidal components and short , deep dips . @xcite also suggested that the qpos reported by @xcite showed only the sinusoidal components , but sharing all the other characteristics with super - qpos observed during the 1992 superoutburst .",
    "@xcite proposed that an orbiting blob , which incidentally eclipsed the central part of the accretion disk , was responsible for the large - amplitude super - qpos .",
    "@xcite suggested that the reason why super - qpos are only observed during the particular stage of superoutburst may be that such a blob can be formed under the enhanced dissipation ( i.e. turbulent condition ) caused by the tidal instability , which is responsible for superhumps ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "studies of super - qpos have been , however , hindered by the paucity of examples .",
    "ef peg is the only other example , which showed the remarkable time evolution of super - qpos during the 1991 superoutburst .",
    "ef peg was originally discovered as a variable star @xcite , who suggested the mira - type classification .",
    "@xcite recorded two additional ( bright and faint ones ) maxima , and derived a period period of 157 d in combination with the maxima recorded by @xcite . however , @xcite only recorded an apparently nonvariable star of 13.514.0 photographic magnitude on 157 plates .",
    "@xcite finally revealed that the true ef peg is a normally fainter companion to a nonvariable star ( labeled as @xmath2 in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that ef peg is a dwarf nova with a large outburst amplitude .",
    "their observations showed the existence of two types of  short and long  outbursts , which strongly suggested an su uma - type dwarf nova ( for a recent review of su uma - type stars and their observational properties , see @xcite ) . upon this information , the variable star observers league in japan ( vsolj ) called for a monitoring campaign for an outburst since 1985 .",
    "@xcite searched sonneberg plates , and found nine outbursts between 1928 and 1986 , confirming the classification by @xcite .",
    "no firm outbursts above a magnitude of 12 had been recorded until the discovery of an outburst by patrick schmeer on 1991 october 15.779 ut at visual magnitude 10.9 @xcite . since then , only two secure outbursts have been observed in 1995 january and 1997 october , according to the reports to the vsnet collaborationhttp://www.kusastro.kyoto - u.ac.jp / vsnet/@xmath3 , and no further outburst has been observed up to 2001 july .",
    "these observations indicate the intrinsically low outburst frequency of this object . @xcite",
    "even suggested that ef peg is past the period minimum of the cv evolution .",
    "the first detection of superhumps was made by @xcite on 1991 october 18 .",

    "these qpos had disappeared when the amplitude of superhumps reached the maximum ( october 20 ) . as seen in [ fig : qpooc ] , the maximum jump in the qpo phase was less than 0.002 d , indicating that the oscillations were essentially coherent during the entire observing run covering 20 qpo cycles , although a strong global variation of the period was present .",
    "such a long coherence of oscillations is a signature of super - qpos @xcite .",

    "the same explanation in @xcite could apply to the present large - amplitude qpos , except that the present qpos incidentally lack the dip component .",
    "the rapid decrease of the qpo period ( figure [ fig : qpovar ] , [ fig : qpooc ] ) is the unique characteristic of the present qpos .",
    "such a large variation of the qpo frequency within a short time ( less than 3.2 hr ) has never been observed in other qpos of cvs . furthermore , the period decrease occurred continuously ( section [ sec : superqpo ] ) , rather than a sudden mode switch between different periods .",
    "the phenomenon is hard to explain , if these qpos arise from oscillations of the accretion disk , or from the beat between the rotation of the magnetic white dwarf and the slowly rotating part of the accretion disk .",
    "such a rapid decrease of the qpo period can be more naturally understood if the rotating blob ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , which rapidly lost its angular momentum via the viscosity in a turbulent disk .",
    "if we assume a 1 m@xmath27 primary and nearly keplerian orbits , a decrease of the period from 18 m to 6.8 m corresponds to a decrease of the radius of the orbit from 1.6 10@xmath28 to 8.3 10@xmath29 cm .",
    "this decrease in 3.2 hr corresponds to a radial velocity of 6.7 10@xmath30 cm s@xmath10 ( 1/140  1/200 of the orbiting velocity ) , which seems to be a reasonable value for accretion during outburst .",
    "although such a rapid decrease of the qpo period is unique among cvs , there are a few known similar examples in oscillations ( or large - amplitude qpos ) in some xbs .",
    "the best - known example is seen in the rapid burster ( mxb 1730 - 335 ) .",
    "the first indication of such oscillations during its type ii bursts from the rapid burster was found with the ginga satellite @xcite .",

    "the second example of similar oscillations was found in the bursting x - ray pulsar gro j1744 - 28 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the characteristics of the oscillations in gro j1744 - 28 was studied in detail by @xcite .",
    "although the nature of such oscillations are still poorly understood , several attempts have been made to understand these two unique objects . in the case of gro j1744 - 28",
    ", @xcite considered an interplay between radial and vertical energy transport in the accretion disk , causing oscillations in the fraction of the gas pressure to the total pressure .",
    "@xcite showed that these oscillations eventually lead to a lightman - eardley instability @xcite , which @xcite considered to be the cause of type ii bursts .",
    "@xcite further showed that the characteristic qpo frequency can be reproduced by a selection of parameters .",
    "@xcite suggested that low - frequency qpos in some xbs ( including those of the rapid burster ) and black - hole candidates can be produced via dissipation of energy in the coronal region above the accretion disk .",
    "while these models were able to reproduce some parts of characteristics of qpos ( and bursts ) observed in these systems , they have not yet succeeded in explaining a rapid decrease of qpo periods ; the cause of this phenomenon is thus still an open question .",
    "these models for the rapid burster and gro j1744 - 28 assume the strong radiation pressure near the inner edge of the accretion disk .",
    "since such a condition is hard to achieve in a cv disk , the mechanisms proposed for qpos in xbs would not be directly applicable to the present qpos in ef peg .",
