    "so far , only a few chaotic circuits had their parameter spaces experimentally obtained , a space that contains information about the lyapunov exponents and the periodicity of the observed time series for a range of parameters @xcite .",
    "the relevance of studying parameter spaces of nonlinear systems is that it allows us to understand how periodic behaviour , chaos and bifurcations come about in a nonlinear system .",
    "in fact , parameters leading to the different behaviours are strongly correlated .",
    "chaotic and periodic regions appear side by side in all scales in universal shapes and forms .",
    "not long ago , gallas @xcite numerically observed periodic structures embedded in parameter chaotic regions , in the parameter space of the hnon map .",
    "he coined a name for them : shrimps ; given the remarkable similarity between parameter regions leading to periodic behaviour , which appear all along special directions , and how shrimps in barbecue stick are so well organised .",
    "for some classes of nonlinear systems such as the one studied here the periodic structures appear aligned along spiral curves describing parameters for saddle - node bifurcations and super - stable behaviour , and that cross transversally parameter curves containing homoclinic bifurcations @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the difficulty in obtaining parameter spaces resides in a reliable method to vary precisely a parameter , usually a resistance , in a controlled , autonomously , and reproducible fashion .",
    "parameters are not constant and suffer time varying alterations .",
    "this factor becomes even more severe when the experiment is done over long time spans .",
    "finally , the numerical resolution of the parameters and their nominal values can not be achieved or reproduced experimentally .",
    "even very simple nonlinear electronic systems can not have their behaviours reproduced numerically ; the main reason is that the electronic components have non - ideal characteristic curves . in particular , and with regard to this work , an idealised piece - wise linear component behaves non - linearly in an experiment .",
    "these factors are behind our motivation to propose an approach to obtain experimental parameter spaces that are not only reliable , autonomous , and reproducible , but that can also reproduce nominal parameter values considered in numerical experiments .",
    "high resolution parameter space allows one to reproduce experimentally the self - similar topological character observed in numerically obtained parameter spaces .    in order to tackle these experimental issues , previous works",
    "have proposed different strategies to construct experimental parameter spaces .",

    "al . considered a manual or step motor control of precision multi - turn potentiometer @xcite .",
    "@xcite used a proto - board to do the experiment and varied by hand 490 x 162 values of a negative resistor and an inductor to produce parameter spaces . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was used a keithley power source controlled by labviewas one parameter and a precision potentiometer manually controlled as the second parameter .",
    "the use of a digital potentiometer would provide a reliable , autonomously , and reproducible way to obtain parameter spaces .",
    "however , the available digital potentiometers on the market are limited to resistances above 1 k@xmath2 and usually not more than 256 steps are possible .",
    "in addition , their control is not easy to carry out with typical data acquisition systems or labview.    the technological novelty in this work is to present the design of a digital potentiometer with precisely calibrated small resistance steps ( as low as 0.100 @xmath2 ) that allows 1024 steps ( or even more ) to change the resistance . with these potentiometers and a set of resistors , switches and relays",
    ", we were able to autonomously obtain a high resolution parameter space of the chua s circuit ( with resolutions of 400 x 562 and 1023 x 126 points , varying one resistor with step sizes of 0.2@xmath2 and another with 0.1@xmath2 ) , which could remarkably reproduce the numerically obtained parameter spaces .",
    "this proposed electronic component allowed us to carry out a detailed experimental investigation of the parameter space of a modified chua s circuit , namely we have characterised this circuit by varying the resistance ( r ) and the inductor resistance ( @xmath1 ) @xcite . among other accomplishments",
    ", we have demonstrated that even higher period periodic windows and the complex topological structure of the scenario for the appearance of periodic behaviours can be observed experimentally .",
    "simulations , considering a normalized equation set that models the chua s circuit , and also the normalised version of the experimental i(v ) curve , were carried out in order to demonstrate that the occurrence of periodic structures observed in the high - resolution experimental parameter space could also be numerically observed . in particular",
    ", we showed numerically and experimentally that this parameter space presents self - similar periodic structures , the shrimps , embedded in a domain of chaos @xcite .",
    "we also show experimentally that those self - similar periodic regions organize themselves in period - adding bifurcation cascades , and whose sizes decrease exponentially as their period grows @xcite",
    ". we also report on malformed shrimps on the experimental parameter space , result of tiny nonlinear deviations from a symmetric piecewise linear i(v ) curve .",
    "we have considered the chua s circuit @xcite to perform our study experimentally and numerically because this circuit has been studied in many applications such as in chaos control @xcite , synchronisation @xcite and others , but the use of a higher precision potentiometers here proposed can be used to characterise , study , and precisely control the behaviour of any electronic equipment .",
    "detailed information about the design of this new electronic component is being provided in this manuscript .",
    "prior to the development of the chaotic circuit , we designed the digital potentiometer with the aim of obtaining high - resolution parameter spaces considering precise and tiny variations in the resistances , which allows reproducible experiments happening for the same parameters .",
    "the digital potentiometer is presented in fig .",
    "only three resistor circuits of the in series association were presented in the figure in order to better illustrate its structure . the 10 pin left connector stands for the digital data coming from input / output ( i / o ) digital ports of the daq board .",
    "the pins and all other components have their index identified with a number x in the end ( e.g. pinx ) .",
    "pinx is associated to the bit number numerated from the least significant digit .",
    "each pin is connected to a transistor tx in a switching configuration with rx as a resistor to limit base current , the collector connected to the anode of a diode dx and one pole of the coil of the relay .",
    "the cathode of dx is connected to the + 12v battery pin and the other pole of the coil .",
    "all the tx emitters are connected to the ground pin of the battery .",
    "all relays are connected in parallel with a 3 resistor circuit . in the non - switched position ,",
    "relays short - circuit the resistor circuit x , leading to a negligible in series resistance for the branch x of the circuit .",
    "when switched , they open the short circuit and rax , rbx and rcx equivalent resistance add to the in series resistor network .",
    "rax and rcx are calibration resistances while rbx is a precision resistor . if rbx is less than the necessary rax is a multi - turn trimpot to add a small resistance .",
    "if the rbx is more than the desired the parallel resistor rcx is used to lessen the equivalent value and rax is substituted by a short circuit .",
    "the digital potentiometer idea was captured from the structure of a switched resistor digital to analog converter which contains a parallel resistor network .",
    "as in the case of the circuit , one 60 ah 12.0 v car battery was used to drive the digital potentiometers .",
    "the calibration was done using a keithley digital multimeter model 2001 in the four wire mode , i.e. in order to subtract leads resistance .",
    "the relays of the series association were switched by transistor driver circuits connected to i / o digital ports of the data acquisition board used for control and data acquisition .",
    "thus it was possible to write a ten digit binary number in order to select one of the 1024 possible combinations .",
    "then the potentiometer resistances r and @xmath1 follows the equation : @xmath3        @xmath4    .,width=326 ]     characteristic of the circuit presented in fig .",
    "the linear fittings are presented in the figure .",

    "chua s circuit scheme is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , constructed in a single face circuit board with the same scheme of @xcite i.e. , @xmath9 nf , @xmath10 nf , and @xmath11 mh . these values were obtained from the combination of passive commercial available components and measured with a keithley digital multimeter model 2001 or an impedance analyser for the reactive components . the measurement of components allowed the choice of the closest possible values to components , better than the factory precision .",
    "we evaluate the oscillation main frequency as a rough approximation by @xmath12 which gives 1596 hz .",
    "further increase on frequency , i.e. by reducing passive component values , seems to destroy periodic structures that are observed in this circuit .",
    "thus this oscillation frequency was the best choice that allowed us to store large time series for data analysis .",
    "other parameters were experimentally determined .",
    "the five - fold piecewise linear element consists of two operational amplifiers ( opamp ) and resistances @xmath13to @xmath14 , the @xmath15 characteristics was defined and normalised by the scheme @xmath5 and @xmath16 with @xmath17 ms and @xmath18 v. here s stands for the inverse resistance unity .",
    "this curve is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , with 5-fold linear fittings used for simulations given by :    with the significant digits limited by the fitting accuracy .",
    "the circuit variables @xmath19 , @xmath20 measuring points are indicated by their respective probes .",
    "they correspond to the voltages across the capacitors @xmath21 and @xmath22 and the third variable , the current @xmath23 , is obtained from the relation @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the voltage indicated by the p probe .",
    "the electronic inductor is defined by two opamps connected to the resistors @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath1 together with the capacitor @xmath30 .",
    "this is a gyrator circuit with inductance as @xmath31 .",
    "the resistor r , used as one control parameter , was composed by a 1193.445 @xmath2 resistor in series with the digital potentiometer that varied in the range of 1193.445 @xmath2 to 1993.445 @xmath2 with a 0.200 @xmath2 and , in a second experiment , the potentiometer was varied in the range of 1414.642 @xmath2 to 1619.242 @xmath2 a 0.200 @xmath2 .",
    "the other control parameter , the resistor @xmath1 was a digital potentiometer whose range varied within the interval [ 8.077 64.277 ] @xmath2 in the first experiment and [ 28.077 40.677 ] @xmath2 in the second experiment , both cases with a 0.100 @xmath2 stepsize .",
    "the chua s circuit , built with tl084 operational amplifiers ( opamp ) was fed by two 12.0 v , 7 ah no - break batteries and the voltage across @xmath21 , passed by a simple opamp buffer , was measured by a national instruments data acquisition ( daq ) interface , model pci-6259 with 16 bit resolution , maximum sampling rate of 1.25 msamples / s , for data storage .",
    "also , labview was used to data acquisition and analysis @xcite . a keithley 2400 voltage / current source in series with the chua s diode",
    "was applied to obtain the i(v ) data . for each time series ,",
    "the potentiometers r and @xmath1 were switched by a labview routine with values previously determined and calibrated to give precise equivalent steps .",
    "after calibration , the 1024 values of each potentiometer were tested with a linear fitting , giving slopes equal to steps up to four significant digits .",
    "the 5-fold piecewise linear @xmath32 characteristics were presented in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and eq .",
    "we have carried out experiments with the chua s circuit recollecting time series for the calculation of the lyapunov exponents .",
    "time series were generated with a 50 ksamples / s and a 7 s length . as transient , after setting the pair of parameters r and @xmath1 , a 50 s waiting time was considered .",
    "it is worth commenting that data acquisition to obtain 562 x 400 meshes of time series lasted 3 weeks .",
    "the fact that the experimental circuit could reproduce many relevant structures obtained numerically implies that the general bifurcation scenario of these periodic windows of the parameter space are robust to external perturbations and should be expected to be observed in nature . during this time",
    "the batteries were recharged many times , and the room temperature has varied during a 24h period and during these 3 weeks .",
    "the circuit is not switched off between subsequent measurements only at the highest r when recharge was necessary .",
    "each restart of the system has changed the attractor initial conditions . however , because the parameters were varied from high r to lower r values and from low @xmath1 to higher @xmath1 values , the trajectory at restart was always going towards the same fixed points or simple periodic orbits . by starting at parameters leading to such attractors",
    "provide results as if the system was never switched off .",
    "thus , this form of covering the parameter space allows best reproducibility since the next attractor is equivalent of numerical continuation , i.e. the last state of the system at a pair of control parameters is the beginning of the next one .    .",
    "resolution of parameters r and @xmath33 is 2@xmath2 , and we have considered a mesh with 400 values for r and 562 values for @xmath33 . ( b ) corresponding simulated parameter space obtained from using the model of ref . @xcite but with a 5-fold piece - wise @xmath32 eq .",

    "this result led us to conclude that our experimentally and numerically obtained periodic windows have a complex structure as expected in refs .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] that periodic windows organize themselves in an odd period adding bifurcation cascade starting from the top left corner of the parameter space towards the spiral center , and whose attractors present period varying from 3 to 17 .",
    "window sizes reduce as the period increases and their width @xmath45 in @xmath2 reaches its minimal value of 2 @xmath2 for periods 15 and 17 .",
    "fitting results indicate that the decay exponent is @xmath49 ( experimental results ) and @xmath50 ( numerical results ) is in the same order of magnitude of the largest positive lyapunov exponent of the chaotic attractor in the chaotic regions surrounding the shrimps ( about 0.2 ) , as expected @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have successfully built an autonomous , reliable , and reproducible digital potentiometer that allowed precise scientific measurements of physical invariants of a chaotic circuit . as an application of the power of our proposed potentiometer",
