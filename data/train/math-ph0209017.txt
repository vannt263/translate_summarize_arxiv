    "in recent papers some intruiging connections have been found between the groundstate wavefunctions of the xxz quantum spin chain at @xmath1 , the dense o(@xmath2 ) or temperley - lieb loop model on the square lattice and alternating sign matrices ( asms ) @xcite . in particular ,",
    "different boundary conditions in the spin chain and the loop model correspond to different symmetry classes of asms .",
    "it is well known that the lattice version of the quantum spin chain , the six vertex model , and the loop model are closely related  @xcite .",
    "the underlying structure accounting for this equivalence is the temperley - lieb ( tl ) algebra . in this letter",
    "we use the semigroup structure of this algebra to show that the loop model has an interpretation as a stochastic process .",
    "the groundstate wavefunction therefore gives the stationary probability distribution .",
    "while we are primarily concerned here with algebraic properties , the physical interpretation of this stochastic process is that of a fluctuating interface and is presented in @xcite .    to unify the algebraic formulation",
    "we introduce quotients of the tl algebra on a ring and on the line .",
    "we also propose new conjectures relating the stationary state with asms , or more precisely , their interpretation as fully packed loop ( fpl ) configurations @xcite . while the the fpl model is quite different from the o(@xmath3 )",
    "loop model , we will see that the loop connectivities of both models play a crucial role in these conjectures . to complete the picture",
    ", we give the finite size scaling spectra of the loop model with closed boundaries .",
    "these spectra can be expressed in terms of generic characters of a @xmath4 logarithmic conformal field theory .",
    "[ se : alg ] given an arbitrary semigroup @xmath5 , an abstract stochastic process can be defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath6 be the words of @xmath5 and consider h = _ a c_a(1-w_a)c_a0 .",
    "[ eq : ham ] in the regular representation , i.e. in the basis of all independent words in @xmath5 , @xmath7 is a matrix satisfying @xmath8 for @xmath9 and @xmath10 . such a matrix is called an intensity matrix and defines a stochastic process in continuum time given by the master equation p_a(t ) = -_b h_ab p_b(t ) [ eq : master ] where @xmath11 is the ( unnormalized ) probability to find the system in the state @xmath12 at time @xmath13 and the rate for the transition @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 , which is non - negative . in a similar way , a stochastic process can be defined on any ideal of @xmath5 . since @xmath7 is an intensity matrix it has at least one zero eigenvalue and its corresponding right eigenvector @xmath16 gives the probabilities in the stationary state    l 0h=00=(1,1,  ,1 ) + h0 = 00=_a p_aa p_a=_t p_a(t ) .",
    "[ eq : stat ] in the rest of the paper we concentrate on a particular semigroup of which there is a natural interpretation of such a stochastic process @xcite and which is solvable .",
    "we consider the particular case in which the words @xmath17 are expressed in terms of the generators @xmath18 of the temperley - lieb algebra @xmath19 @xcite e_i^2= ( q+q^-1 ) e_ie_ie_i1e_i = e_i=0|i - j|>1 [ eq : tl ] with @xmath20 .",
    "restricting ourselves to the case @xmath21 we find that the words of the tl algebra form a semigroup .",
    "the generators @xmath18 have the following graphical representation as monoids e_i =    ( 140,15 ) ( 2,-10 ) ( .5,-18)1 ( 15,-18)2 ( 38,-18)@xmath22 ( 58,-18)@xmath23 ( 72,-18)@xmath24 ( 89,-18)@xmath25 ( 117,-18)@xmath26 ( 135.5,-18)@xmath27    .",
    "[ eq : monoid ] the action of a generator on a word of the algebra is obtained by placing the graph of the generator ( [ eq : monoid ] ) under the graphical representation of the word and erasing the intermediate dashed line . in the combined graph , the loop segments either form closed loops or pairwise connect sites on the upper and lower part of a strip .",
    "the tl algebra thus can be represented by loop diagrams . due to the relations ( [ eq : tl ] ) ,",

    ", @xmath7 has a rich jordan cell structure .",
    "this can be explained using the graphical representation ( [ eq : monoid ] ) from which it is seen that the terms in the hamiltonian may connect disconnected lines but it is not possible to have the reverse process ( see @xcite for the appearance of jordan cell structures in the representations of tl algebras ) .",
    "depending on the representation , the stationary state @xmath16 may not be unique and because of the jordan cell structure we lack good quantum numbers to label sectors of @xmath7 . in this letter",
    "we will use the temperley - lieb loop ( tll ) representation as well as appropriate left ideals of the regular representation to define sectors of @xmath7 that have the same unique stationary state .",
    "the tll representation is obtained by the action of the generators in the vector space spanned by the distinct right ideals @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "because of the semigroup property , the generators @xmath18 map right ideals onto right ideals e_i ( w_at)=w_bt graphically , the right ideals are represented by link diagrams obtained from monoid diagrams by ignoring the upper parts , for @xmath31 we for example have e_1t=    ( 80,12 ) ( 0,0 ) ( -2,-10)@xmath32 ( 14,-10)@xmath33 ( 30,-10)@xmath34 ( 46,-10)@xmath35 ( 62,-10)@xmath36 ( 78,-10)@xmath37    e_2e_1e_3t=    ( 80,12 ) ( 0,0 ) ( -2,-10)@xmath32 ( 14,-10)@xmath33 ( 30,-10)@xmath34 ( 46,-10)@xmath35 ( 62,-10)@xmath36 ( 78,-10)@xmath37    the number of such link diagrams with @xmath38 defects ( unpaired links ) is c_l , m = l - l and the dimension of the vector space of right ideals is given by _ s=0^l/2 c_l,2s+(l 2 ) = ll/2 .",
