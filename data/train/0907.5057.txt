    "the classical isoperimetric problem says that the sphere is the unique surface of a given area which encloses the maximal volume ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , when the area is substituted with other functionals of the intrinsic metric , the uniqueness disappears and the problem becomes very difficult and sometimes intractable .",
    "in this paper we study the geometry of _ inflated surfaces _ , defined as the surfaces  @xmath0 of maximal volume among all embedded surfaces homeomorphic to a sphere whose intrinsic metric is a submetric to the intrinsic metric of  @xmath0 . in other words",
    ", we require that for every surface  @xmath1 homeomorphic to  @xmath0 if all geodesic distances between points in  @xmath1 are less or equal to the geodesic distances between the corresponding points in  @xmath0 , then the volume of  @xmath1 is less or equal to that of  @xmath0 .",
    "this notion was originally introduced by bleecker  @xcite , and further studied in  @xcite .",
    "of course , every sphere is an inflated surface , since the smaller geodesic distances imply smaller surface area .",
    "however , not every convex surface is an inflated surface ; in fact , very few of them are .",
    "for example , it was shown in  @xcite that not all ellipsoids with distinct axes are inflated surfaces , and possibly none of them are . to see an example of this phenomenon , consider a nearly flat ellipsoid  @xmath0 , with two large equal axes and one very small one .",
    "think of the surface of  @xmath0 as of non - stretchable closed balloon and blow some air into it .",

    "the idea behind inflated surfaces is to start with a given surface  @xmath2 and blow air into it until no longer possible .",
    "the resulting surface  @xmath3 will be the inflated surface , and will typically be non - convex and not everywhere smooth even if  @xmath2 was convex and smooth .",
    "also , in the limit the geodesic distances can ( and typically do ) become smaller in  @xmath0 than in  @xmath2 , so the inflated surface  @xmath0 ( perhaps , counterintuitively ) has larger volume and smaller area than  @xmath2",
    ". see sections  [ s : examples ] ,  [ s : final ] and  @xcite for many examples and conjectures on inflated surfaces .",
    "unfortunately , little is known about uniqueness and regularity of inflated surfaces , even in the most simple cases .",
    "we are motivated by  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) , where the shape of a _ mylar balloon _ was computed , defined as the inflated surface of a doubly covered disc ( glued along the boundary circle ) . in this case",
    "the symmetry can be utilized to obtain a complete profile by solving a one - dimensional variational problem .",
    "we consider a large class of almost everywhere flat convex surfaces with a plane symmetry .",
    "examples include doubly covered regular polygons , cubes ( or more general brick surfaces ) , other platonic and archimedean solids , etc .",
    "we then use tools from classical differential geometry and certain heuristic assumptions to compute the _ profile _ of the corresponding inflated surfaces , defined as the shape of the curve in the symmetry plane .",
    "we show that there is essentially one parametric family of such profiles , which are all solutions of a special third order differential equation .",
    "given the variety of examples which include the mylar balloon , this result may again seem counterintuitive .",

    "if this curvature were zero at @xmath197 , it would imply that this curve is the same ( up to dilation ) as the profile of the mylar balloon .",

    "we still call @xmath186 the centers of the two copies of the regular polygon , and @xmath199 their vertices ( pairwise identified ) .",
    "the inflated double @xmath109-polygon is the copy of @xmath200 triangles , each of which is @xmath201 .",
    "we make the same hypothesis as for the square pillow , and obtain a profile shape which again only depends on one parameter , for instance the curvature of the profile at @xmath186 , as for the square pillow ( which is obviously a special case ) .",
    "let us start now with the surface @xmath202 or a unit cube  @xmath203 .",
    "using the same analysis , each face of the inflated cube is cut into four triangles and we can assume that each of them is @xmath5  smooth . under this hypothesis",
    "we find that the intersection of the inflated cube with a plane of symmetry containing no vertex is the union of four arcs of  @xmath161 , for some  @xmath196 .",
    "it might appear at first sight that the model considered here , based on contracting embeddings of a surface with maximal volume , is quite different from what happens for true inflated surfaces .",
    "indeed for those surfaces there is no contraction of the metric on the surface , but rather some `` plaids '' appear ( see the wrinkles in figure  [ f : balloons ] ) .",
    "one feature of those plaids is that they are necessarily along geodesics on the surface , and this seems to impose a constraint not present in the mathematical model .",
    "however , there is a very good fit between the mathematical models and the inflated surfaces as they are observed .",
    "we believe that the resolution of this apparent paradox lies in parts @xmath41 and  @xmath43 of claim  3.1 .",
    "these parts state precisely that the integral curves of the non - contracted directions are geodesics on the surface .",
    "in other terms , there is a mathematical constraint , coming from the maximality of the surface , which happens to coincide precisely with the physical constraints that the plaids have to be along lines .",
    "for this reason the `` mathematical '' inflated surfaces are very close to the observed ones , in spite of apparently different constraints on their geometry .",
    "perhaps the main open problem is to show that the inflated surfaces are well defined and uniquely determined ( see  @xcite for a complete statement ) .",
    "presumably , this would imply the symmetry assumptions we made throughout the paper .",
    "unfortunately , even in the case of the mylar balloon or rectangular pillow this is completely open .",
    "it would also be important to prove the regularity conditions , in particular a formal proof of claim  3.1 .    even under the uniqueness and regularity conditions",
    ", this paper goes only so far towards understanding of the inflated pillow shapes . although we do not wish to suggest that in the case of rectangular pillows the shape of the surface can be expressed by means of classical functions , as in the case of the mylar balloon  @xcite , it is perhaps possible that it is a solution of an elegant problem which completely defines it .",
    "for example , the linearity of the curvature as in proposition  [ p : linear ] completely characterizes the mylar balloon",
    ". it would be interesting if the shape of rectangular pillows has a similar characterization .    finally , the _ crimping density _ and _ crimping ratio _",
    "( the ratio of the area of inflated over non - inflated surface defined in  @xcite ) are interesting notions with potential applications to material science .",
    "exploring them in the case of rectangular pillows would be of great interest .",
