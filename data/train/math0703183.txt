    "in the work of bobenko and springborn @xcite , they produced a variational principle for circle patterns on surfaces in euclidean and hyperbolic geometry .",
    "the goal of this paper is to give two different proofs of bobenko and springborn s theorem .",
    "first we will give a direct proof of bobenko and springborn s theorem in euclidean and hyperbolic geometry by using the continuity method used by thurston @xcite , marden and rodin @xcite .",
    "then we will use another variational principle following rivin s strategy @xcite @xcite to prove bobenko and springborn s theorem in hyperbolic geometry .",
    "bobenko and springborn s proof consists of two steps . in the first step they use the feasible flow to find the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an angle structure ( i.e.coherent angle system ) . in the second step they introduced an energy function",
    "whose variables are radii of circles and they can show that the unique critical point of the energy function corresponds to circle pattern with prescribed intersection angles and cone angles .",
    "this variational principle is first used by colin de verdire @xcite in the proof of andreev - thurston s circle packing theorem in euclidean and hyperbolic geometry .",

    "the cone metric on a triangulated surface , rivin produced a variational principle .",
    "rivin @xcite used the duality theorem in linear programming to find the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an angle structure .",
    "rivin @xcite introduced an energy function whose variables are certain angles and he can show the unique maximal point of the energy function corresponds to the angle structure induced by a cone metric . following rivin s method , leibon @xcite characterized the hyperbolic cone metric .",
    "for the spherical cone metric , the angle structure part was solved by the author @xcite and the energy function part was solved by luo @xcite .",
    "we will show that rivin s strategy also works in the circle pattern problem .",
    "our energy function is the legendre transformation of the energy function in bobenko and springborn @xcite .",
