    "erbium - doped lithium niobate ( er@xmath0:linbo@xmath1 ) features a wide , inhomogeneously broadened transition within the c - band of the current telecommunication infrastructure @xcite .",
    "this is desirable for high - bandwidth applications such as quantum memories @xcite or classical information processing devices , e.g. pulse ordering that would seamlessly integrate with today s technology .",
    "furthermore , lithium niobate is of particular interest due to its strong electro - optic effects @xcite that enable amplitude and phase modulation of light , as well as its high refractive index that can be readily modified to enable optical waveguide applications @xcite .",
    "the optical coherence properties of the 1.5 micron transition of bulk er@xmath0:linbo@xmath1crystals have also been studied for optical signal processing and quantum information applications @xcite , providing a knowledge base for comparing with any changes in the properties of micro- and nano - structured materials .    for many photonic applications ,",
    "there is a strong trend towards miniaturization of devices with the ultimate goal of on - chip implementation and integration of many optical components .",
    "nanofabrication tools such as chemical etching @xcite and focused ion beam milling @xcite are already available and numerous nano - scale devices have been fabricated specifically from linbo@xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , employing linbo@xmath1 crystalline films with thicknesses of only a few microns can provide advantages for the design of next generation high - speed , broadband electro - optic modulators @xcite as well as providing a platform for integration of heterogeneous photonic structures and components @xcite . as fabrication techniques",
    "are refined further , additional improvements may be achieved by employing micron - sized ridge waveguide structures , such as for enhanced optical frequency conversion @xcite .",
    "nanostructured linbo@xmath1 is of interest for diverse applications such as nanocrystals for in situ biological imaging @xcite or nano - wires for directional optical second - harmonic generation @xcite and enhanced pyroelectric sensors @xcite .",
    "these materials are also promising for nanoscale ferroelectric capacitors that can enable high - density non - volatile data storage @xcite .",
    "while much progress has been made in recent years on nanofabrication of optical materials , little is known about how fabrication processes affect the spectroscopic properties of resonant impurities in the host , such as rare - earth ions .",
    "many properties can be sensitive to the quality of the host crystal , and even modest variations can critically affect applications that rely on those properties .",
    "consequently , it is important to find ways to maintain those properties in nanoscale structures .    in the specific area of rei - doped powders and nanocrystals ,",
    "there have been very few optical coherence studies .",
    "the initial work in this field focused on the specific case of eu@xmath0-doped into sesquioxide host crystals , where fluorescence detection of spectral hole burning revealed rapid decoherence relative to the bulk crystals due to the introduction of glass - like two - level system ( tls ) dynamics in the powders @xcite . beyond the sesquioxide powders , nano - crystallites in glass ceramics",
    "have also suffered from rapid decoherence processes due primarily to interactions with the surrounding amorphous host matrix @xcite . following the pioneering demonstrations of photon echo measurements on highly scattering powders @xcite , optical coherence properties approaching those of bulk crystals",
    "have recently been demonstrated in eu : y@xmath2o@xmath1 nano powders , confirming that there is significant potential to improve these and other nano - materials @xcite .",
    "in addition , long optical coherence times have been reported for micro - fabricated structures in nd : y@xmath2sio@xmath3 crystals , again suggesting that at least some systems and fabrication methods can produce properties suitable for practical applications @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , beyond these cases , little is known about optical coherence in nano- and micro - structured crystals or powders .    with this motivation ,",
    "the focus of the work reported here is to employ high - resolution optical characterization methods , namely two - pulse photon echo ( 2pe ) , spectral hole burning ( shb ) , and free induction decay ( fid ) techniques , to assess optical coherence lifetimes in micro- and nano - sized powders of er@xmath0-doped lithium niobate .",
    "the greatest challenges in carrying out these studies involve detecting optically coherent signals in highly scattering media and the complexity in behavior introduced by the random orientation of crystallites in the powder relative to both the external magnetic field and light polarization , which crucially influence the spectroscopic properties .",
    "in addition , we find that the bulk crystal properties degrade significantly with any mechanical processing used to obtain micro / nanocrystals .",
    "therefore , techniques with a very large measurement dynamic range are necessary .    as a primary goal , our study seeks to probe the thresholds where low - energy mechanical processing methods begin to degrade the optical coherence properties and to what extent the effects might be reversed by high - temperature annealing .",
    "in addition to the direct relevance to nano- and micro - fabrication , these results can also reveal insights into potential surface damage introduced by cutting , grinding , and polishing as well as what processing steps may be successful in reducing the resulting surface strain and defects .",
    "another important goal is to demonstrate that powders of highly anisotropic materials may be quantitatively analyzed within the framework of decoherence models developed for bulk single crystals .",
    "finally , this work demonstrates how combinations of 2pe , shb , and fid measurement techniques allow optical coherence properties to be studied and compared across a range of samples with very different behaviors as described in the following .",
    "the following section of this paper describes the fabrication of our powder samples .",
    "we then discuss and compare the results of the different experimental methods to probe the optical coherence lifetimes .",
    "the properties of the fabricated powders are then compared with the ones of a bulk crystal , including quantitative modeling of the effects due to the random orientation of crystallites in the powder .",
    "we identify the factors limiting the optical coherence lifetimes in small crystals and show that high - temperature annealing to relieve strain induced by the fabrication process can improve those properties ; however , in the majority of samples , the bulk crystal properties could not be preserved or fully recovered .",
    "mechanical grinding is a very general , simple , rapid , and flexible approach for fabricating nano - powders from bulk crystalline materials . in particular ,",
    "high - energy planetary ball milling has been extensively used to produce monodisperse nano - powders with crystallite sizes down to less than 10 nm @xcite . however , it is known that high - energy ball milling can cause significant damage to the crystal structure , with the resulting disorder leading to amorphous - like behavior or even transformations to different crystal phases after extended milling @xcite . since",
    "very large internal electric fields can be produced through the piezoelectric and pyroelectric effects in linbo@xmath1 @xcite , which are also known to contribute to optical damage processes in the bulk crystals @xcite , we might expect even greater potential for crystal damage from high - energy milling of this material .",
    "high - energy ball milling has been used by a number of groups to produce linbo@xmath1 nanopowders , mostly undoped , and the resulting materials have been extensively characterized @xcite .",
    "a range of techniques including nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy , extended x - ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy , impedance spectroscopy , x - ray diffraction , transmission electron microscopy , differential scanning calorimetry , thermogravimetic analysis , infrared absorption spectroscopy , and raman spectroscopy have all indicated a significant increase in amorphous behavior in the linbo@xmath1 crystallites when they are reduced to sizes below 100 nm by high - energy ball milling @xcite .",
    "very little is known regarding how the extent of crystal damage caused by mechanical fabrication or processing relates to the energy , processing time , and specific method used .",
    "while it is clear that the extended high - energy milling required to produce nanocrystalline powders produces significant damage , it is unknown if the damage is intrinsically linked to the size reduction or whether lower energy grinding methods might better preserve the properties of the bulk crystal . for linbo@xmath1 ,",
    "some of the same measurements that reveal the large degradation in nanocrystals indicate that microcrystals have nearly the same properties as the bulk crystal @xcite . in our previous shb studies of tm@xmath0-doped yttrium aluminum garnet powders",
    ", we found that high - energy planetary ball milling dramatically affected @xmath4tm@xmath0 nuclear hyperfine state lifetimes ; however , we also found that the lifetimes were still significantly reduced in relatively large microcrystals produced by low - energy ball milling @xcite .",
    "since we expect crystal defects introduced by grinding to affect optical coherence properties more strongly than nuclear spin lifetimes due to the stronger coupling of the electronic states to the crystal lattice , optical coherence measurements should provide a uniquely sensitive method for probing even very low levels of crystal damage .",
    "for the same reasons , we might expect mechanical fabrication methods to be particularly detrimental to material performance in applications that rely on long coherence lifetimes and narrow optical homogeneous linewidths .",
    "consequently , in this work we only used very slow and low - energy grinding methods in an attempt to minimize the accumulated mechanical strain in the crystallites and also probe the threshold for introducing measurable damage to the crystal structure .",
    "as a single crystal reference to compare with powder samples prepared in different ways , we chose a bulk single crystal of 0.1% er@xmath0:linbo@xmath1with congruent composition , grown by scientific materials corp .",
    "( smc ) using the czochralski method .",
    "this crystal has been previously studied by thiel et al .",
    "@xcite and showed good coherence properties with homogeneous linewidths as narrow as 3 khz with applied magnetic fields along the crystal s @xmath5-axis .",
    "the choice of doping concentration is a trade - off between the absorption needed to obtain a reasonable signal - to - noise ratio in powder samples and the additional decoherence created by increased doping due to er@xmath0-er@xmath0 interactions .",
    "starting from a bulk crystal , we fabricated several powder samples , as detailed below .",
    "the procedures used to fabricate each of the samples are outlined in tab .",
    "[ tab : fab ] . in order to analyze the size and shape distribution of the resulting powders , we performed scanning electron microscope ( sem ) imaging , as presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : sempicsunp ] and  [ fig : sempicsproc ] .",
    "bulk & 0.1 % er@xmath0:linbo@xmath1(smc ) + 1 ( ref ) & bulk crushed via mortar and pestle + 2 &    .powders characterized in the manuscript and their fabrication methods .",
    "[ cols= \" < \" , ]     from the values in tab .  [ tab : hb ]",
    ", we see that powder # 1 , which was crushed using only a mortar and pestle , shows broader hole widths than the bulk crystal , meaning that additional spectral diffusion processes occur in this powder .",
    "remarkably , the effective homogeneous linewidth of powder # 3 , which was ball - milled and then annealed , is narrower , and on the same order of magnitude as that of the bulk crystal .",
    "this indicates that crystal damage ( strain and defects ) caused by mechanical processing , in this case crushing using a mortar and pestle and slow ball milling , could be mostly removed by annealing the powder with the smallest particle sizes studied of roughly 2 @xmath6 m and lower . on the other hand ,",
    "powder # 4 shows much broader spectral holes with the same mechanical processing as powder # 3 but annealing at a higher temperature . to further explore the effect of temperature , powder # 5 was ball milled at a higher speed and for a longer time than powders # 3 and # 4 , but",
    "was then annealed at the same upper temperature as powder # 4 , resulting in very large spectral hole widths  nearly the same as for powder # 4 .",
    "these results suggest that the much broader linewidths observed in powders # 4 and # 5 arise from the higher annealing temperatures .",
    "consequently , it appears that temperatures above 1000  c are detrimental to the material properties rather than beneficial , likely due to additional disorder caused by loss of either lithium or oxygen from the crystal matrix .",
    "this hypothesis is consistent with past observations of substantial lithium out - diffusion from the surface of bulk crystals when annealed in a wet oxygen atmosphere at temperatures above approximately 1100  c @xcite .",
    "moreover , changes in material properties due to lithium out - diffusion have been observed at temperatures as low as 600  c for linbo@xmath1 thin films @xcite , suggesting that even lower annealing temperatures than used here may be optimal for micro / nano - powders .    finally , we examined powder # 6 that was fabricated through in - diffusion of erbium into commercial linbo@xmath1 powder .",
    "this powder was processed using similar mechanical and thermal treatments as for powders # 4 and # 5 , although noticeably narrower linewidths than those of powders # 4 and # 5 were observed .",
    "further study is required to determine whether the difference in linewidth is a result of the different starting materials , the presence of ercl@xmath1 mixed with the powder , or other factors .    from the hole burning spectra",
    ", we also extracted effective absorption depths for each powder sample .",
    "since scattering in the powder increases the optical path length traveled by the light as it passes through the sample , we should observe a larger absorption depth for samples with more scattering , as well as the expected increase in the overall frequency - independent scattering loss . on the other hand , scattering of light between and around",
    "loosely packed particles will reduce the absorption compared to a bulk crystal .",
    "in particular , any small gap in the 0.4  mm thick loose powder can result in a weakly scattered background signal that does not strongly probe the powder .",
    "furthermore , when the individual crystallites have anisotropic absorption , the transmitted light in general will not follow the usual beer - lambert - bouguer exponential decay law . nevertheless ,",
    "if we assume that the incident light polarization is randomized many times during the scattering process , as we observe experimentally from the transmitted light , then we can approximate the propagation through the powder using the absorption coefficient averaged over all polarizations states .",
    "thus , while it is difficult to extract real absorption coefficients or effective path lengths from the measured transmission spectrum , we do expect the observed `` effective '' absorption to provide some qualitative information about the relative scattering path lengths in the powder samples .",
    "for the 1532 nm transition of er@xmath0:linbo@xmath1 , the absorption coefficient is dependent on both the polarization and the propagation direction of the light since the transition has comparable electric and magnetic transition dipole strengths @xcite .",
    "the maximum absorption coefficients are known for light propagating orthogonally to the crystals @xmath5-axis with @xmath7 polarization , i.e. @xmath8 ( 4.1 @xmath9 ) , and @xmath10 polarization , i.e. @xmath11 ( 6.8 @xmath9 ) , as well as for the light propagating along the crystals @xmath5-axis with the two circular polarization states ( 11.1 @xmath9 averaged over left and right handed polarizations ) .",
    "consequently , averaging over all possible random crystal orientations and polarizations , we would expect an effective absorption coefficient @xmath12 of 7.3 @xmath9 for a powder in the limit of many scattering events .    to estimate the `` effective '' absorption coefficient @xmath12 for each powder sample , we used high - power ( resonant ) optical excitation to burn a very deep spectral hole for which we assumed complete transparency since further increasing the burning power did not produce any additional increase in the transmission .",
    "using this approach , @xmath12 was calculated from the transmitted intensity @xmath13 at the center of the hole and the intensity @xmath14 with the laser tuned away from the hole ( where it experiences the full absorption ) through the relation @xmath15 where @xmath16  mm is the powder thickness .",
    "the resulting effective absorption values are listed in tab .  [ tab : hb ] for each sample .    for powders # 1 and # 3 we measured absorption coefficients ( see tab .",
    "[ tab : hb ] ) higher than the bulk average increased by a factor of 1.8 and 1.3 respectively .",
    "this is consistent with the transmitted light experiencing a longer path in the powder sample .",
    "however , for the other powder samples , the measured absorption coefficient is significantly lower compared to the bulk .",
    "we note that all powders with small optical depth ( # 4 to # 6 ) underwent the same annealing procedure , with maximum temperatures of around 1100  c , which might have introduced modifications in the host matrix that potentially could cause broadening of the inhomogeneous linewidth or other effects responsible for decreased absorption .",
    "this explanation would also be consistent with our observation of larger effective homogeneous linewidths in those same samples .",
    "nevertheless , to conclusively identify the cause of the weaker observed spectral hole depths in these samples requires further study .",
    "the experiment described above shows that shb measurements in direct transmission could be successfully conducted in powder samples and that the effective linewidths were successfully extracted in samples for which 2pe measurements could not be performed .",
    "overall , we observed that coherence properties degraded in powders that underwent mechanical processing .",
    "this suggests the presence of two - level systems in these samples . to further verify these results",
    ", we also used fid techniques to probe the coherence properties over an intermediate range that overlaps those accessible through shb and 2pe measurements .",
    "shb measurements may be used to probe powders with broad homogeneous linewidths that can not be accessed by 2pe techniques . however , in cases where rapid spectral diffusion or complex spectral structure such as spin - flip sidebands are present , optical coherent transient fid measurements can serve as a better method to extract the effective homogeneous linewidth @xcite . while fid measurements that probe a single spectral hole are still limited by the laser linewidth , fid may be employed immediately following the hole preparation without the need for laser chirping , allowing the broadening to be probed over shorter timescales than frequency domain shb measurements",
    ". furthermore , fid s are more amenable to heterodyne detection techniques , allowing for improved signal discrimination and dynamic range relative to shb .",
    "the shape of the fid curve also reveals the evolution of decoherence processes over the timescale of the measurement in a manner similar to 2pe techniques @xcite , unlike direct shb that requires an extensive series of measurements to extract similar information .",
    "t , @xmath17  k and waiting time @xmath18  @xmath6s .",
    "solid points are measured values and the solid line is a fit of the fid signal . the inset shows a magnification of the first 1 @xmath6s of the decay . ]    motivated by the ability of fid measurements to probe rapid decoherence processes contributing to the homogeneous linewidth ( i.e. processes faster than the shortest timescales observable using 2pes ) , we employed fid measurements to study all of our powder samples .",
    "specifically , we applied a variation of the fid technique sometimes referred to as a `` delayed '' fid that is analogous to a stimulated photon echo measurement @xcite . for this approach , a laser pulse first burnt a hole in the inhomogeneously broadened absorption line of the sample : in our case we used a 50 @xmath6s long burn pulse to provide an approximately 20 khz fourier - limited spectral resolution .",
    "after a waiting time @xmath19 , a second brief excitation pulse was applied to induce an optical coherence across the frequency window of the burnt hole .",
    "the decay of the coherent emission after the brief pulse provides information about the effective width of the spectral hole resulting from the convolution of the effective homogeneous linewidth and the laser linewidth , as well as any spectral diffusion that occurs over the waiting time @xmath19 . in our case , we employed heterodyne detection to measure the coherence decay by beating it with a third laser pulse shifted in frequency by 10 mhz .",
    "the decay of the resulting 10 mhz beat signal is given by @xmath20   \\ ; .",
    "\\label{eq : fiddec}\\ ] ] by fitting this equation to the experimentally measured decay , we extracted the effective homogeneous linewidth @xmath21 after a waiting time @xmath19 . an exemplary fid decay signal for powder # 1 ( reference ) at @xmath22",
    "t , @xmath17  k and waiting time @xmath23 @xmath6s is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fiddec ] , where the steady - state transmitted intensity has been subtracted from the signal .",
    "the fit of the fid is shown by the solid line , revealing an exponential decay envelope ( i.e. @xmath24 in eq .",
    "[ eq : fiddec ] ) that corresponds to an effective linewidth of @xmath25  khz .    by changing the waiting time @xmath19 between the burn and excitation pulses ,",
    "the delayed fid technique was used to determine the effective homogeneous linewidth at different timescales and thus study time - dependent decoherence processes , i.e. spectral diffusion .",
    "the effective homogeneous linewidth over a range of waiting times for different powders is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fiddiff ] . from a comparison of the obtained effective homogeneous linewidths using fid at @xmath23 @xmath6s and the local slope of the two pulse photon echo decay around @xmath26 @xmath6s for each powder , we estimated the experimental contribution to each fid measurement due to laser linewidth , power broadening and shot - to - shot laser jitter .",
    "t and b ) @xmath27  t at @xmath28  k as a function of the waiting time @xmath19 measured using the delayed fid technique for powders # 1 , # 3 through # 6 and for the bulk crystal .",
    "the solid lines are guides to the eye . ]    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fiddiff ] , we observed a rapid time - dependent broadening of the linewidth due to spectral diffusion occurring at timescales of less than 500 @xmath6s , and then a saturation of the broadening at longer timescales , indicating that those waiting times were longer than the inverse of the spectral diffusion rate . comparing the behaviors at @xmath29  t and @xmath22  t ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fiddiff](a ) and ( b ) ) indicates that spectral diffusion is faster at 2 t , whereas the final linewidth at long @xmath19 is similar at both magnetic fields .",
    "overall , the bulk crystal shows the narrowest linewidths , although powder # 1 ( the reference powder ) that underwent minimal grinding using only a mortar and pestle exhibits similar spectral diffusion broadening as the bulk crystal at the longest time delays .",
    "all ball - milled powders show significantly larger effective linewidths . for powders # 3 and # 4 that underwent the same mechanical treatment ,",
    "the data points at short @xmath19 suggest that the higher annealing temperature of 1100  c for powder # 4 was detrimental .",
    "furthermore , we could not observe a clear saturation of the effective homogeneous linewidth with waiting time for powder # 4 , unlike all of the other powders .",
    "powder # 5 that experienced more severe mechanical treatment ( fast ball milling for 10 hours ) but the same annealing process as # 4 , shows comparable broadening as # 4 , further suggesting that the high annealing temperature was the limiting factor for these samples .",
    "this observation is consistent with the shb results discussed earlier and again points toward defects and disorder in the crystal caused by out - diffusion of lithium at high temperatures @xcite .",
    "since the dynamic tls modes enabled by the disorder typically exhibit a broad distribution of relaxation rates , they are expected to cause significant spectral diffusion that often produces a logarithmic increase in the homogeneous linewidth over time @xcite .",
    "the commercial powder with large crystallites that were diffusion - doped with er@xmath0 ( powder # 6 ) exhibited better coherence properties at long timescales compared to all of the ball - milled powders , although still significantly worse than the bulk crystal and the crushed reference powder # 1 .",
    "this again suggests that higher processing temperatures are a key factor in producing spectral diffusion , although at a lower level for larger particles as might be expected if lithium out - diffusion is the cause .",
    "we demonstrated that spectroscopic properties such as optical coherence lifetimes in er@xmath0:linbo@xmath1powders that experienced various mechanical and thermal treatments could be measured despite strong scattering , random orientations , and shorter coherence lifetimes .",
    "the 2pe measurements were optimal to access long coherence lifetimes whereas shb and fid techniques were well suited to quantify fast dephasing processes .",
    "furthermore , we described how the powder properties could be predicted and understood by averaging the orientation dependent properties of the bulk single crystal .",
    "we observed that mechanical grinding of the powders resulted in a broadening of their effective homogeneous linewidths , indicating the presence of dynamic tls modes characteristic of amorphous phases .",
    "this conclusion was also supported by observations of corresponding decreases in the maximum absorption as well as a broader distribution of spectral diffusion rates as compared to the bulk crystal .",
    "surprisingly , we found that even crushing and grinding with mortar and pestle to produce large microcrystals resulted in significant damage as indicated by an order - of - magnitude increase in the homogeneous linewidth . in the powders that experienced less processing , spectral diffusion broadening at longer timescales approached the values observed in the bulk , suggesting that grinding primarily accelerates existing spectral diffusion mechanisms ( such as er@xmath0 electronic spin flips ) rather than introducing new sources of broadening .",
    "this conclusion is also consistent with the increase in the magnetic - fielddependent spectral diffusion rates extracted from analysis of the 2pe coherence measurements ( summarized in tab .",
    "[ tab : fitparameters ] ) .",
    "we found that the broadening could be partially reversed by high - temperature annealing in oxygen atmospheres for some powders ; however , treatment at temperatures above 1000 c was detrimental for the coherence properties .",
    "the powders annealed at temperatures above 1000 c exhibited a large increase in the magnitude of spectral diffusion , suggesting that additional broadening mechanisms were introduced , possibly due to out - diffusion of lithium and oxygen from the crystallites .",
    "together , our results demonstrate that even minimal low - energy mechanical processing significantly degrades the material properties of interest for classical and quantum signal - processing applications .",
    "chemical fabrication methods , such as chemical synthesis or etching may minimize the amount of amorphous - like behavior introduced when fabricating micro- and nano - materials and lead to better optical coherence properties .",
    "this hypothesis is consistent with past structural and spectroscopic studies of nanocrystalline linbo@xmath1 where powders produced by sol - gel methods had significantly better properties than those produced by high - energy ball milling @xcite , although still not reaching the bulk crystal properties @xcite .",
    "the detrimental effects of high annealing temperatures also suggest that lower temperature bottom - up synthesis may be preferred .",
    "the demonstration of long coherence lifetimes in eu : y@xmath2o@xmath1 nanopowders produced using solvothermal methods confirms that at least some materials can be fabricated with optical coherence properties approaching those of the bulk crystal @xcite .",
    "based on the recent work on nd : y@xmath2sio@xmath3 @xcite , we expect that focused - ion - beam milling may also be successful in preserving the coherence properties of rei - doped linbo@xmath1 , potentially providing a suitable tool to fabricate micro- and nano - structures for optical signal - processing applications .",
    "nevertheless , further studies are required to determine whether there are other fundamental limitations of material performance when the crystal size is reduced to the nanoscale .",
