    "here we investigate the growth of the _ c. elegans _",
    "connectome , from the moment of fertilization through hatching of the egg and larval elongation to adulthood  @xcite .",
    "importantly , we note that the physical distances between neurons increase as a function of the increasing overall length of the worm s body as it matures ; see figure  [ fig : fig1]a .",
    "the cells of the adult nervous system are concentrated in the head and the tail of the worm , with a series of neurons running along the length of the body to innervate local muscle groups ( the ventral cord ) .",
    "this system can be decomposed into @xmath3 ganglia ( or neuronal groups ) based on anatomical properties  @xcite ; see figure  [ fig : fig1]b .",
    "the birth times of each neuron tend to cluster in two time windows , separated by a `` quiet '' period which includes the time of hatching ( @xmath4 minutes after fertilization ) ; see figure  [ fig : fig1]c .",
    "the developmental changes in the number of nodes ( @xmath5 ) and edges ( @xmath6 ) in the network occur in the context of progressive elongation of the worm s body , from less than @xmath7 before hatching to more than @xmath8 in the adult .",
    "the two growth spurts in neuronal number , before and after hatching , are paralleled by a roughly synchronous increase in the total number of synaptic connections between neurons ( figure  [ fig : fig1]c ) .",
    "however , the form of the relationship between @xmath5 and @xmath6 is evidently different before and after hatching , as shown in figure  [ fig : fig1]d .",
    "the initial increase in @xmath6 is well described by a _",
    "quadratic _ function of @xmath5 , implying that the average node degree increases linearly as the network grows ( see inset ) .",
    "then , at @xmath9 , hatching takes place , marking the metamorphic change of the worm from egg to larva .",
    "this event coincides with a discontinuous change in growth rules : after hatching , @xmath6 increases _ linearly _ with @xmath5 , so that the average node degree remains constant .",
    "this experimental evidence suggests that sharp qualitative changes can indeed affect the growth rules governing the development and the formation of complex networks  @xcite . in this case",
    ", the transition from one growth regime to another coincides with a metamorphic change of the worm , from egg to larva .    while it is tempting to assume that it is a biological `` trigger '' or discontinuity associated with hatching that underlies the emergence of this biphasic growth curve , here we have assessed the ability of several simple and continuous models of network formation to reproduce this observed behavior without incorporating further biological detail ; see figure  [ fig : fig2 ] and methods .",
    "we deliberately decided to restrict ourselves to stochastic one - parameter models .",
    "firstly , because our aim was to isolate the fundamental ingredients which could be responsible for the observed discontinuous growth ; secondly because , as we show in the following , a one - parameter model was indeed enough to reproduce both the biphasic growth and many of the structural properties of the adult _ c. elegans _ neuronal network .",
    "the first model we considered was the linear preferential attachment model , introduced by barabsi & albert ( ba )  @xcite , which has been successfully employed to describe the development of many different complex networks , from the world wide web to the internet and citation networks . the ba model assumes that the growth of a network is driven only by its topological properties : specifically , newborn neurons are more likely to form connections to neurons that are already well connected .",
    "this model predicts a linear relationship between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , which matches closely the post - hatching phase of worm brain development but does not provide a satisfactory fit to the pre - hatching phase .",
    "conversely , the binomial accelerated growth ( bag ) model , which assumes that the probability of a connection between a new neuron and any pre - existing neuron is constant , predicts that @xmath6 increases as a quadratic function of @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "similarly , we observe a quadratic dependence of @xmath6 on @xmath5 also in a modified version of accelerated growth ( hag ) , which additionally reproduces the node degree distribution of the adult worm . accelerated growth models",
    "are thus able to reproduce the pre - hatching phase of the worm brain s growth but fail to accommodate the transition to linear scaling of @xmath6 with @xmath5 in the post - hatching phase .",
    "we found that economical trade - off models , that take into account the spatial location of neurons while allowing for some long distance connections to high degree nodes , were able to reproduce biphasic growth more accurately .",
    "as a first approximation , we defined the economical spatial growth ( esg ) model , which assumes that the probability of a connection forming between newborn neuron @xmath10 and pre - existing neuron @xmath11 is a product of the degree of the @xmath11th node in the adult nervous system , and a decreasing exponential function of the euclidean distance @xmath12 between nodes @xmath10 and @xmath11 in the adult worm .",
    "although the modeled growth exhibits two phases , the transition between quadratic and linear phases occurs before hatching .        therefore , we considered a more refined economical spatio - temporal growth model ( estg ) , where @xmath13 is estimated by the euclidean distance between neurons @xmath10 and @xmath11 at the time of birth of the newborn neuron , thereby adjusting for the fact that the connection distance between any pair of neurons will be shorter at earlier stages of development before the worm becomes elongated .",
    "we extrapolated the position of each neuron during growth from its position in the adult worm , assuming that each neuron s position was shifted along the longitudinal axis in proportion to the overall changes in body length ( see figure 1a ) which we collated from the literature  @xcite ( for the pre - hatching stage ) and  @xcite ( after hatching ) , using a linear interpolation between larval stages  @xcite . while the penalty on connection distance remains fixed in this model , its effect on connectivity as a function of the overall scaling of the system is dynamically evolving",
    "indeed , the trade - off between distance and topological degree is increasingly biased in favor of minimizing connection distance as development proceeds and the worm becomes longer overall .",
    "the model provides an excellent fit to the two observed scalings of @xmath6 as function of @xmath5 in the biological data , including a good approximation of the moment of hatching to the transition point from one growth regime to the other .",
    "this suggests that the discontinuity in the growth curve is not explained by biological triggers related to hatching but is instead a consequence of the spatial properties of the system .",
    "in particular , the average distance of newly born neurons relative to all other neurons is much greater after hatching , so that the distance penalty term begins to dominate the trade - off embodied in the spatial growth rules .",
    "this is especially obvious in the estg model , where the worm s elongation causes distances to increase in the interim between the two bursts of neurogenesis .",
    "note , however , that a transition is already visible in the esg model .",
    "this can be explained by noting that most neurons born after hatching are located along the body of the worm rather than in the head ( see appendix section  s1 and fig .",
    "s1 ) , so that the average distance between these newly born neurons and all others is again increased after hatching .",
    "we have also tested the ability of other one - parameter models to reproduce the observed growth curve ( see appendix section  s2 ) ; in particular , we tried to encode the cost of long connections through a power - law decay instead of an exponential one , but none of the alternative models was able to accommodate the abrupt change in the functional relation between @xmath6 and @xmath5 with the same accuracy obtained by estg ( see appendix section  s4 , table  s - ii and fig .",
    "the economical spatio - temporal growth model also provides a good account of several other features of the adult nervous system s organization , including the statistical distributions of node degree , node efficiency , and edge length in the adult worm brain ( see figure  [ fig : fig3 ] ) . according to the results obtained through the computation of the symmetrized kullback - leibler divergence , estg is the model which most closely reproduces the distributions of node degree , edge length and node efficiency ( see appendix section  s5 , table  s - iii and fig .",
    "s3 , s4 and s5 ) .",
    "moreover , the model can provide a reasonable account of finer - grained details of the adult system , such as the anatomical variation in the average node degree and nodal efficiency along the length of the worm .",
    "networks simulated by the model also had a mesoscopic structure which closely resembled the pattern of clustered connectivity between neurons belonging to one of 10 ganglia previously defined on biological grounds .",
    "neurons belonging to the same ganglion in the worm brain tend to have high connectivity with each other and relatively sparse connectivity to neurons in other ganglia  @xcite .",
    "this biological pattern and the neurons belonging to each specific ganglion were quite accurately reproduced by the economical spatio - temporal growth model ( figure  [ fig : fig3 ] ) .",
    "we have shown that a fairly simple economical model was adequate to account for many aspects of the spatial and topological development of the nervous system of the nematode worm , _ c. elegans_. we describe this generative model as economical because it represents the formation of synaptic connections probabilistically as a trade - off between topological value and wiring cost .",
    "more specifically , the model accommodates the potentially competitive tendencies of each new neuron to connect to topologically important hub neurons , which may be a long distance away ( @xmath14 mm ) , versus connecting only to neurons that are spatially adjacent ( @xmath15 mm ) , which will conserve wiring cost .",
    "crucially , in estimating the connection cost between pairs of neurons we have used prior data on the birth time of each neuron and the progressive elongation of the worm s body to estimate the distance between each pair of neurons at the time of synapse formation .",
    "this measure of connection cost was traded - off against a topological bias ( preferential attachment ) for new neurons to connect to high degree hub neurons of the adult nervous system .",
    "as the worm s body progressively elongates , the cost penalty predominates and long distance connections , even to hub nodes , become less likely .",
    "this simple but novel model of a dynamically evolving economical trade - off between cost and topology has allowed us to reproduce a phase transition in the growth of the _ c. elegans _ cellular connectome coinciding closely with the moment of hatching , or metamorphic transition from egg to larval stages of development .",
    "dynamical economical growth processes also simulated several aspects of the configuration of the adult nervous system .",
    "the principle that nervous systems conserve wiring cost dates back to the seminal work of ramn y cajal in the 19th century and",
    "it has been experimentally validated and theoretically developed extensively since then . many aspects of brain organization , ranging from the placement of neurons in the adult _ c. elegans _ nervous system @xcite , to the shape of dendritic trees @xcite and the modular architecture of large - scale human brain networks  @xcite , have been plausibly attributed to a parsimonious drive to minimize wiring cost . however",
    ", a strictly cost - minimal network would have a regular , lattice - like topology .",
    "synaptic connections would be clustered between spatially and topologically neighbouring neuronal nodes , with none of the long distance axonal projections needed to mediate topologically efficient communication between widely separated neurons .",
    "but this is not a recognisable description of nervous system topology . in many species , and at many scales of space and time",
    ", it has been found that brain structural and functional networks have shorter average path length or greater efficiency than a regular lattice .",
    "brain networks also consistently have non - regular properties like high - degree hubs in a fat - tailed degree distribution , and a modular community structure entailing long distance inter - modular connections between neurons in anatomically distributed modules .",
    "many of these topological features are more than minimally expensive or incur a premium in wiring cost ; but they can add value to the overall performance of the system .",
    "for example , high - degree hub nodes of the _ c. elegans _ nervous system include many of the so - called command interneurons which play a key role in the adaptive function of coordinated forward and backward movement of the worm @xcite .",
    "topological efficiency of human brain networks has been positively correlated with normal variation in iq ( more intelligent people tend to have more efficient structural and functional networks ) @xcite .",
    "trade - offs between cost and efficiency have been shown to be heritable properties of human brain networks derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri ) data @xcite ; and economical models of network formation can reproduce the ( somewhat different ) statistical properties of fmri networks in both healthy adults and patients with schizophrenia @xcite . these and other observations support the general idea that nervous systems are selected to negotiate an economical trade - off between wiring cost ( usually measured by connection distance ) and topological value ( which could be measured by degree , efficiency or a number of other network properties related to adaptive brain function ) .",
    "so the basic principles of the economical model investigated here are not new to the neuroscience literature  @xcite",
    ". however , there are several distinctive aspects of our results .",
    "firstly , this work is an innovative demonstration that economical models can account for the growth of a nervous system described quite concretely and exactly at the cellular scale of synaptic connections between neurons .",
    "many of the previous studies of economical trade - offs in brain networks have been based on analysis of statistical associations ( so - called functional connectivity ) between fmri time series recorded at different spatial locations @xcite ; or on analysis of large - scale axonal projections rendered by tractography algorithms applied to diffusion imaging data @xcite .",
    "such human neuroimaging results indicate that economical principles may apply to network formation at macroscopic scales , but the neuronal substrate of networks based on imaging statistics remains unresolved .",
    "the demonstration here of economical principles applying to a connectome described with much greater precision at a cellular scale somewhat validates the prior neuroimaging results .",
    "moreover , it suggests that the same competitive selection criteria may inform nervous system formation over multiple spatial scales .",
    "brain networks may have a scale - invariant or fractal economy of organization .    more broadly ,",
    "these results are innovative in demonstrating directly how simple economical growth models can provide a reasonable account of complex growth curves , such as the non - linear processes of nervous system maturation and metamorphosis , from egg to adult worm .",
    "nematodes , like all superphylum ecdysozoa , develop through discrete stages ( egg , several juvenile stages , adult ) separated by moulting events .",
    "the situation in _ c. elegans _ is most closely analogous to hemimetabolous insects ( with `` incomplete metamorphosis '' ) since the juvenile stages resemble the adults apart from the absence of mating / reproductive structures .",
    "however , each moult can be considered metamorphic , with the l1-l2 and l4-adult moults in particular known to involve both the addition of new cells and formation of new synaptic links .",
    "the special significance of the egg - l1 transition has perhaps been less appreciated up to now , and as such represents a unique finding of this work",
    "our more realistic modelling of connection cost , taking into account the changing spatial constraints during the growth of the system , also shines a different light on the many previous studies of connection cost  @xcite in this paradigmatic complex system .",
    "further work will be needed to test the hypothesis that the specific parameters of this model correspond to discrete molecular or genetic signals .",
    "it is imaginable , for example , that a penalty on long distance connections could be biologically coded by the spatial gradient of an axonally attractive molecule diffusing from neurons ; or that neurons destined to have high degree in the adult system express distinctive cell surface markers from birth that favor synaptic formation .",
    "we have compared the performance of the dynamically evolving economical model to that of a number of other models and found , as expected theoretically , that simpler models based on preferential attachment rules could reproduce one or other of the two phases ( quadratic or linear ) of network development pre- or post - hatching . however , only economical models which traded - off connection distance versus preferential attachment bias could reproduce both phases and the timing of phase transition was only accurately reproduced by the dynamic linkage between inter - neuronal connection distance and progressive developmental elongation of the whole organism .",
    "for this reason , we consider that the modelling results affirm our hypothetical prediction that development of this cellular connectome can be accounted for by continual re - negotiation of an economical trade - off between connection cost and the formation of high degree hubs .",
    "this affirmation is conditional on the caveats that not all possible models have been comparatively evaluated .",
    "it is possible that a better model , perhaps incorporating a few more relevant biological details ( such as type of synapse , electrical or chemical ) , could be developed in future .",
    "we note that economical principles of network formation demonstrated here for the growth of the nervous system of the nematode worm are not necessarily limited to this system .",
    "many other systems , besides brains , are both spatially embedded and topologically complex .",
    "we anticipate that economical growth models of the potentially changing trade - offs between physical connection cost and topological value may also contribute to future understanding of the development and evolution of transport , computational and infrastructural systems .",
    "we have used the most up - to - date map of the _ c. elegans _",
    "connectome  @xcite , consisting of @xmath0 somatic neurons interconnected through @xmath16 chemical synapses , @xmath17 gap junctions and @xmath18 neuromuscular junctions .",
    "since gap junctions often overlap with synapses and synaptic connections are often reciprocated , we have considered only the backbone network , where all the synapses and gap junctions between each pair of neurons are represented by a single undirected edge , obtaining a graph with @xmath19 nodes and @xmath20 edges in total ( neuromuscular connections were excluded ) .",
    "information about the growth of the neuronal network , in particular on the exact time of birth of each neuron , has been reconstructed from recent literature  @xcite .",
    "* linear preferential attachment*. the barabsi and albert ( ba ) model assumes that the growth of a network is solely driven by its topological structure , and produces random graphs with a power  law degree distribution @xmath21 , where @xmath22  @xcite . in the model , a new node",
    "is added at each time and is connected to @xmath23 existing nodes .",
    "the probability for the new node @xmath10 to be connected to an existing node @xmath11 is a linear function of the degree @xmath24 , namely : @xmath25 where @xmath6 denotes the total number of links when the new node arrives .",
    "since each node chooses @xmath23 neighbors to connect with , the total number of links increases linearly with the size of the network , and the average node degree remains constant .",
    "* accelerated topological growth*. traditionally , network growth is said to be accelerated if the average node degree increases with the size of the network .",
    "acceleration has been observed in many complex networks and different models of scale - free networks with acceleration have been proposed so far  @xcite .",
    "we have considered two different accelerated growth models . in the first model , called binomial accelerated growth ( bag )",
    ", a new node @xmath10 tries to establish a connection with each of the existing nodes , and a link to node @xmath11 is created with probability @xmath26 , namely : @xmath27 the bag model produces networks in which the number of links increases as the square of @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , the expected number of links established when the network has @xmath5 nodes is : @xmath28 the bag model produces networks with a binomial degree distribution , since it is equivalent to an erds - rnyi random graph model , where each of the @xmath29 potential links appears with probability @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "we introduced also a second model of accelerated growth , called hidden - variable accelerated growth ( hag ) .",
    "in general , hidden - variable models produce networks with a prescribed degree distribution : the hag model grows random networks having  on average  the same degree distribution observed in the adult _ c.  elegans _ neural network .",
    "the model works as follows .",
    "we assign to each node @xmath11 of the network , once and for all , a hidden variable @xmath30 .",
    "in particular , we set @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the degree of node @xmath11 in the adult worm .",
    "when a new node @xmath10 arrives , it tries to establish a link with each of the nodes in the network , and a link to node @xmath11 is created with probability : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the maximum of @xmath30 over @xmath11 , and @xmath26 is appropriately selected in order to reproduce the final number of links .",
    "it is possible to prove that the final degree of a node @xmath10 over different network realizations is poisson distributed around an average value equal to @xmath35 .",
    "consequently , networks produced by hag show an accelerated growth similar to that generated by the bag model , while also preserving the actual degree distribution of the _ c.  elegans _ neural network .",
    "* esg*. to create networks embedded in euclidean space  @xcite , we considered the economical spatial growth model , which is based on a trade - off between the tendency to create topologically important connections to hubs and the physical distance between neurons .",
    "when a new node @xmath10 arrives , it is placed in the position it occupies in the adult worm , and a link to each of the existing nodes is created with probability : @xmath36 where the values @xmath30 are assigned as in the hag model and @xmath37 is a parameter tuning the typical connection distance .",
    "namely , the probability of creating a link exponentially decreases with the euclidean distance @xmath38 that separates @xmath10 and @xmath11 in the adult worm , and is weighted by the hidden variable @xmath31 ( in order to preserve the actual degree distribution of the _ c.  elegans _ neural network ) .",
    "* estg*. the economical spatio - temporal growth model , using information about the length of the worm at different stages , takes into account the actual spatial position of each neuron , while the worm grows over time .",
    "when a new node @xmath10 arrives , it is placed in the position it occupies in the _ c.",
    "elegans _ neural network at time @xmath39 , and a link to each of the existing nodes is created with probability : @xmath40 where the values @xmath30 are assigned as in the hag model , and @xmath37 is a parameter tuning the typical edge length .",
    "notice that the probability to establish a link depends on the time at which node @xmath10 appears , since the distance @xmath41 depends on the relative positions of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which change over time due to elongation of the worm s body .",
    "we considered the real length of the worm at each time , and we estimated the position of each node at that time using linear interpolation and assuming a uniform expansion of the worm along the longitudinal axis .    * parameter tuning*. the first requirement of any suitable model for the _ c. elegans _ neuronal network growth is to produce networks having @xmath19 nodes and , on average , @xmath20 edges , as observed in the adult worm .",
    "we used monte carlo simulations and iterative bisection to identify the interval in the parameter space for which the expected total number of edges @xmath42 of the generated networks was equal to @xmath43 ; see appendix section s3 for methodological details and the optimal parameter values for each of the eight models in appendix table  s - i .",
    "* degree distribution*. given an undirected graph @xmath44 associated with the symmetric adjacency matrix @xmath45 , the degree of a node @xmath10 is defined as the number of edges incident on @xmath10 , and is denoted by @xmath46 .",
    "the degree distribution @xmath47 of the graph indicates , for each value of @xmath48 , the probability of finding a node whose degree is equal to @xmath48 .",

    "the distance distribution @xmath51 is the probability of finding an edge whose distance is exactly equal to @xmath52 .",

    "* section s1 . location of neurons born after hatching *    in fig .",
    "[ fig : s_fig1 ] we show the spatial configuration of neurons before and after hatching . notice that the majority of the neurons born before hatching are concentrated in the head and in the tail region , while most of the neurons appearing after hatching are instead placed in the body to form the ventral cord .",
    "this explains the relative higher distance from newly added neurons to existing ones observed after hatching .",
    "we present here three additional growth models which have been tested during this study , namely the simple spatial growth ( ssg ) , spatial growth with elongation ( sge ) and power - law economical growth ( peg ) .",
    "we also discuss their ability to reproduce the developmental growth of the _ c. elegans _ neuronal network , and we will compare them with the other five models described in the main text , i.e. barabsi - albert ( ba ) , binomial accelerated growth ( bag ) , hidden - variable accelerated growth ( hag ) , economical spatial growth ( esg ) and economical spatio - temporal growth ( estg ) .",
    "notice that all the models considered in this study have only one free parameter .",
    "nevertheless some of these models , and in particular the estg , are exceptionally accurate at reproducing the structure and development of the _ c. elegans _ neuronal network .",
    "_ simple spatial growth ( ssg ) .",
    "_ this model makes the assumption that upon arrival a new node @xmath10 is placed in the same position at which it appears in the adult worm .",
    "then , node @xmath10 creates an edge to each of the already existing nodes @xmath11 with probability : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the distance between node @xmath10 and node @xmath11 in the adult worm and @xmath37 is a parameter tuning the typical edge length . since the connection probability decreases exponentially with the distance between nodes in the adult worm , the resulting networks exhibit very few medium- and high - distance links , which are instead relatively frequent in the real _ c. elegans _ neuronal networks .",

    "notice that @xmath41 is a function of time , so that the probability to create an edge between a newly arrived node @xmath10 and an existing node @xmath11 depends on the time at which node @xmath10 arrives in the network and on the relative positions of @xmath10 and @xmath11 at that time .",
    "this makes possible the creation of edges between nodes which are actually separated by a relatively large distance in the adult worm but have been closer in space in earlier developmental stages .",
    "_ power - law economical growth ( peg ) .",
    "_ this model implements a trade - off between the tendency to create edges to hubs and the relative distance of the nodes , and takes into account the elongation of the worm during development . differently from the economical spatio - temporal growth model presented in the main text ,",
    "in which the connection probability is a decreasing exponential function of distance , in this model the probability to connect to a distant node decreases as a power - law : @xmath59\\ ] ] here , @xmath60 is the hidden degree of node @xmath11 , which is set equal to the degree of node @xmath11 observed in the adult worm , while @xmath34 is maximum node degree in the adult neural network . as for the estg model , @xmath41 is the distance between node @xmath10 and node @xmath11 in the worm at time @xmath39 .",

    "a randomized one - parameter model generates a family of graphs for each value of the parameter , its ability to reproduce the structure of a given network can not be assessed through a direct comparison of the original graph with a single realization of the model . instead",
    ", the comparison should be performed by taking into account the expected structural properties of the ensemble of networks generated by the model , for each value of the parameter , averaging over a sufficiently large number of realizations .",

    "cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      here we compare the structure of the networks produced by each of the eight models described in this study with that observed in the adult _ c. elegans _ neural network , by using three classical network metrics .",
    "the first metric is the degree distribution .",
    "given an undirected graph @xmath44 associated with the symmetric adjacency matrix @xmath45 , the degree of a node @xmath10 is defined as the number of edges incident on @xmath10 , and is denoted by @xmath46 .",
    "the degree distribution @xmath47 of the graph indicates , for each value of @xmath48 , the probability of finding a node whose degree is equal to @xmath48 .",
    "the second metric is the distribution of connection distances .",
    "given two directly connected nodes @xmath10 and @xmath11 of a spatially - embedded network , we define the distance of the edge @xmath49 as the euclidean distance @xmath50 separating node @xmath10 and node @xmath11 .",
    "the associated distance distribution @xmath51 is the probability of finding an edge whose distance is exactly equal to @xmath52 .",
    "the third metric is node efficiency .",
    "given an undirected and unweighted graph @xmath53 , the efficiency of a node is defined as : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the distance between node @xmath10 and node @xmath11 , measured as the number of edges in the shortest path connecting @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "the node efficiency of @xmath10 measures how easy it is to reach any other node in the graph by starting from @xmath10 and traveling across shortest paths . in general , the smaller the distance between @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the higher the contribution of @xmath11 to the efficiency of node @xmath10 .",
    "if the graph is not connected and node @xmath10 and @xmath11 belong to two different connected components then there exists no path connecting them . in this case , the distance @xmath55 is conventionally set to @xmath69 , and the contribution of node @xmath11 to the efficiency of @xmath10 is equal to @xmath70 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : s_fig3 ] ,  [ fig : s_fig4 ] and  [ fig : s_fig5 ] we show , respectively , the average degree distribution , length distribution and node efficiency distribution of the networks generated by each of the eight models , together with those observed in the adult _ c. elegans _ neural network ( reported in each panel in shaded grey ) . by visual inspection , we notice that estg seems to be the model which most closely reproduces all these distributions .    in order to quantify the difference between the distributions of degree , length and node efficiency of synthetic graphs with those of the _ c. elegans _ neural network we used the kullback - leibler divergence .",
    "given two probability distributions @xmath71 and @xmath72 , the kullback - leibler divergence of @xmath73 from @xmath74 is defined as : @xmath75 the kullback - leibler divergence measures the information lost when @xmath73 is used as an approximation of @xmath74 , and is non - symmetric , i.e. @xmath76 . since we are interested in measuring the similarity between two distributions , and not the relative information lost when using one of them as a predictor of the other , we opted for the symmetrized kullback - leibler divergence , which is defined as follows :      in general , the smaller the value of @xmath78 , the more similar the two distributions @xmath74 and @xmath73 . if we denote by @xmath79 the distribution of the generic quantity @xmath80 in the _ c. elegans _ neural network and by @xmath81 the distribution of the same quantity @xmath80 in networks generated through model @xmath82 , the symmetrized kullback - leibler divergence between @xmath79 and @xmath83 is denoted as @xmath84 . in table  [ tab : table3 ] we report , for each model , the values of the symmetrized kullback - leibler divergence between the degree , edge length and node efficiency distributions of the adult _ c. elegans _ neural network and the networks generated by each of the eight models , which are respectively denoted by @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the best and the second - best value of @xmath78 for each metric are highlighted in green and yellow , respectively .",
    "notice that the smallest values of the symmetrized kullback - leibler divergence are consistently obtained by the estg model , with the only exception being node efficiency for which peg outperforms estg by a small amount ."
