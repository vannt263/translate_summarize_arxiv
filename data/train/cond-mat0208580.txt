    "indeed , at higher energies and shorter distances the @xmath2 chain produces features which can not be understood within the framework of ll theory .",
    "these features , absent in @xmath1 chains , stem from the additional degrees of freedom staying massive for @xmath112 .",

    "the operator @xmath114 has large matrix elements between the ground state and the @xmath115 component of this triplet .",
    "this leads to an exponentially decaying alternating ( antiferromagnetic ) behavior in the longitudinal correlation function .",
    "when the magnetic field is switched on , the zeeman energy splits the triplet branch , and at @xmath116 the @xmath117 component at @xmath113 crosses over with the ground state .",
    "however the @xmath115 component remains in the spectrum ( at energy @xmath118 ) and still contributes to the short - range longitudinal correlation functions . as a consequence the two - point function shows a crossover from a seemingly exponential decay on short distances caused by the massive mode to an algebraic decay determined by the soft , ll mode on longer distances .",
    "there is a similar effect in the one - point function we consider here . near the chain s end",
    "there is an exponentially localized effective @xmath1 degree of freedom , the so - called `` end spin '' , which also survives in the magnetized regime , at least when the magnetization is not too high.@xcite its presence produces a crossover from exponential decay to algebraic decay in the one - point correlation function as is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - pb ] . as the magnetization increases the massive modes rise in energy , and have a less and less significant impact on the low - energy physics .",
    "at the same time the end spins gradually dissolve and disappear in the bulk as was observed by yamamoto and miyashita.@xcite     chain with @xmath80 , @xmath81 at the bulk magnetization @xmath119 . only half of the chain shown - the other half is mirror symmetric . the ll oscillation is clearly visible above @xmath120 .",

    "the truncation error varied in the range @xmath122 , the calculation being more precise in the high magnetization regime . a limited number of runs with @xmath123 , @xmath124 was done to check the numerical precision and to obtain results at points where longer systems were needed .",
    "we applied the fitting procedure described above and care was taken to stay in the bulk of the chain sufficiently far from the ends . since for @xmath61 the correlation ( localization ) length of the end spin is about 6 lattice sites , which becomes even shorter for @xmath125 , a chain length @xmath80 was found sufficient .",
    "we observed that the fitting procedure is somewhat less accurate here than for @xmath1 , meaning that finite size corrections to the luttinger liquid profile eq.([profile2 ] ) are more important in for @xmath2 .",
