    "rare b meson decays induced by flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) @xmath2 transition represent an important channel to test the standard model ( sm ) at loop level .",
    "they provide a comprehensive information in the determination of the fundamental parameters , such as cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements , leptonic decay constants , etc . and open a window to investigate the physics beyond the sm , such as two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) , minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) @xcite , etc .",
    "measurement of the branching ratios ( @xmath3 ) of the inclusive @xmath4 @xcite and the exclusive @xmath5 @xcite decays stimulated the study of the rare b meson decays in a new force .",
    "currently , the main interest is focused on the rare decays where the sm predicts large @xmath3 , which is measurable in the near future .",
    "@xmath0 decay is one of the candidate of these decays and it is described by @xmath6 transition at the quark level . in the literature",
    "@xcite- @xcite this transition has been investigated extensively in the sm , 2hdm and mssm .",
    "the forward - backward asymmetry of dileptons is another quantity which provides information on the short distance contributions .",
    "further , the longitudinal lepton polarization includes different combinations of the wilson coefficients @xmath7,@xmath8 and @xmath9 and it can shed light on the investigation of their signs in the sm and new physics beyond .",
    "the theoretical analysis of exclusive decays is more complicated due to the hadronic form factors , which brings sustantial uncertainity in the calculations .",
    "however , it is well known that the experimental investigation of inclusive decays is more difficult compared those of exclusive ones",
    ". therefore we will consider the exclusive @xmath0 in the present work .",
    "the calculation of the physical observables in the hadronic level needs non - perturbative methods to determine the matrix elements of the quark level effective hamiltonian between the hadronic states .",
    "this problem has been studied in the framework of different approaches such as relativistic quark model by the light - front formalism @xcite , chiral theory @xcite , three point qcd sum rules method @xcite , effective heavy quark theory @xcite and light cone qcd sum rules @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we present the next to leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrected effective hamiltonian in the 2hdm with flavor changing neutral currents ( model iii ) for the inclusive decay @xmath10 and calculate the differential @xmath3 of the exclusive @xmath0 decay .",
    "further , we study the forward - backward asymmetry ( @xmath11 ) and the longitudinal lepton polarization ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we give the nlo qcd corrected hamiltonian and corresponding matrix element for the inclusive @xmath13 decay and calculate the matrix element .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the calculation of the differential @xmath3 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 of the exclusive @xmath0 decay . in section 4",
    "we analyse the dependencies of the @xmath3 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 on the the yukawa couplings @xmath14 , @xmath15 and estimate the @xmath16 for the model iii .",
    "in this section we present the nlo qcd corrections to the inclusive @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) decay amplitude in the 2hdm with tree level neutral currents ( model iii ) . before presenting the details of calculations",
    ", we would like to give the essential points of this model .",

    "is defined by the expression @xmath35 note that the charged couplings appear as a linear combinations of neutral couplings multiplied by @xmath36 matrix elements ( more details see @xcite ) .",
    "the next step is the calculation of the qcd corrections to @xmath37 decay amplitude in the model iii .",
    "the appropriate framework is that of an effective theory obtained by integrating out the heavy degrees of freedom . in the present case , @xmath38 quark ,",

    "the qcd corrections are done through matching the full theory with the effective low energy theory at the high scale @xmath43 and evaluating the wilson coefficients from @xmath44 down to the lower scale @xmath45 .",
    "note that we choose the higher scale as @xmath43 since the evaluation from the scale @xmath46 to @xmath43 gives negligible contribution to the wilson coefficients since the charged higgs boson is heavy enough from the current theoretical restrictions , for example @xmath47 @xcite , @xmath48 @xcite .",

    "therefore the determination of the sign of @xmath11 in the region @xmath208 ( here the upper limit corresponds to the value where @xmath11 change sign in the sm ) can give a unique information about the existence of the model iii .",

    "it is interesting to note that the final lepton tends to move almost in the direction of @xmath161 meson with increasing @xmath206 for @xmath204 , especially in the @xmath168 region far from ld effects .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath12 versus @xmath168 is presented in series of figures ( [ plbb403q2a ] and [ plbb403q2b ] ) for @xmath206 and charged higgs mass @xmath202 at the scale @xmath146 .",

    "this tendency increases with increasing @xmath206 .",
    "now we would like to present the values of @xmath3 for the @xmath209 decay in the sm and model iii , without the ld effects .",
    "after integrating over @xmath168 , we get @xmath210 and for the model iii @xmath211 the @xmath3 in the sm is almost equal to the model iii value for @xmath212 .",
    "however , the strong enhancement can be observed for @xmath213 , especially with increasing @xmath206 .",
    "using the cleo data for the inclusive branching ratio @xmath214 @xcite , it is possible to estimate an upper limit for @xmath206 , which is @xmath215 .    in conclusion , we analyse the selected model iii parameters ( @xmath206 , @xmath205 ) dependencies of the differential @xmath3 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 of the decay @xmath0 .",
    "we obtain that the strong enhancement of the differential @xmath3 is possible in the framework of the model iii and observe that @xmath11 and @xmath12 are very sensitive to the model iii parameters ( @xmath206 , @xmath205 ) .",
