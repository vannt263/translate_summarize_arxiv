    "a photoelectron emitted from an atom may be scattered by neighboring atoms .",
    "the scattered waves interfere with the unscattered wave and the intensity pattern at large distances , @xmath0 , forms a hologram which can be analyzed to yield an image of the neighborhood of the electron emitting atom @xcite@xcite .",
    "if the neighboring atoms have spins , then exchange scattering results in the polarization of the outgoing electrons and in addition to the intensity @xmath0 , the polarization pattern @xmath1 also forms a hologram which can be analyzed to yield an image of the spins of the neighboring atoms .",
    "while this scheme of ` spin holography ' is elegant , it suffers from the fact that present day electron polarimeters are very inefficient ( eff .",
    "@xmath3 ) detracting from the practical utility of this way of imaging the spins .",
    "therefeore , the existence of an alternate method to extract the spin information from the intensity hologram @xmath0 , such as the scheme that we discuss in this paper , is of interest .",
    "spin holography is a holography scheme yielding spin information on the near - neighborhood probed by electron holography .",
    "this is in contrast to the long range order and bulk magnetism determinations in magnetic diffraction methods using neutrons or x - rays .",
    "since the effect of exchange interaction on the electron - atom scattering becomes less pronounced as the kinetic energy of the electron increases , it is likely that spin holography will prove to be most useful if the photoelectron has relatively low energy ( @xmath4 100 - 200 ev ) . in this energy range ,",
    "the mean - free path of the electron is of the order of a few nanometers and only atoms within that distance of the photoelectron source atom will contribute significantly to the hologram .",
    "therefore , we expect that electron holographic spin determination will be useful as a probe of surface magnetism , with the source atoms lying within the first few surface layers or as adatoms adhering to the surface . as an example where holographic spin determination is useful",
    ", we can use adatom sources on the surface of a ferromagnet to determine the spins of the first few layers , while the surface information is difficult to obtain from ` diffraction ' measurements .",
    "consider the example of a substrate with the first two layers magnetized , layer @xmath5 having all its atoms with spin @xmath6 and layer @xmath7 having spin @xmath8 . then while the holographic method with the sources , e.g. adatoms on the top surface , would yield a proper image of the neighboring atoms on the two layers , diffraction measurements can only distinguish the actual magnetic surface ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) from the surface with the spins of the layers reversed ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) , by detailed compairison of the diffraction data with numerical multiple scattering calculations .    clearly ,",
    "if the photoelectrons are @xmath13 then the @xmath14 holograms , @xmath0 , are sensitive to the spins of the neighboring scatterers . however , a new and important feature of the ` spherical wave holograms ' is that the photoelectrons need not be polarized for @xmath0 to be used to image the spins of the neighboring atoms : unpolarized electrons suffice if there are spin - orbit correlations . as a consequence ,",
    "if the photoelectrons are ejected from inner core spin - orbit split subshells ( e.g. @xmath15 or @xmath16 ) , @xmath17 , then as we show below , their intensity holograms @xmath0 , can be analyzed to image the spins .",
    "this is an interesting and important new result .",
    "it is important that linearly polarized synchrotron radiation can be used to image the spins .",
    "it is interesting for the same reason ",
    "one is surprised ( at least at first ) that linearly polarized light ejecting electrons from a complete inner atomic subshell gives an intensity pattern with a linear dependence on the spins @xmath18 of the neighboring atoms .",
    "( indeed , the analysis of these matters lead us to interesting new spinor calculus results @xcite ) .",
    "below , we discuss the cases where linearly polarized , circularly polarized and unpolarized light is used to eject the photoelectrons .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we calculate the photoelectron hologram , including the exchange scattering contributions which give a linear dependence on the spins of the atoms in the near - neighborhood of the photoelectron source atom .",
    "often the emitting atoms are centers of point symmetry , e.g. @xmath19 , for the crystalline surfaces being investigated . in those cases , we can use symmetry to aid in spin determination , as we discuss in section iii .",
    "we then proceed in section iv to illustrate the technique for a specific example of a @xmath20 environment . in section",
    "v , we discuss various schemes to extract spin information from the holograms .",
    "finally , in section vi , we comment on the interesting case of rare earth magnetism , for which the theory of spin holography , as formulated below , needs to be generalized .",
    "we conclude and summarize the results in section vii .",
    "initially , to be definite , we consider photoelectrons emitted from a @xmath21 subshell of a source atom following the absorption of photons linearly polarized in the z - direction .",
    "the @xmath21 subshell consists of two electrons with magnetic quantum numbers @xmath22 = @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively .",
    "the primary electron wave emitted from the @xmath22-state is a spherically outgoing wave of wave number k , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the appropriate angular dependent spinor of the primary electron wave . in the reference frame",
    "pictured in fig.(1 ) , these spinors ( in the dipole approximation ) are proportional to @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the usual polar angle and @xmath29 the azimuthal angle of @xmath30 in eq.([e : sp ] ) , and in the following , @xmath31 , where c is the ratio of the radial matrix elements @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) and corresponding phase shifts @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) for emission into the continuum s- or d - states , c = @xmath36 $ ]",
    ".    the primary wave is scattered by an atom i , giving a scattered wave @xmath37 .",

    "if we could treat the scattering atoms as spherically symmetric then @xmath51 and @xmath53 would only depend on @xmath54 .",

    "the charge ( and spin ) distribution within a wigner - seitz cell representing an atom is not spherically symmetric about the cell s center .",

    ", the uncompensated spins are believed to occupy @xmath56 d - orbitals on the copper ions .",

    "in our example of photoemission from a @xmath21 level , the interference matrix elements for photons of arbitrary polarization @xmath62 ( @xmath63 , for z - linearly polarized , @xmath64 for right- and left - hand polarized light etc .... ) are equal to @xmath65    for emission from a filled @xmath66-shell the intensity interference matrix element , @xmath67 , is twice the intensity matrix element of eq.([e : int ] ) , as a consequence of the @xmath66-shell having twice as many electrons .",
    "similarly , the @xmath66 spin interference matrix element , @xmath68 is the negative of the spin interference matrix element shown on the last line of eq.([e : int ] ) @xcite , which follows from the fact that the @xmath66 and @xmath21 spin matrix elements add up to the spin matrix element for photoemission from a p - shell which , in the absence of spin - orbit interaction , vanishes .",
    "it is a feature of spherical wave electron holography that the interference between electron waves emitted in @xmath69 directions is recorded . as a consequence ,",
    "it is not the spin polarization of the electrons emitted in the direction of the scattering atom @xmath42 that gives the holographic spin dependence , but the interference matrix element of the emission directions @xmath30 and @xmath42 , @xmath70 .",
    "the occurrence of these quantities in our theory leads to interesting new aspects of angular momentum theory .    that the spin matrix element is of the form of eq.([e : int ] )",
    "can be understood from general considerations ",
    "the matrix element must be ` bilinear ' in the photon polarization , meaning that each term contains @xmath62 and @xmath71 .",
    "furthermore , the spin matrix element must be a pseudo vector made up of @xmath62 , @xmath71 , @xmath30 , and @xmath42 . in the dipole approximation ,",
    "the wave emitted from a p - shell is an admixture of an s and a d - wave , from which follows that each term contains @xmath30 and @xmath42 twice or not at all .",
    "based on these considerations we can deduce the general form of the individual terms that make up the @xmath21 ( or @xmath66 ) spin matrix element .",
    "some remarkable results follow from eq.([e : int ] ) .",
    "for example , the spin interference matrix element for z - linearly polarized light does not vanish : @xmath72 implying that linearly polarized photons give spin dependent photoelectron intensities .",
    "the expected spin of the directly emitted photoelectrons in the @xmath73-direction is proportional to @xmath74 , which can be obtained from eq.([e : spinlin ] ) , putting @xmath75 .",
    "this gives an electron spin polarization that is proportional to @xmath76 where we replaced the imaginary part of the @xmath77-parameter by its expression in terms of the phase shifts and the radial dipole matrix elements .",
    "the result of eq.([e : spind ] ) makes it clear that the resulting spin polarization is in fact caused by the interference of the outgoing s and d - waves , as was pointed out previously @xcite . nevertheless , even if the spin polarization ( [ e : spind ] ) of the unscattered photoelectrons vanish , because , for example , the electron is emitted as a pure d - wave , the interference spin matrix element does @xmath78 vanish .",
    "the pure d - wave photoemission corresponds to @xmath79 giving @xmath80    thus the d - wave photoelectron incident upon and scattered from the scattering atom is not spin polarized , ( i.e. @xmath81 ) , nor is the unscattered wave emitted in the @xmath30-direction polarized , ( i.e. @xmath82 ) ; but the interference between the photoelectron waves emitted in the @xmath83-direction and scattered into the direction @xmath30 with the waves emitted directly in that direction does result in a polarization and gives a photoelectron intensity sensitive to the spin of the scattering atom .",
    "another interesting consequence of this angular correlation in the photoelectron spin is that the interference of the directly emitted and scattered electron waves gives a finite spin polarization to the photoelectrons , even though the directly emitted electrons are spin unpolarized and the scattering atom is not magnetic .",
    "perhaps even more surprising than the fact that incident linearly polarized light gives rise to spin - sensitive holograms is that so does unpolarized light .",
    "note that unpolarized light incident along the z - direction , say , on the source atom gives photoelectron intensities equal to the sum of those for x- and y - linearly polarized beams .",
    "now the sum of x-,y- and z - polarized beams gives @xmath84 thus , @xmath85 and substituting from eq.([e : spinlin ] ) we see that unpolarized light also gives a non - vanishing spin contribution to the photoelectron intensity and thus can serve to photoemit electrons with an intensity hologram that is sensitive to the spins of the nearby atoms .",
    "these surprising results are caused by the spin - orbit correlation in the initial shell , which is preserved in the emitted d - waves .",
    "the remarkable consequences clearly indicate that the interference matrix elements contain novel and interesting physics .    returning to the intensity hologram of eq.([e : i2 ] ) , it is clear from the subsequent discussion of the interference matrix elements that the spin contributions to the intensity hologram do nt vanish if the electrons are emitted from an atomic spin - orbit split shell .",
    "the spin contributions are , however , relatively small , only making an addition of the order of @xmath86 ( @xmath87 , e.g. , for electron scattering by an iron atom at 100 ev ) to the ordinary , spin independent ` charge ' hologram . _",
    "the challenge then is to extract the spin information from the hologram_.",
    "the question becomes how to isolate the spin dependent part of the hologram from the much larger ` charge ' part background .    referring back to eq.([e : i2 ] ) , if we were able to reverse all the @xmath18 s of the sample then the difference hologram would contain only the spin dependent terms . reversing the sample s spins , however , would be feasible only for ferro- or ferrimagnetic samples .",
    "alternatively , the difference of holograms below and above the magnetic ordering temperatures can serve to determine the spins in the cases where we can assume that the change of the spin independent factors in eq.([e : i2 ] ) is small .",
    "other than those two methods depending on changing the magnetization of the sample by changing the magnetic field or the temperature , which may not be feasible , there are other methods which can serve our purposes :    if the primary wave , ( [ e : sp ] ) , had only an s - wave component rather than the d - s mixture , then only the @xmath88 terms in eq.([e : int ] ) would be present . in that case @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and",
    "the difference holograms for incident right and left - hand circularly polarized light around , successively x , y and z - axes would determine all three components of the spin vectors .",
    "in fact , however , the s - wave component is almost an order of magnitude smaller than the dominant d - wave contribution in the case of photoemission from a p - shell at the relevant emission energies ( @xmath91 ev ) .",
    "furthermore , we note that the extraction of the spin terms from right - left polarization differences contain spin independent ` charge ' contributions . indeed , with eq.([e : int ] ) we find @xmath92 \\ ; \\ ; , \\label{e : intpm}\\ ] ] and referring back to eq.([e : i2 ] ) , we see that the difference hologram does indeed contain ` charge ' contributions .    we can , however , use @xmath93 to aid in spin determination",
    ". often the emitting atoms are centers of point symmetry , e.g. @xmath19 , for the crystalline surfaces being investigated .",
    "any differences detected after subjecting the hologram to a point symmetry group operation is then the result of the symmetry breaking spin contributions .",
    "based on this general idea , we work out practical schemes to construct ` spin holograms ' . for the sake of simplicity , we start by illustrating the main idea for the case of reflection symmetry in subsection [ 3a ] . in subsection",
    "[ 3b ] , we approach the problem from a more general perspective .",
    "let @xmath94 represent the photoelectron intensity emitted in the @xmath30-direction , for photon polarization @xmath62 , matter state m , and let @xmath95 be the corresponding quantities following a spatial reflection .",
    "since the hamiltonian is invariant under reflections , @xmath96 also , @xmath97 since the square of the reflection is the unit operator .",
    "now ` m ' represents the initial state of the source atom , centered at the origin , and the various neighboring atoms centered at @xmath83 , with spins @xmath18 , and other properties , including valence electron spatial distributions , @xmath98 : m = @xmath99 $ ] , m = @xmath100 $ ] . since @xmath101 is an axial vector , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , where the @xmath104 and @xmath105 subscripts refer to components respectively parallel and perpendicular to the plane of reflection .",
    "if the source atom is in a site with @xmath19 point symmetry , magnetic ordering of the neighboring atoms may break that symmetry , and the difference hologram , @xmath106 \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{2 } \\ ; \\left [ i(\\hat{\\bf r},\\hat{\\epsilon};m ) - i({\\bf r},\\hat{\\epsilon};m ' ) \\right ] \\ ; \\ ; , \\label{e : iv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] contains only the symmetry breaking spin terms if the reflection plane , v , is a symmetry plane .",
    "this is so because if atom ` j ' is carried into atom ` k ' by the reflection then @xmath107 , by symmetry , and the non - spin dependent part of the hologram , the ` charge ' hologram is unchanged by the reflection .",
    "if atom ` i ' lies in the reflection plane then @xmath108,@xmath109,@xmath110 , @xmath111 , and the contribution of ` i ' to the difference hologram @xmath112 is ( see eq.([e : i2 ] ) ) @xmath113 \\ ; f_{s}({\\bf r},{\\bf r}_{i } ) \\langle \\langle \\hat{\\bf r } | \\sigma    \\exp(-ik\\hat{\\bf r}\\cdot { \\bf r}_{i } ) \\ } \\ ; \\ ; . \\label{e : iv2}\\ ] ]    on the other hand , if atom ` j ' does not lie in the reflection plane ` v ' and is carried into atom ` k ' by the reflection then @xmath114 = @xmath115 , and the contribution of site ` k ' to @xmath112 becomes @xmath116 \\ ; f_{s}({\\bf r},{\\bf r}_{k } ) \\langle \\langle \\hat{\\bf r } | \\sigma    + { \\bf s}_{j,//}-{\\bf s}_{j,\\perp } ) \\ ; \\exp(-ik\\hat{\\bf r}\\cdot { \\bf r}_{k } ) \\ } \\ ; \\ ; . \\label{e : iv3}\\ ] ] the hologram @xmath112 given by summing the in - plane , eq.([e : iv2 ] ) , and out of plane , eq.([e : iv3 ] ) , terms can then be transformed , as we shall discuss later , to determine components of the spins of the various atoms .",
    "the above considerations regarding reflections illustrate the use of symmetry to obtain spin holograms .",
    "if g is an element , a reflection or a rotation , of a point symmetry group which leaves the charge or chemical neighborhood invariant , then the difference hologram involving g has only the symmetry breaking spin contributions .",
    "the argument is essentially that given above .",
    "for example , the difference between the emission intensity @xmath94 measured in direction @xmath30 with incident photons of polarization @xmath62 and the intensity measured in direction @xmath117 $ ] with photons of polarization @xmath118 $ ] , @xmath119,g[\\hat{\\epsilon}];m)$ ] contains only spin contributions because the charge contributions cancel .    to see that",
    ", we note that the hamiltonian is invariant under all of the transformations of the euclidean group ( except for the small parity non - conserving terms which are irrelevant for our considerations ) .",

    "one can devise an iterative scheme to determine @xmath53 and the spins : use the calculated @xmath53 to estimate the atomic spin vectors .",

    "the question now arises , are there good reasons to measure and analyze ` spin holograms ' of rare earth ions , given their evident complexity ?",
    "we think there is because of the relation of such scattering measurements to the rkky mechanism responsible for the rare earth ion interactions in solids .",

    "the role of the anisotropic , higher moment terms , eq.(40 ) , in @xmath254 on the rkky - interaction have not been investigated as thoroughly as their importance warrants .",
    "frederick specht @xcite in an early investigation retained only terms up to @xmath288 and found quite large effects .",
    "thus for two nearest neighbor @xmath289 ions whose moments were aligned along the inter - ionic direction he obtained @xmath290 , while if the moments are perpendicular to that direction he obtained @xmath291 , a @xmath292 variation ; while for tm ions the numbers were @xmath293 , a @xmath294 variation .",
    "( note that for the cigar shaped spin distribution of tb @xmath295 , while the opposite held for the pancake shaped tm spin distributions ) .",
    "we think that spin holographic experiments on a ferromagnetic surface layer of terbium , for example , as a function of temperature , magnetic field , and @xmath127 of the photoelectron , revealing the effects of the moments of various orders , would be very interesting .    an interesting question is what measurement must be made to determine the quantum state of a system @xcite . consider a system with angular momentum @xmath296 . in general its state",
    "is determined by its density matrix @xmath297 .",
    "what measurements can be made to determine the @xmath298 real numbers required to specify @xmath299 ?",
    "in reference @xcite we outlined one method using ` feynman filters ' ; but we also mentioned that fano @xcite had shown that measurement of the @xmath300 expected multipole moments @xmath301 also would suffice . in our work here we have seen that the @xmath281 s could be determined ( in principle ) for @xmath302 , or @xmath303 by means of coherent electron scattering , the higher order multipoles vanish .",
    "thus for gd only the first order moment , @xmath304 could be so determined , while for the other rare earths much more state information can be determined , but not enough to fully determine the state .",
    "the main message of this paper is that we can construct holograms of the atomic spins in the near - neighborhood of a photoelectron emitting atom from the angularly resolved photoelectron emission intensities . for the important case of photoelectrons emitted by source atoms with @xmath19-environment",
    ", we show how these spin holograms can be constructed using symmetry .",
    "furthermore , we discuss schemes to holographically image the spins and to extract accurate spin information from the spin holograms .    the photons used to emit the electrons that give the intensity holograms for the purpose of spin holography can be , @xmath305 , circularly polarized .",
    "incident linearly polarized , or indeed even @xmath306 light would also serve the purpose .",
    "this statement could appear somewhat puzzling because it seems to imply that it is unnecessary to polarize the primary photoelectron waves in order to probe the spins of the nearby scattering atoms .",
    "we show that the surprising ability of unpolarized light to record spin information in the photoelectron intensity is a consequence of the spin - orbit correlations in the initial inner - core electron states from which the photoelectron is emitted .",
    "the spin - orbit correlations give a finite interference contribution to the spin of electrons emitted in different directions .",
    "it is the interference of the photoelectron emitted in the @xmath30-direction , and that emitted in the direction of atom i and then scattered into the @xmath30-direction , that gives the holographic fringes in the photoelectron intensity . by virtue of exchange scattering the holographic fringes are then sensitive to the spin of the scattering atom , with contributions proportional to the scalar product of the atomic spin and the interference contribution to the photoelectron spin , @xmath307 .",
    "note that it is not , as one might have surmised , the spin of the photoelectron wave emitted in the @xmath83-direction , @xmath308 , that is of importance .",
    "indeed , under some conditions , this primary wave spin polarization can vanish , implying unpolarized electrons impinging on the scattering atom , while @xmath309 , implying a spin dependent photoelectron intensity hologram . in the paper , we calculate the spin intereference matrix element for photoemission from a @xmath21 shell , by absorbing photons of arbitrary polarization .    furthermore , to obtain an actual spin hologram from the photoelectron intensity ,",
    "it is necessary to ` separate out ' the spin dependent holographic fringes , which typically contribute 5 @xmath310 or less , from the rest of the hologram . in this paper , we point out how this separation can be obtained using symmetry if the source atom is in a site of @xmath19-symmetry . specifically , we show that a group theoretical projection of the emission intensity onto the irreducible ( @xmath250)-representation gives a hologram of the projection of the spin arrangement of the nearby atoms onto the ( @xmath250)-spin mode .",
    "this way , one can obtain almost all components of the spin vectors ( all but one for the n - atom star and all but three for the 2n - atom star , as explained in the text ) .",
    "the advantage of measuring emission intensities , rather than having to spin analyze the emitted electrons , is considerable : one does not lose the usual factor of @xmath311 in intensity due to the low efficiency of the electron polarimeters .",
    "consequently , we expect that the proposed experiments are quite feasible at a synchrotron source and it is possible that the data have already been obtained and only need to be analyzed .    to conclude , we repeat that spin holography is a surface probe which probes the average short - range magnetic environment of the photoelectron source atom . by using atoms adsorbed on a surface as sources ,",
    "spin holography can reveal the influence of these adsorbates on the spins of the neighboring substrate atoms .",
    "it can then provide detailed information on many interesting systems , such as adsorbed oxygen atoms quenching the magnetism of a nickel surface , or iron atoms inducing moments on neighboring palladium substrate atoms ( superparamagnetism ) .",
    "alternatively , substrate atoms can be used as sources to image the spins of objects adsorbed on the surface , such as small molecules .",
    "finally , spin holography should be useful for surface studies of magnetic systems with large and complicated unit cells of n spins , such as garnets .",
    "( spin holography gives information about the n spins as a function of the n positions , whereas the usual diffraction techniques give the @xmath312 spin - spin correlation as functions of the @xmath312 relative positions ) .",

    "<S> earlier @xcite@xcite , we pointed out that the polarization pattern @xmath1 similarly can be viewed as a hologram of the spin environment of the source atom by virtue of the exchange scattering of the photoelectron by the neighboring atoms . in this paper , we point out that spin - orbit correlations in the photoelectron initial state are responsible for holographic spin - dependent contributions to the intensity hologram @xmath0 , even if the directly emitted photoelectrons are unpolarized . </S>",
    "<S> this remarkable result implies that the emission intensity contains spin information just as the polarization pattern @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> although the spin dependent signal in the hologram is rather small ( @xmath2 in most cases of interest ) , we show how spin information can be extracted from the intensity hologram , making use of the point symmetry of the environment of the source atom . this way of analyzing photoelectron intensity holograms to extract short - range spin information opens up a new avenue for surface magnetism studies . </S>"
