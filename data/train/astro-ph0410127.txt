    "common at intermediate and high redshifts , yet rare in the local universe , luminous compact blue galaxies ( lcbgs ) typically have luminosities equal to or greater than that of the milky way but are considerably smaller in size @xcite . as evidenced by such properties",
    ", they are among the most extreme galaxies known in the universe .",
    "although these galaxies have been the subject of numerous comprehensive studies in the past decade , their evolution and nature , to a large extent , remains in dispute @xcite . at the heart of the issue",
    "lies the difficulty of identifying nearby analogues that would allow a more complete exploration of the mechanisms responsible for their extreme properties at high redshifts , as well as their evolutionary paths .    characterized by high surface brightnesses , small half - light radii , and vigorous star - formation , lcbgs were initially identified as stellar objects from 4-m plate surveys for qso candidates @xcite .",
    "the formal definition of lcbgs is developed by @xcite from examining regions of six - dimensional parameter space ( color , luminosity , asymmetry , concentration , size , and surface brightness ) occupied by three classes of compact galaxies chosen to represent the population of luminous , blue , compact galaxies as a whole .",
    "the three classes are : ( 1 ) compact narrow emission - line galaxies ( cnelgs , koo _ etal . _  1994 , 1995 ; guzmn 1996 , 1998 ) , ( 2 )",
    "a subset of galaxies very similar to cnelgs studied by @xcite and @xcite called faint blue galaxies , and ( 3 ) higher redshift blue nucleated galaxies ( bngs , schade _ etal .",
    "_  1995 , 1996 ) .",
    "while the classification of an lcbg relies on the galaxy s falling within three of five defined regions in the aforementioned parameter space , recently groups have adopted three cut - offs that roughly correspond to the criteria laid out by @xcite : @xmath14 , @xmath15 mag arcsec@xmath2 , and @xmath16 , with @xmath17 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "these selection criteria will be further examined in subsequent sections .    with a volume density that drops off substantially from @xmath18 to",
    "the present ( previously estimated to be a change of roughly a factor of ten ) , lcbgs appear to be the most strongly evolving galaxy population @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimate that they contribute nearly @xmath19 of the fractional increase in the sfr density between @xmath20 and @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , luminous , compact star - forming galaxies appear to dominate high - redshift galaxy samples .",
    "@xcite have suggested that the lyman break galaxies at @xmath21 , due to their very compact cores and high surface brightnesses , may be the high - redshift counterparts of the intermediate - z lcbgs .",
    "@xcite , in a sub - millimeter galaxy survey , found a @xmath22 galaxy population that may contribute a substantial fraction of the sfr density in the early universe , nearly half of which are very luminous and compact . evidently , lcbgs play a prominent , if not paramount , role in the formation and evolution of galaxies in the young universe .",
    "a drove of unanswered questions hovers around the subject of lcbgs , mainly owing to the lack of a representative local sample .",
    "one of these questions involves the mechanism(s ) responsible for the observed intense starbursts in lcbgs . in theory , these triggering mechanisms could be determined by examining the h@xmath7 velocity fields and morphologies of local lcbg examples @xcite .",
    "this sort of study relies on the assumption that one can select a sample of local lcbgs to have the same properties as the more distant lcbgs .",
    "@xcite use a sample of six galaxies with @xmath23 between -17.5 and -20 selected from local blue compact galaxies ( bcgs ) that are bright in h@xmath7 to infer certain kinematic properties of the higher-@xmath8 lcbgs .",
    "they conclude that , in most cases , mergers or strong interactions trigger the intense starbursts of lcbgs .",
    "however , one should use caution in interpreting these results given the size and properties of their sample . indeed",
    ", a statistically complete sample of low - z lcbgs will provide more clues as to the the origin of their activity .",
    "another crucial topic in the study of lcbgs has been the question of what sort(s ) of galaxy they become as they evolve .",
    "the determination of reliable mass estimates for the intermediate-@xmath8 lcbgs is key to establishing these evolutionary connections to present - day galaxies .",
    "however , accurate stellar mass estimates are difficult to determine and measurements of emission - line widths used to indicate the virial mass may underrepresent the gravitational potential for the intermediate - redshift lcbgs @xcite . as a consequence of these difficulties ,",
    "there is not good agreement for the mass estimates of lcbgs and there is a corresponding uncertainty as to their proposed evolutionary path(s ) .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite argue for an evolutionary scenario in which lcbgs represent the formation of the bulges of objects that will eventually evolve into massive spiral disks of today .",
    "etal . _  ( 1995 ) , and guzmn _ etal .",
    "_  ( 1996 , 1997 , 1998 ) maintain that while lcbgs represent a heterogeneous class of galaxies , the majority will evolve into local low - mass dwarf elliptical galaxies .",
    "a possible solution to the mass debate may lie in the hi line widths of local lcbgs .",
    "these line widths can be used to infer the total dynamical mass .",
    "accordingly , @xcite set out to measure the hi line widths of a nearby sample of galaxies they believe are representative of the more distant lcbgs .",
    "they infer the masses of the intermediate-@xmath8 galaxies from these local examples , and find that lcbgs have a variety of dynamical masses , and thus a variety of evolutionary paths . yet",
    ", they recognize that their local sample may not have been truly representative of the the high-@xmath8 lcbg population . of their 11 local galaxies , only three meet the criteria proposed by @xcite . in a study of 20 local lcbg candidates selected to more",
    "nearly meet the the criteria of @xcite , @xcite found results similar to those of @xcite .",
    "specifically , they show that while most lcbgs are nearly ten times less massive than local galaxies of the same luminosity , some are just as massive .",
    "the implication is that lcbgs are a heterogeneous class of galaxy .",
    "clearly , defining reliable local samples of lcbgs is central to the process of understanding their nature and evolutionary paths .",
    "the @xcite and @xcite samples are recent attempts to construct samples of nearby lcbgs .",
    "the latter study is based on a sample of lcbgs discovered by @xcite who analyzed data from the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "another recent study by @xcite utilized the complete spectroscopic study of a 12 deg@xmath24 area centered on the fornax cluster to identify a sample of 13 lcbgs with redshifts less than 0.21 . in the current study",
    ", we take a slightly different approach .    using the kpno international spectroscopic survey ( kiss , salzer _ etal .",
    "_  2000 ) , we aim to identify and describe a statistically complete local sample of star - forming galaxies that best resemble those lcbgs observed in the more distant universe .",
    "our low - z sample will provide a basis for future work aimed at resolving the debates over the evolutionary histories and kinematics of lcbgs . due to the limited resolution of the survey images ,",
    "the classification scheme developed by @xcite , that uses morphological parameters , can not be employed .",
    "instead , we apply selection criteria consistent with the parameters of @xcite as a way to isolate the lcbgs from other kiss star - forming galaxies .",
    "while sharp boundaries in parameter space do not always effectively isolate one type of galaxy from another , lcbgs in the color - surface brightness plane occupy a well - defined region of parameter - space @xcite .",
    "therefore , we employ criteria in _ _ b__@xmath25_v _ color , in surface - brightness , and in luminosity to select a sample of local lcbg candidates .",
    "still , none of the selection criteria we use can guarantee that the kiss lcbg candidates , like other putative local samples , will contain _ bona fide _ lcbgs ; they only insure a similarity .",
    "regardless , we believe that the sample we define will provide an adequate starting point for future investigation . in @xmath26 2 , we describe kiss , our measurements , and selection criteria .",
    "an analysis of the properties of our local lcbgs along with the volume density calculation appears in @xmath26 3 .",
    "section 4 contains a discussion of the implications our sample has for high-@xmath8 studies and potential future work on these galaxies beyond kiss . in @xmath26 5 ,",
    "we summarize our results . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt @xmath4 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 .",
    "the kpno international spectroscopic survey ( kiss ) aims to find a quantifiably complete , well - defined sample of extragalactic emission - line sources @xcite .",
    "although this survey is not the first to look for galaxies that display unusual activity , it reaches substantially deeper than other wide - field objective - prism surveys , mainly because it @xmath27 the first survey of this type to employ a large - format ccd as its detector .",
    "the survey data , composed of both objective - prism and direct images , were taken with the 0.61 m burrell schmidt telescope located on kitt peak .",
    "the objective - prism images cover a spectral range of either 4800 - 5500   or 6400 - 7200  and the direct images are observed through standard _",
    "b _ and _ v _ filters .",
    "our local sample of lcbgs is derived from the first three kiss survey strips : kiss red list 1 ( kr1 ) , described in @xcite ; kiss blue list 1 ( kb1 ) , described in @xcite ; and kiss red list 2 ( kr2 ) , described in @xcite .",
    "kr1 and kr2 use the h@xmath7 line for selection whereas kb1 detects objects by their [ oiii ] emission line .",
    "the kr1 portion of kiss finds 1128 elg candidates in a survey area of 62.2 deg@xmath24 ( or 18.1 kiss elgs per square degree ) ; the kb1 portion of kiss finds 223 elg candidates in 116.6 deg@xmath24 ( or 1.91 kiss elgs per square degree ) ; and the kr2 portion of kiss finds 1029 elg candidates in 65.8 deg@xmath24 ( or 15.6 kiss elgs per square degree ) .",
    "kr1 and kb1 overlap with part of the century survey ( geller _ etal .",
    "_  1997 ; wegner _ etal . _  2001 ) while kr2 runs through the center of the botes void .",
    "the kiss data are run through several steps of processing using a series of image reduction and analysis facility(iraf ) scripts : object detection and inventory , photometry and object classification , astrometry , spectral image coordinate mapping and background subtraction , spectral extraction and overlap correction , emission line detection , and spectral parameter measurement .",
    "measurements of the extracted objective - prism spectra yield estimates of the redshifts , line fluxes , and equivalent widths of the elgs . for a complete description of the data processing ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that many objects are unresolved in the direct images ( which have a resolution of @xmath28 ) ; it is not necessary for an object to be classified morphologically as a galaxy for inclusion in the elg list .",
    "the only criterion for inclusion is the presence of an emission line in the objective - prism spectrum . in other words",
    ", there is no bias against compact , stellar appearing objects in kiss .",
    "although the survey data themselves provide considerable information about the sources , obtaining follow - up spectra is an important part of the kiss project .",
    "these spectra provide higher quality redshifts , confirm elg candidates status as actual elgs , and provide the means by which to identify the type of activity powering the elg . in most cases , emission lines such as h@xmath7 , h@xmath29 , [ o iii ] @xmath304959,5007 , and [ n ii ]",
    "@xmath306548,6583 are present in the follow - up spectra . with the higher - accuracy line strengths of these spectra",
    ", one can distinguish between star - forming galaxies , seyfert 1 galaxies , seyfert 2 galaxies , liners , and qsos .",
    "furthermore , determination of the metallicity @xcite and the star - formation rate is possible with accurate line - strength measurements .",
    "follow - up spectra have been obtained for 83% of the kr1 elgs , 100% of the kb1 elgs , and 30% of the newer kr2 elgs at various telescopes including the hobby - eberly telescope @xcite , the michigan - dartmouth - mit 2.4 m telescope @xcite , the wisconsin - indiana - yale - noao 3.5 m , the 2.1 m on kitt peak , the apache point observatory 3.5 m , and the shane 3.0 m telescope at lick observatory @xcite .",
    "lcbgs typically are identified by their small half - light radii ( @xmath31 ) and/or their high surface brightnesses ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "therefore , measuring these quantities in the kiss data was an essential first step in our effort to isolate a sample of nearby lcbgs .",
    "we wrote an iraf procedure called kcompact to find @xmath31 for every object in the kiss survey images .",
    "the procedure performs a curve of growth analysis using circular apertures to determine @xmath31 .",
    "the formal uncertainty in @xmath31 is estimated by comparing the separate measurements of elgs present in two survey fields ( the overlap in adjacent kiss fields is approximately 3 - 5 arcminutes ) .",
    "based on 14 objects , we determine the uncertainty in @xmath31 to be 0.21 arcseconds . combining our estimates of @xmath31 with the total apparent magnitude measured during the kiss data processing ( see @xmath26 [ kiss_sum ] ) allows us to compute @xmath0 using the following formula : @xmath32 as the formal errors in the kiss apparent magnitudes are always below 0.1 magnitude , we can find the upper limit on the uncertainty of @xmath0 due to the errors in @xmath33 and @xmath31 .",
    "we find @xmath34@xmath35 @xmath11 0.14 mag arcsec@xmath2 .",
    "the reliability of @xmath31 and @xmath0 is inextricably linked to the resolution of the image on which they are measured .",
    "both the image scale and the effective seeing significantly affect the accuracy of these quantities .",
    "resolution limits restrict the precision with which these quantities can be determined in the more distant portion of kiss .",
    "since _ all _ objects in each survey image are analyzed by kcompact , we use the locus of the @xmath31 values for objects previously identified as stars to define a rough resolution limit for each image .",
    "marked interactively , the resolution limit represents not the mean fwhm of the stellar distribution but rather is selected to encompass the entire locus of stellar objects . as we will discuss in the following paragraph , variable image quality across our survey images causes this limit to underestimate the true image quality for a modest fraction of our elg candidates . for kb1 and kr1 , the mean resolution limit ( i.e. , the lower limit on @xmath31 ) of the images is 2.50  compared to an image scale of 2.03/pixel ; for kr2 ,",
    "this mean resolution limit of the images is 2.13  compared to an image scale of 1.43/pixel .",
    "therefore , objects with @xmath31 under @xmath36 are almost always unresolved ( or , at best , marginally resolved ) in the kiss survey direct images . moreover , as the distance to an object increases , so does the physical diameter that corresponds to this resolution limit . that is to say , at greater distances , galaxies with progressively larger diameters dominate any resolved sample .",
    "figure [ fig : distsel ] shows this effect , plotting diameter in kpc vs. distance in mpc , where the diagonal lines represent the nearly constant resolution limits ( converted to kiloparsecs ) below which an object is unresolved .",
    "everything but galaxies with large diameters will be unresolved at the redshift limit of the survey .",
    "ultimately , this bias leads us to adopt a distance - limited sample of kiss lcbgs ( see section 2.3 ) .",
    "= 6.0 in -0.2 in    the rough resolution limit discussed in the previous paragraph suffices for a determination of an appropriate distance - cut ( see below ) , but fails to account for the rather extreme image quality variability of the kiss direct images .",
    "the delivered image quality of the burrell - schmidt 0.61-m at the time kiss was carried out could vary between @xmath36 and @xmath37 over a single survey field .",
    "hence , rather than use a single value to describe the image quality on a given survey image , it is necessary to estimate the local value for the image quality in the vicinity of each kiss elg .",
    "an iraf script was written for this purpose . by locating the ten closest stars to each elg and measuring the fwhm of their profiles ,",
    "this script accounts for the variable image quality of the kiss direct images .",
    "the local fwhm ( average seeing ) for each kiss elg is the mean of the fwhm from the ten stellar profiles . as our study relies upon accurate measurements of @xmath31 and @xmath0 ,",
    "we were forced to exclude those objects for which the local image quality was severely degraded .",
    "a ratio between the mean local fwhm and the half - light diameter acted as our main diagnostic : if the ratio were above 1 , we could not trust the measurement of @xmath31 , and therefore we exclude the galaxy .",
    "in addition , all objects with the local stellar fwhm above 5  and a diagnostic ratio above 0.7 were also excluded . in total 96 galaxies",
    "were cut out of the survey area , decreasing the area over which we could search for lcbgs by only @xmath38 . with these exclusions ,",
    "we feel confident in the completeness of our sample .",
    "that is , in the remaining portions of kiss we should not miss any apparently small , potential lcbg candidate simply because it is under - resolved .",
    "of course , the galaxies remaining in our sample of kiss elgs are not all well - resolved , but as we will describe , we can account for the inaccuracies in their measurements .",
    "= 5.0 in -0.2 in    in essence , our measurements of marginally resolved galaxies act as upper limits on @xmath31 and lower limits on @xmath0 .",
    "we explore the nature of our unresolved and marginally resolved lcbg candidates using higher - resolution images from the wisconsin indiana yale noao ( wiyn ) @xmath39 m telescope on kitt peak . in may 2003 and march 2004",
    "we observed 11 kiss elgs from kr1 and 12 kiss elgs from kr2 under non - photometric conditions with the s2 kb ccd , for which the image scale is 0.6 arcsec / pixel .",
    "the pre - existing kiss direct images for the galaxies , that were taken under good conditions , provided the photometric calibration for our 0.9-m images . despite the different image scales of kr1 and kr2 , we treat them the same in the following analysis due to the variable image quality described above .    for the kiss compact , star - forming elgs in each survey strip ,",
    "we re - measured the half - light radii on the 0.9-m images using the same curve - of - growth routine described above , and compared them with the values of @xmath31 obtained in the same way for the kiss images . the kiss @xmath31 is plotted against the ratio of the 0.9-m @xmath31 to the kiss @xmath31 in figure [ fig : hlradcorr]a to show the results of these re - measurements .",
    "the triangles represent the elgs from kr2 , while the circles represent the elgs from kr1 .",
    "the relationship is equivalent for both strips : those objects with larger @xmath31 have a ratio close to unity , while those objects with @xmath31 near our resolution limits have ratios that deviate more considerably from unity .",
    "we sought to quantify the correlation seen in figure [ fig : hlradcorr]a in order to develop a correction of @xmath31 for all unresolved and marginally resolved elgs in the kiss database .",
    "analyzing our sets of measurements for the 0.9-m images and the kiss images , we can predict the way in that the difference between a galaxy s 0.9-m @xmath31 and its kiss @xmath31 ( @xmath40@xmath31 ) increases as its @xmath31 decreases below the resolution limits of kiss . instead of re - observing all unresolved and marginally resolved kiss elgs to achieve more accurate measurements of their @xmath31",
    ", we can infer the values we would obtain .",
    "two of the eleven kr1 and two of the twelve kr2 elgs observed with the wiyn telescope had @xmath31 greater than 6.0 arcseconds , and were thus very well - resolved in the kiss direct images .",
    "figure [ fig : hlradcorr]a reassures us that our measurements of @xmath31 on the 0.9-m images are very close to our measurements on the kiss images for these four well - resolved galaxies .",
    "these four galaxies were excluded from the determination of our correction . upon closer examination of the 0.9-m images , one galaxy in kr1",
    "was observed to have a merging partner , making suspect any measurement of its @xmath31 .",
    "an additional two galaxies from each survey strip were excluded as well because they suffered from noticeably poorer image quality in the kiss direct images , skewing the relationships shown in the following plots .",
    "figure [ fig : hlradcorr]b shows @xmath40@xmath31 versus the kiss @xmath31 for the 14 remaining galaxies . in this figure , we notice the same effect as in figure [ fig : hlradcorr]a : apparently smaller galaxies have greater @xmath40@xmath31 .",
    "we based the final correction for @xmath31 upon the linear - least squares fit of the 14 data points plotted in figure [ fig : hlradcorr]b .",
    "the fit is shown by the dashed line .",
    "the equation for this line is : @xmath40@xmath31 @xmath41 0.22(kiss @xmath31 ) @xmath25 1.19 , where @xmath40@xmath31 is in arcseconds , and the scatter about the fit is 0.11 arcseconds .    = 5.0 in -0.2 in    we also compared the apparent b - band magnitudes ( @xmath33 ) measured on the 0.9-m and kiss images . since our photometric calibration of the 0.9-m images made use of the original kiss calibration ,",
    "our 0.9-m values for @xmath33 agree well with the kiss values for @xmath33 .",
    "this re - measurement of @xmath33 combined with the correction for @xmath31 , described above , is relevant for probing the effects of low - resolution upon the measurement of @xmath0 ( see equation 1 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : sbcorr ] plots the observed relation between @xmath40@xmath0 ( 0.9-m @xmath0 @xmath25 kiss @xmath0 ) and @xmath40@xmath31 .",
    "since the kiss and 0.9-m apparent magnitudes show good agreement , the difference in the measured values of @xmath0 must be due to solely the change in @xmath31 between the kiss and 0.9-m images .",
    "therefore we can compute the correction for the effective surface brightness , @xmath40@xmath0 , such that it depends on only @xmath40@xmath31 .",
    "@xmath42    figure [ fig : sbcorr ] plots the observed values of @xmath40@xmath0 and @xmath40@xmath31 for the 14 kiss elgs along with a curve illustrating the analytical correction given by equation 2 .",

    "the ability of our local lcbg candidates to provide meaningful mass and sfr comparisons with the higher - z lcbgs requires that these galaxies be genuine lcbgs .",
    "typical methods of identifying nearby lcbg analogues usually employ cut - offs in surface brightness , luminosity , and color , and can not guarantee that the galaxies are true examples of lcbgs .",
    "indeed , we only can pick out those galaxies that are _ likely _ to be lcbgs . considering the nature of kiss",
    ", we believe that we are identifying those elgs that possess the same properties as the lcbgs at intermediate and high redshifts , and thus , those galaxies that are most likely to be true lcbgs .",

    "all criteria are limited by the angular resolution of the kiss survey direct images .",
    "certainly , lcbgs are _ not _ agn , and are most often characterized by vigorous star - formation . therefore the sample was selected from a subsample of kiss galaxies known from follow - up spectra to have star - formation as their primary form of activity .",
    "all values given for @xmath44 color and all magnitudes used in the kiss sample selection are corrected for galactic absorption using the values of @xcite .",
    "additionally , to select this sample , we used the corrected values of @xmath0 determined from the analysis outlined in the previous section .",
    "a total of 17 kiss star - forming galaxies meet the selection criteria proposed by r. guzmn : @xmath0 ( _ b_-band ) @xmath1 mag arcsec@xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath6 with @xmath17 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 .",
    "we use this absolute magnitude limit for the selection of kiss lcbgs despite our use of @xmath4 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 by kiss .",
    "since this absolute magnitude cut corresponds to @xmath45 with @xmath4 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 , we apply a slightly more stringent cut for absolute magnitude by 0.15 magnitudes when we use @xmath3 as one of our selection criteria .",
    "this sample of lcbgs is partially determined by the resolution selection effects described in section [ kcomp ] and shown in figure [ fig : distsel ] .",
    "these effects dictate that the majority of identified lcbg candidates will be located at distances far closer than the kiss redshift limit of @xmath46 . considering that the median half - light diameter of the 17 lcbgs is 4.21 kpc , figure [ fig : distsel ] indicates that likelihood of finding an lcbg beyond @xmath47 mpc is low .",
    "a further implication of this effect is that any comparison of the kiss lcbg sample with other kiss star - forming galaxies will be skewed .",
    "kiss star - forming galaxies detected at greater distances will be , on average , considerably larger in diameter and more luminous . to account for these effects , and to improve the completeness of our lcbg sample , we impose on it a distance limit of 185 mpc ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "16 of the 17 kiss lcbgs lie within this boundary , and according to the resolution thresholds marked on figure [ fig : distsel ] , any galaxy within 185 mpc of the milky way with a diameter equal to or greater than @xmath49 kpc will be resolved in the kiss images .    figure [ fig : properties ] shows kiss elgs that lie within 185 mpc of the milky way and have @xmath50 .",

    "instead , the star - forming galaxies form a more - nearly continuous distribution in color and @xmath0 , as one might expect . at intermediate redshifts , @xcite find that in the parameter space of @xmath0 and b@xmath25v color , lcbgs separate themselves more cleanly than in any other parameter space from ordinary irregular , elliptical , and spiral galaxies . a plot from @xcite",

    "while it is not possible to definitively select between these options , the high current star - formation rates exhibited by the lcbgs would appear to be inconsistent with the first of these choices , while the higher central mass densities implied by the high sb@xmath55 of the lcbgs is inconsistent with the second ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "hence , we conclude that the lcbg candidates appear to be offset slightly to the left of the kiss sfgs , indicating that their luminosities may not be representative of their masses . while this latter point is likely true in general , for all star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , lee _ etal .",

    "hence , since there are 16 lcbgs in the distance - limited sample , the computed volume density carries with it a 25% uncertainty .",
    "a handful of previous studies have derived estimates for the space densities of lcbgs at intermediate and high redshifts .",
    "for example , @xcite find the volume density of lcbgs at redshifts between 0.4 and 0.7 with m@xmath64 -18.5 to be @xmath65 , and that of lcbgs at reshifts between 0.7 and 1.0 with m@xmath64 -18.5 to be @xmath66 .",

    "the uncertainty that arises from different absolute magnitude cut - offs at different redshifts can be alleviated somewhat by applying a * brighter * cut - off to our sample . by making our local sample s luminosity limit consistent with the absolute magnitude limit of the higher - z samples , rather than extrapolating the high - z absolute magnitudes to lower luminosities ( as was done by @xcite as described above ) , one avoids introducing some large and very uncertain corrections .",
    "for example , @xcite had an absolute magnitude limit of -20 ( using h@xmath69 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 ) for their sample at @xmath70 , which corresponds to an absolute magnitude limit of @xmath71 for h@xmath72 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 .",

    "specifically , employing a color limit to select local lcbgs based on the corrected rest - frame colors of higher - redshift lcbgs is a bit problematic .",

    "the combination of high central mass densities and high central gas densities make bcds particularly efficient at forming stars .",
    "we assume that this is no accident : bcds are by their nature well equipped to be making stars .",
    "by analogy , one might argue that lcbgs are predisposed to make stars efficiently because they too represent the extreme high surface brightness , high central mass density end of a continuous distribution , albeit for more luminous galaxies . in this picture ,",
    "lcbgs are preferentially in a star - forming phase for a large fraction of the time .",

    "the drop in density of lcbgs may be directly linked to the fall in the star - formation rate density between @xmath18 to the present ( e.g. , madau _ etal .",
    "_  1996 , 1998 ) .",
    "the galaxies still exist , they are simply in a somewhat less active state . in this scenario , lcbgs are not pathological outliers , but rather the most compact galaxies at the extreme end of a continuous distribution of gas - rich star - forming galaxies",
    ".    it should be relatively simple to test the above hypothesis .",
    "a combination of high spatial resolution surface photometry in the optical and vla hi mapping in the radio could be used to evaluate the stellar- and gas - mass distributions of the local lcbg candidates .",
    "a direct comparison of these properties between the lcbgs and a sample of  normal \" galaxies would reveal whether our lcbgs are structurally different from the non - lcbgs .",
    "these same observations would be extremely helpful in establishing their dynamical masses as well .",
    "this latter parameter is essential for showing clearer linkage between the local samples of lcbgs with the intermediate- and high - redshift analogues .",
    "efforts are already underway in this regard . as a first step in determining gas and dynamical masses ,",
    "we have obtained single - dish hi observations with the arecibo 305-m radio telescope for the sample of lcbgs accessible from arecibo , along with a control sample of  normal \" star - forming galaxies . with these data",
    ", we will derive hi masses and provide at least a rough estimate for the dynamical masses ( werk _ etal .",
    "_  2005 ) for our lcbgs",
    ". we will also be able to ascertain which of our galaxies would be suitable for follow - up vla mapping .",
    "in addition , we have begun acquiring higher resolution optical images of our lcbgs , with the goal of being able to perform detailed surface photometry .",
    "in addition , these more detailed images will allow us to carry out a morphological analysis of our sample of local lcbgs , that will provide clues as to whether their intense starbursts are caused by mergers and/or interactions , or are simply the result of their intrinsically compact nature .",
    "finally emission line - widths measured from high - resolution spectra combined with near - infrared images and our hi mass estimates could settle the debate about the masses of lcbgs .",
    "in this paper , we present a sample of local analogues to the intermediate- and high-@xmath8 lcbgs .",
    "we selected our sample from only those kiss galaxies that are actively forming stars .",
    "due to resolution effects , we limit our sample to only those galaxies within 185 mpc of the milky way .",
    "the sample of lcbgs is defined by the following criteria : a surface brightness limit of @xmath79 mag arcsec@xmath2 , an absolute magnitude limit of @xmath80 , and a color cut - off of @xmath6 with @xmath4 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 .",
    "a total of 16 kiss sfgs meet these criteria .",
    "we have compared some of the properties of the kiss lcbg candidates to those of a comparison sample of kiss sfgs , and a comparison sample of century survey ( cs ) galaxies that are supposed to represent `` normal galaxies . '' on average , the kiss lcbg candidates have a higher tendency to emit detectable radio continuum flux , have higher h@xmath7 luminosities indicating strong star - formation properties , have slightly lower than expected metal abundances for kiss galaxies of their luminosity , and considerably smaller size than those galaxies in both kiss and cs comparison samples .",
    "we have calculated the volume density for the sample of local lcbg candidates to be @xmath10 .",
    "this value indicates a substantial density evolution of lcbgs , which is in general agreement with the predictions made by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , precise estimates of the density evolution of the lcbgs are difficult , due to the large uncertainties in the values of the volume density for higher - redshift populations .",
    "we have utilized the cs database in an attempt to select a sample of local non - active lcbgs in order to constrain the density of non - star - forming lcbgs .",
    "we found no additional non - star - forming lcbgs , although one weakly star - forming ( possibly post - starburst ) galaxy was recognized .",
    "we postulate that lcbgs are structurally predisposed for star - formation , and that their compact nature may be indicative of a high central gas concentration that drives ongoing star - formation .",
    "the need for a local sample of lcbgs is well documented .",
    "much of the published work on these galaxies speaks to the need for a representative local comparison sample that will help settle the debates over their size and mass , morphology , and low- redshift counterparts .",
    "we conclude that our sample of local lcbg candidates contains galaxies that are likely to be local versions of the more distant lcbgs .",
    "this local sample provides the starting point in our ongoing study of the properties and evolution of lcbgs .",
    "funding for this work was provided by an nsf presidential faculty award to jjs ( nsf - ast-9553020 ) .",
    "additional support for our ongoing follow - up spectroscopy campaign came from continued funding from the nsf ( nsf - ast-0071114 ) and wesleyan university .",
    "we are grateful to the anonymous referee for several helpful suggestions that improved the presentation .",
    "we thank the numerous kiss team members who have participated in spectroscopic follow - up observations during the past several years , particularly caryl gronwall , drew phillips , gary wegner , jason melbourne , laura chomiuk , kerrie mckinstry , robin ciardullo , and vicki sarajedini .",
    "special thanks to rafael guzmn for providing us with information about selection criteria for lcbgs , and several useful discussions .",
    "finally , we wish to thank the support staffs of kitt peak national observatory , lick observatory , the hobby - eberly telescope , mdm observatory , and apache point observatory for their excellent assistance in obtaining both the survey data as well as the spectroscopic observations .",
