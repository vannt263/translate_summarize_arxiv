    "recently much attention has been devoted to experimental and theoretical studies of motor proteins , that are active enzyme molecules that move along linear molecular tracks by consuming a chemical energy and transforming it into a mechanical work @xcite .",
    "motor proteins play important role in many biological processes @xcite .",
    "while conventional molecular motors are powered by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) or related compounds , it was shown recently that a protein collagenase utilizes a different mechanism for the transport along the collagen fibrils @xcite .",
    "it fuels its motion by a proteolysis , i.e. , the collagenase catalyzes the cutting of a protein filament at some specific positions , and the enzyme molecule is always found on one side of the proteolysis site . since the collagenase molecule can not cross the broken site once the cleavage of the filament occurred , it leads to the biased diffusion of the motor protein along the fibril .",
    "it was suggested that the unusual dynamics of collagenase can be described by the so - called `` burnt - bridge model '' ( bbm ) @xcite . in bbm",
    "the motor protein molecule is viewed as an unbiased random walker that hops along the one - dimensional lattice composed of strong and weak links .",
    "strong links are not affected when crossed by the walker , whereas the weak links ( `` bridges '' ) might be destroyed ( `` burnt '' ) with a probability @xmath1 when the walker passes over them ; and the burnt bridges can not be crossed again .",
    "however , theoretical studies of dynamic properties of motor proteins in bbm are still very limited . limiting cases of very low burning probabilities and @xmath2 case",
    "have been analyzed earlier by using spatial continuum approximation @xcite , which is valid only for very low concentrations of bridges .",
    "but experimental studies @xcite suggest that the density of proteolysis sites on collagen is significant .",
    "a different approach was utilized by antal and krapivsky @xcite , who investigated discrete - time dynamics of motor proteins .",
    "they calculated the mean drift velocity of the particle @xmath3 for periodically distributed bridges for the entire range of parameters , while the dispersion @xmath4 has been determined only for the special simple case of @xmath5 for both periodic and random bridge distributions .",
    "however , it was pointed out later @xcite that the realistic description of motor protein dynamics requires a continuum - time description since motor proteins move following poisson statistics .",
    "recently , we developed a theoretical approach to investigate continuous - time and discrete - time dynamics of collagen motor proteins in bbm @xcite for the periodic distribution of weak links .",
    "first , it was shown that the special case of @xmath5 corresponds to the motion of the single particle on infinite periodic lattices @xcite , for which all dynamic properties can be obtained exactly .",
    "for the general case of @xmath6 we developed a simple method by considering a reduced chemical kinetic scheme , and some dynamic properties have been explicitly calculated .",
    "however , there is a deficiency with this method . in this approach the analytical expressions for the dispersion and correlation functions",
    "have not been obtained , although the simultaneous knowledge of the velocity and dispersion is crucial for understanding mechanisms of motor protein transport @xcite .",
    "the goal of the present work is to develop a comprehensive theoretical method that allows one to determine _ all _ dynamic properties of motor proteins in bbm for general sets of parameters .",
    "in our model the single motor protein is represented by a particle that jumps along an infinite one - dimensional lattice with transition rates in both directions assumed to be equal to one , as illustrated in fig .",
    "1 . the size of the lattice spacing is also taken to be equal to one .",
    "the lattice consists of strong and weak bonds .",
    "whereas the random walker has no effect on the strong links , it destroys the weak ones with the probability @xmath0 when crossing them .",
    "after the bridge is burnt , the particle is always assumed to be to the right of it .",
    "in addition , it is postulated that all bridges are intact at @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , the trapping of the walker between two burnt bridges can not occur , the particle continuously moves to the right .     when the particle crosses them from left to right .",
    "already burned bridges are shown with dotted lines .",
    "the particle cam hop with equal rates one step forward or backward unless the link is already destroyed . ]",
    "the dynamic properties of the molecular motors in bbm strongly depend on the details of the bridge burning @xcite .",
    "there are two possibilities of breaking weak links . in the first model , which we term a forward bbm , the bridge burns only when crossed from left to right , but it always stays intact if crossed in the opposite direction . in the second model , which describes a forward - backward bbm ,",
    "the bridge is burnt when crossed in either direction .",
    "both models are identical for the case of @xmath5 because of irreversible burning . however , for the general case of @xmath6 the walker s dynamics in two scenarios , although qualitatively similar , can show some difference @xcite . for simplicity , in this paper we will only analyze forward bbm ,",
    "although our method can be easily extended for forward - backward bbm .",
    "two parameters specify the dynamics of the molecular motors in bbm : the burning probability @xmath0 and the concentration of bridges @xmath8 .",
    "another important factor that strongly influences the dynamic properties is the distribution of bridges @xcite .",
    "two possible distributions of weak links , periodic and random , have been considered so far @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will investigate the periodic bridge distribution , in which the bridges are located at a constant distance @xmath9 lattice spacings apart from each other .",
    "thus weak links can be found at the lattice sites with the coordinates @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is integer ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . periodic distribution of bridges is more realistic for the description of dynamics of collagenases @xcite .",
    "our theoretical approach is a generalization of the method proposed by derrida for explicit calculation of dynamic properties of the random walker on infinite periodic one - dimensional lattices @xcite .",
    "it was shown earlier that the original version of derrida s method can be directly applied to the special case of bbm with @xmath5 ( with periodic bridge distribution ) @xcite , and it leads to analytical computations of all dynamic properties of the system in this special case .",
    "however , the direct application of the method can not be done for the case of the bridge burning with the probability @xmath12 , since it is unclear how the transition rates depend on @xmath0 .",
    "we propose a method that explicitly takes into account the presence of the weak links , the feature that is not accounted for in the application of the original derrida s method .",
    "let us define @xmath13 as the probability that at time @xmath14 the walker is at point @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) given that the right end of the last burnt bridge is at the point @xmath17 .",
    "we note that @xmath18 and @xmath19 are some integers , and @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the probability to find the random walker @xmath22 sites apart from the last burnt bridge at time @xmath14 .",

    "another interesting example is @xmath132 , when every bond in the lattice is a potential bridge that can be burned . in this case",
    "all auxiliary functions can be easily obtained , @xmath133 substituting these results into eqs .",
    "( [ vv ] ) and ( [ finald ] ) , we obtain for the dynamic properties the following expressions , @xmath134 it is interesting to note that in this case the mean velocity depends on the burning probability , while the dispersion is independent of @xmath0 . when @xmath135 the diffusion constant is equal to one because it corresponds to unbiased motion of the random walker",
    ". however , any nonzero probability of burning changes the dynamic behavior at large times significantly by lowering fluctuations .",
    "thus for any @xmath136 the particle is always in the biased diffusion regime in the stationary - state limit .    generally , in the case of very low burning probability , i.e. , when @xmath137 , we have the following expressions for the auxiliary functions ( to the leading order in @xmath138 ) , @xmath139 then the dynamic properties are equal to @xmath140    in the opposite limiting case , when @xmath141 , our calculations to the leading order in @xmath142 produce , @xmath143 the corresponding expressions for the mean velocity and dispersion are given by @xmath144 the value for the dispersion is rather unexpected since in the case of no bridges ( @xmath145 ) we have @xmath146 , as expected for the unbiased diffusion of the random walker .",
    "to test our theoretical approach , monte carlo computer simulations of dynamic properties of motor proteins in the burnt - bridge model have been developed .",
    "we performed computer simulations by using methods discussed in detail in ref .",
    "since the velocity of the motor protein in bbm has already been determined in analytical calculations and monte carlo simulations , we concentrated our efforts on computations of dispersion @xmath65 .",
    "diffusion constants or dispersions have been calculated in simulations via the formula @xmath147 .",

    "2 . comparison of numerical computations with analytical predictions indicates a very good agreement for all conditions , and it validates our theoretical method . as shown in fig .",
    "2a , @xmath150 is a monotonically decreasing function for any fixed value of @xmath151 , and it decreases more slowly for larger values of burning probability @xmath0 .",
    "this behavior is expected since the burning of the bridges limits the mobility of the hopping particle . at very low concentration of bridges ( @xmath152 ) dispersion for all values of @xmath153 approached a limiting value of 2/3 , in agreement with analytical predictions . however , this limiting value is less than @xmath146 for the case of the diffusion on the lattice without bridges .",
    "note also large fluctuations in @xmath150 obtained from monte carlo simulations for @xmath154 due to the fact that the system , probably , has not reached a stationary state yet .",
    "dispersion as a function of the burning probability shows a more complex dependence , as illustrated in fig .",
    "for @xmath135 the dispersion is equal to one , as expected , for any @xmath8 .",
    "the increase in @xmath0 first significantly lowers the dispersion and then @xmath155 starts to increase .",
    "this non - monotonic behavior is rather unexpected because one can naively argue that the increase in the burning probability should limit fluctuations of the particle , leading to the decrease in the diffusion constant .",
    "one can understand the dynamics of the single particle in bbm in the following way .",
    "irreversible burning of the bridges limits the motion of the particle in one direction , but it allows the particle to move further to the right until it crosses another bridge that will burn .",
    "it leads to larger effective hopping rates , resulting in the larger dispersions .",

    "in addition , @xmath157 for very low probabilities of burning ( @xmath158 ) and @xmath159 .",
    "[ fig2 ]   [ b ]    the presented theoretical analysis provides a full description of dynamics of motor protein in bbm .",
    "most observed trends in the dynamic properties can be well understood , however there are several surprising observations .",
    "first , in the limit of very low concentration of bridges ( @xmath152 ) our analytical calculations and computer simulations yield @xmath160 which is not equal to @xmath146 expected for the case of @xmath145 .",
    "this jump in the dispersion is a signature of the dynamic phase transition @xcite , that separates unbiased diffusion regime ( @xmath145 ) from biased diffusion behavior ( @xmath161 ) .",
    "another interesting observation is the fact that @xmath162 for @xmath132 for _ any _ value of the burning probability @xmath0 .",
    "this can be understood by analyzing the trajectories of the particle .",
    "after the bridge is burned the random walker spends most of its time near the burning position that behaves like a hard wall and it rarely diffuses forward .",
    "this lowers significantly fluctuations in the system , and the dynamics of the particle become independent of the burning probability @xmath0 .",
    "a comprehensive theoretical approach to describe the dynamics of motor protein particles in one - dimensional burnt - bridge model with periodically distributed bridges is presented .",
    "our theoretical method allows one to calculate exactly all dynamic properties of the system for any set of parameters , and specific calculations are given for the mean velocity and dispersion .",
    "it is found that dispersion is monotonically decreasing function of the concentration of weak links @xmath8 , while the dependence of @xmath4 on the burning probability @xmath0 is more complex .",
    "trends in dispersions are discussed using simple physical arguments .",
    "theoretical analysis also indicates that there is a gap in the dispersions in the limit of @xmath163 , that can be associated with a dynamic phase transition between biased and unbiased diffusion regimes .",
    "in addition , our calculations show that for any concentration of bridges the fluctuations of the particle are lowered .",
    "this is due to the fact that the particle spends most of the time near the last burned bridge that acts as a hard wall .",
    "our theoretical findings are confirmed by extensive monte carlo simulations .    in this paper only periodic distribution of weak links have been considered .",
    "this situation is realistic for collagenases moving along collagen fibrils @xcite , although different distributions of weak links are also generally possible",
    ". it will be interesting to investigate bbm with random distribution of bridges , for which limited theoretical results are available @xcite .",
    "it will also be important to generalize our theoretical approach for studying the dynamics of dimers moving on the parallel lattices in bbm .",
    "there are theoretical predictions that dimers are more effective molecular motors than monomers @xcite .",
