    "a measurement of the linear polarization component along the three cartesian axes of a fixed coordinate system is therefore not sufficient to determine the full excitation field .",
    "it is crucial to make sure that the excitation field does not significantly perturb the level structure of the atomic basis states ( _ e.g. _ , by the ac stark effect ) . in the extreme case that the atom is fully polarized by @xmath148 ,",
    "one reencounters the case of no applied bias - field , and we can only retrieve the magnitude @xmath225 because there is only one dipole strength @xmath226 , and the effective rabi rate is always given by @xmath227    for completeness , we also mention here that it is possible to determine the direction @xmath228 of an unknown quantization axis , when @xmath148 is known in @xmath15 : eqs .  ( [ eq : amplitude_correspondence]a , b ) can be used to obtain two independent equations that determine @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "this can be achieved either by measuring different transitions ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath59 and @xmath58 ) , or by varying the polarization of the excitation field .",
    "we see possible applications in experiments where atoms in unknown , inhomogeneous stray fields are excited with laser light in the optical frequency domain , _",
    "e.g. _ , ( rydberg ) atoms that are subject to stray electric or magnetic fields emanating from nearby surfaces  @xcite .",
    "another possible application is the characterization of fictitious magnetic fields appearing in the context of optical micro traps  @xcite .",
    "we have measured the two - dimensional distribution of the angle @xmath4 between a homogeneous static electric field and a linearly - polarized pulsed rf field centered at @xmath229ghz , and with a temporal gaussian shape of @xmath47ns total pulse duration . to this end",
    ", we determined the rabi rates from direct coherent population transfer between the @xmath230s@xmath231 and the @xmath232p@xmath231 or @xmath232p@xmath233 rydberg states of singlet helium .",
    "the use of pulsed coherent population transfer allowed us to further determine a splitting of the @xmath232p@xmath234 and @xmath232p@xmath235 transitions resulting from a small residual magnetic field not compensated for in our experimental setup that could not be detected from the excitation spectra .",
    "the precision of the excitation - field measurements was better than @xmath236 .",
    "for the specific rf configuration we examined , the rotation of the rf polarization and the changes of its amplitude are compatible with the standing waves we typically observe in the experimental region in which the atomic state is manipulated by the rf field @xcite .",
    "in addition , we have presented a formal analysis of this technique and shown that it can be extended to measure the five independent polarization parameters of an arbitrary optical or rf excitation field from a minimum of five rabi - rate measurements using an atomic four - level system [ fig .",
    "[ fig : pe](a ) ] . depending on the number of resolved transitions in the four - level system",
    ", the quantization axis needs to be rotated at least once , but not more than four times , _",
    "e.g. _ , by rotating an external bias - field .",
    "we have given explicit examples for the most common experimental configurations .",
    "combination of this method with the methods presented in reference @xcite represents a powerful tool for sensing electric - fields .",
    "our setup allows for the determination of the strength and vector distribution of unknown ( stray ) static electric fields and of the strength and polarization of time - dependent ( rf- ) electric fields close to surfaces .",
    "field measurements with a dedicated metrology device based on these principles , using an ensemble of ( helium ) rydberg atoms , should be fast and simple , as the optimal configurations to minimize the number of measurements are known and only frequency or amplitude scans are needed .",
    "additionally , the technique is compatible with cryogenic environments and does not alter the properties of close - by surfaces @xcite . as the transition frequencies of rydberg atoms are easily tuned with small applied electric fields , there are few fundamental limitations for the parameter range where such measurements can be performed .",
    "the method we presented in this article could also be applied to other experiments having the ability to determine rabi rates and to control bias - fields .",
    "we have shown coherent population transfer as a sensitive tool to determine the rabi rates , but a rabi rate can also be extracted from spectroscopic measurements in principle .",
    "the results of this article could be relevant , for example , for determining polarizations or so - called fictitious magnetic fields  @xcite of optical trapping or excitation fields propagating in nano - photonic - crystal structures , which is a prerequisite to trap single atoms within such structures @xcite .",
