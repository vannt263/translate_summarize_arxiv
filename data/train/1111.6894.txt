    ". however , these are aspects that depend critically on the boundary conditions .",
    "indeed , @xcite have presented mean - field calculations of associated convection simulations that agree with each other not only qualitatively in that both are non - oscillatory , but they also agree quantitatively as far as their excitation condition is concerned .    here",
    "we extend previous studies on large - scale dynamos due to turbulent convection in cartesian geometry @xcite to cover a larger parameter space and to explore more thoroughly the effects of boundary conditions on the solutions .",
    "we present runs with imposed shear and find that oscillatory solutions can be found in a limited part of the parameter range studied .",

    "values of @xmath69 near zero refer to runs with rapid ( and nearly rigid ) rotation , whereas small values of @xmath71 are associated with slow rotation . for @xmath72 the flow is rayleigh unstable and thus we limit our study to values @xmath73 .",

    "we focus here specifically on the case of oscillatory solutions .      in our previous studies of convection - driven large - scale dynamos with shear @xcite ,",
    "only non - oscillatory solutions were obtained .",
    "the large - scale field often had a different sign in the convectively unstable layer with respect to the stable overshoot layer , although solutions with a single sign have been obtained at low magnetic reynolds numbers ( see fig .  5 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in cases where @xmath75 ( see fig .  7 of * ? ? ?",
    ". runs with sinusoidal shear and rotation also show non - oscillatory large - scale fields @xcite .    as is evident form table  [ tab : runs ] ,",
    "many of our current runs are also non - oscillatory ; see figure  [ fig : butter1](a ) for a representative result from run  a6 . when @xmath69 is increased from unity , the mean magnetic field begins to show reversals .",
    "this is particularly clear in the kinematic regime in runs  a1a3 .",
    "cycles in the non - linear regime are more irregular and in some cases the dynamo mode changes to a non - oscillatory mode ( run  b1 ) . with @xmath76 ,",
    "another oscillatory regime is found .",
    "these runs tend to show oscillations in the kinematic stage but often switch to a stationary mode in the non - linear regime ; see the time evolution of the horizontally averaged magnetic field components from run  b8 in figure  [ fig : butter1](b ) .",
    "we find that in the parameter regime explored here , non - oscillatory solutions are consistently found near @xmath77 .",
    "this explains the lack of oscillatory dynamos in our previous works where we always used @xmath77 .",
    "this further illustrates the importance of comprehensive parameter studies instead of individual numerical experiments @xcite .",
    "many runs in the @xmath78 regime , especially in set  a , are either subcritical or show very slow growth of the magnetic field and were not run to saturation .",
    "convection is suppressed especially near @xmath79 due to the rapid rotation , decreasing the reynolds number and thus explaining the absence of dynamo action there .",
    "this can seem surprising because in the @xmath78 regime the contributions to the @xmath2 effect due to shear and rotation have the same sign @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the magnetorotational instability can be excited for @xmath80 which may explain the more favourable dynamo excitation in that regime .",
    "however , we find that if a saturated dynamo is present in this regime , also the turbulence is enhanced ( see runs  a13 , a14 , b14 , and b15 ) .",
    "this is associated with the generation of additional large - scale flows that depend on @xmath64 , see figure  [ fig : pub ] .",
    "also the large - scale magnetic fields are @xmath64-dependent .",
    "such modes are not visible in the kinematic stages of the runs .    even in the cases with the clearest oscillatory solutions ,",
    "e.g.  run  a2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : butter2](a ) , the period of the oscillation varies from cycle to cycle .",
    "furthermore , the cycle period is of the order of @xmath81 convective turnover times in this run .",
    "such a long cycle period limits the duration of the simulation to only a few cycles .",
    "the cycle frequency of a saturated @xmath2shear dynamo under the assumption of homogeneity is given by @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the total magnetic diffusivity , @xmath84 is the turbulent diffusivity , and @xmath85 is the wavenumber of the dominant mode of the magnetic field @xcite . because this is valid in the non - linear regime , the quenching of @xmath84 as a function of @xmath54 and @xmath86 can be estimated @xcite .",
    "however , such procedure is not directly applicable here due to inhomogeneity of the system and the fact that a number of other effects are also present ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , rendering eq .",
    "( [ omcyc ] ) inaccurate .",
    "however , provided that we are dealing with a turbulent dynamo , the cycle frequency is likely regulated by the value of @xmath87 .",
    "this suggests that the turbulent diffusivity is quenched by a factor of roughly two to three in run  a2 , compared to the kinematic stage of the same run .",
    "the phase diagram of the horizontal components of the large - scale field averaged over @xmath88 in run  a2 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase](a ) .",
    "the streamwise and cross - stream field components are in antiphase in this case .      in an earlier study we found the appearance of large - scale magnetic fields in rigidly rotating convection @xcite . however",
    ", none of the runs in that paper were run for much more than @xmath81 convective turnover times .",
    "although sign changes of the large - scale fields were seen ( see , fig .  7 of kkb09 ) , the time series were too short to enable any firm conclusions regarding the possibly oscillatory nature of the dynamo .",
    "furthermore , in similar rapidly rotating runs without magnetic fields , the appearance of large - scale vortices has been discovered @xcite .",
    "here we use the hydrodynamical states of runs with large - scale cyclones as initial conditions for our dynamo simulations .",
    "we find that a large - scale dynamo is excited provided the magnetic reynolds number exceeds a certain critical value .",
    "furthermore , as the magnetic fields become dynamically important , the cyclones decay and are absent in the non - linear state .",
    "the large - scale magnetic field is oscillatory in the two cases with different values of @xmath89 that we have considered .",
    "figure  [ fig : butter2](b ) shows the horizontally averaged mean magnetic fields from a rigidly rotating run  c1 where an @xmath1 dynamo is excited . in run",
    "c1 the large - scale fields are only functions of @xmath90 whereas in the more rapidly rotating run  c2 the large - scale fields depend also on @xmath64 and @xmath63 .",
    "furthermore , the oscillatory nature of the solution is not so clear .",
    "figure  [ fig : phase](b ) shows the phase diagram of the horizontal components of the large - scale field in run  c1 . there is a phase shift of @xmath91 .",
    "the saturation level of the dynamo is sensitive to the magnetic reynolds number .",
    "decreasing @xmath54 from 66 to 39 by doubling the value of @xmath17 , decreases the saturation field strength by a factor of three ( run  c1b ) .",
    "another doubling of @xmath17 shuts the dynamo off ( run  c1c ) .",
    "our standard setup in the present paper is to use perfect conductor boundaries at the bottom and vertical field conditions at the top .",
    "changing also the lower boundary to vertical field conditions produces no discernible difference in the solution ( run  c1d ) .",
    "however , imposing perfect conductor conditions on both boundaries decreases the saturation strength to less than a half of the standard setup and decreases the fraction of the large - scale field ( run  c1e ) . we have not , however , studied the @xmath54-dependence of the saturation field strength in this case ( cf .",
    "we have presented results from simulations of turbulent magnetized convection both with an imposed shear flow using the shearing box approximation ( sets  a and b ) and in rigidly rotating cases ( set  c ) . in accordance with previous results ,",
    "we find the generation of dynamically important large - scale magnetic fields . in distinction to our earlier studies , we here vary the relative importance of rotation with respect to shear by covering the range @xmath92 of the relative shear rate @xmath69 .",
    "we find that for @xmath77 the solutions are always stationary , which is in accordance with earlier results . for large @xmath69 , i.e.  slower rotation , and for @xmath93",
