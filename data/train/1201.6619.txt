    "its dependence largely follows the pl spectrum with a small blueshift , commensurate with the expected energy difference between @xmath38 and @xmath39 transition energies .",

    "further , at all probe laser energies where spin noise is detected , the spin noise exhibits the same narrow spectral width at zero applied magnetic field ( as shown in figure 1 of the main text ) , and the measured spin noise has the same behavior in transverse and longitudinal fields as shown in the main text ( verified for a number of different probe energies ) .",

    ", the measurement of @xmath41 can be considered non - perturbative , and spin noise measurements of this type were performed on alkali vapors at large probe laser detunings from the @xmath70 ( d1 and d2 ) lines of potassium and rubidium @xcite , and were also performed on conduction - band electrons in bulk _",

    "the spin noise measurement is not sensitive to transitions lying at the same energy as the probe laser . _",
    "this brings us to the case of measuring spin noise in an inhomogeneously - broadened qd ensemble .",
    "here we tune the laser to directly within the inhomogeneously - broadened distribution of qd transition energies .",
    "as shown above in figure s1 , this maximizes the measured spin noise signal . undoubtedly , those qds in the ensemble that happen to be resonant with the probe laser are optically pumped by the probe laser .",
    "however as noted in the previous paragraph , it is precisely these resonant qds that do not , to leading order , give any spin noise ( moreover , any photogenerated electrons , holes and/or trions that are pumped by the linearly - polarized probe laser are not spin - polarized ) .",
    "rather , the probe laser will be primarily sensitive to those resident holes in qds that have detuned @xmath38 transitions , and these qds are not pumped ( see fig .",
    "s2b ) . in this regard ,",
    "the faraday rotation measurement still functions as a non - perturbative probe of @xmath41 , the net spin polarization of resident holes in the qd ensemble .",
    "the fact that @xmath77 is not sensitive to spins in qd ensembles that are weakly pumped at @xmath78 was demonstrated in several recent ultrafast studies using independently - tunable pump and probe lasers @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , great care is taken to ensure that the probe laser functions only as a passive detector of the resident hole spin fluctuations , and does not inadvertently perturb the measurement of @xmath41 .",
    "primarily , we wish to ensure that the probe laser i ) does not heat the qds which could lead to incorrect spin lifetime measurements , and ii ) does not inadvertently detect any particles ( electrons , holes , excitons or trions ) that are photoexcited by the probe laser itself .",
    "thus we use low probe laser intensities by using low laser power ( @xmath0200 @xmath1w ) and large spot sizes ( @xmath0100 @xmath1 m ) .",
    "although this significantly reduces the measured spin noise signals , it ensures that we operate in a regime where the measured spin correlation times @xmath8 ( _ i.e. _ , the inverse width of the spin noise spectra , @xmath79 ) are independent of probe laser power .    in this regime , figure s2(c )",
    "shows that the measured half - width @xmath15 of the low temperature , zero - field hole spin noise spectrum is independent of the probe laser power .",
    "significantly higher probe laser intensity leads to a broadening of the spin noise peak , indicating shorter hole spin lifetimes .",
    "for the same series of measurements , figure s2(d ) shows the total ( frequency - integrated ) spin noise signal in units of volts of detected signal .",
    "as expected , the total spin noise signal detects no contribution from photoexcited carriers , since it increases nearly linearly with probe laser power ( all else being equal , doubling the laser power simply doubles the voltages at the photodetectors ) .",
    "if the probe laser were inadvertently measuring spin noise from photogenerated ( rather than resident ) particles in the resonant qds , the total spin noise would be expected to increase super - linearly ( doubling the laser power would not only double the voltages at the photodetectors , it would also double  or at least increase  the number of particles being measured , leading to a superlinear dependence ) .",
    "figure s3 shows that magnetic fields in the longitudinal ( * z * ) direction , either real or effective , necessarily lead to some spin noise centered at zero frequency . to demonstrate this , we show spin noise measurements of electron - doped bulk gaas .",
    "free conduction band electrons in _",
    "n_-type bulk gaas are delocalized and sample a huge number of lattice nuclei",
    ". therefore the influence of the fluctuating nuclear spin bath on these free electrons is extremely small . to leading order , the only magnetic fields felt by the electrons are those that are externally applied . in this case",
    ", a purely transverse applied magnetic field @xmath20 uniformly shifts the spin noise of these electrons out to the larmor frequency @xmath80 , and leaves no remnant of spin noise at zero frequency ( figure s3a ) .",
    "this is in marked contrast to the spin noise spectra of qd holes shown in figure 2 of the paper , in which some spin noise clearly remains at zero frequency despite application of a purely transverse @xmath20  this remaining spin noise is due to the longitudinal components of the effective nuclear field @xmath3 that is felt by the holes .",

    "this noise peak is not statistically broadened by the ensemble , since each qd gives some noise at exactly zero frequency .",
    "\\3 ) it shows that , in zero applied field , the high - frequency precessional noise is strongly suppressed as compared to the zero - frequency noise due to the large anisotropy of the hole g - factor .    in marked contrast with electrons , holes couple very anisotropically to in - plane versus out - of - plane magnetic fields .",
    "for _ pure _ heavy holes , the longitudinal ( out - of - plane ) g - factor @xmath89 is finite while the transverse ( in - plane ) g - factor @xmath90 is zero . however , hole eigenstates in typical _",
    "p_-type self - assembled iii - v quantum dots invariably contain some admixture of light hole states in addition to their predominantly heavy - hole character .",
    "this leads to a small in - plane g - factor @xmath90 that is of order 0.15 in our qds , which is about an order of magnitude less than @xmath89 ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "note also that there exists a large inhomogeneous dispersion of these g - factors within the qd ensemble , likely due to differences in qd shape and strain .",

    "in each qd , hole spin precession about @xmath3 induces a high - frequency noise peak at the hole larmor frequency @xmath94 . in addition",

    "s3 above ) . for the purposes of this toy model ,",
    "these peaks are represented by delta functions .",
    "the total noise power contained within the high - frequency peak is generally much smaller than that within the zero - frequency peak , due to the large anisotropy of the hole g - factor .",
    "statistical averaging over the qd ensemble smears the high - frequency precessional noise over a large frequency range . on the other hand ,",
    "the zero - frequency noise peak is contributed to by every qd . _ in our noise experiments , it is precisely the width and lineshape of this zero - frequency peak that we seek to measure _ , as these parameters reveal the intrinsic spin correlation timescales and decay mechanisms of the hole spins . ]    however , in each and every qd , the longitudinal component of @xmath3 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath88 ) , generates a finite time - averaged value of the hole s spin projection , @xmath13 , that does _ not _ decay in time . in a noise measurement , and within the limitations of this toy model , this simply gives a delta function at zero frequency , and applied magnetic fields do not alter the lineshape of this peak .",
    "of course in reality , @xmath13 _ does _ decay because @xmath3 is _ not _",
    "static , and the associated noise peak is not a delta function  _ it is precisely the width and lineshape of this zero - frequency peak that reveals the long - time decay mechanisms of the central hole spins _ that we are interested in .    within this simple model",
    ", it can be shown that the total ( frequency - integrated ) power of the noise peak at @xmath94 is @xmath96    while the integrated power of the noise peak at zero frequency is @xmath97    therefore in the absence of any applied fields ( @xmath98 ) , the noise power at @xmath94 is typically suppressed as compared to the zero - frequency noise by @xmath99 ( except when @xmath88 is very small ) .",
    "this , together with the above - noted fact that ensemble averaging smears out the high - frequency precessional noise over a very broad bandwidth , may explain why we do not observe any clear sign of precessional noise occurring at high frequencies in the absence of applied fields .",
    "only the much larger zero - frequency noise is apparent .",
    "however , as we apply large magnetic fields in the transverse direction ( @xmath20 ) , all the hole noise power is expected to shift to the precessional noise component at @xmath94 , in agreement with our experimental data ( figure 2 of the main paper ) .",
    "further , as we apply large fields in the longitudinal direction ( @xmath23 ) , the total noise power contained within the zero - frequency component will increase only very slightly ( all the noise power is essentially already contained in this peak ) , again in agreement with experimental observation .    finally , note that the above expressions also hold for electrons , in which case @xmath100 and",

    "previous theoretical studies of nuclear spin  co - flips \" ( a flip - flop of two distant nuclei mediated by virtual hole - nuclear spin flips ) revealed non - exponential decay of the central spin due to non - markovian evolution and strongly - correlated dynamics @xcite .",
    "the goal of this section is to show that the time scale of @xmath01  @xmath1s , which roughly corresponds to the inverse width of the spin noise power in zero magnetic field , is in agreement with a simple theory of how nuclear co - flips lead to central spin relaxation",

    "note that in general @xmath110 is complex , reflecting the fact that transverse coupling involves both @xmath111 and @xmath112 spin components , but as this does not influence the following discussion we treat these couplings as real positive parameters .",
    "the large value of @xmath113 and the coupling anisotropy enable a perturbative approach @xcite , in which the zeroth order wave function of a typical state can be approximated to be the eigenstate of the total spin operator along @xmath114-axis , for example ,      where @xmath116 or @xmath117 indicates the state of the hole central spin ( up or down along @xmath114-axis ) and other arrows show states of the nuclear spins .",
    "we will call the expectation value of operator @xmath118 in the state @xmath119 the _ bias _ , and we will denote it by @xmath120 . we will show that this part of the hyperfine coupling resists the flip - flop transitions .",
    "diffusive dynamics of the overhauser field @xmath3 are possible because the couplings of central spin to different nuclear spins are not equal so that exchanging direction of a pair of nuclear spins changes the bias value by the amount @xmath121 . according to the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) , such pair - wise co - flips of nuclear spins happen due to transitions through the virtual states with a flipped central spin .",
    "the accumulation of pair - wise nuclear spin - flips leads to diffusion in the space of overhauser field values .",
    "the expectation value of the central spin follows the direction of the overhauser field .",
    "when the bias changes across the region with @xmath122 , the variation of this direction becomes substantial , corresponding to the relaxation of the central spin expectation value .",
    "there is no direct coupling between the state ( [ zero - order ] ) and the state @xmath123 where @xmath124 means that nuclear spins @xmath106 and @xmath125 change their directions in comparison to the state @xmath126 .",
    "therefore , to estimate the rate of nuclear spin co - flips we use first order perturbation theory to incorporate transitions to the virtual states in our wave functions : @xmath127 where @xmath128 and where @xmath129 means that @xmath106-th nuclear spin is flipped from up to down state , and @xmath130 ensures a normalization .",
    "this definition of a typical state @xmath119 includes fast transition processes to the virtual states @xmath131 .",
    "one can see that @xmath132 already directly couples states @xmath119 and @xmath133 .",
    "further perturbation expansion breaks down because there are many states @xmath133 with almost the same energy as the initial state @xmath134 .",
    "the presence of such quasi - degenerate states leads to incoherent transitions from @xmath126 into one of the states @xmath135 .",
    "the rate @xmath136 of such transitions can be estimated by fermi s golden rule as follows : there are @xmath137 pairs of distinct states @xmath138 ( again , we are considering spin 1/2 nuclei for convenience ) , distributed around the mean value with interval of energies @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is the width of the distribution of @xmath141 around their mean value .",
    "thus the rate , @xmath142 , of an incoherent transition from the initial state @xmath134 to one of the states @xmath133 that differ from @xmath134 by co - flips of two nuclear spins is given by      where @xmath144 is the density of states represented by all possible pairs @xmath145 , and @xmath146 is the strength of a typical coupling between states @xmath145 and the state @xmath119 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath147 .",
    "we use @xmath148 , where according to various estimates , @xmath149 3 - 13 @xmath1ev @xcite is the hyperfine coupling per nuclear spin per unit probability of the hole being in the unit cell that contains this nuclear spin .",
    "the factor @xmath150 is the ratio of volumes of the unit cell @xmath151 ( 0.57  nm)@xmath31 to the volume of the quantum dot , @xmath152 2000  nm@xmath31 .",
    "hence @xmath153 and @xmath154 s@xmath155 .",
    "the fastest spin relaxation happens in states that have initial bias @xmath156 because such states experience comparable couplings along longitudinal ( along @xmath114-axis ) and transverse axes . in such states , changes in total field along",
    "@xmath114-axis ( also the bias @xmath120 ) leads to a substantial change of the orientation of the total field that acts on the hole s spin .",
    "if we consider a state with initial @xmath120 close to @xmath157 we find from ( [ gam ] ) that the typical time of an incoherent transition between states that differ by a co - flip energy is @xmath158 s.    this time @xmath159 should not be confused with a hole s spin relaxation time @xmath8 because a single co - flip does not lead to a substantial change of the total hyperfine field .",
    "moreover , such random transitions can lead both to an increase or a decrease of @xmath120 .",
    "however , accumulation of co - flip transitions leads to a diffusion in the space of bias values .",
    "hence the latter changes with time according to the diffusion law :    @xmath160 where the coefficient @xmath107 reflects the fact that a single co - flip corresponds to a change of the bias of order @xmath107 .",
    "the hole s spin rotation angle becomes of order unity when the change of the bias becomes comparable to the initial bias , @xmath161 .",
    "this gives us an estimate of the hole s spin relaxation time : @xmath162 the experimentally obtained value , @xmath163 ns , is in very reasonable agreement with this estimate .",
    "here we note , however , that the region of bias values with @xmath156 , accounts for only about 10% of statistically possible states of the nuclear spin bath .",
    "when @xmath120 exceeds the size of this region , incoherent flip - flop transition rate is suppressed , as it can be seen from the fact that @xmath120 enters as a second power in the denominator in equation ( [ gam ] ) .",
    "thus , for values of @xmath164 , the flip - flop transition rate is suppressed by a factor 100 , in disagreement with the assumption of a single relaxation time for all quantum dots , which is expected from the lorentzian shape of the power spectrum .",
    "dipole interactions between nuclear and central spins allow additional coupling terms in the interaction hamiltonian , such as @xmath165 that could contribute to the nuclear spin dynamics , but such terms were estimated to be negligibly small for heavy - hole states in quantum dots @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that strains and nonuniform doping introduce high gradients of local electric fields that couple to quadrupole moment of nuclear spins .",
    "quadrupole nuclear interactions with nonuniform electric field often broaden the solid state nmr - lineshapes of nuclei to the mhz range @xcite .",
