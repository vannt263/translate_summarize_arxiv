    "the nuclei of galaxies occupy a privileged position at the bottom of the galactic potential well .",
    "thus the morphology , dynamics , star formation , and chemical enrichment provide important insight into the evolutionary history of galaxies .",
    "indeed galactic nuclei record the history of the material , whether coming from neighbouring galactic regions or accreted through mergers , that has sunk to the dynamical centre over the lifetime of the parent system .    due to its superb spatial resolution",
    ", the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ has been used extensively to image the nuclei of nearby galaxies .",
    "numerous surveys have been carried out to investigate their structure on scales of 10 - 100 pc over a wide range of morphological types .",
    "_ hst _ imaging has shown that about @xmath2 per cent of elliptical @xcite and spiral galaxies @xcite host a nuclear stellar disc ( nsd ) .",
    "nsds are smaller ( scale - lengths @xmath3 pc ) and brighter ( @xmath4 mag arcsec@xmath5 ) than embedded discs in early - type galaxies @xcite , but they never dominate the light distribution of the galactic nuclei , and locally contribute at most half the galaxy surface brightness .",
    "interestingly , independent of the hubble type of their host galaxy , nsds seem to follow the same relation between the central surface - brightness and scale - length as the main discs of lenticular and spiral galaxies and as the embedded discs of early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "various methods have been used to detect nsds .",
    "the simplest , and therefore traditional , method is the unsharp - mask technique to recover non - circular structures in an image .",
    "alternatively , the scorza - bender method @xcite recovers the basic structural properties of a nsd ( central surface brightness , @xmath6 , and the scale - length radius , @xmath7 , inclination , @xmath8 , and major - axis position angle , pa ) by subtracting from the image the best exponential disc model , which is generally assumed to be perfectly thin .",
    "nsds have received attention primarily as probes of the mass distribution since they permit measurement of the mass of central supermassive black holes ( sbhs ) through observation of their stellar kinematics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the study of nsds can also advance our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution since their formation and destruction reflects the assembly history of their host galaxies .",
    "for example , being dynamically cool systems , nsds are fragile and do not survive a major merger . especially in the presence of sbhs of comparable mass , they would be significantly affected by the interaction with a second sbh carried by the merging galaxy @xcite .",
    "therefore , the age of a nsd constrains the epoch of the last major merger of the host galaxy .",
    "different mechanisms have been proposed to explain how nsds form .",
    "the capture of external gas accounts for the origin of the counter - rotating nsd in ngc  4458 @xcite .",
    "indeed , the presence of a kinematically decoupled component is usually interpreted as the signature of gas accretion or merging of satellite galaxies @xcite .",
    "an external origin is also invoked for the gas which formed the stars of the nuclear disc in the early - type spiral ngc  4698 , which is rotating perpendicularly with respect to the main galactic disc @xcite .",
    "the secular infall of gas , perhaps via a barred potential , is an alternative way to funnel pre - enriched material into the galactic centre where it accumulates , dissipates , and forms stars .",
    "this scenario provides a natural explanation for the presence of nsds in barred galaxies ( e.g. , ngc  7332 , @xcite ) . in some cases a bar may even be destroyed in the process , as has been proposed for ngc  4570 , @xcite and ngc  4621 @xcite ) .",
    "examples of on - going formation via dissipation include the nsds in ngc  5845 @xcite and in ngc  4486a @xcite .",
    "however , other nsds are as old as the main body of the host galaxy ( ngc  4128 , @xcite ; ngc  4342 , @xcite ; ngc  4458 , @xcite ; ngc  4621 , @xcite ; ngc  4698 , @xcite ) .",
    "the stellar populations in nsds have been studied in detail in only a few more objects . in ngc  4478",
    "the nsd is younger , more metal - rich and less over - abundant than the rest of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "in contrast the nsd of ngc  5308 is made of a younger and more metal - poor stellar population than the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "both the nsd and bulge of ngc  4570 show an intermediate - age stellar population although the nsd is more metal rich @xcite .    in some cases",
    "a nsd co - exists with a massive and dense nuclear star cluster with typical @xmath9  and effective radius of a few parsecs .",
    "these objects are observed in the centre of both early- ( e.g. ngc  4458 , ngc  4478 , and ngc  4570 , @xcite ) and late - type galaxies ( e.g. ngc  4206 , @xcite ) .    despite recent progress",
    ", no satisfying explanation has been provided for the deposition of the high gas densities that are needed to enable an _ in situ _ formation of nuclear star clusters @xcite .",
    "an alternative scenario for the build - up of nuclear star clusters is the dissipationless coalescence of star clusters sinking to the bottom of the potential well by dynamical friction @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the rate at which the nuclear star cluster grows by accreting young star clusters depends on their formation rate , migration time , and dissolution time .",
    "the resulting compact nuclear star cluster is embedded in a more extended and diffuse component resembling a small pseudo - bulge .",
    "the size of such a disc - like structure in models including the prompt dissolution of star clusters matches that of the observed nsds .",
    "this opens the possibility that nsds may be forming via star cluster accretion .",
    "in addition , the observed scaling relations between the nuclear star cluster masses and the velocity dispersion of their host spheroids and between the sizes of nuclear star clusters and their luminosities can be explained by a dissipationless scenario @xcite .",
    "some nuclear star clusters have a complex structure possessing both a spheroidal component and an elongated ring or disc component with a scale - length of a few parsecs @xcite .",
    "* hereafter h@xmath10 ) and @xcite found that no more than half the mass of the multi - component nuclear star cluster in ngc  4244 could have been assembled in star clusters that migrated and merged at the centre of the galaxy .",
    "they concluded that the rest of the nuclear star cluster mass must have been produced by _ in situ _ star formation . in this paper",
    "we analyse some of the @xmath1body simulations of h@xmath10 to look for the presence of a nsd and to test whether the dissipationless merger of star clusters is a viable scenario for the formation and growth of nsds ( as opposed to nuclear star clusters ) .",
    "the details of the simulations are given in section  [ sec : simulations ] .",
    "section  [ sec : analysis ] describes the analysis of their photometric and kinematic properties based on mock images and kinematic maps of the simulated galaxies ( section  [ sec : data ] ) , including the search for nsds ( section  [ sec : unsharp ] ) , the measurement of their structural properties using the scorza - bender method ( section  [ sec : decomposition ] ) , and the computation of the rotation parameter ( section  [ sec : rotation ] ) .",
    "results and conclusions are discussed in section  [ sec : discussion ] and [ sec : conclusions ] , respectively .",

    "both simulations live at the centre of a @xcite bulge : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the bulge mass and @xmath14 is the scale radius .",
    "we use @xmath15  and @xmath16 kpc .",
    "the bulge is populated by @xmath17 particles with masses ranging from @xmath18  at the centre to @xmath19  further out @xcite ; their softening is related to their mass via @xmath20 , as shown in fig .  8 of h@xmath10 .",
    "we set up model star clusters , ranging in mass from @xmath21  to @xmath22 , using the isotropic distribution function of a lowered polytrope with index @xmath23 : @xmath24^{1/2 } - [ -2 e_{\\rm max}]^{1/2 } \\label{eqn : polytropedf}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 are the phase space coordinates , and @xmath26 is the energy .",

    "its radial extent increases with the number of accreted star clusters as seen from the increase of the radial range where significantly elongated isophotes are measured ( fig .",

    "indeed , @xmath37 out to 1.1 , 2.1 , and 2.4 arcsec from the centre after the accretion of 10 , 20 , and 27 star clusters . in all the time - steps the ellipticity peaks at @xmath38 at about 0.2 arcsec ( 15 pc ) , where the ncs dominates , as shown in the analysis of h@xmath10 , and it gently decreases outwards .",
    "the absence of a sharp peak in the @xmath39 radial profile at the location where nsds reside is the main photometric reason for concluding that no nsd is present , even if the unsharp mask technique shows an elongated structure .",
    "such feature can also be caused by isophotes of increasing ellipticity inwards . therefore unveiling a nsd",
    "requires performing a detailed measurement of the surface - brightness distribution in the nuclear regions .",
    "in addition , the rotation parameter and ellipticity measured from the stellar kinematics are consistent with an anisotropic rotation ( table  [ tab : kinematics ] ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the elongated nuclear structure observed in model a1 is not a nsd , in spite of the fact that the total accreted mass , @xmath40 m@xmath41 , is comparable to that of observed nsds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    on the other hand , the photometric and kinematic properties of the nuclear structure seen in model a2 ( fig .",

    "the rising ellipticity is associated with discy isophotes over a radial range which steadily increases with the number of accreted star clusters ( fig .",

    "the isophotes quickly become round .",
    "the elongated structure rotates as fast as an oblate isotropic spheroid ( table  [ tab : kinematics ] ) .",
    "its surface - brightness distribution can be modelled as an inclined exponential disc with a maximum local light contribution to the total surface brightness of about @xmath44 per cent at 0.4 arcsec from the centre .",
    "the nsd parameters measured in the three time - steps are consistent with each other within the errors .",
    "their mean values from the scorza - bender method are @xmath45 mag arcsec@xmath5 , @xmath46 arcsec ( 38.8 pc ) , and @xmath47 corresponding to @xmath48 l@xmath41 .",
    "the inclination and pa of the line - of - nodes of the nsd and its host bulge are the same within the errors .",
    "the total accreted mass is @xmath49 m@xmath41 and it is consistent with that of observed nsds .    we compared the structural properties of the nsd of model a2 to those of the known nsds @xcite .",
    "we derive the johnson @xmath50-band central surface - brightness of the model nsd from the mean @xmath51-band value using the iraf task synphot .",
    "because this correction depends on the galaxy spectral energy distribution , it is calculated using the spectral template for a sc spiral galaxy by @xcite to match the late morphological type of ngc  4244 .",
    "the resulting shift is @xmath52 .",
    "the mean observed central surface - brightness is corrected for mean inclination as @xmath53 the scale - length and face - on central surface - brightness are close to those of the larger observed nsds and fit on the @xmath54 relation for galaxy discs , as we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : discs ] .",
    "we also compare the total luminosity of the nsd with that predicted by extrapolating the @xmath51-band tully - fisher relation ( * ? ? ?",
    "[ fig : tf ] ) to discs of similar rotational velocity ( @xmath55 km  s@xmath56 ) .",
    "we assume the rotation width of the nsd to be @xmath57 where the luminosity - weighted second - order kinematic moment @xmath58 is measured from the kinematic maps of the simulated galaxy excluding the light contribution of the bulge ( table  [ fig : kinematics ] ) .",
    "we find that the rotation width and luminosity of the nsd of model a2 are consistent with the tully - fisher relation .",
    "similarly we measure the rotational width for the nsds for which both the stellar kinematics and photometric decomposition are available so far ( ngc  4458 and ngc 4478 : kinematics from @xcite and photometry from @xcite ; ngc  4570 : kinematics from @xcite and photometry from @xcite ; ngc  4698 : kinematics from @xcite and photometry from @xcite ) .",
    "their luminosities are offset below the tully - fisher relation in agreement with the earlier findings of @xcite .",
    "the nsds in real and simulated galaxies show a different behaviour in the tully - fisher relation in spite of having similar luminosities and similar maximum light contributions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tf ] ) .",
    "we explain the discrepancy as due to the fact that for real galaxies observations miss a proper decomposition of the line - of - sight velocity distribution .",
    "the rotation widths of nsds in real galaxies are over - estimated due to the contribution of the host spheroid to the kinematics ( in particular to the velocity dispersion ) measured in the nuclear regions .",
    "this is not the case of the nsd of model a2 where we have the actual kinematics of the nuclear disc , making the comparison with the tully - fisher prediction straightforward .",
    "its rotational width increases and the nsd drops below the tully - fisher relation if the measured stellar kinematics includes the bulge contribution . however , then the rotational width ( @xmath59 km  s@xmath56 ) is not as large as in the observed nsds ( @xmath60 km  s@xmath56 ) since its bulge has a lower velocity dispersion compared to the larger spheroidal component of the early - type galaxies hosting the nsds shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tf ] .",
    "we have analysed two @xmath1body simulations from h@xmath10 exploring the dissipationless merging of multiple star clusters into the centre of a galaxy .",
    "the simulations were originally aimed at investigating the photometric , kinematic , and dynamic properties of the nucleus of ngc  4244 which hosts a massive stellar cluster in rapid rotation @xcite . in this paper",
    "we have investigated the images and kinematic maps built from the simulation as if they were real , assuming the galaxy to be at the distance of the virgo cluster .",
    "we have tested the importance of purely stellar dynamical mergers for the formation and growth of nsds by looking for their presence in the nucleus of the simulated galaxies .",
    "our main conclusions can be summarised as follows .    * a flattened merger remnant ( @xmath61 ) with a radius of about 100 pc",
    "is observed in the nucleus of the simulated galaxy when a few tens of star clusters with sizes and masses comparable to those of globular clusters observed in the milky way are accreted onto a pre - existing stellar component at the centre .",
    "this flattened structure forms regardless of whether the pre - existing component is a massive spherical cluster ( as is the ncs of model a1 ) or a rapidly rotating disc ( as is the ncd of model a2 ) and regardless of the amount of accreted mass ( @xmath62 ) with respect to the mass of the pre - existing component ( @xmath63 m@xmath41 ) . *",
    "the merger remnant passes all observational constraints to be a nsd when the star clusters are accreted onto a pre - existing ncd .",
    "the structural parameters of the nsd were obtained by applying the same photometric decomposition adopted for real galaxies based on the analysis of isophotal shapes .",
    "the photometric and kinematic properties of the nsd in the simulated galaxy are remarkably similar to those of nsds observed in the nuclei of real galaxies . in particular , the scale - length ( 38.8 pc ) and face - on central surface - brightness ( 20.24 @xmath50-mag arcsec@xmath5 ) fit on the @xmath64 relation for galaxy discs .",
    "the total luminosity ( @xmath65 l@xmath41 ) is consistent with that predicted by extrapolating the @xmath51-band tully - fisher relation to discs of similar rotational width ( @xmath66 km  s@xmath56 ) .",
    "the mass of the nsd ( @xmath67 m@xmath41 ) is close to that of the few nsds for which it has been measured .",
    "* the independent analysis performed by fitting an exponential disc to the surface - brightness distribution after excluding the light from the bulge finds best - fitting disc parameters in agreement with those derived with the scorza - bender method , showing that the latter is robust . the elongated structures found in the unsharp images are not sufficient proof of the presence of a nsd : the same feature can also be caused by isophotes of increasing inwards ellipticity at small radii .",
    "therefore , to unveil a nsd , performing a detailed measurement of the surface - brightness distribution in the nuclear regions is necessary and the scorza - bender decomposition method is a robust way of doing this . *",
    "the purely stellar dynamical merger of star clusters onto the centre of a galaxy is a viable mechanism for growing a nsd .",
    "this shows that most of its mass ( up to @xmath68 per cent ) can be assembled from already formed stars through the migration and accretion of star clusters onto the galactic centre .",
