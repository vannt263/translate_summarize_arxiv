    "the possibility that dust in intervening dla absorbers could obscure the background qsos has been considered for more than 20 years ( see , e.g. , ostriker & heisler 1984 ) .",
    "fall & pei ( 1989 ) estimate that 30% of the @xmath6 qsos could have been missed by optical surveys and , conversely , that dust could significantly biases surveys from dla systems in the spectra of optically - selected qsos .",
    "pei , fall & bechtold ( 1991 ) find that spectra of qsos showing dla absorption lines are significantly redder than those without dla systems , in an unfortunately small sample .",
    "recently , murphy & liske ( 2004 ) have failed to confirm this finding in a much larger sample of qsos from the sdss survey .",
    "direct evidence that dust may strongly affect the statistics of dla systems is crucially missing for different reasons : ( i ) the qsos from the lbqs survey ( wolfe et al .",
    "1995 ) show a narrow magnitude range ( cf .",
    "1 ) ; ( ii ) a comparison between optically- and radio - selected dla samples ( ellison et al .",
    "2001 ) does not provide strong constraints because of the small size of the radio - selected sample .",
    "instead , the evidence for dust in dla systems is mostly indirect ( pettini et al . 1997 ; boiss et al .",
    "1998 ; ledoux et al .",
    "between 1996 and 2001 , we have observed 243 qsos or qso candidates from the hamburg / eso qso survey at a spectral resolution of @xmath7  , fwhm with the eso ",
    "1.5 m and danish  1.54 m telescopes at eso la silla observatory . after eliminating non - qsos , @xmath8 qsos , bal qsos , or spectra with a too low s / n",
    ", we built a statistically well - defined sample of 188 qsos .",
    "the distribution of these qsos in the @xmath9 plane is statistically undistinguishable from the parent h / eso qso survey , indicating that we have not unvoluntarily biased our surveys while selecting our spectroscopic targets .",
    "the spectra of these objects were systematically searched for absorption lines in a redshift range limited , in the blue , by the wavelength for which the s / n per pixel is 5 and , in the red , by the wavelength corresponding to a receding velocity of 5000 km / s from the qso redshift .",
    "the qsos whose spectra show absorption lines detected at the 5@xmath10 level with rest equivalent width larger than 7.5 ( corresponding to @xmath11 ) were reobserved with uves at the eso vlt .",
    "results for the whole survey are given in the 2nd column of table 1 ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 for easy comparison with previous results ) .",
    "in other words , our mean number density for the whole survey is extremely similar to the one of corals ( ellison et al .",
    "2001 ) , if we take the redshift dependence of @xmath2 into account , and is 50 % larger than that found from the relation @xmath14 ( storrie  lombardi & wolfe 2000 ) .",
    "we also find the cosmological density of neutral gas comparable to previous results .    our qso sample has the particular characteristics of including bright qsos .",
    "we have therefore constituted 2 sub  samples of equal total absorption distance path @xmath15 . these sub ",
    "samples are based on the magnitude @xmath16 of the background qsos . the critical magnitude",
    "to define the 2 samples is @xmath17 . from poisson statistics , we estimate that the probability to obtain the observed number of dla systems in the 2 sub  samples from the same ( mean ) number density is less than 0.003 . figures 2",
    "show a comparison of the values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 for the 2 h / eso sub  samples with 2 sub  samples of the corals survey defined in a similar way .",
    "both the h / eso and corals surveys indicate that @xmath2 and @xmath3 are correlated with the magnitude of the background qsos .",
    "the steep increase seen in both surveys does not take place at the same @xmath16 though .",
    "a possible reason is that the corals qsos have larger redshifts than the h / eso ones .",
    "indeed , ( a ) for ( nearly ) all h / eso qsos , the ly@xmath0 emission line falls within the @xmath16 passband ; this is not the case for a significant fraction of the corals qsos ; ( b ) the flux decrement caused by the ly-@xmath0 forest is larger for the corals qsos than for the h / eso ones ; ( c ) as the mean redshift of the corals survey is larger , any reddening effect caused by the dla systems would be larger in the corals survey than in the h / eso one .",
    "we are currently testing this possibility ."
