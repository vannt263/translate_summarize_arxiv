    "the search for clusters of galaxies at @xmath3 has proven to be particularly difficult , mainly because of the reduced contrast between cluster members and field galaxies .",
    "high-@xmath2 clusters have been searched for using a variety of techniques , including the so - called `` red sequence '' technique @xcite , and the use of both x - ray surveys ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , and infrared surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "recently , @xcite presented a sample of clusters of galaxies from the spitzer infrared array camera shallow survey .",
    "of their 335 cluster candidates in their sample , 12 have confirmed spectroscopic redshift @xmath4 , and a few ( less than 10 ) have photometric redshift ( obtained using photometry in 4 bands , b@xmath5 , r , i , and 3.6@xmath6 m ) in the range @xmath7 .",
    "none of their candidates have either photometric or spectroscopic redshift higher than 1.7 .",
    "a similar effort is being pursued by the sparcs project ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which found no candidates at @xmath8 .",
    "radio galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and quasars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have also been extensively used to find high - z clusters ( see also * ? ? ? * for a review ) , as they are associated with massive elliptical galaxies and clusters in the local universe .",
    "however , it is known that only low power radio galaxies , most of which possess an `` edge - darkened '' radio morphology , namely fr  i @xcite , are almost invariably located in clusters of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and are also associated with the brightest cluster members ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for @xmath9 an increasing fraction of",
    "the more powerful `` edge - brightened '' fr  iis are also found in rich environments(e.g . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the fraction of fr  ii in rich clusters is still lower than that of fr  is .",
    "furthermore , the host galaxies of fr  is are more similar to normal `` inactive '' ellipticals than those of fr  iis .",
    "giant ly@xmath10 emitters , possibly representing protocluster regions , have been discovered around powerful radio galaxies at @xmath11 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "we utilize our newly selected sample of high-@xmath2 low luminosity radio galaxies @xcite ( hereinafter paper  i ) as `` beacons '' for clusters in the unexplored range of redshift . in this letter",

    "unfortunately , the @xmath2-cosmos catalog @xcite does not include our sources .    in absence of spectroscopic data , we take advantage of the recently published catalog of photometric redshifts obtained using 30 bands photometry by @xcite to identify the best candidates . the catalog , which includes objects with i @xmath27 in the deep _ subaru _ area of the cosmos field @xcite represents a significant improvement with respect to the list of @xcite , providing a factor of @xmath28 higher accuracy .",

    "i we showed that our fr  i hosts lie on the k - z relation for more powerful radio galaxy hosts with evolved stellar populations .",
    "note that a large number of `` red '' objects are not marked in the figure . a significant number of those objects ( e.g. the galaxies @xmath58 nw of cosmos - fr  i  03 ) are indeed only bright in the infrared , and do not make the optical selection cut to be included in the @xcite catalog .",
    "these red objects are as bright as or slightly fainter than the radio galaxy host in k - band .",
    "their color is i - k@xmath56 @xmath57 , consistent with evolved stellar populations , and their magnitude is in the range k@xmath56 @xmath59 @xmath60 .",
    "a few other galaxies , which appear slightly less `` red '' than the radio galaxy host ( e.g. the group in the south - east corner of the field of cosmos - fr  i  05 , are simply foreground ( @xmath61 ) galaxies with an old stellar population .    we also perform the same search on 6 randomly selected fields inside the cosmos survey area . for 3-dimensional regions of the same size as the ones described above , we find 28 to 35 objects in the 6 control fields , with a mean value of @xmath62 and a median value of 32 .",
    "this implies an over - density factor of @xmath63 for the mpc environments of the three selected fr  is , statistically significant at the @xmath64 level , when the three candidate cluster fields are combined .",
    "we also checked that doubling the number of control fields does not alter the results .    in fig .",
    "[ isto ] we show histograms representing the photometric redshift distribution of the sources within a 90@xmath49 radius around our radio galaxies ( red histograms ) , compared with the average distribution of an identical area in the control fields . clearly , this assumes that the `` best '' values of @xmath43 are accurate to better than the width of redshift bins , which therefore is chosen to be sufficiently large ( @xmath65 , similar to the photo-@xmath2 accuracy for faint objects at @xmath66 ) .",
    "the figure shows the overdensities of the cluster candidates with respect to the control fields , arguing for the presence of clusters .",
    "the space density enhancements appear to be centered between @xmath67 , thus very close to the fr  is best fit @xmath43 ( indicated by the solid line in each plot ) . for the fields of cosmos  fri   03 and cosmos  fri  226 the distribution of the `` extra '' sources",
    "is spread across a larger redshift range ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "this is not entirely surprising , because of the uncertainty of the photo-@xmath2 estimates .",
    "we checked that the overdensities at @xmath69 are not `` artificially '' generated by foreground clusters coupled with large photo-@xmath2 errors at faint magnitudes .",
    "in fact , they are unrelated to the presence of any concentration of lower-@xmath2 objects . on the other hand , in a few control fields we observe overdensities at @xmath70 , which do not artificially produce any overdensities at higher redshifts .",
    "finally , we note that the two other sources in the range of photo-@xmath2 of interest ( namely cosmos - fr  i  22 and cosmos - fr  i  228 ) do not show significant overdensities with respect to the control fields , at least in the range @xmath71 .",
    "one possibility is that the photo-@xmath2 for these objects is significantly offset .",
    "we identified three cluster candidates with @xmath69 , according to the photometric redshift catalog of @xcite .",
    "the possible existence of clusters is supported by the significant over - density measured on the mpc scale environment of the three selected radio galaxies .",
    "these first results show that the method of using low luminosity radiogalaxies as `` beacons '' for clusters is returning promising candidates .",
    "a systematic study of the whole sample of 37 radio galaxies is under way . that will allow us to determine the typical environment of these high - z sources , and firmly establish whether they are more likely to be associated with clusters than fr  iis in the same range of redshifts .",
    "we have submitted observational proposals to spectroscopically measure the redshift of the candidates .",
    "if confirmed , these would represent extremely important structures that would contribute to fill the existing gap between @xmath72 and @xmath73 in cluster studies .",
    "a study of the fields with high accuracy photometry and deep high angular resolution images ( with the hst ) is mandatory to investigate the spatial distribution and the morphology of the cluster galaxies , to derive the photometric properties of a significant number of member candidates , and assess the existence ( or the absence ) of the color - magnitude relation at these high redshifts .    in summary ,",
    "follow - up observations of these fields from the radio through the x - rays , will allow us to tackle some of the most important questions on the origin of clusters of galaxies and cluster members , to investigate the link between protoclusters at @xmath11 and well formed clusters in the nearby universe and to study the effects of the evolution of the intracluster gas on the radio structures .",
