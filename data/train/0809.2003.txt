    "haldane s conjecture was substantiated through a rigorous theorem by affleck and lieb  @xcite and through the aklt model  @xcite on theoretical site , and through the observation of the haldane gap in spin 1 chains on experimental site  @xcite .",

    "the ground state consists of simple trimer singlets ( each of which is placed on three consecutive sites ) and is three  fold degenerate .",

    "we numerically confirm the validity of the model using exact diagonalization .",
    "we further discuss low  lying excitations and give an outlook for tetramerization in other models .",

    "the trimer ground states will be annihilated by these operators , @xmath45 for @xmath46 or @xmath47 and thus @xmath48 .",
    "the key to the trimer phase is the explicit su(3 ) symmetry at the uls point in fig.[fig : theta - circle ] .",
    "the symmetry emerges because the bilinear  biquadratic @xmath0 heisenberg interaction becomes proportional to the su(3 ) symmetric permutation operator if the bilinear and the biquadratic term appear with the same coefficients ( as it happens at the uls point ) .",

    "we now explain the explicit construction for the su(3 ) hamiltonian which is equivalent to and which describes trimerization .",
    "( a detailed discussion of this hamiltonian for the su(3 ) system can be found in @xcite . )",
    "we consider a spin chain with a fundamental representation @xmath58 of su(3 ) on each lattice site . as mentioned above , for exact trimerization interactions involving four neighboring sites",
    "are required . to find the relevant su(3 ) representations appearing on four consecutive sites , we couple four fundamental representations , @xmath59 .",
    "in the ground state , only the representations @xmath58 and @xmath60 are present . this can be seen by considering four neighboring sites in the ground state configuration ( see fig.[fig : trimer - groundstate ] ) : either three spins are antisymmetrically coupled to a singlet ( @xmath61\\otimes ( 1,0)=(1,0)$ ] ) or pairs of spins are antisymmetrically coupled to anti  fundamental representations @xmath62 ( @xmath63\\otimes \\mathcal{a}[(1,0)\\otimes ( 1,0)]=(0,1)\\otimes ( 0,1)=(1,0)\\oplus ( 0,2)$ ] ) . hence , the projection operator onto the subspace @xmath64 and @xmath65 applied to one of the trimer ground states must be zero , @xmath66 for @xmath46 or @xmath67 if @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath68 label four consecutive sites .",

    "the eigenvalues of the casimir operators for the representations @xmath64 or @xmath65 are both larger than @xmath76 .",

    "even though we can not write down any of the excited states exactly , we are able to elaborate on key properties like the quantum numbers involved .",
    "to create an excitation , we inevitably have to break a trimer , create a domain wall between the degenerate ground states .",
    "there are , however , two different types of domain walls ( see fig.[fig:3-exc ] ( a ) and ( b ) ) which correspond to different excitations .",
    "as explained above , our model exhibits an su(3 ) symmetry , and we may view the trimer singlets as su(3 ) singlets . breaking such an su(3 )",

    "they are coupled such that the internal hilbert space spanned by this excitation is three dimensional , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 .",
    "this second type of triplet excitation is also as a domain wall between two different ground states , between @xmath84 and @xmath90 ( see fig.[fig:3-exc](b ) ) .",
    "since either type of domain wall could in principle decay into two domain walls of the other type , only one type can be an eigenstate of the hamiltonian above .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we have this question numerically investigated for the corresponding su(3 ) model .",
    "we have found evidence that the domain wall placed on adjacent sites as shown in fig.[fig:3-exc](b ) is the elementary excitation . as pointed out above , this domain wall corresponds to an excitation transforming according to the anti  fundamental representation @xmath62 of the su(3 ) model .",

    "fitting data points for @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 yields a huge gap @xmath97 for the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this gap , however , is not the haldane gap exhibited by the antiferromagnetic @xmath0 heisenberg chain or the aklt model , which we understand as due to a confinement force between spinons .",
