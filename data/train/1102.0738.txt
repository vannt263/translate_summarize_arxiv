    "quite a long time ago , wigner  @xcite introduced random matrices in the context of nuclear physics .",
    "he suggested that the highly - excited energy levels of complex nuclei can locally be well represented by the eigenvalues of a large random matrix .",
    "a big nucleus is a rather complex system composed of many strongly interacting quantum particles and it is practically impossible to describe its spectral properties via first principle calculations .",
    "the idea of wigner was to model the spectral properties of the complex hamiltonian of such a big nucleus by those of a large random matrix preserving the same symmetry .",
    "this was a very successful approach in nuclear physics .",
    "since then , the random matrix theory ( rmt ) has gone beyond nuclear physics and has found a wide number of applications in various fields of physics and mathematics including quantum chaos , disordered systems , string theory and even number theory  @xcite .",
    "a case of special interest is the one of gaussian random matrices ( originally introduced by wigner himself ) where the entries of the matrix are gaussian random variables .",
    "depending on the symmetry of the problem , dyson distinguished three classes for the matrix @xmath2  @xcite : @xmath3 the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) : @xmath2 is real symmetric . @xmath3 the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) : @xmath2 is complex hermitian . @xmath3 the gaussian symplectic ensemble ( gse ) : @xmath2 is quaternionic hermitian .",
    "let us write @xmath4 the adjoint of @xmath2 , i.e. the transpose of @xmath2 for the goe , the complex conjugate transpose for the gue and the quaternionic conjugate transpose for the gse .",
    "a gaussian random matrix is a @xmath5 self - adjoint matrix @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath6 distributed according to the law @xmath7 where , for convenience , we have chosen the prefactor @xmath8 of the @xmath9 to be @xmath10 for the goe , @xmath11 for the gue and @xmath12 for the gse .",
    "for instance , for the gue we have @xmath11 and @xmath13 as @xmath14 .",
    "this means that @xmath2 is a @xmath5 complex hermitian matrix with entries @xmath15 and @xmath16 for @xmath17 that are independent ( real ) random variables distributed according to the same centered gaussian law with variance @xmath18 and the @xmath19 are ( real ) independent gaussian variables with mean @xmath20 and variance @xmath21 . in case of gse",
    ", there are @xmath22 eigenvalues , each of them two - fold degenerate and tr in for @xmath12 is defined so that only one of the two fold degenerate eigenvalues in @xmath2 is counted .",
    "+ self - adjoint matrices can be diagonalized and have real eigenvalues .",
    "the joint distribution of eigenvalues of the gaussian ensemble is well known  @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a normalization constant such that @xmath25 ( it depends on @xmath8 ) and the power @xmath8 of the vandermonde term is called the dyson index @xmath26 depending on the ensemble ( resp .",
    "goe , gue or gse ) .",
    "note that we have chosen the prefactor of @xmath9 term in to be the same as the dyson index @xmath8 just for convenience .",
    "this prefactor is not very important as it can be absorbed by rescaling the matrix entries by a constant factor .",
    "in contrast , the value of the dyson index @xmath10 , @xmath27 or @xmath28 , characterizing the power of the vandermonde term , plays a crucial role .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath24 can be computed using selberg s integral  @xcite : @xmath29 $ ] .    because of the presence of the vandermonde determinant @xmath30 in eq .",
    ", the eigenvalues are strongly correlated random variables , they repel each other . in this paper",
    ", our focus is on the statistical properties of the extreme ( maximal ) eigenvalue @xmath31 .",
    "had the vandermonde term been not there in the joint distribution , the joint distribution would factorize and the eigenvalues would thus be completely independent random variables , each with a gaussian distribution . for such independent and identically distributed random variables @xmath32 , the extreme value statistics is well understood  @xcite and the distribution of the maximum , properly shifted and scaled , belongs to one of the three universality classes gumbel , frechet or weibull ( for large @xmath33 ) depending on the tail of the distribution of individual @xmath34 s .",
    "however , in the case of random matrix theory , the eigenvalues @xmath34 s are strongly correlated variables . for strongly correlated random variables there is no general theory for the distribution of the maximum . in case of gaussian random matrices , where the joint distribution is explicitly known , much progress has been made in understanding the distribution of @xmath35 following the seminal work by tracy and widom  @xcite .",
    "this then provides a very useful solvable model for the extreme value distribution in a strongly correlated system and hence is of special interest .",
    "let us first summarize some known properties of the random variable @xmath35 .",
    "its average value can be easily obtained from the right edge of the well known wigner semi - circle describing the average density of eigenvalues . for a gaussian random matrix of large size @xmath33 , the average density of eigenvalues ( normalized to unity ) @xmath36 has a semi - circular shape on a finite support @xmath37 $ ] called the wigner semi - circle  @xcite : @xmath38 the quantity @xmath39 represents the average fraction of eigenvalues that lie within the small interval @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "therefore , eq . means that the eigenvalues of a gaussian random matrix lie on average within the finite interval @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "note also that one can rewrite , using the joint distribution in @xmath41 hence the average density of states @xmath42 can also be interpreted as the marginal distribution of one of the eigenvalues ( say the first one ) .",

    "in fact , the partition function of the continuum two - dimensional pure yang - mills theory on a sphere ( with gauge group @xmath133 ) can be written ( up to a prefactor ) as a discrete multiple sum over integers  @xcite @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the area of the sphere . in the @xmath102 limit ,",

    "actually , a similar @xmath109-rd order phase transition from a weak to strong coupling phase in the @xmath102 limit was originally noticed in the lattice formulation ( with wilson action ) of the two dimensional @xmath133 gauge theory  @xcite and in the vicinity of the transition point the singular part of the free energy was shown to satisfy a painlev ii equation  @xcite .",

    "the advantage of this orthogonal polynomial method to analyse the maximum eigenvalue distribution is twofold : ( i ) one gets the tracy - widom distribution in a simple elementary way ( basically one carries out a scaling analysis of a pair of nonlinear recursion relations near the critical point and shows that the scaling function satisfies a painlev ii differential equation ) and ( ii ) as an added bonus , we also obtain precise subleading corrections to the leading right large deviation tail @xmath147 .",

    "the two regions are connected by a smooth crossover function and the shape of this crossover function is precisely the tracy - widom distribution that describes the ` typical ' small fluctuations of @xmath35 around its mean .",
    "the ` atypical ' large fluctuations to the left and right of the mean are described by large deviation tails that correspond to the two ` phases ' across this phase transition . in qualitative analogy to the two - dimensional yang - mills theory , the left ( left large deviation ) and the right ( right large deviation ) phases correspond respectively to the ` strong ' and ` weak ' coupling phases of the two - dimensional qcd .",
