    "if the transition does occur , is the ratio ( @xmath58 , see equation  [ eq : defbeta ] and equation  [ eq : betaconvenient ] ) of the kinematic term in the hamiltonian ( i.e. , @xmath108 ) to the matter - induced term(@xmath109 ) the only parameter that determines the physical processes that are observed in this energy range ?",
    "second , new solar neutrino experiments will provide accurate measurements of the fluxes of the important @xmath79 and @xmath21be solar neutrino fluxes , which together amount to more than 98% of the total flux of solar neutrinos predicted by the standard solar model .",
    "these measurements will test the solar model predictions for the main energy - producing reactions , predictions that are more precise than for the higher - energy neutrinos . using only the measurements of the solar neutrino fluxes",

    "this comparison will constitute a direct and accurate test of the fundamental idea that the sun shines by nuclear reactions among light elements .",
    "moreover , the neutrino flux measurements will test directly a general result of the standard solar model , namely , that the sun is in a quasi - steady state in which the interior energy generation rate equals the surface radiation rate .",
    "third , future solar neutrino experiments will make possible a precise measurement of the vacuum mixing angle , @xmath110 , as well as a slightly improved constraint on @xmath50 .",
    "the increased robustness in determining mixing angles will be very useful in connection with searches for cp violation .",
    "uncertainties in the cp - conserving neutrino parameters could compromise the determination of the cp violating phase .",
    "fourth , there may be entirely new physical phenomena that show up only at the low energies , the very long baseline , and the great sensitivity to matter effects provided by solar neutrino experiments . the reader will recall that solar neutrino research was initiated to study the solar interior , not to search for neutrino oscillations .",

    "matter effects in the sun would resonantly enhance the mixing in vacuum producing at energies around 1  mev a much stronger deficit than pure lma oscillations .",
    "2 ) . there could be small flavor - changing neutrino - matter interactions  @xcite .",
    "these extra interactions would profoundly modify the conversion probability at energies lower than around 6 mev .",
    "either mechanism would have strong particle physics implications .    in this paper , we have assumed the correctness of all solar neutrino and reactor experiments that have been performed so far or which will be performed in the future .",
    "but , the history of science teaches us that this is a dangerous assumption .",
    "sometimes , unrecognized systematic uncertainties can give misleading results . to be sure that our conclusions are robust",
    ", the same quantities must be measured in different ways .",
    "the existing solar plus reactor experiments provide only loose constraints on the @xmath21be solar neutrino flux , corresponding to approximately a @xmath111% uncertainty at @xmath84 .",
    "we need an experiment to measure directly the flux of @xmath21be solar neutrinos !",
    "how accurate does the @xmath21be experiment have to be in order to provide important new information ?",
    "a measurement of the @xmath112 scattering rate accurate to @xmath113% or better will reduce by a factor of four the uncertainty in the measured @xmath21be neutrino flux .",
    "moreover , the @xmath114% @xmath21be flux measurement will reduce the uncertainty in the crucial @xmath79 flux by a factor of about 2.5 . that improved determination of the @xmath79 flux by a @xmath21be measurement is due to the luminosity constraint . a @xmath21be measurement accurate to @xmath115%",
    "would provide another factor of two improvement in the accuracy of the @xmath21be and @xmath79 solar neutrino fluxes .",
    "all of these improvements are measured with respect to what we expect can be achieved with three years of operation of the kamland experiment .",
    "comparable information can be obtained from a cc ( neutrino absorption ) experiment and from a neutrino - electron scattering experiment if both are performed to the same accuracy .",
    "contrary to what some authors have stated , a @xmath21be solar neutrino experiment is not expected to provide significantly more accurate values for the neutrino oscillation parameters than what we think will be available after three years of operation of kamland .      according to the standard solar model , about",
    "91% of the total flux of the neutrinos from the sun is in the form of the low energy ( @xmath116 mev ) @xmath79 neutrinos .",
    "we can not be sure that we have an essentially correct description of the solar interior until this fundamental prediction is tested .",
    "moreover , the @xmath79 neutrinos are in the range where vacuum oscillations dominate over matter effects , so observing these low - energy neutrinos is an opportunity to test in a crucial way also our understanding of the neutrino physics .",
    "if we really know what we think we know , if the standard solar model is correct to the stated accuracy ( @xmath117% for the total @xmath79 neutrino flux ) , and if there is no new physics that shows up below @xmath118 mev , then a measurement of the @xmath79 flux to an accuracy of better than @xmath115% is necessary in order to significantly improve our experimental knowledge of @xmath119 .",
    "the main reason why such high accuracy is required is that the existing experiments , if they are all correct to their quoted accuracy , already determine the @xmath79 solar neutrino flux to @xmath120% .",
    "( we assume that three years of kamland reactor data will be available , as well as a @xmath121% measurement of the @xmath21be neutrino - electron scattering rate . )",
    "as described above , an accurate measurement of the @xmath79 solar neutrino flux will provide a direct test of the fundamental ideas underlying the standard solar model .",
    "the @xmath79 measurement will make possible the determination of the total solar luminosity from just neutrino experiments alone .",
    "the neutrino luminosity can be compared with the photon luminosity to check whether nuclear fusion reactions among light elements is the only discernible source of solar energy and whether the sun is in an approximate steady state in which the rate of interior energy generation equals the rate at which energy is radiated through the solar surface .",
    "the global combination of a @xmath21be experiment , plus a @xmath79 experiment , plus the existing solar data , and three years of kamland would make possible a precise determination of the solar neutrino luminosity . a @xmath79 solar neutrino experiment accurate to 5%",
    "would make possible a measurement of the solar neutrino luminosity to 4% and a 1% @xmath79 experiment would determine the solar luminosity to the accuracy implied below : @xmath122      assuming that the @xmath5 neutrino flux ( a @xmath123 mev neutrino line ) is measured instead of the @xmath79 neutrino flux , we repeated the global analyses of existing and future solar and kamland data .",
    "the global analyses show that a measurement of the @xmath112 scattering rate by @xmath5 solar neutrinos would yield essentially equivalent information about neutrino oscillation parameters and solar neutrino fluxes as a measurement of the @xmath112 scattering rate by @xmath79 solar neutrinos .",
    "the estimated best - estimates and uncertainties in the parameters are almost identical for the analyses we have carried out for @xmath79 and @xmath5 neutrinos .",
    "large water cherenkov detectors can make a unique and important test of mater oscillations using @xmath23b solar neutrinos .",
    "only a very large detector will have an event rate that is sufficiently high to detect with statistical confidence the day - night effect with solar neutrinos , an effect which is a characteristic signal of matter - induced neutrino oscillations ( the msw effect ) .",
    "motivated by the uno proposal  @xcite , we suppose for specificity that a future cherenkov detector will have a fiducial volume seven times that of super - kamiokande and that this detector can measure neutrino - electron scattering above 6 mev .",
    "we also assume that the backgrounds and the photo - multiplier coverage ( @xmath124% ) will be similar to the super - kamiokande experiment .",
    "the best - fit lma solution predicts a 2 % day - night difference in @xmath112 scattering event rates , which can be observed as a @xmath125 effect in approximately ten years . a water cherenkov proton decay experiment would also provide a much more precise measurement ( much better than 1 % ) of the total event rate for the scattering of @xmath23b solar neutrinos by electrons .    a first detection of the very rare but high energy @xmath7 neutrinos should also be possible .",
    "we estimate that a measurement of the @xmath7 flux with the hypothesized proton decay detector should achieve a @xmath125 or better accuracy over ten years .",
    "this result assumes that the bp04 predicted @xmath7 flux is correct .    for these measurements of solar neutrinos to be successful",
    ", the proton decay detector should be placed at a good depth with an active shield .",
    "special care should be taken to make sure that radon contamination is low .",
    "frequent calibrations should be made to ensure that the detector sensitivity and the detector threshold do not vary significantly , in an unknown way , from day to night .",
    "the procedure for performing the day - night calibrations should be included in the planning for the next generation proton decay detector .",
    "the study of solar neutrinos with large water cherenkov detectors is an ideal complement to the study of nucleon decay .",
    "the event rate for nucleon decay can not be predicted with confidence , although the importance of just one or a few events is enormous .",
    "the event rate for @xmath23b solar neutrinos can be predicted with great confidence and is enormous , about 31,100 events per year .",
    "somewhat paradoxically , the study of @xmath23b solar neutrinos could turn out to be the bread and butter project of next generation water cherenkov proton decay detectors .",
