    "the study of non - equilibrium dynamics of quantum field theories due to a time dependent mass or coupling has applications to many areas of physics .",
    "this has played a key role in our understanding of quantum field theory in cosmological backgrounds @xcite and has , in recent years , been used as holographic descriptions of cosmological solutions in asymtptotically anti - de - sitter spacetimes @xcite . in condensed matter physics , the problem has received a lot of attention in recent times due to its experimental relevance to cold atom systems @xcite .",
    "there are several theoretical motivations to study this problem .",
    "one question relates to the issue of thermalization .",
    "suppose we start with a field theory in its ground state .",
    "now consider changing the coupling in time at some rate , eventually reaching some other constant value at late times .",
    "the question is : does the system reach a steady state at late times , and if so , does the steady state resemble a thermal state in any sense ?",
    "another issue involves the dynamics of a field theory when the time dependent coupling approaches or crosses an equilibrium critical point .",
    "this problem is of relevance to , and was initially studied in the context of , phase transitions in an expanding universe @xcite . in this case , adiabaticity will be inevitably lost close to criticality and the subsequent dynamics will carry universal signatures of the critical point . for slow dynamics ,",
    "a simple scaling hypothesis can indeed be used to show that several quantities such as density of excitations and excess energy scales with the rate of quench according some universal power - law which is determined solely by the universality class of the critical point @xcite . unlike equilibrium critical phenomena , there is no established theoretical framework to understand such universal behavior , and for strongly coupled field theories there are few theoretical tools to study this problem .",
    "remarkable exceptions in this regard are systems in @xmath11 dimensions , where methods of boundary conformal field theory can be used to obtain results for correlation functions for an abrupt quench from a massive theory to a critical point@xcite .",
    "it is thus important to accumulate as many `` data points '' as possible by examining individual models .    in this paper",
    ", we use large - n methods to study the non - equilibrium dynamics of the @xmath0 nonlinear sigma model in @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "we consider a time dependent coupling @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 is the ramp rate and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are initial and final values of @xmath6 ) such that the system is initially , at @xmath16 , in thermal equilibrium at a temperature @xmath17 in the disordered ( paramagnetic ) phase , and study the behavior of the mass gap of the model during and/or subsequent to this dynamics .    using the keldysh formalism ,",
    "we show that at leading order in large @xmath2 the gap function is determined in terms of the time dependent coupling by a coupled set of differential and integral equations .",
    "for an initially slow variation of the coupling , a derivative expansion can be used to reduce these equations to a single _ inhomogeneous _ differential equation for the gap function , where the departure of the coupling from its equilibrium critical value acts as a source term . near the critical point",
    ", adiabaticity breaks down .",
    "we determine the condition for breakdown of adiabaticity and show that it leads to a kibble - zurek type scaling relationship .",
    "we then describe a self - consistent numerical procedure to solve the coupled set of equations for arbitrary rates of change of coupling , and use this procedure to study the time dependence of the gap function as we approach close to the equilibrium critical point in the gapped phase .",
    "we find that the gap function always vanishes at a time @xmath7 where the instantaneous value of the coupling , @xmath18 is _ larger _ than the equilibrium critical point at @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "( we use the normalization of @xcite where @xmath21 . )",
    "we chart out the dependence of @xmath5 on the ramp rate @xmath13 and the initial temperature @xmath17 .",
    "we then study the evolution of the mass gap of the model subsequent to a sudden change in @xmath6 and verify that the system does not exhibit thermalization up to a time @xmath7 till which we can numerically track such an evolution .",
    "this result is consistent with known results about the lack of thermalization of vector models in the large - n limit @xcite we comment on the consequence of such an absence of `` fast '' thermalization ( for @xmath22 ) of the gravity dual of this model .",
    "finally , motivated by the derivative expansion , we study the problem for a landau - ginsburg dynamics and compare the time evolution with the @xmath0 problem .",
    "large-@xmath2 quantum quench has been _ indirectly _ studied by using the ads / cft correspondence @xcite to map large-@xmath2 limits of strongly coupled field theories to classical gravity . in these examples @xcite ( which involve @xmath23 matrices , rather than @xmath2 component vectors ) , it is almost impossible to solve the field theory itself , but its dual gravity description is tractable . in contrast , the dual formulation of the 2 + 1 dimensional @xmath0 vector model has been conjectured in @xcite to be a higher spin gauge theory in @xmath8 @xcite which contains an infinite number of massless higher spin fields .",
    "this conjecture has been explored in may papers , see in particular @xcite . in this case",
    "the field theory is tractable , and it will be interesting to see if this teaches us anything about quench and in particular thermalization time of the higher spin theory , specifically because there is an explicit dual map @xcite .",
    "quantum quench in the large-@xmath2 expansion has been studied earlier for the _ linear _ sigma model in @xcite for infinitely fast quenches .",
    "this work does not deal with the issue of scaling behavior near the critical point . a similar work deals with bcs theory with an abruptly changing coupling @xcite .",
    "in contrast , our work in the _ nonlinear _ model concentrates on the dependence of quench dynamics on the rate of quench .",
    "the fact that @xmath24 is larger than @xmath3 is similar in spirit to the phenomeon of stimulated superconductivity found in @xcite and studied in the ads / cft context in @xcite .",
    "the plan of the rest of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ mod1 ] , we use the keldysh formalism to derive a set of equations which determine the time - dependent gap ( which we call the gap function ) in terms of the time dependent coupling .",

    "[ gsud ] we discuss the time evolution of the mass gap subsequent to a sudden change of coupling .",
    "[ conc ] contains concluding remarks . in the appendix we study a landau - ginzburg dynamics related to the @xmath0 problem",
    "the action of the model is given by s = d^2x dt [ 1 - 1 ] where @xmath25 is a @xmath2 dimensional vector with real components . in the large @xmath2 limit ,",
    "@xmath26 with @xmath27 remaining @xmath28 .",
    "the field @xmath29 is a lagrange multiplier which imposes the constraint @xmath30 . redefining fields",
    "= the lagrangian density becomes , up to a total derivative = ( ) ^2 - ( , t ) ( ^2 - ) + n [ 1 - 2 ] where ( t ) = ,   ( , t ) = ( , t ) + ( t ) [ 1 - 3 ] the last term in ( [ 1 - 2 ] ) is field independent and can be therefore ignored .",
    "the partition function can be expressed in the schwinger - keldysh formalism as = _ d _",
    "e^i [ keldysh ] where we have doubled all the fields as usual , and @xmath31 is the action for the lagrangian in ( [ 1 - 2 ] ) .",
    "as is well known , the representation ( [ keldysh ] ) is schematic @xcite- one has to pay attention to the end point of the time contour .",
    "however these `` boundary '' terms do not affect the saddle point equation , though these are important for evaluation of the partition function by the saddle point solution .",
    "one can now integrate out the fields @xmath32 leading to the effective action for @xmath33 , s_eff = ntr  ( d^-1 ) - nd^2x dt [ _ + - _ - ] where @xmath34 is the propagator matrix whose inverse is d^-1 = (    cc ^2-_+&0 + 0 & -^2 + _ -    )    the large - n saddle point equations therefore become = tr  d_++ ,   = tr  ( -d_ ) [ 1 - 6 ] therefore , the saddle has @xmath35 and the equation becomes = d^2x   < , t | d | , t>_[1 - 7 ] where we are considering the problem at a temperature @xmath36 .",
    "note that the equality of @xmath37 and @xmath38 is a feature of the strict @xmath39 limit .",
    "fluctuations around the saddle point will destroy this equality .    the coincident green s function in ( [ 1 - 7 ] )",

    "the equation ( [ 1 - 13 ] ) has to be solved for @xmath42 for a given @xmath27 and substitution of the solution in ( [ 1 - 12 ] ) gives the gap function @xmath43 .    before ending this section",
    ", we note that for a time independent coupling @xmath44 , our formalism reproduces the well - known equilibrium solution @xcite . in this case ,",
    "equation ( [ 1 - 12 ] ) shows that @xmath45 i.e. the gap is now independent of time . the integral over @xmath46 on the right hand side yields the result h_0 ( ) 2 ( - ) = [ 1 - 14 ] here @xmath47 is given by = and @xmath48 is the momentum space uv cutoff .",
    "the equation ( [ 1 - 14 ] ) can be solved for @xmath49 = [ 1 - 15 ] for any non - zero temperature this equation has a solution . at exactly zero temperature",
    "the gap equation becomes h_0 = so that a real solution exists only for @xmath50 .",
    "for @xmath51 the @xmath0 symmetry is spontaneously broken and the theory is massless .",
    "the large - n solution presented above is not valid in this phase , though a valid solution in this phase is well known @xcite .",
    "the point @xmath52 is then a critical point which separates the ordered and the massive phase . at non - zero temperatures , the critical point becomes a cross - over which separates regions of the phase diagram which are qualitatively similar to the ordered and the disordered phases .",
    "the location of the cross - over point is given by @xmath53 which implies @xmath54 for small @xmath17 .",
    "when the coupling @xmath27 varies slowly compared to the mass scale set by the coupling itself , one expects that the gap function @xmath43 evolves adiabatically .",
    "adiabaticity should break down when the gap function becomes small , e.g. near the zero temperature critical point .",
    "let us define h(t ) 2 ( - ) [ 1 - 17 ] to investigate adiabaticity , we first need to find an expansion for @xmath42 in terms of a @xmath43 by solving ( [ 1 - 12 ] ) in a derivative expansion .",
    "this is easily done , and the lowest order result is = + - + [ 1 - 18 ] we then need to substitute this in ( [ 1 - 13 ] ) .    for zero temperature ,",
    "it is possible to perform the necessary integrals and the lowest order result is h(t ) = - + + [ 1 - 19 ] inverting this ( again in a derivative expansion ) we get = h(t ) + ( - [ ] ^2 ) + [ 1 - 20 ] therefore adiabaticity breaks down when | - [ ] ^2 | ~h^2 we will be interested in generic profiles of @xmath27 for which @xmath55 near @xmath16 , e.g. @xmath56 for some dimensional parameter @xmath57 .",
    "for such a profile adiabaticity breaks at a time t_~v^-1/2 which is the usual kibble - zurek scaling for linear quenches .",
    "these result trivially extends to nonlinear quenches .",
    "we note that the breakdown of adiabaticity can be also investigated analytically for low temperatures and the results are qualitatively similar up to exponentially small corrections .",
    "in this section , we determine the value of the coupling where the gap function first becomes zero .",
    "this possibly signals a dynamical instability .",
    "the protocol for @xmath58 that we follow for studying this phenomenon is the following : we start with a fixed @xmath59 inside the disordered phase and with an equilibrium temperature @xmath17 and decrease @xmath6 to @xmath60 at the end of the evolution with a speed @xmath13 . in the following",
    "we will take @xmath61 in all the calculations .",
    "this protocol is realized using g(t)= g_i + ( g_f - g_i ) ^2(vt ) in what follows , we track the time evolution of the gap @xmath62 and focus on finding the largest value of @xmath14 for which the minimum value of the mass gap , @xmath63 , reaches zero at some point during the evolution .",
    "this value yields @xmath5 . since the numerical solution of the gap equation becomes difficult when @xmath64 , we extract the position of the dynamical critical point by extrapolation of @xmath63 as a function of @xmath14 . to elaborate , for each @xmath13",

    "we note at the outset that we have checked that the curve fitting based on such extrapolation typically generated correlation coefficient @xmath66 and standard deviation @xmath67 which shows that errors from such a procedure are minimal .     for @xmath68 ( red square ) and @xmath5 for @xmath69 ( blue circle ) .",
    "the shift in the value of @xmath5 for @xmath68 is carried out to enhance clarity . ]    the numerical procedure we adopt for obtaining @xmath63 for a given @xmath13 and @xmath14 is as follows .",
    "first , we provide initial guess values of @xmath62 for a discrete set of points @xmath70 and numerically solve eq .",

    "we note here that the interpolation was carried out by choosing a set @xmath77 points .",
    "we have repeated some of our calculations with @xmath78 and @xmath79 points and have found that the values of @xmath76 obtained do not change to three decimal places .",

    "we find from fig.[figdcp1 ] that the value of @xmath5 increases with increasing @xmath13 , reaches a maximum around a critical rate @xmath83 which depends on the starting equilibrium temperature , and then decreases as @xmath13 is further increased .",
    "we find @xmath83 reduces with decreasing temperature and the hump flattens .",
    "the existence of @xmath83 can be qualitatively understood as follows . since very slow dynamics in the disordered regime",

    "fixed @xmath7 , the system will eventually enter the quench regime where @xmath5 will be determined by the evolution of @xmath62 with @xmath86 subsequent to the quench till @xmath85 .",

    "[ figdcp2 ] . here",
    "we find that there is a crossover regime around @xmath92 where the behavior of @xmath5 changes from the high temperature region where it shows appreciable variation with @xmath13 to a low temperature regime where it becomes virtually independent of @xmath13 .",
    "note that the saturation of @xmath93 for small @xmath13 is consistent with the shifting of @xmath83 to lower values with decreasing temperature .",
    "we end this section by noting that the dynamical instability of the time - dependent mass gap studied above need not correspond to a phase transition since the nature of the correlators of theory at the point where the time dependent mass gap vanish need not be long - range due to memory effects incorporated in @xmath42",
    ". it would be interesting to study such correlators near the instability ; presently the slow convergence of the numerical solution near the instability prevents us from carrying out such a detailed study .",
    "in this section . we discuss the time evolution of the mass gap @xmath62 subsequent to a sudden impulse imparted to the system .",
    "the impulse is imparted by changing @xmath27 as @xmath94 $ ] with @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "note that with this choice , the system starts its evolution with @xmath59 at @xmath16 .",
    "near @xmath99 , the coupling @xmath6 changes to @xmath100 and back to @xmath15 .",
    "the change takes place within a time window of @xmath101 around @xmath102 and thus appear as an instantaneous impulse for large @xmath13 .",
    "the plot of the subsequent evolution of @xmath103 is plotted as a function of time in fig .",
    "[ figimp ] for several initial temperatures .",
    "we note that for all temperatures , the system does not show any sign of thermalization in the sense that @xmath62 does not approach any constant steady - state values till the time @xmath104 that we track it s evolution numerically .",
    "we believe that this is a manifestation of the lack of thermalization in @xmath0 vector models to leading order in @xmath105 .",
    "we note that from our numerical result , we can not rule out thermalization of the system at longer times ; however , the model certainly do not thermalize for @xmath22 .",
    "this is consistent with the expectation that vector models do not thermalize at large @xmath2 , which is due to the lack of quasiparticle scattering at @xmath106 .",
    "( such scattering in the present models appears in @xmath107 and ultimately leads to thermalization . )",
    "this is in contrast with large - n models of matrices , where thermalization is expected to occur @xcite at the leading order .",
    "this is manifest for the class of such large - n models which have gravity duals , where thermalization is seen as formation of black holes @xcite . in such models , thermalization is almost instantaneous for local operators .",
    "this is also consistent with the fact that the gravity dual of the @xmath0 model is a higher spin gauge theory rather than standard einstein gravity . in usual @xmath108 duals of models of large - n matrices ( e.g. gauge theories )",
    ", thermalization is signalled by black hole formation .",
    "however , a study of the finite temperature properties of the singlet sector of the higher spin model shows that there is no large - n transition at order one temperatures @xcite .",
    "this possibly implies the absence of thermodynamically stable large black holes with order one hawking temperatures in this higher spin theory .",
    "the evolution of the mass gap after a sudden quench at @xmath109 as a function of time till @xmath110 for temperatures @xmath68 ( blue dotted line ) , @xmath92 ( red dashed line ) and @xmath111 ( black solid line ) . ]",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that the nonequlibirum dynamics of the non - linear o(n ) sigma model with a time dependent coupling @xmath27 is summarized by two coupled equations ( [ 1 - 12 ] ) and ( [ 1 - 13 ] ) . whenever a derivative expansion is valid , these equations can be reduced _ formally _ to a single differential equation for the gap function with arbitrarily higher derivatives , equation ( 23 ) .",
    "this latter equation has been used to determine the condition of breakdown of adiabaticity at zero temperature : this led to kibble - zurek scaling .",
    "we then described how these equations can be solved by a self - consistent numerical procedure .",
    "we presented numerical results for the case where the coupling which approaches a constant value deep in the paramagnetic region , and approaches the zero temperature equilibrium critical value in the future , starting with a thermal state .",
    "we found that during the time evolution , the instantaneous value of the gap reaches zero for a coupling @xmath24 which is _ larger _ than the coupling at the equilibrium critical point and studied the dependence of @xmath24 on the quench rate .",
    "finally , we have studied the response of the model to a sudden quench and verified that the model does not exhibit short - time thermalization , and have discussed the consequence of this phenomenon for its gravity dual .",
    "our numerical procedure does not work well near @xmath112 which is the regime of obvious interest .",
    "we are working on different numerical procedures to overcome these difficulties .",
    "it would be interesting to extend this approach to discuss the dynamics when the coupling _ crosses _ the critical point .",
    "this requires a treatment of the saddle point equations in the ordered phase as in @xcite .",
    "finally , our work can in principle be extended to a study of periodic dynamics .",

    "ads / cft dualities are also of this kind : the large - n classical theories are generically _ string _ theories in one higher dimension and contain an infinite number of fields . nevertheless , usually in the strong coupling limit , only a few of these fields are massless ( which is the statement that in the field theory only a few operators have dimensions of order one rather than of order @xmath2 ) . in that case",

    "the presence of humps in the behavior of @xmath121 is intruigingly similar to similar non - monotonicity found in the @xmath0 model .",
    "however , other aspects of these results appear to be quite different from our @xmath0 results . in particular",
    ", while @xmath121 in the lg theory saturates at large speeds , the @xmath134 appears to first rise and then come closer to the equilibrium critical coupling @xmath135 .",
    "it is conceivable that for much larger speeds , @xmath134 rises again and saturates .",
    "however , numerical convergence becomes difficult at high ramp speeds .",
    "it is also conceivable that this difference reflects a fundamental difference between the large - n classical theory of @xmath0 as formulated above and a lg type theory .",
    "as discussed above the gap function is not related to the coupling in a local fashion in time .",
    "the gap equation ( [ 1 - 13 ] ) relates @xmath27 with @xmath42 which depends on the entire function @xmath43 through the differential equation ( [ 1 - 12 ] ) .",
    "it is only in the adiabatic approximation that the gap function satisfies a differential equation with a source given by the coupling - and adiabaticity of course fails when the gap function vanishes .",
    "this is related to the fact that this theory is dual to a theory of an _ infinite number _ of massless higher spin fields , and the gap function is simply one of these fields .",
    "this implies that an effective equation for the gap function would be non - local",
    ". it would be interesting to see if the bilocal collective field theory approach to this duality @xcite can shed any light on this issue .",
