    "ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) are point - like off - nuclear sources with x - ray luminosity , assumed isotropic , @xmath3 erg s@xmath4 .",
    "this corresponds to the eddington limit of a @xmath5 m@xmath6 black hole ( bh ) .",
    "various explanations have been proposed for the nature of ulxs .",
    "ulxs could be associated with high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) powered by stellar - mass bhs with anisotropic x - ray emission ( e.g. king et al .",
    "2001 ) or with super - eddington accretion rate / luminosity ( e.g. begelman 2002 ; poutanen et al .",
    "some ulxs ( e.g. farrell et al . 2009 ) could be even associated with binaries powered by intermediate - mass bhs ( imbhs ) , i.e. bhs with mass @xmath7 .",
    "recent models ( e.g. , mapelli , colpi & zampieri 2009 ; zampieri & roberts 2009 ) suggest that a fraction of ulxs may be powered by massive stellar bhs ( msbhs ) , i.e. bhs in the mass range @xmath8 .",
    "these msbhs might form from the collapse of massive stars , provided that the metallicity of the progenitor star is sufficiently low ( e.g. belczynski et al .",
    "2010 , hereafter b10 ) .",
    "finally , the objects classified as ulxs might actually be a mixed bag of different sources .",
    "the ulxs match the correlation between x - ray luminosity and star formation rate ( sfr ) reported by various studies ( grimm , gilfanov & sunyaev 2003 ; ranalli , comastri & setti 2003 ) .",
    "a number of studies suggest an ( anti-)correlation between ulxs and metallicity , and propose that this may be connected with the influence of metallicity on the evolution of massive stars ( pakull & mirioni 2002 ; zampieri et al .",
    "2004 ; soria et al . 2005 ; swartz , soria & tennant 2008 ; mapelli et al . 2009 ; zampieri & roberts 2009 ; mapelli et al .",
    "2010 , hereafter m10 ; mapelli et al .",
    "2011 , hereafter m11 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the observational hints for a connection between ulxs and metallicity ( section 2 ) , and we present the results of @xmath2body simulations studying the population of x - ray binaries at various metallicities ( section 3 ) . in section 4 ,",
    "we summarize our main conclusions .",
    "m11 analyze a sample of 66 late - type nearby galaxies .",
    "64 galaxies were taken from the sample listed in table  1 of m10 .",
    "the remaining two are i  zw  18 and the interacting pair sbs  0335052/sbs  0335052w1 .",
    "these two objects are important , because they are the only galaxies with metallicity @xmath9 z@xmath6 and with published x - ray observations ( thuan et al . 2004 ) . for each galaxy in the sample , m11 derive a fiducial value for the sfr , for the metallicity ( adopting the calibration by pilyugin & thuan 2005 ; when a metallicity gradient is available , m10 and m11 adopt the value of @xmath10 at 0.7 holmberg radii ) , and estimate the number of ulxs , n@xmath11 , after subtracting the background contamination ( see m10 for details ) .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows n@xmath11 versus sfr for the galaxies in m11 .",
    "this figure points out that n@xmath11 scales almost linearly with the sfr , and it also shows that a galaxy with relatively low metallicity ( @xmath12 z@xmath6 , black filled circles ) hosts on average more ulxs than a galaxy with the same sfr but higher metallicity ( @xmath13 z@xmath6 , red open circles ) .    this trend is confirmed in fig .  [ fig2 ] , where n@xmath14 versus @xmath10 is shown for the same sample of galaxies . the red line in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] comes from one of the models described in m10 . to obtain the red line",
    ", we assumed that n@xmath15 n@xmath16 , where n@xmath16 is the number of msbhs per galaxy , while @xmath17 is the fraction of msbhs that power ulxs .",
    "n@xmath16 was estimated as described in eq .  1 of m10 ( adopting the b10 model for bh formation and a kroupa initial mass function ) , and we assume @xmath18 , which matches the data of m11 .",
    "as shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] , the model in which msbhs power ( a fraction of ) ulxs is able to reproduce the metallicity trend in observed ulxs . on the other hand , linden et al .",
    "( 2010 , hereafter l10 ) perform population synthesis simulations of binaries with different metallicities , and find that the contribution of msbhs to bright x - ray binaries is marginal with respect to that of stellar - mass bhs emitting at super - eddington rate .",
    "l10 explain the excess of ulxs in low - metallicity environments as the effect of metal - dependent stellar evolution , rather than as a consequence of the remnant mass .",
    "l10 analysis considers only field binaries , which evolve in isolation . on the other hand , most stars , and especially massive stars ,",
    "are expected to form in star clusters ( scs , e.g. lada & lada 2003 ) .",
    "furthermore , a large fraction of ulxs are associated with ob associations and with young intermediate - mass scs ( e.g. , goad et al .",
    "2002 ; zezas et al . 2002 ; liu , bregman & seitzer 2004 ; soria et al .",
    "2005 ; abolmasov et al . 2007 ; swartz , tennant & soria 2009 ; tao et al . 2011 ; gris et al .",
    "scs are often collisional environments , i.e. systems whose two - body relaxation time is shorter than their lifetime .",
    "this implies that most binaries in scs do not evolve unperturbed , but undergo a number of three - body encounters ( i.e. close encounters with single stars , e.g. sigurdsson & phinney 1993 ) .",
    "three - body encounters can affect dramatically the orbital properties of binaries .",
    "furthermore , dynamical exchanges can change the members of a binary .",
    "thus , dynamics can alter completely the evolution of a binary with respect to the predictions by population synthesis codes . to check the combined influence of dynamics and metal - dependent stellar evolution on the population of x - ray sources in scs , we ran a set of @xmath2body simulations with the code starlab ( portegies zwart et al .",
    "we included recipes for metal - dependent stellar evolution and for the formation of msbhs ( see mapelli et al .",
    "2013 ) in the public version of the code .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the mass of the bh as a function of the zero - age main sequence ( zams ) mass of the progenitor star , as implemented in our simulations .",
    "we ran over 300 simulations of young ( @xmath19 myr ) intermediate - mass ( @xmath20 m@xmath6 ) scs , with metallicity @xmath21 , 0.1 and 1 z@xmath1 .",
    "the simulated scs follow a king profile ( with adimensional central potential @xmath22 and core radius @xmath23 pc ) , adopt a kroupa initial mass function , and an initial binary fraction @xmath24 .",
    "the core collapse time for these systems is @xmath25 myr , short with respect to the lifetime of massive stars .",
    "the simulations provide information about the formation and evolution of x - ray binaries , powered by both roche lobe overflow ( rlo ) and wind accretion . fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the mass of the bh versus the orbital period of rlo ( crosses ) and wind - accreting ( circles ) binaries .",
    "it is apparent that accreting binaries at low metallicity ( @xmath26 z@xmath1 ) can be powered by msbhs : @xmath27 per cent of all msbhs power wind - accreting systems , while @xmath28 per cent of all msbhs power rlo systems .",
    "interestingly , the vast majority ( @xmath29 per cent ) of accreting binaries powered by msbhs underwent at least one dynamical exchange before starting the accretion . in most cases , the msbh formed from a single star and then became member of a binary via exchange .",
    "in this paper , we reported the results of @xmath2body simulations of intermediate - mass ( 3000 - 4000 m@xmath6 ) young scs with three different metallicities ( z=0.01 , 0.1 and 1 z@xmath6 ) , including metal - dependent stellar evolution recipes and binary evolution .",
    "the aim is to check the importance of dynamics for the population of x - ray sources at different metallicities , and to estimate the probability that a msbh powers an x - ray binary .",
    "we showed that @xmath30 per cent of all the msbhs formed at low metallicity ( @xmath26 z@xmath1 ) power rlo systems . the vast majority of accreting binaries powered by msbhs underwent at least one dynamical exchange before starting the accretion .",
    "our results are in agreement with l10 , as the number of accreting msbhs in unperturbed primordial binaries is negligible .",
    "the key result of our simulations is that msbhs are efficient in powering x - ray binaries through dynamical evolution .",
    "this result indicates that msbhs can power x - ray binaries in low - metallicity young scs , and is very promising to explain the association of many ultraluminous x - ray sources with low - metallicity and actively star forming environments .",
