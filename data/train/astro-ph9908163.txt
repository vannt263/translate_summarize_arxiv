    "as is well known , near - infrared ( nir ) photons are up to 10 times less affected by dust extinction than their visible counterparts .",
    "hence , cosmological surveys based upon nir - selected galaxy samples can probe the universe almost completely through the zone of avoidance in the galactic plane , and moreover have a clearer view of galaxies , virtually unobscured by dust ( especially important for the central regions of spirals and for edge - on spirals ) .",
    "the other main advantage of nir - selected galaxy samples is that they are not biased towards recent star formation , contrary to optically - selected samples ( especially in blue light ) , and hence the nir - selected galaxies are more weighed by their mass , or at least their stellar mass .",
    "however , the iras galaxy samples , heavily weighted towards galaxies with recent star formation , appear to be better tracers of the mass in the universe than are early - type galaxy samples .",
    "the first spectroscopic followups of nir selected galaxy samples show fairly small fractions of galaxies with emission lines in their spectra : 37% in @xmath7 samples",
    "( mamon et al . 1999 ) and 30% in @xmath8 samples ( huchra , 1999 ) , in comparison with 60% in similar depth @xmath9-selected samples .",
    "hence , denis and 2mass will be more weighted towards early - type galaxies and may lead to stronger biases relative to the dark matter than the iras samples , but this remains to be seen ( especially because , contrary to the iras samples , they will have a mix of early- and late - type galaxies ) .",
    "the denis ( deep near infrared southern sky survey ) consortium is undertaking a complete imaging survey of the southern sky ( @xmath10 ) in the gunn @xmath11 , johnson @xmath12 ) , and @xmath13 bands ( epchtein et al .",
    "1997 ) , and at this writing , 62% of the southern sky has been observed ( see http://www.iap.fr/users/gam/denis/slots.html ) .",
    "the completion date is planned for january 2001 .",
    "the denis team has built an ir camera and mounted it on the eso 1 m telescope ( which had previously only done optical aperture photometry ) .",
    "the @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 images are obtained simultaneously through the use of dichroics with integration times of 9 sec . the pixel sizes are @xmath17 in @xmath14 and @xmath18 in @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and the latter two are dithered in 9 sub - exposures of 1 sec each to yield images with a pseudo - resolution of @xmath17 .",
    "star / galaxy separation is performed with classical estimators , and except in the zone of avoidance ( @xmath19 ) , the much higher sensitivity and spatial resolution of the @xmath14 band allow us to base our star / galaxy separation on the @xmath14 images for objects detected in the @xmath15 or @xmath16 images .",
    "we have performed detailed cross - identifications of the denis extractions with the cosmos extractions from @xmath20 photographic plates ( obtained over the world wide web ) , over 8 denis strips , corresponding to @xmath21 .",
    "these strips were randomly selected at typically high galactic latitudes @xmath22 ) from the great majority of strips that are not flagged as poor quality .    to compare the quality of the two surveys , we performed two cross - identifications : 1 ) relative to all denis objects ; and 2 ) relative to cosmos objects ( @xmath23 ) in the exact geometry of the 8 denis strips .",
    "we assumed that all objects , on which both denis and cosmos agreed were galaxies , were indeed galaxies .",
    "we systematically inspected visually the denis @xmath14-band images for all cases with @xmath1 ( our estimated limit for 95% reliable visual classification ) where one of the surveys identified a galaxy while the other called it a star or did not detect it altogether .",
    "objects that both denis and cosmos classify as galaxies have @xmath24 and 95% have @xmath25 .",
    "hence , our estimates of cosmos completeness are limited to @xmath26 .",
    "figure 1 shows the resulting denis ( _ left _ ) and cosmos ( _ right _ ) completeness ( _ dashed _ ) and reliability ( _ solid _ ) as a function of magnitude . while denis achieves better than 95% completeness and reliability over the full range @xmath27 , cosmos has worse than 80% completeness and reliability at @xmath28 , and the numbers get even worse at brighter magnitudes : in particular the completeness falls to below 10% at @xmath29 . at bright magnitudes",
    ", cosmos suffers from the non - linearity of the plate photometry .",
    "its reliability suffers from the blending of low non - linear peaks of double stars , while its strong incompleteness is caused by systematic over - compensation of the photometric non - linearity , thus bright galaxies are classified as even brighter stars .",
    "the strong case for spectroscopic followups of near - ir selected galaxy samples , coupled with the realization that schmidt telescopes offer wide enough fields to sample most efficiently the sky for shallow samples of 510 galaxies deg@xmath30 , has led the aao to replace its existing manually - configured flair ii 92-fiber system on the ukst with a robotized , 150-fiber system , called 6df ( for six degree field ) .",
    "the 6df instrument , currently under construction uses an @xmath31 positioner , adapted to the curved focal surface of the ukst .",
    "the aao has suggested granting 300 nights of dark / grey time during 20012003 to a scientific advisory group ( 6dfsag , see acknowledgments , below ) , to conduct a redshift survey based upon near - ir selected galaxy samples .",
    "the 6dfsag is envisioning a complete spectroscopic followup of @xmath32,@xmath33 denis/2mass selected southern galaxies .",
    "the primary sample should be a 2mass-@xmath16 or denis-@xmath15 selected sample .",
    "moreover , we will add galaxies to form complete subsamples in denis @xmath14 and 2mass @xmath34 , as well as supercosmos @xmath9 and @xmath35 .",
    "because fibers can not be placed closer than @xmath36 to one another , we envision an adaptive tiling scheme , with typically 2 exposures per effective field to minimize the losses due to crowding . at a galaxy density of 7 deg@xmath30 , our 27 deg@xmath37 field will have an average of 189 galaxies .",
    "if 10 fibers are reserved for sky , we will have @xmath38 fibers available for objects per field , hence an average of @xmath39 spare fibers , which we intend to use for other classes of objects such as quasars and/or iras galaxies , as well as allow for cosmic variance of the field density .",
    "the principal motivation of the 6dfsag is to perform a peculiar velocity survey in the full ( @xmath40 ) southern hemisphere . assuming 3/4 dark or grey ukst telescope time and two 4 hours exposures per night , we expect to measure @xmath41 resolution spectra for roughly 12,000 ellipticals and lenticulars at @xmath42,@xmath43 . to limit the survey duration , only the densest half of the fields will be observed .",
    "the line - widths will be coupled with surface photometry ( using denis @xmath14 or 2mass @xmath16 images ) , to yield distances ( with the @xmath44 relation ) and hence peculiar velocities .",
    "we hope to be awarded the time to pursue the peculiar velocity survey during the period 20032005 .    in the meanwhile , the denis - hi consortium has just begun a spectroscopic followup of denis southern galaxies with the nanay radio - telescope .",
    "we estimate that given one - sixth the nanay time , we can reach the estimated 5000 inclined spiral galaxies at @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47,@xmath48 in 20002004 , thanks to the 5-fold increase in sensitivity and velocity coverage that nanay should obtain in the fall of 1999 .",
    "so far , a hundred spectra have been obtained .",
    "the denis - hi and 6df peculiar velocity surveys should increase the coverage of the southern hemisphere from 1500 to 17,000 galaxies , and within @xmath49 , the space density of objects will be 4 times higher than today . therefore , the problems related to the sparseness of the current peculiar velocity samples should disappear with these two surveys , leading to more accurate estimates of bulk flow , @xmath5bias , @xmath6 itself , and especially the primordial density fluctuation spectrum .",
    "i thank members of the denis team , especially n. epchtein , p. fouqu , and j. borsenberger .",
    "thanks also to f. giraud who participated in the comparison of denis and cosmos , and e. bertin for useful discussions on the matter .",
    "i also acknowledge my colleagues on the 6df science advisory group : m. colless , j. huchra , o. lahav , j. lucey , q. parker , e. sadler , w. saunders , and f. watson and on the denis - hi team : g. theureau , i. vauglin , g. paturel , l. bottinelli , j .- m .",
