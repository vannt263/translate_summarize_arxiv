    "the soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ; see @xcite for a recent observational review ) are a unique class of galactic neutron stars that exhibit bright flaring activity in the hard x - ray and soft gamma - ray bands .",
    "perhaps their most unusual and distinctive feature is their hyper - eddington bursts , the so - called `` giant flares , '' of which the 5  march  1979 event @xcite is the most famous example .",
    "based on the few observed events , the sgrs appear to emit their giant flares on a recurrence timescale of years to decades .",
    "they also exhibit softer quiescent x - ray emission with coherent pulsations at periods of 510  s.    the sgrs are generally thought to be young ( @xmath2  yr ) neutron stars ( nss ) with extremely strong magnetic fields ( @xmath3  g ) , i.e.  magnetars @xcite .",
    "this belief has been motivated by their several associations with young supernova remnants ( snrs ) or star - forming regions @xcite , by the energetics and phenomenology of their giant flares @xcite , and by the detection of x - ray pulsations with relatively long ( 510  s ) periods and large ( @xmath4 ) spin - down rates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "historically , multiple bursts from sgr  1900 + 14  gave the first hint of the existence of a new class of gamma - ray transients @xcite , suggesting that , source of the famous 5  march 1979 event , was not alone .",
    "reactivation of sgr  1900 + 14  in 1992 @xcite led to follow - up observations that associated the burst source with a soft , persistent x - ray source @xcite and , possibly , an snr 12  arcmin distant ( g42.8@xmath50.6 ; * ? ? ? * ) . on 27  august 1998 ,",
    "a giant flare with strong 5  s pulsations was detected by several spacecraft @xcite ; this flare remains the strongest gamma - ray event ( in peak flux and fluence ) detected to date from any cosmic source apart from the sun .",
    "arrival - time localization @xcite identified sgr  1900 + 14  as the source , and prompt radio observations detected a fading , non - thermal radio source @xcite coincident with the quiescent x - ray source , a 5.17-s pulsar @xcite .",
    "timing analyses of the quiescent x - ray emission soon revealed that the pulsar was spinning down in magnetar - like fashion @xcite .",
    "observations of the source in the aftermath of the flare demonstrated , in addition , a short - term ( @xmath6hours ) increase in spin - down rate @xcite and associated deviations from simple spin - down @xcite . the radio detection provided the highest - accuracy position for sgr  1900 + 14  ( current as of august  1998 ) : @xmath7 , @xmath8 , with uncertainty @xmath9 in each coordinate @xcite .",
    "the precise localization of sgr  1900 + 14  has since enabled further observations at all wavelengths . @xcite and @xcite have raised questions about the association of sgr  1900 + 14  with g42.8@xmath50.6 ; @xcite have proposed instead an association of sgr  1900 + 14  with an embedded cluster of high - mass stars , 12  arcsec from the source , that is probably located at a distance of 1215  kpc .",
    "additional follow - up observations in the infrared @xcite , optical , and radio @xcite have been undertaken ; although these have not revealed any point - source candidate counterparts to date , the upper limits on persistent emission in the ir band can now constrain accretion disk models for the source ( c.f .",

    "in response we initiated observations of sgr  1900 + 14  with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ , _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ , and very large array , seeking to investigate the numerous transient phenomena that have been associated with the giant flares .",
    "@xcite have pursued a similar agenda with their overlapping set of observations .",
    "our program sought to probe the immediate aftermath of the flare with sensitive x - ray spectral , x - ray timing , and radio imaging observations .",
    "these observations also allow us to investigate the nature of sgr  1900 + 14 .",
    "we observed the position of the radio transient associated with the august  1998 giant flare @xcite from sgr  1900 + 14  with the very large array ( vla ) in its `` b '' configuration on a number of occasions , as part of our regular observing program and using observing time donated by others . a log of these observations is found in table  [ tab : vla ] .",
    "the data were taken in continuum mode with 2@xmath1550  mhz bandwidth . they were reduced and calibrated using standard procedures in aips , and then imaged with the imagr task .",
    "this yielded beam sizes of @xmath16 and @xmath17 at 1.4  ghz and 8.4  ghz , respectively .",
    "we did not detect a source in any of the observations , giving the 3@xmath18 upper limits plotted in figure  [ fig : radio ] .",
    "we observed sgr  1900 + 14  with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ on two occasions after the flare , beginning on 2001  april  22.19 ut and 2001  april  30.97 ut , with durations of 20.8  ks and 18.9  ks respectively , as part of the director s discretionary time allocation , with no proprietary data rights period .",
    "both observations were taken in continuous - clocking mode with the aimpoint on the backside - illuminated acis s-3 detector .",
    "this gave us a time resolution of 2.85  ms and mitigated the effects of photon pileup for the persistent emission , as well as for bursts of modest size , while sacrificing one dimension of spatial information .",
    "the two _ chandra _  observations were coordinated with two observations of the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) whose data were also made immediately public .",
    "due to a change in _",
    "chandra _",
    "planning that was not mirrored by _ rxte _ ,",
    "the first _ chandra _",
    "observation occurred one day after the first _",
    "rxte _  observation .",
    "the second _ rxte_and _ chandra _  observations overlapped as planned .",
    "the _ rxte_observations began at 2001  apr  21.32 ut and 2001  apr  30.99 ut , lasted for 15.2 and 15.6  ks respectively , and had total good - time intervals , after screening of earth occults and intervals of high electron background , of 9.6 and 8.9  ks respectively .",
    "_ chandra _  data were processed , for the most part , according to standard cxc procedures .",
    "first we examined the lightcurve of a background region for high - background intervals ; none were identified .",
    "we then extracted events recorded by the acis s-3 detector and restricted to the energy range 0.310  kev .",
    "we barycentered this data using the axbary tool with a preliminary _ cxo _",
    "we extracted the events from a region 10  pixels ( @xmath19 ) wide .",
    "this region gives source count rates of @xmath20 and @xmath21 for the two observations . for precision timing analyses",
    "we were forced to account separately for the charge - transfer time , that is , the approximately 4  s it takes for the charge packets produced by each x - ray photon from the source to be read out from the center of the acis - s3 chip .",
    "we made this correction in two different ways : first , by following an approximate prescription related to us by the _ chandra _",
    "x - ray center helpdesk staff ; and second , by executing a shell script provided to us by allyn tennant of the marshall space flight center .",
    "results of the two approaches were identical ; however , we note that the latter approach is superior in that it incorporates higher - order corrections for the dither - motion and flexure of the observatory over the course of the observation ; these corrections will make a difference for analyses requiring significantly more precision than ours .",
    "_ rxte _  realtime data were processed according to the protocols described on the _ rxte _  web site ; note that the _ rxte _",
    "pointing was offset from sgr  1900 + 14  by 20  arcmin to reduce contamination from the bright source grs  1915 + 105 , resulting in a factor of 1.5 decrease in count rates relative to direct - pointing observations due to reduced collimator efficiency .",
    "the spectrum was ( particle ) background - dominated at high energies , so timing analyses were performed on 260  kev data only .",
    "our spectral analysis focused first on the _ chandra _  data .",
    "we extracted the events in a large background region and used the cxc tool psextract to bin the source and background event data and generate the appropriate response files .",
    "we then fit the data using the xspec and sherpa packages independently . as a caveat to the results reported below",
    ", we note that the continuous - clocking mode of acis has not yet been independently calibrated for spectral purposes ; our analysis depends on the calibration of the timed - exposure `` faint '' mode of acis s-3 , which telemeters an equivalent quantity of information about each event ( @xmath22 pixel islands ) . to the extent",
    "that photon interaction times in the ccd substrate are negligible compared to the cc single - row clocking time of 2.85  ms , we expect this calibration to be accurate .",
    "pure blackbody fits ( with interstellar absorption ) were unable to fit the spectra , indicating that a harder spectral component was required .",
    "single - temperature thermal bremsstrahlung models were able to fit the data but only with plasma temperatures so high that the resulting spectra in the acis 0.210  kev range were little different from simple power laws ; thus a power - law component became our starting point for the fits .",
    "single power - law ( pl - only ) models ( with hydrogen absorption ) were able to fit the data satisfactorily ( table  [ tab : spec ] ) .",
    "however , the resulting power - law indices are quite steep ( @xmath232.5 ) , requiring high column densities and implying relatively low high - energy fluxes , especially when extrapolated to the _ rxte _  band . adding a blackbody component to the models remedied these possible defects , but",
    "could not be justified in a strict statistical sense ( @xmath24-test probability of 62% for the additional parameters in the joint fit ) . to determine ,",
    "then , whether the pl - only fits were a realistic description of the spectra , we examined the high - energy range of the data in greater detail .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sdecomp ] , above 5  kev the effects of interstellar absorption , or of any @xmath250.5  kev blackbody , on the spectrum are negligible .",
    "we therefore executed our power - law plus blackbody ( pl+bb ) fits in the following manner .",
    "first , we fit a pl to the data in the 510  kev range . at these energies",
    "a bb component is superfluous , and fits are insensitive to the precise amount of interstellar absorption . as indicated in table  [ tab : spec ] , the pl indices for these 510  kev fits are significantly harder than those for the 110  kev pl - only fits : the difference for the first observation is @xmath26 and for the second @xmath27 , giving an overall significance for the distinction of 3.8@xmath18 .",
    "we then froze the pl parameters at their best fit 510  kev values , added a soft ( @xmath28  kev ) bb plus interstellar absorption , and fit the full 110  kev dataset , allowing the bb parameters as well as @xmath29 to vary  note , however , that @xmath29 was forced to be the same for both epochs .",
    "this fit , with fixed pl normalizations and power - law indices , required a soft ( bb ) component at very high confidence . after making this constrained fit , we freed all parameters and fit a final time .",
    "the results of this final fit are given in table  [ tab : spec ] , along with the results of the 110  kev and the 510  kev pl - only fits .",
    "our best - fit pl+bb models are plotted in figure  [ fig : spec ] ( pl - only fits appear indistinguishable ) .",
    "we note that while _ chandra_does not have sufficient sensitivity at high energies ( @xmath30  kev ) to discriminate directly between the pl+bb and pl - only models , other satellites , including _",
    "rxte _  and _ beppo - sax _",
    ", do ; see section  [ sec : phasespec ] for our approach on this point .",
    "therefore we also quote in table  [ tab : spec ] the 210  kev fluxes from the models , as appropriate for comparison with other satellites .",
    "while the 0.510  kev fluxes are very similar for the pl or pl+bb models , there are significant differences in the absorbed 210  kev fluxes of the two models .",
    "no narrow spectral features are apparent .",
    "the absorption `` feature '' near 2  kev is likely to be an instrumental artifact ( si ) .",
    "the 2-@xmath18 upper limit on the flux of a persistent 0.2-kev fwhm emission line in the 57  kev range ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) is @xmath31 , corresponding to an equivalent width at 6.5  kev of less than 150  ev ; narrower lines with similar equivalent widths would have been readily apparent in the data .",
    "we attempted to extract time - averaged spectral information from the _ rxte _  data as well .",
    "however , with the faintness of the source ( which we estimate from our _ chandra _  fits at 2  for three active pcus of the _ rxte _  pca ) , the high background ( @xmath25100  )  some of which is likely due to unresolved sources near the galactic plane  and the non - imaging nature of the pca , we have been unable so far to obtain meaningful results .      to perform a phase - resolved spectral analysis we divided the _",
    "chandra_events into six phase bins , according to the best fit period for each observation .",
    "we constructed a spectrum for each spectral bin independently . with the reduced counts of the phase - binned spectra we were unable to discriminate between multicomponent spectral models and",
    "fit a pl only , fixing @xmath29 to the best - fit value for the pl - only fits to the phase - averaged data set ( @xmath32 ; see table  [ tab : spec ] ) .",
    "whether or not this model is accurate , the fits illustrate the gross variations in spectral shape ( hardness ) with phase exhibited by the source .",
    "we see in figure  [ fig : ps ] that there are moderate variations across the phase , with the beginning of the cycle harder than the end , and with an additional softening at pulse - maximum .",
    "the shape remains similar over the two observations .",
    "as mentioned previously , we were not able to make a direct comparison with the _ rxte _  spectral results due to unresolved background emission in the _ rxte _  data that corrupted the absolute flux levels",
    ". however , we were able to compare the fluxes for pulse on@xmath33off .",
    "specifically , we extracted spectral datasets for the @xmath34 of the phase around the maximum ( on ) and the minimum ( off ) of the pulse for both _",
    "chandra _  and _ rxte _  for the second epoch of ( overlapping ) observations .",
    "our goal was to use the two datasets in combination to make an independent test of the reasonability of the pl+bb fits .",
    "for the _ rxte _  data we fit the pcabackest - subtracted data in the 720  kev range for the on and off datasets with a power - law plus @xmath67  kev gaussian .",
    "we are only interested in the flux difference between these fits so the exact parameterization here is not crucial ; however , we do fix @xmath35 in the fits to @xmath36  , a reasonable value from the _ chandra _  fits .",
    "we determined our uncertainties in the flux difference by exploring the parameter space near the minimum for the on and off datasets , determining one - sigma flux errors for each , and combining these on and off errors in quadrature .",
    "the _ rxte _  fits , combined with this investigation of the errors , demonstrate an on@xmath33off flux difference of @xmath37  ( 720 kev ) .    when we fit the _ chandra _",
    "on and off pulse data using a pl - only model , the best - fit power - law photon indices for the two datasets are quite similar , @xmath38 , and the best - fit flux difference in the extrapolated 720  kev band is @xmath39  .",
    "investigating the parameter space defined by the on and off power - law indices of the fit , which will have the largest effect on the extrapolated _ rxte _  flux , we find that the maximum on@xmath33off flux allowed by the pl - only models is @xmath40  ( 3-@xmath18 upper limit ) .",
    "this value is 2@xmath18 from the actual _ rxte _  flux .",
    "by contrast , the pl+bb fits give an on@xmath33off flux difference of @xmath41  , which is only 0.8@xmath18 different from the _ rxte _  value .",
    "we feel that the combined weight of the 510  kev _ chandra _  fits and the 720  kev _ rxte_-_chandra _",
    "on@xmath33off fits demonstrates that the bb component of the spectral models is indeed required by the data .",
    "we note that @xcite reached the same conclusion by making fits to the summed spectrum of the two _ chandra _  observations .      a cursory examination of the _ rxte _  data revealed several short ( @xmath420.25  s ) , intense ( @xmath2330  ) bursts  as typical for sgrs  in each observation .",
    "we therefore made a systematic search for bursts in all data sets .",
    "we constructed a 1/8-s - resolution light curve for each observation and identified all bins with @xmath234@xmath18 fluctuations above background .",
    "these bursts , detected in one or two adjacent time - bins exclusively , are listed in table  [ tab : bursts ] .",
    "since we do not make a detailed investigation of the burst spectra , burst fluences given in the table should be taken as suggestive only .",
    "exactly one burst is detected in the _ chandra _  dataset .",
    "this event occurred at 2001  april  22.30 , 9079.8  s after the start of the first observation , and contains @xmath2514 photons over 0.27  s for a count rate of @xmath43 times the quiescent rate .",
    "this implies a 0.510  kev x - ray flux of @xmath44 ( for either spectral model ) , and an unabsorbed flux of @xmath45 ( for the pl+bb model ) or @xmath46 ( for the pl - only model ) .",
    "all seven bursts detected during the second _ rxte _  observation occurred during times of simultaneous observation by _",
    "chandra_. examination of the _ chandra _  light curve reveals that several of these bursts were accompanied by a mild excess in the acis count rate .",
    "the excess _",
    "chandra _",
    "counts at the times of the _ rxte _",
    "bursts provide an independent demonstration of the consistency of the absolute timing for both satellites , to a precision of @xmath470.1  s. in the context of the _ chandra _  continuous - clocking observation , this establishes the position of the source on - chip , along the y axis , to @xmath4735  pixels , and the position of the source on - sky to @xmath4718  arcsec from its august  1998 vla position ( the assumed location for all timing analyses ) .",
    "we make a more precise determination of the two - dimensional source position below ( sec .  [",
    "sub : spatial ] ) .",
    "fourier power spectra of the two _ chandra _  observations show a clear pulse peak at the location of the known 5.17  s period of sgr  1900 + 14@xcite . to make a more precise characterization of the pulse period and phase at the start of each observation",
    ", we performed a phase connection of the _ chandra _  data ; this also allowed us to test for variability of the pulse strength over the course of the observation .",
    "the phase connection procedure was implemented by dividing the observation into six sections and folding the data ( a barycenter - corrected light curve with 1/8-s resolution ) in each section about the pulse period . from the folded pulse profile we derived the phase at the start of each section , as well as a phase uncertainty that we determined by monte carlo simulation .",
    "the connection of these phases then provided us with the value and uncertainties for the observation s pulse period and starting pulse phase .",
    "we find the pulse profile of the first _",
    "chandra _",
    "observation to be largely sinusoidal .",
    "there is evidence , at the 2.9-@xmath18 level , for power at the first harmonic of the pulse period ( twice the main pulse frequency ) ; the harmonic power is @xmath48% the power at the fundamental if it is real .",
    "any power at the second harmonic is less than 3.5% the power of the fundamental at 90%-confidence .",
    "the pulse profile of the second _ chandra _  observation has a first harmonic detected with @xmath233-@xmath18 confidence .",
    "its power is @xmath49% the power at the fundamental , marginally consistent with results from the first observation .",
    "any power at the second harmonic is less than 7.2% the power of the fundamental at 90%-confidence for this observation .",
    "folded pulse profiles from the two _ chandra _  observations are shown in figure  [ fig : profiles ] .",
    "we also performed a phase connection on the data from the _ rxte_observations .",
    "the procedure was identical ; however , we used a barycenter - corrected light curve of 1/8-s resolution divided into four sections .",
    "uncertainties from this analysis were greater due to the much larger background in the _ rxte _  data .",
    "the results of our timing analysis are shown in table  [ tab : pulse ] .",
    "a bayesian period - estimator @xcite analysis of the data yielded similar results .",
    "the pulsed signal did not show detectable variation in frequency or strength over the course of any observation , consistent with prior and contemporaneous reports @xcite and with expectations for a slow pulsar such as sgr  1900 + 14 . a global analysis of our results yields a period derivative for sgr  1900 + 14  of @xmath50 at the epoch of the first _ rxte_observation , mjd 52020.5 , consistent with the more precise results of @xcite .",
    "there are no significant variations of the strength or profile of the pulsations with energy for either _ chandra_observation .",
    "the one - dimensional spatial profile is consistent at close radii with an unresolved source , having a gaussian shape with @xmath51 ( c.f .",
    "@xcite have pointed out that at larger radii ( @xmath235  arcsec ) a scattering halo , the product of x - ray scattering off of interstellar dust , is apparent .    with only one dimension of spatial information , an individual observation does not give a precise two dimensional location ( without highly precise timing information ) , but merely confines the source to a one - dimensional locus .",
    "we were able , however , to use the two observations together to obtain a two - dimensional localization as each observation was taken at a slightly different orientation , with roll angles differing by @xmath52 .",
    "when the one - dimensional positions are combined , there is a quasi - elliptical region of overlap centered at @xmath53 , @xmath54 , with statistical 1-@xmath18 error contours of semi - major axis @xmath55 , semi - minor axis @xmath56 , and position angle @xmath57 east of north ( figure  [ fig : pos ] ) .",
    "this position has absolute systematic uncertainties of up to @xmath58 due to _ chandra _  aspect errors , but we have here assumed that the separate observations possess internally consistent aspect determinations to @xmath470.1  arcsec ; this agrees with our experience with other _",

    "their observations covered the time interval from 1  week to 1  month after the burst .",
    "the source was detected in the first observation , 1  week after the burst , and then declined over the course of the following four observations ( 930  d ; fig .",
    "[ fig : radio ] ) . thus  at least for this giant flare  the radio source appears to have peaked about a week after the burst and subsequently undergone a power - law decay .    for the april  2001 flare",
    ", we undertook vla observations beginning 0.17  d after the event and ending almost two weeks later ( table  [ tab : vla ] ) . despite our prompt radio observations",
    ", we did not detect a radio source comparable in strength to the august  1998 flare at any of our five epochs of observation .    the fluence of the august  1998 flare was @xmath59  ( here we include the contribution to the fluence from the initial hard spike and the subsequent softer afterglow ; @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , the fluence of the april  2001 flare was @xmath60  @xcite .",
    "the inferred peak flux of the transient radio source for the august  1998 flare was about 400  @xmath61jy in the 8.46-ghz band .",
    "if the radio flux is proportional to the energy released by the flare then we would expect a peak radio flux of 10  @xmath61jy in the same band some time @xmath60.110  d after the current flare . in this context , as seen from table  [ tab : vla ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : radio ] , our failure to detect a transient radio source is not surprising .",
    "we end by noting a possibly interesting point .",
    "the origin of the transient radio source from sgr outbursts is not well understood .",
    "it is clear that the radio emission is powered by the flare in some way .",
    "could it be that the radio emission arises from internal shocks of the emitted particles ?",
    "alternatively , the radio emission could be from the shock of the ambient gas driven by the burst of particles ( the `` afterglow '' model ) . in this context",
    "we note that the radio emission of the august  1998 flare appears to peak , in the 8.46-ghz band , one week after the burst , suggesting that the emission at this frequency was optically thick .",
    "if so , the flux at earlier epochs may well have been higher at higher frequency .",
    "one way to test this idea would be to observe the burst source at higher frequencies ( @xmath2320  ghz ) at early times .",
    "observatories currently capable of the requisite sensitivity at these frequencies include the vla , the owens valley radio observatory , and the james clerk maxwell telescope ( scuba ) .      with our x - ray observations , we are able to establish that the x - ray source remains unresolved , in one dimension , even at _ chandra _ s extraordinary resolution .",
    "our upper limit of 0.6  arcsec on the fwhm of any persistent extended emission translates into a physical extent of less than @xmath62  pc , where @xmath63 is the distance to the source divided by five kiloparsecs .",

    "our limit on the proper motion of the source becomes relevant if one considers that sgr  1900 + 14  has been proposed to be associated with g42.8@xmath50.6 , 12  arcmin distant , and that the nominal spin - down age of sgr  1900 + 14  was measured , at least initially , to be just 700  yr @xcite .",

    "observations at earlier times @xcite .",
    "spectral parameters for the thermal component in the spectrum are consistent with values reported for the source in quiescence @xcite , and despite the 20% decline in total x - ray flux between our two observations , fitted blackbody parameters show no significant variation  indicating that the variations in source flux are produced solely by the power - law component in the spectrum",
    ". similar fading of the power - law component alone was observed in the wake of the august  1998 giant flare of the source @xcite .",
    "this stability of the blackbody component of sgr  1900 + 14  has been cited as evidence in favor of the magnetar model for sgrs , with the blackbody produced by surface thermal emission and the power law produced in the magnetosphere by , e.g. , inverse compton effects @xcite .",
    "this interpretation must be further strengthened by the observations reported here , as the stability of the blackbody component of sgr  1900 + 14  has now withstood two giant flares as well as substantial excursions in x - ray flux .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of sgr  1900 + 14  thus provides an interesting link between the sgr population and the related population of anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) .",
    "the axps ( see @xcite ) are a group of sources that emit steady , pulsed x - ray emission ( @xmath65 ) with periods and spin - down rates similar to those of the sgrs ; indeed , @xcite used spin properties to argue that the sgrs and axps were related . however , these spin properties are also shared by a growing class of long - period radio pulsars @xcite which seem otherwise unrelated to both the axps  showing no persistent bright x - ray emission @xcite  and the sgrs  showing no bursting behavior .",
    "we must therefore require more evidence than similar spin properties to relate the sgrs and axps .",
    "for some time the x - ray spectra of the two groups appeared to have important differences : the sgrs had relatively hard power - law spectra with photon indices @xmath66 and negligible blackbody contributions @xcite , while the axps had softer spectra , with @xmath67 and @xmath28  kev blackbodies contributing up to 70% of the x - ray flux @xcite .",
    "but this situation has been changing .",
    "observations of the quiescent  found a photon index of 3.2  closer to the nominal axp index than to the that of the other sgrs  and possible evidence for a 0.5  kev blackbody @xcite .",
    "this may put the value of the photon index on a continuum related to burst activity and magnetic field geometry for both groups .",
    "observations of sgr  1900 + 14  in quiescent and active states demonstrated the presence of an underlying @xmath60.5  kev blackbody @xcite .",
    "updated spectral fits of archival _ asca _  data of sgrs and axps have shown that both groups seem to possess blackbody components whose fraction of the overall x - ray emission may constitute another unifying continuum @xcite .",
    "spectral fits to the axp 1e  1048.1@xmath335937 show that it has a hard power - law component reminiscent of the sgrs @xcite . and",
    "finally , optical and infrared observations of sgrs @xcite and axps @xcite have shown that the groups have similar x - ray - to - optical flux ratios , so that this ratio may be a distinguishing characteristic of the two , as a group @xcite .",
    "all of these findings have strengthened arguments for association between the axps and sgrs .",
    "the blackbody component of the sgr  1900 + 14  spectrum , with @xmath0  kev and @xmath68  km , has parameters that are similar to those of other isolated ns candidates ( c.f .",
    "the relatively small emitting radius that we find , significantly smaller than the nominal @xmath2510  km - radius ns , is typically interpreted as either due to restricted emission from , e.g. , the ns polar caps , or as the result of temperature - dependent opacity effects in the ns atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the latter scenario would allow for closer distances , lower surface temperatures , and , potentially , emission from the entire ns surface @xcite .",
    "the absence of any narrow spectral features , to equivalent widths of less than 150  ev , is somewhat surprising given the detection by @xcite of a strong , 400-ev equivalent width , @xmath256.4-kev emission line in the _ rxte _  spectrum of a 1998 august  29 burst of sgr  1900 + 14 . @xcite",
    "discuss two possible interpretations for the feature they observe : first , that it may result from fluorescence of relatively cool iron in the near vicinity of the ns ; and second , that it may result from proton or alpha particle ( he@xmath69 ) cyclotron transitions in the sgr magnetosphere ; these ions would have been liberated by the closely - preceding giant flare of 1998 august  27 .",
    "however , if the line resulted from iron fluorescence then we would expect , with _",
    "s superior spectral resolution , to have substantially greater sensitivity with the current observations ; note that the original emission feature was unresolved by the _ rxte _",
    "similarly , if the line resulted from cyclotron emission by he@xmath69 or h ions liberated by the preceding giant flare , then we would expect to observe such cyclotron emission in the wake of the current 2001 april  18 flare as well . both of these scenarios would generate line emission in bursting and persistent source spectra alike .",
    "our upper limits on the presence of any such feature in the persistent source spectrum therefore seem to imply that the line emission is a function of the properties of ( at least some of ) the bursts alone .",
    "we have observed the soft - gamma repeater sgr  1900 + 14  with high - resolution x - ray ( _ chandra _ , _ rxte _ ) and radio ( vla ) observatories in the immediate aftermath of its 2001  april  18 giant flare .",
    "our detailed study of the _ chandra _  and _ rxte _  x - ray spectra reveals the presence of an underlying thermal component in the spectrum .",
    "this thermal component , which we model as a blackbody , has an effective temperature of @xmath700.5  kev and an effective blackbody radius of @xmath68  km , where @xmath63 is the distance to the source divided by 5  kpc .",
    "this two - component pl+bb spectrum is strongly reminiscent of the spectra of the anomalous x - ray pulsars , further strengthening the association between these two intriguing classes of neutron star .",
    "we detect enhanced , fading x - ray emission from the source , which is modulated by the source s known 5.17  s pulsations and , intermittently , by brief bursts of hard x - rays . detailed studies of the pulsations will be able to determine whether any `` glitch '' of the source was associated with the april  18 flare .",
    "we are able to localize the source to @xmath471  arcsec , and find that the current position remains consistent with the @xcite radio position from august  1998 .",
    "this corresponds to an upper limit of @xmath471  arcsec per year on any proper motion of sgr  1900 + 14 .",
    "the upper limits we derive on any radio emission from sgr  1900 + 14  in the 0.211  d following the flare may have implications for physical models of the post - flare radio emission .",
    "higher - frequency ( @xmath2320  ghz ) observations in the immediate aftermath of future flares will provide stronger constraints for models that predict optically thick emission at lower frequencies .",
