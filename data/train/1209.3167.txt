    "[ fig : sigmad ] , but the results for age and [ @xmath4  profiles are presented and fully discussed in @xcite .",

    "( 1 ) there is no systematic difference between the radial gradients of our 14 s0s ( edge - on galaxies largely free of dust ) and 14 spirals ( edge - on galaxies with prominent dust lanes ) .",

    "in summary , we have shown that the stellar populations at the very centres of the bulges found in barred s0sb galaxies do not differ from those of etgs of the same velocity dispersion .",
    "on larger physical scales , however , these bulges do differ from etgs : they lack the correlation between metallicity gradient and velocity dispersion found in etgs , and their average stellar population metallicity gradients are shallower than unbarred etgs with the same velocity dispersion .",
    "it is clear that the role of bars in transforming the stellar populations of disk galaxies is a significant gap in our understanding of galaxy evolution .",
    "this work suggests several possible avenues for further study .",
    "simulations should attempt to go beyond the qualitative statement that bars should make pre - existing abundance gradients shallower , either by drawing their initial abundance profiles from samples such as @xcite and @xcite , in which @xmath28}$ ] is correlated with velocity dispersion , or by using full cosmological simulations with sufficient resolution to capture bar - driven evolution .",

    "integral - field observations of the boxy / peanut - shaped bulges of edge - on galaxies are the ideal observational tests of such predictions .",
