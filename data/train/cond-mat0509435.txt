    "are free standing smectic films where one can avoid ( in other systems often dominating ) influence of underlying substrates .",
    "these systems provide a realization of many models describing diverse apparently disparate physical phenomena ( phase transitions , frustrations , ferro - electricity , magnetism ) , and an opportunity to study the crossover from two - dimensional to bulk behavior by drawing films of increasing thickness .    for liquid crystal materials with phase sequences in bulk samples",

    ", the tilt direction lies along an intermediate angle .",
    "transitions in the films of tilted smectics in which the high temperature bulk phase is sm@xmath0 and the low temperature phase is tilted hexatic occur in an essentially different way @xcite . in this case",
    "no sequence of discrete layer - by - layer transitions is observed .",
    "after the surface transition into the hexatic structure , the transformation of the film structure on cooling continues in a broad temperature range .",
    "several characteristic temperatures @xmath13 may be pointed at which qualitative changes of the film texture take place .",
    "similar structure and texture transformations were observed in several smectic materials @xcite .",
    "so one may expect that these transformations have common physical nature and occur through a universal mechanism .",
    "however , up to now the mechanisms of these structural transformations and physics behind remain unclear .",
    "our motivations for presenting this paper are twofold .",
    "first , in section [ obs ] , we present detailed systematic studies of structural transformations in thin liquid crystal films with sm@xmath0 to hexatic phase transition .",
    "we go one step further with respect to the results known already ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) investigating all possible structures in one material ( @xmath2 ) at the variation of temperature and thickness .",
    "besides , in section [ th ] we rationalize and interpret our observations in the frame work of simple phenomenological model which includes the minimal number of ingredients , i.e. , it is just at the border between under - fitting models ( those that do not explain the data well ) and over - fitting models ( those that fit the data too well by using too many parameters ) .",
    "although our model is a toy model in the sense of caricaturizing some physical features , when properly interpreted , it can yield quite reasonable values for a variety of measured quantities . a more realistic model will not affect much our conclusions , and transparency of treatment is worth a simplification .",
    "the conclusion section is used to briefly summarize our results and to augment their discussion .",
    "the measurements were made on the schiffs - base compound 4-n - hexyl - n-[4-n - pentyloxy - benzilidene]-aniline ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the sequence of phase transitions in the bulk sample is sm@xmath3  ( @xmath15c )  sm@xmath0  ( @xmath16c ) - hsm@xmath1 . below the hsm@xmath1 in the bulk sample",
    "the transition to a tilted hexatic structure ( sm@xmath10 ) takes place .",
    "free - standing films were prepared by drawing the liquid crystal in a smectic phase across a circular 4 mm hole in a thin glass plate .",
    "the experimental set - up enabled simultaneous optical observations and reflectivity measurements .",
    "the thickness of the film was determined by the reflected intensity from the film in the `` backward '' geometry @xcite .",
    "observations of film structure and phase transitions were made using polarized light reflected microscopy ( prlm ) and depolarized light reflected microscopy ( drlm ) @xcite .",
    "the images were recorded by a ccd camera .",
    "the orientational order parameter @xmath17 @xcite was determined by optical absorption measurements",
    ". at cooling @xmath18 changes from 0.75 to 0.8 in the sm@xmath3 phase , is about 0.82 in sm@xmath0 , and increases up to 0.92 in the hexatic phase .",
    "we performed investigations of thin smectic films starting from thickness of 2  molecular layers .",
    "figure  1 shows the temperatures of the transitions in the films .",
    "similar symbols denote the temperatures of the transitions between the similar structures in the films of different thickness .",
    "the high temperature part of the phase diagram corresponds to the sm@xmath0 structure .",
    "as it was established early @xcite the temperature of the sm@xmath0-sm@xmath3 phase transition in free - standing films is essentially shifted to higher temperature with respect to the bulk samples .",
    "texture of the film is characterized by a smooth spatial variation of the @xmath19-director ( fig .",
    "the picture was taken in the part of the film with a point topological defect , which is typical just for sm@xmath0 phase .",
    "upon cooling of the sm@xmath0 film the first phase transition ( filled circles , transition into the sm@xmath20 state , fig .",
    "1 ) leads to an abrupt change of the film texture ( fig .",
    "in liquid crystalline materials with the bulk hexatic phases the higher temperature transition is associated with the phase transition of the surface layers into the hexatic structure @xcite . in thick films",
    "the high temperature shift of the transition with respect to the phase transition temperature into the hsm@xmath1 structure in the bulk sample is about 9@xmath21c .",
    "this value is approximately the same as for the hsm@xmath1sm@xmath3 transition @xcite .",
    "a different situation is observed for thin films . while for the sm@xmath3 phase the shift of the transition in the 2-layer film with respect to thick films does not exceed @xmath22c , this shift in our case is essentially larger ( more than @xmath23c ) . below the transition",
    "the film consists from domains with different @xmath19-director orientations and sharp boundaries between them ( fig .",
    "such a texture may be expected for tilted hexatic in which the @xmath24-director has a discrete set of orientations and correspondingly sharp boundary between domains .",
    "however , it is not typical for the sm@xmath0 structure , which exists in the interior of the film .",
    "for the films with @xmath25 the view of the films is mainly determined by the sm@xmath0 structure of the film interior .",
    "thus , we conclude that the sm@xmath0 structure inside the film differs sufficiently from the conventional sm@xmath0 structure .",
    "sharp boundary between the domains suggests that not only in the surface layers ( i.e. , in the hexatic state ) but also inside the film ( i.e. , in the sm@xmath0 state ) at the domain boundary the break of the @xmath24-director orientation occurs .",
    "the question arises about the nature of the boundary between domains inside the film .",
    "these peculiarities of the sm@xmath0 structure inside the film become extremely essential after the next transition ( open squares in fig .  1 ) .",
    "at the next transition ( into the sm@xmath26 state , fig .  1 , fig .",
    "3 ) the domains break up into narrow parallel stripes with alternating brightness and sharp boundaries . according to refs .",
    "@xcite at this transition the surface layers transform into a so - called sm@xmath12 phase in which the tilt plane is oriented in the hexatic structure at the angle 15@xmath21 with respect to the direction of the hexatic bond orientation order . in this structure",
    "there are possible 12 equivalent ( i.e. , having the same energy ) orientations of the tilt plane .",
    "our optical measurements confirm that the difference in the @xmath24-director orientation in the neighboring stripes is about 30@xmath21 ( @xmath275@xmath21 ) with two symmetric orientations of the @xmath19-director relative to the stripe boundary @xmath28 ( fig .",
    "the direction of the hexatic bond orientational order does not change across the stripes ( along x - axis ) , while the direction of tilt plane changes at the stripe boundary . inside the film , in the sm@xmath0 structure",
    "there is also a break in the @xmath19-director orientation .",
    "contrary to this , a smooth change of stripe orientation along domains is connected with change of the direction of bond orientation order , meanwhile the orientation of the @xmath19-director relative to the bond orientational order is preserved .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "3a clarifies the periodic stripe structure , in particular in the region of the contact between two stripe domains .",
    "the stripe period increases with decreasing temperature ( fig .  5 ) .",
    "when upon cooling the stripe period achieves the value of about 1315@xmath29 m , the stripe width increases sharply and the structure becomes aperiodic .",
    "open triangles in fig .  1",
    "show the temperatures of this transition .    in the sm@xmath30 region ( fig .",
    "1 ) the film texture may be different ( fig .  3b , c and fig .",
    "6a ) and in many aspects is similar to the observed earlier in films of sm@xmath0 material with hexatic phases @xcite .",
    "however the transition temperatures between different textures are hardly reproducible . moreover the low temperature texture ( fig .",
    "6a ) as a rule transforms at heating directly into the state with periodic stripes ( fig .",
    "3a ) . due to this reason in the phase diagram ( fig .",
    "1 ) we point only the transition temperature between periodic stripe and aperiodic structures ( open triangles in fig .  1 ) .",
    "the domain structure , shown in fig .",
    "3b , is formed on cooling from the narrow periodic stripes through their broadening .",
    "this picture ( fig .",
    "3b ) was obtained by means of depolarized light reflection microscopy .",
    "the domain boundaries with the same brightness are oriented at about 45@xmath21 with respect to the polarizers .",
    "it manifests that orientations of the @xmath19-director in the neighboring domains are symmetric with respect to the domain boundary .",
    "measurements with crossed polarizes prove that the @xmath24-director in domains is oriented at the angles @xmath2715@xmath21 with respect to the domain boundary .",
    "therefore , the structure of wide domains ( fig .",
    "3b ) is similar to the narrow periodic stripes ( fig .",
    "3a ) . the honeycomb texture ( fig .",
    "3c ) forms from the line domains ( fig .",
    "3a ) and exists only in a small temperature range ( @xmath31c ) .",
    "more typical textures in the sm@xmath30 state are domains with continuous change of the @xmath24-director orientation across the domains ( upper part of fig .",
    "6a ) or large domains ( lower part of fig .",
    "6a ) also with a continuous variation of the @xmath19-director orientation . in thin films",
    "this structure can be cooled to low temperatures ( @xmath32c ) . in thick films ( @xmath33 )",
    "a reversible phase transition is observed with formation of the texture shown in fig .",
    "this texture is typical for the tilted sm@xmath10 phase . in the limit of very thick films ( @xmath34 ) crossed domains",
    "may be formed ( fig .",
    "6b ) below the surface phase transition temperature .",
    "two independent sets of domains are formed at both film surfaces .",
    "formation of these independent structures in the thick films may point that surface correlation length @xmath35 is less than about 50 smectic interlayer periods .",
    "in order to provide a more complete account of the phenomena described in the previous section , it would seem appropriate to discuss how the observed results can be consistently modeled theoretically . without prior knowledge of the actual structure , we shall assume the simplest model to answer the natural questions why the phase transitions in materials with sm@xmath3 and sm@xmath0 phases are so different , and what kind of mechanisms are responsible for the formation of the periodic stripe structure and its temperature dependence . from our experimental observations a few conclusions about the following qualitative features of the film structures and their transformations seem inescapable .",
    "first , formation of the periodic stripes ( fig .",
    "3a ) is related to the structure of the surface layers . in the higher temperature sm@xmath20 state",
    "the @xmath19-director is oriented along one direction ( fig .",
    "4a ) in the middle between apexes of the sm@xmath10 phase hexagon . in the sm@xmath12 phase the energy minimum splits and",
    "the @xmath19-director may orient in two directions @xcite corresponding to two equivalent energy minima ( @xmath2715@xmath21 with respect to the initial orientation , fig .",
    "as it is known competing attractive and repulsive interactions generate domain patterns in a wide variety of systems @xcite .",
    "formation of a periodic structure is a signature of instability that arises from a competition between two antagonistic fields , and that , above some threshold , a modulated state has a lower energy than the uniform one . in liquid crystals",
    "this scenario is often related with existence of electric polarization and a certain competition between the long - range forces ( namely electric and elastic ones ) . in the thin film under consideration",
    ", the electric polarization may appear due to nonuniform profile of the order parameter induced by the film surface and also because the surface layers are in the hexatic phase .",
    "this polarization @xmath36 is longitudinal ( i.e. , parallel to the tilt plane ) and points in opposite directions in the upper and lower parts of the film @xcite . these interactions ( electrostatic and elastic ) contribute differently into the energy of alternative configurations associated with existence of the domain walls , and may lead to stabilization of the equilibrium stripe period ( as in solid crystal ferroelectric domains ) .    in liquid crystal films with the broken polar symmetry",
    "there is also another cause of the stripe formation @xcite .",
    "indeed , the broken polar symmetry allows linear over space gradients terms into the landau type free energy expansion .",
    "these terms affect the elastic constants , which even may tend to zero .",
    "in this situation the free energy of the defect structure may become more favorable than the uniform structure .",
    "thus the uniformly ordered state becomes unstable with respect to the striped phase with periodic domain walls .",
    "the equilibrium modulated structure arises to optimize the gain in the elastic energy of the orientational deformation inside the stripes and the energy cost to have the defect .    in literature devoted to theoretical descriptions of the modulated phases in smectic films mostly models for polar smectic liquid crystal films with transverse polarization",
    "are discussed @xcite .",
    "apparently it is not the case for our system .",
    "there are several distinctions between the stripes shown in fig .",
    "3a ( see also their schematic representation in fig .",
    "4b , c ) and periodic stripes discussed in @xcite .",
    "first , in our case the structure of the surface layers is hexatic and it dictates the value of director jump at the domain boundary .",
    "second , the neighboring stripes found in the works @xcite have identical structures , whereas in our case the azimuthal molecular orientation in the adjacent stripes differs : @xmath19-director is rotated clockwise with respect to the symmetric orientation in the left stripe ( fig .",
    "4b , c ) and counterclockwise in the right stripe ( fig .",
    "4b , c ) . next ,",
    "inside the stripes investigated in @xcite elastic deformation is of the bend type with the same sign of the bend in all stripes and with defect walls in which the @xmath19-director jumps back . in our case",
    "the reorientation of the @xmath19-director between stripes is of the splay type .",
    "moreover , there is no visible orientational deformation of the @xmath19-director inside stripes ( fig .",
    "thus care must be taken when comparing published theoretical results to our experimental data .",
    "below we examine one important aspect of the liquid crystal modulated phase formation which does not appear to have been investigated in any generality .    in our opinion ,",
    "unusual structure of the stripes we have observed is related to the nature of the geometrical frustration in the films formed by non - chiral material .",
    "it was recognized quite some time ago that because of the up - down asymmetry , the achiral smectic film exhibits polar properties , in particular the @xmath24-director may be considered as a true vector ( i.e. , @xmath37 and @xmath38 states are not equivalent ) . in ferroelectric sm@xmath39 phases",
    "the chiral asymmetry favors a bend ( @xmath40 ) in the @xmath19-director @xmath41 . the preferred bend direction ( the sign of the coefficient @xmath42 at the linear over space derivatives term ) is determined by handedness of the material ( or by the direction of the ferroelectric polarization ) which is the same in the whole film .",
    "we argue below , that in achiral systems the instability arises from a competition between two elastic energies , the usual quadratic frank elastic energy , which favors a uniform orientation of the @xmath37-director , and an additional surface elastic term linear in @xmath37 gradient which promotes spontaneous splay distortions .",
    "the linear over gradients terms like @xmath43 are not allowed by the symmetry . however , in such a film the broken chiral symmetry occurs as a result of asymmetry between the surfaces ( possessing hexatic ordering ) and the interior of the film ( which is in the sm@xmath0 state ) .",
    "our measurements show that not only the tilt angle but even the orientational order parameter @xmath18 differs essentially in sm@xmath0 and hexatic structures .",
    "the surface - induced term linear over the gradients of * c * ( @xmath44 ) favors a splay deformation ( @xmath45 ) in the * c * field and has the opposite signs ( direction of splay curvature ) in the top and bottom parts of the film @xcite .",
    "the @xmath37-director is also the order parameter of the film .",
    "it allows one to describe its macroscopic physics , in particular , to write its free energy in the spirit of the landau theory @xmath46 the first two terms are the splay and bend elastic energies , and frank elastic moduli @xmath47 and @xmath48 are proportional to the film thickness .",
    "the last two terms are conventional landau expansion .",
    "the third term @xmath49 is a total derivative that can be transformed to boundary terms .",
    "therefore it is relevant only for the thin films . for the thick films another term with the same symmetry",
    "can be constructed @xmath50 and to avoid its reduction to the pure surface contribution , variations in the @xmath19 amplitude are needed .",
    "these kinds of the contributions into the free energy ( terms linear over the splay distortion @xmath51 ) lead to formation of the unusual modulated structure we have observed in this work .",
    "if the molecules forming the system carried permanent dipole moments with a non - vanishing component along the direction @xmath19 , then the phase would exhibit spontaneous electric polarization @xmath52 .",
    "this spontaneous polarization is proportional to the polar order parameter .",
    "for simplicity and for the lack of different compelling indications from the experimental part of our work , the dipolar forces will be neglected in the stripe period estimation below .",
    "it might be the case if the molecules involved have relatively large shape anisotropy ( and not a large electric dipole moment ) , and ionic impurities screen the coulomb interaction .",
    "however , it is not the whole story . in order to get the correct structure of the splay phase",
    ", one has to take into account the complete order parameter , including the modulus @xmath53 .",
    "besides , there is a price to be paid , because @xmath53 can not be constant , where the splay is constant .",
    "indeed , in 2d the splay distortion of the orientation can not occur in a defect - free fashion . instead , to relieve this frustration ,",
    "the system will form a modulated phase consisting of a regular network of defect walls and points .",
    "it is interesting and tempting to hypothesize the following stripe structure satisfying such kind of the symmetry breaking .",
    "the uniform sm@xmath0 structure of the top part of the film breaks up into finite regions with splay deformation of the @xmath19-director ( fig .",
    "regions with the same favorable sign of the splay ( counterclockwise in fig .",
    "4d ) are separated by defect lines in which the @xmath19-director abruptly rotates back . in the bottom part of the film ( fig .",
    "4e ) the @xmath19-director rotation is the opposite ( clockwise ) .",
    "the lines in which the @xmath24-director jumps back are shifted in the x - direction on the stripe period @xmath54 with respect to the top part of the film ( fig .  4d , e ) .",
    "in this structure the direction of the splay modulation in * c * is favorable on the both sides of the film .",
    "remarkably the net magnitude of the @xmath19-director orientation @xmath55 across the film is constant in each stripe in the agreement with our experimental data .",
    "their values @xmath56 are dictated by structure of the surface sm@xmath12 phase .",
    "to be stable a splay modulated structure has to overcome the unfavorable core defect energy ( @xmath57 ) and the ordinary nematic order parameter contribution . in the zero approximation",
    "the periodic stripe phase exists when the gain in the surface - elasticity energy exceeds the energy @xmath58 of the domain wall .",
    "competition between these energies determines the stripe width @xcite : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the mean frank constant . in the temperature window @xmath61",
    "( @xmath6 is the bulk sm@xmath0hsm@xmath1 transition temperature ) we are interested in , the main temperature dependent factor in ( [ width ] ) is @xmath62 .",
    "the very existence of this linear splay distortion is due to the asymmetry of the order parameter profile over the film .",
    "induced by the surface ordering @xmath63 , hexatic ( bond ) order parameter @xmath64 decays toward the interior of the film @xmath65}{\\cosh ( l/\\xi ) } \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the film thickness , and @xmath66 is the bulk phase transition correlation length @xmath67 with @xmath68 designating the bare microscopic correlation length .",
    "the asymmetry of the profile @xmath64 determines the value of the parameter @xmath62 @xmath69 and the transition from the homogeneous to the modulated phase occurs if the asymmetry is strong enough ( see , ( [ width ] ) ) .",
    "thus we end up with the conclusion that the stripe phase ( soliton regime ) appears spontaneously on cooling and then the period of the distortion increases with decreasing temperature . the second conclusion from ( [ width ] ) is that upon cooling when @xmath62 exceeds @xmath57 , the periodic stripe structure becomes unstable .",
    "the both conclusions conform to our experimental observations .",
    "we observe complex phase behavior with various equilibrium structures . a separate question how to calculate all equilibrium structures of a specific system ,",
    "requires full minimization of the global free energy , and it depends on unknown phenomenological landau expansion coefficients .",
    "we will not even attempt the calculation of such a complex phase diagram in this paper but will content ourselves with one remark .",
    "modulated phases we found have nonuniform density or orientation distributions , that is to say their symmetry is that of a solid or a liquid crystal .",
    "the difference between the phases which appear under the name of modulated structures , and solids or liquid crystals , is that generally the period of modulation is larger .",
    "it is not a major goal of this work to achieve quantitative agreement between the results obtained with our phenomenological model and experimental measurements .",
    "however , since the present understanding of the mechanism leading to modulated structures in achiral tilted hexatic films is incomplete , the model may be an appropriate tool for working out typical trends that may be testable in experiments . in this paper",
    "we have presented results of studies of structural transformations in thin liquid crystal films with the smectic-@xmath0 ( sm@xmath0 ) to hexatic ( hsm@xmath1 ) phase transition , and their interpretation within a simple phenomenological model .",
    "the free energy was written in the most simple form that involves the least number of model parameters , and we have shown that this simple model can capture many of the features seen in experiment .",
    "our interpretation of the results is based on the simple consideration that because of the up - down asymmetry , the achiral smectic film exhibits polar properties . one note of caution is in order here .",
    "in fact the structure of any sm@xmath0 phase is inherently polar since the tilt singles out a unique direction about the layer normal ( although , the directors @xmath70 and @xmath71 are physically indistinguishable ) . therefore in the sm@xmath0 structure",
    "one may have a pseudo - vector @xmath72 obviously @xmath73 is perpendicular to the tilt plane , and this kind of the polarity ( along the pseudo - vector @xmath73 ) is of fundamentally different nature from the polarity along @xmath19 we investigated in our paper .",
    "indeed , @xmath73 polarity is compatible with mirror symmetry in the tilt plane , whereas the polar splay distortion responsible for the stripe structure , changes its sign under such a mirror reflection .",
    "a question of primary importance is the understanding of the origin of the thermodynamic behavior we found in our work .",
    "it is well known @xcite that for a film with the uniform ordering ( like nematic or ferromagnetic ) , when the interaction at the boundaries is such that it enhances local order , it may happen that a surface transition takes place at temperatures above the critical temperature of the bulk .",
    "in such a transition , the layers close to the surface become ordered although the bulk remains disordered .",
    "depending on the nature of the interactions between the bulk and the surface , the system may exhibit various surface phase transitions , for instance , wetting transitions . in the latter case at temperatures just below the bulk transition",
    ", the thickness of the surface ordered layer is infinite . unlike this scenario , non - uniformly ordered ( modulated ) systems not necessarily exhibit wetting phenomena , in which the thickness of surface ordered layer diverges . instead of it ,",
    "the system might exhibit a transition from one surface state to another , where both surface states have a finite thickness @xcite .",
    "since we have to deal in this work with modulated ( non - uniform ) structures , aforesaid arguments provide the physically appealing thermodynamic interpretation of our results .",
    "first of all since we have deal with films , the basic thermodynamics of phase transitions should be formulated for this kind of the restricted geometry .",
    "such a problem has been discussed for various systems long ago , and the results borrowed from the textbooks @xcite read as follows . in a film of thickness @xmath12 ,",
    "the thermodynamic potential @xmath74 per unit area is @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the surface free energy , @xmath77 is the bulk pressure , and @xmath3 is the area .",
    "we denote the surface free energies of the smectic @xmath0 and hexatic phases by @xmath78 , and @xmath79 respectively , and the laplace condition yields @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the contact angle between sm@xmath0 and hexatic , and @xmath82 is the surface energy at the interface . in the bulk the coexistence temperature @xmath6 is defined by the equilibrium condition @xmath83 in the finite thickness @xmath12 film @xmath84 and from @xmath85 one finds @xmath86 since @xmath87 ( @xmath88 is the entropy ) we get @xmath89 and @xmath90 is the latent heat at the bulk transition .",
    "the same can be expressed ( see ( [ d2 ] ) ) as @xmath91 however , in ( [ d7 ] ) we did not consider the interaction @xmath92 @xcite between the film surfaces ( or between the walls ) . repeating the same thermodynamics as above , one ends up with the same kind of the equation but where the disjoining pressure @xmath93 @xcite renormalizes the surface energy @xmath76 @xmath94 according to ( [ d8 ] ) when the contact angle @xmath95 , the hsm@xmath1 phase is favored near the boundary , when @xmath96 , the sm@xmath0 phase is favored , and the intermediate values of @xmath97 apply to intermediate structures . in any case for the finite film thickness there are two possible scenarios depending on the film thickness . in one scenario the phase transition will occur before the surface hsm@xmath1 layer has had a chance to grow thick . in the another scenario , one can have a phase transition at a temperature at which hsm@xmath1 thickness at the surface is already larger than the sample thickness @xmath12 .",
    "there are clearly several open questions and future challenges .",
    "one of them is related to dipolar forces . indeed ,",
    "since the molecules are tilted , and the interface and the interior symmetry of the film are different from each other , the film has only one symmetry element , the vertical mirror plane , which is perpendicular to the film and parallel to the molecules .",
    "the film is therefore equivalent to a two - dimensional polar nematic , and it bears an electric polarization",
    ". if this polarization is small compared to the elastic energies involved , our arguments given above apply . on the other hand , if electric energies dominate , another kind of the texture can be stable , since all splay centers act as charge centers , and in this case a lattice of several small charges is more stable than one big charge .",
    "another interesting question is how to tune parameters of the various modulated structures to optimize properties of technological interest .",
    "for instance , a wide area of research is clearly the problem to what extent the investigated systems can be useful to achieve interesting electro - optical properties .",
    "the treatment above can be generalized to more realistic systems ( e.g. dipolar forces including ) , with the same conceptual ingredients , albeit at the expense of a rapidly increasing complexity .",
