    "the close relationship between thermionic and thermoelectric devices has been analysed by a number of authors @xcite . in this paper , this comparison is extended to similarities between the dependence of the electronic efficiencies of these devices on the details of the electron energy spectrum .",

    "narrower electron energy filters and , more significantly , a sharp rise in the transmission probability from zero to complete transmission give dramatic improvements in electronic efficiency . using a numerical model of ballistic transport in semiconductor hetrostructures ,",
    "we show that sharply - rising transmission probabilities yielding high electronic efficiency and power may be achieved with wide single barrier and multibarrier devices .",
    "finally , the equivalence of the ballistic and diffusive formalisms for devices with length the order of the electron mean free path @xcite means that in this regime , the electronic efficiency of thermionic and thermoelectric devices will have the same dependence upon the details of the electron energy spectrum .",
    "a thermionic device consists of two electron reservoirs at different temperatures and electrochemical potentials , separated by a barrier , or series of barriers , which limit the flow of electrons between them to a certain energy range . whether the device operates as a power generator , pumping high - energy electrons from the hot to the cold against the electrical potential difference , or as a refrigerator , removing high - energy electrons from the cold reservoir , depends upon the relative magnitudes of the opposing temperature and electrochemical potentials .    in a @xmath0-filtered thermionic device , where the transmission probability , @xmath9 , is a function of the total electron energy , @xmath10 ,",

    "we have assumed that electron velocity is determined by the reservoirs .",
    "a more detailed theory would be required to account for any velocity changes due to the device structure .",
    "one may calculate the heat flux out of the hot and cold reservoirs by noting that an electron leaving or entering the cold / hot reservoir will remove or add respectively an amount of heat equal to the difference between the energy of the electron and the average energy of electrons in the reservoir , that is @xmath18 . introducing this factor inside the integral for number current",

    "this difference is due to the fact that , while the barrier system filters electrons according to their momentum in the direction of transport , their momenta in the other two dimensions may take any value , contributing on average an extra @xmath27 to the energy of electrons emitted from the cold / hot reservoir . the heat flux out of the cold / hot reservoir in a @xmath8 filtered device is therefore given by @xmath28 \\zeta(e_{x } ) de.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it",

    "thus , the term @xmath47 in the diffusive formalism plays the same role as @xmath48 in the ballistic formalism .",
    "we therefore expect the dependencies of the electron energy spectrum in both thermionic and thermoelectric device to be similar .",
    "since @xmath49 and @xmath50 are fixed by the reservoirs , at fixed temperature / chemical potential the electron energy spectrum in a ballistic device is determined by the transmission probability as device structure varies . in a diffusive device ,",
    "both @xmath33 and @xmath51 may change when the device structure is altered and affect the energy spectrum .",

    ", there are two different quasi - static limits in which this requirement is satisfied .",
    "the first way is to restrict the flow of electrons to those with energies approaching infinity where the occupation of states tends to zero .",
    "this may be achieved , for instance , with an intrinsic semiconductor where the band gap approaches infinity in a thermoelectric device or an infinitely high barrier system in a thermionic device . in vacuum",
    "thermionic devices operating at very high temperatures ( @xmath53 k ) , optimim efficiency is approached when the barrier height is almost 20 times larger than @xmath54 @xcite , meaning that electronic efficiencies close to the carnot limit may be obtained . however , at the more moderate emitter temperatures , 300 k @xmath55 k , of interest in most applications , achieving finite power production or refrigeration via a thermionic device requires a much lower barrier height , of the order of a few @xmath54 .",
    "it is therefore more practical to utilize the other quasi - static limit to achieve high electronic efficiencies .",
    "the second way to achieve reversibility in a thermionic or thermoelectric device , which we refer to as energy - specific equilibrium , is to allow electrons to flow only at a single energy where the fermi occupation of states throughout the device is the same @xcite , @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the temperature and chemical potential changes respectively over a distance @xmath59 in the device . at this energy , the effect , or , in the language of irreversible thermodynamics ,",

    "such devices consist of alternating semiconductor layers with barrier and well widths chosen such that energy levels in the wells are closely aligned under bias .",

    "relatively narrow energy electron emission peaks from carbon nanotubes have been reported which may be of use in a vacuum based device @xcite . since the dos in the reservoirs fixes the number of electrons available for transport in a certain energy range in ballistic devices , the reduction of power in narrow transmission probability devices , with only modest gains in electronic efficiency ,",
    "is expected to be undesirable in the presence phonon heat leaks .",
    "it is likely that the best way to simultaneously achieve high electronic efficiency and high power in a ballistic device is to design the structure such that the transmission probability rises sharply from zero to one and remains close to unity beyond this . whilst the most obvious way to achieve a transmission probability of this nature is to utilise a single barrier with a width as large possible ( but",
    "less than the mean free path of electrons ) here we show that an array of thin barriers can also be used to engineer a transmission probability that rises sharply from zero to unity .",
