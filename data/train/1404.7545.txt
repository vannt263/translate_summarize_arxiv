    "we now expand the cosine in terms of the scalar fields to second order , valid for large @xmath29 ( deep in ising phase ) where @xmath97 has small fluctuations about a value that minimizes the cosine term . after dropping an overall constant ,",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath98 plugging in the following mode expansions ( ignoring zero modes ) for @xmath97 and @xmath99    @xmath100    the hamiltonian takes the form @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 we can diagonalize @xmath104 via a bogoliubov transformation @xmath105 with    @xmath106    this yields the diagonal bilinear form @xmath107 the ground state @xmath108 of @xmath104 is specified by the condition that @xmath109 @xmath110 @xmath111 . from this , we can calculate the entanglement hamiltonian using free field theory methods @xcite .",

    "in this section , we prove the effect of certain real - space symmetries on the momentum space es .  for @xmath28 , one can unitarily transform the hamiltonian from negative @xmath77 to positive @xmath77 by a @xmath78 rotation about the @xmath79 axis on every second site .",
    "this provides a relationship between the real - space wave - functions for positive and negative @xmath77 .",
    "this relationship is given by @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the ground state coefficient of a given spin configuration for the case when @xmath77 is positive , @xmath126 is the ground state coefficient of a given spin configuration when @xmath77 is negative , @xmath127 is the location of the @xmath128th down spin and @xmath129 is the total number of down spins .",

    "the momentum space coefficients @xcite for negative @xmath77 are given by @xmath130 we see that we now have an effective momentum which appears in the fourier transform .",
    "the effective momentum for each spin - flip is @xmath131 .    to see how this affects the es , we first write the ground state wave function in a schmidt decomposition of a fixed number of left and right moving particles as @xmath132 where @xmath133 and @xmath134 represent all possible occupation states that give rise to a subsystem with left movers with total momentum @xmath135 and right movers with total momentum @xmath111 , and the sum over @xmath128 represents the sum over all possible momentum sectors . using the approximation that @xmath136 we arrive at the reduced density matrix for negative @xmath77 @xmath137 substituting eq . into eq .",

    "here we have used the fact that most of the weight is in the @xmath139 sector for the positive case which allows us to collapse the sum over momentum sectors .",
    "thus , we see that the entanglement levels for negative @xmath77 are the same as positive @xmath77 , but appear at momenta shifted by @xmath140 .",
    "this completes the proof for the reflection observed in figures  [ @xmath141 and  [ @xmath142 .",

    "we are in a dimerized phase . as a consequence , for an even number of sites",

    "in addition to the total spin of the system being zero , the total spin of each sub - system is zero for the ground state .",
    "this fact is crucial to this proof .",
    "one can write the real - space wave - function as @xmath146 where the primes indicate the sum over the odd sites and the unprimed @xmath147 s are on even sites .",
    "the coefficients of the fourier transform are given by      taking @xmath33 to @xmath149 on even sites simply returns a factor of @xmath150 .",
    "doing this for the odd sites returns a factor of @xmath151 .",
    "however , because we have a fixed number of down spins on the odd sites , this factor is the same for every term in the sum and just returns an overall phase . in this case",
    "it is unity , since there are a even number of down spins on the odd sites .",
    "thus the momentum space wave - function is invariant under @xmath152 .",
    "we have seen earlier this leads to a reflection in the entanglement spectrum about a certain @xmath65 and thus explains the observed reflection in the entanglement spectrum for @xmath144 ( fig .",

    "<S> we obtain a linear , _ i.e. _ volume scaling for the ee , different from the standard area law seen in real space systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( this volume scaling hints at a drawback of momentum space dmrg from the view of general information theory . </S>",
    "<S> still , the structure of the es might render this formulation advantageous in the end , for the range of finite systems which are available . ) by varying @xmath11 and expanding the ee in the large @xmath38 limit around @xmath70 , we find @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior at @xmath12 is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ flat ] .    </S>",
    "<S> despite similarity in state counting to the laughlin es on the quantum hall sphere , one important difference is that the es at the heisenberg point is flat , consistent with the heisenberg point being non - chiral . </S>",
    "<S> ( note the es of the fqh laughlin state on the sphere mimics a linearly dispersing chiral @xmath72 mode in the conformal limit @xcite . ) </S>",
    "<S> an important consequence of the flat spectrum at the heisenberg point is the absence of tee , which we have numerically confirmed , whereas the fqh laughlin state on the sphere has tee @xcite .    * </S>",
    "<S> _ bosonic entanglement gap _ *  we now vary @xmath29 and investigate the behavior of the eg . adjusting @xmath29 varies the scaling dimension of the underlying cft in the gapless phase . as stated before </S>",
    "<S> , the eg is infinite at the hs point ( which can be thought of as an @xmath30 invariant deformation away from the heisenberg point ) , at which the fractionalized excitations , spinons , are free and interact only through their mutual statistics . </S>",
    "<S> moving from the hs point to the heisenberg point introduces interactions between spinons and dresses the state , but the eg still remains in the td limit . </S>",
    "<S> the eg for bosons is defined as the minimal difference between the generic entanglement levels and the low lying universal levels . </S>",
    "<S> our conclusions do not depend on whether we define the eg as a direct gap constrained to a given sector @xmath73 or as a global gap over all @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the eg for bosons is not open throughout the entire gapless region . </S>",
    "<S> this is not affected by considering an approximate decomposition in total momentum or an exact decomposition in crystal momentum .    </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ boson_es_22 ] shows representative plots of the bosonic es as a function of @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> the eg decreases as @xmath29 is lowered from @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively , this is due to interactions developing between spinons , which further dress the approximate product - like spinon state present at the heisenberg point . </S>",
    "<S> the eg for 22 sites closes at @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> finite size scaling suggests that in the td limit the eg closes at @xmath76 ( fig .  [ gap ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the exact location of the closure is beyond the scope of present work . </S>",
    "<S> the important feature is the closure of the eg for some value of @xmath29 in the gapless regime . </S>",
    "<S> this is seen _ even _ for finite system sizes . </S>",
    "<S> it might allow for the interpretation that the momentum space eg is not , by itself , a necessary signature for a gapless s=1/2 spin fluid state .    </S>",
    "<S> note real space symmetries also yield fingerprints in the momentum space es for bosons . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath28 , one can unitarily transform the hamiltonian from negative @xmath77 to positive @xmath77 by a @xmath78 rotation about the @xmath79 axis on every second site . </S>",
    "<S> we analytically show in the supplemental material this leads to a shift in momentum by half a lattice vector and a reflection in the es . </S>",
    "<S> we also prove a reflection seen in the bosonic es when @xmath80 .    * </S>",
    "<S> _ fermionic es _ *     fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fermion_es ] shows plots of the fermionic es for representative values of @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> we first observe that the counting of 1,1,2,3,5 ... for all values of @xmath29 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fermion_es ] ) , starting from @xmath81 , is trivial , as it links to total hilbert space state counting in the respective momentum sector . </S>",
    "<S> this highlights the importance of the @xmath72 counting seen for bosons near @xmath12 where the hilbert space is not exhausted by this counting .    at @xmath28 , </S>",
    "<S> the fermionic left and right movers are not entangled and form a product state @xcite with an infinite eg . </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively the gap decreases as we increase @xmath29 from zero due to interactions developing between fermions , complementary to what is observed for bosons . </S>",
    "<S> the eg captures the low energy properties of @xmath7 , thus phase transitions in @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ gap ] shows the td projection of the fermionic eg . </S>",
    "<S> the eg remains relatively large and finite well past @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ gap ] shows that the scaling with inverse system size always decays linearly and the gap remains open in the td limit past @xmath12 . for @xmath82 , the system sizes we consider are larger than the correlation length @xcite , so we expect our scaling to be reliable . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the correlation length for the charge stiffness , taken from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , is @xmath83 lattice spacings for @xmath84 , while the largest system size we consider is 10 times bigger ( dividing @xmath15 by two due to pbcs ) . </S>",
    "<S> this should also be compared to the scaling difference between the two lowest physical energy levels . analyzing the scaling of the difference in the two lowest physical energy levels in the @xmath0 model </S>",
    "<S> , one can accurately detect the phase transition at @xmath12 with only ten sites @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as such , the system sizes considered here are large enough in principle to detect phase transitions near the td value . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the eg and the es systematically do not capture the phase transition from the gapless to gapped phase .    </S>",
    "<S> the es deep in the ising phase is linear as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fermions_seven ] @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this adds to the argument that the eg extends past @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the reasoning is as follows : starting near the transition ( on the gapped side ) of @xmath7 ( at zero entanglement temperature , @xmath85 ) we can imagine increasing @xmath85 . increasing @xmath85 , we expect the gapped phase to become gapless due to thermal fluctuations , thus giving us the required physical phase diagram at @xmath86 @xcite .    * _ conclusions _ *  we have studied the momentum space es for both bosons and fermions . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown with analytical methods and exact diagonalization the momentum space es fails to detect physical phase transitions . </S>",
    "<S> more explicitly , the eg seen for bosons @xcite _ does not _ </S>",
    "<S> remain open for arbitrary scaling dimensions in the @xmath27 cft domain . for fermions </S>",
    "<S> , we found that the low energy ( highly entangled ) part of @xmath7 does not host a phase transition near a corresponding physical phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> our findings for fermions suggest the results of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which state that momentum space es can characterize disordered one - dimensional fermionic systems , need to be taken with caution in the presence of interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> our results are useful for numerical techniques such as dmrg , where one discards states of @xmath4 with low entanglement . for both fermions and bosons , </S>",
    "<S> a large separation of scales in entanglement persists in a relatively large region around the phase transition at @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> assuming there is still enough entanglement weight located below the eg , this might , despite a volume law for ee , allow a momentum space based dmrg code to probe the critical point and the region around it . </S>",
    "<S> this work highlights that the non - universality of the es pointed out in ref .  </S>",
