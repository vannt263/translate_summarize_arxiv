    "most notably we see the continued emergence of pulsons on the `` upwind '' side of the initial distribution , leading to the emergence of a pulson at the top center of the contour plot in figure [ iv_g_to_ps2_fig ] .",
    "figures [ iv_g_to_cs2_fig ] and [ iv_g_to_g_fig ] also depict this phenomenon of curvature in the space - time trajectories during the emergence of the @xmath175 compactons and gaussons . in figure [ iv_g_to_cs2_fig ]",
    "the curvature in the space - time trajectories is not only because of the prolonged interaction between the @xmath175 compactons , but also because of their interaction with the residual initial distribution as they recross the domain .",
    "we do not show the gaussons emerging from the initial @xmath169 compacton shape and colliding with the initial residual distribution in figure [ iv_cs1_to_g_fig ] because there are too many pulses to make a clear plot .",
    "however , this figure helps to support our main conclusion : that an arbitrary ( even ) wave form given by the green s function @xmath10 can be made to emerge from an ( essentially ) arbitrary confined initial condition . in this case",
    "we have chosen a wide @xmath169 compacton for the initial distribution partly because its shallow discontinuity imposes less stringent conditions on the numerics , and also to demonstrate the effects that the width of the initial condition has on the number of emergent pulses .",
    "namely , the width of the initial distribution must be greater than the single pulson width prescribed by the function @xmath10 , and wider initial distributions produce a larger number of pulsons .    in summary , figures [ iv_g_to_ps2_fig ] , [ iv_g_to_cs2_fig ] , [ iv_g_to_g_fig ] and [ iv_cs1_to_g_fig ]",
    "demonstrate that : ( 1 ) the shape of each wave form emerging in the initial value problem is controlled by the choice of @xmath10 ; and ( 2 ) the dynamical behavior of the emergent pulses is qualitatively the same as the integrable behavior of the peakons and @xmath169 compactons .",
    "we compute the evolution governed by equation ( [ epeqn ] ) with two wave forms ( for a particular choice of green s function ) located initially at @xmath187 and @xmath188 with amplitudes @xmath189 and @xmath190 , respectively .",
    "this situation is arranged to investigate the nature of rear - end collisions both for the integrable and nonintegrable cases . beginning with the integrable cases depicted in figures [ rear_puls_s1_fig ] and [ rear_comp_s1_fig ] , we see that , consistent with the findings of  @xcite , the slower peakon in figure [ rear_puls_s1_fig ] experiences no phase shift , but the faster peakon experiences a shift to the right .",
    "this occurs after each collision , thus causing the second collision to occur to the left of the first . in figure [ rear_comp_s1_fig ]",
    "we see that the faster @xmath169 compacton trajectory experiences a phase shift to the right while the slower one experiences a shift to the left . thus , perhaps not unexpectedly , the phase shift of the interaction depends on the pulse shape .",
    "the sudden leftward phase shift of the slower trajectory indicates that momentum is being transferred rightward rather quickly in the collision process across the entire width of both wave forms .",
    "this is something like the sudden transfer of momentum in the collision of billiard balls .",
    "for this reason , the magnitude of the phase shift increases with pulse width .",
    "note that the pulsons exchange momentum in each collision , rather than passing through each other .",
    "the nonintegrable cases depicted in figures [ rear_puls_s2_fig ] , [ rear_comp_s2_fig ] , [ rear_gaus_fig ] , and [ rear_multi_fig ] all show similar elastic collisions resulting only in phase shifts . in each case",
    "the faster pulse trajectory experiences no shift , or a shift to the right , while the slower one experiences a shift to the left .",
    "the magnitude of the shift increases with pulse width .",
    "the pulse width is the largest for the multicompactons in figure [ rear_multi_fig ] and they experience the largest phase shift of the four nonintegrable cases shown here . the gaussons in figure [ rear_gaus_fig ] , on the other hand , experience the least phase shift and they are the narrowest of the four nonintegrable pulsons we treat .",

    "the complexity of the wave shapes and the strengths of the various singularities which form according to equation ( [ vel_collide_eqn ] ) during these interactions for many choices of pulson shapes are beyond the capabilities of most numerics .",
    "for example , the spatial derivative of equation ( [ vel_collide_eqn ] ) at @xmath192 gives @xmath193 hence , whether a vertical slope in @xmath8 forms at @xmath192 depends on the choice of the green s function @xmath10 .",
    "colliding peakon - antipeakon profiles are depicted in figure [ col_puls_s1_fig ] .",
    "as discussed in  @xcite the solution @xmath8 in this case tends to zero as @xmath194 , as the slope @xmath195 diverges to minus infinity .",
    "also , @xmath196 as @xmath197 , so as to maintain constant energy and zero total momentum in the particle system .",
    "this divergence phenomenon occurs similarly for the @xmath169 compactons , as shown in figure [ col_comp_s1_fig ] .    as with the peakons ,",
    "the colliding @xmath169 compactons develop a vertical slope in velocity at @xmath192 when @xmath198 . upon making initial contact when @xmath199",
    ", the two triangular pulses develop a maximum negative slope at @xmath192 of @xmath200 } = -2c$ ] which remains constant until @xmath201 , whereupon the two pulses begin to clip their peaks and become trapezoidal as the slope at @xmath192 tends toward minus infinity via @xmath202 , cf .",
    "equation ( [ ux_x0eqn ] ) .",
    "when @xmath203 , the two colliding pulses diminish to @xmath204 and then `` bounce '' apart to reverse the aformentioned process , so that @xmath205 until @xmath201 with @xmath200 } = + 2c$ ] .",
    "thereafter , the reformed pulses separate in opposite directions . note that @xmath125 approaches zero , but does not change sign ; so the `` particles '' with phase space coordinates @xmath206 , @xmath92 , @xmath207 , keep their order , just as for the rear - end collisions .",
    "the most significant difference between the integrable and nonintegrable pulson - antipulson collisions is that the solution @xmath191 does not necessarily tend toward zero as @xmath194 for the nonintegrable cases .",
    "another difference is that a verticality in slope does not necessarily develop at @xmath192 .",
    "moreover , such a verticality may not develop at all .",
    "as an example of a nonintegrable pulse that does not approach @xmath204 as @xmath208 , but does develop _ two _ verticalities at that instant , we consider a parabolic pulse such that @xmath209 the antisymmetrically colliding parabolas are shown in figure [ col_parab_fig ] . as the parabolic pulson collides with its antipulson , two verticalities develop at @xmath210 rather than at @xmath192 . by equation ( [ vel_collide_eqn ] ) , this interaction creates a limiting distribution such that @xmath211    as an example of a nonintegrable pulson that does not tend toward @xmath204 and develops no verticalities in slope as @xmath194 , we consider the antisymmetrically colliding gaussons depicted in figure [ col_gaus_fig ] . here",
    "the limiting distribution is @xmath212 when an antisymmetric collision results in a limiting distribution as in equations ( [ limit_parab_eqn ] ) and ( [ limit_gaus_eqn ] ) as @xmath213 , the solutions must flip instantaneously as they approach @xmath214 , and bounce apart so that the post - collision interaction will be identical but opposite in polarity to the pre - collision interaction .",
    "this situation also occurs similarly for the antisymmetric collision of @xmath175 pulsons , shown in figure [ col_puls_s2_fig ] .",
    "however , the analytical solution for the limiting @xmath215 distribution is not so easily expressed in this case , so we omit it here .",
    "an even more complex situation develops when two @xmath175 compactons collide antisymmetrically , as shown in figure [ col_comp_s2_fig ] . in this case , not only",
    "do the colliding pulses develop two verticalities , but there is no limiting distribution as @xmath215 .",
    "in fact , one can show for @xmath175 compactons ( with the factor of @xmath216 omitted for convenience ) that @xmath217 so that the velocity at @xmath218 becomes unbounded as @xmath219 .",
    "however , as soon as @xmath125 reaches zero , the unbounded solution for @xmath8 switches sign and the pulses restore themselves with reversed polarity and move apart . as a final example we show in figure [ col_multi_fig ] the antisymmetric collision of `` multicompactons , '' again with the factor of @xmath216 omitted from the central hump for convenience .",
    "here we use a `` waterfall '' plot to depict the collision since an overlay would be too confusing .",
    "this collision results in the creation of eight verticalities at @xmath220 , @xmath221 , @xmath222 , and @xmath223 .",
    "again , as @xmath149 , the solution flips polarity instantaneously and the interaction reverses as the multicompactons move apart .",
    "the results in section [ iv_section ] for the initial value problem show that a train of pulses in the prescribed pulse shape @xmath10 emerges from any initial distribution and dominates the initial value problem . in this process , the initial distribution breaks up into a discrete number of pulsons , each of which travels at a speed equal to its height , and the pulsons collide elastically among each other as they recross the periodic domain .",
    "an interesting feature of equation ( [ epeqn ] ) is that it is time reversible , that is , invariant under @xmath224 and @xmath225 .",
    "thus , replacing @xmath226 with @xmath227 at any point in the numerical simulations causes the pulsons emerging in the initial value problems to reverse their evolution sequence ( but not their heights ) and collapse together into the initial distribution .",
    "thus the time - reversed series of collisions reforms the original initial distribution at @xmath228 .",
    "this process enables us in principle to determine the parameters @xmath206 , @xmath92 , @xmath88 , on the invariant manifold by running the pde ( [ epeqn ] ) forward in time until @xmath91 pulsons have emerged , then reversing the solution to recreate the original smooth initial distribution .",
    "similarly , we may run the pde forward until time @xmath229 , determine the parameters ( @xmath230 ) at this time , remove any residual velocity distribution from which pulsons have not yet emerged , then time - reverse the ordinary differential equation ( ode ) dynamics for a period @xmath229 to create an initial distribution containing only the pulson content that will emerge before time @xmath229 .",
    "should this process , denoted in obvious notation as @xmath231u(x,0)$ ] , produce an accurate approximation @xmath232 of the original distribution @xmath233 , it would be a useful procedure for approximately determining the pulson invariant manifold content of a given initial velocity distribution .",
    "figures [ iv_rev_ps1_fig ] and [ iv_rev_cs1_fig ] were constructed by running the pde forward in time from an initial gaussian distribution until trains of three peakons in figure [ iv_rev_ps1_fig ] and nine @xmath169 compactons in figure [ iv_rev_cs1_fig ] emerged . at this point time",
    "was reversed , and the pde was run _ in reverse _ for twice as long , then the solution was reflected in space . in this process trains of pulsons in reversed order ( with the tallest ones behind ) reassembled moving rightward into the original initial condition and then re - emerged as before ( with the tallest ones ahead ) .",
    "the same `` geodesic pulson scattering '' figures could be generated by running the initial gaussian distribution both forward and backward in time , then superposing the results .",
    "formally we have @xmath234 ( where @xmath235 is pde evolution for time @xmath236 and @xmath237 is reflection in space ) , for initial conditions that are symmetric about the origin .",
    "thus these figures could also have been generated by the process of evolution , reflection , then evolution again .",
    "this time reversal symmetry property indicates that the initial distribution may be regarded not just as a sum of pulsons , but as a moment in time at which a set of pulsons moving geodesically has collided to form a smooth distribution , in this case a gaussian .",
    "in equations ( [ epeqn ] ) and ( [ ueqn ] ) we have introduced a new family of hyperbolic pde describing a certain type of geodesic motion and for some members of this family we have studied its particle - like solutions .",
    "we call these solutions `` pulsons . ''",
    "we have shown that , once initialized on their invariant manifold ( which may be finite - dimensional ) , the pulsons undergo geodesic dynamics in terms of canonical hamiltonian phase space variables .",
    "this dynamics effectively reproduces the classical soliton behavior .",
    "we conjecture that this behavior occurs because of the preponderance of two - body elastic - collision interactions for the situation we consider of confined pulses and confined initial conditions .",
    "the dynamics we study in this framework of geodesic motion on a finite - dimensional invariant manifold seems to account for all of the classical soliton phenomena , including elastic scattering , dominance of the initial value problem by confined pulses and asymptotic sorting according to height  all without requiring complete integrability .",
    "thus , complete integrability is apparently not necessary for exact soliton behavior . regarding the `` formation '' of the pulsons :",
    "in fact , the pulsons must always be present , since they compose an invariant manifold .",
    "one discerns them in a given ( confined ) initial condition by using the isospectral property in the integrable cases , or just by waiting for them to emerge under the pde dynamics in the nonintegrable cases .",
    "however , there is no `` pattern formation '' process in this dynamics .",
    "rather , there is an `` emergence of the pattern , '' which is the pulson train .",
    "this conclusion is illustrated by figures [ iv_rev_ps1_fig ] and [ iv_rev_cs1_fig ] showing geodesic scattering of an incoming set of pulsons that collapses into a smooth `` initial '' distribution , then fans out again into an outgoing set of pulsons that is the mirror image of the incoming set .",
    "this parity - reflection is an implication of reversibility , as well ; since reversing the dynamics of a set of separated pulsons reassembles them into a smooth `` initial '' distribution , which is just their sum , with appropriate values for their initial `` moduli '' parameters @xmath238 , @xmath88 .",
    "the moduli parameters @xmath239 are collective phase space coordinates on an invariant manifold for the pde motion .",
    "once initialized , these collective degrees of freedom persist and emerge as a train of pulses , arranged in order of their heights .",
    "moreover , since their velocity is their peak height , small residual errors departing from the pulson superposition in the assignment of initial parameter values @xmath238 , @xmath88 , do not propagate significantly . on the real line ,",
    "such residual errors are simply left behind by the larger pulsons traveling more quickly . and",
    "on the periodic interval , these errors provide an occasional phase shift perturbation to the stable pulsons .",
    "these perturbations are seen in the figures as regions of curvature in the space - time trajectories of the pulsons .",
    "our main conclusions regarding the elastic collisions of the pulsons and their role in the pde initial value problem are the following :    1 .",
    "two - pulson interactions are elastic collisions that conserve total kinetic energy and transfer momentum , as measured by the asymptotic speeds and peak heights of the pulsons .",
    "the motion of the pulsons is governed by geodesic kinematics of particles with no internal degrees of freedom ; but with an interaction range , or spatial extent , which is given by their green s function , or wave form , @xmath10 .",
    "thus , these interactions are analogous to the collisions of billiard balls .",
    "this is especially clear for pulsons of compact support .",
    "the exact solution in equation ( [ vel_collide_eqn ] ) determines analytically the complex wave shapes and the strengths of the various singularities that may form during antisymmetric head - on collisions of pulsons and antipulsons .",
    "these singularities are verticalities in slope at which the velocity may diverge , take a finite value , or even vanish , depending on the choice of green s function . at the moment of collision ,",
    "the pulson and antipulson `` bounce '' apart and the polarity of the antisymmetric wave form reverses , @xmath240 .",
    "again this is analogous to billiards , but with the difference that the reversal of momentum reverses the polarity of the pulson velocity profile .",
    "note that the wave forms reverse polarity and bounce apart ; they do not actually `` pass through '' each other , although they may appear to do so .",
    "the dynamics on the pulson invariant manifold is dominated by the preponderance of two - body collisons . to the extent that the initial value problem for the pde takes place on the pulson invariant manifold",
    ", these two - pulson collisions should also dominate the solution of the pde dynamics .",
    "we conjecture this is so for most choices of confined pulse and initial conditions of finite extent for the family of pde ( [ epeqn ] ) with @xmath8 given in ( [ ueqn ] ) .",
    "thus , geodesy governs the motion and explains the elastic - scattering soliton phenomena we observe , without providing ( or even requiring there exists ) a means of analytically solving the initial value problem for this family of pde .",
    "even the motion on the pulson manifold is not integrable for @xmath241 , except in the cases corresponding to the camassa - holm , and dym integrable pde .",
    "similar geodesic but nonintegrable families of equations showing soliton behavior on a finite - dimensional invariant manifold may exist for other integrable geodesic equations , such as kdv .",
    "this work was supported in part by the computational science graduate fellowship program of the office of scientific computing in the department of energy . for their kind attention ,",
    "suggestions and encouragement , we are happy to thank r. camassa , p. constantin , p. fast , c. foias , i. gabitov , j. m. hyman , y. kevrekidis , s. shkoller , p. swart and s. zoldi .",
    "as discussed in section [ nmsection ] , we add dissipation in the higher modes for the simulations covered in this paper because the fourier pseudospectral method used is unstable to perturbations at the grid scale .",
    "these perturbations arise as a result of the gibbs phenomenon which causes an overshoot to occur at points of discontinuous slope in @xmath8 .",
    "such an overshoot forms negative values of the function @xmath8 , which can artificially create antipulsons that emerge and interact with positive pulsons to form verticalities in slope as described in section [ hosection ] . as an example",
    ", we tested the stability of the numerical method by initializing the domain with a perturbation at a single grid point , as @xmath242 for @xmath243 .",
    "this initial distribution was unstable and caused exponential growth in the neighboring grid points , such that @xmath244 and @xmath245 , resulting from the creation of a pulson - antipulson pair whose peaks grew unstably .",
    "we then ran the same initial condition with a dissipation coefficient of @xmath180 in equation ( [ hp_filter_eqn ] ) , which stabilized it .",
    "we also ran it again with a nonzero linear dispersion coefficient of @xmath246 in equation ( [ ep_kappa_eqn ] ) which stabilized it as well . adding dissipation damps the higher modes as specified in section [ nmsection ] while adding linear dispersion smooths discontinuities in @xmath8 , thus effectively damping the higher modes .",
    "thus , either dissipation or dispersion will suppress instability due to perturbations at the grid scale .",
    "figure [ kappa_nonzero_fig ] compares dissipative and dispersive dynamics for the case of @xmath247 compactons emerging from an initial gaussian velocity distribution .",
    "linear dispersion ( @xmath59 ) acts to smooth out discontinuities as well as hastening the emergence time of each pulson .",
    "this is demonstrated by the separation between the leading pulses for the @xmath248 and @xmath249 cases . despite the negligible difference in speed between the two ,",
    "the leading @xmath248 pulson is far ahead of the leading @xmath249 pulson , because the former was emitted sooner .",
    "stability is acquired by suppressing the higher modes , as shown in figure [ kappa_e_k_fig ] . here",
    "the power spectrum of one compacton is shown for both values of @xmath56 .",
    "introduction of linear dispersion with @xmath250 damps the higher modes by roughly three orders of magnitude .",
