    "the discovery of 51 peg b ( mayor and queloz 1995 ) in a remarkably tight orbit of 4.2 days around its sun - like host star challenged prevailing theoretical views and impelled rapid progress in expanded radial velocity ( rv ) surveys which have now resulted in about 50 planet detections ; see recent review by marcy , cochran and mayor ( 2000 ) .",
    "the existence of inner - orbit , gas - giant planets ( hot jupiters ) enables a highly - efficient photometric search for planets , since with tight orbits ( 0.04  0.05 au ) hot jupiters present about a 10% chance of transiting the host star given random orbital inclinations .",
    "indeed , the transiting planet of hd 209458 was observed ( charbonneau @xmath1  2000 , henry @xmath1  2000 )  on schedule \" , just as the ensemble of rv - detected hot jupiters neared the point of a 50% expectation for transits .",
    "hd 209458b verified the theory of guillot @xmath1  ( 1996 ) predicting somewhat extended radii of @xmath0 1.2  1.4 @xmath2 as a result of retarded cooling due to high irradiance from the host star .",
    "a transit depth of 1.7% and duration of 3.0 hrs for hd 209458b repeating every 3.525 days presents an enticing photometric signal .    in 1998",
    "when the number of detected extra - solar planets was @xmath010 , of which 4 were hot jupiters ( defined herein as @xmath3 5 days ) , we proposed ( in the  scientifically risky \" category ) to use wfpc2 on _ hst _ to observe a large ensemble of stars in 47 tuc .",
    "our target was selected : ( 1 ) to provide an ideal spatial and brightness distribution of stars matching @xmath4 capabilities , and ( 2 ) to shed insight into understanding the origins of planets by observing a system with reduced metallicity [ fe / h ] = @xmath50.7 , [ @xmath6/fe ] = + 0.4 dex ( salaris and weiss 1998 ) .",
    "our proposed field , with the crowded core of 47 tuc on the pc1 ccd of wfpc2 , provides some 40,000 main sequence targets ( giants are not of interest since the transit depth is equal to @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , @xmath9 are the planet and star radii respectively ) .",
    "saturation on the bright end occurs near the cluster turnoff where stellar radii are rapidly increasing and thus the expected signal dropping anyway .",
    "stars far down ( @xmath04 mags ) the main sequence remain viable targets since a rising signal from falling stellar radii would balance declining signal - to - noise ( s / n ) for these fainter stars .",
    "the frequency of hot jupiters ( 9 are now known ) in the solar neighborhood is about 1% , with about a 10% chance per system of random orbital inclinations yielding transits ; the 47 tuc ensemble should thus provide on the order of one planet per 1000 surveyed stars .",
    "to detect two consecutive transits requires an observing interval twice the orbital period with continuous ( relative to @xmath02  3 hr transit timescale ) coverage .",
    "our 8.3 days ( 120 orbits of _ hst _ , go-8267 ) of continuous observation spanned 1999 july 3  11 , the only data gaps resulted from earth occultations and passages through the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) .",
    "we chose the f555w and f814w filters for the primary time series with 160 s exposures ( cycled every 4 min in each ) , yielding saturation near @xmath10  @xmath0 17.1 at cluster turnoff .",
    "these two filters were alternated in a sequence typically consisting of 6@xmath11f555w and 6@xmath11f814w during each saa free orbit .",
    "visibility periods impacted by the saa were alternately devoted to one or the other filter . with the orbital period of @xmath1296.4 min ,",
    "each transiting system of interest should display at least two consecutive transits over the 8.3 days in each of two filters .",
    "( transits should be gray , while chance superposition of a main sequence star and a large amplitude but faint eclipsing binary , which in superposition mimics a planet transit in depth , would display very red signals . )",
    "the number of 160 s exposures obtained was : 636 ( f555w ) , 653 ( f814w ) .",
    "we took care to design the observations with significant margin such that minor changes in one or even several assumptions regarding number of stars , realized photometric precision , planet radius and hence signal amplitude , or assumed frequency of systems would not jeopardize a robust result .",
    "the primary consideration in detection margin is the ratio of signal amplitude to the time series precision multiplied by ( for gaussian noise ) the square root of the number of data points during transits .",
    "time series precisions reach nearly the poisson limit , _",
    "e.g. , _ at @xmath10  = 18.4 in 160 s a s / n of 200 ( or 0.0053 mag @xmath13 ) results in the f555w filter .",
    "the length of transits ( including reduction by @xmath14/4 for average chord lengths ) in hours ( geometry plus kepler s 3rd law ) and probability in % of transits per existing system given random inclinations are : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath9 are in solar units and @xmath17 in days . for a 47 tuc star at @xmath10  = 18.4 , @xmath16 = 0.81 , @xmath9 = 0.92 ( bergbusch & vandenberg 1992 ) , @xmath18 = 2.20 hrs ( up to 2.80 for central passages ) for @xmath17 = 3.8 d and @xmath19 = 9.6% . the transit depth ( assuming @xmath8 = 1.3@xmath2 ) is predicted to be 0.022 ( about 4@xmath20 per observation ) yielding a 11.5@xmath20 detection per transit per filter .",
    "overall this example would provide about a 23@xmath20 detection .",
    "full discussion of the analysis steps will appear in gilliland @xmath1  ( 2000 ) ; here we provide only a sketch of steps relevant to reaching poisson noise limited results for under - sampled , dithered , crowded - field photometry with the added complication of frame - to - frame focus drift .",
    "we do not believe that any software packages previously described in the literature would be up to the specialized and stringent requirements of this project and have therefore developed our own procedures and codes .",
    "gilliland @xmath1  ( 1995 ) discuss issues relevant to precise time - series photometry for under - sampled and dithered @xmath4 data ; the steps to robust cosmic - ray elimination using a polynomial expansion of the detected intensity as a function of @xmath21 offsets to create an over - sampled mean model remain central to the processing ( gilliland , nugent & phillips 1999 provide further details ) .",
    "initial frame - to - frame offsets are determined by psf fits to 4 relatively isolated stars in each frame . for each pixel a  surface \"",
    "fit of intensity as a function of sub - pixel @xmath21 offsets is formed with iterative elimination of multi - sigma positive deviations ( cosmic rays ) .",
    "the frame - to - frame offsets are then adjusted by solving for the @xmath21 offsets in a least - squares sense that provide a best match for evaluation of the analytic model ( using only pixels on bright , unsaturated stars ) to each frame .",
    "the image model and registration ( including plate scale changes ) solution are iterated two or three times to convergence .",
    "absolute photometry has been performed on @xmath114 over - sampled , co - added images using daophot ii ( stetson 1992 ) .",
    "a typical psf fwhm is 1.4 pixels ; pc and wf ccd plate scales are 0046 and 01 per direct pixel respectively .",
    "figure 1 shows the cmd of 47 tuc developed from our deep , well - dithered , co - added images in f555w ( 101,760s ) and f814w ( 104,480s ) .",
    "zero points of the instrumental magnitudes have been adjusted to best match 47 tuc @xmath10 , @xmath22  fiducials ( kaluzny @xmath1  1998 ) near main sequence turnoff .",
    "stars have been excluded if : 1 ) nominal apertures ( 69 pixel pc , 45 pixel wf ) touch saturated pixels from neighbors , 2 ) apertures include any bad pixels flagged in the data quality files ( except saturation ) , 3 ) if @xmath23 90% of the light in the aperture comes from wings of brighter nearby neighbors , or 4 ) more than 1% of the frames in both f555w or f814w show saturation in the core ( gain = 14 @xmath24 ) . for the results discussed further below only the 34,091 stars falling within a bright main sequence box as shown were analyzed for time series .",
    "the state - of - the - art for crowded - field , time - series photometry now involves creation of difference images ( _ e.g. , _ alcock @xmath1  1999 ; alard 1999 ) , where for well - sampled , ground - based ccd data excellent gains over classical psf fitting in direct images are realized . with good difference images non - variable objects are removed ( except for residual , unavoidable poisson noise ) leaving any variables clearly present as isolated ( positive or negative ) psfs even if the variable was badly blended with brighter stars in the direct images .",
    "extraction of precise relative photometry changes for any star in a difference image can be handled with either aperture photometry or psf fitting , and precise knowledge of the psf is much less critical for the difference images relative to attempting photometry on blended stars in the direct image .",
    "difference images were created for each individual frame using the intensity of @xmath21 analytic model evaluated at the position of each individual frame .",
    "such images , however , showed large residuals at each star in many images as a result of focus changes .",
    "the 2@xmath25  breathing \" of @xmath4 due to changing thermal stresses over orbits leads to a full amplitude redistribution of light inside - to - outside of a 1 pixel radius of @xmath020% .",
    "we have added the extra step of solving for a compensation kernal such that when convolved onto the analytic @xmath26 model it best matches individual frames .",
    "an iteration is now adopted over this focus compensation , the registration solution and the @xmath21 intensity analytic model .",
    "difference images can now be formed accounting for @xmath21 offsets and focus changes ; variable stars become obvious in movies of such images that were invisible in direct image movies .",
    "a time series was created by fitting a psf at the known position of individual stars in each image .",
    "normalization was performed using counts as a function of magnitude based on archival calibration images of the standard grw+70d5824 .",
    "each time series was cleaned by removing any changes linearly correlated with an ensemble average term and nine vectors comprising all terms through cubic in @xmath21 offsets .",
    "this decorrelation step usually does not provide much change for the inherently excellent @xmath4 time series .",
    "figure 2 shows the resulting time series @xmath13 of relative intensities ( magnitudes would be larger by @xmath111.086 ) for each of 34,091 stars in the f555w filter ( f814w results are similar ) .",
    "the lower curve shows the ideal photometry limit : our results are usually within @xmath010  15% of this . the upper  detection limit \" curve is a function of assumed planet radius , stellar radius along the main sequence , length of transits and density of sampling such that a ( gaussian noise ) @xmath13 value falling below this curve would provide @xmath23 6.5@xmath20 detection for two transits in each filter .",
    "the steep dropoff of the detection capability on the bright end results from increasing stellar radii near turnoff creating a lower predicted transit signal . at the faint end",
    "smaller stellar radii produce deeper , but shorter transits the s / n for which is overtaken by the loss in time - series s / n in the sky background limited regime .",
    "figure 3 shows a time series that presents a close approximation to expectations for a planet transit . the star has @xmath10",
    "= 19.01 , @xmath10   @xmath22  = 0.89 and two neighbors brighter by @xmath02.5 magnitudes at 05 separation .",
    "decreases of @xmath03% can be seen repeating every 1.34 days in both the direct @xmath10- and @xmath22-band time series ( a combined 28 @xmath20 detection ) . predicted transit depths from a planet at 1.3@xmath2 are 0.030 as seen .",
    "a 4@xmath20 significant secondary eclipse at phase 0.5 suffices for arguing this is not a planet .",
    "moreover , analysis of the saturated neighboring stars shows that one is a large amplitude eclipsing binary at the same period and phase .",
    "the light curve plotted results from the eclipsing - binary psf wings at the position of the faint star providing a diluted signal of an ordinary variable ; this is not a planet candidate .",
    "to search for multiple transits , we fold the time series of each individual star in each filter with sufficient trial phases and periods within 0.5 to 8.3 days to densely cover phase space .",
    "we then convolve the folded time series with the theoretical light curve corresponding to nominal transits .",
    "the convolution is normalized so that , for a white noise input , the convolution values are normally distributed with unit variance .",
    "possible transits are indicated by period  phase combinations with large positive values of the convolution ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . since the noise in the @xmath4 data is close to white , we selected a threshold of 6.3@xmath20 which should yield @xmath27 1 false alarm for the entire search space given gaussian statistics ( e.g. bevington 1969 )",
    ". a detailed description of procedures and results will appear in brown @xmath1  ( 2000 ) .",
    "a key issue in interpreting detections ( or lack thereof ) is the efficiency with which real transits would be detected by our search algorithms . to estimate this efficiency we inserted artificial transits into the data stream and processed the resulting modified data sets using the standard transit - detection pipeline .",
    "these were blind tests , in which the analyst had no knowledge of the properties of the inserted transits , nor of which stars were affected .",
    "one set of simulations inserted artificial transits by manipulating pixel values in the original images associated with 24 stars . by modifying the data at the image level",
    ", we verified that extensive image reduction and time series extraction steps used did not damage real transit signals .",
    "our procedures correctly retained evidence of transits through the image processing and time series levels of the analysis .    a more extensive test inserted artificial transits directly into the time series of about 10000 randomly chosen stars .",
    "this is enough samples to estimate the dependence of our detection efficiency on planetary radius and orbital period for the actual noise characteristics of our time series as a function of @xmath10 .",
    "figure 4 shows that the percentage of correctly categorized transit light curves depends strongly on assumed planet radius and more moderately on orbital period .",
    "the theoretical expectation ( guillot @xmath1  1996 ) is that ( irradiated ) planet radii vary only slowly as a function of mass .",
    "indeed , planets with sub - jovian mass may have slightly larger radii than a 1@xmath28 planet . also , over the two orders of magnitude mass range from planets to brown dwarfs to stars at the main sequence threshold , radii are not expected to vary by more than 10  20% .",
    "this lack of radius dependence on mass would be a hindrance if trying to interpret a handful of weak signals as planets ( rather than stars ) , but for a null result it implies a lack in the sample of any transiting planets , brown dwarfs or very late m dwarfs .",
    "assuming an occurrence rate for close - in giant planets that is the same as in the solar neighborhood ( 0.8  1.0% ) and a 10% probability of favorable orbital alignment , there should be about 30 transiting planets among our sample of 34091 stars .",
    "assuming planet radii of 1.3@xmath2 and a typical period of 3.5 days , and allowing for the actual distribution of @xmath10  magnitudes ( stellar radii and time series noise ) in our sample , the number of planets actually detected should have been about 17 .",
    "since we saw none , we may conclude ( with very high confidence ) that in so far as giant planet occurrence is concerned , the solar neighborhood and 47 tuc represent different populations .",
    "it was noted ( gonzalez 1997 ) with the first planet detections that host stars tend to be considerably more metal rich than the average star surveyed in the solar neighborhood . this correlation has been maintained ( laughlin 2000 ) with a much larger sample now available . a correlation with metallicity",
    "could , however , be either cause or effect .",
    "it could be that lower metallicity in protoplanetary nebulae causes a lower frequency of planet formation as a result of fewer dust grains for nucleation .",
    "it could be that higher metallicity in systems with a remaining close - in planet is an effect of inward migration of metal - rich planets onto the star ( lin , bodenheimer & richardson 1996 ) thus polluting the thin outer convective layer .",
    "our 47 tuc results are at least consistent with the hypothesis that lower metallicity biases against formation of hot jupiters .",
    "47 tucanae is a massive cluster with a density @xmath29 at 1from the core ( a typical location for our observations ) .",
    "in such a crowded environment , close encounters can result in dynamical interactions , particularly with passing binary systems , which lead to large changes in orbital parameters ( heggie 1975 ) .",
    "sigurdsson ( 1992 ) considered the orbital stability problem for high - mass - ratio systems ( in the context of pulsar - planets ) specifically for 47 tuc conditions and concluded that orbits as short as 5 days would be quite stable against disruption or forced merger even in the most dense core region .",
    "an avenue for destroying hot jupiters in the crowded 47 tuc core arises from consideration of tidal dissipation ( sigurdsson , lin & gilliland 2000 ) within the planet . in this",
    "scenario star - planet encounters with binaries can induce an eccentric planet orbit .",
    "dissipation of the stellar tidal disturbance within the planets drains their orbital energy .",
    "internal heating may cause the planets to expand and provide positive feedback to a disruptive process .",
    "critical to this scenario is the actual frequency of close binaries in 47 tuc which will be a valuable side - product of our survey for planets ( albrow @xmath1  2000 ) .",
    "alternative scenarios have been postulated where crowding limits planet formation ( armitage 2000 ) .",
    "we have shown that planets like 51 peg b that are found in @xmath01% of local stars surveyed must be an order of magnitude rarer in the lower - metallicity , crowded - stellar environment extant in the center of 47 tucanae .",
    "this represents a significant result delineating where planets exist .",
    "further observations of stars in different circumstances will be necessary to learn whether the dominant influence in reducing the planet frequency is low metallicity , a crowded environment , or some combination of these or other factors .",
    "we thank merle reinhart and patricia royle at stsci for assistance in scheduling these unique observations .",
    "this work was supported in part by stsci grant go-8267.01 - 97a to the space telescope science institute and several stsci grants from the same proposal to co - i institutions ."
