    "the evolution of the matter formed in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions is usually described within hydrodynamic  and transport models .",
    "the former allow one to incorporate the complicated evolution of the hot and dense system ( fireball ) at the possible phase transitions encoded in corresponding equation of state , while the latter make it possible to evaluate particle spectra taking into account the nonequilibrated character of their formation even at the early evolution stage .",
    "however , in realistic conditions , neither of these approaches nor their hybrids are able to reproduce particle spectra and correlations in a+a collisions . at present",
    "there is no scenario of the evolution allowing one to describe all the salient features of hadronic observables , including the interferometry or correlation radii related to the space - time scales of the fireball .",
    "particularly , the observed approximate energy independence of the radii is considered as the interferometry puzzle .",
    "it was noted @xcite , based on an analysis of the exact solution of the nonrelativistic boltzmann equation @xcite , that under specific conditions which could be realized at the moment when fireball starts to decay , e.g. , at the end of the pure hydrodynamic stage of the matter evolution , spectra and interferometry radii may become `` frozen '' at this early moment despite the particle emission and collisions between hadrons last for a fairly long period of the system decay .",
    "it was also proposed @xcite that this peculiar theoretical result can be used to test numerical transport models of a+a collisions and this is one of the aims of this paper .",
    "another aim is a study , within kinetic approach , to what extent is the conservation of spectra and interferometry radii violated during the system evolution in the case of more realistic initial conditions .",
    "this study is particularly interesting in the context of recently observed @xcite approximate conservation of interferometry volume during isentropic and chemically frozen hydrodynamic evolution of hadron - resonance gas and , it can be quite useful to solve the interferometry puzzle .",
    "the analysis of above phenomena has been done within universal kinetic model ( ukm ) @xcite , a monte carlo event generator , realized as a numerical code written in object oriented c++ language .",
    "the ukm gives a possibility to model kinetic processes inside a particle system applying a suitable numerical algorithm .",
    "this model is a universal one , since there is a possibility to choose and add particle system ( e.g. , system of hadrons , system of partons , etc . ) and to choose and add a particular numerical algorithm , i.e. , to choose and add different kinetic modeler . in our studies , we have used a cascade version of the ukm code , ukm - r @xcite , written under the root system @xcite .",
    "we use the same numerical cascade algorithm as implemented in the quark gluon string model @xcite .",
    "the paper is now organized as follows . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we relate particle spectra and two  particle correlation function with distribution and emission functions .",
    "section  [ sec3 ] deals with the theoretical aspects of the spectra formation , including a possible duality between kinetic and hydrodynamic approaches .",
    "section  [ sec4 ] is devoted to a brief ukm - r description . in section  [ sec5 ]",
    "we discuss the known exact solution of the nonrelativistic boltzmann equation for an expanding fireball with the spherically symmetric gaussian initial conditions .",
    "this solution is used in section  [ sec6 ] to test the ukm - r .",
    "section  [ sec7 ] deals with the influence of anisotropic initial conditions and relativistic effects on the final spectra and interferometry radii .",
    "the results are summarized in section  [ sec8 ] .",
    "the inclusive particle spectra are related to the averages of the products of creation and annihilation operators , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , calculated at sufficiently large time @xmath2 or , generally , on an asymptotic hypersurface @xmath3 , guaranteeing the absence of further interactions .",
    "thus @xmath4 in the case of independent ( chaotic ) particle production and subsequent system kinetic evolution , one can express the average of the product of four operators through the irreducible averages @xmath5 , similar to wick theorem for thermal systems .",
    "for identical spin-0 bosons @xmath6 in kinetic approach , the irreducible averages are expressed through the integrals or fourier transforms of the distribution function @xmath7 on the hypersurface @xmath8 : @xmath9 where , in the nondiagonal average in the second integral , @xmath10 is an off - mass - shell four - momentum and @xmath11 .",
    "the actual choice of @xmath2 does not matter due to the current conservation for free streaming particles and , due to the fact that , as a consequence of the relation @xmath12 , the four - vector product @xmath13 is independent of the position @xmath14 on the trajectory of a free off - mass - shell particle with four - momentum @xmath15 ( i.e. , @xmath13 is invariant with respect to transformations @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) .",
    "the distribution function @xmath7 is closely related with the current emission function @xmath18 on a hypersurface @xmath19 since it collects contributions of the emission or scattering points @xmath20 starting from those free particles with the three - velocity @xmath21 reach a point @xmath22 .",

    "similar to the above case , the momentum dispersion and the interferometry volume is practically conserved during the evolution .",
