    "hard - sphere ( hs ) particles provide a basic structural model for a wide variety of particulate systems ranging from the macroscale ( e.g. , packings of ball bearings ) to the microscale ( e.g. , colloidal suspensions or metallic glasses )  @xcite . at the microscale ,",
    "thermal motion is the equilibrium configuration sampling mechanism , whereas randomly applied external perturbations ( e.g. , vibrations ) can play an analogous role for macroscale systems .",
    "what is common across scales is the fundamental role of excluded volume due to the hard cores , which intrinsically limits the available configurational space of the system via strict geometric constraints .",
    "while such constraints have been extensively studied to gain insights into jamming phenomena  @xcite and the glass transition  @xcite , there is still much to be learned regarding the extent to which the hard - core interaction limits the possible structural arrangements of the particles  and hence the properties  of fluid systems .",
    "perhaps the most important measure of structure for homogeneous fluids is the radial distribution function , @xmath1 .",
    "the product @xmath2 quantifies the expected number of particle centers to be found in a shell of differential width @xmath3 a distance @xmath4 away from a given particle center in a fluid of number density @xmath5 .",
    "the core prevents particles from approaching closer than a particle diameter @xmath6 ; i.e. , @xmath7 for @xmath8 . in dense fluids ,",
    "packing constraints provided by the cores also give rise to a decaying oscillatory structure in @xmath1 for @xmath9 , signifying the coordination shells that naturally form around the particles .",
    "the coordination - shell structure quantified by the radial distribution function is critical for the thermodynamic properties ( e.g. , the equation of state ) of the fluid , but it can influence transport properties as well  @xcite .",
    "one question of fundamental interest and potential practical importance for materials design  @xcite is how much ` pair disorder ' can be accommodated by a fluid of particles with hard cores of diameter @xmath6 at a given packing fraction @xmath10 ?",
    "in other words , to what extent is it possible to suppress the core - induced oscillations in @xmath1 , e.g. , via incorporation of auxiliary pair interactions ?",
    "a particularly suitable metric for pair disorder in equilibrium systems , and the one adopted in this paper , is the two - body contribution that emerges in the multi - particle expansion of the excess ( i.e. , configurational , over ideal gas ) entropy , @xmath11  @xcite . for a fluid of @xmath12-dimensional particles with hard - core diameter @xmath6 and isotropic pair interactions",
    ", this quantity can be expressed in _ dimensionless _",
    "form , where boltzmann s constant , @xmath13 , is absorbed in the definition , as @xmath14 \\end{split}\\]]in equation  [ eqn : pair_excess_entropy ] , the first term in the sum , @xmath15 , is trivially due to the excluded volume of the hard core , while the second term accounts for any coordination - shell structure present in @xmath1 for @xmath9 . in seeking to find systems that maximize @xmath11 , it is important to ensure that known requirements for realizability are met . here , we follow convention and require the static structure factor @xmath16 , related to @xmath1 via the fourier transform ( ft ) @xmath17 ft@xmath18 $ ] , to be positive definite for all @xmath19 .",

    "any _ oscillatory coordination - shell structure appears realizable for fluids of particles with hard cores under these conditions . precisely at @xmath25 , the solution @xmath22 leads to hyperuniform structure ( long ranged density fluctuations are suppressed , @xmath26  @xcite ) and thus the system is incompressible . for packing fractions @xmath27",
    ", the step function solution would violate the realizability constraint , i.e. , exhibiting @xmath28 for some range of @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "hence , the maximally disordered pair structure for @xmath27 must generally be obtained via a numerical solution of equation  [ eqn : positive_definite ] . the low - density , analytical solution to the @xmath11 maximization problem of equation",
    "[ eqn : positive_definite ] described above also provides information pertaining to a so - called iso-@xmath0 [ i.e. , iso-@xmath29 process  @xcite .",
    "an iso-@xmath0 process is one where an equilibrium system at an initial packing fraction , @xmath30 ( in the above example , the hs fluid at @xmath31 ) , can realize an identical radial distribution function at a higher packing fraction @xmath10 by adding a @xmath10-dependent auxiliary pairwise interaction which counteracts any pairwise structural evolution that would have otherwise occurred . for a given iso-@xmath0 process",
    ", there is also a singular packing fraction , @xmath32 ( in the above example , @xmath33 ) , above which the pair correlation of the original state can no longer be realized because it would unphysically result in @xmath34 for some values of @xmath19 .",
    "irrespective of the chosen value for @xmath30 , iso-@xmath0 processes initiating from an equilibrium hs structure ( 1 ) necessarily grow in auxiliary , soft pair interactions external to the hard core at @xmath35 to prevent pair structure evolution and ( 2 ) terminate at an upper singular packing fraction @xmath36 at which @xmath37 , corresponding to an incompressible , hyperuniform state .",
    "since the pair structure of such an iso-@xmath0 process is , by definition , identical that of the hs fluid at the lower initial packing fraction ( @xmath38 ) , its pair disorder ( e.g. , as measured by @xmath11 ) at @xmath32 is always higher than that of an equi - density equilibrium hs fluid , but less than or equal to that obtained by a formal maximization of @xmath11 via equation  [ eqn : positive_definite ] .",
    "since an iso-@xmath0 process is technically simpler to analyze than a full @xmath39 maximization , the former is a helpful construct for studying how the enhancement of two - body disorder of a hard - core fluid affects the total _",
    "excess entropy , @xmath40 ( inclusive of all many - body correlation contributions ) and other related properties .",
    "navely , one might anticipate that muting pair structure would also increase the overall structural disorder of the system , which would conceptually align with factorization approximations in equilibrium statistical mechanics including the kirkwood superposition approximation that estimates the three - body distribution according to : @xmath41  @xcite . however , upon further examination , this logic directly contradicts expectations based on thermodynamics . for example , the auxiliary interactions that are added to the hard - core potential to preserve structure in an iso-@xmath0 process , as discussed more formally in section  [ results : step_isog ] , must necessarily cause a _ decrease _ in @xmath40 compared to the hs reference state ( despite the relative increase in @xmath11 ) .",
    "the magnitude of this decrease , which is due to corresponding ( and more than compensating ) enhanced structure in higher - body static correlations compared to the hs reference fluid , has not yet been explored and is one focal point of this work .",
    "probing the corresponding changes of @xmath40 and @xmath39 along iso-@xmath0 processes is also of interest given the empirically observed links between these quantities and dynamic properties of fluids  @xcite . for many fluid systems , changes that increase excess entropy ( or its two - body contribution )",
    "result in faster dynamical relaxation processes and vice - versa , even for systems that exhibit `` anomalous '' trends in dynamics  @xcite with respect to quantities like number density .",
    "while @xmath40 and @xmath39 are typically strongly correlated ( the latter is usually the dominant contribution to the former ) , they would yield conflicting dynamical predictions as a function of @xmath10 for iso-@xmath0 processes starting from a hs state at @xmath42 . from the perspective of @xmath39 ,",
    "an iso-@xmath0 process should produce enhanced dynamics relative to the hs fluid at the same packing fraction .",
    "this at odds with expectations based on behavior of @xmath40 , a quantity which is _ necessarily _ lowered relative to the hard sphere - fluid via an iso-@xmath0 process . while the magnitude of the @xmath40 reduction along an iso-@xmath0 path is unknown , a large decrease ( and implied dynamical slowdown ) might seem a reasonable expectation given the tendency toward incompressibility of an iso-@xmath0 fluid upon approach to the corresponding singular packing fraction @xmath32a topic we address in this paper .",
    "along similar lines , strong correlations between dynamical relaxation times and the excess compressibility factor have been observed in simulations of fluids with hard cores ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "whether such correlations also hold for iso-@xmath0 processes , where they would predict a pronounced dynamic slowdown approaching @xmath32 , remains an open question and a stringent test of their generality .",
    "also critical to understanding the static and dynamic properties displayed by systems of an iso-@xmath0 process are the @xmath10- ( and @xmath42- ) dependent auxiliary interactions which must be incorporated to keep the pair structure constant as packing fraction is increased .",
    "these interactions are known to be of a repulsive yukawa form at large inter - particle separations and strongly believed , in accordance with predictions from approximate integral equation theories , to be of a simple repulsive ramp - like form near contact for the step - function hs iso-@xmath0 process  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , a ramp - like interparticle potential was also recently shown to remove the coordination - shell structure of a tracer solute in a hs solvent  @xcite , and a ramp - like fluid - wall interaction is known to similarly ` flatten ' the density profile of a confined hs fluid  @xcite .",
    "to clarify the above issues , we seek to address the general accuracy of integral equation theory predictions for an iso-@xmath0 process , as tested by molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations , and confirm the possibly generic ramp - like interparticle potential form that apparently emerges for iso-@xmath0 processes that initiate from hs fluid reference states .",
    "moreover , while iso-@xmath0 processes provide a simple means by which to find interactions that increase @xmath39 ( relative to the hs fluid at the same packing fraction ) and hence help to explore the ensuing thermodynamic , dynamic , and potential interaction consequences , we also want to examine the impact of formally maximizing two - body disorder at arbitrary density ( see equation  [ eqn : positive_definite ] ) . here",
    ", we tackle this problem via numerical optimizations performed with a genetic algorithm to reveal the absolute limits of two - body disorder in hard - core fluids . of key interest",
    "is the residual structure that remains after @xmath11 maximization and the potentially unique changes in properties that the corresponding fluids display .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate a unique correspondence between minimizing pair disorder and suppressing structure not only @xmath43 in @xmath44 , but a continuous range in @xmath19 wavevectors .",
    "systems with a range of complete suppression in @xmath44 are termed `` stealthy '' since they are transparent ( do not scatter ) over a continuum of @xmath19  .",
    "the balance of this paper is organized into two primary sections .",
    "section  [ methods ] describes our liquid - state theoretical calculations , md simulations , and numerical optimizations .",
    "section  [ results ] outlines our thermodynamic , dynamic and auxiliary potential predictions for an array of iso-@xmath0 processes while also discussing our @xmath39 maximization results . section  [ conclusions ] concludes the paper and discusses some interesting future directions .",
    "we also provide a review in appendix a of iso-@xmath0 processes and the corresponding mathematical framework for their analysis ( used implicitly and referenced throughout the text ) .",
    "integral equation theory ( iet ) is a powerful tool of equilibrium statistical mechanics that is most frequently used for the forward prediction of @xmath1 and related thermodynamic properties based on knowledge of the dimensionless pair potential between particles , @xmath45  @xcite [ implicitly contains the inverse thermal energy @xmath46 where @xmath47 is temperature and @xmath13 is boltzmann s constant ] .",

    "this suggests the singular points are of virtually the same mobility as underlying hard spheres  a prediction we confirmed with molecular dynamics simulations for the step function @xmath1 ( or zero starting density ) iso-@xmath0 process .",
    "incompressibility at the singular densities is solely a manifestation of the divergent - ranged interactions required to maintain the lower - density radial distibution function , as opposed to a literal jamming transition .",

    "this effect is rather mild , particularly considering that bare hard spheres have a contribution to @xmath40 from @xmath39 of @xmath158 .",

    "while iso-@xmath0 processes produce hard - core fluids of augmented @xmath39 relative to pure hard spheres , a literal maximization of @xmath39 subject to the constraint of a positive - definite @xmath44 was performed to uncover the true limits of pair disorder . below @xmath160 ,",
    "the solution is the trivial step function @xmath1 ( degenerate with iso-@xmath0 processes beginning at @xmath31 ) . above @xmath160 ,",
    "some degree of structure in @xmath1 must remain for realizability . as density",
    "is increased , the optimized @xmath39 is increasingly greater than the @xmath39 of equidensity hard spheres ; however , this is a reflection of the greater available ( i.e , non - hard core ) @xmath39 at higher densities for hard spheres . expressed as a percentage of @xmath39 available to the optimization , we see that relative change in @xmath39 actually decreases as a function of density , reflecting that physical realizability is a more difficult constraint to satisfy at higher densities .",
