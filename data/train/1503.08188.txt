    "the connection between two important disciplines of physics , namely quantum information theory and condensed matter physics , has been the subject of great interest recently , generating much activity at the border of these fields , with numerous interesting questions addressed so far @xcite . in particular , the properties of entanglement in many - body systems , and the analysis of its behavior in critical systems deserve special attention .    in this work",
    "we deal with the entanglement of indistinguishable fermionic particles in the one dimensional extended hubbard model ( ehm ) .",
    "we focus in the half - filling case .",
    "the model is a generalisation of the hubbard model @xcite , which encompasses more general interactions between the fermionic particles , such as an inter - site interaction , thus describing more general phenomena and a richer phase diagram .",
    "precisely , it is given by , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the lattice size , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are creation and annihilation operators , respectively , of a fermion with spin @xmath4 at site @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and we consider periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) , @xmath8 .",
    "the hopping ( tunnelling ) between neighbor sites is parametrized by @xmath9 , while the on - site and inter - site interactions are given by @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively . despite the apparent simplicity of the model , it exhibits a very rich phase diagram , which includes several distinct phases , namely : charge - density wave ( cdw ) , spin - density wave ( sdw ) , phase separation ( ps ) , singlet ( ss ) and triplet ( ts ) superconductors , and a controversial bond - order wave ( bow ) .",
    "a more detailed description of the model and its phases will be given in the next section .",
    "our numerical analysis is performed employing entanglement measures for indistinguishable particles introduced recently @xcite , in conjunction with the density - matrix renormalisation group approach ( drmg)@xcite , which has established itself as a leading method for the simulation of one dimensional strongly correlated quantum lattice systems .",
    "dmrg is a numerical algorithm for the efficient truncation of the hilbert space of strongly correlated quantum systems based on a rather general decimation prescription .",

    "see fig.[phase.diagram.ehm ] for a schematic drawing of the phase diagram at half - filling .        in the strong coupling limit ( @xmath12 ) , one can qualitatively characterize its phases as given by a charge - density wave , spin density wave and a phase separation . for a strong repulsive on - site interaction ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) ,",

    "the ground state is dominated by the following configurations , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the set of translation operators .    in the weak coupling limit , different phases appear . for small attractive inter - site interactions ( @xmath26 ) ,",
    "superconducting phases are raised , characterized by the pairing correlations , @xmath31 with the respective order parameter @xmath32 .",
    "if the on - site interactions are lower than the inter - site interactions ( @xmath33 ) , the fermions will pair as a singlet superconductor , characterized by nearest - neighbor ( @xmath34 ) or on - site ( @xmath35 ) singlet pairing correlations given by , @xmath36 where @xmath37 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the on - site interactions are higher than the inter - site interactions ( @xmath38 ) , we have a triplet superconductor , characterized by nearest - neighbor triplet pairing correlations ( @xmath39 ) given by , @xmath40 where @xmath37 .",
    "note that the difference between the singlet and triplet pairing correlations is simply a plus or minus sign .",
    "it can be clarified if we consider , for example , the case of two fermions in a singlet or triplet spin state , given by @xmath41 . expanding this state , we have , @xmath42 where the lower / upper sign corresponds to the singlet / triplet pairing correlation .    the last phase in the diagram",
    "is the controversial bond - order - wave ( bow ) . by studying the ehm ground state broken symmetries , using level crossings in excitation spectra , obtained by exact diagonalization , nakamura @xcite argued for the existence of a novel bond - order - wave phase for small to intermediate values of positive u and v , in a narrow strip between cdw and sdw phases .",
    "this phase exhibits alternating strengths of the expectation value of the kinetic energy operator on the bonds , and is characterized by the following order parameter , @xmath43 ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the kinetic energy operator associated with the @xmath45th bond .",
    "nakamura argued that the cdw - sdw transition is replaced by two separate transitions , namely : ( i ) a continuous cdw - bow transition ; and ( ii ) a berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) spin - gap transition from bow to sdw .",
    "such remarkable proposal was later confirmed by several works @xcite , employing different numerical methods , like dmrg , monte carlo or exact diagonalization .",
    "nevertheless , while the bow - cdw phase boundary can be well resolved , since it involves a standard second order ( continuous ) phase transition , the sdw - bow boundary is more difficult to locate , for it involves a bkt transition in which the spin gap opens exponentially slowly as one enters the bow phase .",
    "the precise location of the bow phase is then still a subject of debate . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the best estimates for the transitions , taking @xmath46 , correspond to a cdw - bow transition at @xmath47 @xcite , and to a bow - sdw transition in the range @xmath48 @xcite , or @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "despite widely studied in systems of distinguishable particles , entanglement or more general notions of quantum correlations have received less attention in the case of indistinguishable particles . in this case , the space of quantum states is restricted to symmetric ( @xmath50 ) or antisymmetric ( @xmath51 ) subspaces , depending on the bosonic or fermionic nature of the system , and the particles are no longer accessible individually , thus eliminating the usual notions of separability and local measurements , and making the analysis of correlations much subtler .",
    "in fact , there are a multitude of distinct approaches and an ongoing debate around the entanglement in these systems @xcite . nevertheless , despite the variety , the approaches consist essentially in the analysis of correlations under two different aspects : the correlations genuinely arising from the entanglement between the particles ( entanglement of particles ) @xcite , and the correlations arising from the entanglement between the modes of the system ( entanglement of modes ) @xcite . these two notions of entanglement are complementary , and the use of one or the other depends on the particular situation under scrutiny . for example , the correlations in eigenstates of a many - body hamiltonian could be more naturally described by entanglement of particles , whereas certain quantum information protocols could prompt a description in terms of entanglement of modes .",
    "once one has opted for a certain notion of entanglement , there are interesting methods to quantify it @xcite .",
    "entanglement of modes can be understood by mapping the quantum state in its number representation , namely , @xmath52 where @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is an arbitrary set of @xmath55 fermionic operators describing the single particle modes of the system ( not necessarily the real space modes as in the hamiltonian definition ) .",
    "we will denote hereafter as `` configuration representation ( number representation ) '' the left ( right ) side of the previous equation .",
    "such equation corresponds to a mapping to distinguishable qubits , represented by the occupied ( @xmath56 ) or unoccupied ( @xmath57 ) modes , which then allows one to employ all the tools commonly used in distinguishable quantum systems in order to analyze their correlations .",
    "one could , for example , use the von neumann entropy of the reduced state representing a block with @xmath58 modes , in order to quantify the entanglement between this block with the rest of the modes .",
    "the reduced state is obtained by the partial trace in the number representation ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "notice that , in the mode representation , _ local _ observables may actually involve correlations between particles .",
    "for example , in the hubbard model , although the operator `` @xmath60 '' acts locally at the @xmath5th site ( real space modes ) , it describes pairing correlations between particles .",
    "the algebra of local observables at the modes , defined in the number representation , is generated by , @xmath61 where @xmath62 , with @xmath63 and @xmath64 is the identity operator acting on mode @xmath65 . in this way ,",
    "unentangled states are those which can be completely described by such local observables .",
    "it is known that such states are simply the separable states in the usual tensor product form , @xmath66 .",
    "based on the previous reasoning , we now define the notion of _ entanglement of particles_. notice first that one can not analyze the system under the usual paradigm of _ separability and locality _ , where the reduced states obtained by partial trace are mixed ( @xmath67 ) , whenever the global state is pure and entangled . therefore , in the case of indistinguishable particles in the configuration representation , the use of partial trace to characterize entanglement should be carefully reviewed , since it would suggest that all pure fermionic states are entangled , given that their reduced states are always mixed . in order to generalize the notion of entanglement for systems of indistinguishable particles , the approach based on the algebra of observables sheds light on the problem and allows us to go beyond the paradigm of separability and locality .",
    "we now define the proper algebra of `` local observables '' as the one composed by operators which do not create correlations between the indistinguishable particles .",
    "such algebra , defined in the configuration representation , is generated by the following single particle operators , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the number of particles .",
    "equivalently , using the second quantization formalism , the above set is given by the number conserving quadratic operators , @xmath70 .",
    "the states that can be completely described by such algebra form , in this way , the set of unentangled states , where any particle is not entangled with any other .",
    "intuitively , we would expect that this set corresponded to single slater determinants with fixed particle number .",
    "more precisely , for a system with @xmath69 fermions , it is given by , @xmath71 where @xmath72 is an arbitrary set of fermionic operators .",
    "recall that these operators can not be quasiparticles with particle - hole superpositions , as usual in a bogoliubov transformation , since the above states have a fixed number of fermions .",
    "in fact , distinct approaches confirmed that such set does indeed correspond to the unentangled states @xcite .",
    "the only non - classical correlation present in such states is the _ exchange _ , due to the antissymetrization , which does not constitute entanglement .",
    "for example , in @xcite the analysis follows by using a very elegant mathematical formalism , called gns ( gelfand - naimark - segal ) construction , for the case of two fermions , each one with hilbert space dimension 3 or 4 , and two bosons with dimension 3 ; in @xcite the authors propose a `` generalized entanglement ( ge ) '' measure , obtaining a simple formula for the `` partial trace '' , and the set of fermionic unentangled states for an arbitrary number of particles ; or also in @xcite , where a general notion of quantum correlation beyond entanglement ( the _ quantumness _ of correlations ) is investigated by means of an `` activation protocol '' , which yields the same set of states with no _ quantumness _ as the above unentangled one .",
    "as in the case of distinguishable modes , the von neumann entropy also provides a good quantifier for the entanglement of indistinguishable particles .",
    "we can define the shifted von neumann entropy of entanglement @xcite as follows , @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the single particle reduced state , the partial trace is taken in the configuration space , and @xmath75 is the von neumann entropy .",
    "such a quantifier is obtained simply by noticing that each extremal state in the one particle reduced space is respective to a unique single slater determinant @xcite . more precisely , the single particle reduced state of a single slater determinant ( as eq . )",
    "is given by , @xmath76 and its particle entanglement is null , @xmath77 .",
    "if the state can not be described by a single slater determinant , its entanglement is necessarily non null , @xmath78 , and at least one of its particles is entangled with another one .",
    "maximally entangled states have their single particle reduced states described by the maximally mixed state , as for example , the strong coupling limit phases sdw , cdw , and ps , as described in eqs .",
    ", , , respectively , whose reduced state is given by , @xmath79 which have maximal von neaumann entropy , @xmath80 , and consequently maximal particle entanglement , @xmath81 .",
    "if the hamiltonian has certain symmetries , its ground state entanglement can be analytically calculated as a simple function of its quadratures @xcite . in our particular case , from both @xmath82 and translational symmetries in the extended hubbard model , formally given by , @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the annihilation ( creation ) fermionic operator of a particle in the @xmath5th site , with spin @xmath4 , and @xmath85 is the ground state of the hamiltonian , we have that its single particle reduced state ( @xmath86 ) is disjoint in the subspaces with distinct spin , @xmath87 , and each of these terms is given by a circulant matrix , @xmath88 @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the lattice size . in this way the matrix is easily diagonalized , and its eigenvalues @xmath91 are given by a fourier transform of the quadratures , @xmath92 .",
    "\\label{eigen.mom.space}\\ ] ] the entanglement is then directly obtained from eq.([shifted.ent ] ) .",
    "the computation of the single particle correlations , and consequently the entanglement of particles , was numerically performed using dmrg . although dmrg is less accurate for problems with periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) than with open boundary conditions ( obc ) , from the physical viewpoint pbc are strongly preferable over obc , as boundary effects are eliminated and finite size extrapolations can be performed for much smaller system sizes . in this work",
    "we analyze the extended hubbard model considering pbc .",
    "our simulations were performed for systems up to @xmath93 sites , always keeping a large enough dimension ( @xmath45 ) for the renormalized matrices ( ranging from @xmath94 to @xmath95 ) and number of sweeps ( @xmath96 sweeps ) , in order to obtain an accurate precision . in fig.[error.analysis ] , we see that @xmath45 ranging from @xmath97 to @xmath98 is enough for an entanglement accuracy of the order of @xmath99 . the accuracy for the ground state energy , as well as the truncation error , using such parameters , are of the order of @xmath100    , as a function of @xmath45 ( dimension of the renormalized matrices ) , at the point @xmath101 , and using @xmath102 sweeps in the computation , which is enough for the ground state convergence . ]    our results for the entanglement of particles in the extended hubbard model at half - filling are shown in fig.[phase.diagram.ent.part ] , to be dissected below .",
    "it is remarkable that such picture highlights the known phase diagram of the model .",
    "we first note that , as expected , we have a maximum of entanglement at the strong coupling limits ( @xmath103 ) , and as we decrease the interactions between the particles , the entanglement tends also to decrease , until the unentangled case for the non interacting hamiltonian ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "the figure thus presents the shape of a valley around this point .",
    "following then the discontinuities and the local minimum points in the entanglement , we can easily identify the quantum phase transitions , except for both the subtle sdw - bow transition , and the transition between the superconductor phases ts - ss . in the former case",
    ", one needs to recall that the observation of the bow phase is by itself a hard task , since its gap opens exponentially slowly , and also that there are evidences that such transition is of infinite order @xcite .",
    "therefore we believe that a possible detection of such transition by the entanglement of particles would require higher precision numerical analysis as well as the study of larger lattice sizes .",
    "concerning the ts - ss transition , on the one hand the order of the two superconducting phases transition is controversial , being identified as a bkt transition @xcite as well as a second order one @xcite in the literature . on the one hand , we would be led to strengthen the result of a bkt transition , since our entanglement does not detect it . on the other hand , it is reasonable the apathy of the entanglement of particles on distinguishing the two phases , since the correlations between the particles in the two superconducting phases have essentially the same characteristics .",
    "thus it is hard to precisely conclude the reason for the failure to detect such transition with our measure of entanglement .    '' as a function of the interaction terms @xmath105 and @xmath106 , in a system with @xmath107 sites at half - filling .",
    "the entanglement behavior in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath108 , keeping fixed the filling @xmath109 , is qualitatively the same , with slight differences of the order of @xmath110 in its magnitude ; see appendix [ sec.finite.size.scaling ] for a detailed discussion .",
    "the ( green ) continuous line denotes the discontinuity at the entanglement function , while the ( red ) dashed line denotes the local minima .",
    "the white dots correspond to the points where we performed a detailed finite - size scaling analysis ( see table i in appendix [ sec.finite.size.scaling ] ) . ]",
    "the discontinuities in the entanglement are directly identified with the first order quantum phase transitions , whereas the minimum points are identified with the second order quantum phase transitions .",
    "when crossing a first order transition , the ground state energy presents a discontinuity and consequently also its observables . in this way , the eigenvalues `` @xmath111 '' of the single particle reduced density matrix ( eq . ) , and the entanglement obtained from them , should present a discontinuity .",
    "the occurrence of the minimum points are due to the divergence of the correlation length when approaching the second order transitions .",
    "as described in the previous section , the eigenvalues `` @xmath111 '' are given in momentum space by the fourier transform of the real space quadratures `` @xmath112 '' ( eq.([eigen.mom.space ] ) ) . in this way , if we are close to the transitions , such real space quadratures tend to become delocalised or spread out along the lattice , thus leading to more localised eigenvalue distributions in momentum space , and consequently to smaller von neumann entropies .",
    "it is worth remarking that such behavior is the opposite of the entanglement of modes , where the sites are maximally entangled at the second order transitions . as an example , see in fig.[momentum.eig ] the eigenvalue distribution for a system with @xmath107 sites when crossing the bow - cdw quantum phase transition .

    "more specifically , we show the entanglement behavior in the ps - ss - cdw , ps - ss - sdw , and ps - sdw - cdw transitions . notice that our finite - size scaling analysis showed that in thermodynamic limit the entanglement behavior is qualitatively similar ( see appendix ) , with a scaling inversely proportional to the lattice size , @xmath114 , where @xmath115 and @xmath116 are constants .      in fig.[slice.ps.ss.cdw ]",

    "<S> we associate the discontinuities to first order transitions , and the minima to second order ones . </S>",
    "<S> thus we show that the entanglement of particles can be used to derive the phase diagram , except for the subtle transitions between the phases sdw - bow , and the superconductor phases ts - ss . </S>"
