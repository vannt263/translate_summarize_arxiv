    "since observations show that space is homogeneous at large scales to a very good approximation , homogeneous models have been studied for many decades in classical and quantum cosmology @xcite .",
    "they provide insights into the behavior of our universe while avoiding all the complicated field theoretic details of full gravity by their restriction to finitely many degrees of freedom . despite the huge reduction by infinitely many degrees of freedom , a large variety of different models",
    "is left which allow a detailed investigation of various non - trivial issues such as : dirac observables , the embedding of symmetric models ( e.g. , isotropic ) into less symmetric ones , dynamics , the approach to classical singularities and cosmological phenomenology .",
    "loop quantum cosmological methods for those models have recently been developed @xcite and shown to simplify considerably after a diagonalization of the connection and triad degrees of freedom @xcite . as an example the dynamics of the bianchi i model has been studied and shown to be singularity - free . in this case",
    "the hamiltonian constraint resembles that of the full theory @xcite ( albeit it is much simpler ) , and thus the quantization can be regarded as a reliable test .",
    "it turned out that the extension from the isotropic case @xcite to this anisotropic case , requires certain features which are in fact present in quantum geometry .",
    "in particular , the mechanism of a singularity - free evolution in anisotropic models relies on the fact that the evolution extends through the classical singularity which can be identified with a submanifold in minisuperspace .",
    "this requires the classical singularity to lie in the interior of minisuperspace , rather than at the boundary ( including infinity ) .",
    "here it is essential that quantum geometry is based on densitized triad variables where in fact the kasner singularity is in the interior ( all densitized triad components being zero ) , while it would be on the infinite boundary in co - triad variables .",
    "the isotropic case is not sensitive to this issue since both densitized and co - triad variables have the classical singularity in the interior of minisuperspace ( here , it is essential to use any ( co-)triad rather than metric variables ) ; thus the existence of the extension of the methods to a homogeneous model is non - trivial .",
    "an extension to the full theory of the general class of inhomogeneous models seems much more complicated at this point .",
    "however , it has been conjectured @xcite that at the classical level , the most general homogeneous behavior is that of the bianchi - ix model and furthermore that it describes the approach to the singularities even of _ inhomogeneous _ models .",
    "it is therefore important to study the more general bianchi class a models .",
    "homogeneous models other than bianchi i , however , present an additional complication since they have non - zero intrinsic curvature and , as a consequence , their spin connection can not be zero .",
    "this is in contrast even to the full theory where the spin connection can be made arbitrarily small locally by choosing appropriate coordinates . in a homogeneous model the freedom of choosing coordinates",
    "is restricted to those which preserve ( manifest ) homogeneity , and this implies that the spin connection is a covariant object and that it has to have a certain size in a given model .",
    "this has to be taken into account properly when one quantizes the hamiltonian constraint . in particular , in a classical regime",
    "only the extrinsic curvature can be assumed to be small , but not necessarily the intrinsic curvature which determines the spin connection .",
    "this is essential to understand the semiclassical behavior .",
    "since a special treatment is required which is not necessary in the full theory , one has to be more careful when interpreting the results .",
    "it introduces more quantization ambiguities which have to be shown not to influence main results . on the other hand ,",
    "more possibilities for phenomenology emerge which , at least qualitatively , can often be seen to be insensitive to ambiguities .    having a more distant relation to the full theory , it is helpful to have a set of admissibility criteria .",
    "one such criterion is of course to accommodate a semiclassical approximation to the quantum dynamics .",
    "since a semiclassical description is based on continuum geometry while the quantum dynamics is in terms of discrete quantum geometry , this criterion is formulated here in terms of a _ continuum approximation_. a further criterion is provided by the requirement of a _ locally stable evolution _ @xcite .",
    "such a requirement arises because the evolution equation derived along the lines of @xcite is usually a high order difference equation which at large volume is well approximated by the second order wheeler ",
    "dewitt differential equation .",
    "hence , one can always construct solutions by choosing initial data , at large volume , to be that provided by solutions of the wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation .",
    "perturbation of such an initial data will generate solutions which will also include surplus solutions of the high order difference equation .",
    "generically these will have planck scale oscillations .",
    "there is then the possibility that such extra solutions can become dominant under the evolution .",
    "in fact these are expected to become dominant as one gets to smaller volume since there are huge differences between the continuum and the discrete formulations in the planck regime .",
    "however as one evolves to larger volumes , the perturbations must not grow too rapidly since this would imply domination by solutions with planck scale oscillation even in the classical regime .",
    "the requirement we are looking for , local stability , prohibits this behavior by demanding that the local behavior of solutions to the difference equation around a large value of the evolution parameter is not exponentially increasing . in this paper",
    "we present a quantization of the hamiltonian constraint for bianchi models with non - zero intrinsic curvature which fulfills this condition and has the correct semiclassical limit .",
    "the first quantization given in @xcite was not admissible in this sense ; thus , the quantization given there is valid only for the bianchi i model ( for which we have the same quantization here ) .",
    "it turns out that the local stability condition is selective : it requires all roots of a high order polynomial to have unit norm which is not easy to achieve randomly .",
    "the selectivity is increased by the fact that the same strategy of quantizing a hamiltonian constraint should work in all homogeneous models , using different procedures in different models would imply that not all of them can be related to the full theory",
    ".    the stability condition can be side - stepped by quantizing connection components in the constraint by hand such that only a second order difference equation results . while this would eliminate local stability as a selection criterion",
    ", it would also imply that the quantization is even more distant to that in the full theory where such a quantization can not be possible .",
    "further clues as to the necessary order of the evolution equation can come from studying dirac observables , which will be pursued elsewhere .    in section [ s : models ] , we briefly describe the diagonal , homogeneous models addressed in this paper . we recall the classical framework and the corresponding loop quantization , including a quantization of inverse triad components and general aspects of the hamiltonian constraint equation . here",
    "we also discuss the two criteria of admissibility of the continuum approximation and local stability .    in section [ hami ] , we present a quantization of the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "since the hamiltonian constraint now also has a potential term depending on the spin connection , a quantization of the spin connection is required .",
    "this is done using the quantization of inverse triad components .",
    "we derive the ( partial ) difference equation satisfied by the physical states and show that in the continuum approximation , to the leading order , the approximating differential equation is precisely the wheeler - dewitt equation with a specific factor ordering dictated by the underlying loop quantization . we also show that the requirement of local stability is satisfied .",
    "we demonstrate that the singularity avoidance mechanism found in the case of bianchi i @xcite continues to hold for these more general models .",
    "we conclude that the proposed quantization of the hamiltonian constraint is satisfactory with respect to all our requirements .    in section [ bianchiix ] , we focus attention on the modification of the potential implied by the quantization of the spin connection . the non - trivial and non - perturbative behavior of the inverse triad components may be expected to lead to substantial modifications of the potential at small triad components . in view of the conjectured central role of the bianchi ix potential , we present a brief description of this potential and its implications for the modified approach to classical singularities .",
    "in the following , we restrict attention to the so called diagonal , bianchi class a models . among the class of homogeneous models i.e. models",
    "whose symmetry group acts transitively on the spatial manifold , is the sub - class of the bianchi models for which the symmetry group contains a subgroup with simply transitive action on the spatial manifold .",
    "the simply transitive subgroups are classified in terms of three integers , @xmath0 , parameterizing the structure constants as @xmath1 only class a models for which @xmath2 admit a canonical formulation .    in the connection formulation , bianchi class",
    "a models are described in terms of the invariant connections and densitized triads given by , @xmath3 with constant and canonically conjugate @xmath4 , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 are left - invariant ( with respect to the subgroup acting simply transitively ) 1-forms on the spatial manifold @xmath7 and @xmath8 are corresponding dual density - weighted vector fields .",
    "the 1-forms satisfy the maurer - cartan equations @xmath9    in the metric formulation , _ diagonal _ homogeneous models are those for which the spatial metric can be written in a diagonal form such that only three degrees of freedom remain . in the connection formulation the situation is analogous . to begin with",
    "one has nine degrees of freedom , @xmath4 but with a three parameter gauge freedom of su(2 ) rotations of the index @xmath10 .",
    "a further freedom , depending upon the parameters @xmath0 , would have been available if the left - invariant 1-forms were not thought of as a background structure in parameterizing the invariant connections .",
    "to get the same three degrees of freedom as in the diagonal metric formulation , one then restricts the @xmath4 to a  diagonal form \" , @xmath11 and correspondingly @xmath12 where the so(3)-matrix @xmath13 includes gauge degrees of freedom ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "such a restriction specifies the diagonal models in the connection formulation .",
    "this is _ not _ a symmetry reduction in the same sense as restriction to isotropic models is .",
    "nevertheless , these restricted models can be analyzed by following procedures similar to those in the context of symmetry reductions .",
    "as in reductions to isotropic models , this leads to significant simplifications in such diagonalized models because the gauge parameters in @xmath13 and ( almost ; see below ) gauge invariant parameters , @xmath14 , are neatly separated @xcite .      the basic variables for diagonal bianchi class a models are specified via @xmath15 in terms of the ` gauge invariant ' coefficients @xmath14 with the pure gauge degrees of freedom contained in the @xmath16-matrix @xmath13 .",
    "the components @xmath14 are not completely gauge invariant but subject to residual discrete gauge transformations which change the sign of two of the three components simultaneously .",
    "a diagonal densitized triad has the form @xmath17 where @xmath8 are left - invariant densitized vector fields dual to @xmath6 .",
    "being an so(3)-matrix , @xmath13 satisfies @xmath18    the triad components @xmath19 are subject to the same residual gauge transformations as the connection components @xmath14 to which they are conjugate with basic poisson bracket @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the barbero ",
    "immirzi parameter and @xmath22 the gravitational constant .",
    "we will use the value @xmath23 fixed by the black hole entropy calculations @xcite .",
    "a diagonal co - triad has the form @xmath24 with @xmath25 note that the components @xmath19 as well as @xmath26 can take negative values , but only the overall sign @xmath27 ( i.e. , the orientation ) and the absolute values @xmath28 are gauge invariant . with this form of the co - triad ,",
    "we obtain , in fact , a diagonal metric @xmath29    the extrinsic curvature also has diagonal form with components @xmath30 which appear in the relation @xmath31 defining the ashtekar connection components @xmath14 in terms of the spin connection components @xmath32 and the extrinsic curvature .",
    "the form of the spin connection introduces a dependence of the framework on the particular model via the structure constants @xcite : @xmath33 note that in contrast to the full theory , the spin connection is a covariant object within a homogeneous model since coordinate transformations have to respect the symmetry .",
    "consequently , if non - zero , it can not be made small by choosing appropriate local coordinates .",
    "the only model which has identically vanishing spin connection is the bianchi i model with @xmath34 .",
    "otherwise , the spin connection is non - zero and can even depend on the triad ( it is a constant @xmath35 in the closed isotropic model , a submodel of bianchi ix , with @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) .",

    "it has been shown that the kasner singularity disappears when the model is quantized along the lines of loop quantum cosmology .",
    "for this result it was important that quantum geometry is based on _",
    "densitized triad _",
    "variables rather than co - triad variables . in those variables ,",
    "all @xmath60 decrease to zero when one approaches the classical singularity . by contrast , for the minisuperspace described in terms of the scale factors or co - triad variables ( @xmath26 ) , the singularity is reached when at least one of them goes to infinity .",
    "we paraphrase this by saying that the classical singularity lies in the _ interior _ of the triad minisuperspace ( containing triads of both orientations and also degenerate ones ) .",
    "bianchi models other than bianchi i have non - vanishing structure constants and thus the evolution of the three triad components can be described as motion in a non - trivial potential given by @xmath61 which has infinite walls at small @xmath19 owing to the divergence of the spin connection components ( see fig .",
    "[ potclass ] ) .",
    "the evolution can then be described approximately as a succession of kasner epochs with intermediate reflections at the potential @xcite . for the bianchi ix model",
    "the reflections never stop and the classical evolution is believed to be chaotic @xcite .",

    "it is often easier to work with non - gauge invariant states in intermediate steps and project to gauge invariant ones in the end .",
    "together with the basic derivative operators @xmath62 we need multiplication operators which usually arise from ( point ) holonomies @xmath76 with action @xmath77 and correspondingly for @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "from the basic operators we can build more complicated ones .",
    "we will later need a quantization of the spin connection which is a composite operator containing several triad operators .",
    "in particular , it also contains inverse powers of triad components which classically diverge at the singularity .",
    "since the triad operators have a discrete spectrum containing zero , they do not have an inverse .",
    "however , general methods of quantum geometry and loop quantum cosmology @xcite imply that there exist well - defined operators quantizing inverse triad components . to obtain these operators",
    "one makes use of a classical reformulation , e.g. @xmath80 which can then be quantized to @xmath81^{-2 } \\left({\\mathop{\\mathrm{tr}}}\\nolimits_j\\lambda_1^i\\tau_i h_1[h_1^{-1},\\sqrt{|\\hat{p}^1|}]\\right)^2\\,.\\ ] ] here we have indicated that there are quantization ambiguities @xcite when one quantizes composite operators .",
    "the one , most relevant for this paper , is indicated by the subscript @xmath82 of the trace and corresponds to the choice of representation while writing holonomies as multiplicative operators .",
    "this operator acts as @xmath83 the discrete values @xmath84 _ decrease toward lower values _ for @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "thus , one can see that the classical divergence of the inverse of @xmath28 at vanishing @xmath19 is explicitly absent in the quantized operator .",
    "this will be seen to have further consequences for the approach to the classical singularity .",
    "furthermore , the state @xmath67 with @xmath86 ( on which the classical inverse triad would diverge ) is actually annihilated by @xmath87 due to @xmath88 .",
    "this allows us to define the inverse triad operator ( not just its absolute value ) by @xmath89 without ambiguity in defining the sign of zero .",
    "these inverse triad operators will be used later to find well - defined operators quantizing the spin connection .",
    "their eigenvalues are @xmath90      since the classical hamiltonian constraint contains the structure constants , it must have a model dependent quantization . the procedure in the full theory @xcite",
    "motivates to model the holonomy of a closed loop by using the combination @xmath91 in order to quantize connection components in the constraint @xcite .",
    "this works in fact for the bianchi i model , but it must be modified for models with non - vanishing intrinsic curvature . in these models",
    "a curve which is formed from four pieces of integral curves of vector fields @xmath8 generating the symmetry action , which would have holonomy @xmath91 , does not close to form a loop .",
    "one needs a correction which in @xcite has been done by adding a holonomy for the remaining curve multiplicatively .",
    "however this does not result in an admissible evolution for the closed isotropic model derived from bianchi ix @xcite ( an admissible quantization for this model has recently been presented in @xcite ) .",
    "we thus have to find a quantization which satisfies certain criteria for a well - defined evolution .    to appreciate the criteria we recall that the general form of the hamiltonian constraint yields a _ difference _ equation for the wave function in the triad representation because of the action of holonomy operators @xcite .",
    "this fact is directly related to the discreteness of quantum geometry .",
    "however in the classical regime of large volume and small extrinsic curvature , the geometry is the familiar continuum ( metric ) geometry .",
    "thus the difference equation must admit solutions which can be very well approximated by solutions of _ differential _ equations , namely the wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation which comes from the ( schrodinger ) quantization of continuum geometry .",
    "such solutions are slowly varying ( in the classical regime ) and can be interpolated by slowly varying solutions of the wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation and are termed as _ pre - classical_. since quantum geometry depends on the barbero - immirzi parameter while the continuum geometry does not , absence of @xmath21 dependence in arriving at the differential approximation provides non - trivial constraints on the coefficients of the difference equation .",
    "admissibility of _ a continuum approximation _ is our first criterion .",
    "however , admissibility of a continuum approximation alone is not enough .",
    "typically the order of the difference equation is larger than that of the wheeler  dewitt equation .",
    "consequently there are solutions of the difference equation which are not interpolable by solutions of differential equation .",
    "therefore , if in some local region in the classical regime we have a  small \" admixture of these extra solutions ( small so that the continuum approximation is valid ) , there is no guarantee that contribution of the extra solutions remains small under subsequent evolution , i.e. the continuum approximation may get invalidated .",
    "that this does _ not _ happen is our second criterion .",
    "it is thus necessary for the _ stability _ of the continuum approximation .",
    "a detailed formulation of these criteria is given in @xcite .",
    "as a first step , one divides the classical regime ( large eigenvalues of the triad operators ) into smaller cells ( local regions ) which are still large compared to the order of the difference equation . in each of these cells , the coefficients of the difference equations",
    "are approximately constant .",
    "this leads to approximating the difference equation by an equation with constant coefficients . in the case of ordinary difference equations that result in the isotropic models ,",
    "the solutions are controlled by the roots of a polynomial .",
    "the admissibility of continuum approximation puts a set of conditions on these constant coefficients which translate into conditions on the roots . for the isotropic case in particular ,",
    "the criterion requires existence of a root with value 1 and multiplicity 2 .",
    "the second criterion of local stability further requires that all roots must have absolute value less than or equal to 1 in order to prevent exponential growth of the non - pre - classical solutions .",
    "a further complex conjugation property of the coefficients of the difference equations then implies that all roots in fact must have absolute value 1 .",
    "the quantization of the hamiltonian constraint presented in the next section will be shown to satisfy both these criteria .",
    "as noted in the introduction , models with non - vanishing intrinsic curvature must have non - zero spin connection which , thanks to homogeneity , can not be made to vanish .",
    "therefore , the ashtekar connection , a linear combination of the spin connection and the extrinsic curvature , is not necessarily small even in a semiclassical regime corresponding to small extrinsic curvature .",
    "while the hamiltonian constraint in quantum geometry is formulated naturally in terms of the connection , for a semiclassical approximation it is desirable to perform an expansion in the small extrinsic curvature .",
    "this can only lead to the correct result if the spin connection also appears explicitly in the constraint .",
    "we will first propose the quantized constraint operator , show how it reproduces the classical expression and heuristically argue how it can admit a continuum approximation with local stability .",
    "the properties of the proposed operator will be elaborated in detail in the following subsections .",
    "the proposed hamiltonian constraint operator is : @xmath92 \\right\\}~ \\right ] \\label{hop}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath93 \\label{gammaopr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the @xmath94 are defined in equation ( [ invtriad ] ) . since the inverse triad operators commute with the triad operators , there are no ordering ambiguities in the spin connection ( [ gammaopr ] ) .",
    "note that the holonomy operators @xmath95 appearing in the second set of braces do not need to contain the spin connection since it commutes with @xmath96 and would drop out .    in ( [ hop ] )",
    "the quantized spin connection appears explicitly both in the diagonal ` potential ' term and in holonomies @xmath97 . for vanishing @xmath32",
    "the constraint operator reproduces the one of the bianchi - i model @xcite .",
    "it is easy to see that the term @xmath98 comes from the curvature 2-form of the spin connection @xmath99 for a bianchi model .",
    "in fact , an expression via the curvature components would be more general since it could also be used for kantowski  sachs models .",
    "the holonomies @xmath97 are products of holonomies @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "since we have to choose a quantization of the spin connection components @xmath32 , which contain inverse triads , and also an ordering of the non - commuting @xmath102- and @xmath99-holonomies , there are many more quantization ambiguities compared to the bianchi - i model .",
    "however , qualitative effects can often be seen to be independent of such ambiguities .    to see that the proposed hamiltonian operator goes over to the classical expression in the classical limit",
    ", we can ignore the fact that connection components and the spin connection do not commute since this will only lead to effects of the order @xmath103 which disappear in the classical limit .",
    "the holonomy product @xmath104 can then be written formally as @xmath105 which for small @xmath106 yields @xmath107 on states ( [ n ] ) with large labels @xmath108 , the commutator containing the volume operator turns into @xmath109\\sim -{{\\textstyle \\frac{1}{2}}}i\\gamma{\\ell_{\\mathrm p}}^2 \\lambda_ka_k\\ ] ] so that the classical constraint in the form ( [ hh ] ) is reproduced .    with regard to the continuum approximation and the local stability conditions",
    ", we have to take into account the fact that the connection does not commute with the spin connection because even small terms can have significant effects should they lead to instabilities .",
    "the products of holonomies then do not depend on the differences @xmath110 only , as could be expected if they were to commute .",
    "while ignoring the non - commutativity we have seen that expressions like @xmath111 appear which , however , are not well - defined in this form since there do not exist @xmath14-operators in quantum geometry ( only holonomies of the ashtekar connection are well - defined operators )",
    ". motivated by the form of the holonomies in ( [ holonomyopr ] ) , @xmath112 we define @xmath113 and @xmath114 operators by @xmath115 with action @xmath116 and analogously for @xmath114-operators .",
    "this means that , by definition , the spin connection in trigonometric expressions of @xmath110 , always acts first . in the final expression we used eigenvalues @xmath117 of the spin connection operators , @xmath118    operators of the form ( [ sindiff ] )",
    "however , do not produce the basic difference operator in the triad representation since they contain the spin connection eigenvalues as coefficients .",
    "nevertheless , for large @xmath108 we have in the triad representation for a state @xmath69 @xmath119 where @xmath120 i.e. , @xmath121 for large @xmath108 , therefore , the operators ( [ sindiff ] ) do act as basic difference operators on the wave function @xmath122 up to phase factors , and analogously operators @xmath123 act as basic mean operators .    using the wave function @xmath122 instead of @xmath124 , the constraint operator ( [ hop ] )",
    "contains , besides diagonal ( potential ) terms , a sum of products of a basic difference operator and a basic mean operator for two of the three discrete parameters @xmath108 .",
    "the resulting difference equation for @xmath125 will thus be of the same form as the difference equation of the bianchi - i model .",

    "finally , the fact that we get a purely second order differential expressions is determined by the structure of the coefficients in the locally approximated difference equation @xcite .",

    "however , there is also a unique ordering for isotropic models @xcite which can be derived _",
    "after _ doing the reduction in loop quantum cosmology .",
    "our next requirement is about local stability of the evolution equation around pre - classical solutions .",
    "this is most directly formulated and illustrated in the context of an _ ordinary _ difference equation @xcite .",
    "the equation we have however is a _ partial _ difference equation .",
    "although , we do get a partial difference equation with constant coefficients in a local approximation , their solutions are not as easily analyzable in terms of roots of some polynomial . nevertheless , the property of local stability can still be analyzed .",
    "since we have three @xmath108 s , even if all are taken to be large , it is possible to have a subset of them to be much larger compared to the remaining ones . to begin with",
    ", we consider a neighborhood of a point where all @xmath108 are large and of the same order ; other regions can be explored similarly .",
    "for @xmath21 we assume the value derived from black hole entropy calculations which is of order @xmath205 .",
    "since all @xmath108 s are large , it follows exactly as before , that @xmath32 are given by the equation ( [ gamasy ] ) and all phases cancel out giving the locally approximated difference equation ( [ asy ] ) .",
    "furthermore , since we assume the @xmath108 to be about the same size , the @xmath32 are approximately equal and taking the bianchi ix model for definiteness , @xmath206 .",
    "we obtain @xmath207    in this equation , @xmath208 and @xmath209 all play the same role , but without loss of generality we can select @xmath209 to be the evolution parameter in terms of which we analyze local stability . to express it clearly ,",
    "let us introduce the notation @xmath210 which allows us to write the equation as @xmath211 where @xmath212 is a small constant ( in the local approximation ) characterizing the size of the matter contribution .    for @xmath108 s of the same order @xmath213",
    ", the equation can be further simplified as @xmath214    we are interested in checking if perturbation of slowly varying ( along all three directions ) solutions , continue to remain as perturbations under the @xmath209-evolution . to this end , we assume that we have some fixed solution which is slowly varying .",
    "then the first bracket on the right hand side is small while the second one is suppressed by @xmath215 ( @xmath216 is small even for large @xmath213 because the energy density decreases at least as @xmath217 ) .",
    "this is a linear equation among four combinations analogous to the equation of a plane in @xmath218 passing close to the origin .",
    "it can be solved approximately by introducing three , fixed orthonormal vectors , @xmath219 , each of which is orthogonal to the vector @xmath220 in @xmath218 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath221 in the above , corrections of the order @xmath222 as well as of the order @xmath223 are ignored and @xmath224 are three functions of @xmath209 . the @xmath224 can be assumed to be small for @xmath225 to represent a solution close to a pre - classical one .    thus we obtain ordinary , _ non - homogeneous _ difference equations with constant coefficients for the four @xmath226 .",
    "all the equations have the same structure , and their solutions consist of a combination of the particular solution and linear combinations of solutions of the corresponding homogeneous equations .",
    "the _ difference _ between a perturbed solution and the fixed solution of course satisfies the _ homogeneous _ equations .",
    "the local stability now requires that these differences do not grow exponentially .",
    "equivalently , the characteristic roots for the homogeneous equations must have absolute value less than or equal to one .",
    "in our case , the characteristic polynomials are the same for all four equations namely , @xmath227 , with roots equal to @xmath228 .",
    "these obviously satisfy the condition of local stability .    because of local stability , perturbations of slowly varying solutions continue to remain close to them under evolution along the @xmath209 direction .",
    "this also ensures _",
    "self - consistency _ when we consider evolutions along the @xmath208 directions in a similar manner by keeping the corresponding right hand sides close to zero .",
    "had we not neglected the terms on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ approxeqn ] ) , we would have got an extra , common non - homogeneous term which is 1/2 of the right hand side of eq.([approxeqn ] ) .",
    "clearly , this does not affect the behavior of the differences .    to summarize ,",
    "although we got a partial difference equation , we were able to implement the idea behind the local stability criterion by obtaining a system of ordinary difference equations . that these equations are non - homogeneous , does not affect the stability properties @xcite .",
    "we have now verified that the proposed quantization ( [ hop ] ) has a valid continuum approximation and is locally stable around pre - classical solutions .",
    "thus , it is possible to start with initial data at large volume which are close to a continuum solution and to follow the evolution to smaller volume , toward the classical singularity . in this regime ,",
    "quantum effects of the discreteness and also ordering issues become more and more important and the full equation has to be considered without approximations .",
    "fortunately , it is possible to see essential features of the absence of singularities quite generally in a way similar to the isotropic case @xcite . since the constraint equation is used as a recurrence relation for the wave function , the term with lowest order in the labels @xmath108 should have non - vanishing coefficient , except when one of the labels vanishes such that the corresponding component of the wave function , i.e.  its value at singular surfaces in minisuperspace , will drop out ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "it can readily be verified that this general behavior is true for the evolution equation of an arbitrary bianchi class a model .",
    "the difference equation resulting from ( [ hop ] ) is more complicated than in the isotropic @xcite or bianchi i @xcite case ; but since the exponentiated spin connection never vanishes and the additional potential term containing the spin connection is diagonal , only the commutator of holonomies with the volume operator determines whether or not a lowest order coefficient vanishes .",
    "the structure resulting from this term is the same as in the bianchi i case , and thus the evolution is singularity - free in the same way .",
    "this shows that the wave function can be extended uniquely from the region of minisuperspace with positive orientation to the region with negative orientation and that the orientation again provides us with a branch ` before ' the classical singularity .    for bianchi models other than bianchi i",
    ", however , the _ classical approach to the singularity _ is more complicated than the simpler kasner behavior .",
    "this is most dramatic in the bianchi ix model where different kasner epochs succeed each other infinitely many times .",
    "it turns out , as we will discuss in the next section , that the classical approach to singularities is modified at small scales by quantum geometry effects which is expected to lead to a simpler picture .      even after imposing the condition of local stability",
    "the constraint expression is far from being unique .",
    "there may be other choices for the kinetic term which lead to a locally stable behavior , but they would have to be very special and difficult to find .",
    "the advantage of the quantization presented here is that it is rather simple and provides a general formula for all diagonal bianchi class a models at once without having to find an expression in each case separately .",
    "as for factor ordering ambiguities , the main issue is that of ordering the commutator to the right or to the left .",
    "this ordering is the same here as in the bianchi i case and also in the full theory .",
    "thus , the special issues one has to deal with in models with non - vanishing intrinsic curvature do not change this result .",
    "since the non - singular evolution depends significantly on this kind of ordering , it is robust .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to prove the existence of one quantization for all models in our class which has the correct semiclassical limit , results in a locally stable evolution and is also non - singular in the quantum regime .",
    "that such a general quantization fulfilling all the different requirements exists is a non - trivial fact and provides a further check of the methods employed in the full theory .    the second issue , besides the singularity - free evolution , which is robust under the choices we have is the semiclassical behavior and corrections to it .",
    "the main effects in this context are insensitive to factor ordering and other choices .",
    "as we will discuss in the next section , there are non - perturbative effects coming from the potential term which lead to drastic differences to the classical behavior .",
    "since they come from the potential term and are based on general features of quantizations of inverse triad components , they have to be present in any quantization .",
    "the quantization ( [ hop ] ) of the hamiltonian constraint yields consistent quantizations of the dynamics of bianchi class a models which in the limit of large triad components reproduce the correct classical behavior . at finite values of @xmath19 , however , there are always correction terms to the classical equations of motion ( [ motion ] ) which can change the classical evolution .",
    "it is possible to derive different types of corrections and to include them in effective classical equations of motion .",
    "there are the following sources of correction terms : first , we can keep more terms beyond the leading order in a taylor expansion of difference operators which results in a higher order wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation .",
    "these correction terms would correspond to higher curvature terms in an effective action .",
    "the second source is the non - commutativity of the @xmath102-holonomy @xmath100 and the @xmath99-holonomy @xmath229 in ( [ hop ] ) .",
    "since we have , for example , @xmath230 which in a quantization would appear as the diagonal operator @xmath231 \\ , \\ ] ] the coefficients of the wheeler  dewitt equation receive corrections of the order @xmath232 .",
    "thirdly , we have to use well - defined inverse metric operators when we quantize the spin connection components in ( [ hop ] ) which leads to a modified behavior at small scales ( as in the isotropic case where it implies inflation @xcite ) .",
    "since the last effect is non - perturbative while the first two are perturbative ( in @xmath21 ) , it can be expected to have the most dramatic consequences .",
    "therefore , we will focus on this type of correction in our discussion of a modified approach to classical singularities . as in @xcite",
    ", we exploit the fact that there are quantization ambiguities @xcite which can extend the range of a modified classical behavior @xcite . if we choose the ambiguity parameter large enough it is reasonable to use effective classical equations of motion to describe the trajectory of a quantum wave packet while still experiencing the modified behavior at small scales .",
    "in particular , the spin connection components will always decrease when we approach the classical singularity close enough whereas they always have some diverging components in the purely classical scenario .",
    "the diverging components lead to infinitely high walls in the potential ( [ potential ] ) on minisuperspace and to an infinite number of reflections in the bianchi ix model leading to chaotic behavior @xcite . with the modified spin connection",
    ", the walls do not grow arbitrarily high but instead shrink once a small triad component is reached .",
    "consequently , one expects that the reflections will cease after a finite number of times and the wave packet will simply move through the classical singularity in a final kasner epoch .    here",
    ", we will make this explicit by deriving the potential and its changes due to the modified spin connection .",

    "initially , therefore , part of the guidance from the full theory is lost and there are more ambiguities when one quantizes the hamiltonian constraint .    in @xcite two conditions which have to be imposed for a reasonable quantization , have been introduced and discussed in detail .",
    "these stem primarily from the requirement that the loop quantization admit physical states which , in a semiclassical regime , have much less sensitivity to variations on the planck scale so that the idealization of the continuum geometric formulation is well justified .",
    "this has been made more explicit by the formulation of the continuum approximation .",
    "in section [ hami ] we introduced a quantization of the hamiltonian constraint for all diagonalized bianchi class a models , and showed that the two conditions are satisfied .",
    "it was important to take the freedom of phases in the triad representation into account which we did by transforming to a new wave function @xmath122 in ( [ stilde ] ) .",

    "dewitt quantization based on the metric variables . since the two sets of basic variables differ significantly only when the spin connection is non - zero which happens when the intrinsic curvature is non - zero , non - trivial phases show up in this situation .",
    "the same transformation then appears whether one uses a loop quantization or a schrdinger quantization in the connection formulation and compares with the wheeler ",
    "dewitt quantization .",
    "we also showed that the mechanism for the absence of singularities continues to hold , despite the phases , exactly as in the case of the bianchi - i model @xcite .",
    "thus , as the main result of this paper we proved that for all diagonal bianchi class a models there is a loop quantization which satisfies all the conditions for a good continuum limit as well as that of a singularity - free evolution .",
    "that such a quantization exists at all , and even one which provides a general form for all the models , is a non - trivial fact and gives further credence to the viability of loop methods and the physical applications obtained so far .",
    "in section [ bianchiix ] we carried out a preliminary exploration of the consequences of the quantized spin connection and the correspondingly modified potential .",
    "we focused on the bianchi ix case and pointed out that unlike the classical potential which has infinite walls as the singularity is approached , the quantum modified potential has finite walls .",
    "since the infinite walls are responsible for the chaotic approach to the singularity , we expect that the finite walls of the modified potential will significantly alter the approach to the classical singularity @xcite .",
    "finally a remark about the relevance of the results is in order . since the connection of the quantization discussed here to the full theory is weaker , it is legitimate to question what this quantization may have to do with the full theory .",
    "firstly , we observe that the methods adopted as well as the two admissibility criteria work uniformly for all homogeneous models ( including isotropic sub - models ) which do not have a non - zero spin connection . the direct loss of connection to the full theory is only in the models with spin connection .",
    "the treatment of the spin connection enters in two distinct places , firstly in using the inverses of triad components and secondly in the modification of holonomies .",
    "the first one is quite natural and inherits the ambiguities in the definition of inverses @xcite .",
    "the second one has additional ambiguities due to factor ordering .",
    "it is already clear that the first type of ambiguity is _ not _ fixed by the two admissibility criteria .",
    "our emphasis in this work has been to demonstrate the existence of _ a uniform method _ of quantization which satisfies the two admissibility criteria _ and _ is singularity free .",
    "the uniqueness type of issues , while important , requires a systematic classification of possible ambiguities and is beyond the scope of the present work . likewise",
    "the general question of how many of the results of a minisuperspace quantization can survive the full theory is also beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "while the spin connection is seen to require a careful treatment of the continuum approximation and also to lead to a modified approach to the bkl singularity in the context of homogeneous models , its role in the full theory is more complicated and is an open issue .",
    "for instance , the phase factor in @xmath122 which has the form , @xmath263 is not even well - defined in the full theory due to the transformation properties of the spin connection ( which is no longer a covariant object ) .",
    "since the spin connection can be made arbitrarily small locally , by choosing appropriate coordinates , one can expect that the diffeomorphism constraint and its algebra with the hamiltonian constraint will play a role in this issue .",
    "requirements such as the local stability condition can also be expected to play a role in analyzing this issue , at least with a local version in the absence of a global internal time .",
