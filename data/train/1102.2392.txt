    "in recent years there is an increasing interest in using continuous variable entangled states in applications of quantum information processing and communication @xcite .",
    "a full characterization of the nonclassical properties of entangled states of continuous variable systems exists , at present , only for the class of gaussian states . in this special case there exist necessary and sufficient criteria of entanglement @xcite and quantitative entanglement measures @xcite .",
    "the quantum information processing tasks are difficult to implement , due to the fact that any realistic quantum system is not isolated and it always interacts with its environment . quantum coherence and entanglement of quantum systems",
    "are inevitably influenced during their interaction with the external environment . as a result of the irreversible and uncontrollable phenomenon of quantum decoherence ,",
    "the purity and entanglement of quantum states are in most cases degraded . therefore in order to describe realistically quantum information processes it is necessary to take decoherence and dissipation into consideration .",
    "decoherence and dynamics of quantum entanglement in continuous variable open systems have been intensively studied in the last years @xcite .",
    "when two systems are immersed in an environment , then , in addition to and at the same time with the quantum decoherence phenomenon , the environment can also generate a quantum entanglement of the two systems and therefore an additional mechanism to correlate them @xcite .",
    "paz and roncaglia @xcite also analyzed the entanglement properties of two oscillators in a common environment by using the exact master equation for quantum brownian motion and showed that the entanglement can undergo three qualitatively different dynamical phases : sudden death , sudden death and revival , and no sudden death of entanglement .",
    "in this paper we study , in the framework of the theory of open systems based on completely positive quantum dynamical semigroups , the dynamics of the continuous variable entanglement of two identical harmonic oscillators coupled to a common thermal environment .",
    "we are interested in discussing the correlation effect of the environment , therefore we assume that the two oscillators are uncoupled , i.e. they do not interact directly .",
    "the initial state of the subsystem is taken of gaussian form and the evolution under the quantum dynamical semigroup assures the preservation in time of the gaussian form of the state . in section 2",
    "we write the markovian master equation in the heisenberg representation for two uncoupled harmonic oscillators interacting with a general environment and the evolution equation for the covariance matrix of the considered subsystem . by using the peres - simon criterion for separability of two - mode gaussian states",
    "@xcite , we investigate in section 3 the dynamics of entanglement for this system .",
    "we show that for certain values of the environment temperature , the state keeps for all times its initial type : separable or entangled . for",
    "other values of the temperature , entanglement generation , entanglement sudden death or a repeated collapse and revival of entanglement take place .",
    "we analyze also the time evolution of the logarithmic negativity , which characterizes the degree of entanglement of the quantum state .",
    "a summary is given in section 4 .",
    "we study the dynamics of the subsystem composed of two identical non - interacting oscillators in weak interaction with a thermal environment . in the axiomatic formalism based on completely positive quantum dynamical semigroups , the irreversible time evolution of an open system",
    "is described by the following general quantum markovian master equation for an operator @xmath0 in the heisenberg representation ( @xmath1 denotes hermitian conjugation ) @xcite : @xmath2+{1\\over 2\\hbar}\\sum_j(v_j^{\\dagger}[a , v_j]+[v_j^{\\dagger},a]v_j).\\label{masteq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath3 denotes the hamiltonian of the open system and the operators @xmath4 defined on the hilbert space of @xmath5 represent the interaction of the open system with the environment .",
    "we are interested in the set of gaussian states , therefore we introduce such quantum dynamical semigroups that preserve this set during time evolution of the system . consequently @xmath3 is taken to be a polynomial of second degree in the coordinates @xmath6 and momenta @xmath7 of the oscillators and @xmath8 are taken polynomials of first degree in these canonical observables . then in the linear space spanned by coordinates and momenta there exist only four linearly independent operators @xmath9 @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 are complex coefficients .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath3 of the two uncoupled identical harmonic oscillators of mass @xmath12 and frequency @xmath13 is given by @xmath14    the fact that the evolution is given by a dynamical semigroup implies the positivity of the matrix formed by the scalar products of the four vectors @xmath15 whose entries are the components @xmath16 respectively .",
    "we take this matrix of the following form , where all diffusion coefficients @xmath17 ... and dissipation constant @xmath18 are real quantities ( we put from now on @xmath19 ) : @xmath20 it follows that the principal minors of this matrix are positive or zero . from the cauchy - schwarz inequality",
    "the following relations hold for the coefficients defined in ( [ coef ] ) : @xmath21    we introduce the following @xmath22 bimodal covariance matrix : @xmath23 the problem of solving the master equation for the operators in heisenberg representation can be transformed into a problem of solving first - order in time , coupled linear differential equations for the covariance matrix elements .",
    "namely , from ( [ masteq ] ) we obtain the following system of equations for the quantum correlations of the canonical observables , written in matrix form @xcite ( @xmath24 denotes a transposed matrix ) : @xmath25 where @xmath26 @xmath27 the time - dependent solution of ( [ vareq ] ) is given by @xcite @xmath28 m^{\\rm t}(t)+\\sigma(\\infty),\\label{covart}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the matrix @xmath29 has to fulfill the condition @xmath30 in order that this limit exists , @xmath31 must only have eigenvalues with negative real parts .",
    "the values at infinity are obtained from the equation @xmath32",
    "the characterization of the separability of continuous variable states using second - order moments of quadrature operators was given in refs .",
    "a gaussian state is separable if and only if the partial transpose of its density matrix is non - negative [ necessary and sufficient positive partial transpose ( ppt ) criterion ] .",
    "a two - mode gaussian state is entirely specified by its covariance matrix ( [ covar ] ) , which is a real , symmetric and positive matrix with the block structure @xmath33 where @xmath0 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are @xmath36 hermitian matrices . @xmath0 and @xmath34 denote the symmetric covariance matrices for the individual one - mode states , while the matrix @xmath35 contains the cross - correlations between modes .",

    "concretely , we have to analyze the time evolution of the simon function @xmath43 ( [ sim1 ] ) . for a thermal environment characterized by the temperature @xmath44 we consider such diffusion coefficients , for which @xmath45 this corresponds to the case when the asymptotic state is a gibbs state @xcite .    for gaussian states ,",
    "the measures of entanglement of bipartite systems are based on some invariants constructed from the elements of the covariance matrix @xcite . in order to quantify the degrees of entanglement of the infinite - dimensional bipartite system states of the two oscillators",
