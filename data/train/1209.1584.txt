    "in the last twelve years there has been a rapid development of the so - called fokas method for boundary value problems @xcite .",
    "this method was initially developed for the study of boundary value problems associated with integrable nonlinear pdes @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the method has proved an extremely powerful tool in the study of linear boundary value problems @xcite and has offered new avenues of pursuit in the numerical study of such problems @xcite .",
    "the fokas method can be informally considered as the fourier analogue of the classical boundary integral methods @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the analysis is done in the  physical \" space  i.e. the space associated with the domain on which the boundary value problem is posed . in the fokas approach",
    "the analysis is done in  spectral \" space and the classical boundary integral equations are replaced with the _ global relation_. like the usual boundary integral equations from potential theory , the global relation gives a relationship between the known boundary data and the unknown boundary values for a given pde .",
    "however , the form of the integral equation is very different : the global relation has meromorphic dependence on a spectral parameter which plays the analogue of the wave number in fourier analysis .",
    "the dirichlet and neumann terms that arise in boundary integral equations have spectral analogues that arise in the global relation .",
    "the fact that the spectral boundary data has meromorphic dependence on the spectral parameter allows for use of powerful tools from complex analysis and this salient feature is one of the core reasons behind the success of the fokas method .",
    "another major ingredient in the fokas approach is the use of novel integral representations . by formulating and solving riemann - hilbert problems related to the underlying boundary value problem",
    ", fokas has developed a means of representing the solution to many important problems .",
    "these integral representations are intimately related to the classical _ fundamental principle _ of ehrenpreis and palamodov @xcite .",
    "a direct consequence of this highly abstract result is that any solution to a constant coefficient pde on a convex domain can be written as a superposition of exponential solutions . more concretely , if @xmath0 is a constant coefficient differential operator and @xmath1 in a convex domain in @xmath2 , then the fundamental principle states that @xmath3 can be represented in the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 is a polynomial in @xmath7 such that @xmath8 for @xmath9 solves @xmath1 .",
    "this theorem is highly abstract and non - constructive .",
    "the result states that _ there exists _ a measure @xmath10 supported on @xmath11 and a collection of exponential solutions @xmath12 such that the representation holds .",
    "fokas novel integral representations are realisations of this abstract result  providing an explicit expression that is precisely a superposition of exponential solutions .",
    "these integral representations must , of course , contain terms relating to the known boundary data .",
    "the novelty lies in the fact that these terms arise in the same form as they do in the global relation .",
    "this means there should be no need to go back and fourth between physical space and spectral space ",
    "it is sufficient to understand the global relation in spectral space and give the solution in terms of integrals of spectral functions by means of the novel integral representation .",
    "the implementation of the fokas method has been largely formal in nature .",
    "one usually works on the assumption that a solution to the underlying problem exists and aims to construct it by analysing the global relation .",
    "this assumption can then be checked _ a posteriori_. recently more rigorous results",
    "have been obtained @xcite . in this paper",
    "we continue to address rigorous aspects of the fokas approach .",
    "we concern ourselves with the particular case of laplace s equation in a convex polygon . for dirichlet data with square integrable tangential derivatives along the edges of @xmath13 , we prove the following results ( more precise versions of which can be found in theorems [ dncts ] , [ laxmilgram ] and their corollaries )    a.   the global relation defines a continuous linear map from the spectral dirichlet data to the spectral neumann data .",
    "b.   the resulting physical neumann data is square integrable along each edge . c.   the global relation gives rise to an infinite family of well - posed weak problems that are easily approximated using standard galerkin techniques .    as a corollary to statements @xmath14@xmath15 we get a new proof of existence for the classical dirichlet problem in a convex polygon for boundary data in @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the statement in @xmath17 is in accordance with the well known regularity of the steklov - poincare operator on lipschitz domains @xcite . in proving @xmath15",
    "we provide a basis from which the previous numerical studies @xcite can be made rigorous .",
    "the methods presented here can easily be adapted to deal with the neumann boundary value problem . in this case",
    "similar statements @xmath14@xmath15 hold , but with the dirichlet data being determined modulo constants .",
    "the approach we use is far removed from the classical methods boundary integral and more modern pseudodifferential methods .",
    "the analysis takes place banach space of complex analytic functions and the main ingredients in our proofs are complex analytic in nature , utilising the classical theorems of liouville , montel , phragmn and lindelf .",
    "we work on a polygon @xmath18 with vertices @xmath19 and sides @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "we write @xmath22 for the angle the side @xmath23 makes with the positive real axis and @xmath24 .",
    "also set @xmath25 for the length of the side @xmath23 .",
    "we are given real valued boundary data @xmath26 for @xmath27 , meaning that @xmath28 and its first tangential derivative are square integrable along the edge @xmath23 .",
    "we are interested in the dirichlet - neumann map associated with the classical dirichlet problem @xmath29 that is to say , we want to reconstruct the unknown neumann boundary values from the known dirichlet boundary data .    in practical applications",
    "the more physically relevant quantity in @xmath30 is the gradient field , @xmath31 , or equivalently the complex derivative @xmath32 with @xmath33 . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that any solution to has an integral representation @xmath34 where the spectral functions @xmath35 are defined by @xmath36 and the @xmath37 are rays in the complex plane orientated out towards infinity with @xmath38 .",
    "the spectral functions satisfy the global relation @xmath39 note that the spectral functions contain information about the known boundary data @xmath40 _ and _ the unknown boundary values since @xmath41 involves derivatives in the tangential and normal directions along @xmath23",
    ". we can interpret as a formal solution to @xmath30 if we assume the spectral functions satisfy the global relation . our aim is to solve for the unknown parts of the spectral functions which contain information about the unknown normal derivatives .",
    "it was shown in @xcite ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) that on the assumption that the global relation is satisfied , the integral representation provides a solution to the boundary value problem @xmath30 .",
    "this is important from both the theoretical and practical point of view ",
    "it means that solving the global relation for the unknown parts of the spectral functions is equivalent to solving the boundary value problem @xmath30 . by describing the global relation as a map between function spaces for the spectral functions , we are able to provide existence , uniqueness and stability results for the solution to the global relation .",
    "perhaps more importantly , this gives a means for the practical numerical solution to the global relation for the unknown parts of the spectral functions .",

    "choosing @xmath249 sufficiently large we find @xmath310 this contradicts our assumption that @xmath311 , so the estimate in must hold .",
    "coercivity @xmath312 follows directly from @xmath313 that @xmath275 defines a bounded linear map on @xmath114 follows from arguments similar to those used to prove estimate @xmath314 .",

    "using this approximation one evaluates the global relation at a sequence of points in the complex plane to get linear problem for the unknown coefficients @xmath319 .",

    "the main arguments presented here _ can _ be carried over to the higher dimensional problems .",
