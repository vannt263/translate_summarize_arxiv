    "quantum walks ( qws )  @xcite are especially interesting because of their importance in quantum algorithms research  @xcite and also because they represent an intriguing quantum version of the ubiquitous classical phenomenon of random walks ( rws ) .",
    "originally conceived as a single walker whose left or right step on a line is entangled with the outcome of flipping a single two - sided quantum coin , the qw has been extended to more general cases of higher - dimensional walks  @xcite , multiple walkers and/or multiple coins  @xcite .",
    "these generalizations enable exploration of qws in complex settings , which could connect with real - world phenomena such as transport in photosynthetic protein complexes  @xcite .",
    "additionally the inclusion of more walkers and/or coins can efficiently enlarge the hilbert space being explored because a linear increase in degrees of freedom exponentially enlarges the hilbert space .    here",
    "we explore the complex case of two walkers each carrying and ( quantumly ) flipping separate coins but with the freedom to swap partially the coins between flips .",
    "by partial swapping we mean that the two walkers can effect the unitary operation swap@xmath0 on their coins : for @xmath1 , this corresponds to no swapping whatsoever so the two walkers evolve completely independently , and the other extreme is @xmath2 corresponding to completely swapping the coins after every step . for  @xmath3 a consequence of full or partial",
    "swapping is to cause entanglement between the walkers position and coin degrees of freedom . classically swapping coins does not change the walker dynamics because each coin flip is random , but quantumly the effect of swapping is important because of the unitary dynamics .",
    "partial or full swapping of coins is interesting as this simple procedure turns independent qws into entangled qws .",
    "as multi - walker qws could occur in nature , our work suggests new phenomena to explore in qw behavior .",
    "although we focus on the two - walker case , the multiple - walker case can be obtained by a natural extension of our foundational work on this area . full and partial",
    "swapping of coins between independent qwers is also appealing practically as an implementation .",
    "each independent walker s can correspond to the phase of a cavity field , and each walker s two - sided coin is an atom in the cavity with a superposition of ground and excited electronic energy states coupled to the cavity via a dispersive nonlinear phase shift  @xcite .",
    "the atoms can interact via a dipole - dipole interaction  @xcite between ( or during ) steps , and the strength of this dipole - dipole interaction determines the value of  @xmath4 .",
    "two - walker qws are compared to two - walker rws by examining the joint position distributions of the two walkers after tracing out the coin states .",
    "classically , for any value of  @xmath4 , no correlation is expected and the diffusion of position is marked by its spread  @xmath5 ( standard deviation of the position distribution ) increasing as  @xmath6 for  @xmath7 the elapsed time ( which can be expressed as a continuous or a discrete quantity and is the discrete number of steps in our study ) .",
    "quantum walks can be distinguished by ballistic spreading , where the @xmath5 grows linearly with @xmath7  @xcite or by anderson - type localization where the walker s spread becomes constant at large  @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "this localization effect is due to the walker effectively becoming trapped due to irregularities of the spacing of the lattice traversed by the walker .",
    "thus , there are three domains of spreading in the asymptotic large  @xmath7 limit : ballistic ( @xmath8 ) , diffusive ( @xmath9 ) and localized  ( @xmath10constant ) .    here",
    "we are interested not only in how the walker s position spreads but also in the correlations between two walkers positions after tracing out the coins . to study the correlations , we go beyond evaluating joint position distributions for different values of  @xmath7 to studying two - time correlation functions .",
    "such correlation functions prove to be quite useful for studying two - walker dynamics with partial coin swapping .",
    "for a single - walker qw on a line , the hilbert space is @xmath11 with the walker hilbert space  @xmath12 spanned by the orthogonal lattice position vectors  @xmath13 and @xmath14 the two - dimensional coin space spanned by two orthogonal vectors which we denote  @xmath15 .",
    "each step by the walker is effected by two subsequent unitary operators : the coin - flip operator @xmath16 for  @xmath17 the hadamard matrix and the conditional - translation operator @xmath18 the resultant step operator is @xmath19 with  @xmath20 the identity operator on  @xmath12 .",
    "the choice of initial state  @xmath21 is important in studies of qws because the interference features sensitively depend on the choice of state .",
    "this sensitivity is persistent because the dynamics are unitary hence do not die out . on the other hand the general properties of qws do not depend on the choice of initial state so the choice of initial state is not crucial provided that the focus is on such characterization .",
    "as we are interested in general properties , the initial state is not important so we choose the initial product state with the walker at the origin of the two - dimensional lattice and hold separate coins in an equal superposition of the  @xmath22 and  @xmath23 states : @xmath24    the differences between qws and rws are due to interference effects ( or entanglement ) between coin and walkers after several applications of @xmath25 ( with the number of applications  @xmath7 being the discrete time variable ) .",
    "we perform a measurement at some point in order to know the outcome of the walk .",
    "the measurement of the walker s position corresponds to the projection - valued measure @xmath26 resulting in the walker s state ` collapsing ' to position  @xmath27 on the lattice .",
    "after  @xmath7 steps , the final state of the system is  @xmath28 .",
    "the reduced state of the walker is obtained by tracing out the coin .",
    "the probability @xmath29 that the walker will be found at the position  @xmath27 is @xmath30 which is obtained by tracing out the coin of the walker - coin state and then measuring the walker s position .",
    "we can characterize @xmath29 by the moments of this position distribution  @xmath31 .",
    "the mean  @xmath32 and variance @xmath33 can be used as the measure of qws and show the signature of qws compared to rws . for a rw , the position variance @xmath34 , which is characteristic of diffusive motion ,",
    "whereas , for a qw , a quadratic enhancement is achieved : the position variance  @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "the extension to two independent quantum walkers is straightforward .",
    "the new hilbert space is  @xmath36 , and the step operator is @xmath37 .",
    "the walkers evolve independently of each other . to entangle the walkers and their respective coins together , we change the step operator from @xmath37 to @xmath38 for @xmath39 expressed in the basis that naturally extends from the single - walker case via the tensor product of hilbert spaces .",
    "the full initial state of the two - walker system is @xmath40 ( each walker is initially localized at the origin of their respective lines ) .",
    "after  @xmath7 steps , the final state of the two - walker+coins system is @xmath41 with  @xmath42 .",
    "we now follow the evolution by performing a fourier transform of the evolution operator to the `` momentum ''  @xmath43 space .",
    "the eigenvectors @xmath44 of  @xmath45 and @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : s ] ) have the eigenrelations @xmath47 for  @xmath43 a continuous real quantity .",
    "the inverse transformation is @xmath48 each walker is initialized at the origin of the line so each walker s initial state is @xmath49 in the  @xmath50 and  @xmath51 bases for the two wakers , where  @xmath52 is a continuous index for the momentum of the second walker , the evolution operator becomes @xmath53 with  @xmath54 the coin state and @xmath55 where @xmath56 the  @xmath43 and  @xmath52 subscripts are of course the continuous walker - momentum eigenvalues .",
    "the general density operator for the initial state of the system in the @xmath43 basis can be expressed as @xmath57 the final state after @xmath7 steps is @xmath58 in terms of the superoperator @xmath59 , @xmath60    the walkers positions are on a two - dimensional integer lattice labeled  @xmath61 with the initial position localized at  @xmath62 .",
    "measurement of the first walker s position corresponds to the projection - valued measure  @xmath63 on the two - walker reduced state ( after tracing out the coins ) , and the second walker s position measurement is @xmath64 .",
    "joint measurement of the two walkers positions corresponds to the projection - valued measure @xmath65 acting on the reduced two - walker state .",
    "the joint position distribution  @xmath66 of finding the first walker at  @xmath27 and the second at  @xmath67 is @xmath68 at time  @xmath7 where @xmath69 is the state of the two walkers obtained by tracing out the coins .",
    "thus the position distribution of each walker at position  @xmath27 ( the case for  @xmath67 is similar ) is obtained by tracing out the states of the two coins and the other walker @xmath70    the variance of the position distribution is especially important . for standard qws with single walkers , the variance of the position distribution has been shown to evolve according to  @xmath71 , whereas  @xmath8 for rws .",
    "this quadratic speedup of spreading in a unitary evolution is a hallmark of the qw on a line . for our case , namely qws with two walkers switching their coin partially for each step",
    ", the variance of each walker distribution can still be used to qualify the quantum behavior of this kind walks .",
    "if we trace out the second walker , the reduced density matrix is @xmath72 the sum can be exactly carried out in terms of derivatives of the @xmath73 function : @xmath74 inserting this result back into the expression of the reduced density matrix yields @xmath75 the probability for the first walker to reach a point @xmath27 at time @xmath7 is @xmath76 thus we can calculate the moments of this distribution : @xmath77 for the first moment , we obtain @xmath78 where @xmath79",

    "the first and second moments of the distribution behave as same as those for the standard hadamard walk .",
    "that is , @xmath81 is linear dependent on  @xmath7 , while @xmath82 is quadratic dependent on  @xmath7 .    for @xmath83 , @xmath84 is still unitary . for short time , the moments of the position distribution behave similarly to those for standard unitary walk . in the long - time limit",
    "we can solve the moments of distribution analytically .",
    "suppose @xmath85 is a linear transformation and all the eigenvalues satisfy @xmath86 .",
    "we drop the terms that will be zero at large  @xmath7 from the expressions for the moments .    as @xmath85 is linear ,",

    "classically the walkers can swap their coins or not , or they could swap their coins sometimes , either deterministically or probabilistically . in our two - walker fractional - coin - swapping scenario , a fractional coin swap is effected after every step identically . classically one would expect that coin swapping would not affect the dynamics anyway because the coin state is unimportant : the flip chooses a random outcome .",
    "our classical understanding of coin swapping thus gives little intuition about the quantum case .",

    "<S> we consider two independent quantum walks on separate lines augmented by partial or full swapping of coins after each step . for classical random walks , swapping or not swapping coins makes little difference to the random walk characteristics , but we show that quantum walks with partial swapping of coins have complicated yet elegant inter - walker correlations . </S>",
    "<S> specifically we study the joint position distribution of the reduced two - walker state after tracing out the coins and analyze total , classical and quantum correlations in terms of mutual information , quantum mutual information , and measurement - induced disturbance . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shows intriguing quantum features without classical analogues . </S>"
