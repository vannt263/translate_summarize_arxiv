    "x - ray surveys of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) have revealed that the cosmological evolution of agn luminosity function is well described by the luminosity - dependent density evolution characterized by `` down - sizing '' , where the low - luminosity agns show the peak of their comoving space density at lower redshift than that of high - luminosity ones ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is being confirmed by optical agn surveys of unobscured agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this fact suggests that the growth history of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) may fundamentally differ between the low mass and high mass smbh - galaxy systems in the present - day universe .",
    "thus , it is quite interesting to investigate the nature of low - luminosity agns ( llagns ) in comparison with more luminous populations .",
    "despite their abundance in the space density , however , the detailed study of _ broad band _ x - ray spectra of llagns has been limited due to their faint nature ( for previous works below 10 kev , see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    observed agn properties strongly depend on the luminosities in many aspects .",
    "in particular , it is known that the obscured ( type-2 ) fraction of agns shows strong anti - correlation with luminosity ( for x - ray selected samples see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicating that the covering fraction of obscuring material around a smbh is smaller in more luminous agns .",
    "recent studies based on hard x - ray ( @xmath8kev ; @xcite ) and mid - infrared @xcite",
    "selected samples suggest that this relation is more complex when llagns are included .",
    "the obscured fraction has a peak of @xmath90.60.8 around the 1555 kev luminosity ( hereafter @xmath10 ) of @xmath11 ergs s@xmath1 below which it starts to decrease toward lower luminosity , although the sample size of llagns is quite limited . to understand the agn phenomena in a unified way over the wide range of luminosity , it is crucial to establish the trend and reveal the origin .",
    "broad band x - ray data are useful to constrain the geometry of surrounding material around the smbh as well as physics of the inner accretion disk .",
    "the _ suzaku _",
    "satellite @xcite has unique capability to simultaneously observe x - ray spectra covering the 0.2700 kev band with good energy resolution below 10 kev .",
    "recent numerical models of x - ray spectra based on monte carlo simulations @xcite are powerful tools to infer the geometry of the torus , such as the opening angle , column density , and inclination angle ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    since the obscured fraction of agns should reflect the covering fraction of the absorbing material , we expect the torus structure of llagns with @xmath12 ergs s@xmath1 may be different from that of typical seyfert galaxies with @xmath13 ergs s@xmath1 . in this paper , we present results from the first simultaneous x - ray spectra covering the 0.530 kev band of two nearby llagns , ngc  1566 ( @xmath14 = 0.0050 ) and ngc  4941 ( @xmath14 = 0.0037 ) observed with _",

    "the spectral analysis is performed on xspec version 12.7.1 .",
    "to apply the latest energy calibration of xis , we reprocess the unfiltered data with xispi and @xisrepro on the basis of the calibration database ( caldb ) released on 2012",
    "september 12 .",
    "the xis events are extracted from a circular region with a radius of 2.8 arcmin ( ngc  1566 ) or 1.8 arcmin ( ngc  4941 ) around the peak of the point spread function of the xrt .",
    "the background is taken from source - free , circular regions within the field - of - view .",
    "we only use the pin data from the hxd , as our targets are too faint in the energy band above 50 kev to be detected with the gso .",
    "we utilize so - called the `` tuned '' non x - ray background ( nxb ) model of hxd / pin produced with the lcfitdt method @xcite .",
    "then , the modelled cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) spectrum based on the formula of @xcite is added on that of the nxb .",
    "the systematic error of the nxb is estimated to be @xmath33 in the 1540 kev band for a unit of 40 ks exposure , which does not significantly affect our results .",

    ", we include the _ swift_/bat spectra in the 14195 kev band averaged over 70 months @xcite . the 1.71.9 kev band in the xis spectra is excluded to avoid systematic uncertainties in the energy response around the si k - edge region .",

    "spectra folded with the responses are plotted in the upper panels of figure  [ folded_spec ] .",
    "swift_/bat spectra in the photon flux unit are also shown there . as noticed , the spectrum of ngc 1566 is essentially unabsorbed , while that of ngc 4941 is subject to heavy absorption .",
    "conspicuous iron - k@xmath2 emission lines are noticed at the rest - frame 6.4 kev in both targets .",
    "we simultaneously fit the _ suzaku _ and _ swift_/bat spectra , which cover the wide energy range of 0.5195 kev altogether . to absorb the cross - calibration error in absolute fluxes between the xiss and the hxd , the relative normalization of the hxd / pin to fi - xiss",
    "is fixed to be 1.16 according to the result based on the crab nebula observations @xcite , while that between bi - xis and fi - xiss is set free because they cover the similar energy bands and even a small systematic error in their relative flux calibration would affect the fit significantly .",
    "we do not apply such correction for instrumental calibration between the _ suzaku _ and _ swift_/bat data , although time variability between the two periods is taken into account , as detailed below .",
    "we follow previous work by @xcite , who constrain the torus structures of two very luminous radio - loud agns , 3c 206 and pks 070735 , by applying a physically motivated spectral model to the data of _ suzaku _ and _ swift_/bat . in this paper",
    "we basically adopt the same model as in @xcite , which is composed of four components for the nucleus emission : ( 1 ) the primary transmitted component from the nucleus , ( 2 ) reflection component from the accretion disk , ( 3 ) that from the torus , and ( 4 ) scattered component from surrounding gas in the case of absorbed agn ( ngc 4941 ) . in addition , we also consider emission from an optically - thin thermal plasma in the host galaxy , which is often observed from llagns as `` soft excess '' below @xmath381 kev @xcite .",
    "it is modelled with the * apec * model @xcite on xspec .",
    "we approximate the shape of the primary continuum with an exponential cutoff power law model , @xmath39 . since it is not possible to set a meaningful limit on @xmath40 from our data , we fix it at 360 kev for consistency with the torus model by @xcite . even if we instead set @xmath41 at 300 kev , an averaged value in nearby agns reported by @xcite , the results of our spectral fits are little affected",
    ".    time variability of the direct component flux is expected between the short ( 2 days ) _ suzaku _ observation and the long ( 70 months ) _ swift_/bat observations . to reflect it ,",
    "we introduce a normalization factor of _ suzaku _ ( fi - xiss ) relative to the _ swift_/bat , @xmath42 , as a free parameter , assuming that the continuum shapes ( i.e. , @xmath43 and @xmath41 ) are constant .",
    "the same factor is also applied to the reflection component from the accretion disk , while we do not apply it to that from the torus , the scattered component , and the thin thermal emission , assuming that their fluxes do not change over years because of their large spatial scales .    for calculation of the reflection components",
    ", we utilize the * pexmon * model @xcite , which consists of the continuum of the * pexrav * model @xcite from cold matter and fluorescence lines of iron - k@xmath2 , iron - k@xmath44 , and nickel - k@xmath2 self - consistently calculated with the continuum .",
    "the only free parameter of the model is the reflection strength @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the solid angle of the reflector covering the x - ray source . as for the reflection component from the accretion disk",
    ", we apply blurring due to kepler motion and relativistic effects around a non - rotating black hole with the convolution model * rdblur*.    one important goal is to constrain the torus structure through its reflection component @xmath47 .",
    "since the two reflection components from the torus and accretion disk are strongly coupled with each other in spectral fit , we need to fix the reflection strength from the accretion disk on the basis of reasonable assumptions .",
    "following @xcite , we estimate a value of @xmath48 from the disk ( @xmath49 ) by combining a theoretical equivalent width of an iron - k@xmath2 line given by @xcite and the * pexmon * reflection code .",
    "@xcite calculates the iron - k@xmath2 equivalent width from an optically thick plane irradiated by a primary x - ray source above it for three parameters , ( i ) ratio between the height of the source ( @xmath50 ) and the inner radius of the disk ( @xmath51 ) , ( ii ) inclination , and ( iii ) photon index .",
    "we assume @xmath52 ( @xmath53 is the gravitational radius where @xmath54 , @xmath21 , and @xmath55 is the gravitational constant , black hole mass , and light velocity , respectively ) .",
    "some works suggest that the accretion disk of llagns with @xmath56 ergs s@xmath1 is not extending down to the innermost stable circular orbit , but likely to be truncated at much larger radii , @xmath57 ( e.g. , @xcite for m81 and ngc 4579 , @xcite for ngc 3998 , @xcite for ngc 1097 ) .",
    "we thus adopt the inner radius to be @xmath58 in our models .",
    "the inclination is assumed to be 30@xmath59 for ngc 1566 ( unobscured agn ) and 70@xmath59 for ngc 4941 ( obscured agn ) .",
    "we consider a range of photon index of @xmath601.92.1 as obtained from our data .",
    "the expected equivalent width of the iron - k@xmath2 line is then calculated to be 1521 ev ( ngc 1566 ) and 1416 ev ( ngc 4941 ) .",
    "we find that the corresponding reflection strength of the * pexmon * model that produces these values becomes @xmath61 in both targets .",
    "we confirm that the spectral parameters obtained from the broad band fits are not changed over the 90% confidence errors even if we assume different inclination angles within a range of 20@xmath59 - 60@xmath59 for ngc 1566 and 30@xmath59 - 80@xmath59 for ngc 4941 .",
    "effects by changing @xmath62 or @xmath50 ( and hence @xmath49 ) will be examined in the following subsections , which do not affect our conclusions , either .",
    "we first apply a simple model without any intrinsic absorption composed of the transmitted emission and torus reflection component to the spectra of ngc 1566 , which is optically classified as a type 1.5 agn .",
    "the latter is required to explain the strong narrow iron - k line .",
    "the model is represented as    *   * constant*zpowerlw*zhighect+pexmon *    in xspec terminology .",
    "the * constant * term takes into account flux variability of the direct component between the observation epochs of _ suzaku _ and _ swift_/bat , and the power law normalizations in the two terms are tied together . the inclination angle in the * pexmon * model",
    "is set to 60@xmath59 as a representative value , since the code assumes reflection from a half - infinite plane , which is too simple to be applied for a complex torus - like geometry .",
    "changing it to 30@xmath59 , however , does not affect our fitting results within the errors .",
    "since a majority of the torus reflection in type-1 agns can arise from its inner wall without self obscuration ( see e.g. , @xcite for an example of torus geometry ) , we do not apply any absorption to this component .",
    "the resultant chi - squared value is not acceptable , @xmath63 .    to improve the fit , we add a partial covering model to the first component , which is known to sometimes give a good description of agn spectra .",
    "the likely interpretation is that there is patchy material in the line of sight .",
    "this model composition is represented as    *   * constant*zpcfabs*zpowerlw*zhighect+pexmon * ,    where * zpcfabs * represents an absorption by cold matter with a column density @xmath64 and a covering fraction of @xmath65 .",
    "the addition of * zpcfabs * significantly improves the fit , yielding a chi - squared value of @xmath66 .",
    "note that the fit is considerably worse when a full covering model ( i.e. , @xmath67 ) is applied ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "next , we add emission from an optically - thin thermal plasma .",
    "this model , represented as    *   * constant*zpcfabs*zpowerlw*zhighect+pexmon+apec * ,    better explains the spectra with @xmath69 , and the improvement is confirmed at @xmath70 confidence level on the basis of an f - test .",
    "we obtain @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and the variability factor ( * constant * ) @xmath73 .    finally , as a physically motivated model introduced by @xcite",
    ", we further include the reflection component from the accretion disk into the above model .",
    "this `` final '' model is expressed as    *   * constant*zpcfabs*(zpowerlw*zhighect+rdblur*pexmon ) + + pexmon+apec * ,    where the second term represents the disk reflection component whose intensity is synchronized with that of the direct component ( the first term ) . the reflection strength from the accretion disk",
    "is fixed at @xmath74 ( see above ) , while that from the torus @xmath47 is still left to be a free parameter .",
    "note that , unlike @xmath49 , @xmath75 is defined relative to the flux determined with _",

    "this outer radius is appropriate if the disk is connected to the pc scale torus , although the choice of @xmath79 does not affect the fit at all .",
    "the index is based on a simple assumption of an irradiated disk by a source with a scale height above it ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "nevertheless , we adopt it in our paper as the best physically - motived model , because the reflection component from a truncated standard disk at @xmath139 , as suggested from previous studies of llagns ( @xcite , @xcite ) , should be expected even though it is weak . here",
    "we derive an upper limit for the strength of the disk reflection @xmath49 from the data . by adopting different values for the inner radius of @xmath140 , @xmath141 , and @xmath142 , which corresponds to @xmath143 , 0.3 , and 0.2 for the source scale height of @xmath144 ( see section [ broada ] ) , we obtain chi - squared values of 224.5 , 219.5 , 217.5 , respectively , from the broad band spectral fit .",

    "this implies that the smaller scale height , @xmath144 , is more reasonable unless the disk is truncated at a very large radius like @xmath149 . in any case",
    ", we confirm that our conclusion on the torus structure based on the iron - k@xmath2 line analysis described in section  [ torus ] is not affected by these uncertainties on the disk - reflection component , whose contribution to the total spectrum is rather small .",
    "we first apply the following model for the broad band spectra of ngc 4941 , which is a type-2 agn and shows clear evidence for an intrinsic absorption :    *   * constant*zphabs*zhighect*zpowerlw+zphabs*pexmon + + constant*zhighect*zpowerlw *    the first and second terms are the transmitted and disk reflection components , respectively . here",
    "we consider absorptions separately for the two components , with @xmath150 for the former and with @xmath151 for the latter , because the torus reflection comes from a large volume and hence could well be subject to a different absorption in average from that for the transmitted emission .",

    "it is assumed to have the same photon index @xmath43 as the transmitted component with a relative normalization of @xmath152 ( to the _",
    "swift_/bat flux ) .",
    "even though the chi - squared is already acceptable with this model ( @xmath153 ) , we add emission from a thin thermal plasma to the above model , which is often observed in type-2 agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) including llagns @xcite .",
    "the model composition is then expressed as    *   * constant*zphabs*zhighect*zpowerlw+zphabs*pexmon + + constant*zhighect*zpowerlw+apec*.    the addition of the thin thermal emission significantly improves the fit , reducing the chi - squared value to @xmath154 .",
    "we obtain @xmath155 , @xmath156@xmath31 , @xmath157 @xmath31 , @xmath158 , @xmath159% , and @xmath160 .    in the same way as the spectral analysis of ngc 1566",

    "again , an inclination of 60@xmath59 is assumed for the torus reflection component as a representative value so that we can more directly compare the result of ngc 1566 ; the best - fit parameters are not significantly changed even if when an inclination of 30@xmath59 is adopted instead .",
    "we find this model describes the observed spectra well ( @xmath162 ) with the best - fit parameters of @xmath163 , @xmath164 @xmath31 , @xmath165 @xmath31 , @xmath166 , and @xmath167% .",
    "we obtain @xmath168 , which indicates that the direct component flux was weaker by 52% during the _ suzaku _ observation than the 70-month average observed with _ swift_/bat .",
    "unlike the case of ngc 1566 , we can not constrain the strength of the disk reflection from our data , mainly due to the heavy obscuration of the direct and disk - reflection components .",
    "we obtain a similar chi - squared value of @xmath169 even when we assume @xmath170 corresponding to @xmath171 for @xmath144 , and @xmath172 when @xmath76 and @xmath173 corresponding to @xmath143 are adopted .",
    "nevertheless , with the same argument for ngc 1566 , we adopt this model that includes the disk reflection with @xmath174 as the best physical model for ngc 4941 .",
    "all the parameters are listed in table  [ bestfit_para ] .",
    "the best - fit folded model is plotted in figure  [ folded_spec ] with fitting residuals ( lower panel ) , and the unfolded spectra in units of @xmath84 are shown in figure  [ unfolded_spec ] .",

    "this procedure enables us to derive observed equivalent widths ( or their upper limits ) most directly from the data , independently of the assumption of the reflection model .",
    "here we use the spectra of the fi - xiss in the 39 kev band and those of bi - xis in the 38 kev band .",
    "basically , the best - fit continuum model obtained by the broad - band fit is adopted by replacing the * pexmon * components with the * pexrav * model , which does not contain fluorescence lines .",
    "instead , we add a * diskline * component @xcite as the iron - k@xmath2 emission line from the accretion disk , and * zgauss * as that from the torus .",
    "the line energies for both components are fixed at 6.4 kev in the rest frame , and the 1@xmath205 line width of * zgauss * is set to be 0.1 ev , which is unresolved with the xis .",
    "the line profile parameters in the * diskline * model are fixed at the same values as those in the * rdblur * component .",
    "thus , only the normalizations of * diskline * , * zgauss * , and * zpowerlw * are set free , while the other parameters are all fixed at their best fit values determined from the broad - band spectra .",
    "figure 4 shows the fi - xiss spectra in the 39 kev band folded with the energy response , where the best - fit models of * zgauss * are shown .    in both targets , the * diskline",
    "* components are not significantly detected with 90% confidence upper limits on `` observed '' equivalent widths with respect to the total continuum @xmath206 ev ( ngc  1566 ) and @xmath207 ev ( ngc  4941 ) .",
    "the error for ngc 4941 is larger than that for ngc 1566 because of the fainter continuum flux due to the heavy absorption and the large inclination assumed ( @xmath208 ) that produces a broader iron - k@xmath2 line profile . to compare these upper limits with the theoretical predictions , we need to subtract the contribution of the torus - reflection and scattered components from the total continuum",
    "thus we obtain `` corrected '' equivalent widths of @xmath209 ev ( ngc  1566 ) and @xmath210 ev ( ngc  4941 ) .",
    "these upper limits are consistent with the calculation by @xcite under our assumptions on the geometry between the primary source and disk ( @xmath211 ) and the inclination , 1521 ev for ngc  1566 and 1416 ev for ngc  4941 ( see section  [ analysis_result ] ) .",
    "hence , adopting the disk - reflection strength of @xmath146 in the broad - band spectral analysis is justified .",
    "note that even when we adopt a smaller inner radius of @xmath212 in the * diskline * and * rdblur * models , the broad iron - k@xmath2 line is not significant detected ; for @xmath51 = @xmath213 , @xmath214 , or @xmath141 we obtain an upper limit of @xmath215 ev in ngc 1566 , although the constraint is weaker in ngc 4941 .",
    "we find that the equivalent widths of * zgauss * relative to the total continuum are @xmath216 ev and @xmath217 ev for ngc  1566 and ngc  4941 , respectively .",
    "the observed equivalent width of a narrow iron - k@xmath2 line from the torus with respect to the total continuum is subject to variability of the transmitted component , however . from the broad band",
    "spectral analysis , we know that the fluxes during the _ suzaku _ observations were much fainter than those of _ swift_/bat in both targets .",
    "this leads to an overestimate of the true ( i.e. , time averaged ) equivalent widths of the iron - k@xmath2 line . on the basis of our assumption that the long - term _ swift_/bat data give the averaged continuum flux that determines the torus reflection strength and narrow iron - k@xmath2 line flux observed with _",
    "suzaku _ , we calculate the true continuum level at 6.4 kev by increasing the transmitted and disk - reflection components by a factor of @xmath218 , and then derive `` corrected '' equivalent width values , @xmath219 ev for ngc 1566 and @xmath220 ev for ngc 4941 .",
    "with _ suzaku _ and _ swift_/bat , we have obtained the broad - band x - ray spectra covering the 0.5195 kev band of the two llagns ngc 1566 ( type 1.5 ) and ngg 4941 ( type 2 ) for the first time .",
    "the spectrum of ngc 1566 is found to be essentially unobscured , while that of ngc 4941 is subject to heavy absorption .",
    "strong iron - k@xmath2 emission lines at the rest - frame 6.4 kev are detected in both targets .",
    "their spectra are well reproduced by a physically motivated model consisting of a partially or fully absorbed transmitted component with its reflection from the accretion disk , a reflection component from the torus , a scattered component ( in ngc 4941 ) , and optically - thin thermal plasma emission .",
    "the physical parameters of the thin thermal components ( temperature of @xmath221 0.20.9 kev and luminosities in the 0.32 kev band of diffuse x - ray emission ) are consistent with the origins from star - forming activities in the host galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although it may be partially contaminated by line emission from a photoionized plasma powered by the agn .",
    "in fact , the far - infrared luminosities calculated from the _ iras _ 60 @xmath222 m and 100 @xmath222 m fluxes by using the formula of @xcite are @xmath223 ergs s@xmath1 ( ngc  1566 ) and @xmath224 ergs s@xmath1 ( ngc  4941 ) , suggesting the presence of significant star - forming activities . in the analysis , we carefully take into account time variability of the transmitted plus disk reflection components between the _ suzaku _ and _ swift_/bat observations , while it is assumed that the last three components are constant . during the _ suzaku _ observations ,",
    "the flux levels of both objects were significantly fainter than their 70 months average obtained by _",
    "swift_/bat .",
    "an important result is that both ngc  1566 and ngc  4941 show moderate mount of the torus reflection , @xmath225 and @xmath117 , respectively , relative to the time - averaged flux of the direct component measured by _",
    "they are slightly smaller as a typical total reflection strength observed in seyfert galaxies , @xmath226 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the torus structure inferred from this result is quantitatively discussed in subsection  4.3 .",
    "we compare our results on ngc 4941 with previous results obtained by _ asca _ in 1996 july and 1997 january @xcite and _ beppo_sax in 1997 january @xcite , although much simpler spectral models are adopted there due to the limited statistics in the spectra .",
    "the equivalent width of the narrow iron - k@xmath2 line is reported to be @xmath227 ev ( _ asca _ ) and @xmath228 ev ( _ beppo_sax ) .",
    "the _ suzaku _",
    "result of @xmath229 ev may be slightly smaller than these .",
    "if we compare the iron - k@xmath2 line flux instead of equivalent width , however , we find they are all consistent within the statistical errors ; @xmath230 , @xmath231 , and @xmath232 photons @xmath31 s@xmath1 in the _ asca _ , _",
    "beppo_sax , and _ suzaku _ observations , respectively .",
    "this supports our hypothesis that the absolute flux of the reflection component originating from the torus is nearly constant as its variability is smeared out .",
    "the column density for the transmitted component ( @xmath233 @xmath31 ) is consistent with both that suggested by @xcite and by @xcite within the statistical error .",
    "we obtain the photon index @xmath155 , which is consistent with a canonical value of agns @xcite .",
    "@xcite report a little smaller photon index ( @xmath234 ) but this may be affected by the reflection component that is ignored in their model .",
    "the xis spectra in the 39 kev band suggest that a broad iron - k@xmath2 line feature arising from the inner accretion disk is very weak in ngc 1566 , although it is more difficult to constrain its intensity in ngc 4941 due to the heavy absorption and high inclination . applying a relativistic line profile with an inner radius of @xmath235",
    ", we obtain an upper limit on the corrected equivalent width of 42 ev for ngc 1566 .",
    "this result constrains the reflection strength from a cold accretion disk to be @xmath236 as defined in the * pexmon * model .",
    "in fact , when we adopt a larger value of @xmath237 expected from the case of @xmath238 ( where @xmath50 is the height of the irradiating source ) according to @xcite , the broad band fit of ngc 1566 becomes significantly worse ( @xmath239 ) compared with that for @xmath240 ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "the small reflection suggests that the inner disk is likely to be truncated at relatively large radius , although it is difficult to unambiguously determine the truncation radius , which depends on the assumed corona geometry .",
    "the weak disk reflection is consistent with the result by @xcite , who found @xmath241 for the llagn ngc 3998 ( @xmath242 ergs s@xmath1 ) from the x - ray spectrum .",
    "we do not rule out , however , the possibility that there is a very highly ionized disk that produces almost featureless continuum around the iron - k@xmath2 band .",
    "the equivalent width of narrow iron - k@xmath2 line from an agn is very useful to constrain the torus structure such as the opening angle .",
    "for this purpose , we utilize the monte - carlo based numerical model by @xcite , which calculates absorbed direct component and the reflected continuum with fluorescence lines from an agn surrounded by a torus . in this model ,",
    "the geometry of the torus is close to be a spherical shape defined by three parameters ( for details see figure  2 of @xcite ) : hydrogen column density at the equatorial plane @xmath243 , half opening angle @xmath244 , and inclination @xmath245 .",
    "hence , @xmath246 for type 1 agn and @xmath247 for type 2 agn .",
    "the incident spectrum is assumed to be a power law with an exponential cutoff at 360 kev . as done in @xcite , we plot the predicted equivalent width of the iron - k@xmath2 line as a function of half opening angle with several different inclinations in figures  [ ew2open_type1 ] for type-1 agns and figures  [ ew2open_type2 ] for type-2 agns .",
    "we consider two cases of @xmath248 @xmath31 or @xmath249 @xmath31 with @xmath24 ( the best fit value of ngc 1566 ) in figure  [ ew2open_type1 ] , while @xmath250 @xmath31 and @xmath28 , the best fit line - of - sight column density and photon index of ngc 4941 , are assumed in figure  [ ew2open_type2 ] . above @xmath251 where the ikeda model is not available , we extrapolate the data by assuming that the equivalent width is proportional to the volume of the torus .",
    "the dashed horizontal lines ( magenta ) in figures  [ ew2open_type1 ] and [ ew2open_type2 ] represent the error region of the corrected equivalent width @xmath252 for ngc 1566 and ngc 4941 , respectively .",
    "although the result of ngc 1566 does not constrain the half opening angle within the range of @xmath253 @xmath31 , the reflection strength @xmath72 implies @xmath254 by assuming @xmath255 . for ngc 4941 , the half opening angle is estimated to be @xmath6 from the iron - k@xmath2 equivalent width , which is consistent with @xmath256 .",
    "thus , in both targets , modest covering factors of the tori are suggested .",
    "according to the unified scheme , the torus covering fraction determines the fraction of obscured agns .",
    "thus , it is quite interesting to compare with the result on the type-2 fraction derived from unbiased agn surveys . on the basis of the _ swift_/bat survey performed in the 1555 kev band ,",
    "@xcite suggest that the fraction has a peak of @xmath90.60.8 around @xmath257 ergs s@xmath1 and decreases toward both higher and lower luminosity ranges . at @xmath258 ergs s@xmath1",
    ", the fraction is estimated to be @xmath259 ( see e.g. , their figure  16 ) , although the error is still quite large due to a limited number of llagns detected in the hard x - ray survey .",
    "similar results are also obtained from x - ray follow - up observations of _ iras _",
    "12  @xmath222 m selected galaxies @xcite . based on the best - fit model ,",
    "the 1555 kev luminosity of ngc 1566 and ngc 4941 are @xmath260 ergs s@xmath1 and @xmath261 ergs s@xmath1 .",
    "our result on the torus half - opening angle of these sources , @xmath254 , can be converted into an obscured fraction of 0.340.64 , which is fully consistent with the above survey results at a similar luminosity range .    near",
    "infrared reverberation mapping observations of nearby agns clearly show that the inner radius of agn tori scales as @xmath262 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which can be physically explained by dust sublimation by agn irradiation .",
    "this means that tori in llagns have a much smaller scale - height @xmath50 at the innermost radius @xmath51 compared with more luminous agns , in order to explain the observed small covering fraction ( i.e. , small @xmath263 ) .",
    "the physical reason is not clear , in particular if it is ultimately related to the low mass - accretion rates or just a consequence of radiation effects . for a hydrostatic disk where the central gravity by the smbh dominates over its self - gravity ,",
    "the ratio between `` thermal '' energy ( including kinetic energy of turbulent motion ) and gravitational potential determines the height to radius ratio .",
    "for simplicity , let us assume that llagns in the local universe have similar black hole masses as normal agns but their eddington ratios are smaller .",
    "in fact , our objects have @xmath264 ( see section  1 ) , which are small compared with a majority of _",
    "swift_/bat agns @xcite . then , for the same thermal energy inside the torus , the ratio @xmath263 becomes smaller in llagns , which could explain the observed trend .",
    "further studies of a larger sample of llagns covering a wide range of luminosity and eddington ratio would be useful to confirm our results and to understand the origin .",
