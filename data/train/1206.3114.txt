    "the curve complex @xmath6 of a surface @xmath0 is a simplicial complex whose @xmath7-simplices correspond to sets of @xmath8 distinct isotopy classes of essential simple closed curves on @xmath0 with pairwise disjoint representatives .",
    "a celebrated theorem of ivanov @xcite , korkmaz @xcite and luo @xcite asserts that curve complexes are _ simplicially rigid _ : the group @xmath4 of simplicial automorphisms of @xmath6 is , except in a few well - understood cases , isomorphic to the _ extended mapping class group _ @xmath9 .",
    "this result has subsequently been extended by irmak @xcite , behrstock - margalit @xcite , and shackleton @xcite to more general types of simplicial self - maps of @xmath6 , such as _ superinjective _ and _ locally injective _ maps ( recall that a simplicial map is locally injective if the restriction to the star of every vertex is injective ) .    in this article , we prove that curve complexes are _ finitely rigid _ , answering a question of lars louder @xcite . more concretely , we will show :    [ t : main ] let @xmath0 be an orientable surface of finite topological type .",
    "then there exists a finite simplicial complex @xmath10 such that for any locally injective simplicial map @xmath11 there exists an element @xmath12 with @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , @xmath14 is unique up to the ( finite ) point - wise stabilizer @xmath15 of @xmath1 .",
    "we will call the set @xmath1 in theorem [ t : main ] a _ finite rigid set _ in @xmath6 ( throughout , we will confuse subcomplexes @xmath10 and their vertex sets ) .",
    "the finite rigid sets we will construct in the proof of theorem [ t : main ] have diameter at most 2 in @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , a natural question is :    are there finite rigid sets in @xmath6 of arbitrarily large diameter ?    as we explain in section [ s : spheresofcurves ] , if @xmath0 is a sphere with punctures , the finite rigid set @xmath1 that we construct is a simplicial sphere of dimension equal to the homological dimension of @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , if @xmath0 is a sphere with six punctures , then @xmath1 is the sphere considered by broaddus in @xcite where he showed that it generates the top - dimensional homology group of @xmath6 .",
    "we thus ask the following question ; compare with conjecture 4.9 of @xcite :    suppose @xmath0 is a sphere with punctures .",
    "are the finite rigid sets in @xmath6 constructed in section [ s : spheres ] homologically non - trivial ?",
    "[ q : homology ]    the proof of theorem [ t : main ] is entirely constructive , although our methods become increasingly complicated as the genus of @xmath0 grows .",
    "for this reason , we will first establish theorem [ t : main ] for @xmath0 of genus 0 ( theorem [ t : sphere ] ) . in theorem [ t : tori ] we will prove our main result in the case of @xmath0 a torus .",
    "we will then treat the case of @xmath0 of genus at least 2 , dealing first with closed surfaces ( theorem [ t : closedsurfaces ] ) and then with the general case ( theorem [ t : punctured ] ) .",
    "we note that theorems [ t : sphere ] , [ t : tori ] , [ t : closedsurfaces ] and [ t : punctured ] contain more precise statements involving @xmath16 or @xmath5 .",
    "theorem [ t : main ] then follows from an application of the results in @xcite , which state that the homomorphism @xmath17 is surjective , with finite kernel , except when @xmath0 is a twice punctured torus .",
    "the techniques we use are similar to those used in @xcite .",
    "a common strategy is to use only intersection / nonintersection properties about some set of curves to deduce more precise geometric information about a particular pair of curves .",
    "for example , one can deduce that a pair of curves intersects once .",
    "given an automorphism of the curve complex , one uses this information to construct a candidate homeomorphism of the surface .",
    "it then remains to verify that the automorphism induced by the candidate homeomorphism agrees with the given automorphism on every curve .",
    "we use this same strategy , but must carefully choose the finite set of curves to find the right balance : not enough curves , and we can not determine the candidate homeomorphism ; too many curves , and we can not keep enough control to show that the candidate induces the given automorphism on every curve in our set .    * non - examples . * one might guess that a set of curves like the one shown on the left of figure [ f : nonexample ] would provide a finite rigid set @xmath10 . however , sending the curves on the left to the ones on the right determines a simplicial injection of @xmath1 into @xmath6 which can not come from the restriction of an automorphism of @xmath6 .",
    "we also note that on a closed surface of genus @xmath18 , there is no finite rigid set @xmath1 with less than @xmath19 curves , since any such set can be mapped to some subset of the curves in _ any _ pants decomposition",
