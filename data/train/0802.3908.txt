    "the systematic quest to understand how galaxies evolve as a function of epoch and environment remains in its infancy .",
    "galaxies in cluster environments may differ from field galaxies due to high initial densities leading to early collapse .",
    "furthermore , the relative importance of galaxy - galaxy interactions ( e.g. , galaxy harassment , tidal interactions , minor mergers , and major mergers ) and galaxy - icm interactions ( e.g , ram pressure stripping and compression ) are likely to differ between cluster and field environments due to the different number density of galaxies , galaxy velocity dispersions , icm density , and dm density .    in order to constrain how galaxies evolve in cluster environments ,",
    "we present a study based on the stages survey of the abell 901/902 supercluster ( gray et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the survey covers 0.5 @xmath5 0.5 degrees on the sky , and includes high resolution ( @xmath6 , corresponding to 280 pc at @xmath0  0.165 and @xmath7 = 70  km  s@xmath8  mpc@xmath8 . ] ) @xmath1 acs f606w images , along with combo-17 , @xmath2 24@xmath3 , xmm - newton x - ray data , and gravitational lensing maps ( gray et al .",
    "2002 ; heymans et al .",
    "the stages survey is complemented with accurate spectrophotometric redshifts with errors @xmath9/(1 + @xmath10)@xmath11  0.02 down to @xmath12=24 from the combo-17 survey ( wolf et al .",
    "2004 ) , and stellar masses ( borch et al .",
    "2006 ) . star formation rates ( sfrs ) are derived from the combo-17 uv and @xmath2 24@xmath3 data ( bell et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the supercluster sample of 2309 galaxies covers a broad range of luminosities , encompassing both dwarf and larger galaxies ( e to sd ) .",
    "we present many of our results separately for bright ( m@xmath13 -18 ; 798 galaxies ) , and faint galaxies ( -18 @xmath14 ; 1286 galaxies ) .",
    "this is because the morphological characterization is less robust for small dwarf galaxies , than for normal galaxies , due to surface brightness , spatial resolution ( 280 pc ) , and contamination from field galaxies .",
    "using the cas code ( conselice et al .",
    "2000 ) , the concentration ( c ) , asymmetry ( a ) , and clumpiness ( s ) parameters were derived from the @xmath1 acs f606w images .",
    "given that the cas merger criteria ( a@xmath15s and a@xmath150.35 ) tend to capture only a fraction of interacting / merging galaxies ( e.g. , conselice 2006 ; jogee et al .",
    "2007 ) , we also characterize the morphological properties via visual classification . in order to identify galaxies that are distorted due to a recent merger or tidal interaction",
    ", we take special care to classify galaxies into three distinct visual classes : ( 1 ) galaxies with _ externally - triggered _ distortions : these distortions , triggered by tidal interactions or mergers , include double or multiple nuclei inside a common body , tidal tails , arcs , shells , ripples , or tidal debris in body of galaxy , warps , offset rings , and extremely asymmetric sf or spiral arms on one side of the disk .",
    "galaxies are classified as strongly or weakly distorted , according to whether the distortions occupy a large or small fraction of the total light .",
    "( 2 ) galaxies with _ internally - triggered _ asymmetries ( classified as irr-1 ) : internally - triggered asymmetries are due to stochastic star - forming regions or the low ratio of ordered to random motions , common in irregular galaxies .",
    "these asymmetries tend to be correlated on scales of a few hundred parsecs , rather than on scales of a few kpc .",
    "( 3 ) relatively _ undistorted symmetric _ galaxies ( classified as normal ) .",
    "the assumed correlation implicit in the hubble sequence , between a high @xmath4 and a low gas and dust content , can often fail in cluster environments , where systems of low @xmath4 may have smooth featureless disks ( e.g. , koopmann & kenney 1998 ) .",
    "this begs the question of whether the classical morphology - density relation , which claims a larger fraction of early - type galaxies in dense environments , is driven by a larger fraction of gas - poor galaxies in such environments , or a larger fraction of bulge - dominated systems , or both . in order to address this question",
    ", we visually classify the clumpiness and @xmath4 ratio of galaxies separately , classifying galaxies into five categories : pure bulge ( pb ) , bulge plus disk ( b+d ) clumpy or smooth , and pure disk ( pd ) clumpy or smooth .",
    "we present below extracts of our preliminary findings .",
    "visual classification shows that @xmath113@xmath16 and @xmath110.4@xmath16 of bright ( m@xmath17 -18 ) and faint ( -18 @xmath14 ) galaxies are strongly distorted , respectively .",
    "( the results for faint galaxies are highly uncertain . ) .",
    "the distortion fraction for bright galaxies in abell 901/902 is lower than the values of 7% to 9% reported in the field for bright ( m@xmath18 -20 ; lotz et al .",
    "2007 ) or massive ( @xmath19  @xmath20 @xmath21 ; jogee et al . 2007 ) galaxies .",
    "most strongly distorted galaxies lie outside the cluster cores , avoid the peaks in dm surface mass density ( @xmath22 0.1 ) and icm density ( fig .",
    "these results are consistent with high galaxy velocity dispersions in the core being unfavorable to mergers and strong tidal interactions .",
    "it may also be due , at least in part , to the predominance in the core of gas - poor systems ( see point 6 below ; fig .",
    "1b ) , which tend to show shorter - lived tidal signatures .",
    "the uv - based sfr ranges primarily from 0.001 to 15 @xmath23 yr@xmath8 and rises with stellar mass ( fig .",
    "the average sfr@xmath24 is enhanced only by a modest factor of @xmath11  4 in strongly distorted galaxies compared to normal galaxies ( fig .",
    "a similar result is reported for distorted galaxies in field galaxies at @xmath0  0.2 ( e.g. , jogee et al .",
    "2007 ) . for 12% of the 798 bright galaxies having @xmath2 24@xmath3 detection , the uv+ir - based sfr ranges primarily from 0.01 to 50 @xmath23 yr@xmath8 , and the median ratio of ( sfr@xmath25/sfr@xmath24 ) is @xmath11  3 , indicating significant amounts of obscured star formation .",
    "the ssfr or sfr per unit stellar mass is on average lower at higher stellar mass , consistent with a large fractional growth happening in lower mass galaxies at later times ( fig .",
    "1d ) . only a modest enhancement in ssfr@xmath24 is seen in distorted galaxies compared to normal galaxies .",
    "smooth ( gas - poor ) galaxies cluster in regions of high icm density while clumpy ( gas - rich ) systems dominate at low icm densities ( fig 1b ) .",
    "the ratio of smooth ( gas - poor ) galaxies to very clumpy ( gas - rich ) galaxies within the central 0.3 mpc is ( 89@xmath16:11@xmath16 ) , ( 75@xmath16:25@xmath16 ) , and ( 86@xmath16:14@xmath16 ) , respectively , for a901a , a901b , and a902 .",
    "these values are comparable to the ratio of ( 80%:20% ) for early - type to late - type galaxies in the classical morphology - density relation ( dressler 1980 ) .",
    "future work will explore whether the ratio of bulge - dominated galaxies to disk - dominated galaxies also shows a similar trend with galaxy number density .",
