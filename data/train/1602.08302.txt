    "our neutrino masses are obtained by @xmath101 , where @xmath206 and @xmath96 is given by eq.([eq : md ] ) . using the casas - ibarra parametrization , the @xmath96",
    "is written by @xmath207 where @xmath208 is the mns matrix , @xmath209 s are neutrino masses , @xmath210 is an complex orthogonal matrix .",
    "@xmath210 is parametrized by three complex parameters : @xmath211 , @xmath212 , @xmath213 .",
    "generally , a matrix @xmath214 is factorized by the following form , @xmath215 where @xmath216 is diagonal matrix and l ( u ) is upper ( lower ) triangular matrix with unit diagonal components .",
    "the factorization is called ldu decomposition .",
    "we can factorize @xmath96 using the ldu decomposition as follows : @xmath217 where @xmath218 , @xmath219 and the diagonal matrix @xmath220 is written by @xmath221 we assume @xmath222 and @xmath223 are lower triangular matrices .",
    "the components of @xmath224 and @xmath46 are written by the following form , @xmath225 in this case , @xmath226 becomes a lower triangular matrix : @xmath227 @xmath228 are determined by neutrino oscillation experiments .",
