    "it will belong to the eigenspace associated with the eigenvalue @xmath116 .",
    "we start from the eigenfunction @xmath117 which has four rectangular nodal domains , shown in figure [ fig1a ] .",
    "we perturb this eigenfunction by adding a small multiple of the eigenfunction @xmath118 for @xmath119 , we get the eigenfunction @xmath120 since @xmath121 is negative in the neighborhood of the critical points in @xmath122 , adding @xmath123 has the effect of opening small `` channels '' that connect the nodal domains where @xmath124 is negative . as a result , if @xmath125 is small enough , @xmath126 has three nodal domains , one where it is negative and two where it is positive ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "let us note that these ideas have already been used , to construct examples of eigenfunctions whose nodal set satisfies some prescribed properties , in @xcite .",

    "coordinates the nodal set of the function @xmath126 satisfies the equation @xmath133 a simple computation shows that this is the equation of an hyperbola . furthermore , when @xmath134",
    ", this hyperbola has one branch in the lower left quadrant @xmath132 - 1,0[\\times]-1,0[$ ] and one in the upper right quadrant @xmath1320,1[\\times]0,1[\\,$ ] .    on the other hand",
    ", we have the following symmetries of @xmath126 : @xmath135 and @xmath136 this allows us to recover the nodal set on the whole of @xmath32 .",
    "it consists in two simple closed curves , each containing one branch of the previously considered hyperbola .",
    "each of these closed curves enclose a nodal domain that is homeomorphic to a disk .",
    "let us now consider the complement of the closure of those two region .",
    "it is the third nodal domain .",
    "[ rmkodd ] the construction used to prove proposition [ prop3dom ] can obviously be generalized .",
