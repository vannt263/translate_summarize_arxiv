    "we start with the classical features of the model and show that the dissipative classical equation of motion is derived from the action ( [ ( 1 ) ] ) . by eliminating the environmental variable @xmath11 with the boundary condition @xmath16 , the equation of motion of @xmath15 takes the following form : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is an infinitesimal positive regulator to assure the boundary condition .",
    "we have introduced the spectral density function @xmath19 which characterizes the environment , @xmath20 a suitable choice of @xmath19 generates dissipation .",
    "for example , if we set @xmath21 , then eq . ( [ ( 4 ) ] ) reads @xmath22 where @xmath23 is an ultraviolet cutoff of the environmental oscillator frequencies .",
    "the effects of the environment @xmath11 appear as the ohmic dissipation term @xmath24 and the correction to the potential @xmath25 .",
    "the latter can be absorbed by a local counterterm and hereafter we are interested only in the dissipation effect .",
    "we study general types of dissipation obtained by @xmath26 , where cases of @xmath27 are called super - ohmic .",
    "then the effective equation of motion is @xmath28 where only the highest derivative term breaking the time reversal symmetry has been included .",
    "the origin of the time reversal symmetry breaking is the boundary condition @xmath16 for eliminating the variable @xmath11 .",
    "note that , in order to get a function @xmath19 that is exactly a simple polynomial in @xmath29 , an infinite number of gapless oscillators @xmath11 are required .",
    "this infinite number of oscillators is actually supplied by some field degrees of freedom ( the electromagnetic field , the phonon field , etc . ) .      in the euclidean path",

    "in fact they are all even power terms in the fourier transform and are irrelevant to dissipation .",
    "for example , in the case of ohmic dissipation @xmath21 , we identify the dissipative part as follows : @xmath34&=&-~\\!\\tilde{\\alpha}(e=0 ) \\int d\\tau~q^2(\\tau ) , \\label{(12)}\\\\ \\delta s_{\\rm nl}[q]&=&\\!\\!\\frac{1}{2}\\int\\ ! d\\tau\\!\\int\\",

    "we study the influence of @xmath33 on the quantum behaviors of @xmath15 . note that @xmath33 is symmetric under time reversal , and we will not see any real dissipating phenomena . as shown below , the effect of @xmath33 modifies the propagator of @xmath15 , and is interpreted as various cutoff effects in the nprg point of view . using the nprg method we evaluate the effective potential ( free energy ) of the expectation value of the target system variable @xmath15 , and",

    "we will evaluate the critical dissipation for the localization phase transition using the critical scaling behavior .      originally the nprg method was formulated and used mainly in statistical mechanics or quantum field theory to analyze critical phenomena @xcite .",

    "although the @xmath54 functional is obtained without any approximations , we have to make some approximations to solve the nprg equation .",
    "we define a sub theory space in the full theory space and project the full equation ( [ ( 21a ) ] ) onto the subspace , which defines a reduced equation on the subspace . as a subspace , we take the local potential space spanned by actions of the following form : @xmath57&=&\\int d\\tau \\left [ \\frac{1}{2}~\\dot{q}^2 + v_{\\lambda}(q ) \\right].\\label{(21b ) }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this subspace , the potential function @xmath58 defines a theory , and our subspace is still an infinite - dimensional function space .",
    "then the reduced renormalization transformation is given by @xmath59 where we path integrate the shell mode up to one - loop order .",
    "taking the continuous limit @xmath60 , the one - loop evaluation becomes exact , and we obtain the reduced nprg equation @xmath61 we will work with this equation , which is called the local potential approximated wegner - houghton ( lpa w - h ) equation @xcite . note that no perturbative expansion has been adopted to obtain eq .",

    "we may improve the approximation by enlarging the sub theory space , and it is completely free of any sort of series expansion and nonconvergence problems . due to these features , we expect that the nprg method will work excellently for the nonperturbative analysis of quantum systems .",
