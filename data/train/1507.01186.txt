    "historically the theory of swimming and flying has developed in two quite different directions @xcite .",
    "on the one hand there is the work on swimming and flying of a plate at high reynolds number started by von krmn and burgers @xcite and continued by lighthill @xcite,@xcite and wu @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the work is based on euler s equations for irrotational flow of a fluid with vanishing viscosity .",
    "the discontinuity in velocity potential at the rear of the body is resolved by a vortex street . on the other hand",
    "there is the work on swimming at low reynolds number based on stokes equations for a viscous incompressible fluid .",
    "this work was started by taylor @xcite with his model of a swimming sheet , and continued for bodies of different shapes by lighthill @xcite , purcell @xcite , and shapere and wilczek @xcite,@xcite among others .",
    "taylor s work on a swimming sheet was extended by reynolds @xcite , who considered the effect of fluid inertia on the swimming velocity .",
    "his work was corrected by tuck @xcite , who calculated the mean rate of dissipation as well . for transverse plane wave displacements of given wavenumber and frequency",
    "the fluid flow to first order in the amplitude is irrotational in the limit of small viscosity , but the relation to the work of lighthill and wu is not clear . in the latter",
    "the swimming speed is treated as a parameter , and the thrust is calculated instead .",
    "the concept of thrust plays no role in the work of reynolds and tuck .",
    "the swimming of a sheet in the limit of small viscosity has been studied by childress @xcite by the technique of matched asymptotic expansions .    in recent work on swimming and flying of an assembly of rigid spheres",
    "@xcite we have developed a mechanical model for which the swimming velocity and mean rate of dissipation can be calculated in the whole range of fluid viscosity and mass density . in the model",
    "the mean thrust , equal and opposite to the mean drag , vanishes identically in periodic swimming .",
    "further investigation into different models in the full range of viscosity and inertia would be helpful . in the following we study small amplitude swimming of a slab , which continues earlier work @xcite on the resistive limit .",
    "we begin by rederiving tuck s expressions for a sheet using the method of felderhof and jones @xcite .",
    "subsequently the same method is used to study the swimming of a slab .",
    "the main purpose of the present study is to investigate the effect of fluid inertia on the efficiency of swimming for a simple model .",
    "tuck s extension of taylor s work on the swimming of a sheet showed that in that case fluid inertia has a negative effect in the sense that the swimming velocity for a stroke of given power is always less than for purely resistive stokes flow .",
    "the same is true for swimming by longitudinal distortions in the plane of the sheet , also investigated by tuck @xcite . on the other hand , for a slab one can consider swimming by potential flow , where viscosity plays no role and the swimming is achieved purely by inertia and the effect of added mass . as we show below , such potential swimming is just as efficient as that of taylor s sheet or the squirming sheet in the stokes limit .    after a discussion of tuck s work on transverse waves on a sheet we study first the swimming of a slab by irrotational flow .",
    "the flow pattern has a different symmetry from that considered by lighthill and wu , the first order flow potential and pressure being continuous across the slab .",
    "the stroke consists of a circular motion of points on the surface of the slab , as in gravity waves , and of opposite circular polarization on both sides .",
    "there is no viscous boundary layer .",
    "it turns out that the swimming efficiency , defined as the ratio of swimming speed and mean rate of dissipation , divided by viscosity , is independent of both viscosity and fluid mass density .",
    "it has the same value as for taylor s sheet .",
    "subsequently we study a squirming slab with displacements in the plane of the slab , so that the displacement wave is longitudinal .",
    "it turns out that the swimming efficiency for this stroke is always larger than that of tuck s solution for the transverse wave . in both cases the efficiency tends to taylor s value in the limit of large viscosity and to zero in the limit of small viscosity .",
    "the latter behavior implies that these linearly polarized waves give a poor description of swimming and flying at small dimensionless viscosity @xmath0 .",
    "the wingtip path for birds is close to elliptic , or sometimes a figure eight @xcite . to obtain a better description of swimming and flying at small viscosity",
    "it is therefore natural to consider strokes with a forward motion in the form of an elliptically polarized wave .",
    "we consider in particular a slab with symmetric displacements on both sides , given by an elliptically polarized plane wave , characterized by a polarization angle @xmath1 .",
    "the displacement vector is given by eqs .",
    "( 2.12 ) and ( 6.1 ) . for @xmath2",
    "the solution is identical to the squirming flow solution mentioned above .",
    "for @xmath3 it corresponds to the potential flow solution , and for @xmath4 it is identical to tuck s transverse solution apart from a sign factor for the flow in the lower half - space .",
    "the polarization angle @xmath1 can be used to optimize the efficiency for fixed wavenumber and frequency .",
    "it turns out that in the resistive limit the efficiency is maximal for @xmath5 , with efficiency a factor @xmath6 larger than for taylor s solution , as we found earlier @xcite . for smaller values of the dimensionless viscosity",
    "@xmath0 the optimum angle is in the range @xmath7 and leads to a value of the optimum efficiency between one and @xmath6 times that of taylor s sheet . in the inertia - dominated limit , characterized by @xmath8 ,",
    "the optimum corresponds to @xmath3 and the potential flow solution .",
    "the optimum value of the efficiency in this limit is identical to that of taylor s sheet . in figs .",
    "4 and 5 we present a sketch of the nature of the motion at the surface of the slab for this case .",
    "the calculation suggests that in other geometry as well , the potential flow solution without viscous boundary layer is of paramount importance in the limit of low viscosity .",

    "the fluid is set in motion by the time - dependent distortions of the slab .",
