    "also , much experimental progress has been made to demonstrate smss and scss : in superconducting systems ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , laser trapped ions  @xcite , optical systems constructed by rydberg atoms , and superconducting cavity in the microwave regime  @xcite .",
    "the smss , which are formed by two optical coherent states , e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite , have been investigated for applications in quantum information processing  @xcite .",
    "these states can be used as a robust qubit encoding for a single bosonic mode subject to amplitude damping .",
    "they can also be used to study both the measurement process and decoherence by coupling the system to the external environment  @xcite .",
    "thus , generating and measuring smss and scss are not only important to understand fundamental physics , but also to explore potential applications .    superconducting quantum devices  @xcite allow to perform quantum state engineering including the demonstration of scss and smss .",
    "theoretical schemes to generate superpositions that are different from the above experiments  @xcite have also been proposed  @xcite in superconducting quantum devices . for example , the scheme in ref .",
    "@xcite generates a superpositions of bloch states for the current of a josephson junction .",

    "@xcite proposed a similar scheme as in ref .",

    "@xcite , a scheme was proposed to generate smss and squeezed states for a superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) ring modelled as an oscillator . since then , several proposals have been made which focus on superconducting qubits interacting with the nonclassical electromagnetic field  @xcite .",
    "optical states allow a fast and convenient optical transmission of the quantum information which is stored in charge qubits .",
    "compared with the harmonic system  @xcite formed by the large superconducting junction and the micromechanical resonator , optical qubits can easily fly relatively long distances between superconducting charge qubits .",
    "moreover , the qubit formed by smss enables a more efficient error correction than that formed by the single photon and vacuum states , and the generation and detection of coherent light are easy to implement .",
    "in contrast to  @xcite , here we aim at generating scss in the interaction system between a single - mode microwave cavity field and a squid - based charge qubit , and then creating smss by virtue of the measurements of the charge states .",
    "the generation of such states has been studied theoretically  @xcite and demonstrated in optical cavity qed experiments  @xcite . however , in these cases : i ) several operations are needed because atoms must pass through three cavities , and ii ) the interaction times are tuned by the controlling velocity of the atoms flying through the cavity . in our proposal , we need only one cavity , and interaction times are controlled by changing the external magnetic field .    although our scheme is similar to that proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the interaction between the box and the resonator in ref .",
    "@xcite is not switchable . due to the fixed coupling in ref .",
    "@xcite , the transfer of information between the micromechanical resonator and the box still exists even after the scss or smss are produced . in our proposal ,",
    "the interaction between the cavity field and the squid can be switched off by a classical magnetic field after the scss or smss are generated .",
    "furthermore , three operations , with different approximations made in every operation , are required in ref .",
    "in addition , in order to minimize the environmental effect on the prepared state , the number of operations and instruments should be as small as possible ; _ one _ operation is enough to generate scss or smss .",

    "the qubit is assumed to work in the charge regime with @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are the boltzmann constant , temperature , charge and superconducting gap energies , respectively . for known charge qubit experiments , e.g. in ref .",

    "we consider a gate voltage range near a degeneracy point @xmath16 , where only two charge states , called @xmath17 and @xmath18 , play a leading role .",

    "because the superconducting microwave cavity is assumed to only contain a single mode of the magnetic field , the wave vector @xmath51 is a constant for the given cavity .",
    "the magnetic field is assumed to propagate along the @xmath52 direction and the polarization of the magnetic field is along the normal direction of the surface area of the squid .",
    "if the area of the squid is , e.g. , of the order of @xmath53 , then its linear dimension , e.g. , approximately of the order of 10@xmath54 m , should be much less than the microwave wavelength of the cavity mode .",
    "thus , the mode function @xmath55 can be considered to be approximately independent of the integral area and the factor @xmath56 only depends on the position @xmath57 where the qubit is located .",
    "so the parameter @xmath30 can be expressed as @xmath58 which shows that the parameter @xmath59 depends on the area @xmath34 and the position @xmath57 of the squid , the wavelength @xmath60 of cavity field , and the volume @xmath47 of the cavity .",

    "a superposition of two squeezed coherent states can be obtained by the measurement on the charge qubit .",

    "( [ eq:2 ] ) , the interaction between the cavity field and the charge qubit is switchable ( e.g. , the last term in eq .  ( [ eq:3 ] ) vanishes for @xmath91 ) .",

    "( [ eq:2 ] ) , then the qubit - field coupling is not switchable .",
    "our analytical expressions show how to prepare the schrdinger states for the system of the microwave cavity field and the squid - based charge qubit , we further show that the superpositions of two macroscopically distinguishable states can also be created by measuring the charge states .",
    "however , similarly to the optical cavity qed  @xcite , prepared superpositions of states are limited by the following physical quantities : the rabi frequency @xmath126 ( which determines the quantum operation time @xmath127 of two charge qubit states through the cavity field ) , the lifetime @xmath128 of the cavity field , the lifetime @xmath129 and dephasing time @xmath130 of the charge qubit , as well as the measurement time @xmath131 on the charge qubit .",
    "we now estimate the rabi frequency @xmath132 in the microwave regime for a standing - wave field in the cavity . a squid with an area of about @xmath133 is assumed to be placed in the middle of the cavity . in the microwave regime with different ratios of @xmath134 , we provide a numerical estimate of @xmath135 for @xmath136 in a full - wavelength cavity , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , and a quarter - wavelength cavity , shown in fig .  [ fig1](b ) .",
    "the results reveal that a shorter wavelength of cavity field corresponds to a larger rabi frequency @xmath132 . for example , in the full - wavelength cavity and the case of the ratio @xmath137 , @xmath135 with microwave length @xmath138 cm is of the order of @xmath139 hz , and yet it is about @xmath140 hz for a microwave wavelength of @xmath141 cm . in both cases ,",
    "the transition times from @xmath142 to @xmath143 are about @xmath144 s and @xmath138 s respectively , where @xmath75 ( @xmath145 ) is the vacuum ( single - photon ) state . the experiment for this scheme should be easier for shorter wavelengths than for long wavelengths .",
    "since the cavity field has higher energy for the shorter wavelength , so it is better to choose the material with a larger superconducting energy gap to make the josephson junction for the experiment in the region of the shorter microwave wavelengths . for a fixed wavelength ,",
    "the effect of the ratios @xmath134 on the coupling between the cavity field and the charge qubit is not so large .",
    "however , decreasing the volume @xmath47 of the cavity can also increase the coupling .    in order to obtain a sms , the readout time @xmath146 of the charge qubit should be less than the dephasing time @xmath130 of the charge qubit ( because the relaxation time @xmath129 of the charge qubit is longer than its dephasing time @xmath130 ) and the lifetime time @xmath147 of the cavity field .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite with a set of given parameters , the estimated time , @xmath148 ns , is less than @xmath149 ns  @xcite . for a good cavity  @xcite",

    "so the readout is possible within current technology .",

    "in conclusion , we have analyzed the generation of schrdinger cat states via a controllable squid - type charge qubit . based on our scheme ,",
    "the smss can be created by using one quantum operation together with the quantum measurements on the charge qubit .",
    "after the scss or smss are created , the coupling between the charge qubit and the cavity field can be switched off , in principle . because all interaction terms of higher order in @xmath115 are negligible for the coupling constant @xmath157 .",
    "this results in a switchable qubit - field interaction .",
    "this means _ sudden switching _ of the flux on time scales of the inverse josephson energy(@xmath158ghz ) . at present",
    "this is difficult but could be realized in the future .",
    "we have also proposed a scheme to generate superpositions of two squeezed coherent states if we can keep the expansion terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) up to second order in @xmath115 .",
    "however , in this case the interaction between the cavity field and the charge qubit can not be switched off . by using the same method employed for trapped ions  @xcite , we can measure the decay rate of the smss and obtain the change of the @xmath150 value due to the presence of the squid .",
    "also , the generated smss can be used as a source of optical qubits .",
    "our suggestion is that the first experiment for generating nonclassical states via the interaction with the charge qubit should be the generation of superpositions of two macroscopically distinct coherent states .",
    "it needs only one quantum operation , and the condition for the coupling between the cavity field and the charge qubit can be slightly relaxed .",
