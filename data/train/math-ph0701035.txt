    "controlling quantum systems offers a great potential for performing computational tasks or for simulating the behaviour of other quantum systems @xcite .",
    "this is because the complexity of many problems @xcite reduces upon going from classical to quantum hardware .",
    "it roots in feynman s observation @xcite that the resources required for simulating a quantum system on a classical computer increase exponentially with the system size . in turn",
    ", he concluded that using quantum hardware might therefore _ exponentially decrease _ the complexity of certain classical computation problems .",
    "coherent superpositions of quantum states used as so - called ` qubits ' can be viewed as a particularly powerful resource of quantum parallelism unparalleled by any classical system .",
    "important applications are meanwhile known in quantum computation , quantum search and quantum simulation : most prominently , there is the exponential speed - up by shor s quantum algorithm of prime factorisation @xcite , which relates to the general class of quantum algorithms @xcite solving hidden subgroup problems in an efficient way @xcite .",
    "however , for exploiting the power of quantum systems , one has to steer them by classical controls such as voltage gates , radio - frequency pulses , or laser beams .",
    "it is highly desirable to do so in an optimal way , because the shapes of these controls critically determine the performance of the quantum system in terms of overlap of its actual final states with the desired target states . here ,",
    "the aim is to show how quantum optimal control relates to finding points on the unitary orbit of the initial quantum state @xmath1 ( in its density matrix representation ) maximally projecting onto the desired target state @xmath0 which is equivalent to maximising the target function @xmath7 over all unitaries to yield the _ @xmath0 \"  numerical radius of @xmath1_. this is the scope in systems that are fully controllable in the sense that every propagator @xmath4 can be realised on the physical system in question .    yet , often only local unitary operations @xmath8 are actually available . then the corresponding optimisation problems are confined to a subset of the conventional @xmath0 \"  numerical range : this is the motivation to introduce the _ local @xmath0 \"  numerical range _ @xmath6 as a special case of the _ relative @xmath0 \"  numerical range _",

    ", we finally give an outlook on contrained optimisation problems , i.e. , those in which extremal points in the @xmath0 \"  numerical range are searched subject to fulfilling contraints such as keeping @xmath10 orthogonal to an undesired state @xmath11 or leaving a neutral state @xmath12 invariant .",
    "since in general , a precise characterisation of solutions in algebraic terms is often beyond reach , we resort to numerical methods based on gradient flows on the unitary group .      as usual in quantum mechanics",
    ", one may choose to represent a state of a pure quantum system by a state vector in hilbert space , @xmath13 .",
    "its norm induced by the scalar product can be set to @xmath14 , as will be assumed henceforth .",
    "the operators associated to quantum mechanical observables such as the hamiltonian @xmath15 are selfadjoint , so @xmath16",
    ". then the hamiltonian dynamics is governed by schrdinger s equation of motion @xmath17 invoking stone - von neumann s theorem , the solution involves a time evolution by an element @xmath18 of the strongly continuous one - parameter group @xmath19 generated by the hamiltonian @xmath15 , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "non - pure quantum states comprise the settings of classically mixed states as well as reduced representations of quantum systems allowing for the description of open dissipative systems . in these cases",

    "for pure quantum states it takes the form of the scalar product @xmath28 @xmath29 while for non - pure states ( using the hilbert - schmidt analogue @xmath30 ) it reads @xmath31 clearly , in pure states the expectation value is an element of the field of values @xmath32 , whereas in non - pure states it is an element of the @xmath0-numerical range @xmath33 then taking the form of a real line segment .",
    "the latter is of particular significance , e.g. , in ensemble spectroscopy , where it is customary to collect all signal - relevant components of the selfadjoint operator @xmath34 in a new operator @xmath0 that need no longer be hermitian , and likewise the pertinent terms of @xmath35 in a general complex operator @xmath1 . thus moving from the selfadjoint operators",
    "@xmath36 to arbitrary , not necessarily hermitian ( yet bounded ) operators @xmath37 , the analogue to the ensemble expectation value then becomes a general element of the @xmath0-numerical range @xmath38 , where here and henceforth @xmath39 are taken to be finite - dimensional in view of spin and pseudo - spin systems .",
