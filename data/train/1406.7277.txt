    "the standard model of cosmology , @xmath4cdm , explains anisotropies on cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation @xcite and the large scale structure ( lss ) observations with good accuracies @xcite .",
    "this model is based on the assumption of cold dark matter as the skeleton of the structures in the universe @xcite and the cosmological constant as the source of late time acceleration while the initial conditions are set by the inflationary paradigm @xcite .",
    "inflation generates nearly scale - invariant , nearly gaussian and nearly adiabatic perturbations which are imprinted on the temperature map of cmb and also provides the initial distribution for the seeds of structures in the early universe @xcite .",
    "accordingly , one of the triumphs of modern cosmology is the compatibility of the dark matter tracers distribution with the statistics of cmb temperature anisotropy @xcite .",
    "thanks to vast cosmological data available during last decade , models of early universe are well - constrained by cosmological observations . in particular , the high precision maps of cmb have been studied extensively to put constraints on inflationary models @xcite .",
    "any deviation from the gaussian , adiabatic , isotropic and scale - invariant initial conditions will open distinct fingerprints on cmb map as tools to study the physics of early universe such as inflation @xcite . on the other hand , the lss observables , by transferring the initial condition of perturbations to the late time observables , are potentially very useful tools to test models of early universe in sub - cmb scales @xcite .",
    "the abundance of the structures in the universe @xcite , the scale - dependence of bias parameter between dark matter halos as the host of galaxies and the dark matter perturbations @xcite and higher order statistics of dark matter tracers ( e.g. the bispectrum of galaxies ) @xcite are all used to probe the deviations from the standard initial conditions .",
    "there are indications for anomalous features in cmb map such as power asymmetry between the two cmb hemispheres @xcite , power deficit in low multipoles @xcite and the coincidence of the quadrupole and octupole directions @xcite .",
    "these observations trigger the motivation to study the predictions of inflationary models with anomalous features in lss observables .",
    "we note that the cmb maps cover the first few e - folds of the inflationary period , say the first 5 - 7 e - folds , while the remaining 50 or so e - folds are below the cmb scales .",
    "it is likely that the primordial power spectrum may have non - trivial features not only on cmb scales but also on scales which are beyond the probe of cmb but are accessible to lss observations . in this work",
    "we investigate the framework under which one can study the probable observational fingerprints of anomalous inflationary power spectrum on lss , specially in the abundance of the structure . having this said , there are open questions in lss , specially on galactic scale , such as the  missing satellite \" problem @xcite and the  too big to fail \" problem @xcite which may be considered as hints for anomalies / features in primordial curvature perturbation power spectrum on galactic scales ( for a recent work addressing this idea see @xcite ) .",
    "it is worth to mention that the theoretical predictions of standard model for matter power spectrum are in reasonable agreements with the observational data in the range of wavenumber ( scales ) @xmath5 .",
    "however , the amplitude of small scale dark matter power spectrum is not strongly constrained by lss observables .",
    "accordingly , there are freedoms on the amplitude of the power on galactic scales which in turn can be used as an explanation for the missing satellite problem .",
    "therefore the anomalous inflationary models , by modifying the power on small scales , can be considered as a possible solutions to the tension between observations and theory on galactic scales .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec - ii ] first we review the procedure for obtaining the number density of structures based on excursion set theory @xcite and then we study the effects of the primordial feature on the number density of structures in a model - independent way . in section [ theory ]",
    "we present the theoretical motivations for generating primordial features studied in this paper . in section [ sec - iii ] , we study the predictions of each anomalous inflationary model on the abundance of the structures .",
    "the reader who is not interested in theoretical realization of the features can skip section [ theory ] and go directly to section [ sec - iii ] .",
    "the conclusion and future prospects are presented in section [ sec - iv ] .",
    "the mass function of the dark matter halo structures can be found from the excursion set theory ( est ) as a barrier crossing problem of density perturbation in different mass scales ( window functions ) @xcite .",
    "the number density @xmath6 of virialized objects with the mass between @xmath7 and @xmath8 is @xcite [ eq : massfunc ] n(m , z)=-2f ( ) where @xmath9 is the mean matter density and @xmath10 is the universality function of halo distribution which is a function of height parameter @xmath11 .",
    "here @xmath12 is the critical density ( in spherical collapse ) @xcite and @xmath13 is the variance of the structures with mass @xmath7 at the specific redshift @xmath14 .",
    "the variance is defined as [ eq : sigma ] ^2(m , z)= p_l(k , z ) w^2(kr)=k^2p_l(k , z)w^2(kr ) where @xmath15 is the linear matter power spectrum and the second equality in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma ] ) is obtained with the assumption of isotropic density perturbations .",
    "in addition , @xmath16 is the window function , which for the top - hat filter in real space , has the following form in momentum space w(x)=3 , in which modes with @xmath17 are smoothed out .",
    "the variance obtained for each mass scale is related to the radius of window function via the relation @xmath18 .",
    "an important point to mention is the universality of mass function , i.e. it is only a function of the height parameter @xmath19 .",
    "the universality means that on each mass range we have the same dependence on the height parameter .",
    "the height parameter @xmath19 encodes the information about the local threshold of collapse as well as the variance of matter perturbations which the latter depends on the cosmological model .",
    "the press - schechter mass function , as one of the first proposals for the universality function , is defined as @xcite f()= e^-^2/2 , assuming that the primordial seeds of the structures have a gaussian distribution .",
    "the n - body simulations have investigated the validity of the press - schechter conjecture and have found that it works with @xmath20 accuracy .",
    "the sheth - tormen mass function , incorporating the idea of ellipsoidal collapse @xcite , has the universality function @xmath10 given by @xcite f()= c e^-a^2/2 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are constants which are determined from n - body simulations of lss and @xmath23 is determined from the requirement that @xmath24 . in the limit @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27",
    ", we recover the press - schechter proposal .",
    "the discrepancy between press - schechter and the results obtained from the n - body simulation indicates the complexity of non - linear structure formation .",
    "in addition , it may indicate that the assumptions such as the spherical collapse or the markovianity of the random walks of matter density perturbations in est framework are only approximation to the real process of collapse .",
    "there is a vast literature on the prediction of dark matter clustering in est framework with deviations from gaussianity , markovianity and spherical collapse @xcite . in this work , in order to simplify the analysis and also in order to get some intuitions on the effects of anomalous features on lss abundances , we consider only the press - schechter and sheth - tormen universality functions .    in order to study the effects of feature in primordial curvature perturbations on the abundance of the structures we should relate the late - time linear matter power spectrum to the initial curvature perturbations power spectrum .",
    "the poisson equation relates the matter density contrast in fourier space , @xmath28 , to the gravitational potential ( bardeen potential ) @xmath29 via _ m ( k , z ) = , where @xmath30 is the matter density parameter at the present time ( hereafter we omit the superscript @xmath31 in density parameter ) and @xmath32 is the present value of hubble parameter .",
    "now we can relate the gravitational potential @xmath29 to the primordial curvature perturbation @xmath33 by the transfer function @xmath34 and the growth function @xmath35 ( which are separable functions in @xmath4cdm model ) via ( k , z)=t(k)d(z)(1+z)_k . note that we set the primordial ( initial ) bardeen potential in radiation dominated era as @xmath36 .",
    "consequently , the matter power - spectrum is related to the primordial curvature perturbation via p_l(k , z)=k_(k ) , where @xmath37 is the dimensionless power spectrum .",
    "usually the curvature perturbations power spectrum is parameterized as _ = a ( ) ^n_s-1 , where @xmath38 is the amplitude of the fluctuations at pivot wavenumber @xmath39 ( this value is from planck collaboration ) and @xmath40 is the spectral index which shows the scale - dependence of power spectrum .",
    "the constraints from the planck collaboration are @xmath41 and @xmath42 at @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the question we are interested to answer is _ if we put a feature in primordial curvature perturbations power spectrum , how does this affect the abundance of the structures in lss ? _ with the inclusion of feature in power spectrum , we schematically have [ eq : power - mod ] _ ( * k * ) = ( * k * ) + _ ( ) , in which @xmath44 is the standard isotropic and nearly scale - invariant primordial curvature perturbation power spectrum and @xmath45 is a scale - dependent feature added to the curvature power .",
    "consequently , the variance of matter perturbation from eq.([eq : power - mod ] ) is modified as follows ( m , z ; a_*)=|(m , z)+(m , z;a _ * ) , where @xmath46 is the variance in @xmath47 model obtained from @xmath48 and @xmath49 is its modification induced from the correction in primordial power spectrum . in this notation",
    ", @xmath50 is a symbolic parameter which collectively represents the set of the parameters which define the feature ( e.g. the amplitude of the feature or the location of feature in momentum space ) .",
    "the leading order correction in the variance is given by [ eq : deltasigma0 ] ( m , z;a _ * ) = d_k w^2(kr ) t^2(k ) _ ( ; a _ * ) , where @xmath51 is the solid angle of the spherical coordinates in the fourier space . in the case",
    "in which the correction to the power spectrum is isotropic we have [ eq : variance - change ] ( m , z;a _ * ) = k^3 dk w^2(kr ) t^2(k ) _",
    "( k;a _ * ) .",
    "the next step is to translate the effects of the corrections in variance to the number density of structures . for this purpose",
    ", we use the fact that the variance @xmath52 in @xmath4cdm model has a power - law relation with the radius ( mass ) of the enclosed over - dense region as follows @xcite [ sigma8 ] |_r(z)_*(z)()^- where @xmath53 is the normalization factor and @xmath54 is the fitting parameter . for the mass range @xmath55 , @xmath56 , accordingly the normalization parameter is @xmath57 and the parameter @xmath54 is approximately given by @xmath58 $ ] in which to leading order @xmath59 @xcite . for the mass range @xmath60 , @xmath61 , accordingly the normalization parameter is @xmath62 and the parameter @xmath63)$ ] . neglecting the logarithmic dependence of the variance to the mass ( this approximation introduces an error of less than @xmath20 ) , in these two intervals",
    "the mass function of the structures becomes [ eq : fwn ]    depends on the mass interval we are interested . in eq.([eq :",
    "fwn ] ) @xmath64 is the number density per mass of structures with the standard initial conditions , i.e. in the absence of the feature .",
    "now we define a new parameter , @xmath65 , as the fractional excess of the number density of the structures in the mass range @xmath7 , @xmath8 as follows [ eq : deltan ] _",
    "n ( m , z ; a_*)= where @xmath66 is the mass function of the structures in the presence of the feature in primordial curvature power spectrum collectively represented by the parameter @xmath50 .",
    "we also consider the fact that the number density of the structures can be calculated at any redshift .",
    "therefore , the change in number density depends on the redshift through the growth function @xmath35 which appears in the variance of the matter perturbation .",
    "now , assuming the universality of @xmath67 which is encoded in @xmath10 , @xmath68 at any mass scale is obtained to be [ eq : deltan1 ] _ n ( m , z ; a_*)=(m , z;a _ * ) , where a prime represents the derivative with respect to the height parameter @xmath19 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltan1 ] ) is obtained from the taylor expansion of eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltan ] ) with respect to change in variance induced from @xmath50 at a fixed mass . using the definition of height parameter ,",
    "( [ eq : deltan1 ] ) reduces to [ deltan1 ] _",
    "n(m , z ; a_*)= - . from this equation",
    "we see that the change in number density , @xmath68 , is proportional to the change in the variance @xmath69 induced by the primordial feature .",
    "we note that the proportionality factor is given by the logarithmic derivative of the universal mass function .",
    "consequently , an excess or deficit in variance does not have a uniform effect on all mass scales ; its effect is non - trivial which depends on the mass scale under consideration .    for the press - schechter universality function",
    "we have [ nps ] _",
    "n    @xmath70 is the change in number density at a specific mass @xmath7 .",
    "this change is a function of the mass through the height parameter .",
    "now consider the critical height @xmath71 with the critical mass @xmath2 which depends on redshift .",
    "the interesting point is that for the structures with the mass range @xmath72 in which @xmath73 , the number density contrast has an excess for @xmath74 while opposite conclusion is reached for @xmath75 in which @xmath76 .",
    "note that the sign flip for @xmath68 at the critical height parameter @xmath77 is a result of the gaussian probability distribution function ( pdf ) which is assumed in the press - schechter formalism . for a gaussian pdf with a fixed value of the density contrast",
    "@xmath78 the probability is maximum if the variance satisfies the relation @xmath79 . if one fixes the density contrast to the critical value @xmath80 , which is the definition of critical height parameter @xmath81 , then the maximum probability occurs at @xmath82 , or equivalently at @xmath83 .",
    "that is why @xmath68 for the collapsed objects as a function of the variance flips the sign at @xmath83 .",
    "a crucial point to discuss is that for the mass scales @xmath84 where @xmath85 , we are in quasi - linear regime where the structures are on the verge of formation and the density contrast is almost near the critical density @xmath86 ( the uncertainty comes from the fact that the condition of spherical collapse is @xmath87 which is not exactly equal to @xmath88 ) . accordingly , our result is more reliable for masses and redshifts in which @xmath89 while it is not applicable for @xmath90 .",
    "similarly , we can find the number density contrast for the sheth - tormen mass function as [ eq : deltanst ] _",
    "n    sheth - tormen number density contrast reduces to that of the press - schechter obtained in eq.([nps ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the critical height in which the big bracket in eq.([eq : deltanst ] ) vanishes is more complicated than the press - schechter function in which one simply has @xmath81 .",
    "this indicates that in a more realistic model of collapse the change in the statistics of dark matter halos is a non - trivial function of the mass scale @xmath2 which in itself is a redshift dependent quantity .",
    "we remark that in this work we assume that introducing a feature in primordial power spectrum does not invalidate the press - schechter procedure of structure formation .",
    "this means that the processes of barrier crossing , the magnitude of @xmath86 obtained from spherical collapse and the environment - independence of standard est do not change dramatically in the models we study in next section and the corrections are sub - leading .",
    "this is because the mechanism of collapse occurs in late time universe and it is almost scale - free .",
    "the inflationary models with feature mainly change the initial conditions of perturbations which to first order modifies the variance as we have discussed here .    with these model - independent analysis for @xmath91 and @xmath68 ,",
    "in section [ sec - iii ] we calculate these quantities for various features in curvature perturbation power spectrum presented in section [ theory ] .",
    "in this section we present three different kinds of anomalous features in inflationary power spectrum which will be used for the abundance of structures in next section .",
    "the reader who is not interested in mechanism of generating these features in inflationary model building can directly jump to section [ sec - iii ] . our discussions here will be brief , we only provide the motivations and the overviews of mechanisms generating the corresponding features . for detail studies ,",
    "we refer the reader to the extensive literature on each topic .",
    "first we consider models of inflation in which there is a sharp jump in curvature perturbations power spectrum in fourier space .",
    "mathematically , we parameterize this localized feature in power spectrum by [ eq - delta ] _",
    "= _ in which @xmath92 is the dirac delta function , @xmath93 is the usual nearly scale - invariant power spectrum while the amplitude of feature is represented by @xmath50 in units of @xmath94 . in order for this localized feature to be relevant for lss observations ,",
    "we require @xmath95 .",
    "we note that @xmath50 can be either positive or negative , corresponding respectively to an increase or a decrease in the primordial power spectrum .",
    "the idea of generating local features have been extensively studied in the literature . here",
    "we follow the mechanism employed in @xcite .",
    "the model contains two scalar fields @xmath96 and @xmath97 in which the light field @xmath96 is the inflaton field and the heavy field @xmath97 is the waterfall field .",
    "the potential is as in hybrid inflation @xcite given by [ potential ] v= ^2 + ( ^2 - ) ^2 + ^2 ^2 .",
    "however , unlike models of hybrid inflation , in this scenario inflation mainly proceeds as in chaotic model with potential @xmath98 with some effective mass @xmath99 which undergoes a small but abrupt change when @xmath96 reaches the critical value @xmath100 .",
    "the waterfall field @xmath97 is introduced to induce the change in mass . in this picture inflation",
    "has three stages as follows .    as in chaotic models",
    "inflation starts with a large super - planckian value , @xmath101 in which @xmath102 is the reduced planck mass , so one can obtain about 60 @xmath103-folds of inflation to solve the horizon and the flatness problems .",
    "as in hybrid inflation the waterfall field is very heavy during the first stage of inflation so it is stuck to its instantaneous minimum @xmath104 .",
    "however , once the inflaton field has reached the critical value @xmath105 , the waterfall field becomes tachyonic and it rapidly rolls towards its global minimum @xmath106 .",
    "this represents the second stage of inflation which may be taken to be very short for our purpose .",
    "the final stage of inflation , corresponding to @xmath107 , follows as in chaotic inflation but with the effective mass of the inflaton , @xmath108 , given by m_+^2 = m^2 + g^2 ^2 = m^2 ( 1 + ) , in which the constant @xmath109 is defined via @xmath110 .",
    "we assume the change in inflaton mass is small , corresponding to @xmath111 , so the slow - roll conditions are satisfied throughout inflation . in order to bring this local feature into the lss window",
    "we assume that the short waterfall stage begins when the lss modes @xmath112 leaves the horizon .",
    "typically , this corresponds to around 50 @xmath103-folds or so before the end of inflation .",
    "the details of correction in power spectrum and bispectrum have been studied in @xcite .",
    "the correction in power spectrum from waterfall @xmath113 compared to the original power spectrum coming from the inflaton @xmath114 is obtained to be [ powers - ratio ] 10 ^ 3 ^2 ( ) ^4 ( ) ^-10/3 , in which @xmath115 is the slow - roll parameter and @xmath116 is a parameter defined in @xcite measuring the sharpness of the phase transition . for a very sharp waterfall phase transition , we require @xmath117 , say @xmath118 . with @xmath119",
    "the above ratio can be as big as 10 . in principle by taking @xmath116 very big",
    ", one can make the duration of the waterfall phase transition ( the intermediate second stage of inflation ) as short as one desires . in this limit",
    ", we approach the localized feature presented in eq .",
    "( [ eq - delta ] ) .",
    "there are indications of power asymmetry in cmb map as observed by planck satellite @xcite , for earlier reports of hemispherical asymmetry in wmap data see @xcite .",
    "the observations indicate that the power spectrum in northern hemisphere is different than the the power spectrum in southern hemisphere . using the following dipole modulation on the cmb temperature fluctuations @xcite [ dipole - power0 ] t ( ) = ,",
    "in which @xmath120 is the statistically isotropic temperature fluctuations , @xmath121 is the amplitude of the dipole asymmetry , @xmath122 is the preferred direction in the sky , @xmath123 is the direction of the look to sky and @xmath124 is the angle between @xmath122 and @xmath125 , the planck collaboration has found @xmath126 and @xmath127 in galactic coordinates @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "whether this detection is statistically significant is under debate and we shall wait for the upcoming planck data release to see if the significance of the detection will improve .",
    "the best known method to generate a hemispherical asymmetry is the idea of long mode modulation @xcite . in this picture ,",
    "a long super - horizon mode with the wavelength @xmath128 modulates the curvature perturbations at the desired scales ( either the cmb or the lss scales ) .",
    "an observer probing a cosmological distance @xmath129 much smaller than the long mode ( @xmath130 can not probe the wave - like nature of the long mode . for this observer , the long mode only modifies the background quantities such as @xmath131 for the inflaton field or modulates the surface of end of inflation .",
    "this in turn induces a directional - dependence ( a gradient ) in power spectrum taking the form [ dipole - power ] _",
    "= _ . note that the additional factor 2 in the above formula compared to eq .",
    "( [ dipole - power0 ] ) is because @xmath132 .    for this picture to work",
    ", there should exist a coupling between the long mode @xmath133 and the smaller modes i.e. the cmb - scale or the lss - scale modes .",
    "this rings the bell for the relation between the amplitude of dipole asymmetry and the `` squeezed - limit '' non - gaussianity @xcite , however see @xcite for a different view . imposing the quadrupole constraints one finds @xcite @xmath134 .    with these discussions in mind ,",
    "in order to get large enough dipole asymmetry one has to start with a model with large enough squeezed - limit non - gaussianity .",
    "as is well - known from maldacena s analysis @xcite , many single field models of inflation fail to do this job .",
    "indeed , maldacena s non - gaussianity consistency condition @xcite implies that @xmath135 so one can not generate observable dipole asymmetry from the long mode modulation in conventional single field models of inflation .",
    "this argument also implies that one has to look for non - trivial models of inflation in which the maldacena s consistency condition is violated such as in curvaton models or in multiple fields models of inflation .",
    "the observations on sub - cmb scales indicate that dipole asymmetry becomes less significant for @xmath136 @xcite .",
    "this indicates a non - trivial scale - dependent dipole asymmetry , i.e. @xmath137 which should be considered in any theoretical modeling of dipole asymmetry .",
    "we take into account the upper bound imposed from @xcite when consideration the effects of dipole asymmetry on lss in next section .",
    "homogeneity and isotropy are two pillars of cosmological principles yielding the standard frw cosmology .",
    "there were indications of statistical anisotropies in wmap data @xcite , but the follow up analysis demonstrated that the systematic errors can accommodate the apparent source of quadrupole asymmetry @xcite . having this said ,",
    "the possibilities of violating statistical isotropy is intriguing both observationally and also from the theoretical point of view .",
    "indeed , it is likely that there is no statistical anisotropy at cmb scales but there may exist statistical anisotropy at lss scales .",
    "one interesting mechanism to generate statistical anisotropies are based on the dynamics of gauge fields .",

    "<S> we study the predictions of anomalous inflationary models on the abundance of structures in large scale structure observations . </S>",
    "<S> the anomalous features encoded in primordial curvature perturbation power spectrum are ( a ) : localized feature in momentum space , ( b ) : hemispherical asymmetry and ( c ) : statistical anisotropies </S>",
    "<S> . we present a model - independent expression relating the number density of structures to the changes in the matter density variance . </S>",
    "<S> models with localized feature can alleviate the tension between observations and numerical simulations of cold dark matter structures on galactic scales as a possible solution to the missing satellite problem . in models with hemispherical asymmetry </S>",
    "<S> we show that the abundance of structures becomes asymmetric depending on the direction of observation to sky . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we study the effects of scale - dependent dipole amplitude on the abundance of structures . using the quasars data and adopting the power - law scaling @xmath0 for the amplitude of dipole we find the upper bound @xmath1 for the spectral index of the dipole asymmetry . in all cases there </S>",
    "<S> is a critical mass scale @xmath2 in which for @xmath3 the enhancement in variance induced from anomalous feature decreases ( increases ) the abundance of dark matter structures in universe . </S>"
