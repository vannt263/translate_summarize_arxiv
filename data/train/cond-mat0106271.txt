    "since the exact solution of two  dimensional ising model has been found by onsager  @xcite , a study of various phase transition models is of permanent interest .",
    "nowadays , phase transitions and critical phenomena is one of the most widely investigated fields of physics .",
    "remarkable progress has been reached in exact solution of two  dimensional models  @xcite .",
    "recently , we have proposed  @xcite a novel method based on grouping of feynman diagrams ( gfd ) in @xmath19 model .",
    "our gfd theory allows to analyse the asymptotic solution for the two  point correlation function at and near criticality , not cutting the perturbation series . as a result",
    "the possible values of exact critical exponents have been obtained  @xcite for the ginzburg ",
    "landau ( @xmath19 ) model with @xmath1 symmetry , where @xmath20 is the dimensionality of the order parameter .",
    "our predictions completely ( exactly ) agree with the known exact and rigorous results in two dimensions  @xcite , and are equally valid also in three dimensions . in  @xcite , we have compared our results to some monte carlo ( mc ) simulations and experiments  @xcite .",
    "an additional comparison to mc data has been made in  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that the actually discussed mc data for 3d ising  @xcite and @xmath21  @xcite models are fully consistent with our theoretical predictions , but not with those of the perturbative renormalization group ( rg ) theory  @xcite .",
    "some data for 3d heisenberg model  @xcite also have been discussed in  @xcite . however , these data , likely , are not accurate enough and here we reconsider the estimation of the critical point based on more recent mc results . from the theoretical ( mathematical ) point of view",
    ", the invalidity of the conventional rg expansions has been demonstrated in  @xcite .",
    "the current paper , dealing with numerical analysis of the three ",
    "dimensional @xmath18 and ising models , presents one more confirmation that the correct values of critical exponents are those predicted by the gfd theory .",
    "here we discuss a @xmath19 model on a three  dimensional cubic lattice .",
    "the hamiltonian of this model , further called @xmath18 model , is given by @xmath22 where the summation runs over all lattice sites , @xmath23 is the temperature , @xmath24-\\infty ; + \\infty[$ ] is the scalar order parameter at the site with coordinate @xmath25 , @xmath26 is a unit vector in the @xmath27th direction , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are coupling constants . obviously , the standard 3d ising model is recovered in the limit @xmath30 where @xmath31 fluctuations are suppressed so that , for a relevant configuration , @xmath32 or @xmath33 holds .",
    "the mc data for the binder cumulant in this @xmath18 model have been interpreted in accordance with the @xmath34expansion and a perfect agreement with the conventional rg values of critical exponents has been reported in  @xcite . according to the definition in  @xcite ,",
    "the binder cumulant @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the magnetization and @xmath2 is the linear size of the system .",
    "based on the @xmath34expansion , it has been suggested in  @xcite that , in the thermodynamic limit @xmath17 , the value of the binder cumulant at the critical point @xmath38 and , equally , at a fixed ratio @xmath39 ( the precise value is not important ) of partition functions with periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions is a universal constant @xmath40 independent on @xmath29 .",
    "we suppose that the latter statement is true , but not due to the @xmath34expansion .",
    "it is a consequence of some general argument of the rg theory : on the one hand , @xmath35 is invariant under the rg transformation and , on the other hand , an unique fixed point ( not necessarily the wilson  fisher fixed point ) exists in the case of an infinite system , so that @xmath41 holds at @xmath17 and @xmath42 where @xmath40 is the fixed  point value of @xmath35 .",
    "the above conclusion remains true if we allow that the fixed point is defined not uniquely in the sense that it contains some irrelevant degree(s ) of freedom ( like @xmath43 and @xmath44 in the perturbative rg theory discussed in sec .",
    "2 of  @xcite ) not changing @xmath35 .",
    "the numerical results in  @xcite confirm the idea that @xmath45 holds at criticality , where @xmath40 is a universal constant independent on the specific microscopic structure of the hamiltonian .",
    "based on the idea that @xmath40 is constant for a given universality class , here we estimate the correction  to  scaling exponent @xmath0 . according to  @xcite , corrections to finite ",
    "size scaling for the magnetization of the actual 3d ising and @xmath18 models are represented by an expansion in terms of @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "one expects that the magnetization ( binder ) cumulant  ( [ eq : u ] ) has the same singular structure .",
    "since @xmath48 holds at a fixed ratio @xmath49 , a suitable ansatz for estimation of @xmath0 is  @xcite @xmath50 which is valid for any two different nonzero values @xmath51 and @xmath52 of the coupling constant @xmath29 .",
    "the data for @xmath53 can be read from fig .  1 in  @xcite ( after a proper magnification ) without an essential loss of the numerical accuracy , i.  e. , within the shown error bars .",
    "doing so , we have evaluated the effective exponent @xmath54 / \\ln 2 \\;,\\ ] ] i.  e. , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .",
    "these values are shown in fig .",
    "[ om ] by crosses .",
    "such an estimation , however , can be remarkably influenced by the random scattering of the simulated data points , particularly , at larger sizes where @xmath58 becomes small .",
    "this effect can be diminished if the values of @xmath58 are read from a suitable smoothened curve .",
    "a comparison to the original results ( without the smoothening ) provides some objective criterion of the accuracy of such estimations .",
    "we have found that @xmath58 within @xmath59 $ ] can be well approximated by a second  order polinomial in @xmath60 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ du ] .    without any claims about validity of such an approximation",
    "well outside of this interval , we can consider the least ",

    "these values are depicted in fig .",
    "[ om ] by empty circles . as we see , the results are similar to those obtained by a direct calculation from the original data points ( crosses ) .",
    "however , the values obtained from the smoothened curve ( circles ) are more accurate and reliable .",
    "as regards the smallest size , we suppose that the original estimate @xmath55 is accurate enough even without any smoothening , since the values of @xmath63 and @xmath64 are large relative to the statistical errors .",
    "in such a way , we see from fig .",
    "[ om ] that the effective exponent @xmath65 decreases remarkably with increasing of @xmath2 . according to gfd theory ,",
    "@xmath65 is a linear function of @xmath60 at @xmath17 , as consistent with the expansion in terms of @xmath46 where @xmath66 .",
    "more data points , including larger sizes @xmath2 , are necessary for a reliable estimation of the asymptotic exponent @xmath67 .",
    "nevertheless , already a row linear extrapolation in the scale of @xmath60 with the existing data points yields the result @xmath6 which is reasonably close to the exact value @xmath68 ( horizontal dashed line in fig .  [ om ] ) found within the gfd theory .",
    "the corresponding least  squares fit with circles ( at @xmath69 ) and cross ( at @xmath70 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ om ] by a straight solid line .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "[ om ] that the final result @xmath71 ( horizontal dot  dot  dashed line ) reported in  @xcite represents some average effective exponent for the interval @xmath72 $ ] .",
    "it has been claimed in  @xcite that the estimates for @xmath0 ( cf . tab .  2 in  @xcite )",
    "are rather stable with respect to @xmath73 , where @xmath73 is the minimal lattice size used in the fit .",
    "unfortunately , the analysis has been made in an obscure fashion , i.  e. , giving no original data , so that we can not check the correctness of this claim .",
    "besides , the estimates in tab .  2 of  @xcite has been made by using an ansatz @xmath74 which is worse than  ( [ omef ] ) .",
    "namely , ( [ omef ] ) and ( [ omef1 ] ) are approximations of the same order , but  ( [ omef1 ] ) contains an additional parameter @xmath40 which is not known precisely . the results of an analysis with the ansatz  ( [ omef ] ) , reflected in tab .  5 of  @xcite ,",
    "are not convincing , since only very small values of @xmath73 ( up to @xmath75 ) have been considered .",
    "in any case , we prefer to rely on that information we can check , and it shows that the claim in  @xcite that @xmath71 holds with @xmath76 accuracy can not be correct , since @xmath65 is varied in the first decimal place .",
    "we have made a similar estimation of @xmath0 for @xmath1symmetric spin models , namely , for the dynamically diluted @xmath21 ( @xmath77 ) model simulated in  @xcite ( @xmath78 ) and for @xmath79symmetric @xmath18 model simulated in  @xcite . in the case of the @xmath77 model , parameter @xmath80 ( cf .",
    "eq.(6 ) in  @xcite ) plays the role of @xmath29 in  ( [ omef ] ) .",
    "the data for the binder cumulant in fig .  1 of  @xcite look rather accurate , i.  e. , not scattered .",
    "this enables us to estimate @xmath81 just from the data at @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( @xmath21 model ) .",

    ", the solid circles can be well located on a smooth line which , however , is remarkably curved at smaller sizes . due to the latter reason",
    ", we have used only the last three points ( the largest sizes ) for the linear fit ( solid line ) resulting in an estimate @xmath7 which comes close to our theoretical value @xmath85    the estimates of @xmath81 for the @xmath79-symmetric @xmath18 model are depicted in fig .

    "the data have been extracted from fig .  1 of  @xcite at @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the obtained @xmath65 values at @xmath70 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 well lie on a straight line ( tiny  dashed line in fig .  [ om ] ) yielding an asymptotic estimate @xmath8 which is reasonably close to our theoretical prediction @xmath91 .",
    "hence , the @xmath92 value deviates upwards unexpectedly .",
    "we suppose , this is due to an inaccurate simulation of the largest size @xmath93 , as explained below .",

    "the data for @xmath102 also are available in  @xcite .",

    "[ m ] of the effective amplitudes at @xmath17 , it is possible only if both conditions are fulfilled , i.  e. , the exponents are correct and the mc data are accurate enough to ensure stable results .",

    "the cited there papers report results which disagree with the values of the critical exponents we have proposed . however , as regards the pure monte carlo study , we are quite confident that , just like in the actually discussed case of 3d ising model , the increase of system syzes and/or use of higher  level approximations will lead to the conclusion that fits with our exponents are better than those with the conventional ( rg ) exponents . particularly , a careful analysis of the effective exponents made in sec .

    "formally , the finite  size effects on the obtained values of the critical exponents has been taken into account in many of cases considered in literature",
    ". however , the estimated effect strongly depends on that which kind of corrections to scaling is expected and included in the analysis . all the existing analysis ( not counting our works ) , of course , are based on the assumption that the critical behavior of all physical quantities is characterised by the same correction exponent @xmath0 which is about @xmath226 for @xmath1symmetric models with @xmath227 .",
    "however , it is evident from the behavior of the partition function zeros of 3d ising model  @xcite that @xmath0 can not have so large value .",
    "namely , the value of @xmath228 should be about @xmath9 or even smaller , otherwise we arrive to a rather strong and obvious contradiction with the mc data for the real part of the partition function zeros  @xcite . the current analysis in sec .",
    "[ sec : omega ] provides @xmath10 independent evidences ( for @xmath101 ) that the correction exponent for the magnetization cumulant is remarkably smaller than @xmath226 .",
    "the numerical analysis often suggests that @xmath229 .",
    "this fact is perfectly explained by our theoretical concept : in some cases the amplitude of the leading correction term can be small as compared to that of the subleading term providing the effective correction exponent just about @xmath230 .",
    "the value of @xmath0 is crucial for an accurate correction  to  scaling analysis .",
    "if , e.  g. , we would assume that @xmath231 , then we could not arrive to a conclusion that @xmath232 is a better choice for the 3d ising model than @xmath160 , since all fits with @xmath158 and @xmath231 look relatively bad .",
    "this explains the fact that the usual estimations do not give @xmath233 , while this is just the correct value .",
    "we suppose that similar problems could arise also in other cases , particularly , if one uses some expression for the correlation length in finite system ( like in  @xcite ) , as it has been discussed in  @xcite .",
    "we should not forget also about purely subjective factor that any signals about essential inconsistency between mc data and rg predictions usually are suppressed , i.  e. , they do not apper in the published literature",
    ". there are no doubts that such signals exist which can be mentioned even very easily , e.  g. , the behavior of the effective critical exponents @xmath81 discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : omega ] , or those evidences in  @xcite which appear as a result of unsophisticated analysis of mc data . as a result of an uncritical acceptance of anything which claims to confirm with a great accuracy the conventional ( rg ) values of the critical exponents and rejection of any contraarguments , the objective picture is distorted",
    "this is the reason why almost all the published and reviewed papers usually claim to confirm with an almost unbelievable accuracy the predictions of the perturbative rg theory .",
    "it is impossible to check in detail all these papers , but our critical analysis in  @xcite , @xcite , and here indicates that many of them are , at least , inobjective .",
    "there exists some background for the conventional claims in the published literature that all the usual methods give consistent results which appear to be in a good agreement with the predictions of the perturbative rg theory .",
    "the perturbation expansions of the rg theory , as well as the techniques of high and low  temperature series expansion are merely not rigorous extrapolation schemes which work not too close to criticality . as a result",
    ", these methods produce some pseudo or effective critical exponents which , however , often provide a good approximation just for the range of temperatures not too close to @xmath234 ( critical temperature ) where these methods make sense and , therefore , agree with each other . according to the finite  size scaling theory , @xmath235 is a relevant scaling argument , so that not too small values of the reduced temperature @xmath236 are related to not too large sizes @xmath237 .",
    "therefore , one can understand that the mc results for finite systems often can be well matched to the conventional critical exponents proposed by high temperature ( ht ) and rg expansions .",
    "if , however , the level of mc analysis ( i.  e. , the level of approximations used ) is increased , then it turns out that the `` conventional '' critical exponents are not valid anymore , as it has been demonstrated in the current paper and in  @xcite .",
    "it is because the `` conventional '' exponents are not the asymptotic exponents .",
    "correct values of the asymptotic exponents have been found in  @xcite considering suitable theoretical limits instead of formal expansions in terms of @xmath238 ( at criticality , where @xmath239 is the wave vector magnitude ) or @xmath240 ( approaching criticality ) which are meaningless at @xmath241 and @xmath140 .",
    "these formal expansions lie in the basis of the rg expansions for the critical exponents .",
    "the founders and defenders of the perturbative rg theory , of course , will try to doubt our statement that the perturbative rg method is invalid at criticality .",
    "but it is impossible to doubt a mathematical proof .",
    "it has been proven in  @xcite that the assumption that the @xmath34expansion works and provides correct results at @xmath241 leads to an obvious contradiction in mathematics ( cf .",
    "sec .  2 in  @xcite ) .",
    "this fact alone can not be compensated even by an infinite number of numerical evidences supporting the `` conventional '' critical exponents coming from the rg expansions .",
    "our argument , based on the current numerical analysis , is the following .",
    "we have proposed here a very sensitive method ( i.  e. , a study of effective amplitudes ) which allows to test the consistency of a given set of critical exponents with the mc data including several ( in our case up to @xmath10 ) corrections to scaling .",
    "we have applied this method to one of the recent and most accurate numerical data for the susceptibility in 3d ising model , and have got a confirmation that our critical exponents are true .",
    "it would be not correct to doubt our results based on less sensitive methods and lower  level approximations .",
    "we prefer to rely just on the data of pure mc simulations becose of the following reasons .",
    "the so called monte carlo rg ( mcrg ) method is not free of assumptions related to approximate renormalization .",
    "we would like only to mention that the mcrg study in  @xcite of 3d ising systems of the largest ( to our knowledge ) available in literature sizes , i.  e. up to @xmath242 , has not revealed an excellent agreement with the usual predictions of the perturbative rg . in particular , an estimate @xmath243 has been obtained  @xcite which is smaller than the usual ( perturbative ) rg value @xmath244 , but still is larger than the exact value @xmath68 predicted by the gfd theory .",
    "the high  temperature series can not give more precise results than those extracted from the recent most accurate mc data , including the actual data of  @xcite , since these series diverge approaching the critical point .",
    "one approximates the divergent series by a ratio of two divergent series ( pade approximation ) , but it is never proven that such a method converges to the exact result .",
    "it is interesting to compare the mc and ht estimates of the critical point for the standard 3d ising model , i.  e. , @xmath150 ( mc )  @xcite and @xmath245 ( ht )  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the mc value is more accurate : if we look in  @xcite , where the estimation procedure is well illustrated , we can see that @xmath103 is definitely smaller than @xmath246 , and the error seems to be much smaller than the difference between both estimates @xmath247 . as we have mentioned already , our independent tests suggest that the error of the actual mc value is about @xmath106 .",
    "in summary of the present work , we conclude the following .    1 .   the leading correction  to  scaling",
    "exponent @xmath0 in @xmath1symmetric models on a three  dimensional lattice has been tested by analysing the recent monte carlo ( mc ) data .",
    "these tests have shown the incorrectness of some claims that @xmath0 has a very accurate value @xmath4 at @xmath5 . a selfconsistent infinite volume extrapolation yields row estimates @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 at @xmath5 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , respectively , in approximate agreement with the corresponding exact values @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 predicted by our recently developed gfd theory .",
    "2 .   considering the susceptibility data for 3d ising model at criticality  ( sec .",
    "[ sec : fit ] ) , we conclude that the fits made with our ( gfd ) critical exponents systematically improve relative to those made with the exponents given in  @xcite , as the system sizes grow and the approximation order increases .",
    "3 .   the numerical analysis of the effective critical exponents in sec .",
    "[ sec : omega ] and  [ sec : fit ] , as well as in sec .  6 of  @xcite has shown that the effective critical exponents deviate from the values predicted by the perturbative rg theory and converge towards those of the gfd theory at @xmath17 .",
    "the same behavior has been observed in the experiment with superfluid @xmath224 discussed in  @xcite .",
    "totally , these are @xmath225 independent evidences of such a behavior , suggesting that the above examples are not occasional or exceptional , but reflect a general rule . 4 .",
    "different sets of critical exponents ( one provided by gfd theory , another proposed in  @xcite ) predicted for the 3d ising model have been tested by analysing the effective amplitudes ( sec .",
    "[ imp ] and  [ stan ] ) .",
    "while the usual fits of the susceptibility data do not allow to show convincingly which of the discussed here sets of the critical exponents is better , this method clearly demonstrates that the conventional critical exponents @xmath160 and @xmath71  @xcite are false , whereas our ( gfd ) values @xmath158 and @xmath47 are true .",
