    "quantum correlations , such as entanglement and quantum discord , are considered as valuable resources for quantum information task @xcite . on the other hand , in general ,",
    "entanglement and discord are quite different from each other . since the entanglement seems not to capture all the quantum features of quantum correlations , other measures of quantum correlations",
    "are proposed .",
    "quantum discord is a widely accepted one among them @xcite .",
    "the quantum discord plays an important role in the research of quantum correlations due to its potential applications in a number of quantum processes , such as quantum critical phenomena @xcite , quantum evolution under decoherence @xcite and the dcq1 protocol @xcite .",
    "since quantum discord quantifies the quantum correlation in a bipartite state and might also be a resource in quantum - information processing , it is interesting to study its distribution property in the multipartite system . the monogamy property which characterizes the restriction for sharing a resource or",
    "a quantity is helpful to provide significant information for this issue and deserves systematic investigation . in general , the limits on the shareability of quantum correlations are described by monogamy inequalities @xcite .",
    "recently , the monogamy relation for quantum discord was studied in @xcite .",
    "it is found that the monogamy of quantum discord is not always hold for any tripartite pure state @xcite .",
    "that is to say , the polygamy relation for quantum discord can hold for some states .    recently , a quantum correlation similar as quantum discord called one - way unlocalizable quantum discord was presented @xcite .",
    "the one way discord has an operational interpretation , for any tripartite pure state , the polygamy relation always holds .",
    "it is interesting to study the difference and connection between one way discord and quantum discord .",
    "the distribution property of one way discord in multipartite system is also worth considering . in this paper , we present the concept of polygamy deficit of one way discord . for any tripartite pure state , using the equivalent expression of polygamy deficit , we can control the polygamy degree of one way discord .",
    "for 4-partite pure states , we provide an condition for the case that one way discord is polygamy .",
    "we believe that our results provide a useful method in understanding the distribution property of one way discord .",
    "our results get rid of the optimal measurement problem , which is difficult or even impossible to overcome in most researches on one way discord and quantum discord , and give important relations to simplify the calculation , therefore , we believe that our results may have great applications in quantum information processing and can be applied to physical models of many - body quantum systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we give a brief review of the definition of one way discord and corresponding correlations . in sec .",
    "iii , we study the differences and connections between one way discord , quantum discord and corresponding quantum correlations . in sec .",

    "the polygamy degree of one way discord is considered .",

    "v , we summarize our results .",
    "in order to study the distribution property of one way discord , we give a brief review of one way discord and corresponding correlations .    for a bipartite state @xmath0 , the one - way unlocalizable quantum discord is defined as the difference between the mutual information and the one way unlocalizable entanglement @xcite , namely , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is mutual information @xcite .",

    "the definition of quantum discord is similar as one way discord , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the classical correlation which defined as @xmath12.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for any tripartite pure state , we have the koashi - winter relation @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the entanglement of formation ( eof ) of @xmath15 .",
    "similarly , we have the buscemi - gour - kim equality @xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the entanglement of assistance ( eoa ) of @xmath15 , which is defined by the maximum average entanglement of @xmath15 @xcite , @xmath18 where the maximum is taken over all possible pure - state decompositions of @xmath15 , satisfying @xmath19 and @xmath20 . here , @xmath21 is the von neumann entropy @xcite .",
    "the one way discord and quantum discord are two similar quantum correlations . the differences and connections between them are interesting questions . in this section",
    ", we study this issue carefully .",
    "first of all , let us consider the difference between one way discord and quantum discord .",
    "according to the definitions , we have @xmath22 using eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] ) , we have @xmath23 this formula tells us an interesting fact that the difference between one way discord and quantum discord for @xmath0 is equivalent to the difference between eoa and eof for @xmath15 .    we know that the one way discord is greater than or equal to the quantum discord in general , but how to measure the difference between them ? for an arbitrary tripartite pure state , this equation tells us that the difference can be measured by the difference between eoa and eof for another two parties . since the eof and eoa do not contains measurements , it is much easier to calculate the difference between them , which provides an simple method for measureing the difference between one way discord and quantum discord .",
    "if @xmath24 changes from a pure state to another pure state , the change of both sides of this equation are equivalent . in other words",
    ", we can control the difference between this two kinds of quantum discord by adjusting the corresponding entanglement measure .",
    "in particular , when eoa and eof are equal , the two kinds of quantum discord are equivalent .    now we give a simple example . in fig .",
    "1(a ) , for the ghz state @xmath25 ( @xmath26 $ ] ) , the @xmath27 is plotted as a function of @xmath28 .",
    "this figure shows that the difference between one way discord and quantum discord for @xmath0 first increases then decreases with increasing @xmath29 . in particular , when @xmath30 or @xmath31 , the state is separable and we have @xmath32 .",
    "when @xmath29= @xmath33 , the state is the maximally entangled state , the difference between one way discord and quantum discord for @xmath0 reaches the maximum value .",
    "consider the distribution property of one way discord , we provide an interesting relationship as follows : @xmath34 here we give a simple proof . using the definition and buscemi - gour - kim equality",
    ", we have @xmath35 , with @xmath36 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath37 and @xmath38 , similarly . combined these two equations , we have @xmath39 for quantum discord , using the koashi - winter equality , we have @xmath40 , and @xmath41 . the difference between @xmath42 and @xmath43",
    "is equivalent to @xmath44 , which completes the proof .",
    "this equation gives us another interesting fact that the difference between one way discord of @xmath0 and @xmath45 is equivalent to the difference between quantum discord of the same states .",
    "both of them are equal to the conditional entropy @xmath46 or @xmath47 .",
    "that is to say , the difference is independent of measure and the quantum correlations we used . for any tripartite pure states ,",
    "if @xmath48 is greater than or equal to @xmath49 , we have the conditional entropy @xmath50 , which means the one way discord or quantum discord of @xmath0 is always greater than or equal to @xmath45 , and vice versa .",
    "this formula also gives a new physical meaning for the conditional entropy : it reflects the distribution property of one way discord or quantum discord for relevant states .",
    "it tells us that if we want to control the distribution of one way discord or quantum discord between @xmath0 and @xmath45 , we only need to adjust the corresponding conditional entropy .",
    "if @xmath24 changes from a pure state to another pure state , the change of both sides of this equation are equivalent .",
    "for example , we consider a state , @xmath51 with @xmath52 and @xmath53 the bell states . in fig .",
    "1(b ) , the difference between one way discord or quantum discord of @xmath0 and @xmath45 is plotted as a function of @xmath28 ( @xmath54 $ ] ) .",
    "this figure shows that the difference between one way discord or quantum discord of @xmath0 and @xmath45 decreases from @xmath55 to @xmath56 with increasing @xmath29 .",
    "in particular , when @xmath29= @xmath33 , the conditional entropy @xmath46 is equal to zero , the one way discord or quantum discord of @xmath0 and @xmath45 are equal .",
    "in order to study the distribution property of one way discord carefully , similar as the quantum discord , we give two kinds of polygamy deficits of one way discord @xcite , @xmath57 the @xmath58 involves the local measurements on @xmath5 , @xmath59 and a coherent measurement on @xmath60 , while the @xmath61 only involves local measurements on @xmath9 .",
    "the first kind of polygamy deficit can be rewritten as @xmath62 here we give a simple proof . for tripartite pure states , we have @xmath63 . using the formulas we have proved",
    ", the polygamy deficit can be re - expressed as @xmath64 using the buscemi - gour - kim equality @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) , we have @xmath67 .    according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the one way discord is polygamy for tripartite pure states , but we do not know the degree of polygamy for a particular state .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) shows us that the degree of polygamy for one way discord is determined by the difference of ue and eoa .",
    "that is to say , we can control the degree of polygamy by adjusting the difference of ue and eoa for corresponding reduced state .",
    "the polygamy deficit can be reduced by decreasing the difference of ue and eoa .",
    "it is worth noting that the right hand side of this equation only contains one local measurement on @xmath5 or @xmath59 , so the experiment and calculations can be greatly simplified .",
    "the difference of ue and eoa for @xmath0 and @xmath15 change in the same step , we only need to consider one of them .",
    "now we consider the equivalent expression of the second polygamy deficit of one way discord . for tripartite pure states",
    ", we have @xmath68 , where @xmath69 . since we have proved in the previous section that @xmath70 with ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "it can be rewritten as @xmath71 for tripartite pure states , we have @xmath72 this equation tells us an interesting fact that the second polygamy inequality also holds for one way discord , since @xmath73 always holds for tripartite pure states .",
    "that is to say , both the first polygamy inequality contains local and coherent measurements and the second polygamy inequality only contains local measurement hold for one way discord .",
    "the polygamy degree of the second polygamy inequality is decided by the difference of @xmath74 and @xmath75 . in other words",
    ", we can control the polygamy degree by adjusting the mutual information and eoa for @xmath76 .",
    "it is worth noting that the right hand side of this equation does not include any measurement , so the experiment and calculations can be greatly simplified . we can also prove that @xmath77 it shows that the second polygamy deficit is equivalent to the difference between ue and one way discord for @xmath78 or @xmath79 , which change in the same step . in particular , when @xmath80 , we have @xmath81 and @xmath82 , @xmath83",
    "now we provide a simple example . in fig .",
    "2(a ) , for the ghz state @xmath25 ( @xmath26 $ ] ) , the @xmath84 is plotted as a function of @xmath85 .",
    "this figure shows that the second polygamy deficit of one way discord first decreases then increases with increasing @xmath29 . in particular , when @xmath86 or @xmath31 , the state is separable state , we have @xmath81 .",
    "when @xmath29= @xmath33 , the state is maximally entangled state , the polygamy degree of the second polygamy inequality reaches maximum , @xmath87 .    similarly , for 4-partite pure state , we define the two kinds of polygamy deficits as follows : @xmath88 we can provide an upper bound of these two polygamy deficits : @xmath89 . since @xmath90 , we have @xmath91 when mutual information is polygamy @xmath92 , we must have @xmath93 .",
    "so far , similar as the polygamy deficit for tripartite states , we have defined the two kinds of polygamy deficits for 4-partite pure states .",
    "we have provided an upper bound for these two polygamy deficit , which is equivalent to the interaction information for its tripartite reduced state @xmath24 .",
    "in general , the @xmath94 can be positive or negative .",
    "when @xmath92 , we have that the two kinds of polygamy inequalities hold for one way discord .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath95 holds for any tripartite reduced state @xmath24 .",
    "that is to say , when the mutual information is polygamy for @xmath24 , we must have @xmath92 , then both polygamy inequalities of one way discord hold for @xmath96 .",
    "so we can make the polygamy inequalities hold by adjusting the tripartite interaction information @xmath94 or the corresponding mutual information .",
    "since @xmath94 does not include any measurement , the experiment and calculations are very simple .",
    "for example , we consider a family of states , @xmath97 ( @xmath26 $ ] ) . in fig .",
    "2(b ) , the half of the interaction information is plotted as a function of @xmath28 .",
    "this figure shows that @xmath98 first decreases then increases with increasing @xmath29 .",
    "in particular , when @xmath86 or @xmath31 , the state is separable and the polygamy deficits are upper bounded by 0 . when @xmath29= @xmath33 , the state is the maximally entangled state , the polygamy deficits are upper bounded by -@xmath99 .",
    "that is to say , the one way discord is always polygamy for this state .",
    "in summary , we have considered the distribution property of one way discord for multipartite quantum systems .",
    "we have showed that the difference between one way discord and quantum discord equals to the difference between entanglement of assistance and entanglement of formation .",
    "the distribution property of one way discord for tripartite pure state have also been investigated .",
    "moreover , we have introduced the concepts of two polygamy deficits for one way discord of which we have found the equivalent expressions . using this result ,",
    "we can obtain physical interpretations for these two polygamy deficits and control the polygamy degree of one way discord regardless of the optimal measurement problem .",
    "for 4-partite pure states , we have provided an condition for the case that one way discord is polygamy .",
    "that is to say , if our condition is satisfied , the one way discord must be polygamy .",
    "we believe that our results provide a powerful but computationally simplified method in understanding the distribution property of one way discord in multipartite quantum systems .",
