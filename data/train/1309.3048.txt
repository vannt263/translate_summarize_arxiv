    "such thermoelectrics have not yet been discovered despite intensive efforts .",
    "consequently , the recent observation of colossal thermoelectric power ( tep ) in fesb@xmath1 amounting to tens of mv / k @xcite at @xmath5@xmath810k has been receiving considerable attention .",
    "fesb@xmath1 is a new , @xmath9-electron based correlated semiconductor closely resembling fesi @xcite . with the origin of the enhanced tep of fesi in debate for decades @xcite , the observations in fesb@xmath1 , with the thermoelectric power factor the largest ever reported @xcite , have added timely interest to this concern . accumulating experimental facts have confirmed the significant effect of electron - electron correlations in fesb@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "these include the large spectral weight redistribution up to higher energies @xcite and the occurrence of electronic griffiths phases at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "the sign of the colossal tep in fesb@xmath1 is negative , in agreement with the dominating electron band as revealed by hall - effect measurements in the same window , @xmath5@xmath630k ( cf.fig.1 , inset ( a ) ) .",
    "however , conventional electronic structure calculations @xcite can only qualitatively produce the tep profile , with the values being only one tenth of the measured ones .    in this work",
    ", we report on the nernst coefficient @xmath2 , tep @xmath0 and magnetoresistance ( mr ) of fesb@xmath1 in comparison to the isostructural compound feas@xmath1 . the latter compound does not exhibit significant effects of electron correlations or is only weakly correlated @xcite . in fesb@xmath1 , the simultaneously enhanced values of @xmath0 , @xmath2 and mr@xmath3 , as well as the striking similarity between the latter two quantities , evidence , as we will argue , a highly dispersive relaxation time @xmath4 of the charge carriers to be at the heart of these enhanced quantities .",
    "further support to this argument comes from the significant mismatch between the electrical and thermal hall mobilities of fesb@xmath1 , which forms a basis for our theoretical interpretation of the enhanced nernst signal using a dispersive @xmath4 .",
    "by contrast , for feas@xmath1 , @xmath2 and mr@xmath3 show values which are two orders of magnitude smaller , with its tep being well captured by the dft approach assuming an energy - independent @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "single crystals of fesb@xmath1 and feas@xmath1 were prepared by self - flux and chemical vapor transport techniques , respectively .",
    "details of sample synthesis and structure characterization have been described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the sample of fesb@xmath1 employed in this work is a 4.6@xmath112@xmath110.3mm@xmath12 slab cut along the @xmath13 axis of the marcasite structure , after orientation by the laue diffraction .",
    "we stress that this particular sample has been used for all the transport measurements discussed in the present paper . for the measurements of thermal properties including thermoelectric power , nernst effect and thermal conductivity , we employed a home - made setup equipped with one chip resistor of 2000 @xmath14 as heater and one thin ( @xmath15 @xmath16 25 @xmath17 m ) chromel - aufe@xmath18 thermocouple for detecting the temperature gradient @xcite . electrical resistivity and hall - effect measurements",
    "were performed on the physical property measurement system ( ppms ) from quantum design .",
    "while a significant sample dependence is not unusual for a narrow - gap semiconductor , the one observed in the transport properties of fesb@xmath1 is surprisingly large .",
    "for example , different to the purely semiconducting behavior observed along all the crystallographic axes by us , petrovic and coauthors @xcite reported that fesb@xmath1 crystals may show a metal - insulator transition along the @xmath13-axis , depending on the conditions of decanting after the flux growth .",
    "here we focus particularly on the sample dependence of thermoelectric power .",
    "the single crystals of fesb@xmath1 prepared by us exhibit a colossal tep minimum at around 10 k , which , depending on the sample quality , amounts to a value between -10 and -45mv / k @xcite . due to the high thermal conductivity which amounts to about 500 w / mk at around 10 k , thermal measurements on this compound require to pay very careful attention on thermal stability . for this reason",
    ", we used a very small temperature gradient during the thermal measurements which was typically 0.002@xmath11@xmath5 , with @xmath5 being the sample base temperature .",
    "we have confirmed these minimum values of tep by different measurement techniques that include the original and modified thermal transport options on ppms ( cf .",
    "@xcite and its supplementary material ) , as well as the home - made setup employed in this work .",
    "we recognized that the tep minima reported by the groups of petrovic and takahashi , which are obtained on the original ppms platform , are roughly one order of magnitude smaller ( 1@xmath192 mv / k ) @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in these cases , the thermoelectric power factor , @xmath20 , could be much larger than our observations due to a reduced electrical resistivity @xcite .",
    "it is unfortunate that no thermal conductivity results are available for those fesb@xmath1 samples @xcite , except for the sample in ref .",
    "@xcite , which exhibits a metal - insulator transition and therefore prevents a direct comparison with our thermal conductivity data .",
    "another interesting point is that the smaller tep minima of fesb@xmath1 single crystals in the literature were observed either to span over a large temperature region between 10 and 20 k @xcite , or at a rather higher temperature , 20 k @xcite , in comparison to 10 k as observed by us .",
    "this may hint at a better quality of the samples used in this work .",
    "for example , a tiny amount of electron doping by te ( 0.05% ) into the sb sites can shift the tep minimum to 30 k , with its magnitude reduced by more than one order of magnitude @xcite . in support of the peculiar thermal transport in fesb@xmath1 , recently , in the isostructural semiconductor crsb@xmath1 , a huge tep minimum of @xmath194.5 mv / k at 18 k and thermal conductivity comparable with that of fesb@xmath1 were reported by sales @xmath21 @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "an increase of the electrical resistivity , @xmath23 , by 4 orders of magnitude upon cooling from rt to 2k evidences a high quality of the current fesb@xmath1 crystal ( cf.fig.1 ) . as had been reported for various fesb@xmath1 samples @xcite , a shoulder in @xmath23",
    "is observed between 10 and 20k . applying the thermal activation law to @xmath23 between 40 and 100k yields an energy gap @xmath24@xmath2528mev , which can be reasonably explained by the electronic structure calculations only when taking electron - electron correlations into account through , e.g. , hedin s gw approximation @xcite . at even lower temperatures ( @xmath5@xmath615k )",
    ", @xmath23 is found to be dominated by a small activation energy of @xmath266mev .",
    "these transport features were found to be rather robust against varying sample quality and crystallinity , except for a sample - dependent activation energy ( @xmath60.1mev ) which can be estimated from the nearly flat @xmath23 below 6k .",
    "the transport properties in this low - temperature region ( @xmath5 @xmath6 6 k ) are assumed to be influenced by impurity bands and are therefore excluded from our focus in this work . for feas@xmath1 , thermal activation behavior of @xmath23 was confirmed above 200k ( fig.1 ) , with @xmath24@xmath26200mev .",
    "the metallic behavior between 50 and 180k in this compound presumably is caused by in - gap impurity states .",

    "in the temperature window of interest , i.e. , 6@xmath1930k , the electrical transport of fesb@xmath1 is dominated by the high - mobility electron band @xcite , in line with the sublinear @xmath29 curves as shown in the inset(b ) of fig.1 . upon warming the compound up to above 40k ,",
    "while we find the high - mobility band still to be of electron character , it could be hole - like in other samples @xcite . given a dominating one - band transport in the feas@xmath1 sample @xcite , the two compounds investigated here have a similar carrier concentration below 30k ( cf .",

    "is strongly enhanced as well .",

    "a similar @xmath2 curve with double - peak profile has already been observed in another fesb@xmath1 crystal @xcite .",
    "all these anomalies in the @xmath2 curve can actually find their counterparts in @xmath0 , e.g. , the main peak of @xmath2 at 7k concurs with a jump in @xmath0 , as indicated by the gray vertical line .",

    "we wish to particularly stress that the @xmath2 and the mr@xmath3 curves of fesb@xmath1 are surprisingly similar concerning their complex temperature profiles .",

    "[ nus.eps ] ]    the huge nernst coefficient of fesb@xmath1 with a maximum of 3.2mv / kt at 7k dwarfs that of feas@xmath1 ( fig.2(b ) main panel and inset ) by two orders of magnitude .",
    "this difference of @xmath2 in magnitude is extremely prominent when compared to that in tep : @xmath0 of feas@xmath1 assumes a peak below 20k amounting to 7mv / k , i.e. , a value as large as 40% of that in fesb@xmath1 . as we will discuss below in terms of @xmath35/@xmath36 , where @xmath36 is the hall mobility ( cf .",
    "fig.4 ) , even if the largely differing hall mobilities of the two materials are taken into account , such a large difference in @xmath2 is surprising .",
    "on the other hand , the large values of tep in feas@xmath1 are well captured by dft @xcite , which predicts a reasonable charge gap of @xmath260.2ev as observed experimentally @xcite . because of the much smaller charge gap ( @xmath2628mev ) , the colossal tep observed in fesb@xmath1 is far beyond the upper bound ( @xmath261.5mv / k ) set up in the coherent electron diffusion picture@xcite .",
    "a dominant phonon - drag contribution has been frequently assumed in order to explain the enhanced tep in fesb@xmath1 @xcite . however ,",
    "this is doubtful because ( i ) in feas@xmath1 , while the thermal conductivity @xmath30 is larger than that of fesb@xmath1 by a factor of 10 ( fig.2(a ) , inset ) , compatible with an enhanced phonon - drag contribution , @xmath0 can nevertheless be reasonably explained within the dft frame ; ( ii ) the phonon - drag effect may contribute to the nernst effect as well , as observed , e.g. , in the semimetal bi @xcite . in fesb@xmath1 , however , the complex profile of @xmath2 shows striking resemblance to that of mr(@xmath5 ) , instead of @xmath30 as is usually expected for dominating phonon - drag thermoelectric transport . since mr@xmath3 is free of phononic transport , our observations in fesb@xmath1 strongly argue against a phonon - drag scenario , providing evidence for both @xmath2 and mr@xmath3 being dominated by a common electronic origin .     and",

    "the nernst effect measures the transverse electric field @xmath48 and can be rooted to the difference of two mobilities ( for more information , refer to the appendix ) , @xmath49 where @xmath50=@xmath51 defines the tep , @xmath36=@xmath52 is the hall mobility and can be simply estimated by computing @xmath53 .",

    "the electrical and thermal hall mobilities , @xmath36 and @xmath54 , as derived from our measured data presented in figs.1 - 2 and eq.1 are shown in fig.4 for both fesb@xmath1 and feas@xmath1 . for the latter compound , @xmath54 and @xmath36",
    "are practically on top of each other and approximately constant over a large temperature range .",
    "by contrast , there is a significant difference between these two quantities for fesb@xmath1 .",
    "tracing the enhanced nernst signal in fesb@xmath1 to the mismatch in the two mobilities , in our opinion , is an important step forward in the understanding of this material .",
    "the divergent behavior of @xmath54 as well as the rapid decrease of @xmath36 above 30k for fesb@xmath1 are partly ascribed to an ambipolar effect in the presence of two carrier bands of opposite signs .",
    "this situation is supported by hall - resistivity measurements : above 30 k , @xmath29 changes its curvature ( cf .",
    "fig.1 , inset ( b ) ) , indicating that the low - mobility band changes from electron to hole like ( note that the high - mobility band remains electron like ) . as discussed by bel @xmath21",
    "@xmath22 @xcite , in a compensated two - band system , @xmath56 where the subscript denotes the sign of the carriers in the respective band .",
    "following the explanation in ref.@xcite , one readily knows that while @xmath57 and @xmath58 have the same sign , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are opposite in sign , as is also evident from the opposite hall signals of @xmath61 and @xmath19 bands . on the other hand , the peltier conductivity @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( therefore @xmath50 of the two bands )",
    "have opposite signs , whereas @xmath64 and @xmath65 have the same sign .",
    "therefore these combinations lead to an enhancement of @xmath54 and a decrease of @xmath36 above 30 k. our following discussions apply only to the lower temperature range ( 6 @xmath19 30",
    "k ) where we assume a one - band approximation to be adequate .    in order to demonstrate the role of a dispersive @xmath4 in various transport coefficients",
    ", we employ a model of conventional semiconductor , where the chemical potential @xmath17 = @xmath19@xmath66 , with @xmath66 being the activation energy .",
    "the conduction band is approximated in terms free electrons with an effective mass @xmath67 , @xmath68@xmath16@xmath69 .",
    "this dispersion is supplemented with a scattering rate that has a linear energy dependence , @xmath70@xmath25@xmath71+@xmath72@xmath68 , where @xmath71 is the scattering rate of charge carriers at the bottom of the conduction band , and @xmath72 is a dimensionless parameter .",
    "note that the linear energy dependence is the simplest dispersion of @xmath70 , which is employed here in order to demonstrate the impact of an asymmetry of @xmath70 on the transport properties , rather than to capture the physics in fesb@xmath1 . in the boltzmann framework",
    ", we have shown that all components of the conductivities @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( cf.eq.1 ) can be expressed in terms of @xmath67 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath72 ( refer to the appendix ) .",
    "as shown in the appendix , when @xmath72@xmath16 0 , i.e. , @xmath70 being energy independent , the mobilities @xmath54 and @xmath36 cancel exactly , generalizing the sondheimer cancellation theorem of the nernst effect .",
    "this is consistent with the analytical explanation made for typical metals , where @xmath35@xmath75 @xmath76@xmath77/@xmath78 @xcite .",
    "the nonvanishing , and in fact large , nernst coefficient ( or , more precisely , the large mismatch between @xmath54 and @xmath36 ) in fesb@xmath1 indicates that a strong energy - dependent scattering rate plays an important role in the thermoelectricity of this compound .",
    "this is also evident in the large values of mr@xmath3 in fesb@xmath1 , in comparison to feas@xmath1 ( cf .",
    "fig.3 ) : in the formalism as employed above , the mr can be expressed with the same set of parameters , and it vanishes as well when @xmath72=0 .    bearing in mind our proposition of a common underlying origin of @xmath35 and mr ( cf . the appendix ) , it is interesting to note the striking similarities observed between these two quantities for fesb@xmath1 as a function of temperature , as revealed by fig.3 .",
    "to our knowledge , this phenomenon has never been reported for any other compound .",
    "qualitatively similar mr@xmath3 with double peaks was also observed by hu @xmath21",
    "@xmath22 @xcite .",
    "there , however , the peak at the high-@xmath5 side ( @xmath2630k ) is nearly two orders of magnitude larger than that of our observations , compatible with the metal - insulator transition of their samples .",
    "a slight shift of the double peaks in mr@xmath3 to higher temperatures upon increasing field is observed in fig.3 , indicating the involvement of the spin degrees of freedom in the relevant charge - carrier relaxation processes .",
    "notice , however , that even a large value of @xmath72 is not enough to account quantitatively for the observed @xmath2 of fesb@xmath1 , suggesting that the assumed linear energy dependence of @xmath70 can not correctly capture the correlation effects in fesb@xmath1 .",
    "a more complicated dispersion of @xmath70 has to be considered in order to make comparison with the experimental results .",
    "in addition , impurity states and/or phonon - drag effect which could lead to a difference between @xmath54 and @xmath36 may also play a role to some extent .    as shown in the inset of fig.3 ,",
    "the mr@xmath3 of feas@xmath1 measured at 4 t spans vertically a range which is a factor - of-50 smaller than that for fesb@xmath1 .",

    "different to fesb@xmath1 , no obvious correlation can be observed between @xmath2 and mr@xmath3 for this compound .",
    "instead , we found that the mr(@xmath5 ) curve scales well with the @xmath33 curve in feas@xmath1 , as expected for a conventional semiconductor @xcite .",
    "the energy - dependent scattering processes in fesb@xmath1 can also be highlighted by simply computing the ratio @xmath35/@xmath36 in units of @xmath39 .",
    "this is because in a nondegenerate semiconductor ,",
    "@xmath79 @xcite , if @xmath4 obeys a power law function , @xmath4@xmath75@xmath80 .",
    "a similar scaling between nernst coefficient and hall mobility has indeed been demonstrated for various metallic systems in ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath4 has been assumed to obey a linear function of energy , i.e. , @xmath81 = 1 . as shown in the inset of fig.4 , the ratio @xmath35/@xmath36 in units of @xmath39 , as a measure of the power @xmath81 , is unrealistically large for fesb@xmath1 .",
    "whereas in feas@xmath1 , it is of order unity as anticipated for , e.g. , acoustic - phonon or ionized - impurity scattering @xcite .",
    "this difference , again , hints at a highly energy - dependent scattering rate in fesb@xmath1 that is presumably related to the substantial electron - electron correlations in this compound .",
    "this may be a local resonant scattering similar to that operating in kondo systems @xcite , or incoherent electronic transport beyond the landau quasiparticle picture as realized in doped mott insulators @xcite .",
    "the thermoelectric power of a conducting solid is related to its energy - dependent electrical conductivity @xcite .",
    "consequently , @xmath50 arises from the energy dependence of the two crucial components of electrical conductivity at the fermi energy : the electronic density of states and the relaxation time @xmath4 . among them ,",
    "the latter effect is of minor importance for most materials @xcite .",
    "however , we have recently shown for the prototype kondo lattice compound cecu@xmath1si@xmath1 that its @xmath2 and @xmath0 are simply related by the electrical hall mobility @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "physically , this occurs only when the dispersive @xmath4 is the dominating cause of the enhanced thermoelectric power as well as the nernst coefficient , free of the sondheimer cancellation that occurs when @xmath4 is independent or only weakly dependent on energy .",
    "along the same line , a strongly energy - dependent scattering mechanism , as indicated for fesb@xmath1 by the largely and similarly enhanced nernst coefficient and magnetoresistance , is supposed to play a significant role in the pronounced thermoelectricity . theoretically , we propose to trace the enhancement of nernst coefficient in fesb@xmath1 to the mismatch between the thermal and electrical hall mobilities as observed in this material .",
    "we show that the mismatch of the two mobilities can stem from a dispersive scattering rate of the charge carriers , though our assumption of a linear energy dependence is too simple to capture the physics in fesb@xmath1 .",
    "the unique scattering mechanism indicated for fesb@xmath1 , which is absent in the uncorrelated band semiconductor feas@xmath1 , appears to be related to substantial electron - electron correlations , as manifested by a large ( factor of 20@xmath1950 ) renormalization of the charge - carrier mass in slightly te - doped fesb@xmath1 @xcite . a proper theory of fesb@xmath1 explaining this mass renormalization and the dispersive @xmath4 has still to be developed .",

    "the hall mobility @xmath36 and its thermal counterpart @xmath54 are simply @xmath121 eq .  [ eq : mu_gamma0 ] does not require the non - degenerate limit , thus it is more general than eqs .",
    "[ eq : rho_gamma0 ] and [ eq : s_gamma0 ] .",
    "therefore , @xmath36 and @xmath54 exactly cancel out in the nernst effect , @xmath122 , leading to a vanishing @xmath35 . also , the two terms on the right hand side of eq .",
    "[ eq : mr_exp ] cancel each other , leading to vanishing magnetoresistance as well .",
    "if the scattering rate is simply linear in energy , @xmath123 , we have following results in the non - degenerate limit , @xmath124 thus the temperature dependence of @xmath31 and @xmath50 is dominated by the activation energy @xmath66 , similar to the results of the non - dispersive relaxation .",
    "the hall mobility is @xmath125 the thermal mobility @xmath54 is @xmath126 the @xmath127 term in eq .",
    "[ eq : mu_t_a ] is the subleading order in the non - degenerate limit .",
    "therefore , @xmath54 and @xmath36 do not cancel and give rise to a non - vanishing @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath128 but we emphasize that the difference between @xmath36 and @xmath54 , @xmath129 should be small at the non - degenerate limit , and vanishes with decreasing temperature . therefore",
    ", our analysis shows that while a linear dispersion of @xmath70 is able to produce a finite nernst signal , obviously , it is not consistent with the experimental results in fesb@xmath1 , especially in the low temperature range where the colossal seebeck and nernst coefficients are measured .",
    "therefore , a complex but realistic dispersion of @xmath70 is yet to be identified for fesb@xmath1 in future .    similarly , the magnetoresistance is @xmath130 notice the @xmath131-function @xmath132 is divergent .",
    "this divergence is artificial , because @xmath133 this divergence can be eliminated by a small but finite @xmath117 or a realistic band structure . therefore mr will be proportional to @xmath134 .",
    "as we see in the main paper , in feas@xmath1 , mr scales with @xmath134 over a wide temperature range , whereas this is not the case for fesb@xmath1 .",
