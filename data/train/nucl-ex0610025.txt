    "the quest to use energetic heavy ion collisions to infer properties of infinite nuclear matter , such as the equation of state ( eos ) under conditions of density ( or pressure ) and temperature significantly different from the ground state conditions has proven to be a difficult task , although an impressive amount of data has been obtained using experimental setups of increasing sophistication . at incident energies per nucleon on the order or smaller than the rest masses , systems consisting of two originally separated nuclei",
    "are small in the sense that surface effects can not be neglected even if some kind of transient equilibrium situation were achieved .",
    "in particular , the mean free paths of pions  @xcite , @xcite , the most abundantly created particles , with momenta below 1 gev / c are neither large nor small compared to typical nuclear sizes",
    ". therefore methods of analysis resting on the validity of either of these two extremes in the hope to simplify the theoretical description are bound to lead only to qualitative success at best . as a result ,",
    "event simulation codes based on microscopic transport theory were soon developed  @xcite that allowed for multiple elementary collisions as the heavy ion reaction proceeds , without however requiring a priori full equilibration .",
    "an important lesson that was learned in the last two decades was that definite conclusions on nuclear matter properties based on a single observable had proven to be premature and/or of limited accuracy , aside from not being sufficiently convincing .",
    "as an example , original hopes  @xcite,@xcite to use deficits in pion production relative to expectations based on compression - free scenarios were not supported by transport theoretical simulations  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    on the other hand transport calculations  @xcite showed that pion azimuthal correlations , flow , qualify as an observable that could contribute significant constraints on the eos .",
    "however , as pion production in the 1a gev regime ( at sis ) is not as copious as it is in higher energy regimes and as pion azimuthal correlations turn out to be rather small ( an effect of a few percent ) , it was concluded  @xcite that _ very high statistics and high - precision impact parameter classification are necessary _ to exploit the sensitivity of pion flow to the eos .",
    "this requires the need for large acceptance detection systems capable of registering under exclusive conditions a much larger number of events than had been possible with the berkeley streamer chamber that was operated in the 80 s to obtain pion data at the bevalac accelerator  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the first electronic @xmath5-detector capable of measuring pions was diogene  @xcite installed at the saturne synchrotron in saclay .",
    "the pion emission data presented in this work were obtained with a large acceptance , high granularity device , fopi  @xcite installed at the sis accelerator in darmstadt .",
    "particle identification is based on time - of - flight , energy loss and magnetic rigidity measurements with use of large volume drift chambers and scintillator arrays .",
    "a second large acceptance device  @xcite , based on the use of a time projection chamber , was also operated in the nineties at the bevalac accelerator in berkeley .",
    "in addition , more specialized devices were build and used at the sis accelerator in darmstadt : kaos  @xcite , a high resolution magnetic spectrometer and taps  @xcite , based on arrays of baf@xmath6 detectors allowing to identify neutral pions and @xmath7 particles via their two - photon decay branches .",
    "the experimental situation concerning the pion observable before the advent of these newer devices was reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite , some of the more recent particle production data obtained in the nineties at the sis accelerator and also at other accelerators ( ags and sps ) covering higher energies have been summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our collaboration has published pion data before  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , but these were more limited in scope and , in particular , did not treat pion flow and isospin dependences . also , we call attention to the fact that the data of ref .",
    "@xcite ( for au on au at @xmath8 gev ) have been revised and should be superseded by the present data ( see section [ experiment ] for details ) .",
    "the aim of the present work is to present a more complete systematics of highly differential pion emission in heavy ion reactions obtained with the fopi device , varying the incident energy ( from 0.4 to @xmath9 gev ) , the system s size ( from @xmath10 to @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 , are the projectile and target mass number , respectively ) and the system s isospin , and , of course , the event selection method i.e. the centrality .    after describing the experimental methods we report on the following observables for charged pions of both polarities :    * longitudinal and transverse rapidity distributions and stopping ; * polar anisotropies ; * pion multiplicities ; * transverse momentum spectra ; * ratios @xmath4 of average transverse momenta and of yields ; * directed flow ; * elliptic flow .",
    "while discussing each of these subjects , we shall refer more explicitly to relevant earlier work and compare data where possible .",
    "all along we shall also present the results of simulations with a transport code showing the degree to which our data can be understood on a microscopic level and assessing conditions for equilibration ( stopping ) , sensitivities to assumptions on the eos and the propagation of pions in the medium and searching for signals that might give information on the isospin dependence of the eos . while pions present a probe of hot and compressed matter of high interest in its own right",
    ", it is also important to have this observable under firm theoretical control as it is a link to understanding the production of strangeness under subthreshold conditions where the pion emitting baryonic resonances are thought to play an essential role in the collision sequences leading to outgoing strange particles , such as kaons .",

    "particle tracking was based on the hough transform method , ht .",
    "track quality cuts were varied systematically and the results extrapolated to zero cuts to achieve estimates of the tracking efficiency .",
    "the relative efficiency of positively and negatively charged pions was inferred from studies of the isospin symmetric system @xmath1ca+@xmath1ca .",
    "an alternative method of data analysis with a local tracker , lt , has also been used allowing extensive cross checking .",
    "this method is documented in ref .",
    "@xcite and we shall briefly come back to it in section  [ iqmd ] .    the measured momentum space distributions of pions do not cover the complete @xmath5 phase space and must be complemented by interpolations and extrapolations .",
    "in the ht method , we filter the data to eliminate regions of distorted measurements ( such as edge effects ) and correct for efficiency where necessary .",
    "since this study is limited to symmetric systems , we require reflection symmetry in the center of momentum ( @xmath23 ) . choosing the @xmath23 as reference frame , orienting the z - axis in the beam direction , and ignoring for the moment deviations from axial symmetry ( see section [ azimuthal ] )",

    "this procedure smoothens out statistical errors and allows subsequently a well defined iterative extension to gaps in the data . within errors the smoothened representation of the data follows the topology of the original data : typical deviations are @xmath58 i.e. of a magnitude that exceeds statistical errors in most cases and is caused by local distortions of the apparatus response , thus revealing typical systematic uncertainties .",

    "the dependence on the incident energy was very weak and therefore was ignored .",

    "one of the motivations for numerical simulations of heavy ion reactions with transport codes is the possibility to investigate the effect of the underlying equation of state , eos , on the experimental observables without relying on the restrictive assumption of local ( and _ a fortiori _ global ) equilibrium followed by sudden freeze - out of all elementary hadronic collisions . in between collisions",
    ", nucleons are propagating in mean fields , the nuclear parts of which correspond in the limit of infinite matter to well defined zero temperature eos .",
    "these eos can be chosen to be stiff or soft , as characterized in terms of incompressibilities @xmath83 mev , respectively 200 mev , where @xmath84 near @xmath85 , the saturation density .",
    "we shall henceforth label these two options , hm , respectively sm .",
    "the m in hm and sm stands for the momentum dependence of the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "iqmd incorporates a phenomenological ansatz fitted to experimental data on the real part of the nucleon - nucleus optical potential . in the iqmd code pions",
    "are produced by the decay of the 1232 mev @xmath86 baryon resonance and may be reabsorbed exclusively by forming a @xmath86 again . the dominance of the lowest nucleonic excitation in the @xmath87 gev energy regime has been directly demonstrated in proton - pion correlation studies @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "while in between collisions , the @xmath86 baryons are propagating in the same nuclear and coulomb fields as the nucleons , pions are feeling only the coulomb potential . for simplicity , and in order to limit the number of input variables we shut off the poorly known ( isospin ) symmetry potential in these exploratory calculations .",
    "thus isospin effects , if any , would have to result either from the isospin dependent nn cross sections ( implemented in the code ) , e.g. a cascade effect , and/or the coulomb fields . as in the model pion production and absorption",
    "is strongly connected with @xmath86 baryon production and absorption , the physics of @xmath86 propagation in the medium becomes important both for the observed final number of pions and the flow pion daughters inherit from their parents. if not otherwise stated we have used in our calculations the scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath86 baryon mass distribution and width .",
    "some recent implementations of transport theoretical codes for heavy ion collisions in the @xmath87 gev regime contain more advanced features than those just described . without attempting to be complete , we mention the works of bao an li and coworkers  @xcite and of the catania group  @xcite which implement various isospin dependences of the _",

    "the code of danielewicz  @xcite includes nucleonic clusters up to mass three and has been used in our context here to clarify the role of expansion on the pion observables .",
    "very recently , the relativistic code urqmd has also been used  @xcite to study sis energy reactions , although its original design  @xcite was directed towards much higher energies .",
    "most of these codes include the influence of many higher baryonic resonances .",
    "one of the advantages of a qmd type code over buu ( boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ) implementations might be its capability to induce finite ( nucleon ) number fluctuations without resorting to additional assumptions or recipes .",
    "for the simulation of the experimental situation it is of paramount importance that there is an accurate centrality matching. i.e. the centrality criterion of the experiment ( here the observable @xmath74 ) and its realistic fluctuations should be simulated .",
    "we vary @xmath89 uniformly between 0 and 1 and add the events ( about 50000 per system - energy ) weighed by @xmath89 .",
    "[ b - au1500 ] shows @xmath89 distributions resulting from @xmath74 selection in two of our standard centrality intervals .",
    "the nominal @xmath89 intervals are also shown , as well as the effect of applying a filter that takes into account the geometrical and the threshold limits of the apparatus .",
    "as can be seen this filter does not have a dramatic influence on the distributions , and hence its details are not critical .",
    "however , the effect of using @xmath74 , rather than the experimentally elusive @xmath89 , is not negligible , even with a perfect detector . for the energy range of interest here",
    ", we find that the alternative selection method , binning charged particle multiplicities , yields less sharp @xmath89 distributions as long as @xmath90 , but is competitive for more peripheral collisions .",
    "in particular , multiplicity binning avoids the high @xmath89 tails beyond @xmath91 visible in the figure .",
    "multiplicity selected data are available , but will not be shown here . @xmath74 has the advantage that it does not require the simulation to reproduce the degree of nucleonic clusterization , a difficult ( still ) task for transport codes ( see ref .",
    "finite number effects deteriorate the @xmath89 resolution when lighter systems , such as ca+ca , are studied , an additional reason to try to be realistic when simulating the experiment .",
    "we have also used the iqmd code with a more technical aim : we have introduced it  @xcite as an event generator for a geant based  @xcite monte carlo simulation of our apparatus response to better assess tracking efficiencies and losses due to geometrical limitations .",
    "this alternative independent data analysis  @xcite using a local tracking method , lt , instead of the hough - transform based tracker , ht , was found to yield @xmath5 pion multiplicities in good agreement ( @xmath92 or better ) with the method outlined above ( e.g. see figs .",
    "[ ruru ] and [ sumpion ] in section  [ production ] ) .",
    "before looking at special projections in momentum space it is useful to display the full ( 2-dimensional ) distributions @xmath93 .",
    "one such distribution was already shown in fig .",
    "[ uty6 ] for au+au at @xmath49 gev . to see the evolution of the topology with incident energy - i.e. from @xmath94 to @xmath95 gev - two more such distributions",
    "are shown in the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ uty ] .    the pion ( here @xmath50 ) sources",
    "are centered at midrapidity with no readily evident memory of the initial conditions ( i.e. around @xmath96 ) . comparing the contours at @xmath94 gev with those at @xmath95 gev ,",
    "one notices that in the scaled units chosen for these plots , the distributions are significantly wider in both dimensions at the lower energy .",
    "the data at @xmath94 gev span more than twice the full rapidity gap .",
    "at least two properties involved in pion production are not expected to scale : a ) the nucleonic fermi motion which should be relatively more important at the lower energy and b ) the decay kinematics of the parent @xmath86 ( and other ) baryonic resonances .",
    "the simulation with iqmd ( see the lower panels ) qualitatively reproduces the higher compactness at @xmath95 gev , but is less expanded in the longitudinal direction , especially at the lower energy .",
    "a more quantitative assessment of these features can be made in terms of longitudinal , @xmath97 , and transverse , @xmath98 , rapidity distributions deduced from the reconstructed @xmath5 data . due to apparatus limitations , and in order to keep the technical definition of the scaled variances of these distributions strictly constant over the full range of system - energies and centralities , we define the variances @xmath99 , resp .",
    "@xmath100 , of these distributions in the finite interval @xmath101 for pions .",
    "further we define the ratio @xmath102 which we shall loosely call degree of stopping or just stopping. in a non - relativistic purely thermal interpretation this ratio would represent the ratio of transverse to longitudinal temperatures , which , if different from one , would then imply non - equilibrium . in fig .",
    "[ vary ] we show measured excitation functions for @xmath99 , @xmath103 and of @xmath104 ( symbols indicated in the figure ) .    the scaled variances are seen to decrease significantly and steadily with incident energy , as expected from the qualitative discussion of fig .",
    "the pionic stopping is consistently below one , but decreases less rapidly with energy .",
    "we also include from our earlier work  @xcite the nucleonic stopping ( dotted ) for comparison : it decreases faster with energy than its pionic counterpart .",
    "some of the difference between pions and nucleons results from the fact that the observed pionic momenta result from a convolution of the excited nucleon momenta with the decay kinematics , a convolution that is expected to lead to a more homogeneous ( isotropic ) final momentum distribution . a more subtle effect would be that different hadrons witness _ on the average _ different collision histories in a non - equilibrium situation .",
    "these effects should be taken care of in a microscopic simulation .",
    "the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ vary ] are the prediction of iqmd sm which follow the measured transverse variances amazingly well , but show a flatter trend for the longitudinal variances coming closer to the data at the highest energy and underestimating the measured values at the low energy end , confirming again trends seen qualitatively in fig .",
    "[ uty ] . as a consequence the stopping",
    "is also overestimated especially at the low energy end . the mean field ( sm versus hm ) has a modest , but not negligible , influence : the stiffer eos leads to a general increase of the stopping ( uppermost dashed line ) by roughly @xmath58 caused by the correlated decrease / increase of the longitudinal / transverse variance .",
    "naively , if stopping is incomplete , the degree of stopping is expected to depend on the system s size characterized by the total number of nucleons , @xmath105 .",
    "our data comprise the systems ca+ca ( @xmath106 ) , ru+ru ( @xmath107 ) and au+au ( @xmath108 ) where we roughly double the nucleonic size from one system to the next . in order to compare",
    ", we keep the centrality in _ scaled _ impact parameters constant ( @xmath76 ) . in terms of participants one can also vary the ( participant ) system size @xmath109 , by changing the impact parameter @xmath89 , keeping @xmath105 constant .",
    "( in order not to interrupt the flow of arguments here , we refer the reader to section  [ production ] for a definition and discussion of @xmath109 . ) with the concept of participant size , we are then in a position to establish with our data a summary of the pion stopping systematics , based on the two methods just discussed , see fig .  [ vartlapart ] and its caption . in the figure",
    "we have plotted averages for both polarities , @xmath110 and @xmath50 , as no significant difference was observed .",
    "the main message of this systematics ( which is reproduced semiquantitatively by the simulation ) is that there is no unique dependence on @xmath109 , but also a dependence on either the shape of the participant volume ( which depends on the collision geometry , hence @xmath89 ) , or on the presence of more or less spectator matter in the early stages of the reaction , an interpretation we favour in the present energy regime .",
    "the idea is that pions , being fast moving _ light _",
    "hadrons ( notice in fig .",
    "[ uty ] some pions are seen to freeze out with 4 - 5 times the incident nucleon velocities @xmath111 ) are able to penetrate into the spectator matter before the latter has left the neighbourhood of the participant zone .",
    "these pions are then rescattered experiencing a partial longitudinal reacceleration .",
    "this results in a smaller apparent stopping , an effect that increases with the size of the spectator matter , as suggested by fig .",
    "these pion ( or @xmath86 baryon ) rescatterings in spectator matter also influence the anisotropies of azimuthal emissions  @xcite to be discussed later .",
    "in thermal model analyses of pion data ( see for example @xcite ) it is often assumed that pion emission is isotropic in the c.o.m . in order to extend to @xmath5 the measured mid - rapidity data .",
    "however , already early studies  @xcite of inclusive reactions have reported deviations from isotropy : usually the polar angle distributions have a minimum near @xmath112 c.o.m .. more recently , the taps collaboration has observed  @xcite anisotropic @xmath113 emission in asymmetric heavy ion systems at subthreshold energies and interpreted the inclusive data in terms of a primordial pion emission followed by final state interactions ( rescattering and absorption ) . the averaging over impact parameters and",
    "the presence of asymmetrically distributed spectator matter in the chosen reactions complicate the microscopic interpretation of such data . in the present work",
    ", the fact that the stopping observable @xmath104 ( see previous section ) was found to be less than one , indicates that isotropy is not fulfilled even in the most exclusive central collisions , despite minimal amounts of shadowing spectator matter .    to quantify anisotropy",
    "it is useful to pass from the coordinates @xmath114 to spherical coordinates @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the polar and @xmath117 the azimuthal angle .",
    "this coordinate change does not introduce new information , of course , but allows to define observables that show deviations from isotropy more directly and more sensitively , especially when @xmath104 is only slightly below 1 .",
    "the distributions @xmath118 such as those shown in fig .",
    "[ uty ] were transformed to spherical coordinates duly taking into account the jacobian .",
    "[ dndo ] shows the projection onto the polar angle axis for au+au at @xmath87 gev for various centralities .",
    "we define as anisotropy factor @xmath119 the ratio @xmath120 where @xmath121 is least squares fitted to the data .",
    "@xmath119 is the factor with which a measurement restricted to @xmath112 ( c.o.m . ) or to mid - rapidity , has to be multiplied to correct the measured yields for deviations from isotropy . for the cases shown in fig .",
    "[ dndo ] we find @xmath122 ( for @xmath123 ) and @xmath124 ( for @xmath125 ) .    in terms of our @xmath119",
    "the anisotropy measured  @xcite for central collisions @xmath1ar + kcl at @xmath126 gev , @xmath127 , compares well with our values of @xmath128 and @xmath129 for @xmath130 central collisions of @xmath1ca + @xmath1ca at 1.5 and @xmath131 gev , respectively .",
    "the polar angle anisotropies can not be explained in the framework of thermal models .",
    "the simulation with iqmd , however , does a reasonable job for this observable , aside from the absolute normalization to be discussed later ( see right panel of fig .",
    "[ dndo ] ) .",
    "high polar angle anisotropies suggest that a significant fraction of the _ observed _ pions must be produced and emitted close to the system s surface where they can escape without rescattering .",
    "one could conjecture that some , potentially more thermalized , pions ( or nucleonic resonances ) created deeper inside the system did not reach the detectors because of in - medium absorption .",
    "more systematic details reveal differences between the data and the simulations . while stopping ( fig .",
    "[ vary ] ) shows a weakly decreasing trend with increasing energy , the measured excitation function of @xmath119 looks rather flat ( within the indicated systematic errors ) , see fig .",
    "[ aniso - e ] , while the iqmd simulations always underestimate @xmath119 and predict a rise with beam energy which is slightly more pronounced with the softer eos .",
    "the observables of anisotropy , @xmath119 , and of stopping , @xmath104 , are not equivalent since they quantify different aspects of momentum space population .",
    "however , they are related to the degree that high transparency that would yield @xmath132 should be characterized by @xmath133 .",
    "the two branches seen in the stopping when varying either the size of the system or the geometry , fig",
    ".  [ vartlapart ] , are also seen with the anisotropy observable , fig .",
    "[ anisoapart ] .",
    "iqmd simulations reproduce these features qualitatively .",
    "a somewhat puzzling feature is the fact that the measured data seem to suggest that the anisotropy grows slightly with @xmath109 when the centrality is kept high ( @xmath76 ) .    in fig .",

    "[ brill ] ( i.e. limiting the rapidity range to @xmath349 ) we indeed find that @xmath110 and @xmath50 flow are very similar , although integration over a larger @xmath350 interval reveals a small enhancement of @xmath110 flow as we saw above .",
    "we also note that another statement in ref .",
    "@xcite that _",
    "the pion data indicate little dependence on the impact parameter _ is not properly characterizing our data for @xmath351 .    in fig .",
    "[ flow - v2 ] we present a comparison of measured elliptic flow with results from simulations .",
    "following a similar line as for directed flow ( fig .",
    "[ flow - v1 ] ) we present large acceptance data for @xmath326 , @xmath352 and isospin differential @xmath353 flow , @xmath354 , in au on au collisions at @xmath95 gev framed by simulations using a soft ( left panels ) and stiff ( right panels ) eos .",
    "qualitatively , the trends of the simulations are similar to those of the data , the stiff eos again being somewhat closer to the data , although still a little on the short side .",
    "the systematic @xmath333 difference is well reproduced , see the upper row of panels in fig .",
    "[ flow - v2 ] . as already noticed for directed flow ( fig .  [ flow - v1 ] ) , the phase shift prescription for the @xmath86 baryon lifetime leads to a moderate ( and statistically marginal ) modification of the predicted elliptic flow ( dotted curve in the lower left panel for @xmath50 ) .",
    "this work presents for the sis energy regime of heavy ion collisions the most encompassing pion systematics available today .",
    "while some of the presented data are just a ( needed ) confirmation of earlier pioneering work , a significant number of observations are new .    among the data which urgently needed a confirmation ,",
    "are pion multiplicities .",
    "one important conclusion from our present study is that two pion detection systems that were able to measure and publish pion multiplicities in heavy ion reactions in the @xmath87 gev regime with acceptances close to @xmath5 , the bevalac streamer chamber and fopi at sis / darmstadt , now offer highly consistent results ( fig .  [ harris ] ) . in the larger framework of using heavy ion collision data to infer properties of nuclear matter far off the ground state",
    ", this should encourage future theoretical efforts to understand pion production in the @xmath87 gev regime on a level of @xmath92 , the experimental uncertainty that is , presently still , typical for most absolute pion observables , and in particular the multiplicities . extending the truly pioneering streamer chamber data ,",
    "our present data give information on two pion charges , @xmath110 and @xmath50 , and hence do not require non - trivial assumptions on the isospin dependences in order to deduce the multiplicity of all pions .    also , our systematics in terms of system sizes and system isospin is now enlarged . as a result of this improvement , we can now say that pion multiplicities per participant are not strictly a constant for a given incident energy , but show a measurable trend towards smaller values as the participant number is increased , an effect that on the @xmath92 level does not depend on how the system size is varied , be it by varying the overlap zone changing the centrality , or by modifying target and projectile ( fig .",
    "[ powerlaw ] ) .",
    "most of the progress since the eighties , however , rests on the detailed , centrality selected truly three - dimensional momentum space populations that have now become available .",
    "in contrast with just integrated @xmath5 multiplicities which require large ( and well understood ) acceptances rather than a multitude of registered events , many subtle and relatively small effects , such as asymmetries in pion emission , required electronic devices such as fopi to be able to handle the wealth of information connected with the variation of energy , centrality , system size and system isospin . complemented with the studies of the taps and the kaos collaborations there now exists a rather complete set of informations on pion emission .    in two ( scaled ) dimensions , longitudinal rapidity , @xmath350 , and transverse four - velocity , @xmath355 , the pions peak at mid - rapidity populating , especially at low energy , a rather broad phase space extending over at least twice the original rapidity gap . in these scaled units the distributions become significantly more compact at the higher end of the studied energy range ( fig .",
    "[ uty ] ) .    rather than presenting the longitudinal ( beam ) direction in terms of a rapidity distribution on a linear scale , and then switch to a logarithmic ordinate scale to present the transverse direction in terms of a transverse mass or momentum distribution , as is commonly done in the literature ,",
    "we have compared the two orthogonal directions more directly introducing the ( one - dimensional ) transverse rapidity distributions .",
    "the scaled variances of the transverse and the longitudinal rapidity distributions decrease significantly with increasing beam energy ( fig .  [ vary ] ) , the transverse variance always being the smaller of the two . we have dubbed the ratio of the transverse to the longitudinal variance stopping and find that this observable decreases steadily with increasing incident energy , although more slowly than the individual variances , which in a naive thermal model ( equilibrium , no flow , no decay distortions ) would relate directly to ( kinetic ) temperatures and would have to be independent of the direction .",
    "this pion stopping qualitatively follows the nucleon stopping @xcite , the latter decreasing however faster with energy , probably a reflection , on average , of a less violent collision history , due in part to a less perfect separation of spectator type influences .",
    "however , we also found evidence for spectator influence on the pions , although created particles originate in this energy regime from the overlap zone . when studying the size dependence of pion stopping , we found a remarkable phenomenon of two stopping branches : while stopping in the most central collisions is almost independent of the system size , very much in contrast to nucleon stopping  @xcite , and even seems to increase slightly as the size decreases , an effect that is highly non - trivial , we find that stopping decreases when significant spectator matter is present ( i.e. in half - overlap , @xmath286 , collisions ) .",
    "we associate this observation ( fig .",
    "[ vartlapart ] ) tentatively to a reacceleration of pions penetrating and rescattering in the fast spectator ( in the c.o.m .",
    "system ) . since there was no significant indication of two corresponding branches in pion _ production _",
    ", one is tempted to conclude that pions are rescattered , rather than absorbed by spectator matter .      the partial transparency that is suggested by the observation that the stopping observable is always less than one",
    ", is also evidenced by a marked polar anisotropy of pion emission ( fig .",
    "[ dndo ] ) which again shows the two branches depending on the presence or absence of spectators ( fig .",
    "[ anisoapart ] ) .",
    "anisotropies imply that extrapolations of midrapidity data to @xmath5 that assume isotropic emission underestimate pion yields typically by a factor 1.2 to 1.4 .",
    "when we apply this correction factor to taps or kaos midrapidity data , we find fair agreement with the data from large acceptance devices , however some problem cases remain ( figs .",
    "[ taps ] , [ powerlaw ] ) .",
    "our transverse momentum spectra , that agree in shape with kaos ( fig .",
    "[ kaos ] ) , and also with the iqmd simulation ( fig .",
    "[ pt ] ) , are characterized , besides the variance ( or apparent transverse temperature ) by a marked difference between @xmath110 and @xmath50 that is suggested by the simulation to originate almost exclusively from the coulomb fields ( fig .",
    "the latter also account for the main features of the systematics of ratios of average momenta ( fig .  [ ptratio ] ) .    whether the symmetry part of the ground state eos influences the yield ratios of @xmath50 to @xmath110 in neutron rich nuclei is not clear .",
    "the naive expectation from the first chance isobar model that this ratio should grow quadratically with @xmath218 is generally not fulfilled , as the ratio tends to vary linearly with @xmath218 due to a partial thermalization effect , except at the lowest energy ( @xmath94 gev ) .",
    "simulations seem to miss this low energy trend , however ( figs .",
    "[ piratio ] , [ bali ] ) .",
    "this work also provides a significant extension of data on pion azimuthal correlations , especially for the directed flow which is of special interest due to its apparent sensitivity to the eos ( fig .",
    "[ flow - v1 ] ) @xcite .",
    "the rapidity dependence @xmath283 has the s - shape familiar from the early days of flow measurements  @xcite and is well described in terms of an odd polynomial in @xmath350 including just a linear and a cubic term ( fig .",
    "[ v1-au1500 ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the ultrarelativistic regime  @xcite where the flow of pions appears to be mostly opposite to proton flow ( antiflow ) , we find in the @xmath87 gev regime a more complex behaviour .",
    "first , for high centralities , @xmath356 , the flow of the pions follows the nucleon flow although it is considerably smaller in terms of @xmath230 , roughly by the ratio of pion to nucleon mass . for larger impact parameters",
    "there is a switch to antiflow ( figs .",
    "[ v1-au1500 ] and [ kintner ] ) .",
    "second , the flow of positively charged pions differs from that of negatively charged pions , in particular the switch to antiflow occurs at smaller centrality ( fig .",
    "[ kintner ] ) .",
    "although these features confirm qualitatively what was found in an earlier study by the eos collaboration  @xcite , the quantitative agreement is not satisfactory ( fig .  [ kintner ] ) : whether the difference is due to different detector acceptances is not clear .      despite theses",
    "detailed features which show that pion flow is a complex phenomenon , it is useful for systematics purposes to try to characterize flow by just one parameter .",
    "one alternative is the midrapidity slope @xmath357 , for which we have established a systematics varying the incident energy ( fig .",
    "[ v1slop - au ] ) : this parameterization puts more weight on the midrapidity region . another alternative , stressing higher rapidities , consists of the large - acceptance value of @xmath230 , for which we have established size ( fig .",
    "[ v1-asys ] ) and isospin ( fig .",
    "[ v1-iso ] ) dependences .",
    "the isospin differential flow of pions is a systematic effect which is largest for au + au at the lower incident energies ( fig .",
    "[ v1slop - au ] ) .",
    "it seems to be dominated by coulomb effects since it is quantitatively reproduced by our simulation for au+au at @xmath95 gev ( fig .",
    "[ flow - v1 ] ) which did not include isospin dependent mean fields except for the coulomb field .",
    "however , surprisingly , the isospin differential pion flow was found to be significantly smaller for @xmath2zr + @xmath2zr ( @xmath358 ) than for @xmath2ru + @xmath2ru ( @xmath359 ) , fig .",
    "[ v1-iso ] .",
    "quantitatively , it seems necessary to introduce a nuclear isospin field of opposite sign to the coulomb part of the field in order to explain this feature .",
    "the simulation at @xmath95 gev ( fig .",
    "[ flow - v1 ] ) showed that the eos influences pion directed flow in a measurable way , favouring the stiffer eos in the iqmd version that we used .    in the @xmath87 gev energy range pion elliptic flow like",
    "nucleonic flow is negative , i.e. preferentially out - of plane .",
    "the presence of spectator matter in the expansion phase of the fireball is probably the most important geometrical difference to the ultrarelativistic regime  @xcite , our stopping studies indicating that pion rescattering in spectator matter plays a role , as was already suggested in ref .",
    "we find that @xmath324 is rather flat over a very large range of rapidities ( fig .",
    "[ v2-au1500 ] ) .",
    "in contrast to directed flow , @xmath360 increases nearly linearly with decreasing centrality in the range covered by our data ( @xmath361 ) .",
    "the transverse four - velocity dependence @xmath329 ( fig .  [ v2ut - au1500 ] ) is quadratic ( @xmath50 ) or linear ( @xmath110 ) for smaller momenta , flattening out at higher momenta .",
    "we confirm the tabulated kaos data  @xcite for @xmath50 ( fig .",
    "[ brill ] ) , but not for @xmath110 . while the dependence on incident energy is relatively weak , fig .",
    "[ v2-au ] , the system - size dependence is rather strong for all centralities , fig .  [ v2-asys ] . as",
    "for directed flow , the system @xmath2ru + @xmath2ru shows a larger difference between @xmath110 and @xmath50 elliptic flow than the system @xmath2zr + @xmath2zr , so the same comments apply . in comparing with the iqmd simulations we find experimentally a somewhat larger elliptic flow , even when using the stiff eos ( fig .",
    "[ flow - v2 ] ) .",
    "the isospin differential flow in the heavy system au+au is again well reproduced ( fig .",
    "[ v2-iso ] ) .    at this time",
    ", however we do not wish to draw firm conclusions on the issue of the stiffness of the eos from the pion flow , as we expect other features of the simulation , namely the treatment of the @xmath86 baryon propagation in the medium , to influence the predicted flow .",
    "shorter effective @xmath86 baryon lifetimes in the model are expected to decrease the efficiency of the assumed dominant pion absorption mechanism via @xmath362 and hence the pion yields at freeze out , as well as the influence of the mean field in the time between elementary collisions , and hence the observed flow .",
    "this is an interesting aspect of in - medium physics in its own right and deserves theoretical investigations with the aim of reaching a consensus on how this problem should be treated properly in transport codes .",
    "much work still needs to be done , to coordinate the transport theoretical efforts with the aim of achieving code independent conclusions .",
    "such efforts were started in ref .",
    "@xcite and continued on a larger scale in ref .",
    "@xcite which also contains further literature citations ( and transport codes ) for the interested reader    the request for reproduction of finer details , such as the full 3d features of the momentum space population under exclusive conditions , subtle system size and isospin effects , is premature at this time as long as global features , such as production , stopping and integrated flow are not under sufficient control .",
    "this is a task for future theoretical work beyond the scope of the present experimental work . from the richness of our observations",
    "it follows that this represents a challenge and hopefully will eventually contribute to a better understanding of nuclear medium properties , which can not simply be inferred from incoherently superimposing experimental information on so - called elementary hadron - hadron reactions .",
