    "the phenomenon of interstellar scattering of pulsar radio signals has been extensively studied for almost 50 years since it was identified @xcite . in our recent studies that were presented in (",
    "* hereafter paper  1 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper  2 ) , we investigated the multi - frequency properties of the scattering phenomenon , following the earlier works of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter l01 and l04 respectively ) .",
    "the special aim of these studies was the estimation of the scatter time frequency scaling index @xmath3 which is one of the crucial scattering parameters that - theoretically - allows us to deduce the turbulent properties of the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "in paper  2 we analysed the multi - frequency scatter time measurements for 60 pulsars , but , at the same time , we noticed a large number of sources for which there were only one or two odd measurements ( in the frequency range from 150  mhz to 1  ghz ) indicating a significant scattering .",
    "while two measurements are too few to reliably estimate the frequency scaling of the pulsar s scattering and to include it in our multi - frequency analysis , we found such sources to be excellent candidates for the next observational project using the giant meterwave radio telescope ( gmrt , located near pune , india ) - an interferometer that can be easily used in the phased array mode allowing for observations in five frequency bands : 150 , 235 , 325 , 610 mhz and 1.0 to 1.4 ghz ( the l - band receiver ) .",
    "multi - frequency observations of the properties of scattered pulsar profiles are crucial to our understanding of the phenomenon . the current scattering theory",
    "( see @xcite for a review ; also see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , l04 , @xcite , @xcite ) assumes that the pulsar profiles are broadened due to the different lengths and travel times of the pulsar rays that are scattered in the ism . as a result ,",
    "the pulsar profiles attain the so called `` scattering tails '' .",
    "the shape of the tail depends on the geometry of scattering . in the simplest case",
    ", we can assume that all of scattering occurs in a thin screen located somewhere between the pulsar and the observer .",
    "if we assume that the distribution of the scattering angles takes a form of a two - dimensional gaussian function , then the observed pulsar profile can be explained as a convolution of the intrinsic pulsar profile with a simple exponential decay function ( often called the pulse broadening function , pbf ) .",
    "the characteristic decay time of this function ( @xmath4 ) is called the scatter time or pulse broadening time .",
    "the actual brightness distribution of the scattering can be estimated using a model of the turbulence in the ism . in a homogeneous and isotropic medium",
    "the spectrum of the spatial electron density can be approximated as @xcite :    @xmath5    where it is assumed that the scale of the fluctuation @xmath6 causing the scattering is neither close to _ inner scale _ nor to _ outer scale _ of the turbulence spectrum , and @xmath7 is the density fluctuation strength .",
    "it was shown that the fluctuation spectral index @xmath8 has to be lower than 4.0 @xcite , and the scatter time will depend on the observing frequency according to a power - law : @xmath9 .",
    "the observed scatter time frequency scaling index @xmath3 can be bound to the spectral index of the fluctuation spectrum by a relation : @xmath10 . for a kolmogorov s spectrum of the density fluctuations ( @xmath11 ) ,",
    "the expected scatter time scaling index is @xmath12 , and the lowest allowable value for the thin screen scattering geometry is @xmath13 , which occurs for the so called critical model ( with @xmath14 )    the pulse broadening spectral slope is the same as the frequency scaling index of the decorrelation bandwidth in the interstellar scintillation theory , since both the scatter time and the decorrelation bandwidth @xmath15are bound by the relation :    @xmath16    in this formula @xmath17 is constant and presumably close to unity , however , this value will slightly differ for different turbulence models and scattering geometries @xcite .",
    "the scatter time measurements and scintillation based measurements can be used to ascertain the value of the scaling index which is especially useful for nearby pulsars , where the scatter time is usually very small ( unless the observations are conducted at very low frequencies ) .",
    "the multi - frequency pulse broadening and/or decorrelation bandwidth analysis was attempted in the past for a limited number of pulsars . @xcite analysed data for 76 sources , however , only for five of them they obtained measurements on three or more frequencies .",
    "similar data were also published by @xcite with another five sources . l01 and l04 collected that data , along with publications by other authors , and added their own pulse broadening measurements to obtain @xmath3 estimates for 27 sources . in paper  1 and paper  2 , we increased this number to 60 , still this data set may be considered small when compared to some other scattering ( and non - multi frequency ) analyses : for example @xcite , who observed 98 pulsars and gathered 371 measurements , or the recent work of @xcite , who measured scatter times for 128 sources , then , for the statistical study , analysed 385 single frequency measurements .",
    "one has to remember , however , that multi - frequency measurements are more useful in scattering studies , since the interpretation of the results does not require invoking the scattering theory ( nor the simplified geometry models ) , as often as it takes place in the case of single frequency studies .",
    "therefore , we believe that increasing the number of objects with multi - frequency pulse broadening measurements will be crucial for our understanding of the scattering phenomenon itself , as well as the properties of the galactic ism causing it - both physical and geometrical . to achieve that , we started an observing campaign using the gmrt at all available observing bands .",
    "in this paper we report the first stage of the project which involved observations of ten pulsars .",
    "we selected ten pulsars which are relatively strong and have shown significant scattering in the 150  to 1000  mhz frequency range in the earlier observations , while at the same time they did not have a satisfactory frequency coverage for pulse broadening measurements - usually just one or two odd measurements , which did not allow for a reliable scatter time frequency scaling analysis .",
    "another important selection criterion was that the pulsar has a relatively simple average profile ( at high observing frequencies where there is no scattering present ) with no apparent asymmetries .",
    "we wanted to avoid multiple - component profiles , and especially the profiles containing two or more components with similar strength and - if that was the case - we needed the components to be widely separated ( i.e. the separation of the components had to be larger than the expected scatter pulse broadening ) .",
    "these criteria were aimed at both : the simplification of the data analysis and increased reliability of our results , as they helped us to alleviate some of the possible sources of the erroneous scatter time measurements ( see the discussion in paper  1 and paper  2 ) .",
    "apart from the pre - selected sample of about 20 sources , we finally decided on observing ten pulsars that are located relatively close in the sky which ensured the most effective use of the telescope time ( see table  [ tau_measurements ] for the list of sources ) .",
    "the observations were conducted between may 09 and may 23 2014 using the giant meterwave radio telescope ( gmrt , pune , india ) in its phased array mode .",
    "we observed in all the frequency bands available , and , depending on the expected amount of scattering , each pulsar was observed at three or four frequencies .",
    "the highest frequency each source was observed at , was chosen in such a way , that it should not exhibit any measurable scatter broadening , and we used the profile shape from this frequency as a reference profile in our analysis .",
    "data collection was made using the gmrt software backend ( gsb , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , using the coherent array mode of about 60% of gmrt antennas",
    "( the core and 2 to 3 antennas in the interferometer `` arms '' ) .",
    "the observations at each frequency were performed as a separate observing session . at the frequencies of 150  mhz and 235 mhz , we collected the data using 16  mhz bandwidth with 256 spectral channels and 112  @xmath18s sampling .",
    "for the 325  mhz , 610  mhz and 1060  mhz , we used 32  mhz bandwidth with 512 spectral channels and 243  @xmath18s sampling .",
    "the typical integration time was 10 minutes , and only a few selected ( weaker ) sources were observed for a maximum of 30 minutes .",
    "data was then dedispersed and folded with the topocentric pulsar period , which was calculated using tempo software , and the pulsar ephemeris from the atnf pulsarcatalogue @xcite . prior to the dedispersion routine",
    ", we also applied a robust procedure to clear the data of strong interference , by removing spectral channels heavily affected by narrow band interference and flagging periods of time affected by unwanted broadband signals .",
    "two sample sets of pulsar profiles we obtained are shown in figure  [ sample_profile ] .",
    "the integration times we used were chosen to assure the signal - to - noise ratio of at least 50 , however , due to a heavy interference present , especially at lower frequencies and possible underestimation of the sky background brightness ( all the pulsars we observed are very close to the galactic plane ) , we were not able to reach this goal .",
    "few of the pulsars were not detected at all in the 150  mhz and 235  mhz data .",
    "this was partially due to the very strong scattering - like in cases of pulsars b1830@xmath008 at 325  mhz or b1913 + 10 at 235  mhz .",
    "in some other cases , the inherently low flux density of the pulsar was an issue , like for psr  j1852@xmath00635 which was in the meantime identified as a gigahertz - peaked spectrum source ( see @xcite , and also @xcite for general information about gps pulsars ) .",
    "nevertheless , we managed to obtain 32 pulse profiles for 10 pulsars ( see figures  [ app_profiles ] in the appendix a ) and successfully measure 26 pulse broadening times , which are presented in table  [ tau_measurements ] ( the remaining six had very little scattering and were used mainly as profile templates ; see the next section ) .",
    "there are at least a few methods of finding the pulse broadening of pulsar signals .",
    "@xcite proposed the cyclic spectral analysis data , which requires access to the raw voltages which were not available in our case . @xcite proposed the `` clean '' method which attempts to de - convolve the intrinsic pulsar profile from the scattering .",
    "we , however , opted for the same method we used in our previous analysis ( see paper  1 and paper  2 and the detailed discussion there ) which involves the fitting of a model ( template ) profile convolved with a pulse broadening function ( pbf ) to the observed profile by adjusting the amount of the pulse broadening . according to @xcite",
    ", the observed pulse profile can be represented by :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the intrinsic profile shape , @xmath21 is the scattering smearing function in the ism , @xmath22 is the ism dispersion smearing function , @xmath23 is the receiving backend response function , and asterisks ( @xmath24 ) denote a convolution . in case of our data , the dispersion smearing and",
    "the backend response functions have only a negligibly small influence on the observed profile .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     table  [ table_alpha ] summarizes the results of our scatter time frequency dependence models , along with the relevant parameters of these pulsars , such as the galactic coordinates , distances and dms ( taken from atnf pulsar catalogue , @xcite ) .",
    "for pulsars with @xmath25 ( within error estimates ) , we also calculated the resulting spatial electron density spectrum index @xmath26 , this relation does not apply , however , in cases where @xmath3 is lower than 4.0 .",
    "the table also shows two additional parameters : the normalized scatter time ( at the observing frequency of 1  ghz ) and the scattering strength parameter @xmath27 . the normalized scatter time was calculated by extrapolating the power - law frequency dependence that we modelled for a given source to a frequency of 1  ghz . using this value , we estimated the corresponding decorrelation bandwidth at this observing frequency ( see equation  [ def_c ] ) , and the scattering strength was estimated by based on @xcite :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the observing frequency in ghz ( in our case @xmath30 ) , @xmath31 is the pulsar distance ( in kpc ) and @xmath32 is the decorrelation bandwidth ( in mhz ) . for the purposes of our calculations",
    ", we used the actual values of @xmath8 in cases where we were able to calculate them , and the kolmogorov s value of @xmath33 otherwise .",
    "the values of the scattering scaling index we obtained range from @xmath34 for psr  b1953 + 50 down to @xmath35 for j1852@xmath00635 .",
    "this last value , however , we consider to be unreliable .",
    "the amount of scattering visible in the profiles of this source ( see figure  [ sample_profile ] ) , even at the lowest frequency we were able to estimate ( i , e , at 325  mhz ) , is relatively small and due to the problems with the profile mentioned above , and rather poor signal - to - noise ratio , this measurement comes with about 30% fractional error . we find it likely that all the measurements at higher frequencies , including the 1.3 ghz measurement reported in paper  2 ( which we show as a triangle in the respective panel in figure  [ plot_tau_vs_freq ] ) can be considered only to represent upper limits for the actual scattering , as we suspect that our fits for the @xmath4 value probably misinterpreted the residual asymmetry of the profile as the scattering . for this pulsar , we can conclude , that finding the real scatter time frequency slope will be extremely hard , as it would require reliable @xmath4 estimates at frequencies below 325  mhz .",
    "this in turn would require a considerable amount of integration time on this gigahertz - peaked spectrum pulsar @xcite ; we attempted to detect this source at both 150  mhz and 235  mhz in 30 minute integrations with no success . for similar reasons we rejected the 1060  mhz measurement for psr  j1835@xmath01020 , however in this case it means that we have measurements at only two frequencies , which does not fulfil our requirement for multi - frequency measurement , and hence we excluded this pulsar from further analysis as well .    disregarding the values of @xmath3 for the two pulsars mentioned above , the value of the lowest pulse broadening frequency slope we found is @xmath36 for psr  b1914 + 13 .",
    "this value is still far from the range allowed by the simple scattering geometries ( @xmath37 ) , however much closer to that range than it was estimated before ( @xmath38 in paper  2 , where it was deemed to be unreliable and was not used in later analysis ) .",
    "still , we believe that the new estimate is solid , and the reason for the deviation may be either in the geometry of scattering or the turbulence spectrum in the scattering screen for this particular case ( see the more detailed discussion in paper  1 ) .",
    "it is also worth mentioning , that similar values are observed for other pulsars as well .",
    "one of such objects is the well studied case of psr  b1933 + 16 ( @xmath39 in paper  2 , see also l04 ) , and coincidently , on the sky , this pulsar is located just a few degrees away from psr  b1914 + 13 .    similarly for psr  b1830@xmath008 in paper  1 we quoted @xmath40 while our current estimate is @xmath41 , i.e. almost equal to the canonical prediction of the thin screen model with kolmogorov s turbulence",
    "this is no surprise , as the earlier estimate was based on just three doubtful high frequency scatter time estimates , and was regarded as unreliable in paper  1 .",
    "the single change in the opposite direction , i.e. away from the theoretically predicted range , is the case of psr  b1929 + 20 , for which in paper  2 we reported @xmath42 while after adding the new estimates the value of @xmath3 is @xmath43 .",
    "we have to point out however that the earlier estimate was based on just three data points , two of which were measurements at very similar frequencies ( 410 and 430 mhz ) , while in our current project we added measurements at 235 , 325 and 610  mhz , where the scattering is large enough to be measurable ( see profiles in the appendix a ) , which makes the new estimate much more reliable .",
    "with the eight new or improved scatter time frequency slope estimates , and corrected @xmath3 uncertainty estimates and their uncertainties can be found in table  [ tab3 ] in appendix b. for all our fits ( we employed the @xmath44 mapping plus monte - carlo simulations method described above to all the @xmath3 estimates from the previous papers ) ] , we decided to revisit the @xmath3 versus dm relation we investigated in paper  1 and paper  2 ( following l01 and l04 ) , and the result is shown in the top panel of figure  [ alpha_dm ] .",
    "the figure now includes the data for 64 sources and the new @xmath3 measurements are denoted as red stars .    the lower panel of figure  [ alpha_dm ] shows the weighted average values of the scatter time frequency scaling index , binned in such a way that each dm bin contains four pulsars .",
    "the horizontal bar represents the dm range over which the value was averaged , while the vertical bar represents the variance of the weighted average .",
    "as one can see the average values vary significantly from bin to bin . for dm s lower than 200  pc  @xmath2",
    "they tend to stay relatively close to the range allowed by the simple scattering geometries , maybe except for the bin around dm=60  pc  @xmath2 which - amongst others - contains the crab pulsar . for larger dms",
    "the average @xmath3 values seem to prefer much lower values ( 5 out of 8 bins in this range ) , however both the large variances of these averages ( and the fact that three bins with large dm show much higher average @xmath3 ) ) confirm a considerable spread of individual values clearly visible in the top panel of the fig .",
    "[ alpha_dm ] . also , one has to remember that while performing this kind of analysis we are averaging the scatter time frequency slopes of different objects , hence we are averaging the properties of scattering along vastly different lines of sight .",
    "these results should not be interpreted literally , for example as a way to predict the value of @xmath3 for any given dm .",
    "nevertheless we find these data in quite a good agreement with findings from l01 and l04 , with a possible slight correction , that even amongst the large - dm pulsars there is a considerable number of objects with values of the scatter time frequency scaling index in the 4.0 to 4.4 range , and that significant deviations from the simple geometry scattering predictions appear even for some of low - dm pulsars .",
    "figure  [ lc2_dist ] shows a plot of the @xmath27 values against the pulsar distance for all the sources with multi - frequency scatter time measurements ( i.e. from paper  2 and the current work ) . as it was the case with the earlier plots of this quantity , which were based on single frequency measurements ( the most recent was shown by @xcite ) , most of the values lie above the canonical prediction for the homogeneous kolmogorov medium ( @xmath45 ,",
    "see @xcite ) .",
    "our data show similar spread and trends as the previous analyses , one has to remember , however , that in the earlier attempts to calculate this value , the authors usually assumed pure kolmogorov s spectrum , putting @xmath33 when using equation  [ eq_c2 ] , while in our analysis we used the real values of @xmath3 and @xmath8 ( where applicable ) .",
    "nevertheless , this did not influence the outcome in any dramatic way , as the change due to using our approach is usually negligibly small when compared with the spread of the data points for any given distance ( which is clearly visible in figure  [ lc2_dist ] ) .",
    "we also plotted the value of @xmath27 in the galactic sky coordinates ( figure  [ lc2_lb ] ) and in the galaxtic x - y coordinates ( figure  [ lc2_xy ] ) . in these plots",
    "the size of the circle represents the magnitude of the fluctuation strength parameter , and the color indicates the value of the scatter time scaling index @xmath3 : blue for @xmath46 , black for @xmath47 , and red for @xmath48 .",
    "it is not surprising that the red circles dominate these plots ( since the average value of @xmath3 is just under 4.0 ) , and , similarly to what we have shown in paper  1 and paper  2 , there does not seem to be any correlation between the value of the scatter time scaling index and the position of the pulsar in the galaxy . when it comes to the fluctuation strength @xmath27 obviously the larger values are preferred for distant pulsars , and the extremely large values can be seen only for sources that are apparently behind the carina - sagittarius spiral arm , and in ( or behind ) the crux - scutum arm .",
    "one has to remember , however that the galactic x - y coordinates plot should not be over - interpreted , as one of the crucial parameters used to create it - the pulsar distance - may be very inaccurate , as it is usually inferred from the dispersion measure .",
    "one puzzling feature of figure  [ lc2_lb ] ( bottom plot ) may be the clustering of large red circles on the galactic plane near the galactic longitude of @xmath49 .",
    "the number of measurements in this region may be easily explained : this region is still close to the galactic centre , which makes it densely populated by known pulsars . in the equatorial coordinates these pulsars lie in r.a . range between 18@xmath50 and @xmath51 and close enough to the celestial equator to make them easier to observe for the northern hemisphere radio telescopes , which explains the large number of multi - frequency pulse broadening measurements .",
    "this can not explain why all of the corresponding circles are red - i.e. why there are no sources in this direction showing @xmath52 .",
    "one has to remember , however , that all of the @xmath3 estimates used to create this plot have some uncertainties and at least for some of them there is a chance that the actual scaling index is greater than 4.0 , which would make this galactic line - of - sight no different from the others .",
    "hence , we believe that this feature may be just a simple coincidence .    figure  [ bhat ] shows the plot of the amount of standardized scattering ( @xmath4 at the frequency of 1  ghz ) versus the dispersion measure for all the pulsars with multi - frequency scatter time measurements . following paper  2 , for pulsars with the scintillation based estimates of @xmath4",
    ", we used @xmath53 to recalculate the decorrelation bandwidth measurements to pulse broadening times .",
    "the new and/or updated values obtained in the current analysis - represented by the red stars - seem to very well follow the relation(s ) we adopted in paper  2 ( the solid blue lines ) .",
    "in this paper we presented multi - frequency pulse broadening measurements for ten radio pulsars . for eight of them",
    "we were able - in connection with the previously published data - to obtain new estimates of the scatter time frequency scaling , which turned out to be a vast improvement over the earlier estimates for these sources . using the new observational data in conjunction with the results published in paper  2",
    ", we investigated the dependence of the scattering parameters with the pulsar distance ( and dispersion measure ) and any possible correlations of these parameters with the pulsar s position in the galaxy - for a total of 64 objects with multi - frequency scatter time measurements .",
    "this may be considered a small number compared to some other analyses - like the recent study of @xcite which involved single frequency measurements for 385 pulsars . yet , having multi - frequency information and the resulting frequency scaling index in our analysis , definitely helps to alleviate problems and biases with the scattering parameters - especially when it comes to re - scaling of these to some standard frequency ( like the @xmath4 at 1  ghz ) , or removing the frequency dependence altogether ( like for @xmath27 ) . in case of our data set ,",
    "we are able to use the frequency scaling that comes from the observational data of a given source , instead of using the theoretical predictions and/or values averaged for the whole population - as it was done in the past by @xcite , @xcite and others .",
    "the average weigted value of the scatter time frequency scaling index is @xmath54 , where the uncertainty is @xmath55 standard deviation of the entire sample , hence it describes the spread of the individual measurements rather than the accuracy of the average . in the earlier studies of @xmath3 versus dm dependence l01 and l04 suggested that for pulsars with dm@xmath1300  pc  @xmath2 the value of the scaling index @xmath3 is significantly lower than for the low - dm pulsars .",
    "the extension of the scaling indices data base we presented in paper  2 ( which we improved further in this work ) allows us to modify this conclusion slightly .",
    "firstly , deviations from the theory predicted range appear for selected pulsars of all dm ranges .",
    "secondly , l04 claimed that the average scatter time frequency slope for pulsars with dm@xmath1300  pc  @xmath2 is much lower than predicted by simple geometry scattering theories , i.e. they obtained @xmath56 in this dm range . using our database we are able to obtain such a low ( weighted ) average value only for the pulsars with dm@xmath1650  pc  @xmath2 ( @xmath57 ) . at the same time",
    "the weighted average value for objects with dm@xmath1200  pc  @xmath2 in our data is @xmath58 , much lower than for low dm pulsars ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "the small discrepancy between our interpretation and the one given by l04 is clearly a result of the differences between the two datasets .",
    "our database contains much more low - dm pulsars with low @xmath3 values , and amongst high ( or very high ) dm pulsars we found significantly more objects with the values of @xmath3 in the range predicted by simple geometry scattering theory .",
    "the deviations in the values of @xmath3 are expected for some of the individual sources , as we widely discuss in paper  1 .",
    "they are likely due to some unusual scattering geometries ( for example in the case of multiple scattering screens or truncated screens , see @xcite ) .",
    "it should be no surprise that such occurrences are less likely for nearby and mid - distance pulsars ( hence they do not affect the average value by much ) , but it would be worth investigating , if they are indeed very common for distant objects , and not just the handful of pulsars we were able to study so far .",
    "our current sample includes only three sources in the dm@xmath1700  pc  @xmath2 range , and five pulsars in the 500 to 700  pc  @xmath2 .",
    "this statistics clearly asks for an improvement , which would require an observational effort .",
    "new pulse broadening measurements would be extremely useful at frequencies between 1 and 2 ghz , where the scattering for high dm pulsars should be large enough to make pulse broadening measurements reliable .",
    "so far we have only one source in this range with exceptionally good coverage - psr  b1758@xmath023 with estimates at nine frequencies between 1.0 and 2.3  ghz ( see paper  2 ) .    clearly",
    ", our results also support the notion that for individual sources the scattering is highly line - of - sight dependant .",
    "with this , the understanding of the character of scattering medium in our galaxy , both in terms of its geometry , as well as its physical ( turbulent ) properties , will require further investigation and better statistics than 64 lines - of - sight that currently have been studied .",
    "hence the need for further scattering measurements , both for nearby sources - where the new telescope projects such as lofar , mwa or lwa may be very helpful - as well as for the distant objects ( with very large dm s ) , for which measurements with good frequency coverage around 1  ghz would be extremely useful .",
