    "the last 50 years have been one of the most fruitful ones in the life of physics , the standard model of particles and the standard model of cosmology ( smc ) essentially developed in this period , are now able to explain a great number of observations in laboratories and cosmological observatories as never before . in only 50 years",
    "great steps have been given in the understanding of the origin and development of the universe .",
    "nevertheless , many questions are still open , for example the smc contains two periods , inflation and structure formation . for the understanding of the structure formation epoch we need to postulate the existence of two kind of substances , the dark matter and the dark energy . without them , it is impossible to explain the formation of galaxies and cluster of galaxies , or the observed accelerated expansion of the universe . on the other side",
    ", it has been postulated a period of inflation in order to give an explanation for several observations as the homogeneity of the universe , the close value of the density of the universe to the critical density or the formation of the seeds which formed the galaxies .",
    "however , there is not a theory that unify this two periods , essentially they are disconnected from each other .    in this work",
    "we study the possibility that superstring theory could account for the unification between inflation and the structure formation using a specific example .",
    "recently , frey and mazumdar @xcite , were able to compactify the iib superstrings including 32 fluxes . in the context of the type iib supergravity theory on the @xmath0 orientifold with a self - dual three - form fluxes",
    ", it has been shown that after compactifaying the effective dilaton - axion potential is given by @xcite @xmath1 ,    \\label{eq : poteff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath3 are the ns - ns integral fluxes , the superscript @xmath4 in the fields stands for the fields in the vacuum configuration and finally @xmath5 with @xmath6 are the overall size of each factor @xmath7 of the @xmath8 orientifold .",
    "this potential contains two main scalar fields ( moduli fields ) , the dilaton @xmath9 and the axion @xmath10 . in @xcite ,",
    "the dilaton was interpreted as dark matter and under certain conditions the model reproduces the observed universe , @xmath11 , the structure formation . in this work",
    "we investigate if the same theory could give an inflationary period in order to obtain a unified picture between these two epochs .",
    "in other words , in this paper we search if it is possible that the same low energy lagrangian of iib superstrings with the scalar and axion potential ( [ eq : poteff ] ) can give an acceptable inflationary period . to deal with the fluxes , we work in the brane representation of space - time , working with a rs - ii modification in the equations .",
    "due to the presence of the fluxes during this period , these models have the phenomenology of the randall - sundum models @xcite,@xcite,@xcite and we have chosen to work with the rs - ii one , but the same type of analysis could be done for the other model . the paper is organized as follows . in section [ section : potential ]",
    "we introduce an appropriate parametrization of potential ( [ eq : poteff ] ) in order to give unities to the physical quantities and to study the cosmology of the low energy lagrangian and give the field equation to be solved . in section",
    "[ section : phenomenology ] we solve the equations in the different regimes and conditions . in section [ num ] we give the main results and in section [ section : conclusions ] we discuss some conclusions and perspectives .",
    "in order to study the cosmology of this model , it is convenient to define the following quantities @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the string coupling @xmath14 , and @xmath15 with @xmath16 the reduced planck mass . with this new variables ,",
    "the dilaton potential transforms into @xmath17 where @xmath18 is interpreted as the cosmological constant , which we will take as subdominant during the inflationary period . in what follows",
    "we want to study the behaviour of this potential at early times when the scalar field @xmath19 takes large values and study the conditions that the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath20 need to meet in order to have inflation . thus expressing the @xmath21 function in terms of exponentials and taking the limit @xmath19 big",
    ", we arrive to the following expression for the potential : @xmath22 where we have taken into account that the cosmological constant is much smaller than the coefficient of the potential , @xmath23 , nevertheless , it remains a term @xmath20 acting during the inflationary period like an extra  cosmological constant \" and that we will address as a free parameter of the model .",
    "in contrast with the usual hybrid inflation scenario @xcite , there is no critical value for which this potential exhibits a phase transition triggering the end of inflation ( if any such process occurs ) .",
    "the potential follows an exponential behaviour in the @xmath19 field that prevents it from staying at a fixed value from the start , i.e. it can not relax at @xmath24 or at any other different value ( apart from infinity ) .",
    "a plot of the potential illustrates this behaviour , see fig .",
    "[ plotpot ] .",
    "we have checked that there are no saddle points for this potential eq .",
    "( [ pinf ] ) and also for potentials ( [ eq : poteff ] ) and ( [ pdil ] ) , but a global minimum at @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , we will assume that there is some mechanism by which the @xmath26 field rolls down to its minimum at @xmath25 oscillating around it at the very early stages of evolution and that any processes such as inflation took place afterwards .",
    "in this way , any information concerning the evolution of @xmath26 is erased by the expansion led by the @xmath19 field if inflation is to happen .",
    "thus we can work with the following expression for the potential : @xmath27 we will follow closely the analysis done by copeland _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and mendes and liddle @xcite in order to obtain the conditions for this potential to undergo inflation in the cases when the scalar field or the @xmath20 term dominate the dynamics as well as in the intermediate stage .",
    "our calculations are performed in the high - energy regime within the slow - roll approximation since a potential slow - roll formalism has already been provided for this scenario @xcite .      in the presence of branes , particularly in the rs - ii scenario ,",
    "the friedmann equation changes from its usual expression to @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the scale factor of the universe , a dot means derivative with respect to time and @xmath31 is the brane tension .",
    "the total density @xmath32 as well as the equations of motion for the fields in the standard cosmology case are deduced in @xcite : @xmath33 in our case , @xmath34 which in the slow - roll approximation can be written as @xmath35 \\label{fesra}\\ ] ]    the equations of motion for both fields are given considering only the presence of both scalar fields with no radiation fluid , they are @xcite @xmath36 which in the slow - roll approximation are @xmath37 since the right - hand side of the second equation in ( [ ef ] ) can be taken as a kinetic term to the square .",
    "there is an important consequence in the fact that we are considering the @xmath26 field in the value corresponding to the minimum of its potential at @xmath25 .",
    "this leads to a system of equations that do not have source terms and couplings of the fields and we end up with the same system as for the usual rs - ii modification .",
    "otherwise , in order to do a proper inflationary analysis , we would have to define new expressions for the potential slow - roll parameters considering not only the modification due to the rs - ii term , but also to the couplings between the @xmath26-potential and the @xmath19 in the friedmann equation ( [ fesra ] ) and the source term in the first of equations ( [ efsra ] ) .",
    "this procedure simplifies considerably the equations but avoids having a realistic analysis of the evolution of both fields including source terms and couplings , something that clearly must have an impact on the conditions to have inflation .",
    "although a full analysis is undoubtedly required , we address the problem with these simplifications as a first insight before more general assumptions are considered .",
    "the analysis that follows will be confined to the high - energy limit of this model , which simplifies calculations further .",
    "consenquently , we have the following system of equations within the slow - roll approximation and the high - energy limit : @xmath38 which can be solved analitically . in this work",
    "we take the convention @xmath39 , hence the @xmath19 field is a decreasing function of time .",
    "the solutions of the field equations will be given in section [ sfe ] .",
    "the expressions for the potential slow - roll parameters for the rs - ii cosmology having the inflaton field confined to the brane were deduced by maartens _",
    "_ @xcite . for the high - energy limit",
    "they are : @xmath40 where primes indicate derivatives with respect to the @xmath19 field .",
    "the slow - roll approximation is satisfied as long as the slow - roll parameters defined previously accomplish the following conditions : @xmath41 the number of e - foldings of inflation in terms of the potential for this model is given in our notation by @xcite : @xmath42 where @xmath43 represents the value of @xmath19 n e - foldings of expansion before the end of inflation and @xmath44 is the value of the field at the end of inflation .",
    "for the potential ( [ pphi ] ) we have @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 . \\label{cn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the only way by which inflation can be ended in our model is by violation of the slow - roll approximation with @xmath48 exceeding unity .",
    "the value of @xmath19 at which @xmath48 becomes equal to unity is @xmath49 \\left[\\frac{4^{1/3}b^{1/3}}{2\\lambda^2\\rho_0 } \\right.\\right .",

    "( [ pphi ] ) and we will have an exponential potential , which in the standard cosmology case corresponds to power - law inflation , but not for the rs - ii modification .    the bound found before depends on the choice of values for @xmath13 and @xmath20 . as we shall see in section [ fdr ] , @xmath13 is fixed once the value of the brane tension is given",
    ". so actually eq .",
    "( [ con ] ) depends only on the choice of @xmath20 .",
    "we use the computing packages mathematica and maple to find numerically the values of @xmath20 ensuring the l.h.s .",
    "this happens if : @xmath53 although both intervales guarantee a real value in the roots of condition ( [ con ] ) , this is not equivalent to have this condition satisfied in order to have a field dominated region as we shall see later . from these expressions ,",
    "the second case satisfies having a brane tension with no incompatibilities with nucleosynthesis @xcite,@xcite , and we will restrict further calculations to this posibility only .",
    "the field responsible for inflation produces perturbations which can be of three types : scalar , vector and tensor .",
    "vector perturbations decay in an expanding universe and tensor perturbations do not lead to gravitational instabilities producing structure formation .",
    "the adiabatic scalar or density perturbations can produce these type of instabilities through the vacuum fluctuations of the field driving the inflationary expansion .",
    "so they are usually thought to be the seeds of the large scale structures of the universe @xcite .",
    "one of the quantities that determines the spectrum of the density perturbations is @xmath54 which gives the density contrast at horizon crossing ( if evaluated at that scale ) . for the rs - ii modification and in our notation , this quantity is @xcite,@xcite @xmath55 evaluated at the scale @xmath56 .",
    "the slow - roll approximation guarantees that @xmath54 is nearly independent of scale when scales of cosmological interest are crossing the horizon , satisfying the new cobe constrain updated to wmap3 @xcite as @xmath57 @xcite . here",
    "we take @xmath58 e - foldings before the end of inflation to find the scales of cosmological interest .",
    "we use equation ( [ cn]),provided we know the value of @xmath44 given by equation ( [ phiec ] ) , to find the value @xmath43 corresponding to @xmath59 , that is 60 e - foldings before the end of inflation and evaluate @xmath54 as @xmath60    the results are given in table [ t2 ] of section [ num ]      considering the case when the @xmath26 field plays no role and @xmath19 governs the dynamics of the expansion alone , from eq .",
    "( [ pphi ] ) , we have a potential of exponential type resembling that of power - law inflation in the standard cosmology@xcite .",
    "the first term of eq .",
    "( [ pphi ] ) dominates giving an exponential expansion but not to power - law because the dynamics of rs - ii changes this condition .",
    "the slow - roll parameters are given by : @xmath61 in contrast with the standard cosmology where they are not only the same but constant .",
    "the fact that the dynamics is modified due to the randall - sundrum cosmology , allows the existence of a value of @xmath19 that finishes inflation , since as we just saw , the parameters show a dependence on @xmath19 and therefore , an evolution .",
    "we have that in this regime , the value of @xmath44 corresponding to the end of inflation is given by @xmath62 .",
    "the @xmath63 is used because we are in the potential slow - roll approximation not the hubble one @xcite .",

    "( [ con ] ) , we get in principle a set of values for the constant @xmath20 that satisfy the field domination condition .",
    "we consider now the regime in which the second term of eq .",
    "( [ pphi ] ) dominates the dynamics . in this case",
    "the slow -roll parameters eqns .",
    "( [ srp ] ) are : @xmath68 @xmath69 we find ourselves here with the fact that @xmath48 is negative , that is , with a period of deflation @xcite .",
    "such behviour has already been predicted for these models before @xcite .",
    "it is necessary to point out that this is a consequence of the modification of the dynamics .",
    "the definition of @xmath48 for the randall  sundrum ii cosmology in the high - energy limit is not positive definite as in the standard cosmology case .",
    "thus a stage of accelerated contraction for this regime on the potential is only a result of the modification in the field equations .    following the evolution of the dynamics with the potential eq .",
    "( [ pphi ] ) , from a region where @xmath19 dominates , to a stage in which the energy @xmath20 drives the behaviour of the expansion , we observe a primordial inflationary expansion that erases all information concerning any process that the @xmath26 field might have undergone under the influence of the potential eq .",
    "( [ pinf ] ) . the intermediate regime , in which both terms in eq .  ( [ pphi ] )",
    "are of the same order , produces further expansion .",
    "finally the field @xmath19 reaches a value on the potential that comences a stage of accelerated contraction .",
    "this value is obtained when the denominator in eq .",
    "( [ cep ] ) changes sign : @xmath70 corresponding to the value of the vacuum - dominated regime .",
    "such process takes place when the field @xmath19 takes values below @xmath71 .",
    "( [ phic ] ) is equivalent to @xmath72 .",
    "thus the balance of the terms in eq .",
    "( [ pphi ] ) and the sign of @xmath20 determine the place where deflation starts as the point where the potential crosses the @xmath19 axis .    in principle",
    ", there would not be a physical reason that could prevent this deflationary stage to stop .",
    "but the argument mentioned before , concerning the modification of the dynamics applies again .",
    "we observe @xmath48 has a dependence on the field and therefore undergoes an evolution accordingly .",
    "the condition to end deflation is @xmath73 , in oposition to inflation . in consequence",
    ", we can also find from the first of equations ( [ epsv0 ] ) a value of @xmath19 corresponding to this ; @xmath74 where this time , the subscript `` e '' , indicates the end of deflation .",
    "this value , as we can see , depends on @xmath20 and @xmath13 .",
    "the choice of @xmath20 parameter will be given in section [ num ] where we give different values acording to the conditions we find in the following .",
    "we shall see whether or not an inflationary stage takes place under the value of @xmath13 found in the previous analysis .",
    "the intermediate regime corresponds to the region where both terms in eq  ( [ pphi ] ) are of the same order . in order to obtain a bound on the values of @xmath20 that satisfy",
    "the cobe constrain ( [ dcc ] ) , we need to solve numerically eqs .",
    "( [ cn ] ) and ( [ phiec]).since we have that both terms in eq .",
    "( [ pphi ] ) are important , this means that the exponential is of @xmath75 , thus we can expand it in taylor series as @xmath76 and arrive to a value of @xmath44 equal to @xmath77 where @xmath78 now is given by @xmath79    in order to have a real scalar field , we find two bounds for the values that @xmath20 can take on following from the roots in the previous expressions : @xmath80 the first bound coincides with the value given by eq  ( [ c2 ] ) needed to have real values in condition ( [ con ] ) .",
    "it is an upper bound for the allowed values of @xmath20 in expression ( [ phiec ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", we have from eqns .",
    "( [ phiec ] ) and ( [ b ] ) that positive values of @xmath20 also satisfy that there exists a real value of @xmath44 in the intermediate regime .",
    "but @xmath20 can not be 0 otherwise many of the equations we have been looking at would be undefined .",
    "so we have an interval of allowed values of @xmath20 as : @xmath81 if @xmath82 , eq .",
    "( [ epsv0 ] ) is negative and we have the period of deflation mentioned before . but @xmath83 means that even in the region of vacuum domination @xmath48 can be positive and we return to the usual picture of inflation .",
    "however , having chosen a value of @xmath20 below this bound , eqns .",
    "( [ cep ] ) and ( [ srpp ] ) become negative , thus giving a period of deflation translated to the epochs of field domination and the intermediate regime .",
    "we can then choose values for @xmath20 below @xmath84 being in a period of deflation for the first two regimes ending with a stage of inflation for the @xmath20 dominated region .",
    "( [ b ] ) and ( [ phiec ] ) still have real values because the approximation made in this section to find the upper limits of @xmath20 , is a lower bound on eqns .",
    "( [ phiec ] ) and ( [ b ] ) .",
    "this is in fact redundant since we have also said that both terms in the potential ( [ pphi ] ) are of the same order , so the expansion is valid for the general case .",
    "once the choice of @xmath20 is done , we can solve numerically to find a value for @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ cn ] ) , then it is introduced into eq .",
    "( [ dp ] ) and can be accepted or rejected depending on whether or not it fullfils the left - hand side .",
    "this value depends on @xmath31 , the brane tension , and we present the results for different values of it considering that in order to have no incompatibilities with nucleosynthesis the brane tension must satisfy @xmath85 @xcite , the authors take the number @xmath86 , the difference arises due to the change of notation .",
    "we also check that the choice on @xmath31 satisfies the cobe constrain .",
    "the results are shown in table [ t2 ] .      following the argument in the preceeding paragraph",
    ", it would be possible to continue with the usual analysis to find the value of @xmath19 that finishes inflation , in the vacuum - dominated region provided @xmath20 is negative and calculate the number of e - foldings and the use eq .",
    "( [ dp ] ) in the region of vacuum domination to find a constrain on @xmath20 .",
    "we find from equation ( [ epsv0 ] ) that @xmath87 and from eq  ( [ n ] ) that @xmath88 . \\label{p60v0}\\ ] ] and finally from ( [ dp ] ) : @xmath89    this equation can be solved numerically to give a value of @xmath20 that is in accordance with the cobe constrain for the perturbations . as we shall see later , this process will not be applied to the case of vacuum domination , since we find @xmath48 to be a decreasing function of time , therefore for this case inflation never ends .",
    "therefore it is not possible to find a value of the parameter @xmath20 satisfying this condition in the case of vacuum domination hence the values of @xmath20 coresponding to this regime are ruled out by observations .",
    "so in fact , the value of @xmath48 corresponding to 1 indicates in this case the place where inflation starts to take place as from there onwards we will have that @xmath90      in this subsection we solve the system of field equations .",
    "the numeric results are presented in the next section . integrating eqns.([srhefe ] ) for the potential ( [ pphi ] ) yields : @xmath91 \\label{sft}\\ ] ] and @xmath92 one can immediately see that the behaviour of the field does not depend on the value of the parameter @xmath20 , but only on @xmath13 whose value is given by eq .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) . from this solution and its plot",
    ", one can check that indeed the field is a decreasing function of time , having the same bahaviour regardless of the regime it is in .",
    "the scale factor shows little dependance on the value of @xmath20 as shown in the plots . following an increasing behaviour for @xmath82 .",
    "figures [ sae - v0pos1 ] , [ sae - v0pos2 ] , [ sae - v0pos3 ] show that for @xmath82 , @xmath48 is a growing positive function which corresponds to an inflationary stage as expected from the analysis of the previous sections .",
    "the acceleration factor is also shown , and one can observe that for the range used in the plots @xmath93 changes sign before @xmath48 reaches 1 in the same interval .",
    "we have plotted for completeness the scale and acceleration factors as well as @xmath48 in fig.[sae - v0neg ] for a negative value of @xmath20 .",
    "the scale and acceleration factors change the sign of their slope at @xmath94 which is the same value as that from eq .",
    "( [ phic ] ) indicating the start of the vacuum - dominated regime .",
    "so one ends with a stage of inflation after deflation in the other two regimes .",
    "we find that @xmath48 is a positive decreasing function of time according with what was found .",
    "this means that although there is a period of inflation , after deflation , it will never end and there is no meaning in calculating the value of the potential from eq .",
    "( [ v0v0 ] ) satisfying the cobe constrain since there is no value of the field corresponding to 60 e - folds before the end of inflation .",
    "the case of vacuum domination with a negative potential is not realistic for this model with our approximations .",
    "the bounds that the field needs to meet in order to have inflation for the intermediate regime are presented in table [ t4 ] .",
    "the value of the parameter @xmath20 in the region of vacuum domination remains unsconstrained , therefore it is not possible to give a bound on the value of the field for the beginning of inflation .",
    "before starting with the numeric results for the three regions just analized , we summarize what we have found so far .",
    "they are shown schematically in table [ t1 ] .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ t4 ]",
    "in this work we have seen the conditions that the parameters of potential ( [ pphi ] ) have to fulfill in order to have early universe inflation , using the same scalar field potential as in @xcite in order to have a unified picture between inflation and structure formation .",
    "we find that the value of the parameter @xmath13 can be fixed in the region of field domination and that there can be two possibilities for the sign of the parameter @xmath20 .",
    "each of them determine different dynamics in the evolution of the field equations .",
    "a positive sign leads to a period of inflation followed by one of deflation , whereas the opposite sign implies the contrary . in the first case ,",
    "the values of @xmath20 we have found as viable to meet the cobe constrain , are not in agreement with those found in @xcite by several orders of magnitude .",
    "this behaviour seems to be generic in superstrings theory , implying that if we would like to relate the moduli fields with the inflaton , dark energy or dark matter , the model could fit observations either during the inflationary epoch or during the structure formation , but the challenge is to derive a model which fit our observing universe during the whole history of the universe .",
    "otherwise , superstring theory have to give alternative candidates for these fields and explain why we do not see the moduli fields in our observations .",
    "two important points to notice are that the analysis employed in this work has been made with the assumption that the field @xmath26 or axion does not play a significant role in the dynamics and the slow - roll approximation has simplified the equations further .",
    "this behaviour is observed in the analysis carry out in @xcite , where it is shown that the axion field could remain as a subdominant field .",
    "nevertheless , even when this behaviour remains so until redshifts beyond @xmath95 , the axion could have a different behaviour beyond this redshifts .",
    "this is indeed a very strong assumption which is not well justified completely , but our work is a first approximation to solve the problem and we are aware that a more general analysis including the axion field needs to be done .",
    "the second case corresponding to vacuum domination has proved unrealistic to have a viable model of inflation since this process does not end and we do not have other mechanism to finish it as in the usual hybrid inflation scenario .",
    "it would follow from this that a more general analysis is needed in order to determine whether the consequences of our assumptions are important or not .",

    "<S> we study the conditions needed to have an early epoch of inflationary expansion with a potential coming from iib superstring theory with fluxes involving two moduli fields . </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenology of this potential is different from the usual hybrid inflation scenario and we analyze the possibility that the system of field equations undergo a period of inflation in three different regimes with the dynamics modified by a randall - sundrum ii term in the friedmann equation . we find that the system can produce inflation and due to the modification of the dynamics , a period of accelerated contraction can follow or preceed this inflationary stage depending on the sign of one of the parameters of the potential . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss on the viability of this model in a cosmological context . </S>"
