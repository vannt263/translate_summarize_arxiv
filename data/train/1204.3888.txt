    "in the absence of punishment cooperators survive only if @xmath8 , and crowd out defectors completely for @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "these can be used as benchmark values for evaluating the impact of pool - punishment on the evolution of cooperation in structured populations .",
    "focusing first on the @xmath10 parameter plane , we present in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] full phase diagrams and the corresponding dependence of the punishment pool balance @xmath5 for two different values of @xmath11 .",
    "panels ( a ) and ( b ) feature results for @xmath12 , implying that second - order free - riders are punished equally strong as defectors .",
    "this is a common assumption , although the offence committed by cooperators , who contribute to the public good but abstain from punishing , is actually smaller than the one committed by defectors , who free - ride on both occasions .",
    "it can be observed that below a critical fine @xmath13 punishers can not survive , and accordingly , the spatial grid is dominated by defectors or a mixed c+d phase , depending on the value of @xmath14 . since",
    "cooperators and defectors are punished equally , the absence of punishers transforms the public goods game into its traditional two - strategy variant where the value of @xmath4 merely rescales the payoffs but does not influence the outcome . in this sense",
    ", it could be assumed that punishment is not executed at all if punishers die out without this affecting the presented results .",
    "accordingly , @xmath15 @xcite is recovered as the critical synergy factor above which cooperators can survive . for @xmath16 , however , cooperators are subverted by punishers via a discontinuous phase transition . with their emergence",
    ", collaborative efforts can be sustained also for @xmath17 , whereby the larger the fine the smaller the synergy factor needed to achieve this .",
    "pertaining variations in sustainability , evaluated by means of the punishment pool balance @xmath5 , are depicted in panel ( b ) .",
    "the elimination of second - order free - riders is clearly a necessary condition that needs to be fulfilled for pool - punishment to be sustainable .",
    "in addition , however , the fraction of defectors in the p+d phase needs to be sufficiently small .",
    "the region of full sustainability , where @xmath18 , is delineated with a dash - dotted gray line , while conditional sustainability characterizes the remainder of the p+d phase .",
    "there the high fraction of defectors in the p+d phase precludes positive values of @xmath5 .        complying with the proposition that cooperators should be punished more leniently than defectors , we set @xmath11 to @xmath19 , which implies that the fine for second - order free - riding is half the one for defecting .",
    "results presented in panels ( c ) and ( d ) of fig",
    ".  [ fig1 ] qualitatively agree with those presented for @xmath12 in panels ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "a distinctive feature is that the critical fine at which the discontinuous phase transition @xmath20 occurs is now two times larger , i.e. , @xmath21 .",
    "borders of conditional and full sustainability move towards larger @xmath4 accordingly .",
    "it is important to note that in the absence of cooperators @xmath11 has no effect on the evolution of the remaining two strategies .",
    "for @xmath22 the results in panels ( c ) and ( d ) are therefore identical to those presented in panels ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "conversely , for @xmath23 , where punishers can not survive , the competition between cooperators and defectors is no longer unaffected by @xmath4 as was this the case for @xmath12 . since here",
    "defectors are punished with the full fine while cooperators with only half of it , larger values of @xmath4 decrease the critical synergy factor @xmath14 that is needed for cooperative behavior to remain in existence .",
    "since the discontinuous phase transition @xmath20 is crucial for the sustainability of pool - punishment , we proceed by examining the evolutionary process at both sides of it in detail .",
    "panels ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] depict characteristic snapshots of the spatial grid that eventually lead to a stable c+d phase , while panels ( e ) , ( f ) and ( g ) depict snapshots leading to a stable p+d phase .",
    "although the final outcome in this two cases is remarkably different , the difference in the fine @xmath4 that is needed for this to happen is minute , which is a characteristic feature of a discontinuous phase transition .",
    "results in panels ( d ) and ( h ) illustrate this phenomenon in terms of the densities of punishers @xmath24 ( solid green ) and cooperators ( dashed blue ) @xmath25 over time .",
    "what promises to be an identical evolutionary process at @xmath26 full monte carlo ( mc ) iteration steps [ compare ( a ) and ( e ) ] , _ slowly _ diverges [ see ( d ) and ( h ) ] towards two very different but stable results . at @xmath27",
    "full mc steps the snapshots already hint decisively in favor of either the cooperators ( b ) or the punishers ( f ) , depending on the value of @xmath4 . at @xmath28",
    "full mc steps the stationary state in both cases is reached , where the full magnitude of the difference is revealed . for @xmath29 ( c ) the",
    "cooperators completely subvert punishers to form a stable coexistence phase with defectors ( red ) , while for @xmath30 ( g ) the punishers prevail and eliminate the second - order free - riders completely .",
    "panel ( i ) illustrates the workings of the discontinuous phase transition in terms of the punishment pool balance @xmath5 , which , after a substantial period of equivalence , turns unsustainable for @xmath29 ( dashed orange ) and sustainable for @xmath30 ( solid yellow ) .",
    "different outcomes of the proposed spatial public goods game with pool - punishment can be understood better still if considering @xmath11 and @xmath4 as the two variable parameters by a given value of @xmath14 .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] features the full @xmath31 phase diagram ( a ) and the corresponding color encoded stationary fraction of defectors @xmath32 ( b ) for @xmath33 .",
    "the phase diagram has a markedly webbed structure , indicating the possibility of stable pure p , c and d phases , as well as stable mixed p+d and c+d phases .",
    "all but the @xmath20 phase transition are continuous , as indicated by the black solid lines . the discontinuous phase transition is depicted dashed gray , whereby the line corresponds exactly to @xmath34 , which can be obtained by equating @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( see methods ) .",
    "thus , it implies equivalence of punishers and cooperators . above the line punishers",
    "should outperform cooperators , while below the line cooperators should prevail . due to the locally independent introduction of pool - punishment",
    ", this well - mixed approximation is accurately reproduced by the numerical simulations of the spatially structured model .",
    "panel ( b ) features the pertaining regions of conditional ( dashed gray ) and full ( dash - dotted gray ) sustainability . for sufficiently large ( small ) values of @xmath4 ( @xmath11 )",
    "the @xmath34 dependence agrees perfectly with the emergence of full sustainability , and thus confirms that the elimination of second - order free - riders is a necessary condition for institutionalized punishment to be sustainable . before reaching the @xmath37 phase transition line from above ,",
    "the pool - punishment becomes conditionally sustainable only ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) , whereby the discontinuous phase transition on the left still remains an accurate delineator of this region .",
    "the color encoded values of @xmath32 in ( b ) illustrate that under appropriate conditions up to half of the lattice my be occupied by defectors and still @xmath5 remains positive .",
    "this is in stark contrast with the fact that even a minute fraction of cooperators precludes the possibility of sustainable institutionalized punishment , and leads to the conclusion that not the defectors but rather the second - order free - riders are the ones most prohibitive for its success .",
    "over - fishing , environmental pollution , depletion of natural resources , or the misuse of social security systems , are prime examples of the exploitation of public goods .",
    "we as humans , although being notoriously famous for cooperative behavior , are also likewise famous for exceeding resources that are readily available to us , despite the fact that later generations may pay for our misbehavior greatly .",
    "identifying what works most efficiently in leading us away from antisocial behavior is therefore of the outmost importance .",
    "punishment , either peer or pool based , is weaved in our history records as something that can foster collaborative efforts and keeps our egos in check . however , in the light of pro - social behavior , punishment can be regarded as just another public good that needs our selfless side to shine through .",
    "how and why punishment emerges and can be stabilized appears therefore to be a translation of above - mentioned problems into a single one , which if effectively solved , will solve also all the other ones . yet",
    "it is a fruitful and gratifying approach allowing us to capture the essence of the problem and investigate , primarily by means of minimalist but relevant models , the how s and why s of the evolution of cooperation and social norms @xcite .",
    "here we have demonstrated that such a model can explain the emergence and stability of institutionalized punishment .",
    "in particular , we have shown that the elimination of second - order free - riders through spatially structured interactions paves the way for sustainable pool - punishment if accompanied by sufficiently large fines and synergetic effects of cooperation .",
    "second - order free - riders are thereby eliminated by means of a discontinuous phase transition that shifts the evolution rather explosively in favor of the punishers .",
    "although this discontinuity is due to the simplified assumption of unconditional punishment , and partially contradicts with real - life experience in that it prohibits a stable coexistence of second - order free - riders and punishers , it nevertheless outlines a succinct and viable solution of the second - order free - rider problem that is in line with recent advances @xcite . altogether , the presented results strengthen the established importance of the spatial structure in promoting collaborative efforts @xcite as well as in stabilizing punishment @xcite , and suggest that elaborating further on the particularities of pool - punishment in structured populations , especially with methods of statistical physics @xcite , may improve our understanding of the origin of institutions .",
    "the public goods game is staged on a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "players play the game with their @xmath40 nearest neighbors .",
    "accordingly , each individual belongs to five different groups containing five players each .",
    "initially each player on site @xmath41 is designated either as a punisher ( @xmath42 ) , cooperator ( @xmath43 ) or defector ( @xmath44 ) with equal probability . using standard parametrization ,",
    "the two cooperating strategies p and c contribute @xmath45 to the public good while defectors contribute nothing .",
    "the sum of all contributions in each group is multiplied by the factor @xmath0 , reflecting the synergetic effects of cooperation , and the resulting amount is equally divided among the @xmath46 members irrespective of their strategies .",
    "pool - punishment requires allocating resources by means of which free - riders can subsequently be punished .",
    "each punisher therefore contributes an amount @xmath1 to the punishment pool that is subtracted from its payoff . since the resources for pool - punishment",
    "are actually committed before the collaborative effort , both free - rider types are exposed .",
    "cooperators , whose second - order free - riding can stay undetected by peer - punishment , are spotted just as readily as the defectors .",
    "the amount withheld from the common pool by defectors is , however , larger than the one withheld by cooperators . to take this into account and enable `` fair punishing '' , each defector is punished with a full fine @xmath4 , while the fine for second - order offenders is reduced by a multiplication factor @xmath3 . denoting the number of punishers ( p ) , cooperators ( c ) and defectors ( d ) in a given group @xmath47 by @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively , the payoffs @xmath51/(k+1 ) - 1 , \\nonumber \\\\ p_{\\rm c}^g&=&[r(n_{\\rm p}+n_{\\rm c})-\\delta \\gamma]/(k+1 ) - 1 \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,{\\rm and } \\nonumber \\\\",
    "p_{\\rm d}^g&=&[r(n_{\\rm p}+n_{\\rm c } ) - \\gamma]/(k+1 ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are obtained by each player @xmath41 depending on its strategy @xmath52 .",
    "since pool - punishment corresponds to an institutionalized system that operates population - wide irrespective of local considerations , the costs and fines are subtracted from the appropriate players irrespective of their neighborhoods .",
    "unconditional _ execution of punishment takes into account the `` invisible hand '' of justice looming over the free - riders .",
    "although being a simplification ( for an alternative treatment see @xcite ) , it accounts for the fact that the same effect is missing by peer - punishment , where the threatening omnipresence of a sanctioning institution is absent and the execution of punishment is therefore neighborhood - dependent .",
    "however , since punishers contributing to the punishment pool may not be strong enough in numbers to actually gather enough resources to punish all the free - riders in a population , the necessity to assess the sustainability of pool - punishment emerges .",
    "the account balance @xmath53 of the punishment pool is thus defined , where @xmath54 are the stationary fractions of strategies on the @xmath55 square lattice . if @xmath6 the pool has a zero or positive balance , and thus the pool - punishment is said to be sustainable .",
    "conversely , if @xmath7 the resources needed to execute punishment exceed the contributions to the pool , and accordingly , the pool - punishment is unsustainable .",
    "it is also possible to argue that even a small amount of punishers can still ensure enough resources to punish free - riders .",
    "situations where @xmath39 and @xmath7 can be referred to appropriately as being conditionally sustainable .",
    "the stationary fractions of punishers @xmath24 , cooperators @xmath25 and defectors @xmath32 on the square lattice are determined by means of a random sequential update comprising the following elementary steps .",
    "first , a randomly selected player @xmath41 plays the public goods game with its @xmath56 interaction partners as a member of all the @xmath57 groups it belongs to .",
    "the overall payoff it thereby obtains is thus @xmath58 .",
    "next , one of the four nearest neighbors of player @xmath41 is chosen randomly , and its location is denoted by @xmath59 .",
    "player @xmath59 also acquires its payoff @xmath60 identically as previously player @xmath41 .",
    "finally , player @xmath59 imitates the strategy of player @xmath41 with the probability @xmath61\\}$ ] , where @xmath62 determines the level of uncertainty by strategy adoptions or its inverse @xmath63 the so - called intensity of selection @xcite . in the @xmath64 limit player @xmath59",
    "unconditionally imitates player @xmath41 if @xmath65 .",
    "conversely , in the @xmath66 limit all information about the payoffs is lost and player @xmath59 changes its strategy by means of a coin toss . without the loss of generality we set @xmath67 @xcite , implying that better performing players are readily imitated , but it is not impossible to adopt the strategy of a player performing worse .",
    "such errors in judgment can be attributed to mistakes and external influences that affect the evaluation of the opponent .",
    "each full monte carlo ( mc ) step involves all players having a chance to adopt a strategy from one of their neighbors once on average .",
    "depending on the proximity to phase transition points , the linear system size varied from @xmath68 to @xmath69 and the equilibration required up to @xmath70 full mc steps for the finite size effects to be avoided ."

    "<S> @xcite , the first experiment on public goods with punishment @xcite actually considered pool- rather than peer - punishment . an important advantage of collecting resources for punishment ahead of the collaborative effort , as in paying towards a sanctioning institution , is the fact that second - order free - riders are easily spotted and are thus submissive to being punished . </S>",
