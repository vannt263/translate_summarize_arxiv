    "this paper reports on some recent progress that has been made in the analytical modeling of defect formation , far from threshold , in pattern forming physical systems .",
    "we will take a moment here to very briefly sketch the physical and mathematical background that motivates what is done in this paper .    the relevant class of pattern - forming physical systems to consider are those in which the spatial physical field can be described as planar and the first bifurcation from a homogeneous state , having arbitrary translational symmetry in the plane , produces a striped pattern which has only a discrete periodic symmetry in one direction .",
    "this _ symmetry - breaking _ occurs at a critical threshold ; above this threshold the pattern can deform and , further away , _ defects _ can form .",
    "it is the desire to understand and model this process of defect formation that motivates our study .",
    "a good particular example of these kinds of physical systems is a high prandtl number rayleigh - bnard convection experiment .",
    "the critical threshold in this example is the critical rayleigh number at which fluid convection is initiated from the sub - threshold homogeneous conducting state .",
    "the `` striped pattern '' here can be taken to be the horizontal cross - section of the temperature field at the vertical midpoint of the experimental cell in which _",
    "convection rolls _ have formed .",
    "because of its periodic structure , the striped pattern can be described in terms of a periodic form function of a _ phase _ , @xmath0 , where the magnitude of @xmath1 is the wavenumber of the pattern and the orientation of @xmath1 is perpendicular to the stripes . here",
    "@xmath2 is a physical point in the plane .",
    "even though the striped pattern will deform far from threshold , over most of the field ( and in particular away from defects ) it can be locally approximated as a function of a well - defined phase , @xmath3 , for which a local wavevector can be defined as @xmath4 which differs little from a constant vector unless one varies over distances on the order of many stripes in the pattern .",
    "this slowly - varying feature of pattern formation far from threshold motivates the introduction of a _ modulational _ ansatz in the microscopic equations describing these physical systems from which an order parameter equation for the behavior of the phase can be formally derived .",
    "this was originally done by cross and newell @xcite .",
    "these equations are variational and from our perspective it is advantageous to study their solutions by studying the behavior of the minimizers of the variational problem . the version of the variational problem that we study corresponds to the following energy functional on a given domain @xmath5 with specified dirichlet boundary values .",
    "@xmath6    which is expressed in terms of _ slow _ variables stemming from the modulational ansatz mentioned above : @xmath7 .",
    "we refer to this functional as the _ regularized cross - newell _ ( rcn ) _",
    "energy_. it consists of two parts : a non - convex functional of the gradient ( the cn part ) plus a quadratic functional of the hessian matrix of @xmath8 , which is the regularizing singular perturbation . without this regularization ,",
    "the cn variational equations admit non - physical caustic formation . instead , by studying the limit of minimizers of @xmath9 as @xmath10 , one may be able to identify the formation of a physical defect as a limiting jump discontinuity or other kind of singularity in the wavevector field associated to the @xmath11-indexed family of minimizing phase fields .    for more details on",
    "what has been rather tersely outlined above , we refer the reader to @xcite where analytical results on the asymptotic limit of minimizers for rcn and their defects in certain geometries are also derived .",
    "see also @xcite where further refinements and generalizations are developed .",
    "we further mention that the variational problem associated to ( [ eq : gl ] ) also arises in other physical contexts ( unrelated to pattern formation ) where it is known as the _ aviles - giga energy _ @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the focus of this paper .",
    "the kind of defects that are seen to arise far from threshold are not supported by asymptotic minimizers of ( [ eq : gl ] ) if the class of functions over which one is varying is restricted to be single - valued phases . in particular",
    ", one can see for purely topological reasons that this restriction rules out _ disclinations _ @xcite . in @xcite , physical , numerical and experimental arguments",
    "are developed which make a strong case in support of the hypothesis that the correct order parameter model for the phase in pattern forming systems far from threshold should come from a variational problem admitting test functions which are _ multi - valued _ and in particular _ two - valued_. in physical parlance this is often expressed by saying that the wavefield @xmath1 should be allowed to be a _ director field _ ; i.e. an unoriented vector field .",
    "one figure ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sh - zip ] below ) from @xcite will help to crystallize the issue and the focus of this paper .",
    "this figure shows seven numerical simulations , each done in a horizontal strip , of a solution to the _ swift - hohenberg equation _ which is a generic model of microscopic equations for a pattern forming system .",
    "each of these is run far from theshold but with differing boundary conditions imposed at the edges . in each case",
    "the boundary conditions impose a constant orientation of the stripe at the edges such that the normal to the stripe is @xmath12 along the top edge and @xmath13 along the bottom edge .",
    "the only thing that changes from one simulation to the next is the value of @xmath14 which in the figure is recorded on the left in each respective cell .",
    "the results of @xcite together with symmetry considerations establish that for an analogous domain and boundary values , the asymptotic minimizers of ( [ eq : gl ] ) , within the class of single - valued phases , should have the form shown in the bottom - most cell of figure ( [ fig : sh - zip ] ) .",
    "that is , they should have wavevectors very close to @xmath12 in the upper region of the cell and very close to @xmath15 in the lower region of the cell with a boundary layer around the mid - line in which the wavevector transitions smoothly but rapidly from one state to the other .",
    "these minimizers are dubbed _ knee solutions _ in @xcite and in the limit as @xmath10 , they tend to a configuration in which there is a sharp jump in the wavevector along the mid - line .",
    "this kind of defect is called a _",
    "grain boundary_. in other words , the theory for ( [ eq : gl ] ) with single - valued phases predicts that the grain boundary should be the limiting defect independent of the value of @xmath14 .",
    "the different result appearing in figure ( [ fig : sh - zip ] ) was one of the pieces of evidence sited in @xcite to argue the necessity for the larger variational class of multi - valued phases , even in such simple geometries as those of figure ( [ fig : sh - zip ] ) . in this paper",
    "we are going to carry out a careful analytical study of the rcn variational problem in exactly this geometry but within a larger class of two - valued phases .",
    "we will firmly establish that the form of the asymptotic minimizers in this more general model does in fact depend non - trivially on @xmath14 .",
    "in addition , the construction of test functions in section [ sec : u_bound ] and the numerical simulations in section [ sec : results ] gives some intuitive and experimental support to the belief that the stable solutions of the rcn equations qualitatively resemble what is seen in the swift - hohenberg simulations . in @xcite ,",
    "the term swift - hohenberg `` zippers '' was coined to refer to the problem studied in figure ( [ fig : sh - zip ] ) . in this paper",
    "we will be studying _",
    "cross - newell zippers_.",
    "we are given an angle @xmath14 that determines the boundary conditions on the pattern as @xmath16 by @xmath17 note that this differs from the setup underlying the swift - hohenberg zippers in that the boundary conditions are placed at @xmath18 in the @xmath19-direction rather than at finite values of @xmath19 .",
    "this simplifies our technical considerations in that we do nt need to worry about adjusting the location of these boundaries as @xmath14 changes .",
    "also , all of the patterns we want to consider here are _",
    "shift - periodic _ in the @xmath20-direction .",
    "this allows us to reduce our study to domains that are periodic in @xmath20 .",
    "we introduce the ( small ) parameter @xmath21 and we define the period @xmath22 .",
    "we consider the following variational problem on the strip @xmath23 :    minimize @xmath24 $ ] given by @xmath25 = \\iint_{{\\mathcal}{s}^\\epsilon } \\left\\ { [ \\delta \\theta]^2 + ( 1 - |\\nabla \\theta|^2)^2 \\right\\ } dx dy\\ ] ] over all @xmath26 , \\delta \\in \\mathbb{r}$ ] and @xmath27 satisfying the boundary conditions @xmath28 \\in h^2({\\mathcal}{s}^\\epsilon ) .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] we take a moment here to explain the considerations that have motivated the mixed dirichlet - neumann boundary conditions here , the first two boundary conditions in ( [ eq : bc ] ) above .",
    "we argued in the introduction that in order to capture the physically relevant minimizers , the rcn variational problem needed to allow for multi - valued phases in its admissible class of test functions .",
    "however , the numerical results on the swift - hohenberg zippers suggest that in certain symmetrical geometries the appropriate multi - valuedness can be introduced in a tractable fashion . indeed in the case of the sh zippers we see that the symmetry of the boundary conditions between the upper and lower edges of the domain is preserved in the symmetry of all of the exhibited solutions about the middle horizontal axis ; i.e. , the reflection in @xmath19 about the @xmath29 axis .",
    "this suggests that a single - valued phase could describe the solution in the upper half - plane with the solution in the lower half - plane given as a symmetric reflection of that in the upper half - plane about @xmath29 .",
    "figure  [ fig : bcs ] illustrates two instances of the form that we expect these zippers to take in the infinite ( in @xmath19 ) geometry .",
    "the figure on the left illustrates level curves ( _ stripes _ in the parlance of the introduction ) of what we will shortly define to be a _ self - dual knee solution_. this is indeed symmetric about the mid - axis , which we will take to be the @xmath29 axis ; moreover , one can see that its gradient field along @xmath29 is tangential to this axis .",
    "thus the gradient field in the upper half - plane is completely symmetrical to that in the lower half - plane under reflection about @xmath29 .",
    "however , for the striped pattern on the right in figure  [ fig : bcs ] , this is not the case .",
    "there are regions , illustrated for example by the darkened interval along @xmath29 , where the gradient field is tangential to this axis ; but , there are other regions , illustrated for example by the lightened interval along @xmath29 , where the gradient field needs to be perpendicular to this axis . by reflection symmetry this field will point upwards in the upper half - plane and downward in the lower half - plane",
    ". this can not be supported by a vector field but it is allowable for a director field .",
    "this indicates that in this region a two - valued phase is required .    to get at the conditions on the phase itself we observe that patterns of the type illustrated here are analytically given in terms of a form function @xmath30 of the phase @xmath31 such that @xmath30 is locally periodic of period @xmath32 in @xmath27 and such that @xmath33 is even in @xmath19 and smooth in @xmath34 . in order to allow",
    "@xmath27 to be two - valued we also require @xmath30 to be even in @xmath27 .",
    "( an example of a global form function having these properties is @xmath35 . )",
    "it follows from these requirements that either @xmath36 is even in @xmath19 , in which case @xmath37 , a neumann boundary condition ; or , @xmath36 is an odd function of @xmath19 modulo @xmath38 , in which case @xmath39 for some integer @xmath38 , a dirichlet boundary condition .",
    "thus to realize the pattern on the right in figure  [ fig : bcs ] in terms of a single - valued phase in the upper half - plane , we would need to take the neumann boundary condition on the darkened interval and the dirichlet boundary condition on the lightened interval .",
    "this is what we have done in ( [ eq : bc ] ) . for the self - dual knee pattern on the left we would take the entire boundary condition to be neumann .",
    "the functional @xmath40 is the rcn energy functional but with the scaling @xmath11 removed .",
    "it is appropriate to do this because the demonstration that the nature of the rcn minimizers depends on @xmath14 is independent of this scaling .",
    "the first and the second conditions impose a mixed dirichlet / neumann boundary condition at @xmath41 , the third condition imposes ( shifted- ) periodicity in @xmath20 and the last condition ensures that the test functions @xmath27 approach the straight parallel roll patterns @xmath42 as @xmath43 .",
    "note that the dependence of the functional @xmath40 on the parameter @xmath44 is through the dependence of the domain @xmath45 and the boundary conditions on @xmath44 .",
    "the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 are determined by minimization .",
    "the parameter @xmath46 is a measure of the fraction of the boundary at @xmath48 that has a dirichlet boundary condition , and @xmath47 represents the _ asymptotic phase shift _ , that is the difference in phases between the test function @xmath27 and the roll pattern @xmath49 which satisfies @xmath50 .",
    "the case where @xmath46 is set to zero is considered in earlier references @xcite .",
    "the test functions @xmath36 satisfy a pure neumann boundary condition at @xmath41 and the minimizers in this case are the self - dual knee solutions @xmath51 these solutions have an asymptotic phase shift of @xmath52 and the energy of the minimizers in the strip @xmath45 is given by @xmath53 = \\frac { 4 \\pi \\sqrt{1-\\epsilon^2}}{3 \\epsilon}. \\label{eq : chevrons}\\ ] ]    the existence of @xmath54 minimizing @xmath40 can be shown from the direct method in the calculus of variations .",
    "we also prove the following results about the minimizers , and their energy     _ upper bound _    there is a constant @xmath55 such that @xmath56 \\leq    e_0 $ ] for all @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "[ thm : u_bound ]    we prove this result in sec .  [",
    "sec : u_bound ] by exhibiting an explicit test function satisfying this bound .",
    "note the implication that the minimizers for sufficiently small @xmath44 can not be the self - dual solutions , since the energy in eq .",
    "( [ eq : chevrons ] ) diverges as @xmath58 .",
    "consequently , @xmath59 for sufficiently small @xmath44 .",
    "_ lower bound _    there are constants @xmath60 and @xmath61 such that , even for the optimal test function @xmath62 and the optimal parameter values @xmath63 and @xmath64 , we have @xmath65 \\geq    e_1 $ ] for all @xmath66 .",
    "further , there are constants @xmath67 such that @xmath68 for sufficiently small @xmath44 .",
    "[ thm : l_bound ]    we prove this result in sec .  [",
    "sec : l_bound ] . combining this result with the preceding theorem",
    ", we obtain a rigorous scaling law for the energy of the minimizer , and for the quantity @xmath69 as @xmath58 . as a corollary to theorem  [ thm : l_bound ]",
    ", we find that an @xmath70 part of the energy of the minimizer concentrates on the set , @xmath71 .",
    "this can be interpreted as saying that a nontrivial part of the energy of the minimizer lives in the region of the convex - concave disclination pair @xcite .",
    "we will first show an upper bound for the enrgy functional @xmath72 , uniform in @xmath44 , by constructing a family of explicit test function whose energy is uniformly bounded .",
    "the idea for the construction of these test functions comes from the self - dual ansatz @xcite which requires that the energy density of the functional @xmath73 should be _ equi - partitioned _ between its two terms .",
    "functions satisfying this ansatz solve the self - dual ( resp .",
    ", anti - self - dual ) equation : @xmath74 solutions of this equation can be constructed via the logarithmic transform @xmath75 which reduces ( [ eq : selfdual ] ) to the linear helmholtz equation ( [ selfdual ] ) .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for more background on self - dual reduction .",
    "we consider the helmholtz equation in the upper half - plane , @xmath76 subject to the mixed boundary conditions @xmath77 and with asymptotic behavior for large @xmath19 given by const .",
    "@xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "we seek a shift - periodic solution , meaning that we change variables to @xmath81 and look for periodic solutions of @xmath82 with boundary conditions of periodicity in @xmath20 of period @xmath83 ; mixed boundary conditions at @xmath29 , @xmath84 and with asymptotic behavior for large @xmath19 given by const .",
    "given such a @xmath86 , @xmath87 would satisfy the boundary conditions ( [ eq : bc ] ) .",
    "( however , for notational simplicity , in the remainder of this section we will set @xmath88 . )",
    "we now let @xmath45 denote the half - cylindrical domain , @xmath83-periodic in @xmath20 and with @xmath89 .",
    "the existence of a weak solution to ( [ shiftper ] ) satisfying the above boundary conditions can be established via the lax - milgram theorem with appropriate energy estimates .",
    "however , in order to derive uniform asymptotic energy estimates ( as @xmath90 ) for the cn zipper problem we need to go beyond existence results and try to construct a more explicit representation of the solution to ( [ selfdual ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , at present , the solutions one can construct using greens function methods and the like do not yield sufficient a priori boundary regularity near @xmath29 to control the asymptotic behavior of the energy in this _ finite _ part of @xmath45 . we will therefore instead study solutions of a self - dual problem with modified boundary conditions ( more precisely , with pure dirichlet boundary conditions ) .",
    "subsequently we will make a local modification of these solutions near the boundary to produce functions ( no longer global self - dual solutions ) whose asymptotic energy we can control _ and _ which are valid test functions for the cross - newell zipper problem .",
    "the modified boundary value problem we consider is ( [ shiftper ] ) with ( [ 5]-[6 ] ) replaced by the pure dirichlet boundary condition    @xmath91 where @xmath92 is a function which smoothly interpolates , up through second derivatives , between @xmath93 at @xmath94 on the left and @xmath95 at @xmath96 on the right .",
    "there are clearly many choices for such a function ; the precise choice for our purposes will be made later at the end of subsection [ energy ] . by elliptic regularity @xcite , the solution to this boundary value problem satisfies @xmath97 . in the following sections we will construct the solutions to this problem and study its asymptotics relative to the rcn energy @xmath98 .",
    "the whole plane green s function for the helmholtz equation ( [ selfdual ] ) is explicitly given in terms of the bessel potential @xcite : @xmath99    in terms of this green s function we can then represent a solution to ( [ selfdual ] ) , with asymptotic behavior for large @xmath19 given by const .",
    "@xmath100 , as    @xmath101    note that    @xmath102    solves ( [ selfdual ] ) with respect to the standard dirichlet boundary condition which equals minus the jump of @xmath103 along the @xmath20-axis .",
    "one may check directly ( see ( [ ft ] ) ) that in fact @xmath104 almost everywhere . integrating ( [ dirbase ] ) with respect to @xmath19",
    "gives    @xmath105    since both @xmath106 and the rhs of ( [ intdirbase ] ) decay as @xmath107 , it follows that @xmath108 .",
    "this is consistent with the ansatz ( [ soln ] ) , taking @xmath109 to be the jump in the normal derivative of @xmath110 along @xmath29 .",
    "we make the following shift - periodic ansatz for @xmath111 ,    @xmath112 with this one can expand out ( [ soln ] ) more explicitly as    @xmath113 @xmath114 in ( [ 11 ] ) we have interchanged the order of integration which is justified by tonelli s theorem ; in ( [ 12 ] ) we ve made the substitution @xmath115 and in ( [ 13 ] ) we ve commuted the sum past the integrals which is justified by monotone convergence  all terms in the series are positive and hence the partial sums are monotonic .",
    "in ( [ 14 ] ) we write each summand as a single exponential and then appropriately complete the square in each exponent . finally in ( [ 15 ] ) we apply jacobi s identity @xcite .",
    "here @xmath116 is one of the jacobi theta functions , in this setting explicitly given as @xmath117    finally , from ( [ 15 ] ) we can express our candidate for the solution to ( [ shiftper ] ) , ( @xmath118 ) as @xmath119 where @xmath120 .      from the previous sections we have that @xmath121 is periodic of period @xmath83 ; also @xmath122 is periodic in @xmath20 of period @xmath83 and @xmath123 along @xmath124 when @xmath29 .",
    "moreover , taking the fourier transform of ( [ shiftpersoln ] ) one finds that the fourier coefficients , in @xmath20 , must satisfy @xmath125 for each value of @xmath19 .",
    "taking the limit as @xmath126 on both sides of ( [ ft ] ) gives @xmath127 this is a determining conditions for @xmath121 .",
    "we note that differentiating ( [ ft ] ) with respect to @xmath19 and setting @xmath128 demonstrates that @xmath129 , at least in the @xmath130 sense .    since @xmath131 , it follows , by comparison , that @xmath132 .",
    "given this we can now define @xmath133 which characterizes @xmath134 as an element of @xmath135 .",
    "it follows from sobolev s lemma @xcite that @xmath134 can be taken to be continuous .",
    "this last observation also justifies the existence of the fourier coefficients @xmath136 that were formally introduced in ( [ ft ] ) .",
    "we now determine the large @xmath19 asymptotics of ( [ soln ] ) . by ( [ ft ] ) , @xmath137 has a fourier representation given by @xmath138 ( we note that for large @xmath19 this series converges uniformly to a smooth , in fact real - analytic , function of @xmath20 . )",
    "moreover , @xmath139 is non - zero since by the maximum principle @xcite applied to the elliptic pde ( [ shiftper ] ) on the cylinder @xmath140 \\times \\left(-\\infty , \\infty\\right)$ ] , the integrand , @xmath141 , is non - negative and in fact , by ( @xmath142 ) , non - vanishing on @xmath140 $ ] ( the definition of @xmath143 which we give later will insure that this is so ) .",
    "we will now try to show that the regularized cross - newell energy of @xmath144 is uniformly bounded in @xmath44 .",
    "this would establish a uniform ( in @xmath44 ) upper bound for the energy minimizers . recall that the energy is calculated by integrating the energy density over the domain @xmath45 . making",
    "this estimate breaks naturally into the consideration of two regions : @xmath145 \\times \\{y\\geq m_\\epsilon\\}$ ] and @xmath146 \\times \\{y < m_\\epsilon\\}$ ] where @xmath147 is to be determined .",
    "we remark that the so - called `` knee solution '' of the self - dual equation provides an upper bound for the energy for values of @xmath44 bounded away from zero .",
    "so we only need to be concerned with small values of @xmath44 .",
    "since @xmath148 solves the helmholtz equation , it will suffice to bound the density @xmath149 ( since the integral of this density equals that of @xmath150 for self - dual solutions ) .",
    "we begin by considering the domain for large @xmath19 . since    @xmath151    we may reduce our considerations to studying the asymptotics of @xmath137 and its first derivatives .",
    "it will be convenient to replace the convolution integral in ( [ shiftpersoln ] ) by the fourier series whose coefficients are the product of the fourier coefficients of @xmath134 and the @xmath116 series .",
    "this results in the following alternative representation of @xmath137 :    @xmath152    with the change of variables , @xmath153 this representation takes the form @xmath154 where @xmath155 .",
    "the critical point of the exponent is @xmath156 and the expansion of the exponent in the @xmath157 term of the series near this critical point has the form @xmath158 an asymptotic expansion in large @xmath19 may be developed for the integral in each term of the series ( [ asympw ] ) by the method of laplace . by the uniform convergence of the series ( for large @xmath19 ) , the asymptotic expansion of the series is equivalent to the sum of the asymptotic expansions from each term .",
    "we implement this strategy to find the leading order , large @xmath19 behavior , and next corrections , for @xmath137 , @xmath159 and @xmath160 :    @xmath161    where in the @xmath162 term of each series , @xmath163 , respectively .",
    "we can now apply laplace s method to each term and then observe that the dominant contributions for large @xmath19 come from the @xmath164 fourier modes .",
    "retaining just these we derive the following asymptotic behavior for @xmath165 :    @xmath166    based on these asymptotics we can now estimate the energy in the large @xmath19 domain .",
    "@xmath167 from which it follows that @xmath168 and so the energy density @xmath169 > from this it follows that the `` large @xmath19 '' part of the total energy is bounded as @xmath170 thus , if we take @xmath171 , this part of the total energy will remain finite as @xmath90 .",
    "we next turn to consideration of the energy density in the _ finite _ part of the domain . to facilitate this consideration",
    "we will sometimes make the uniformizing change of variables @xmath172 and @xmath173 in the jacobi theta function ( [ jacobi ] ) : @xmath174 in what follows we will assume that @xmath46 is chosen to depend on @xmath44 in such a way that @xmath175 .",
    "we will make use here of the following single - layer potential counterpart of the double - layer potential representation ( [ shiftpersoln ] ) , which in fact can be deduced directly from a change of variables in ( [ asympw ] ) :    @xmath176 @xmath177    we study the asymptotic behavior of the convolution integral in ( [ shiftpersoln2 ] ) for @xmath178 and for _ times _ @xmath179 of order less than @xmath180 :    @xmath181    where in the third line above , the form of the integrals follows from making the change of variables as in ( [ perjacobi ] ) . in the second integral",
    "we smoothly extend @xmath182 to be zero on @xmath183 .",
    "the final line follows for @xmath179 of order less than @xmath180 because in this regime the jacobi theta function inside the convolution behaves as a _ dirac comb _ as @xmath90 .",
    "the second term has this asymptotic behavior because @xmath184 and the support of @xmath185 is complementary to this interval , so that this integral decays exponentially to zero with @xmath44 , as with a dirac sequence away form its support .",
    "based on ( [ convoest ] ) we can estimate @xmath137 as @xmath186 + \\mathcal{o}\\left(e^{-1/\\epsilon}\\right)\\\\ & = & e^{\\epsilon x } e^{-\\sqrt{1-\\epsilon^2}y}+ o(\\epsilon).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the evaluation of the previous integral may be deduced from a basic bessel identity ( see @xcite 9.6.23 ) .    in order to estimate @xmath187 , we also need to estimate the @xmath20 and @xmath19 derivatives of @xmath188 .",
    "to this end we first consider the @xmath20-derivative of the internal convolution integral which equals @xmath189 integrating by parts , the above derivative may be rewritten as @xmath190 as for the second integral in the last line of ( [ convoest ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath191 for the @xmath19 logarithmic derivative we have    @xmath192    the last equivalence follows from a bessel recurrence identity @xcite , formula 9.6.26 , together with formula 9.6.6 .",
    "thus we finally have    @xmath193    and hence @xmath194 . since the domain @xmath195 \\times \\left\\{y < m_\\epsilon\\right\\}$ ] has dimensions @xmath196 , the total energy in this region is also asymptotically finite .",
