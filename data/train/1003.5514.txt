    "@xmath5 , the standard approach to pricing options on realized variance is to approximate realized variance by @xmath13_t,\\ ] ] where @xmath14 $ ] is the quadratic variation of the log - price @xmath5 .",

    "e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem i.4.47 ) ) .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that for many stochastic processes , the quadratic variation is a well - studied object .",
    "for example , as recently shown by @xcite , the characteristic function of the quadratic variation in any affine stochastic volatility model can be computed as the solution of a generalized riccati differential equation , such that in many cases methods based on fourier - laplace inversion ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) can be applied to compute option prices efficiently . moreover , using quadratic variation in place of realized variance , allows  at least in diffusion models  for elegant replication arguments , such as the the representation of a variance swap as an infinite portfolio of european options ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the quality of the approximation , or more precisely , the speed of convergence of realized variance to quadratic variation as the number of subdivisions @xmath2 increases has been studied extensively in the econometric literature .",
    "barndorff - nielsen and shephard @xcite , for example , obtain a central limit law for the difference between realized variance and quadratic variation , scaled by the square root of @xmath2 , which holds in a large class of stochastic volatility models ( compare also @xcite for more general results ) .",
    "however , an important difference from the econometric setting to the setting of variance options is that the sampling frequency @xmath2 for such options can not be chosen freely , but is determined by market convention . as mentioned above",
    ", daily sampling is the typical case . from an econometric point of view , this sampling frequency would most likely be considered insufficiently low to produce an acceptable estimate of quadratic variation over most reasonable time horizons @xmath15 . for variance options ,",
    "though , not pointwise estimation under the physical measure is the goal , but the accurate risk - neutral pricing and hedging of options with specific payoffs .",
    "therefore it is not clear to what extent findings from econometrics can be transferred . for this very reason",
    "several articles have considered the quality of the approximation purely from the point of view of option pricing .",

    ", bhler @xcite observes that `` _ _ while the approximation of realized variance via quadratic variation works very well for variance swaps , it is not sufficient for non - linear payoffs with short maturities .",
    "the effect is common to all variance curve models ( or stochastic volatility models , for that matter ) . _ _ '' in particular , he presents some numerical examples based on call options on realized variance in the heston model , that indicate that the approximation by quadratic variation notably diverges from the true value for short maturities ( cf .",
    "this leads to the following questions considered in the present study :    1 .",
    "to what extent is it indeed true that quadratic variation is not a good proxy for realized variance , when pricing short - dated options with non - linear payoffs ?",
    "2 .   how can options on the realized variance be valuated more accurately ?    the remainder of the article is organized as follows .",
    "we first consider exponential lvy models in section  [ sec : levy ] and compare the small - time limits of options on quadratic variation and on realized variance . based on the results we propose a new method to approximatively evaluate prices of options on realized variance . in section  [ sec : semimartingale ] we show that the results on exponential lvy models can be transferred without modification to general semimartingale models . in section  [ sec : exact ] we propose a second  exact  pricing method for options on realized variance , which is based on fourier - laplace methods .",
    "we present numerical examples and compare the two methods in section  [ sec : example ] and then conclude with some suggestions for future research .",

    "hence one objective for future research will be to test its numerical performance for stochastic volatility models with and without jumps . for affine stochastic volatility models ( see for example @xcite ) , a class which includes the heston model , the svj and svjj models of @xcite and most time - change based stochastic volatility models , the results of @xcite could be used as a starting point . since our approximation method `` freezes '' the stochastic volatility at time zero , one would expect it to perform worse for stochastic volatility models . on the other hand ,",
    "sepp @xcite has obtained encouraging results for the heston model with a similar method .    our second method , the exact fourier - laplace approach from section  [ sec : exact ] , could also be possibly extended to stochastic volatility models .",
    "again the class of affine stochastic volatility models seems particularly suitable , since in such models the log - price @xmath5 and the stochastic variance process @xmath325 have a joint conditional characteristic function of the form @xmath326 } = \\exp\\big(\\phi(t - h , u , w ) + v_h \\psi(t - h , u , w ) + x_h u\\big),\\ ] ] for @xmath327 .",
