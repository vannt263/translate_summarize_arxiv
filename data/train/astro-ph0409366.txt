    "in [ 1,2,3 ] we discuss the importance of radiative feedback on the co - evolution of mbhs at the center of spheroidal galaxies and that of their stellar and gaseous components . after assessing the energetics of the radiative feedback by using the results in [ 4 ] , in [ 1,3 ]",
    "we demonstrate that the observed relation between the mbh mass and the stellar velocity dispersion can be the natural consequence of the mbhs growth at early times in the galaxy history and the gas depletion of the galaxy gaseous content due to star formation . in particular , in [ 1 ]",
    "we show that _ radiative feedback from the central agn is effective in halting accretion _ when the gas temperature is @xmath1 k , and the mass of the mbh has grown to a critical value : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the stellar velocity dispersion in the spheroid , @xmath4 is its mass , @xmath5 is the accretion luminosity . under the assumption that @xmath6 during the phases of significant growth of the central mbh ( e.g. , [ 5,6,7 ] ) , one can derive a condition on @xmath7 in order to satisfy the @xmath8 relation observed today ( e.g. , see [ 8,9,10 ] ) : @xmath9 in [ 1,3 ] , with the aid of a simple yet physically motivated toy model , we show that such low - density , hot - temperature phases for the ism are established early in the lifetime of stellar spheroids as a natural consequence of galaxy formation .    in our simulations we always find that at the epoch of the transition between cold and hot solutions @xmath10 , in very good agreement with the request of eq .",
    "remarkably , if in our toy model we adopt duty - cycles of the order of those obtained in numerical hydrodynamical simulations and also derived from observations @xmath11 , see [ 5,6,7 ] ) , we obtain present - day mbhs that follow the observed scaling relations .",
    "substantially longer duty - cycles with ( very ) low accretion efficiencies are not a viable alternative , because in this case accretion would be dominated by bondi accretion , resulting in too massive mbhs .",
    "gas heating due to the evolving galaxy stellar component in its various forms ( stellar winds thermalization , snii and snia explosions ) , is confirmed to be an important ingredient in galaxy evolution . due to their shallower potential",
    "well , low mass galaxies host stronger galactic winds than more massive galaxies . in the toy model agn heating",
    "is not sufficient `` per se '' to produce galaxy degassing , even though is able to maintain the ism temperature near to the galaxy virial temperature .",
    "thus , a plausible ( and observationally supported ) scenario for the coevolution of mbhs and stellar spheroids , is the following : at early times in the galaxy life , when the protogalactic gas was dense and cold , star formation and mbh growth were approximately parallel [ 7 ] .",
    "later on , due to the mbh growth on one side and the gas depletion ( due to star formation and reduced cosmological infall ) on the other , @xmath12 reaches the value @xmath13 . after this",
    ", accretion is characterized by a short duty cycle , of the order of @xmath14 , with only a marginal growth of the central bh , even in presence of the non negligible stellar mass losses of the passively evolving stellar population [ 11 ] ."
