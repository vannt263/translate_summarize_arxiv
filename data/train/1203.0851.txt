    "the notion of an iterated function system ( abbrev . ifs ) , introduced by john hutchinson in 1981 @xcite , has proven to be a fertile field of research as well as a versatile and useful tool in lossy data compression ( especially where image data is concerned ) .",
    "this paper is a study in one specific aspect of the theory - the possibility of encoding a particular set as an attractor of an ifs .",
    "we now recall some basic terminology .",
    "let @xmath2 be a complete metric space .",
    "a map @xmath3 is called a _ contraction _ if there exists a constant @xmath4 such that for every @xmath5 we have @xmath6 .",
    "a map @xmath3 is called a _ weak contraction _ if for every @xmath5 , @xmath7 we have @xmath8 . a family @xmath9 of ( weak ) contractions @xmath10",
    "is called a _ ( weakly contracting ) iterated function system _ ( see @xcite ) . given a compact @xmath11 define @xmath12 this transformation , acting on the space of nonempty compact subsets of @xmath13 with the hausdorff metric , is called the _ barnsley - hutchinson operator_.    it is shown in @xcite that every ifs has a unique attractor .",
    "analogous fact is also true for any weakly contracting ifs .",
    "m. hata proved in @xcite that if the attractor of some ifs is connected , then it is also locally connected .",
    "m. j. sanders showed in @xcite that every arc of finite length is an attractor for some ifs .",
    "additionally , he has proven that if @xmath14 is an endpoint of some arc @xmath15 which has the properties :    1 .   for all @xmath16 the length of the subarc of @xmath17 with endpoints @xmath18 and @xmath19 is finite , 2 .   for every @xmath20 the length of the subarc of @xmath17 with endpoints @xmath18 and @xmath14 is infinite ,    then @xmath17 is not an attractor of any ifs acting on @xmath0",
    "one example of such arc is the harmonic spiral @xcite .",
    "the example of m. kwieciski from @xcite may also be easily modified to satisfy these assumptions .",
    "it is elementary to check that every continuum in @xmath21 is an attractor of some ifs .",
    "moreover , any embedding of such continuum in @xmath21 is still an attractor of some ifs . in dimesion two and higher",
    ", however , the situation becomes more complex .",
    "our results provide a sufficient condition for a continuum to be embeddable in @xmath0 so that its image is not an attractor of any ifs .",
    "let @xmath2 be a metric space , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "consider all the sequences @xmath25 such that @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "denote by @xmath31 the infimum of the sums @xmath32 for these sequences .",
    "define @xmath33 .",
    "this limit may be infinite .",
    "it is elementary that if @xmath34 then @xmath35 .",
    "[ main ] let @xmath36 .",
    "let @xmath37 be a continuum .",
    "assume that there exists an @xmath38-dimensional hyperspace @xmath39 such that @xmath40 and @xmath41 is connected .",
    "assume additionally that for every @xmath42 there exists @xmath43 which is a neighbourhood of @xmath44 such that @xmath45 .",
    "then there exists an embedding @xmath46 such that @xmath47 is not an attractor of any ifs .    by applying an affine transformation",
    "we may assume without loss of generality that @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50\\times[-1,1]^{n-1}$ ] .",
    "next define @xmath51 as @xmath52 @xmath53 then define the embedding @xmath46 as the composition @xmath54 .",
    "speaking colloquially , @xmath55 transforms @xmath56 into a sharp needle , while @xmath57 bends that needle to fit into a thickened - up graph of the function @xmath58 . as a result of the second transformation the needle becomes , speaking imprecisely , of infinite length .",
    "figure [ needle ] illustrates the process for @xmath59 .     for @xmath59,width=300 ]",
    "the map @xmath55 does not increase distance , and therefore for every @xmath60 there exists @xmath61 which is a neighbourhood of @xmath62 such that @xmath63 .",
    "note that , outside of any neighbourhood @xmath64 of @xmath62 , the expansivity constant of @xmath65 is bounded from above .",
    "this implies that for every @xmath66 there exists @xmath67 which is a neighbourhood of @xmath68 such that @xmath69 .",
    "consider now a contraction @xmath70 with a lipschitz constant @xmath71 .",
    "we would like to prove that if @xmath72 then @xmath73 .",
    "to this end , conjecture that @xmath74 is not constant and @xmath72 .",
    "assume first that @xmath75 .",
    "fix any @xmath76 such that @xmath77 .",
    "note that the sequence @xmath78 is convergent to @xmath68 .",
    "also note that by the assumptions @xmath79 is finite and additionally @xmath80 .",
    "but this would imply that @xmath81 is also finite , while it is not , since it can be seen from the definition of @xmath57 that @xmath82\\times[-1,1]^{n-1})$ ] is infinite .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath83 then there exist @xmath76 such that @xmath84 and @xmath85 such that @xmath86 . then @xmath87 would be finite and @xmath88 would be infinite , which contradicts the contractivity of @xmath74 , completing the proof that if @xmath74 takes value @xmath68 on at least one argument then it has to be constant .",
    "consequently , if @xmath89 is the barnsley - hutchinson operator for some ifs and @xmath90 , then @xmath91 may comprise of @xmath92 and possibly also finitely many other closed sets not containing @xmath68 .",
    "but then @xmath93 , proving that @xmath47 is not an attractor of @xmath89 .",
    "the assumptions of theorem [ main ] are technical and may seem very restricitve .",
    "its assertion , however , is true not only for the continua that satisfy them directly , but also for the continua that may be embedded in @xmath0 in such a way that their image satisfies them .",
    "this significantly widens the class of sets the theorem is useful for .",
    "for example , if any two points in the continuum @xmath15 can be connected in @xmath17 by a path of finite length , then it can be easily seen that the wedge sum of @xmath17 and @xmath94 $ ] may be embedded in @xmath95 so that the assumptions of theorem [ main ] are satisfied .    after the result of hata @xcite it has been an open problem whether every locally connected continuum in @xmath0 is an attractor of some ifs .",
    "the example of kwieciski @xcite provided a negative answer , but the same question for weakly contracting ifs s remains , to our best knowledge , open .",
    "we shall now give an example of a subcontinuum of @xmath1 that is not an attractor of any weakly contracting ifs .",
    "we now switch to a polar coordinate system @xmath96 on @xmath1 . put @xmath97 and @xmath98 for @xmath99 . for",
    "any @xmath99 choose a broken line segment @xmath100 without self - intersections , consisting of finitely many intervals , that starts at @xmath101 , ends at @xmath102 , has the total length of @xmath103 , and is contained in @xmath104\\cup\\{p_n\\}$ ] .",
    "define @xmath105 .",
    "the space @xmath106 is not an attractor of any weakly contracting ifs .",
    "suppose that @xmath107 is a weak contraction .",
    "we shall examine how many of the points @xmath108 can belong to @xmath109 .",
    "if @xmath110 then there is a neighbourhood @xmath64 of @xmath111 such that @xmath112 and @xmath64 contains finitely many points @xmath108 and almost all of the sets @xmath113 .",
    "note that only finitely many of the sets @xmath113 may reach outside of @xmath64 . also observe that each @xmath113 covers at most finitely many points @xmath108 because the lengths of @xmath114 are not increased by @xmath74 ( this elementary property of contractions can be proven either by using @xmath115-chains , or , as in @xcite , by using the fact that @xmath74 does not increase one - dimensional measure ) .",
    "consequently , only finitely many of the points @xmath108 belong to @xmath109 .    if , on the other hand , @xmath116 , then , given @xmath99 , note that @xmath102 may not belong to @xmath113 for @xmath117 , because the lengths of these sets are too small to traverse the whole @xmath100 .",
    "but no other point in @xmath106 can be mapped onto @xmath102 by @xmath74 , because @xmath74 decreases the distance between @xmath101 and any other point . therefore , the only point @xmath108 present in @xmath109 is @xmath101 .    in conclusion ,",
    "if @xmath89 is a weakly contracting ifs , then only finitely many of the points @xmath108 can belong to @xmath118 , and therefore @xmath106 is not an attractor of @xmath89 .",
