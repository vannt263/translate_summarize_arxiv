    "the galaxies seem to favor dark matter halos that have a soft core while cosmological halos are cuspy .",

    "both galaxies have been subjects of high resolution studies , including their kinematics . in order to illustrate the degree of disagreement with cosmology , we quote @xcite , who find that a model of ngc  6822 with a realistic dm halo gives an outstandingly bad fit : @xmath5 .",
    "the goal of this paper is to design relatively detailed models for ngc 3109 and ngc 6822 , and use the models to evaluate the severeness of the conflict that they pose for the @xmath1cdm model .",
    "the standard way of constructing mass models for galaxies is to adjust parameters of analytical functions until the model circular velocity produces acceptable fits to the observed rotation curve .",
    "however , this approach suffers from some shortcomings .",
    "it is usually difficult to test the self - consistency of models : whether the observed gas and stellar kinematics are consistent with the assumed mass distribution .",
    "disk stability against bar formation is another self - consistency test .",
    "these potential caveats are known and have been used before to reduce the model parameter space in rotation curve analysis @xcite .",
    "however , these problems are often ignored .",
    "it is not infrequent to see in literature that models that explain observed rotation curves have a maximum disk that is likely to be unstable for bar formation .",
    "in other situations , axisymmetric models are used to explain the kinematics of barred lsb galaxies , as pointed by @xcite . in many of these cases ,",
    "questionable results are taken as an evidence for cored halos .    motivated by all these caveats and by the frequency of non - circular motions and non - axisymmetric structures in the observations of dwarf galaxies ,",
    "in this paper we consider barred models , and study the corresponding non- circular motions . given that many of the dwarf irregular galaxies show photometric or kinematic lopsidedness , we also consider this kind of models .",
    "in addition , we use the constraints on the stellar mass provided by observed colors of the stellar population .",
    "we make high resolution simulations with several millions of particles moving in a self - consistent gravitational field for billions of years , that assure dynamical self - consistency .",
    "once the simulations finish , we `` observe '' the models closely mimicking procedures applied to real observational data @xcite .",
    "models constructed in this way include a number of effects , which are normally difficult to account for analytically : projection effects , finite disk thickness , effects related to complex non - circular motions , adjustment of the dark matter to the presence and evolution of baryons .",
    "this procedure can be applied to pure gravitational systems , which allow re - scaling and make it possible to fit a specific galaxy .",
    "there are reasons to believe that the rotational velocities of the gas and stars in dwarf galaxies are not very different . @xcite and @xcite addressed this issue observationally .",
    "they found that in the central @xmath0  kpc region of late - type ( nearly bulge - less ) galaxies , stellar and gas rotation curves are very similar to each other . at larger distances ,",
    "gas rotates slightly faster than the stellar component that , as one would naively expect , has some intrinsic velocity dispersion .",
    "judging by the magnitude of the rotational velocity , one expects that in dwarf galaxies such as ngc  3109 the random velocities are small : 10 - 20  , which is close to the random velocities of hi clouds .",

    "dark matter halo assumes a zero stellar mass - to - light ratio and a concentration close to zero , which is hard to justify not to mention that it systematically over predicts the rotation velocity inside the central kiloparsec . a model with a reasonable halo concentration",
    "was rejected with very high confidence .    yet",
    ", the galaxy is far from being simple .",
    "the stellar distribution shows a short , but rather strong bar , which is prominent in visible light .",
    "this is clearly seen in figure  8 of @xcite : the distribution of light in the central @xmath21  is misaligned with the hi at large radii .",
    "the misalignment is quite large : @xcite and @xcite give the position angle of the bar @xmath22 , while the position angle of the hi disk is about @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "this bar was considered the main stellar body of the galaxy ; it has an exponential profile .",
    "however , deeper photometry reveals a fainter blue component tracing the hi distribution @xcite .",
    "there is also a faint and rounder red stellar component extending to several radial scale lengths @xcite .",
    "the neutral hydrogen and the faint blue stars show a different position angle compared with the stellar bar .",
    "the central surface brightness in b - band is 27  mag@xmath24 .",

    "all these properties make ngc  6822 one of the nearest barred lsb galaxies .",
    "however , the bar has not been considered in previous analyses of ngc  6822 kinematics @xcite .",
    "in order to test the validity of our conclusions based on collisionless simulations ( see also @xcite ) , we made high resolution hydrodynamical simulations of a dwarf galaxy .",
    "these simulations can not be rescaled because they include gas dynamics and radiative processes . therefore",
    ", fitting them to a specific galaxy is difficult .",
    "however , they can shed light on the physical processes playing a role in dwarf galaxies with a significant gas component . in this section",
    "we are mostly interested in a simulation , which produced a weak bar because this comes along with what we find in ngc  3109 and ngc  6822 .",
    "results of other simulations are presented in the appendix .",

    "the choice of parameters for the simulations was motivated by parameters of ngc  3109 and ngc  6822 .",
    "the main parameter is the maximum circular velocity . after evolving for 1  gyr the model",
    "had a maximum circular velocity 70  , which is very close to that of the real galaxies .",
    "just as in real galaxies , the disk - to - halo ratio in our models is very small . in next sections we show that our best models for the galaxies have @xmath25 .",
    "we selected this value for our hydrodynamical models .",
    "note that this is almost 7 times smaller than the average ratio of baryons to dark matter in a @xmath1cdm universe .",
    "even with this small mass the disk makes a significant contribution to the circular velocity in the central 1/3  kpc .",
    "though a reasonable match to real galaxies for some parameters , the hydrodynamical model does not reproduce all the properties of dwarf galaxies .",
    "most notably , the disk is more compact than the disk of the galaxies that we are studying .",
    "the simulations were evolved with the multi - step parallel tree / sph code gasoline @xcite .",
    "the code includes hydrodynamics , star formation , radiative and compton cooling for a primordial mixture of hydrogen and helium as well as stellar and sn feedback .",
    "feedback is modeled as thermal energy dumped into the gas near to star particles .",
    "the deposition rate is tied to stellar lifetimes .",
    "the affected gas has its cooling shut off for 20  million years , mimicking pressure support from ( unresolved ) internal turbulence @xcite .",
    "the only free parameters ( star formation efficiency and the fraction of sn energy dumped into the interstellar medium ( ism ) have been tuned over a range of galaxy masses to reproduce a number of observables @xcite .",
    "those include the shape and normalization of the schmidt law of our own milky way galaxy and the typical disk thickness , the star formation rates and the gas turbulence observed in small galaxies .",
    "our simulation has initially 2  million particles and has 30  pc softening for gas and stellar component and 60 pc for the dark matter particles .",
    "the force is newtonian at @xmath4 60 pc .",
    "we follow the evolution only for 1  gyr .",
    "dynamically , this is a very long period for the dwarf `` galaxy '' : 11 orbital periods at 1  kpc distance .    during the period of bar formation the halo of model h1",
    "is contracted adiabatically due to the disk evolution @xcite .",
    "the bar forms very quickly ( in about 100  mrs ) .",
    "after that initial period the system is in a quasi - stationary state : gas show only small radial velocities ( see figure  [ fig : hydro ] ) .",
    "although we analyze the simulation at @xmath4 1 gyr there is not a particular reason for that .",
    "the model h2 was simulated twice : with and without the star formation .",
    "the disk in this model is more extended than in the model h1 . as the result",
    ", the model is dominated by the dark matter even in the central region .",
    "the model did not produce a bar after 1  gyr of evolution .",
    "figure  [ fig : hydro ] shows the structure of the disk as well as the velocity field and radial motions of the cold gas .",
    "the distribution of the cold gas is remarkably complex .",
    "there is a weak bar , which extends in radius to only 1  kpc .",
    "there are spiral arms . at",
    "the resolved scales the gas shows a complex structure with cold filaments and holes filled with dilute and relatively hot gas . at these temperatures ( @xmath26k ) and densities the hot gas cools relatively quickly .",
    "consequently , there should be a source of energy and a mechanism to replenish the hot gas .",
    "both are provided by the star formation .",
    "the star formation rate @xmath27yr is relatively low and is comparable with observational estimates of @xmath28yr for ngc  6822 @xcite .",
    "large ( 100 - 300  pc ) holes and lumps in the distribution of the cold gas observed in figure  [ fig : hydro ] are typical for small real galaxies .",
    "for example , figure  8 in @xcite shows numerous 1 - 3  arcmin ( 100 - 300  pc ) holes and lumps in the distribution of the neutral hydrogen for ngc  6822 . @xcite",
    "give a catalog of 19 holes with size larger than 200  pc in another dwarf galaxy ddo  47 .",
    "the same situation  numerous holes , filaments , and lumps  is found in the smc @xcite , lmc @xcite , ho ii @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the multi - phase medium , which we find in our simulation , is characteristic for dwarf irregular galaxies such as ngc  3109 and ngc  6822 studied in this paper .",
    "the observed velocity field in the central @xmath29 region of model is presented in figure  [ fig : hydro - vfield ] .",
    "the noisy behavior of contours in the left panel is due to super - bubbles , which induce @xmath30 motions in the surrounding cold gas .",
    "the same kind of `` noise '' is observed in real galaxies , if observations are done with high resolution . only after significant smoothing we find a normal `` spider diagram '' similar to figure  1 in @xcite . in this diagram",
    "the presence of the bar is a rather subtle effect  a twist of contours in the central 1  kpc area  and can easily be overlooked .",
    "qualitatively the same twist of contours in the velocity field is observed in the ngc  6822 velocity map ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 6 ) . in order to quantify the magnitude of the motions , we estimate the rms velocities in different parts of the model . to some degree",
    "we follow the observational procedure . in observations",
    "the velocity dispersion is often estimated using the gaussian width of emission lines .",
    "this is done with some spatial filtering . in order to mimic the observations",
    ", we estimate the one - dimensional velocity dispersion of the cold gas ( @xmath31k ) .",
    "we use different filter sizes ( box sizes of 50 , 100 , and 200 parsecs ) to make maps of the observed rms velocity across the whole galaxy .",
    "for all cases the average and the most frequent value for the rms velocity in the pixels are 8 and 6  km / s respectively .",
    "thus , local estimates of the velocity dispersion in our model are relatively small and are constant .",
    "this is compatible with what is measured in real galaxies at the scale of tens and few hundreds of parsecs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these values of the rms velocity would normally imply that gas motions are negligible and gas motion faithfully tracks the mass distribution .",
    "figure  [ fig : hydrorotcur ] shows that this is not true : cold gas rotates slower than expected .",
    "the figure presents azimuthally averaged velocities of different components in the model h1 .",
    "we show the `` true rotation curves '' @xcite : velocities are defined for components in the disk plane .",
    "an observer would need to consider in addition projection effects that make the rotation even smaller for most view angles @xcite ( see section [ sec : models ] for details ) .",
    "we note that the disk is now a dominant component in the central region of the `` galaxy '' .",
    "the plot shows another important property : the cold gas and the stellar component rotate with similar speeds in the central region , in agreement with the observations reported by @xcite and @xcite . the main difference between both curves are features related with gas shock waves and an offset of few kilometers per second in amplitude .",
    "it is interesting to apply traditional estimates of the density reconstruction using the rotation curve of the cold gas of the model h1 .",
    "we use the following relation @xcite to find the total density @xmath32 when the cold gas moves with velocity @xmath33 : @xmath34    this equation assumes a neglegible disk , which is considered as reasonable for lsb galaxies .",
    "if the model were treated as a real galaxy , the non - circular motions would be estimated as negligibly small .",
    "we already mentioned the rms velocities @xmath35 estimated using line widths .",
    "the average point - by - point variations of velocities also appear to be small : @xmath36 .",
    "adding in quadratures any of those estimates to the `` observed '' rotation velocity makes very small effect on the rotation curve .",
    "for example , at @xmath37 the rotational velocity is @xmath38 . adding in quadratures @xmath39 gives @xmath40 , which is significantly smaller than the circular velocity of @xmath41 at that radius .",
    "we emphasize that the non - circular velocities only appear to be small .",
    "this is how they would be measured by an `` observer '' . in reality",
    "the magnitude of the non - circular motions is larger and their effect is significant .",
    "appendix gives more extended discussion of effects non - circular motions and pressure gradients , as well as the corrections necessary to apply to gas kinematics in order to recover the circular velocity .",
    "figure  [ fig : hydrodens ] presents the true density profile and the recovered profile . at distances @xmath42 the rotation of the cold gas",
    "gives a good estimate for the true density in the system .",
    "yet , at smaller radii the cold gas systematically and substantially underestimates the density .",
    "we emphasize that projection effects can make the density underestimation even stronger @xcite .    in the appendix",
    "we give analysis of the discrepancy .",
    "we show that the true density can be recovered , but this requires accurate and careful account of numerous effects . without this",
    ", one can get a wrong conclusion that the density in the central region has a core while it actually has a cusp .",
    "we also present results of two other simulations ( two variants of the model h2 ) , which address issues of the resolution and the star - formation feedback . in the simulation without the stellar feedback the cold gas rotates very close to the circular velocity of the system .",
    "thus , feedback is definitely responsible for a large fraction of the discrepancy . in the simulation with feedback , but without a bar , the discrepancy is present . yet , it is not as strong as in the model h1 , which has both the feedback and the bar .",
    "we draw two important conclusions from the analysis of the hydrodynamical simulations : ( i ) the cold gas can rotate slower than the circular velocity .",
    "this happens in the central regions of galaxies due to the combined effect of the stellar feedback and a weak bar .",
    "( ii ) in the central regions the gas rotation and the rotation of the stars are quite comparable .",

    "we call the model with smaller initial displacement `` mildly lopsided '' and the model with larger displacement `` strongly lopsided ''",
    ".      the standard procedure used to fit a mass model to a galaxy requires one to vary the model parameters , such as the dark matter halo mass and concentration and the stellar m / l ratio , until the model circular velocity reproduces the observed rotation curve .",
    "disk structural parameters are fixed by the galaxy photometry . in some cases this procedure leads to very small values for the stellar",
    "m / l not always in agreement with the observed colors for the galaxy @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the observed colors of the stellar disk are used in combination with a stellar population synthesis model in order to assign a stellar mass to light ratio ( m / l ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "there are some potential drawbacks to this method .",
    "the procedure assumes that gas and stars in the disk move with the local circular velocity .",
    "however , in many cases there is evidence of non - circular motions in the central regions of galaxies @xcite , which are difficult to take into account .",
    "in addition , the hot gas component can give pressure support to the cold gas , as we find in our hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "another potential complication is that parameters of the model are varied freely in order to reach a good fit without any guarantee of self consistency . as a result",
    ", the dynamical stability of the model is questionable . in some cases",
    "the available observational data give a maximum disk model that is unstable to strong spiral arms or bar formation .",
    "however the kinematics of the model is calculated as if it were axisymmetric , stable and supported only by rotation .",
    "this subject has received some attention by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is crucial in order to give an accurate interpretation of the observed rotation curves . even if a galaxy is globally dominated by dark matter",
    ", it can develop a strong and healthy bar @xcite . as a result of the instabilities discussed above , the importance of non - circular motions and in some cases the asymmetric drift correction can be under - estimated assuming an exponential , infinitely thin and axisymmetric disk at all radii .",
    "several dwarf and lsb galaxies show deviations from these assumptions particularly in the central regions .",
    "the thickness of galactic disks is another issue .",
    "it is correctly considered for the calculation of the disk potential @xcite .",
    "however , it also has a projection effect on the kinematics @xcite and possibly in asymmetric drift correction ( see appendix ) .",
    "we adopted a different modeling procedure that accounts in a realistic way for deviations from axisymmetry and that assures self - consistency .",
    "the method is similar to the ones applied to high surface brightness barred galaxies @xcite ) . instead of an analytic rigid model",
    "we have a high resolution n - body realization of our system that is evolved for many disk rotation periods .",
    "since gravity is a scale - free force , it is well known that an n - body simulation can be re - scaled using two independent variables .",
    "we use this freedom to make the models more realistic .",
    "we use the spatial @xmath58 and velocity @xmath59 scales .",
    "thus , if @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the original coordinates and velocities , the rescaled variables are @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "once @xmath58 and @xmath59 are fixed , the mass scale @xmath64 is defined by @xmath65 .",
    "the first step of the method is to rotate and tilt our model using the observed galaxy position angle ( pa ) and inclination .",
    "afterward we scale the maximum circular velocity in the model to the maximum rotation velocity observed in the galaxy , we also change the spatial scale in order to fit the disk radial scale length .",
    "the next step is to fix the bar parameters .",
    "the radial surface brightness profile is an useful constraint on the strength and length of the bar @xcite .",
    "we use the observed profiles of isophotes ellipticities and pa to fix the bar orientation .",
    "this quantity also has a strong influence on the projected surface density .",
    "bar orientation is an important constraint also for kinematics .",
    "it is well known that the effect of non - circular motions on the rotation curve is very sensitive to this parameter @xcite .",
    "this effect is larger when the bar is orthogonal to the line of sight and the velocities of many stellar and gas orbits are orthogonal to the observer too .",
    "if the orientation of the bar is along the line of sight , the galaxy would appear to have a small bulge and the kinematics would overestimate the circular velocity .",
    "however , this galaxy would be considered as consistent with a cuspy halo with a very high concentration , if no modeling of the non - circular motions is performed .",
    "once the disk and bar orientations are fixed , the standard tilted ring analysis is performed @xcite .",
    "we modify the spatial and velocity scales ( @xmath66 ) until we get a satisfactory match between the data points and our model `` observed '' rotation curve .",
    "we assumed an nfw density profile for the halo .",
    "the virial radius is defined as the distance where the halo overdensity is 340 times the average density of the universe .",
    "after scaling we have to re - calculate the value of the virial radius .",
    "this is done assuming the nfw profile as follows :    @xmath67    where @xmath68 the average density of the matter in the universe , @xmath69 is the halo concentration , and @xmath70 is the characteristic ( core ) radius of the nfw profile .",
    "the same relation could be written in order to define a relation between the original and scaled quantities :    @xmath71    here @xmath72 is the new ( scaled ) virial radius , while all the other quantities have the original non - scaled values .",
    "the halo characteristic radius @xmath73 is simply multiplied by the spatial scaling factor @xmath58 .",
    "this modifies halo concentration in a non - linear way : @xmath74 .    in order to mimic real observations we generated images in fits format from the stellar disks in our models",
    "the images are processed using iraf .",
    "we use the package stsdas and the task ellipse in order to define elliptical isophotes over the image .",
    "velocities are projected and integrated along the line of sight of an artificial observer .",
    "the isophotes are used for a tilted ring analysis that gives the rotation curve , the position angle and isophotal inclination profile as a result .",
    "this standard analysis assumes that the ellipticity of the isophotes is a measure of the corresponding ring inclination .",
    "our implementation of the algorithm has as an option to assign a global inclination and position angle or to leave these parameters to change as a function of radius .",
    "the method is described in detail by @xcite .",
    "we analyze our galaxy model after 3  gyrs of isolated evolution . at this stage",
    "the system evolves very gradually .",
    "its bar slightly grows and slows down .",
    "we tried different epochs and selected one which matches the observations .",
    "the rotation curve fit is not very sensitive to a particular epoch .",
    "figure  [ fig : n3109model ] shows the rotation curve of ngc  3109 and compares it with the azimuthally averaged rotation velocity in our model .",
    "we also show the surface brightness profile of the galaxy . assuming that mass - to - light ratio does not change with radius , we compare the observed surface brightness with the surface density ( scaled to surface brightness units ) of the stellar component in the model .",
    "figure  [ fig : n6822model ] shows the same for ngc  6822 .",
    "when matching the models with galaxies , we adjusted the position of the bars in order to reproduce the gradual change in the isophote orientation presented by @xcite for ngc  6822 and by @xcite for ngc  3109 .",
    "the resulting configuration is in reasonably good agreement with both pictures in the central region .",
    "figures  [ fig : n6822iso ] and [ fig : n6822isophotes ] show the surface density , pa and inclination angle recovered from isophotes for the model of ngc  6822 . figures  [ fig : n3109iso ] and [ fig : n3109isophotes ] present results for ngc  3109 .",
    "a striking result , which is apparent in figures  [ fig : n3109model ] and [ fig : n6822model ] , is that in our models the rotation predicted is smaller than the circular velocity .",
    "this important mismatch between the circular velocities and the observed rotation velocities is due to many effects .",
    "in addition to elliptical motions and to the asymmetric drift , there is an extra contribution coming from the fact that our simulated observations average particles at different heights and radii .",
    "this projection effect biases the measured velocity toward lower values @xcite .",
    "note that the non - circular velocities in the models are quite small and are comparable to cold gas motions in our hydro simulation .",
    "for example , the velocity dispersion of the stellar component in our models is smaller than 10   for radii larger than 1.5  kpc and it reaches 20   at the very center for the model of ngc  6822 .",
    "the model for ngc  3109 has a central value smaller that 30   and the amplitude of the rms motions decreases to less than 15   after 1.5  kpc .",
    "is the mass of the disks in our models acceptable ?",
    "after all , the baryonic disk is dominant in the central 0.5  kpc in the models .",
    "another issue is the ratio of the disk mass to the virial mass .",
    "our models have a disk - to - halo mass ratio of 2% .",
    "this is much smaller than the cosmological baryons - to - dark matter ratio 0.17 .",
    "is this a problem ?",
    "we do not think so .",
    "this is comparable to what is observed in real galaxies .",
    "for example , for our galaxy the ratio is ( 56)% @xcite .",
    "in fact , the ratio of 2% is probably realistic but on the high side for dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "the luminosity , the mass - to - light ratio , and the mass of neutral hydrogen in the disk are other important properties of galaxies , which a model should satisfy . knowing the luminosity of the galaxy and assuming a reasonable stellar mass - to - light ratio ( consistent with observed colors ) , we get an estimate of the stellar mass . observations also provide us with the mass of neutral hydrogen .",
    "we can make a correction for the helium to get an estimate of the total gas mass .",

    "@xcite gave the k - band luminosity @xmath94 for the galaxy , but we consider this value as a lower limit .",
    "the data covered only the central 1.6  kpc , which produces the luminosity @xmath95 and give a very short exponential lenght that correspond mostly to the stellar bar . @xcite extrapolated the surface brightness profile to larger distances using a one - component exponential model .",
    "for comparison with our model we will use data only inside 1.6  kpc radius . in our model the mass of the disk inside the radius is @xmath96 .",

    "just as for ngc  3109 , we assume that 30% of the total hydrogen is in the molecular form , and we use factor 1.4 to convert from total mass to hydrogen mass .",
    "there are additional complications with the two galaxies besides the stellar bar : ngc  6822 shows tidal tail - like features at large radii and ngc  3109 is lopsided and probably warped .",
    "these features may result in additional non - circular motions . in order to test these effects",
    ", we produced lopsided models .",
    "figure  [ fig : newmodels ] shows the stellar component and the rotation curves for the lopsided models .",
    "qualitatively results are similar to non - lopsided models . for the lopsided models",
    "the underestimation of circular velocity is even larger than for non - lopsided models because the centers of the kinematic and the mass distribution have a different locations , which leads to projection effects .",
    "in fact , the disk is not circular any more @xcite .",
    "there are several spiral waves and noncircular motions involved .",
    "the main difference with non - lopsided models is that the lopsided models allow more concentrated dm halos . for ngc  3109",
    "we get @xmath100 for mildly lopsided model and @xmath101  for the strongly lopsided model .",
    "when scaled for ngc  6822 , the models give even larger halo concentration .",
    "we conclude that lopsidedness does not change our main conclusions .",
    "it makes them even stronger .",
    "altogether we have four models for each galaxy .",
    "parameters of two lopsided models , which give better fits to observed galaxies , are given in the table  4 .",
    "our results are not the final models for both galaxies .",
    "we still lack reliable observational data on the magnitude of non - circular motions and estimates of the effects of the bar and lopsidedness on the kinematics of these galaxies .",
    "however , we show that using existing data it is possible to construct a family of models consistent with both cosmological predictions and with the observed properties of the baryonic component .",
    "table  [ tab : summary ] gives a summary of the properties of models for ngc  3109 and ngc  6822 .",
    "an important consequence of our results is that the deviations from axisymmetry may and often do bias the recovery of the distribution of mass in observed galaxies . in the case of ngc  3109 and ngc  6822 these biases are enough to explain the discrepancy between the observed rotation curves and the theoretically expected cuspy dark matter halos .",
    "following previous studies of ngc  3109 and ngc  6822 , we allow the pa and inclination to vary during the tilted ring analysis . for a comparison",
    ", we also run the analysis fixing these quantities to the average values measured along the disk .",
    "we find that the results are sensitive to the assumptions made about the pa and inclination profiles .",
    "our models for pa and inclination are in agreement with observations of @xcite and @xcite . in our models",
    "the changes in pa and inclination are created by the bar .    our interpretation of ngc  3109 and ngc  6822 as barred galaxies",
    "is supported by twists in the isophotes and in the iso - velocity contours ( figures 1 and 9 of @xcite , figures 5 and 6 of @xcite , figures 1 and 4 @xcite ) .",
    "many other dwarf galaxies also have variable pa and inclination as a function of radius and , thus , they also may have bars .",
    "the standard tilted ring analysis overlooks these variations by interpreting them as warps and assuming that the material out of the disk plane still moves with the local circular velocity which is not obvious @xcite .",
    "while warps are definitely frequent in galaxies , warps are believed to be produced by tidal interactions with a companion , a satellite or a triaxial dark matter halo .",
    "those interactions should _ increase _ with the distance from the center of the galaxy . yet , the changes in pa and inclination in ngc  3109 and ngc  6822 happen in the central @xmath0  kpc regions of the galaxies . in the case of ngc6822",
    "the presence of the bar as a feature in the stellar component is evident from the maps of the youg stellar component presented by @xcite wich is consistent with the central change of pa in the neutral hydrogen and out of phase with the tidal tails . in the case of ngc 3109",

    "however both possibilites : warps or oval distorions do not exclude each other , making the situation complicated . the ultimate answer will require a detailed modeling of the non - circular motions and the projection effects with methods similar to the ones discussed by @xcite , and it will also require the corrections to the kinematics discussed in the appendix .",

    "we emphasize that often those expectations are not based on any solid arguments .",

    "if the circular velocity is small ( @xmath121 km / s ) , as it happens in the smallest dwarf irregular galaxies and in the central regions of large disk galaxies , the pressure gradients triggered by star formation and feedback also contribute to the underestimation of the circular velocity even if the galaxy is axisymmetric .",
    "accurate measurements and correct treatment of variations in the position angle and inclination as a function of radius along the galactic disk are in some cases critical to set constraints on the mass distribution using rotation curves . if present ( as is often the case ) , those variations may indicate a bar or an ellipsoidal distortion .",

    "we find that those errors always _ underestimate _ the true density in the central parts of galaxies .",
    "if confirmed , our results suggest that there is no contradiction between the observed rotation curves in dwarf galaxies and the cuspy central dark matter density profiles predicted by the cold dark matter model .",

    "in this section we give more detailed analysis of hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "we also try to answer some questions regarding gas motion in those models .",
    "it is important to clarify that in most cases we will consider the rotation curve measured in the disk plane or the true rotation as in @xcite .",
    "an observer should consider the projection effects in order to recover the circular velocity .",
    "these projection effects are particularly considerable if the disk is not axisymetric .",
    "we start with an explanation of why the rotational velocity of the cold gas is significantly lower than the circular velocity as demonstrated by figure  [ fig : hydrodens ] . in order to disentangle different effects ,",
    "we make two runs of model h2 wich is axisymetric and dark matter dominated at each radii : one model includes only hydrodynamics and cooling and the other includes in addition star formation and feedback .",
    "model h2 does not form a bar after one gigayear .",
    "so , by comparing these runs we can study the effect of stellar and supernovae feedback in the absence of a bar or an oval distorsion .",
    "the left panel in figure  [ fig : nobar ] shows different velocity curves for the model h2 without the feedback .",
    "it is clear that in this case the cold gas has rotation velocity very close to the circular velocity .",
    "this test tells us that numerical effects are not responsible for the disagreement between the rotation and the circular velocities in the model h1 .",
    "the right panel in figure  [ fig : nobar ] indicates that the feedback is partially responsible for the discrepancy : in the model with the feedback the cold gas rotates systematically slower than in the no - feedback model . the difference between the rotation and the circular velocities is about 10% at most radii but it is different inside one radial exponential length .",
    "the absolute value of discrepancy is smaller than in the case of the barred model .",
    "still , the effect is definitely present , and it will affect more the slope of the recovered density profile than the average value of the central density . the ten percent difference seems to be small , and one would be tempted to neglect it . yet",
    ", it should not be neglected because another effect goes in the same direction and the cumulative effect of two seemingly small contributions is substantial .",
    "@xcite argued that due to the inclination , the `` observed '' rotation velocity is slightly smaller than the true velocity .",
    "the effect is relatively simple : for a disk with a finite thickness the average 3d radius at which the rotation is estimated is slightly larger than the projected distance .",
    "a combination of a rising rotation curve and a projection of the rotation velocity to the line - of - sight results in a smaller `` observed '' rotation velocity . for a typical inclination of @xmath122",
    "the effect is about 10% ( see figs 5 and 7 in @xcite ) .",
    "the combination of those two effects  projection and feedback  reduce the rotation velocity by at least 20% .",
    "when we use eq.([eq : rho ] ) to estimate the total density , we find that the `` observed '' density is only 0.64 of the true density .",
    "it is quite remarkable that 10% effects , which normally would be ignored , produce a factor of two underestimation of the total density .",
    "this is also a lesson : when dealing with rotation curves every effect on the level of @xmath123 must be included .    in order to understand other reasons for the disagreement between the large circular velocity @xmath124 and the small gas rotational velocity @xmath125",
    ", we consider and estimate different effects related to random velocities and pressure gradients .",
    "we can write an equation relating the circular and the rotation velocities of the gas , if we assume that gas with pressure @xmath126 and temperature @xmath127 has random bulk velocities with radial dispersion @xmath128 and velocity anisotropy @xmath129 . in this case the analog of the asymmetric drift correction is given by the following expression : @xmath130 here @xmath131 is the surface density of the gas , @xmath132 is the molecular weight , and @xmath133 is the hydrogen mass .",
    "this equation is the jeans equation in cylindrical coordinates with additional pressure terms .",
    "this equation is already a simplification because , as it is usually done , we neglect effects of a possible tilt of the velocity ellipsoid : @xmath134 .",
    "we also assume that the gas surface density is proportional to the gas density in the plane of the disk .",
    "note that in spite of the fact that gas has isotropic pressure , gas bulk motions in the presence of a bar or an ellipsoidal distorsion typically are not isotropic . in all our models",
    "the rms velocities in the disk plane are about equal : @xmath135 .",
    "this implies that @xmath136 . in the model with a bar the rms velocity perpendicular to the disk is about twice smaller than in the plane of the disk : @xmath137 . as a result of this anisotropy in the kinematics",
    "the observational estimation of the velocity dispersion in the disk plane will be affected by projection effects .",
    "left panel in figure  [ fig : hydrorot ] shows contribution of the stellar and the dark matter components to the circular velocity .",
    "here we use spherical approximation to estimate the circular velocity @xmath138 .",
    "it also shows the rms radial velocity @xmath139 of the cold gas , this estimation of the velocity dispersion includes small scale random velocities as well as large scale bulk motions created by the bar .",
    "we used this estimation of @xmath139 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : adcora ] ) . yet , this rms velocity is not what a typical observation would produce .",
    "depending on how the rms velocity is measured in real observations the results can be significantly different .",
    "the observed point - by - point rms velocity @xmath140 is a mixture of two contributions : @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "for example , for an inclination of 45  the `` observed '' @xmath143 , where we assume that @xmath144 .",
    "even @xmath140 is difficult to measure because of the clumpiness of the ism in dwarf galaxies and because of the noise in measuring of the velocities . as the result",
    ", observers typically report and use average rms velocity for the whole disk .",
    "this additionally reduces the value of the rms velocity because a large number of the pixels are in a region out of the bar or oval distorsion .",
    "if we apply these procedures to our model , we get @xmath145",
    ".    results of recovering the circular velocity from the rotation curve are presented in the right panel of figure  [ fig : hydrorot ] . to find the circular velocity we use the gravitational acceleration @xmath146 in the plane of the disk @xmath147 .",
    "just as many observers typically find , we also conclude that the standard asymmetric drift correction makes very little effect .",
    "when applying the standard correction , we use the true log - log slope of the surface density of the cold gas and assume a constant rms velocity . in the figure  [ fig : hydrorot ] the crosses are for the standard correction with @xmath148 . changing this value to 10",
    "does not make any difference .",
    "for example , at @xmath37 the rotation velocity is @xmath149 , the circular velocity is @xmath150 , and the log - log slope of the surface density is -1.8 .",
    "if we use @xmath151 , the correction gives @xmath152 : only a 2  difference !",
    "when we use the _ true _ local rms velocity @xmath153 , we get significantly larger corrected velocity of 47.5  .",
    "still , it does not bring us to the circular velocity , but it is getting much closer . at these small distances",
    "there is another factor , which should be included in the correction : the pressure gradient .",
    "effect of only the pressure gradient is shown as the dashed curve in the plot .",
    "it makes an impact at all radii , but at @xmath154 it is a small contribution . yet , at smaller distances it is important . at those distances",
    "the mass - weighted temperature of the gas in the plane of the disk is @xmath155  k. making all the corrections  for true @xmath139 and for pressure gradient  gives the corrected value of rotation velocity to 57  , which practically is the true circular velocity .",
    "triangles in the plot show results of application of the corrections at different radii .",
    "indeed , we recover the circular velocity .",
    "we can get additional information about the status of the cold gas by studying forces acting on individual gas particles .",
    "if the cold gas is in a quiet rotation , the gravitation and the centrifugal forces should be equal .",
    "( note that the average radial velocity of the gas is close to zero . )",
    "the top panel in figure  [ fig : acceleration ] shows that indeed at large radii ( @xmath156 ) the average gravitational acceleration of a particle is close to its centrifugal acceleration .",
    "yet , at smaller distances the situation is more complex . on average the force of gravity is larger than @xmath157 .",
    "because on average the gas does not move radially , this means that there is another force , which keeps the particles from falling to the center - the pressure force .",
    "the bottom panel in figure  [ fig : acceleration ] addresses the issue of the non - gravitational forces in a more direct way : we plot the deviations of the total acceleration @xmath158 from the gravitational acceleration @xmath146 . again , on average @xmath159 at radii @xmath160 and there are asymmetries at smaller distances , where on average @xmath161 .",
    "what is quite remarkable about this plot is the magnitude of the scatter .",
    "it is important to note that observed a factor of two deviations in the acceleration do not translate to significant deviations in velocities .",
    "for example , at @xmath162 the rms velocity is about 10   only a 15% deviation as compared with the rotation velocity . at the same distance the force deviations are a factor of three .",
    "here we are looking at the effect of the multiphase medium .",
    "particles of cold gas are pushed by the hot gas and get kicked by supernovae explosions . yet",
    ", particles do not move too far ( otherwise they would get large velocities ) .",
    "before long , they get pushed and kicked again in a different direction ."
