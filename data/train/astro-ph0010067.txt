    "thorn ( 2000 )  has shown that the odd ca abundances were not , as originally thought , due to nlte effects ( see also drake , 1991 ) , but wrongly calculated damping parameters .",

    "in order to , as efficiently as possible , study the behaviour of ca and departures from ionizational equilibrium in metal - rich dwarf stars we have selected stars with a wide range of effective temperatures ( @xmath0 k ) .    in our selection of stars we used stellar parameters derived from strmgren photometry using the calibration in olsen ( 1984 ) .",

    "attempts have been made to determine the abundances for this double star , but the uncertainties proved to be too large .",
    "however , the spectra show that the masses must be rather similar . assuming a similar metallicity ( [ fe / h]=0.15 ) of the two components the difference in masses ( which give the temperature and radius ) suggest one component of solar mass and one of slightly lower mass",

    "first they find that the two stars , with quite different metallicities , all the same respond with roughly the same changes in abundances because of the changes in model parameters",
    ".    in particular feltzing ( 1995 ) find that a change in effective temperature of + 200 k would decrease fe i with 0.03 dex and fe ii with 0.29 dex for hd 32147 , thus considerably reducing the apparent overionization .",
    "similar effects were found for hd 61606a and also for cr . a change in surface gravity of 0.4 dex would change the fe i abundance with 0.04 dex and the fe ii abundance with 0.21 dex , also almost erasing the overionization .",
    "fg98 found no compelling evidence to change the effective temperatures because they did not have a large enough span in excitation energy for the fe i lines to address excitation equilibrium in the coolest k dwarf stars ( they , however , conclude that `` we can not from our analysis exclude that the apparent pattern of overionization ... is due to a temperature scale several hundred k too low '' )",
    ". therefore they kept the effective temperatures and a change of 0.4 dex in the surface gravity was considered too large .",
    "the present study show that indeed for hd 32147 the effective temperature should be changed by + 200 k.    further , feltzing ( 1995 ) showed that a change of + 200 k meant a change around + 0.2 dex for na , ca , si , ti , and a -200 k change -0.2 dex for the same elements .",
    "si , cr ii , and fe ii would decrease with 0.15 -0.2 dex for an increase of + 200 k , and increase with the same amount if the change was 200 k.    the effects on sc ii , co , and ni are all smaller than 0.1 dex for changes as large as 200 k.    since our effective temperatures should have errors smaller or around 100 k we would expect the errors in derived abundances to be smaller than the ones quoted above .",

    "<S> the present study of spectra of twelve metal - rich cool dwarf stars , carefully selected in order to cover a range of temperatures ( @xmath0 k ) , is a follow up on feltzing & gustafsson ( 1998 ) with the aim to understand the apparent over - ionization and anomalous elemental abundances found by them for the k dwarf stars in their sample .    </S>",
    "<S> our method of analysis employs synthetic spectra of the full spectrum both to constrain the continuum level and to derive abundances . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that by using this method and imposing a strict excitation equilibrium ( possible to do because of the care in selection of observed fe i lines ) we are able to show that metal - rich k dwarf stars do not show anomalous stellar abundances , as indicated in feltzing & gustafsson ( 1998 ) , and can , with reasonable efforts , be analyzed in order to increase the number of metal - rich stars with useful chemical abundances .    with abundance analysis by means of spectrum synthesis and assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) the abundances of na , si , ca , sc , ti , v , cr , fe , co , ni , and </S>",

    "<S> also ionization balance is satisfied for fe and cr after correcting the stellar effective temperatures such that both ionization and excitation equilibrium were satisfied .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition , spectra from five cool dwarf stars of the feltzing & gustafsson ( 1998 ) sample have been analyzed with the methods used in this work . </S>",
