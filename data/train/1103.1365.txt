    "feedback stabilization of quantum states is closely related to the concept of quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) measurement  @xcite .",
    "indeed , as soon as we are interested in applying a measurement - based feedback to stabilize a quantum state , we need to make sure that the measurement itself is not changing the desired target state .",
    "this means that the measurement procedure is qnd with respect to the projection over the target state .",
    "in fact , very often a well - chosen qnd measurement protocol can itself be considered as a preparation tool for various quantum states . however , this preparation is generally non - deterministic and one can not make sure to converge towards the desired state except by repeating the experiment many times . the feedback can be applied here to make this process deterministic  @xcite .",
    "this paper is a generalization of the feedback law , proposed in  @xcite and experimentally tested in  @xcite , to generic discrete - time quantum systems where , between two successive qnd measurements , a controlled unitary evolution can be applied .",
    "the dynamics of such discrete - time quantum systems are governed by non linear markov chains . in  @xcite the feedback laws",
    "were obtained by maximizing the fidelity with respect to the target state at each time - step : this means that the feedback strategy was based on the same lyapunov function given by the fidelity between the current and the target state .",
    "we propose here a systematic and explicit method to design a new family of control - lyapunov functions .",
    "the main interest of these new lyapunov functions relies on the crucial fact that the increases of their expectation values at step @xmath0 knowing the state @xmath1 at step @xmath2 remain strictly positive when @xmath1 does not coincide with the target state . in closed - loop ,",
    "these lyapunov functions become strict and the convergence analysis is notably simplified since invariance principles are not necessary .",
    "the construction of these strict lyapunov functions is based on the hamiltonian @xmath3 underlying the controlled unitary evolution and relies on the connectivity of the graph attached to @xmath3 .",
    "they are obtained by inverting a laplacian matrix derived from @xmath3 and the quantum states that are untouched by the qnd measurements .    in section  [ sec : model ] , we describe the finite dimensional markovian model together with the main modeling assumptions . section  [ sec : openloop ] is devoted to the open - loop behavior ( theorem  [ thm : first ] ) that can be seen as a non - deterministic protocol for preparing a finite number of isolated and orthogonal quantum states . in section",
    "[ sec : closedloop ] , we present the main ideas underlying the construction of these strict control - lyapunov functions @xmath4 . then we define the connectivity graph , the laplacian matrix attached to @xmath3 and two technical lemmas used during this construction .",
    "finally theorem  [ thm : main ] describes the stabilizing feedback derived from @xmath4 .",
    "closed - loop simulations corresponding to an experimental setup at ecole normale suprieure are sketched in section  [ sec : simul ] .",

    "we consider a finite dimensional quantum system ( the underlying hilbert space @xmath5 is of dimension @xmath6 ) being measured through a generalized measurement procedure placed discretely in time . between two measurements , the system undergoes a unitary evolution depending on a scalar control input @xmath7 .",
    "the dynamics of such discrete time quantum systems is described by a non - linear controlled markov chain whose structure is derived from quantum physics .",
    "we just sketch here this structure with a mathematical viewpoint .",
    "a tutorial physical exposure can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the system state is described by the density operator @xmath8 belonging to @xmath9 the set of positive , hermitian matrices of trace one : @xmath10 the generalized measurement procedure admits @xmath11 different discrete values @xmath12 : to each measurement outcome @xmath13 is attached a kraus operator described by a matrix @xmath14 .",
    "the kraus operators @xmath15 satisfy the constraint @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the identity matrix .",

    "identity   yields @xmath83 we have used the fact that @xmath84 .",
    "thus , @xmath85 is a sub - martingale , and in addition we have a precise bound on the difference @xmath86 .",
    "we denote by @xmath87 the right term in equation  .",
    "note that the sum in the definition of @xmath87 is over all @xmath88 .",
    "however , we can assume that the sum is actually over all @xmath89 in @xmath27 by observing the following facts .",
    "for any @xmath89 , take the mapping @xmath90 defined only when @xmath91 .",
    "since this mapping is positive and bounded by @xmath92 , it can be extended by continuity to any @xmath33 by taking a null value when @xmath93 .",
    "thus @xmath94 is continuously defined for any @xmath33 and still satisfies @xmath95 by theorem  [ thm : app ] of the appendix , the @xmath96-limit set @xmath97 ( in the sense of almost sure convergence ) , for the trajectories @xmath1 , is a subset of the set @xmath98    let us consider a density matrix @xmath99 in the @xmath96-limit set .",

    "the goal is to design a feedback law that globally stabilizes the markov chain   towards a chosen target state @xmath138 , for some @xmath105 among @xmath139 . in previous publications",
