    "in heavy ion collisions and in anti - nucleon physics many pions are produced in the final state .",
    "pion - pion scattering will therefore play an important role in the final state interaction .",
    "our knowledge of @xmath0 scattering is incomplete , in particular above @xmath8 1  gev .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath0 scattering is often described by effective meson - exchange in the t - channel .",
    "however one may also consider the presence of many resonances in the s - channel , that distinguishes @xmath0 scattering from , for example , nucleon - nucleon scattering .",
    "for energies larger than 1 gev an additional aspect is its strong coupling to multi - pion channels , for example , four and six pions .",
    "previous models for @xmath0 scattering have been applied from threshold to 1.4 gev .",
    "for example separable potential models have been considered  @xcite in an approach in which the major focus was to find the right combination of attraction and repulsion in the diagonal @xmath9 interaction , to describe the proper low energy behavior of @xmath0 s - wave phase , and to better understand the structure of the f@xmath6(975 ) .",
    "more sophisticated one - meson exchange models  @xcite have been used up to 2 gev , also within the framework of coupling @xmath0 and @xmath10 channels .",
    "we have concentrated our work in the energy region of 1.0  2.0 gev , as one of our interests is the study of final state interaction in @xmath11 annihilation  @xcite , which requires knowledge of @xmath0 scattering in the 2 gev energy range .",
    "relevant experimental @xmath0 phase shifts and inelasticities were taken from the analysis by hyams et al  @xcite .",
    "this group has extracted a pion - pion scattering amplitude in the @xmath12 1.02 - 1.78 gev region from pion production in pion - nucleon scattering .",
    "two of their solutions and the low energy data from ref .",
    "@xcite are plotted in fig .",
    "1 . note the rather strong energy dependence of the phase shift and the inelasticity .",
    "we do not know of any higher energy data , so a model reproducing the existing data is needed for an extrapolation to 2 gev .",
    "we have redone the @xmath0 and @xmath13 coupled channel calculation of refs .",
    "@xcite up to 2 gev .",
    "we confirm their calculation , but note that above 1.4 gev the prediction fails to reproduce the data as can be seen in fig .",
    "1 . the dashed curve represents set 2 of table 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite and the solid curve set 2 of table 2 of ref .",
    "the lack of agreement shows the necessity to introduce more channels .    in view of the presence of an extensive set of resonances in @xmath0 scattering ,",
    "we have opted in this paper for a separable potential model similar to that of refs .",
    "@xcite . in the energy range of 1.0 - 2.0 gev",
    "the dominant channels are @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath14 . within our model , as no spin effects have been taken into account , the @xmath2 and @xmath3 channels can be described by a single effective channel , e.g. @xmath2 .",
    "the existing s - wave resonances that couple strongly to the @xmath0 channel are the f@xmath6(975 ) , f@xmath6(1400 ) , and f@xmath6(1710 ) .",
    "we impose the condition that the scattering matrix should have poles at the corresponding complex energies .",
    "section ii describes the model and shows the analytic expression of the s - matrix .",
    "section iii lists the parameter values for which the pole conditions are satisfied and gives the corresponding phase shifts and inelasticities .",
    "discussion of the results follows in section iv .",
    "as in ref .  @xcite we consider three channels but , in contrast with that work , all channels are completely coupled giving a different expression for the @xmath0 s - matrix .",
    "our method of derivation follows closely that of ref .",
    "we describe briefly how to obtain the scattering matrix .",
    "the three reduced schrdinger equations take the form    @xmath15    here the relative momenta , k@xmath16 , in the i@xmath17 channel , are related by the kinematic condition    @xmath18    furthermore    @xmath19    here the channels i=1,2,3 correspond to @xmath0 , @xmath10 , and @xmath2 respectively .",
    "we used @xmath20=0.1396 , @xmath21=0.4937 and @xmath22=0.7680 gev .",
    "we ignore the width of the @xmath23 meson .",
    "the interaction in this coupled three - channel model with separable s - wave potentials is described by a symmetric real 3x3 matrix of the form    @xmath24    we choose the commonly used form factors    @xmath25    for the above potentials , solutions of the eqs .",
    "[ schr ] can be written as    @xmath26.\\ ] ]    for incoming pions in channel 1 a@xmath27 is non - zero , a@xmath28 = a@xmath29 = 0 and the s - matrix element for @xmath30 is    @xmath31    the integrals @xmath32 can be done analytically and the coupled schrdinger equations lead to three algebraic equations with unknowns @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "one obtains    @xmath36    where d is the jost function    @xmath37/(r_1 r_2 r_3).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here , because of the special form factors of eq.[ff ] ,    @xmath38    the quantities @xmath39 , and @xmath40 are renormalized dimensionless couplings .",
    "we now require the s - matrix to have poles at the known j@xmath4 = 0@xmath5 resonances f@xmath6(975 ) , f@xmath6(1400 ) , and f@xmath6(1710 ) .",
    "there are three range parameters @xmath41 , and six couplings @xmath42 .",
    "the three poles are then chosen at the complex energies , ( re@xmath43 , im@xmath43 ) , respectively ( 0.975 , -0.0165 ) , ( 1.400 , -0.075 ) , and ( 1.709 , -0.350 ) gev providing six constraints on the nine parameters .",
    "the remaining freedom in the parameter space is narrowed down by the requirement that all off - diagonal couplings must be real .",
    "we present the values of the nine parameters and the corresponding values of the @xmath0 phase shifts , @xmath44 , and inelasticities , @xmath45 , as a function of total energy , @xmath43 , following the conventional parameterization of the scattering matrix element s@xmath46 = @xmath45 e@xmath47 .",
    "several sets of parameter values are given in table 1 .",
    "all solutions for the parameters share the feature that the interaction in the @xmath0 channel is repulsive and the interactions in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 channels are mainly attractive .",
    "the form factors in the @xmath48 and @xmath49 channels are relatively long ranged , while for the @xmath1 channel the form factor can be either short or long ranged .",
    "the resulting @xmath44 and @xmath45 , corresponding to the second ( solid line ) and fourth ( dashed line ) sets of parameters of table 1 , are given in fig .",
    "2 . as expected , the energy dependence of the inelasticity is closely related to the opening of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 channels ( see fig .",
    "this is also clearly seen from the band of solutions for @xmath45 representing the entire table 1 , shown in fig .",
    "the exact value of @xmath45 is very sensitive to the model parameters , in particular @xmath50 and the corresponding coupling @xmath51 of the @xmath0 and @xmath2 channels .",
    "the values of the phase shifts are far less sensitive to the choice of parameters .",
    "again this is seen from the spread of solutions for @xmath44 shown in fig .",
    "the phase shift is about 180 degrees at the opening of the @xmath1 channel and approximately 400 degrees at the opening of the @xmath52 channel .",
    "comparing with experimental analysis , we find the best agreement with the solution set (  ) and set ( + +  ) of ref .",
    "the authors of that work preferred set (  ) at the time of their analysis .",
    "we note that the data point for @xmath44 in their (  ) set at the highest energy could be increased by 180 degrees , which would be consistent with the sharp rise in the ( + +  ) data set .",
    "the global agreement of the predicted inelasticity in this simple model for several parameter sets of table 1 is remarkable ( see fig .",
    "3 . ) , even with the wide scatter of the experimental data .",
    "the overall behaviour of the inelasticity is determined by the opening of the higher channels , i.e. the branch cut structure of the s - matrix .",
    "the @xmath52-branch cut begins at @xmath53 = 2  m@xmath54 = 1.536 gev and that of @xmath3 at @xmath43 = 2 m@xmath55 = 1.564 gev .",
    "our model , which contains a realistic @xmath2 branch cut at @xmath43 = 1.536 gev , shows that the inelasticity starts to decrease sharply at about 1.4 gev . the experimental data exhibit a very similar behaviour . the data does not show any sign of a specific 4@xmath7-branch cut near 0.558 gev or 6@xmath7-branch cut near 0.837 gev .",
    "this indicates that the production of four and six pions occurs mainly via @xmath2 and @xmath3 formation .",
    "the behaviour of the phase shift is insensitive to modest variation of the ranges and couplings .",
    "however , @xmath0 phase shifts can be changed by modifying the position of the resonances , i.e. the pole structure of the s - matrix .",
    "for example , increasing the mass of the third resonance to 1.900 gev brings the phase shift into somewhat better agreement with the data , and at the same time preserves the structure of the inelasticity .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "4 .    in conclusion",
    ", we have constructed a three - channel model which gives a reasonable description of the s - wave @xmath0 scattering in the 1.0 - 1.7 gev region .",
    "this has been accomplished by requiring the s - matrix to have poles at the three known isoscalar 0@xmath5 resonances as well as realistic branch cuts at the @xmath56 and @xmath57 thresholds .",
    "multi - pion channels are described as effective @xmath2 and @xmath3 channels .",
    "the model can be used to predict the s - wave @xmath0 interaction in the 2 gev region which can play an important role in the study of the recently well measured @xmath58 process .",
