    "the interest in one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum systems with several interacting particles arguably began back in 1931 when bethe solved the famous heisenberg model of ferromagnetism @xcite , but it was only in the 1960s that people realized that the techniques invented by bethe could be used to solve a host of different many - body models @xcite .",
    "it was subsequently realized that many 1d systems have universal low - energy behaviour and can be described by the paradigmatic tomonaga - luttinger - liquid ( tll ) theory @xcite .",
    "this opened up the field of one - dimensional physics , which has remained a large subfield of condensed - matter physics ever since @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been a great revival of interest in 1d systems due to the realization of 1d quantum gases in highly controllable environments using cold atomic gases @xcite .",
    "this development implies that one may now experimentally realize 1d systems with bosons or fermions and explore the intricate nature of their quantum behaviour .",
    "a recent frontier is the realization of multi - component systems @xcite in order to study fundamental 1d effects such as spin - charge separation @xcite .",
    "while this effect is usually associated with spin 1/2 fermions , it turns out that it can also be explored in bose mixtures ( two - component bosonic systems ) where the phenomenon can be even richer as there can be interactions between the two components ( inter - species ) and also within each component separately ( intra - species ) @xcite .",
    "the latter is strongly suppressed for fermions due to the pauli principle . in the case where the intra- and inter - species interactions are identical it has been shown that a ferromagnetic ground state occurs @xcite . generalizing to the case of unequal intra- and inter - species interactions may be possible , but since the proofs and techniques rely on spin algebra and representation theory , they can not be used to obtain the full spatial structure of general systems and other approaches are therefore needed . here",
    "we consider the limit where the inter - species dominates the intra - species interactions .",
    "this regime has been explored in recent years for small systems using various few - body techniques @xcite and behaviour different from strongly interacting fermions or single - component bosons can be found already for three particles @xcite . from the many - body side ,",
    "the system is known to have spin excitations with quadratic dispersion , @xcite which can be shown to be a generic feature of the magnon excitations above a ferromagnetic ground state @xcite .",
    "this goes beyond the tll theory and it has been conjectured that a new universality class ( ferromagnetic liquid ) emerges in this regime @xcite .    here",
    "we provide a particularly clean realization of a ferromagnetic system confined in a harmonic trap . using numerical and newly developed analytical techniques we obtain and analyze the exact wave function .",
    "this allows us to explore the crossover between few- and many - body behaviour , and to demonstrate that the strongly interacting regime realizes a perfect ferromagnet in the ground state , while particular excited states will produce perfect antiferromagnetic order . in the extremely imbalanced system , with one strongly interacting impurity",
    ", we find both numerically and analytically that the impurity will always move to the edge of the system .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to fermionic systems where the impurity is mainly located at the center @xcite .",
    "our work provides a rare and explicit example of perfect ferro- or antiferromagnetism using the most fundamental knowledge of a quantum system as given by the full wave function .     and one @xmath0 particle as a function of interaction strength , @xmath1 , obtained by numerical calculations . in the limit @xmath2 ,",
    "the ground state becomes doubly degenerate and has half - integer energy .",
    "the contribution from center - of - mass motion has been removed .",
    "for visibility , we have removed states from the attractive side that diverge to large negative energies close to @xmath2 . ]",
    "our two - component bosonic system has @xmath3 particles split between @xmath4 and @xmath5 identical bosons of two different kinds .",
    "all @xmath6 particles have mass @xmath7 and move in the same external harmonic trapping potential with single - particle hamiltonian @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the momentum and position of either an @xmath11 or @xmath0 particle and @xmath12 is the common trap frequency .",
    "the trap provides a natural set of units for length , @xmath13 , and energy , @xmath14 , which we will use throughout ( here @xmath15 is planck s constant divided by @xmath16 ) .",
    "we assume short - range interactions between @xmath11 and @xmath0 particles that we model by a dirac delta - function parameterized by an interaction strength , @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath17 where @xmath10 and @xmath18 denote the coordinates of @xmath11 and @xmath0 particles , respectively .",
    "the intraspecies interaction strengths are assumed to be much smaller than @xmath1 and we will therefore neglect such terms . to access the quantum mechanical properties of our system",
    "we must solve the @xmath6-body schrdinger equation .",
    "this will be done using novel analytical tools and using exact diagonalization . in the latter case",
    "we have adapted an effective interaction approach that has recently been succesfully applied to fermions in harmonic traps @xcite ( see the methods section for further details ) .",
    "the analytical and numerical methods allow us to address up to ten particles , which is larger than most previous studies not based on stochastic or monte carlo techniques .",
    "the simplest non - trivial case is the three - body system which has two @xmath11 and one @xmath0 particle .",
    "the energy spectrum is shown in fig .  [ 2 + 1 ] as a function of @xmath1 . the most interesting feature to notice is the ground state behaviour as @xmath19 . here , an odd and an even state become",
    "degenerate at an energy of @xmath20 .",
    "this should be contrasted to the behaviour of single - component bosons or two - component fermions which will always have energies that are an integer times @xmath14 when @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , we notice how the two states that merge at @xmath21 become two excited state branches on the attractive side of the resonance but the even parity state remains the lower one .",
    "this is opposite to the behaviour of fermions @xcite where the hierarchy of states is inverted at @xmath21 .",
    "the ground state for large and negative @xmath1 is very different as it contains deeply bound molecules , which we will not consider further .",
    "the fractional energies in the spectrum can be explained by a schematic three - body model and in stochastic variational calculations @xcite .",
    "this provides a hint that larger systems could also display fractional energy states in the strongly interacting limit and begs the question as to what spatial configurations such states correspond to .",
    "we will now show that the fractional energy states are generic for strongly interacting two - component bosons in 1d and , importantly , for the ground state they realize perfect ferromagnetic behaviour irrespective of whether the system is balanced ( @xmath22 ) or not .",
    "the term perfect ferromagnetic behaviour implies that we have a full spatial separation of the two components in the exact ground state wave function of the system , i.e. the probability to find only @xmath11 on one side and only @xmath0 on the other side of the system is not just dominant , it is exactly _",
    "unity_. the ground state has only a single domain wall at which an @xmath11 and a @xmath0 particle are neighbours . as a consequence ,",
    "imagine that you detect an @xmath11 particle on the left ( right ) side of the system , then you can immediately conclude that all the @xmath0 particles reside to the right ( left ) of this @xmath11 particle .",
    "we first consider a four - body system that has two @xmath11 and two @xmath0 particles .",
    "the energy spectrum for @xmath23 is shown in fig .",
    "[ 2 + 2]*a * ) .",
    "a striking feature is the two - fold degenerate ground state for @xmath2 that has a non - integer energy similar to the three - body problem . in this strongly repulsive limit",
    ", the system realizes a perfect spatially ferromagnetic quantum state as we will now demonstrate analytically .",
    "first we note that the center - of - mass motion of the four - body system can be separated and thus ignored .",
    "this leaves three jacobi coordinates to describe the system .",
    "the details of these reductions can be found in the methods section below . in fig .",
    "[ 2 + 2]*b * ) we show the space of the jacobi coordinates and highlight all the planes at which an @xmath24 ( solid planes ) , an @xmath25 or a @xmath26 ( checkerboard planes ) pair of particles overlap .",
    "the main observation is that as @xmath2 , the wave function must vanish on all the solid planes in fig .",
    "[ 2 + 2]*b * ) and we arrive at the disconnected regions shown with different colours .",
    "the particles become effectively impenetrable and we may characterize the wave function by specifying the amplitudes of all possible spatial configurations of the four particles .",
    "these regions correspond to specific orderings on a line of the four particles .",
    "in particular , the large ( red ) region dominating the figure corresponds to spatial configurations @xmath27 or @xmath28 .",
    "the green region occupies half the spatial volume of the red and corresponds to @xmath29 or @xmath30 , while the yellow region has one - fourth the volume of the red region and corresponds to @xmath31 or @xmath32 configurations .",
    "a wave function that vanishes on all @xmath24 interfaces may now be constructed in each of these regions .",
    "however , it is immediately clear that it will have lower energy when it can spread over a larger volume .",
    "we thus conclude that the doubly degenerate ground state at @xmath2 has the structure @xmath33 ( taking into account the parity invariance of the hamiltonian ) .    as discussed in the methods section",
    ", one may solve a simple wave equation in the red region and obtain the ground state energy to arbitrary precision .",
    "the triangles at the @xmath21 line in fig .",
    "[ 2 + 2]*a * ) show the energies obtained in this manner .",
    "we reproduce both the ground state and a set of excited states .",
    "all of these have fractional energies and all of them are perfectly ferromagnetically ordered .",
    "the remaning states of the spectrum can be obtained by solving in the other regions of fig .",
    "[ 2 + 2]*b * ) .",
    "note that states with amplitude exclusively in the yellow regions are perfectly spatial antiferromagnetic , @xmath34 , and have energies @xmath35 @xmath14 with integer @xmath36 .",
    "they are the only parts of the spectrum which can be constructed by starting from identical fermions using girardeau s mapping techniques @xcite .",
    "the arguments presented here are neither restricted to @xmath37 nor to a harmonic trapping potential and hold for any @xmath6 and any shape of the external confinement .",
    "they hinge only on the fact that the @xmath27 or @xmath28 configurations occupy the largest volume .",
    "for instance , for @xmath27 the four regions @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are adjacent regions and are connected by bose symmetry of each component , thus they make up the connected upper red region ( @xmath42 ) of the coordinate space in fig .",
    "[ 2 + 2]*b * ) . for @xmath29",
    "one finds that only @xmath43 and @xmath44 are adjacent and connected .",
    "this implies that the volume for @xmath29 is half as large .     and different values of @xmath1 .",

    "larger systems may in principle be handled in similar fashion by solving wave equations with proper boundary conditions and obtaining the fractional energies in the limit @xmath2 .",
    "however , the increase in dimension of the problem makes this very difficult in practice . in order to further demonstrate that balanced systems have perfect ferromagnetic ground states irrespective of particle number ,",
    "we have numerically computed the ground state densities for systems with @xmath51 as shown in fig .",

    "evidence of the separation of @xmath11 and @xmath0 can be seen in the total density already in fig .",

    "[ bdens]*c * ) and beautifully confirm our expectations .",
    "as the ground state for @xmath2 is spatially separated , one may speculate that it can be understood physically as two ideal bose gases or condensates sitting on either side of the system even in this strongly interacting limit . in fig .",

    "the convergence of the results toward the @xmath49 case indicates that the system does behave as two ideal bose gases as the particle number grows . in the limit @xmath50",
    ", we would expect the overlap of the two gases to vanish as the energy cost of overlap goes to infinity .",
    "we therefore expect that the occupied mode in this large system limit is the first excited state of the harmonic trap which vanishes at the center .",

    "as in the balanced case above , we find a perfectly separated ground state behaviour .",
    "for instance , if we locate the single @xmath11 particle on one side of the trap , we would thus immediately know that all the @xmath0 particles reside on the other side , and vice versa .",

    "the energy per particle goes to @xmath67 , which implies a single - mode condensate that is becoming macroscopically occupied ( see methods section for details ) .",
    "the relative deviation between numerical and analytical energies is below three percent for @xmath68 .",

    "a simple physical picture can be given in terms of domain walls , i.e. points at which the two components interface .",
    "the system tends to minimize the number of domain walls and this principle can be used to understand the ferromagnetic ground state and predict the ordering in energy of other configurations . in the paradigmatic two - component ( spin 1/2 ) fermi system , the ground state is never purely ferro- or antiferromagnetic for strong interactions @xcite , and bose",
    "mixtures therefore provide a unique set of quantum ground states for exploring and exploiting magnetic behaviour .",
    "the description of these systems clearly goes beyond the famous bose - fermi mappings @xcite and we provide not only numerical but also new analytical tools to fill this gap .",
    "importantly , we demonstrate that the crossover from few- to many - body physics can be studied already at the level of ten particles .",

    "the model space truncation is defined by an upper limit of the total energy .    instead of the bare zero - range interaction in , we consider an effective two - body interaction in order to speed up the convergence of the eigenstates with respect to the size of the many - body basis .",
    "the effective potential is constructed in a truncated two - body space , and is designed such that its solutions correspond to exact two - body solutions given by the busch formula  @xcite . as explained in detail in refs .",
    ", this is achieved using a unitary transformation that involves the lowest eigensolutions given by the busch formula . by construction",
    ", this unitary transformation approach will reproduce exact bare hamiltonian results for the many - body system ( both energy spectrum and wave functions ) in the limit of infinite model space .",
    "the excellent convergence property of this effective - interaction approach was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite and is key to the quality of our numerical results and to our conclusions . in the construction of the effective interactions we benefit from having access to the exact two - body solutions for short - range interactions in harmonic traps .",

    "<S> strongly interacting one - dimensional quantum systems often behave in a manner that is distinctly different from their higher - dimensional counterparts . when a particle attempts to move in a one - dimensional environment it will unavoidably have to interact and push other particles in order to execute a pattern of motion , irrespective of whether the particles are fermions or bosons . </S>",
    "<S> a present frontier in both theory and experiment are mixed systems of different species and/or particles with multiple internal degrees of freedom . here </S>",
    "<S> we consider trapped two - component bosons with short - range inter - species interactions much larger than their intra - species interactions and show that they have novel energetic and magnetic properties . in the strongly interacting regime , these systems have energies that are fractions of the basic harmonic oscillator trap quantum and have spatially separated ground states with manifestly ferromagnetic wave functions . furthermore , we predict excited states that have perfect antiferromagnetic ordering . </S>",
