    "although it was originally an attempt to compute the high - energy asymptotics of qcd and to justify regge theory , it turned out to be an evolution equation in @xmath2 for the so - called unintegrated parton distributions ( used in @xmath4-factorization @xcite to compute inclusive particle production at scale @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) , which behave @xmath7 .",

    "parton densities become high .",
    "then the idea of saturation of parton densities ( see @xcite ) becomes unavoidable , as parton fusion balances parton splitting if @xmath11 .",
    "it can be alternatively formulated in terms of the @xmath12-matrix at fixed impact parameter @xmath13 becoming black , @xmath14 .",
    "saturation constitutes a new regime of qcd , in which old ideas ( pomeron interaction , multiple scattering , coherence arguments,@xmath15 ) are expressed in a new , qcd language .",
    "it also offers a link between small @xmath0 physics and heavy ion collisions : in nuclear collisions at high energies large partonic densities are expected , both due to the high energy and to the @xmath16-enhancement coming from the nuclear size .",
    "the understanding of the initial state in a nuclear collision is crucial to get a coherent picture of the eventual thermalization of the system and creation of quark gluon plasma .",
    "our present understanding of the different regimes of qcd is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . at low @xmath17",
    "we have the confinement region . at large @xmath17 and",
    "not too high @xmath2 we are in the low - density region , where the usual evolution equations can be used : bfkl in @xmath18 and dglap in @xmath19 . for both large @xmath18 and @xmath19",
    "we are in the dll regime , where a first non - linear correction has been proposed , the glrmq equations @xcite .",
    "finally in the high - density regime , separated from the low - density one by a line which defines the saturation scale @xmath20 , a non - linear generalization of bfkl is the balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) equation @xcite .",
    "i will present in the next section the phenomenological models implementing saturation and our current theoretical understanding of this new regime . in section 3",
    "i will analyze properties of the solutions of the bk equations , and in section 4 the application of saturation ideas to high - energy nuclear collisions , presently studied at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at bnl .",

    "] , non - linear equations in the collinear approach , relations with other realizations of collectivity or many examples of observables analyzed , will not be discussed ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the most compelling indirect evidence of saturation comes from the phenomenological success of some models containing saturation ideas when confronted to hera data .",
    "the most commonly used is the gbw model @xcite .",
    "it is formulated within the color dipole model , in which the interaction of the virtual photon with the hadron or nucleus is described as a convolution of the probability that the photon fluctuates into a @xmath22 pair of fixed transverse size @xmath23 with the dipole - hadron cross section , @xmath24 , becomes at small @xmath0 larger than the hadron size , so its interaction is coherent . ] . for the latter",

    "mb , @xmath29 and @xmath9 , this model gives a reasonable description of all hera data on @xmath30 of the proton for @xmath31 ( @xmath32 gev@xmath33 ) .",
    "it has been extended to included dglap evolution and to describe diffraction at hera @xcite , and is widely used for phenomenology @xcite .",

    "after earlier studies @xcite , a milestone in the theoretical development of saturation ideas in qcd was the mv model @xcite .",
    "this model treats classical radiation from color sources moving ultrarelativistically through a large nucleus . with a form for the color correlators in the target and taking into account the non - abelian gluon interaction",
    ", it gives an explicit form for the nuclear gluon distribution in the transverse phase space , @xmath36}/4}].\\ ] ]    later on , gluon radiation ( quantum evolution ) of color sources was introduced , leading to a renormalization group - type equation ( the so - called color glass condensate @xcite ) .",
    "the rescattering of the projectile in the nucleus is described through wilson lines whose average on target configurations gives the @xmath12-matrix .",
    "the key point is that the fields ( occupation numbers ) become large ( @xmath37 ) but the coupling is small , so classical arguments and perturbative methods are applicable .",
    "a hierarchy of coupled equations for @xmath38-gluon correlators appears @xcite .",
    "in the framework outlined in the previous section , the bk equation @xcite is the evolution equation in @xmath2 for the 2-gluon correlator , decoupled from the hierarchy in the @xmath39 limit ( and with correlations neglected @xcite ) limit @xcite . ] . as bfkl",
    ", it is infrared stable , mixes all twists and @xmath10 is fixed . for @xmath40 given by a target average of the wilson lines of a @xmath41 and a @xmath42 located at transverse positions @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively , it reads @xmath45 , \\label{eq3}\\ ] ] with @xmath46 . taking into account just the linear terms this equation reduces to bfkl . in the dll limit , glrmq",

    "its analytical solutions are unknown .",
    "only some theoretical estimates exist @xcite .",
    "so , numerical methods have been developed .",
    "these numerical methods usually deal with the situation @xmath47 , dependence has also been studied numerically @xcite and turns out to be of great importance to compute the behavior of the total cross section at very high energies in this approach . ] either in position space @xcite or in momentum space @xcite ( in this latter case we define @xmath48 ) . using different techniques two very interesting properties of the solutions",
    "have been found .",
    "first , function @xmath49 gets a constant shape in @xmath50 at large @xmath51 , moving to the right with constant velocity @xcite .",
    "second , identifying the position of the maximum of @xmath52 with the saturation scale @xmath53 , the solutions show scaling , i.e. @xmath54 @xcite ( linked to that in @xmath55 discussed in the previous section , sometimes called geometrical scaling ) .",
    "these two features are illustrated in fig .",
    "the velocity of the solution has been computed , @xmath56 , with @xmath57 @xcite . as a consequence of these features ,",
    "the contribution from the low-@xmath58 region is reduced with increasing @xmath51 , thus offering a possibility to avoid the infrared problem of bfkl .",
    "these features are independent of the initial condition ( mv @xcite , bfkl - like @xcite , dglap - like @xcite , gaussian @xcite or gbw @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the shape of the solutions above @xmath53 has been examined @xcite , favoring a log - corrected shape @xcite over a pure power in @xmath58 @xcite .    -0.3",
    "cm    -0.4 cm    -0.5 cm",
    "for midrapidity at @xmath59 gev , @xmath60 means @xmath61 , so @xmath0 at rhic may well be too high to apply safely saturation ideas . assuming that @xmath0 is small enough , which we will do in the following , multiplicities and their evolution with centrality and pseudorapidity can be computed in saturation , usually within a factorized approach @xmath62 with @xmath63 the saturation momentum of hadrons @xmath64 and @xmath65 at some given centrality , and @xmath66 the transverse momentum .",
    "it is still unclear to what extent this factorized ansatz is exact and which one is the function @xmath67 which should be introduced into this equation @xcite ; other approaches in the semiclassical framework have also been essayed @xcite . with some ansatz for @xmath67 ,",
    "a simple formula is derived @xcite , @xmath68}$ ] , @xmath69 , @xmath9 ( gbw model ) .",
    "this formula successfully reproduces multiplicities , their evolution with centrality and pseudorapidity distributions at rhic .",
    "see that the deviation from the scaling with the number of participants @xmath70 is due just to the log ( coming from a factor @xmath71 ) , at variance with what is found in other approaches @xcite .",
    "so the question arises whether rhic data can be explained by initial state effects @xcite .      the transverse momentum distribution of partons and particles is expected to be suppressed by the presence of a medium , the so - called jet quenching .",
    "this is usually quantified through the ratios @xmath72 normalized in this way , this ratio goes to 1 at large @xmath66 according to the usual qcd factorization expectation , with @xmath73 the number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "indeed , such suppression has been observed in auau collisions at rhic @xcite .",
    "contrary to the jet quenching interpretation , it has been argued in @xcite that such suppression can be explained by initial state , saturation effects , so it should also be present in dau collisions .",
    "these collisions have been studied at rhic and an enhancement has been found @xcite , the so - called cronin effect measured long ago .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that the depletion in auau is due to final state effects .",
    "let us examine in more detail the result in @xcite .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the behavior of @xmath67 above @xmath53 is crucial to get either suppression or enhancement in the ratios ( [ ratios ] ) .",
    "the naive expectation is that saturation effects are important only for @xmath74 .",
    "still , the behavior of @xmath67 in the region @xmath75 is driven by evolution @xcite .",
    "non - evolved forms lead generally to enhancement @xcite . on the contrary , in @xcite a form which contains evolution features",
    "@xcite has been used .",
    "after numerical studies @xcite , it has become clear @xcite that quantum evolution does not generate enhancement but very efficiently erases any that may be present in the initial conditions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "then a prediction is that the cronin effect will disappear at higher energies ( lhc ) or for forward rapidities in pa , corresponding to smaller @xmath0 in the nucleus .",
    "preliminary brahms data @xcite in dau collisions at @xmath76 suggest such effect .",
    "nevertheless , other effects like running coupling @xcite may be important for a quantitative comparison .",
    "summarizing , the concept of saturation in small @xmath0 physics has been introduced .",
    "some features of the solutions of the non - linear bk equation which arises in this context , have been analyzed .",
    "the relevance of saturation for the initial stage of a nuclear collision has been discussed .",
    "assuming that @xmath0 at rhic is small enough to apply saturation ideas , the importance of non - linear small @xmath0 evolution for the interpretation of enhancement or suppression of the @xmath66 distributions measured there has been shown .",
