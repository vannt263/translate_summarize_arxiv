    "a matroid captures the notion of a discrete collection of points in space .",
    "sometimes these points can be assigned coordinates in a consistent way , and sometimes they can not .",
    "the problem of characterising when a matroid is _ representable _ has been the prime motivating force in matroid research since whitney s founding paper @xcite .",
    "plenty of effort has been invested in characterising matroid representability via excluded minors .",
    "less attention has been paid to the prospect of characterisating representability via axioms .",
    "perhaps this is because of vmos s well - known article @xcite , which has been interpreted as stating that no such characterisation is possible ( see @xcite ) . in @xcite , we pointed out that the possibility of characterising representable matroids in the language of whitney s axioms was still open ; that , in other words , it was still not proved that  the missing axiom of matroid theory is lost forever \" , _ contra _ vmos s title .",
    "we conjectured that in fact there was no such characterisation , and we made some partial progress towards resolving the conjecture by showing that it was impossible to characterise the class of representable matroids , or the class of matroids representable over an infinite field , using a logical language based on the rank function .",
    "however , that language imposed quite strong constraints on the form of quantification . in this article , we present a language with no such constraints , and we prove that it is impossible to characterise representability , or representability over an infinite field , in this more natural language .",
    "the language that we develop is a form of monadic second - order logic , @xmath0 . as we show in",
    ", @xmath0  is expressive enough to state the matroid axioms , and to state when a matroid contains an isomorphic copy of a fixed minor .",
    "this means that any minor - closed class of matroids can be characterised with a sentence in @xmath0 , as long as it has a finite number of excluded minors .",
    "in particular , since rota s conjecture has been positively resolved by geelen , gerards , and whittle ( see @xcite ) , it follows that the class of @xmath2-representable matroids can be characterised by a sentence in @xmath0 , whenever @xmath2 is a finite field .",
    "our main results show that this is not the case for the class of matroids that are representable over at least one field , nor for the class of @xmath1-representable matroids , when @xmath1 is any infinite field .",

    "these theorems may seem stronger than those in @xcite , but in fact the results are independent of each other .",

    "we have a contradiction , since the first of these direct sums is a representable matroid , and the second is not .",
    "let @xmath5 be a positive integer .",
    "we say that matroids @xmath14 and @xmath15 are _ equivalent _ if , for any sentence @xmath3 with @xmath5 variables , and any matroid @xmath20 , either both @xmath21 and @xmath22 satisfy @xmath3 , or neither do .",

    "the resulting matroid is denoted @xmath41 . in the case that @xmath42 and @xmath43 , where the order of @xmath33 is greater than @xmath44 , then both @xmath14 and @xmath20 can be represented over @xmath1 , but @xmath41 can be represented over @xmath1 if and only if @xmath45 .",
    "this means that the following quickly leads to a proof of , with hoop matroids playing the same role that projective planes did in the proof of .",
