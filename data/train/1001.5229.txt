    "the method we used for mode degree @xmath0 discrimination has been already described and the results of its application to the main sequence stars presented in several papers .",
    "this method is very challenging , since it requires observations performed in at least three filters .",
    "moreover , time - series spectroscopy could also be employed . for this reason , the best objects to apply this method to are bright stars with relatively long periods and relatively high amplitudes , so they are accessible even with small size telescopes .",
    "it is possible then to achieve good sampling of the brightness changes to derive amplitudes and periods of the detected modes .",
    "although hot subdwarfs ( sdb ) are relatively faint objects , in 2004 independent photometric and spectroscopic observations of the brightest pulsating sdb star , balloon090910001 ( bal09 ) , allowed a successful application of the method @xcite .",
    "for the same star , but with high precision multicolor photometry , @xcite also derived good discrimination for a few modes with highest amplitudes . from these two papers",
    "we can draw one important conclusion . the method may give positive discrimination of the @xmath0 parameter either having high precision three ",
    "filter photometry , or a few ( at least two ) of low precision photometry supported by spectroscopy . encouraged by the successful application of the method for bal09 we decided to try with another pulsating subdwarf b star , qqvir .",
    "the main goal of performing another observation of qqvir was to decide which ( or if any ) value of the @xmath0 parameter for the dominant mode , obtained in previous works , is the correct one .",
    "@xcite analyzed spectroscopic data and stated that the main mode is consistent with @xmath0=0 .",
    "quite interestingly , @xcite , based on photometry data only , derived @xmath0=2 from frequency matching .",
    "the @xcite result is even more surprising as it indicates unusually high intrinsic amplitude of the mode with @xmath0=2 mode .",
    "it is interesting then to use both kinds of data , photometry and spectroscopy , to constrain the value of the mode degree for the dominant mode in qqvir and if possible , either to confirm one of the already obtained values or to exclude both of them .",
    "from the previous observations we knew that the pulsational period of the dominant mode is relatively short ( @xmath12min . ) . along with a low brightness ( @xmath113.5mag in the v filter ) , data required for the method were not easy to obtain , particularly with small size telescopes .",
    "for this reason , we performed only one filter photometry on each telescope with the exposure time short enough to get appropriate sampling but not necessarily long enough to have high precision data .",
    "details on the observations are presented in table[tab1 ] , while all photometry gathered in this project is plotted in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "this figure also includes spectroscopic data which have been used in this method .",
    "details on spectroscopy can be found in the paper by @xcite in this volume .",
    "data in different filters were taken at different telescopes .",
    "this is the reason why there are not the same number of nights for all filters . with respect to the spectrum of the star and spectral response of the ccd we used",
    ", the highest signal has been obtained in the v filter .",
    "these data have been used for precise frequency determination of the dominant mode .",
    "that was also the reason why observations in the v filter have been performed for the longest time from the sites with easy access , like : suhora , mercator and baker .",
    "in addition to the v filter , data in the u filter were taken at loiano and nordic optical telescope ( not ) during three nights in total .",
    "fortunately , the dominant mode is clearly resolved with only one night of data .",
    "sometime later , it turned out that , quite luckily , almost at the same time as our campaign , absolutely independent data in b filter were taken during the course of a different project .",
    "that enables us to use three filter data .",
    "the b filter data were not crucial , but this method of mode discrimination improves with the number of filters used .",
    "although the observations in different filters were not conducted simultaneously , we can use published results to see if the amplitude of the dominant frequency changes with time .",
    "results obtained by @xcite and @xcite have radial velocity and b filter amplitudes consistent with ours .",
    "those observations were performed independently and at differing times during 2003 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the amplitudes are not changing significantly and remain stable to within the errors .",
    "moreover , results from the multisite campaign of @xcite indicate there are no nearby frequencies to the dominant one , even at very low amplitudes .",
    "this suggests that our data do not suffer from amplitude variability or the effects of nearby frequencies .",
    ".observational log for qqvir data .",
    "all data were taken in 2008 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab2 ]",
    "a prewhitening procedure was applied to derive frequencies , amplitudes and phases of the pulsation modes .",
    "first , we assumed that amplitudes can vary linearly . as it turned out , the change was insignificant ( within the errors ) and we have decided to assume constant amplitude and redid the prewhitening process .",
    "phases were calculated relative to epoch 2454552.0 which was chosen arbitrarily .",
    "amplitudes and phases for the dominant mode at frequency 7.2554776 @xmath2 0.0000004mhz ( derived from v filter data ) derived from the data in u b v filters , as well as from the radial velocity curve are presented in table[tab2 ] . a raw amplitude spectrum calculated from the data in v filter",
    "is shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "it has been limited to the region where the signal appeared , which is 69mhz .",
    "the amplitude spectra calculated from other filters looks similar , however the noise level and resolution is worse as less data were obtained . since the main aim of this work is to derive the most likely value of the dominant mode , the other modes are not included in table[tab2 ] .",
    "nevertheless , during the prewhitening process they were taken into account to check if their removal has any influence on the frequency and/or amplitude of the mode in question .",
    "if so , they were included in the solution .",
    "having derived frequencies , amplitudes and phases we could apply the method to discriminate @xmath0 parameters for the dominant modes detected both in the radial - velocity and brightness variations .",
    "discrimination of @xmath0 , does not depend on the observations alone .",
    "it also depends on the model parameters , in particular effective temperature , surface gravity , flux and limb darkening derivatives over effective temperature and surface gravity . for qqvir we assumed the effective temperature and surface gravity derived by @xcite , t@xmath3 = 34800  k , @xmath4 = 5.81  dex .",
    "then we needed to calculate flux distributions in the range between 300 and 700  nm for a grid of models with t@xmath3 ranging from 32500 to 37500  k and @xmath4 , from 5.5 to 6.0  dex . to do this",
    ", we used a grid of models prepared for the interested range in t@xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the resulting flux distributions were multiplied by transmission functions of the filters to get integrated fluxes in the three photometric bands ",
    "@xmath5  that we used .    for the same grid of models",
    ", we also calculated the specific intensities as a function of @xmath6 = @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the angle between the line of sight and normal to the stellar surface in a given point of the stellar disc .",
    "using these intensities , the limb darkening law was derived fitting the coefficients @xmath9 and @xmath10 of a function @xmath11 \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] which was found to reproduce the calculated changes of @xmath12 best .",
    "this was done for different combinations of input parameters of the model , thus allowing the calculation of the necessary derivatives .",
    "a disadvantage of the method we applied for mode degree discrimination is that we can not derive a value of @xmath0 in a direct way .",
    "we must use an iterative process and employ a merit function to discriminate which mode is the most probable .",
    "the minimum of the function ( if it exists ) indicates the possible value . in this study",
    "we applied this method to discriminate between divergent solutions for the main frequency of qqvir .",
    "results of our calculation are shown in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "the results clearly show that the best fit was obtained for @xmath130",
    ". however , the minimum of the merit function is not very deep and can not exclude @xmath0=1 and @xmath0=2 .",
    "it can , however , , exclude @xmath132 .",
    "this does not help to achieve the main goal of unique mode identification , but is consistent with previous work . in the case of bal09 , @xcite excluded any @xmath0 value if the @xmath14 function was at least 3 times higher than the smallest value of this function .",
    "if we follow this rule we can also exclude the @xmath152 value . on the other hand , we can use the probability q that the merit function for the correct model will exceed a given value by chance .",
    "the q values for the @xmath0=0 , 1 and 2 are 0.7 , 0.4 , 0.13 , respectively . in this case",
    "none of the first three @xmath0 s can be excluded .",
    "however the chance that @xmath0=0 is wrong is more than 5 times smaller than for @xmath0=2 .",
