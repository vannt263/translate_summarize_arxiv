    "in modelling of high intensity beams by particle - in - cell ( pic ) computer simulation it is of importance to understand whether any observed emittance growth or beam loss is caused by real physical processes , or by non - physical processes like numerical discretisation and grid effects from the poisson solver , which can be also seen as pseudo - collisions with the grid charge distribution .",
    "our emphasis is on the numerical noise generated by the discreteness of the spatial grid used for the poisson solver and the finite number of particles .",
    "we focus on beam parameters typical for high intensity linear accelerators , but our findings can also be extended to circular accelerators with very different ratio of transverse to longitudinal parameters .",
    "it is commonly accepted that real physical processes leading to amplitude and emittance growth can be initial mismatch ; mismatch at structure transitions ; errors ; external or internal resonances ; but also the fact that with space charge strictly periodic stationary distribution functions are not explicitly known in 3d ( for a detailed discussion see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in storage rings intra - beam scattering",
    "is often observed as another kind of real physical process , which leads to a total emittance growth under certain circumstances . numerical noise ,",
    "on the other hand , can have a similar effect on the beam as real intra - beam scattering .",
    "it is one of the challenges of high intensity beam simulation to be able to distinguish between physical and numerical growth effects . towards this end",
    "an in - depth understanding and parametrisation of numerical noise is crucial .",
    "collision or noise effects can , in principle , be associated with entropy growth .",
    "the concept of entropy in accelerator beams was first discussed in general terms by lawson et al .",
    "@xcite . later on the fokker - planck equation - see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion of its applicability to intra - beam scattering - was employed to analyse mismatch and turbulent heating of a sheet beam by bohn  @xcite .",
    "a significant step ahead in this direction has been the noise and entropy growth model by struckmeier  @xcite , which provides a useful theoretical framework based on second order moments of the vlasov - fokker - planck equation .",
    "it assumes collisional behaviour and temperature anisotropy to drive 6d rms emittance growth , which is used to explain rms entropy growth .",
    "evidence of such an emittance growth by grid and particle number related `` spurious collisions '' in a linac environment - using the picnic space charge routine within the parmila code - was given in ref .",
    "the present computational study makes use of the analytical framework by struckmeier , examines its validity for 3d bunched beams under space charge conditions typical for high intensity proton or ion linear accelerators , and presents different parametric dependencies to serve as basis for optimization . for our study",
    "we use the tracewin pic code  @xcite developed primarily for linear accelerators .",
    "it also employs the picnic space charge routine with an @xmath0 as well as an @xmath1 option . detailed comparison with results from other codes or simulation codes more suitable for circular accelerators",
    "is left to future work .",
    "it is worth reminding the fact that in analytical descriptions of high intensity beam phenomena it is generally assumed that the flow of particles in 6d phase space can be described by a hamiltonian with - in general - time - dependent external forces and a time - dependent self - consistent space charge potential .",
    "liouville s theorem applies , which implies that the volume of a phase space element occupied by particles remains invariant in time . in such a system",
    "there is no entropy growth , if infinite phase space resolution is assumed and the boltzmann entropy as logarithm of probabilities in 6d or @xmath2 space is evaluated accordingly .",
    "the same applies to a hamiltonian flow in the 6n - dimensional phase space ( @xmath3 space ) , which includes systems with coulomb collisions .",
    "growth of the gibbs entropy ( logarithm of probabilities in @xmath3 space ) requires introduction of a `` coarse - grained '' phase space as opposed to the `` fine - grained '' infinite resolution phase space , which of course breaks the hamiltonian nature of the flow .",
    "there is a certain analogy between coarse - graining in @xmath3 space and the pic - code technique of distributing particles on a 3d grid to solve poisson s equation .",
    "the latter also breaks the hamiltonian nature of the flow in 6d phase space and is a source of entropy growth . under certain circumstances",
    "the interaction with this grid can be also looked at as `` collision '' with the grid charge distribution .",
    "the idea of a probability based approach to entropy by using the logarithm of the rms emittance was introduced by lawson et al .",
    "@xcite . for a time - independent kapchinskij - vladimirskij distribution in 4d phase space",
    "they thus obtained @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the boltzmann constant .    an important step towards dynamically evolving distributions",
    "has been the approach by struckmeier  @xcite .",
    "he demonstrated that the rms - second order moments - approach originally introduced by sacherer  @xcite to derive envelope equations , and later generalized to include the field energy in 6d ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , can be extended to the full vlasov - fokker - planck equation .",
    "the thus obtained equation applies to the product of the three rms emittances , which can be understood as a six - dimensional rms emittance , @xmath6 , hence @xmath7 where @xmath8 measures the distance and @xmath9 , with @xmath10 the dynamical friction coefficient , which is proportional to the coulomb logarithm .",
    "the @xmath11 are rms based `` temperature ratios '' or ratios of intrinsic spreads of velocities given here in non - relativistic approximation : @xmath12 for upright ellipses we simply have the familiar rms expressions @xmath13 and similar for the remaining ratios .",
    "some caution is necessary when using a concept like `` temperature '' . strictly speaking",
    ", it can not be defined properly for our beams , which are not in an equilibrium state . in the above model the concept of locally near - isotropic temperatures",
    "is formally adopted as basis for the validity of the einstein relation connecting isotropic diffusion and friction coefficients , which is only valid for not too large deviation from thermal equilibrium .",
    "it is important to note that eq .",
    "[ emit - evol ] suggests a separation of a `` friction term '' ( given by @xmath14 ) and a `` temperature anisotropy term '' @xmath15 defined by the bracket on the r.h.s .",
    "[ emit - evol ] . for the present study",
    "we shall not be concerned further about a more rigorous justification of @xmath14 , which is left to a forthcoming study .",
    "instead , we adopt a phenomenological approach with the goal to demonstrate that this separation is a practical ansatz .",
    "the details of the numerical scheme and of the coulomb logarithm are assumed to enter into the coefficient @xmath14 ) , which is separated from the `` driving '' anisotropy term .",
    "note that - as one may expect from extended plasmas - no growth of the rms emittance is predicted from eq .",
    "[ emit - evol ] , if all temperatures are identical everywhere and the r.h.s . vanishes .",
    "this issue will be examined and discussed further below .    as the r.h.s .",
    "[ emit - evol ] is either zero or positive , @xmath16 can not decrease . noting that the probability of decoupled events is the product of individual probabilities and that entropy should be an `` extensive '' ( i.e. additive ) quantity , it is justified to relate this logarithm to the entropy in an rms sense analogous to the static kv - case in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath17 in the remainder of this work growth of @xmath18 is thus used as a synonym to entropy growth .",
    "it is , however , necessary to apply some caution here . an entropy definition based on rms quantities",
    "can not be applied to collective or resonant processes beyond second order , which may also cause growth of rms emittances , but at the same time a decrease of @xmath19 .",
    "this will be discussed in more detail in the following section .",
    "we employ the tracewin code  @xcite with a bunched beam , and in all examples of this section a periodic lattice with thin solenoid lenses and thin rf gaps at the same location . due to the rotational symmetry",
    "the @xmath0 poisson solver option of tracewin / picnic is sufficient .",
    "it is characterized by the number @xmath20 of radial cells from the origin to @xmath21 ; and @xmath22 as radial cells from @xmath23 to @xmath24 . for these maximum grid extent values",
    "we have assumed throughout the values 3@xmath25 , where @xmath25 is the rms size in each direction . beyond the grid limits picnic determines fields analytically assuming a gaussian density distribution of the same rms sizes .",
    "typical matched periodic envelopes over 5 cells - assuming a length of 1 m per cell - for a spherical ( breathing ) bunch with equal emittances in @xmath26 and @xmath27 are shown in fig .",
    "[ env ] . in all",
    "cases - unless mentioned otherwise - we set the option `` steps of calculation '' to 20/10 in tracewin , which implies 20 lattice calculations and 10 space charge steps per meter of drift space , in addition to one lattice calculation and one space charge step per solenoid . due to a rounding up algorithm",
    "this amounts to 14 space charge steps per lattice cell , which is found as sufficient . as starting distribution function",
    "we employ either the tracewin standard option `` 6d - ellipsoid '' ( randomly generated in the six - dimensional phase space ellipsoid with parabolic density profiles ) or the option `` gaussian '' ( parmila type 36 ) .          as mentioned above the validity of the rms entropy evolution",
    "is limited to incoherent noise effects .",
    "a distinction between essentially three regimes is recognized in fig .",
    "[ regimes ] , where the noise effect is enhanced by choosing a particle number as low as 1000 .",
    "an initial anisotropy with @xmath28 is assumed for a zero current phase advance @xmath27 , which results in space charge depressed tunes of @xmath29 .",

    "* coherent regime : * it is noted that in less than 20 cells a partial exchange occurs between transverse and longitudinal emittances .",
    "this is caused by the coherent space charge driven fourth order resonance with a stop - band around @xmath31 as shown in the stability chart of fig .",
    "[ regimes ] ( details see ref .",
    "the selfconsistently calculated tune foot print ( evolving from larger to smaller values of @xmath32 due to the dynamically changing emittances ) indicates the rapid initial changes of the tune ratio over the first few cells . during this resonant phase",
    "there is a steep increase of @xmath18 , followed by pronounced oscillations , and @xmath18 can not be interpreted as entropy .",
    "this is consistent with the observation that the underlying dynamics takes place beyond second order .",
    "note that the only partial approach to equipartition in this regime is related to the starting tune ratio at the right edge of the stop - band in fig .",
    "[ regimes ] .",
    "* anisotropy induced noise : * the remaining anisotropy slowly vanishes in the subsequent _ noise and anisotropy _ driven regime , which gradually leads to equal emittances and tunes at about 500 m , where @xmath33 .",

    "[ emit - evol ] predicts no further emittance or entropy growth .",
    "* grid induced noise : * the continuing growth of @xmath18 beyond the point of equipartition is unexpected in the frame of eq .",
    "[ emit - evol ] .",
    "we assume this growth is caused by a violation of the assumption of a locally isotropic collision type diffusion process - the underlying assumption in the derivation of eq .",
    "[ emit - evol ] - in our periodic focussing system .",
    "it must be assumed that this violation is actually a combined effect of several mechanisms : * coulomb interaction is via charges deposited on the grid rather than direct particle - particle interaction ; the distribution of charges on a grid introduces a `` coarse - graining '' component , which is not subject to hamiltonian mechanics , hence liouville does nt apply and entropy may grow .",
    "* the periodic modulation of focusing introduces a `` coherent '' streaming against the grid - even in a fully isotropic situation . *",
    "the modulation of focussing is not slow compared with `` collision times '' .",

    "+ derivation of such a modified equation from first principles is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "instead , we take this phenomenological approach and present further support to it in the following sections .",
    "we first study the relative increase in @xmath39 over 1000 cells for a strictly spherical bunch with gaussian distribution function , @xmath40 , @xmath27 and @xmath41 .",

    "<S> the numerical noise inherent to particle - in - cell simulation of 3d high intensity bunched beams is studied with the tracewin code and compared with the analytical model by struckmeier  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter assumes that entropy growth can be related to markov type stochastic processes due to temperature anisotropy and the artificial `` collisions '' caused by using macro - particles and calculating the space charge effect . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting noise can lead to growth of the six - dimensional rms emittance and a suitably defined rms entropy . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm the dependence of this growth on the bunch temperature anisotropy as predicted by struckmeier . </S>",
    "<S> however , we also find an apparently modified mechanism of noise generation by the non - liouvillean effect of the poisson solver grid , which exists in periodic focusing systems even in the complete absence of temperature anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> our findings are applicable in particular to high current linac simulation , where they can provide guidance to estimate noise effects and help finding an effective balance between the number of simulation particles and the grid resolution . </S>"
