    "inspiralling compact binaries are one of the most promising source of gravitational - wave signals for interferometric ground - based detectors such as ligo  @xcite and virgo  @xcite .",
    "the phase and amplitude of the signal strongly depend on the masses of the two compact objects , the spin effects ( neglected in this paper ) and eccentricity . however , it is known that most of the inspiralling compact binaries would have circularized by the time they enter the lower cut - off frequency of the detectors ( @xmath6 hereafter , which is about @xmath7 to @xmath8 ) .",
    "indeed , the eccentricity of an isolated compact binary evolving under the effect of gravitational radiation reaction is reduced by a factor of three when the semi - major axis is halved  @xcite .",
    "for instance , even though the orbital eccentricity of the hulse and taylor binary pulsar is @xmath9 ( from the last measurements published in  @xcite ) , it would decrease to @xmath10 by the time the orbital period of the binary reaches 0.02  s  @xcite . therefore , any isolated binary star formed by stellar evolution would have becomes circularized by the time its signal become measurable by ground - based detectors .",
    "nevertheless , in addition to the usual route to binary star formation , there exists a different formation scenario in densely populated regions ( e.g. , in globular clusters ) where binary - binary interactions can produce hierarchical triplets of black holes .",
    "the inner binaries of these triplets ( undergoing kozai oscillations ) can merge under gravitational radiation reaction with large eccentricity  @xcite .",
    "consequently , even at the lower cut - off frequency of ground - based detectors , there are compact binaries with significant eccentricity .",
    "as predicted in  @xcite , about 30% of the binaries will posses eccentricities larger than @xmath11 when their emitted gravitational - wave signals reach a frequency of @xmath12 .",
    "there is also semi - analytical description of the final stages of mergers of black - hole neutron - star(bhns ) binaries showing that they may transit to inspiralling compact binaries in eccentric orbits  @xcite .",
    "more recently , in  @xcite , the authors study the case of stellar mass black holes ( bhs ) that segregate and form a steep density cusp around supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei .",
    "they found that bh binaries that form this way in galactic nuclei have an expected rate of coalescence events detectable by advanced ligo about @xmath13 per year , depending on the initial mass function of stars in galactic nuclei and the mass of the massive bhs .",
    "the authors also claimed that such bh binaries have significant eccentricities as they enter the ligo band ( @xmath14 with @xmath15 ) , and hence they are distinguishable from other circularized binaries .",
    "they also show that mergers of eccentric binaries can be detected to larger distances and greater bh masses than circular mergers , up to ( @xmath16 ) .    despite",
    "the fact that binaries may have non - negligible eccentricities , current searches for inspiralling compact binaries neglects this parameter .",
    "for instance , the matched filtering technique that is deployed to analyze scientific runs of ligo data considers templates with circularized orbits only  @xcite . yet , matched filtering is sub - optimal if the template is not a faithful representation of the signal that is searched for . in a previous work , martel and poisson",
    "@xcite studied the loss of snr when signals from eccentric binaries are filtered with templates based on circularized binaries .",
    "they performed this study in the context of initial ligo .",
    "for instance , in the case of a @xmath17 binary with an initial eccentricity of 0.05 , they found that only a 2.4% loss of snr is expected . this result combined with the idea that eccentricities are small when a gravitational - wave signal enters a detector s band , led to searches where eccentricity is systematically neglected .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors considered a continuous space of templates to compute the loss of snr . in this paper",
    ", we consider a more realistic situation by using a discrete grid of templates , which is identical to the one used in ligo searches ( where eccentricity is neglected ) .",
    "we also extend our target sources not only to binary neutron star ( bns ) and low mass binary black hole ( bbh ) but also to large mass bbh and bhns .",
    "our goal is to provide a precise description of the loss of snr when waveforms from eccentric inspiralling compact binaries are searched with waveforms from circularized binaries .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we describe the relevant features of the inspiraling compact binaries .",
    "we also emphasize the differences between our waveforms and those obtained in  @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec : simulations ] , we describe the simulation protocol and present exhaustive results showing the loss of snr for different detectors , namely initial ligo , advanced ligo , einstein telescope and virgo detectors . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] , we discuss the implications of our results for ground - based detectors and future directions for this work .",
    "the evolution of the orbital elements of an eccentric binary was first calculated by peters and mathews  @xcite .",
    "the explicit expressions of the gravitational - wave signals were first derived in  @xcite , in the context of spacecraft doppler detection of gravitational waves .",
    "although eccentric waveforms have been derived to a higher post - newtonian order  @xcite , we restrict ourselves to the case of newtonian phase order .",
    "we use the same notation as in  @xcite . let us start from the orbital radius @xmath18 that is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the semi - latus rectum",
    ", @xmath21 is the total mass , @xmath22 is the eccentricity , and @xmath23 is the orbital phase . the semi - major axis is related to @xmath20 and @xmath22 by the relation @xmath24 note that the orbital period is defined by @xmath25    the decay of orbital elements @xmath20 and @xmath22 are calculated in the quadrupole approximation  @xcite . together with the orbital phase evolution ,",
    "we have three ordinary differential equations ( ode ) that can be used to describe the evolution of the system and form the starting point to determine the eccentric waveforms : @xmath26    @xmath27    @xmath28    in these equations @xmath29 is the reduced mass and , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the two component masses .",
    "we can convert eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dphidt ] ) , ( [ eq : dpdt ] ) , and ( [ eq : dedt ] ) into the same notation as in  @xcite , by replacing @xmath20 by @xmath32 using eq .",
    "( [ eq : a_functionof_p ] ) .    in order to compute eccentric waveforms",
    ", we need to solve the system of 3 odes as defined by eqs  ( [ eq : dphidt ] ) , ( [ eq : dpdt ] ) , and ( [ eq : dedt ] ) .",
    "the method employed is described in details in sec .",
    "[ sec : ode ] .",
    "once the evolution of the three parameters @xmath22 , @xmath20 and @xmath23 are known , we can generate the eccentric waveforms .",
    "the source and the gravitational wave detector are separated by a distance , @xmath33 .",
    "the detector is placed in a direction defined by the polar angles @xmath34 and @xmath35 relative to the cartesian frame ( following standard convention  @xcite ) .",
    "the unit vectors defined by @xmath36 and @xmath37 are chosen as polarization axes .",
    "the following equations are the two fundamental polarizations of the gravitational waves  @xcite : @xmath38(1+\\cos^{2}\\iota )   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & [ e\\cos(\\phi ) + e^2]\\sin^{2}\\iota \\bigg\\}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath39\\cos\\iota.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in sec .",
    "[ sec : simulations ] , we will see how @xmath34 and @xmath35 affect the waveform shape .",
    "it is important to notice that the signal can be decomposed into components that oscillate at once , twice and three times the orbital frequency .",
    "this effect is entirely related to the presence of eccentricity . indeed if we set @xmath40 , the remaining terms in eqs  ( [ eq : splus ] ) and ( [ eq : scross ] ) contain components that oscillate at twice the orbital frequency only .",
    "we also need the initial conditions for the semi - latus rectum , @xmath41 , the orbital phase , @xmath42 , and the eccentricity , @xmath43 .",
    "the initial conditions on @xmath43 and @xmath42 are set arbitrarily and are specified in sec.[sec : simulations ] .",
    "the remaining initial condition , @xmath41 , is derived from the initial eccentricity , @xmath43 . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : p ] ) , we have @xmath44 where @xmath45 depends on the lower cut - off frequency , @xmath6 , at which the signal enters a detector s sensitivity band .",
    "if we want the waveform to be valid from @xmath6 onwards , we must have the _",
    "third _ harmonic to start at @xmath6 .",
    "the consequence is that the _ first _ harmonic , which contributes to the third , must start at @xmath46 .",
    "so , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : p0 ] ) , we must set @xmath47 .",
    "finally , let us have a short digression about the effect of the parameter @xmath45 , which may lead to difficulties from the point of view of data analysis .",
    "indeed , if @xmath40 then the first and third harmonic contributions are null ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : splus ] ) and ( [ eq : scross ] ) ) . yet , with the definitions provided above , we can see that the second harmonic starts at @xmath48 . in the case of a non - eccentric waveform implementation ,",
    "starting the waveform at @xmath6 is sufficient .",
    "so , if we compare the duration of an eccentric waveform ( even when @xmath40 ) as defined in this paper with the duration of a purely non - eccentric waveform then the ratio of the durations of two waveforms is @xmath49 . for instance , a @xmath17 binary lasts 73 seconds if @xmath50  hz , and 465 seconds if @xmath51  hz .",
    "these durations have to be compared to a standard implementation where @xmath45 = @xmath6 : 25 and 158 seconds , respectively .",
    "dealing with such long waveforms may lead to technical issues from a computational point of view ( e.g. , memory allocation ) .      the main difficulty in generating eccentric waveforms from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : splus ] ) and ( [ eq : scross ] ) resides in the resolution of the system of differential equations .",
    "this is done by using a numerical code based on the gnu scientific library  @xcite .",
    "the ode integrator is based on a runge - kutta - fehlberg ( 4 , 5 ) method .",
    "the step size is taken to be the inverse of the sampling frequency ( 4  khz ) . using this method",
    ", we compute the waveform durations as a function of initial eccentricity and component masses ( see table .  [",
    "tab : duration ] ) .",
    "our results do not agree with those obtained in  @xcite : durations generated by our code are consistently 5% lower than those computed in  @xcite .",
    "this effect has been seen independently  @xcite .",
    "we performed another sanity check in the case where @xmath40 : we compare our waveform with a non - eccentric waveform ( at newtonian order ) that is generated with the ligo algorithm library ( lal )  @xcite .",
    "we found a perfect agreement  hz .",
    "] between the two waveforms .",
    "so , we think that the results in  @xcite may be biased due to a lack of accuracy in the evolution of the odes .",
    "we are now able to extend the waveform generation to higher masses and larger eccentricities as compared to ref .",
    "@xcite , whose study was limited to @xmath52 .",
    "the discrepancy that has been noted and the ability to extend investigations to higher mass range is also one of the motivation for revisiting their work .    in table .",
    "[ tab : duration ] , we provide the duration of the eccentric waveforms , denoted @xmath53 , for various component masses and eccentricities .",
    "table  [ tab : duration ] shows that for a given total mass , the duration of the signal decreases with increasing initial eccentricity .",
    "if a binary is highly eccentric initially , then its orbit shrinks faster by losing energy at a faster rate via radiation of gravitational waves .",
    "moreover , for a given initial eccentricity , the waveform duration decreases as the total mass increases .",
    "this behavior can be anticipated by looking at eq .",
    "( [ eq : dpdt ] ) , for which a larger initial value is expected for larger masses and larger eccentricity .",
    ".[tab : duration]duration of the gravitational - wave signal as a function of initial eccentricity and component masses .",
    "the lower cut - off frequency is @xmath50  hz . the numbers provided in this table show a systematic difference of about 5% compared to numbers from tab .",
    "i of  @xcite ; we believe that our results are more accurate than those from  @xcite ( see the text for an explanation ) .",
    "because the duration decreases when eccentricity and total mass increase , there is a combination for which the ending frequency of the waveform is below @xmath6 .",
    "in such a case , no waveform can be generated , which is represented by the / symbol . in brackets",
    ", we also provide the ratio of the duration of an eccentric waveform with respect to the first line , where @xmath40 .",
    "this ratio is independent of the component masses ( see fig .  [",

    "we summarize the results we obtained when searching for eccentric waveforms with circular waveforms .",
    "we limited the maximum value of eccentricity to @xmath54 , above which the loss of snr is always larger than 50% .",

    ", @xmath57 is close to 1 .",
    "however , in most of the parameter space , @xmath57 is much smaller than unity .",
    "it is convenient to represent @xmath57 with isocontours set to [ 96.5 , 95 , 90 , 80 , 50]% . using a value of 96.5%",
    "is useful because the loss of detection associated with it is about 10% .",
    "using a value of 95% is also useful because it corresponds to the minimal match of the template bank .",

    "the design sensitivity curve is based on initial ligo .",
    "the colors represent the value of the maximum match over the template bank .",
    "the minimal match of the bank is 95% .",

    "if we focus on the 95% isocontour , we can see that bnss are found with matches above 95% if initial eccentricity is below 0.05 . while the total mass increases up to @xmath60 , the initial eccentricity for which the match is greater than 95% increases up to a maximum value of 0.15 . as the total mass increases for a match of 95% or greater , from @xmath60 to about @xmath61",
    ", the initial eccentricity again goes down to 0.05 . above @xmath61",
    ", matches can go down to 90% even for negligible eccentricities but this is related to the template bank design .",
    "indeed , the template bank is optimally designed for signals that have a significant part of their power in a frequency band that resides where the detector has the best sensitivity .",
    "this assumption breaks down for signals with @xmath62 , which ending frequency is already as low as 110  hz whereas the detector best sensitivity is about 200  hz .",

    ", the initial eccentricity does not need to be taken into account in our searches for gravitational - wave signals if @xmath1 , because the loss of snr ( about 5% ) is consistent with the discreteness of the template bank that is being used .",

    "concerning the template bank placement , as we have explained , above @xmath90 the loss of snr may be quite large in some region of the parameter space .",
    "a solution may be to use a dedicated template bank to take into account the eccentricity .",
    "for instance , using the template bank used in this paper , we can have several layers of templates , each having a different values of initial eccentricity .",
    "more investigations are needed but preliminary studies shows that only a few layers are required to significantly improve the results ( the taylort3 family being replaced by the eccentric waveform presented here ) . finally , using monte - carlo simulations it would be interesting to estimate the error bound on the variance of the measured eccentricity .",
