    "the existence of polariton dispersion curves in ionic crystals is of great physical relevance , inasmuch as it allows one to explain the phenomenon of the dispersion of light in such crystals .",
    "polaritonic curves exist only if one takes into account the retarded nature of the electromagnetic forces among the ions in the crystal .",
    "indeed , if retardation is neglected one obtains the familiar coulomb model in which the dispersion curves of the crystal lattice and those of light are completely different , whereas they coincide along the polaritonic lines .",
    "so retardation is the essential necessary ingredient in order to explain the optics of crystals , and it will be shown here that it is the retarded interaction with the _ far _ ions that is actually responsible for the splitting .",
    "now , a splitting of the dispersion curves of an ionic crystal about the electromagnetic line @xmath0 , was apparently first predicted by born and huang ( see @xcite , pages 91 and 94 ) in the frame of a phenomenological discussion of the problem in terms of a macroscopic polarization field .",
    "further discussions were then given by fano @xcite and hopfield @xcite , still in terms of macroscopic polarization densities .",
    "the splitting was finally observed in the years 60s , first in semiconductors and later in lif and in other ionic crystals . in conclusion , it is now commonly assumed ( see for example @xcite , sections 7.2 and 7.3 ) that the phenomenon should be understood as due to retardation .",
    "however , retardation is usually introduced through the phenomenological maxwell equations which involve , in addition to the microscopic field @xmath1 , also the macroscopic field @xmath2 .",
    "a microscopic deduction is thus apparently lacking .    in the present paper",
    "such a microscopic deduction is given , in a classical frame .",
    "we consider a model in which the ions are dealt with as point particles , internal degrees of freedom being neglected .",
    "the existence of molecular repulsive forces balancing the coulomb ones , and thus allowing for the existence of a lattice , is assumed at a phenomenological level .",
    "the newton equations of motion for the displacements of the ions , with retardation of the electromagnetic forces taken into account , are written down in the linear approximation . at the end",
    "the model involves as free parameters the constants entering the repulsive forces , and the effective charge of each ion , in addition to the geometric parameters of the lattice and to the ions masses .",
    "the normal modes are numerically determined for crystals with a rock salt structure , through a suitable procedure , which is required in order to take the effect of retardation into account .",
    "the three free parameters are determined by a comparison with the experimental data of the dispersion curves of lif , while the remaining parameters were taken from the literature .",
    "finally , the electromagnetic field generated by the motions of the ions is discussed .",
    "the main results are the following :    1 .   in the dispersion curves of the lattice vibrations there appear branches that are absent in the purely _ `` mechanical or instantaneous '' model _ ( in which retardation is neglected ) , and correspond to the previously mentioned polaritonic splitting .",
    "the splitting turns out to be actually due to the retarded interaction with the _ far _ ions .",
    "the agreement between the theoretically computed dispersion curves and the experimental ones available in the literature for the case of lif ( see figures  [ fig:1 ] and  [ fig:2 ] ) is , in our opinion , fairly good for all values of @xmath3 in the whole brillouin zone . this is obtained with no need of introducing a phenomenological value for the static dielectric constant @xmath4 , which is here deduced from the theory .",
    "the electromagnetic field created by the motion of the ions can be decomposed into a microscopic part and a macroscopic one .",
    "the former propagates at the vacuum speed @xmath5 , while the latter propagates according to the laws of macroscopic optics , with a phase velocity @xmath6 .",
    "the dispersion relation @xmath7 of the macroscopic electric field coincides with the vibrational one of the lattice .    in section  2 the microscopic model is described and the linearized equations of motion are obtained . in section  3",
    "it is shown how , due to retardation , the secular equation presents a peculiar form , which is responsible for the occurrence of the splitting . in section",
    "4 the dispersion curves explicitly computed for rock salt lattices are reported , and the comparison with the experimental data is performed .",
    "some further general problems concerning the microscopic deduction of optics are discussed in section  5 .",
    "more comments are given in a conclusive section .",
    "appendix [ app : wf ] is devoted to recalling the role played by the so called wheeler ",
    "feynman identity@xcite ( which is a theorem in the present model ) in ensuring the stability of the lattice .",
    "indeed , such an identity guarantees that the microscopic dispersion relations do not contain imaginary terms , if the familiar _ _ radiation reaction force__@xcite acting on each ion is taken into account .",
    "appendices [ app : ewald ] and [ app : dynmatrix ] contain details about some analytical computations discussed in the text .",
    "we consider a model in which the ions are described as point charges , internal degrees of freedom being neglected .",
    "the ions interact both through a phenomenological effective potential , that accounts for the well - known short - range repulsive quantum effects associated to the `` impenetrability '' of matter , and through the forces due to the electromagnetic field created by all the other ions . in addition , each ion is subject to the radiation reaction force .",
    "the latter force is included because , although having a negligible magnitude , it plays a qualitatively relevant role in making the theory consistent , i.e. , in ensuring the stability of the lattice .",
    "so the newton equation of each ion ( with mass @xmath8 and position vector @xmath9 ) has the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote , respectively , the short - range repulsive force describing the interaction with neighboring ions , the electromagnetic force due to all the other ions , and the radiation reaction force .    actually the model is studied in its linearized version .",
    "so , first of all we assume there exists an equilibrium configuration in which the ions sit on the lattice sites @xmath14 of the crystal under consideration , determined by the repulsive forces and the coulomb ones . here , as usual , @xmath15 denotes the cell , while @xmath16 denotes the ion s species .",
    "thus , instead of the actual positions @xmath17 of the ions , the relevant quantities are the corresponding displacements @xmath18 so , the system of newton equations for the ions motions takes the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the mass of the ions of species @xmath21 .",
    "then the equations of motion are linearized with respect to the displacements .",
    "so , to start with , the magnetic field is completely neglected , and the abraham - lorentz - dirac radiation reaction force is taken in its nonrelativistic approximation , given by ( see @xcite ) @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the charge of the ions of species @xmath21 .    as far as the molecular repulsive forces are concerned , they may be assumed to have a phenomenological simplified form corresponding to two - body central potentials @xmath24 ( a priori different for each pair of species ) .",
    "then , the linearization procedure amounts to computing the derivatives of the total potential , evaluated at the equilibrium configuration . due to the short range of the repulsive forces",
    ", such derivatives rapidly approach zero as the distance between particles becomes sufficiently large ( roughly , for distances larger than the linear dimension of the unit cell ) .",
    "in fact one may assume that the interactions occur only over the neighbors of the @xmath25 ion .",
    "denoting by @xmath26 the relative positions of the @xmath27 neighbors of a @xmath28-th species ion with respect to the ion @xmath25 , it is easy to show that the linearized repulsive forces have the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the projection operators , respectively along the direction of the neighbor separation vector @xmath32 , and onto the plane normal to it . the parameters @xmath33{{\\mathbf}{r}_{{\\mathbf}{d}_j(s)}^{{\\scriptscriptstyle{(j,\\tau_j(s ) ) } } } }   \\bigr ) , \\\\   \\beta_{(j),s } & { \\coloneqq}\\frac{\\phi'_{{\\scriptscriptstyle{(j,\\tau_j(s))}}}\\bigl(\\abs[\\big]{{\\mathbf}{r}_{{\\mathbf}{d}_j(s)}^{{\\scriptscriptstyle{(j,\\tau_j(s ) ) } } } }     \\bigr)}{\\abs[\\big]{{\\mathbf}{r}_{{\\mathbf}{d}_j(s)}^{{\\scriptscriptstyle{(j,\\tau_j(s ) ) } } } } }   , \\end{split}\\ ] ] for @xmath34 , are characteristic of the concrete crystal under consideration . obviously , if a lattice presents a non - trivial point symmetry group , some of the parameters are likely to coincide .",
    "finally , we come to the linearization of the electric forces acting on each ion and due to all the other ones ( the magnetic forces having been neglected ) .",
    "the electromagnetic field created by the ions is taken in the dipole approximation , i.e. , as the field obtained from the maxwell equations when the charge distribution and the current density of the sources are linearized with respect to the displacements from their equilibrium positions .",
    "so the linearized source corresponding to a certain ion , labeled by a cell index @xmath35 and a species index @xmath36 , with actual motion @xmath37 , is the superposition of a _",
    "static source _",
    "@xmath38 , of zero  th order in the displacement @xmath39 , and of a first  order _ dipole source _ , with a dipole @xmath40 , both at the position @xmath41 .",
    "the solution of the corresponding inhomogeneous maxwell equations at the spacetime point @xmath42 is given by the superposition of the respective fields : a static spherically - symmetric _ coulomb field _",

    "we are using here the standard representation of the dipole field that one finds in the classical works of ewald @xcite , oseen @xcite and born @xcite on the subject . for a detailed derivation",
    "see for example @xcite or @xcite .",
    "such electric terms will be referred to as the `` coulomb term '' and the `` dipole term '' respectively .",
    "we now consider the forces resulting from the action of such fields upon a certain ion , identified by the cell index @xmath45 and the species index @xmath21 , due to all the other ones , in the linear approximation ( with respect to the displacements @xmath46 s ) .",
    "its actual motion is similarly denoted @xmath47 .",
    "the dipole field given by ( [ eq : lindipef ] ) , is already linear in @xmath39 , hence the linear approximation of the resulting electric force amounts to evaluating it at @xmath48 .",
    "summing over all ions of the lattice , the force due to the dipoles is thus @xmath49 where the prime in the sums denotes that the term @xmath50 is excluded . for what concerns",
    "the force due to the static coulomb field , one has to take the force given by ( [ eq : coulfield ] ) , evaluate it at the point @xmath47 , and expand it up to the first order in @xmath51 .",
    "the zeroth order term is balanced by the short range repulsive contribution , because we are evaluating the field at the equilibrium configuration , while the linear term can be written in a form which resembles that of the dipole term and highlights the electrostatic potential .",

    "using the identity @xmath54 which holds for any scalar field @xmath55 , and taking for @xmath55 the coulomb potential , the linearized electric force given by the coulomb term reads @xmath56 so , summing over all ions of the lattice one gets @xmath57{{\\mathbf}{x}- { { \\mathbf } { r}_{{\\mathbf}{p}}^{{\\scriptscriptstyle { ( s ) } } } } } }   \\bigg\\vert_{{\\mathbf}{x}= { { \\mathbf } { r}_{{\\mathbf}{h}}^{{\\scriptscriptstyle { ( j ) } } } } } ; \\\\\\ ] ] where the prime in the sum denotes that the term @xmath50 is excluded .",

    "equations ( [ eq : lineareq ] ) constitute a system of infinitely many linear equations with delay , in the unknowns @xmath60 .",
    "the problem of discussing equations and solving them represents a formidable task . as usual",
    ", our study will be restricted to the search for _ generalized normal modes _ ,",
    "i.e. , oscillating modes , possibly including damped and unstable ones .",
    "furthermore , by factoring the spatial cell dependency in the form of a plane wave , the translational symmetry of the crystal is exploited to get rid of the cell index , thus obtaining a parametric dependence on a wavevector @xmath3 varying in the brillouin zone .",
    "so we substitute the plane - wave _ ansatz _ @xmath61 into the equations of motion and look at the corresponding equations .",

    "in fact one has @xmath66 where in the last line we simply replaced the dummy index @xmath67 by @xmath35 .",
    "so , substituing the above relations into equation ( [ eq : lineareq ] ) , after dividing by the common factor @xmath68 one gets to the set of linear equations in the unknown @xmath69 @xmath70 with @xmath71 , we have in all @xmath72 linear equations , in which @xmath3 enters as a parameter and @xmath64 as an unknown .",
    "such equations can be written symbolically in the form @xmath73 \\cdot { \\mathbf}{u}^{{\\scriptscriptstyle{(s ) } } }   + i \\frac{2}{3 } \\frac { \\left ( q^{{\\scriptscriptstyle{(j ) } } } \\right)^2 } { c^3 } \\omega^3 { \\mathbf}{u}^{{\\scriptscriptstyle{(j ) } } } \\ ; , \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] having denoted by @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 respectively the matrix of the short - range repulsive forces , that of the coulomb forces , and that of the dipole ones . in short , we can also write the equations for the normal modes in the form @xmath77 which involves a _ dynamical matrix _ @xmath78 in a way apparently similar to that occurring in the case of the `` instantaneous '' coulomb model .",
    "a sharp difference is however that the dynamical matrix @xmath78 now depends on the _ unknown _ @xmath64 , besides on the wavevector parameter @xmath3 .",
    "such a dependency is obviously contained in the dipole part .",
    "_ this is a peculiar and remarkable consequence of retardation _ , which entails that equation does _ not _ give rise to a standard secular equation .",
    "denoting by @xmath79 the mass matrix , the analogue of the secular equation presently takes the form @xmath80 this makes the dispersion relations more difficult to compute . due to the @xmath64-dependency of the dynamical matrix , the solutions can not be worked out through standard diagonalization methods of linear algebra , and a more general numerical algorithm is required .",
    "moreover , we see that the @xmath64-dependency of the entries of @xmath78 is by no means simple ; actually it is not algebraic , neither can it be expressed in terms of elementary functions .",
    "thus , it is not even possible to foresee how many solutions , for each value of @xmath3 do exist .",
    "the number of branches and their topology may vary in a substantial way with respect to the `` mechanical or instantaneous '' case , which displays @xmath81 optical branches and @xmath82 acoustic ones .",
    "this is indeed what makes the existence of polaritonic branches possible .",
    "one sees that the instantaneous coulomb limit case is formally obtained by taking the limit @xmath83 ( or equivalently @xmath84 ) in the dipole field in .",
    "in such a limit , the sum of the coulomb term and of the dipole one gives simply an additional `` mechanical '' term , completely analogous to the molecular repulsive one , the only difference being that the long range of the coulomb forces makes a resummation procedure necessary .",
    "however , it turns out that this limit misses most of the physics involved in the region about the e.m .",
    "dispersion curve @xmath85 , which is the primary goal of the present discussion .",
    "the sums over the lattice , which define the electric fields in , are obviously ill - defined , due to the long range of the e.m .",
    "interactions . a precise meaning",
    "is assigned to them through the well - known _",
    "ewald s summation _ procedure@xcite .",
    "this transforms each conditionally convergent series into the sum of two rapidly convergent ones , which account for the `` short  distance '' part and the `` long  distance '' part of the interactions respectively .",
    "the use of such a method is crucial , for it provides a deep insight into the physical aspect of the problem .",
    "it turns out that only the term describing long - distance interactions is substantially modified by the @xmath64-dependency ( i.e. , by retardation ) , and that such dependency is important only in the region about the e.m .",
    "dispersion curve @xmath86 .",
    "the details of the ewald s summation method can be found either in his original paper @xcite or in more recent works ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a compact exposition can also be found in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "a slight generalization of the method had to be devised in order to deal with the dipole fields .",
    "this is discussed in appendix [ app : ewald ] .",
    "it turns out that , once the ewald resummation has been performed , the dipole part of the dynamical matrix takes , for @xmath87 , the structure @xmath88\\bigg\\vert_{{\\mathbf}{x}= { { \\mathbf } { b}_{{\\mathbf}{}}^{{\\scriptscriptstyle { ( j , l ) } } } } } \\\\",

    "the notations are as follows : @xmath89 runs over the direct lattice , @xmath90 runs over the reciprocal lattice ; @xmath91 for @xmath16 are the positions of the ions within a unit cell ( @xmath92 ) ; @xmath93 is the region of a cell and @xmath94 its volume .",
    "furthermore , @xmath95 is the matrix form of the differential operator @xmath96 : for a scalar field @xmath97 one has @xmath98 = \\hat{h } [ f({\\mathbf}{x } ) ] - \\delta[f({\\mathbf}{x } ) ] \\hat{\\mathbb{i}}_3\\ ] ] where @xmath99 $ ] is the hessian of @xmath97 ( the matrix of its second derivatives ) , @xmath100 the laplacian and @xmath101 the identity matrix .",
    "for @xmath102 the matrix element has just the same form , apart from the fact that the unphysical self - interaction term must be subtracted . here",
    "a very interesting fact occurs : such a subtracted term gives rise to a non - hermitian part for the dipole term matrix , that is _ exactly canceled _ by the radiation reaction term ( the last one in , which is clearly non - hermitian , too ) . indeed ,",
    "as shown in appendix  [ app : wf ] , for all @xmath103 one has @xmath104 hence , the complete dynamical matrix @xmath78 is hermitian , so that only real frequencies are allowed .",
    "we thus see that the radiation reaction force is vital to the stability of the lattice : a nonvanishing imaginary part in the frequency would correspond to damped or unstable oscillations .",
    "this a priori unexpected cancellation , first realized by oseen@xcite , and then rediscovered in @xcite , might seem `` accidental '' at first sight .",
    "the proof of such a cancellation , given in appendix  [ app : wf ] , shows its deep meaning , first pointed out by wheeler and feynman@xcite .",
    "the _ splitting parameter _",
    "@xmath105 in  , involved in ewald s method , is arbitrary , to be chosen so that both series converge rapidly .",
    "if it is taken of the order of the inverse first - neighbor interatomic distance , one sees that @xmath106 if one takes @xmath64 in the range of the typical frequencies of crystal dynamics , i.e. , @xmath107 hz . hence we may safely take @xmath108 in the corresponding exponential in the second term : the @xmath64dependency of the short  distance part of the interactions is negligible , so that they can be considered as instantaneous . instead , the first term , which describes the long  distance part of the interactions , is strongly frequency - dependent : the term @xmath109 has in fact a pole at @xmath0 , i.e. , along the e.m . dispersion line .",
    "this is the main mathematical effect of retardation : the part of the dynamical matrix which describes the interaction with the far charges strongly depends on the frequency @xmath64 near the e.m .",
    "dispersion curve @xmath0 .",
    "hence , very different predictions are expected with respect to the instantaneous coulomb model . in the following ,",
    "we show that such a feature leads indeed to retrieve the polariton curves .",
    "at this point we are no longer able to proceed any further on a general discussion . in order to check concretely the predictions of the model ,",
    "a numerical study is needed , and so we concentrate on a specific crystal structure . in view of a comparison with experimental data ,",
    "we choose the _ rock salt _ structure , which is in fact very simple and is shared by the most common alkali halides .",
    "concretely , the comparison with the experimental data was performed for the case of lithium floride , lif .",
    "so , we first have to explicitly write down the dynamical matrix @xmath78 in general , which is done in appendix [ app : dynmatrix ] .",
    "then , the expressions thus found have to be specialized to the case of the rock salt lattice .    in order to solve numerically the generalized secular equation , with the dynamical matrix @xmath78 now computed for a generic rock salt lattice , we devised a very general and straightforward algorithm .",
    "the overall idea is the following .",
    "the wavevector @xmath3 is let run along certain directions from the zone center to the zone boundary , and the frequency @xmath64 is let vary in a suitable range .",
    "then , considering both @xmath3 and @xmath64 as parameters , the dynamical matrix is numerically evaluated , and a generalized diagonalization is performed , by determining the six values @xmath110 such that @xmath111 . eventually , leaving @xmath3 only as a parameter , the roots of the equations @xmath112 are numerically determined for each @xmath113 .",
    "this yields the admissible excitation frequencies of the lattice for the given wavevector @xmath3 . in particular , as previously mentioned ,",
    "the pole in the matrix elements along the line @xmath0 gives rise to a corresponding pole for certain eigenvalues ( as functions of @xmath64 ) , and hence the number of solutions of doubles : at variance with the instantaneous coulomb model , we have more than @xmath72 branches . for values of @xmath3 and @xmath64 far from the line @xmath0 the whole procedure is actually redundant , because the instantaneous approximation is perfectly suitable .",
    "now , the dispersion curves thus found still depend on the three free parameters entering the model , which are determined by a best fit with the experimental phonon curves .",
    "the best fit thus obtained is exhibited in figure [ fig:1 ] . in table",
    "[ tab : valueslif ] the numerical values employed for the parameters entering the model are collected .    the three panels give @xmath64 versus @xmath114 for the three high  symmetry directions of @xmath115 @xmath116 ( left ) , @xmath117 ( center ) and @xmath118 ( right ) for the whole brillouin zone .",
    "the triangles are the experimental values taken from @xcite , while the continuous lines give the theoretical curves .",
    "the global agreement over the whole brillouin zone seems to us to be fairly good , in consideration of the simplicity of the model , and of the small number ( three ) of free parameters .",
    "in fact , one can notice that the fit is not so good for the acoustic branches , especially for high @xmath114 .",
    "a better fit over the whole brillouin zone was actually obtained in the paper @xcite , using second  nearest  neighbor short range forces , in a model involving seven free parameters .",
    "so , presumably , an analogous better fit could have been obtained by us too by making recourse to a more refined model for the short range forces .",
    "however , we did not care for this , because our main goal is to exhibit the occurrence of polaritons in the simplest possible way .    [",

    "they are exhibited in figure  [ fig:2 ] , in which a zoom of the left panel of figure  [ fig:1 ] is performed , by enlarging by a factor @xmath125 the axis of the absciss .",
    "as expected , near the line @xmath0 , the number and the topology of the branches are drastically different with respect to those of the instantaneous approximation , and presents a pattern displaying polaritonic curves .     for small @xmath114 , exhibiting polaritonic branches .",

    "this result means that at least a relevant part of the infrared dispersion phenomenology in ionic crystals can be deduced from the _ vibrational _ dispersion relations : indeed through equation the refraction index can be expressed as a function of frequency .",
    "the interaction between radiation and matter ( or _ phonon - photon coupling _ , in the quantum picture ) can be interpreted in terms of such relations .",
    "so , by studying a microscopic classical model of an ionic crystal with the ions dealt with as point charges , we have shown that the retarded action of the _ far _ ions is responsible for the splitting of the dispersion curves about the e.m .",
    "dispersion line @xmath0 , i.e. , for the existence of polaritons in ionic crystals .    a fairly good quantitative agreement between the theoretical polaritonic curves and the experimental data for lithium fluoride",
    "is obtained directly from microscopic dynamics , without further _ ad hoc _ assumptions or the use of any fitting parameters , apart from the three parameters ( effective charge of the ions and two constants entering the repulsive forces ) related to the non  retarded part of the problem . in any case , polaritons come out automatically in virtue of retardation , without the need of introducing any new parameter , once the instantaneous part of the problem has been settled . for what concerns",
    "the choice of the free parameters , one may notice that they could also be determined from experimental data not related to the dispersion curves , as for example thermodynamic quantities such as the internal energy or data on the infrared absorption ( see @xcite ) .",
    "one may now ask whether an explanation of dispersion can in some analogous way be given also for other types of crystal insulators .",
    "the simplest model is obtained by considering a lattice of pure dipoles .",
    "such a model was already studied in the work @xcite , and a phenomenon analogous to that of existence of polaritonic curves was observed .",
    "we finally add now a comment concerning the treatment of the problem given in the book of born and huang .",
    "we already mentioned that such authors predicted the existence of polaritons in the first part of the book , where the problem is discussed in terms of macroscopic polarization fields .",
    "it seems however that a proof is lacking in the second part of the book , which is devoted to a microscopic discussion of the problem .",
    "apparently this is due to the fact that , in discussing the secular equation , the authors do not introduce explicitly @xmath64 as an unknown of the problem , limiting themselves to introduce the _ ansatz _ @xmath159 .",
    "this entails that the upper polaritonic branch can not be detected .",
    "moreover , at page 334 , they explicitly say that _  the last term _",
    "( i.e. , the retarded one ) _ can be ignored_.    1.em * acknowledgement * : we thank giuseppe pastori parravicini .",
    "having read the papers @xcite and @xcite , where retardation was taken into account in microscopic models involving internal dipoles only , he suggested that polaritons may be proven to exist by analogous methods , if one considers a model involving the displacements of the ions .",
    "in discussing the secular equation , it was already pointed out that the term , due to the radiation reaction force entering the newton equation for each ion , exactly cancels the non - hermitian part of the dynamical matrix , so that one is left with a hermitian dynamical matrix .",
    "this has the consequence that only real frequencies @xmath64 ( i.e. stable non - damped oscillations ) are allowed , so that the lattice can _ exist_. as mentioned in @xcite , such a cancellation was first pointed out by oseen@xcite in the year 1916 .",
    "note that a priori such a cancellation is by no means evident nor obvious : when radiation effects are taken into account , one might expect that non - trivial energy exchanges occur , and damped oscillations may arise due to uncompensated energy losses .",
    "it should be noted that , if @xmath64 has a positive imaginary part , the dipole term series describing the retarded interaction diverges",
    ". the actual role of the radiation reaction force deserves thus to be pointed out : its inclusion in the equations of motion is vital in order to make the lattice stable , and in allowing for the existence itself of a dispersion relation ; omitting this term would lead to a substantial inconsistency of the model .",
    "it might seem that the oseen cancellation occurring for the non - hermitian part of the dynamical matrix , arises `` accidentally '' .",
    "here we provide a proof , more significant than the straightforward computation implicitly carried out in the text .",
    "the present proof shows that the origin of the cancellation is actually deeper , and can ultimately be ascribed to the symmetry of electrodynamics with respect to time inversion .",
    "in fact , we prove here that the present model of ionic crystal satisfies the following identity , first proposed by wheeler and feynman@xcite : @xmath160 where the summation index @xmath114 runs over all the charged particles of the system and @xmath161 is the e.m .",
    "field tensor .",
    "this evidently points out the symmetrical role played by the retarded and the advanced solutions of the maxwell equations . we will then show that this identity actually implies the oseen cancellation .    first of all",
    ", it is clear that the zeroth - order coulomb fields trivially satisfy the above identity , because they are independent of time . in addition , recall that we are neglecting magnetic fields , which give second - order effects .",
