    "for many years , broad - band photometry was used as the primary tool in deriving ages for both single bursts and mixed stellar populations . broadly speaking ,",
    "blue colours were taken to be indicative of young populations , while red colours were associated with older populations .",
    "only dust was thought to complicate this picture , through the general reddening of the population . from an observational perspective",
    ", few works have considered the potential contaminating impact of gas emission upon broadband colours .",
    "for example , @xcite analysed carefully , colour - colour diagrams , taking into account this correction , and thereby proposing a mechanism for separating the contribution from the underlying stellar population , starburst population , and line emission , for better quantitative comparison with evolutionary models of stellar populations . from a theoretical perspective",
    ", colours were calculated typically for the stellar component only or , in a few cases , by taking into account the nebular continuum . only recently , several works ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) have started to quantify the role of line emission from ionised gas surrounding young star clusters in the contamination of broad - band colours .",
    "these latter authors examined two young massive clusters in ngc  4449 , demonstrating that the contribution of both nebular continuum and line emission is essential to reproduce the observed broad - band fluxes .",
    "the comparison of model spectral energy distributions with and without nebular continuum and/or emission lines shows that the inferred stellar mass can change by up to a factor of @xmath32.5 , depending upon the filter in question .",
    "@xcite also find that nebular lines can contaminate the total broadband flux by @xmath30.3  mag ( median , but up to @xmath31  mag , in certain cases ) .",
    "this effect is important since low - redshift galaxies with active star formation may mimic the colour - selection criteria used in some high - redshift dropout surveys .",
    "this potential impact on the mass and age of galaxies is also important for cosmological studies which use these values as clues to disentangling the temporal history of galaxy assembly . despite this importance , to our knowledge",
    "there is no available systematic grid of models which includes the effect of emission lines on broadband colours spanning a wide range in age and metallicity .",
    "our work has been designed to fill this gap .    over the past two decades , a wealth of powerful ground - based facilities , particularly in the visible ,",
    "has driven the use of spectroscopic techniques to infer the underlying physical properties of ionising star clusters .",
    "high signal - to - noise spectra were required , in order to derive the nebular electron density and electronic temperature , and from these gas parameters , the abundance content . in the absence of a consistent grid of models against which to compare ,",
    "photometric information has not been used as the main tool for deriving star - forming properties . in terms of observations",
    ", there were few consistent samples of hii regions ( or small to medium - size star - forming objects ) that would allow us to test models and from which we could extract statistical conclusions .",
    "moreover , these existing observational samples were usually biased towards bright and low - to - intermediate metallicity regions .",
    "this subject has been exhaustively discussed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereinafter paper ii ) , in which we presented the emission line spectra for our models as a function of the physical properties of the ionising clusters and compared the resulting diagnostic diagrams with a complete spectroscopic sample of hii regions for which abundances were derived consistently using an appropriate empirical calibration .",
    "the recent generation of deep surveys , taken with mid - to - large aperture telescopes , have now released complete photometric catalogues of star forming regions and galaxies at different redshifts .",
    "this has motivated us to deliver a set of models which can aid in the derivation of the physical properties of stellar populations , without the necessity of spectroscopic data . with this in mind , we have computed the colours and other common photometric parameters , such h@xmath0  radius , h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  equivalent widths and h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  luminosities .",
    "we are convinced that these models will be a powerful tool in the interpretation of star - forming region photometric data , providing the means to infer their mass , age , and metallicity when embedded within more complex and evolved systems .",
    "we have computed colours previously with the popstar seds in both johnson and sdss systems ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , paper i ) .",
    "we present now the colour evolution of star forming regions formed by a ssp , including the contribution of the strongest emission lines from the ionised nebula , which can be used to derive the physical properties of the ionising clusters .",
    "these ssp models can be used directly to compare with specific , usually small and detailed , photometric samples , where colours have been corrected for the contamination from an underlying population . however ,",
    "this is not the general case , since the subtraction of the underlying population delivers results that are not always reliable ; furthermore , this approach is not the most commonly used one when a large amount of data , like the output of extremely large surveys , are analysed .",
    "such surveys are used to obtain statistical conclusions about the star forming regions , and therefore the use of appropriate theoretical models is essential . for this reason , in addition to the ssp models ,",
    "we have also computed a complete set of photometric properties for mixed populations , to simulate local star - forming regions embedded in more complex star systems .",
    "these models are particularly useful when the subtraction of an underlying population is not sufficiently reliable .",
    "this paper describes the photometrical model and demonstrates how photometry can be an alternative and powerful tool in the delivery of inferred ages and metallicities for star forming regions , as well as how it can give an estimation of the mass - ratio of the star - forming region to that of the underlying population .",
    "the models presented here are applicable to nearby / local star forming regions only , since the contribution of the emission lines varies with redshift .",
    "it is obvious that the most important emission lines contaminate different filters , with different transmittance , as a function of redshift .",
    "we outline the importance of an extension of this work to higher redshift , to study the impact of emission lines on broadband photometry of samples at different redshift .",
    "dust re - emission and near - ir photometry will be also included to extend the use of the models to large samples covering a wide range of redshifts .",
    "section 2 summarises the main properties of the grid of evolutionary synthesis models used to compute the magnitudes of pure ssps , the method to calculate the emission line intensities of the photo - ionised nebula and , consequently , the associated contaminated colours .",
    "section 3 presents and analyses the results of our models for young ionising ssps .",
    "these models can be used for deriving the physical properties of the ionising populations in regions whose observed colours have been previously de - contaminated from the underlying populations .",
    "section 4 describes the set of models for mixed populations , applicable to characterising star - forming regions where these bursts are placed on an underlying population and where we can not separate both components observationally .",
    "finally , section 5 summarises our results .",
    "a detailed description of popstar can be found in paper i. popstar provides a set of evolutionary synthesis models for ssps , covering a wide range in age and metallicity .",
    "the basic grid is composed of ssps for six different initial mass functions ( imfs ) . for this work ,",
    "we have used only a salpeter imf @xcite with lower and upper mass limits of 0.15 and 100  m@xmath4 , respectively .",
    "we have not included binaries nor mass segregation .",
    "the isochrones employed are updated versions of those from @xcite for six metallicities : z = 0.0001 , 0.0004 , 0.004 , 0.008 , 0.02 , and 0.05 . the use of very low metallicity models ( z=0.0001 ) was not included in comparable work prior to that of popstar .",
    "the age ranges from @xmath5 to 10.30 with a variable time resolution reaching @xmath6 in the youngest populations .",
    "again , details of the isochrones are described in paper  i.    stellar atmosphere models are taken from @xcite , due to its expansive coverage in effective temperature , gravity , and metallicities , for stars with teff @xmath7k . for o , b , and wr stars ,",
    "the nlte blanketed models of @xcite ( for metallicities z @xmath8 , 0.004 , 0.008 , 0.02 , and 0.04 ) are used .",
    "there are 110 models for o - b stars , calculated by @xcite , with 25000k @xmath9 teff @xmath10k and @xmath11 , and 120 models for wr stars ( 60 wn and 60 wc ) , from @xcite , with 30000k @xmath12k and @xmath13 for wn , and with @xmath14k and @xmath15 for wc . t@xmath16 and r@xmath16 are the temperature and the radius at a roseland optical depth of 10 .",
    "the assignment of the appropriate wr model is consistently made by using the relationships between opacity , mass loss , and velocity wind , as described in paper  i. for post - agb and planetary nebulae ( pn ) with t@xmath17 between 50000k and 220000k , the nlte models from @xcite are taken . for higher temperatures ,",
    "popstar uses black - bodies .",
    "the use of these latter models modifies the resulting intermediate age seds .    for each cluster ,",
    "the total mechanical energy from stellar winds and supernova has been calculated .",
    "we have used this mechanical energy to calculate the hii region s inner radius ( see  2.2 ) .",
    "we have also computed the nebular continuum emission from hydrogen and helium ( he and he@xmath18 ) free - free , free - bound , and 2-photon continuum emission .",
    "the seds ( stellar+nebular ) corresponding to the six metallicities and ages up to 20myr have been introduced to the photo - ionisation code cloudy @xcite to obtain the emission line spectra ( see paper ii for details ) .",
    "we take seven possible cluster masses : 1.2 @xmath19 , 2.0 @xmath20 , 4.0 @xmath20 , 6.0 @xmath19 , 1.0 @xmath21 , 1.5 @xmath21 and 2.0 @xmath22 m@xmath4 selected to cover the h@xmath0  luminosity range observed for medium - to - large hii regions .",
    "the gas surrounding the cluster is assumed to have the same chemical composition as the stars of the cluster .",
    "for each metallicity , the element abundances heavier than helium have been scaled by a constant factor , with respect to the hydrogen content , according to the solar abundances from @xcite and depleted when necessary ( see table 2 from paper ii ) .",
    "the models assume a bubble geometry , with an ionised bounded nebula whose size is given by the cluster evolution .",
    "therefore , the internal radius of the shell is the distance at which the ionised gas is deposited in that nebula by the cluster s mechanical energy .",
    "be aware that the observed radius of an hii region is not necessarily the inner radius of the ionised region ( see  2.2 ) .",
    "the effect of dust here has not been included .",
    "the hydrogen density has been considered constant throughout the nebula and equal to the electron density for complete ionisation .",
    "we have generated models assuming two different values of electron density , n@xmath23 : 10  @xmath24 and 100  @xmath24 , in order to quantify the impact of density on the emitted spectrum .",
    "a density of 10 @xmath24 is more appropriate for small - medium isolated hii regions while 100 @xmath24 is more appropriate for hii galaxies , large circumnuclear hii regions , often found around the nuclei of starbursts , or agn . although the constant density hypothesis is not realistic when detailed nebular studies are done , it can be considered representative when the integrated spectrum of the nebula is analysed .",
    "results from the photo - ionisation models and their application to spectroscopic observations of hii regions are widely discussed in paper  ii .",
    "the number of ionising photons , q(h ) , and the h@xmath0  and h@xmath1   luminosities have been calculated in paper i. the equivalent width of h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  are here calculated from the single population plus the nebular continuum ( in the case of ssps ) or from the sum of all stellar populations plus nebular continuum , in the case of mixed populations (  4 ) . from the computed seds , we previously calculated their corresponding total ( stellar + nebular ) uncontaminated colours in paper i ; now , using the cloudys output , we compute the colours including the contamination from emission lines , as described in  2.3 .      throughout this work , we assume a scenario in which sufficient gas exists to be ionised ( i.e. , matter - bounded models have not been considered ) and in which the birth of a star cluster , which we consider to be placed in the centre of a spherical region , is produced . in fact , we will not be able to detect the region in the visible until the neutral gas has started to be ionised , allowing detection of the emission lines ( in particular the balmer lines ) . for that , we need to have not only ionising photons but also certain nebula conditions , including a given gas density and an optical depth for the emitting region .",
    "these conditions occur around 0.5 - 1.0myr after cluster formation .",
    "as cluster evolves , the mechanical energy of the massive stars winds begins to sweep the gas away , compressing it and producing a shell .",
    "the wind - driven shell begins then to evolve with an initial phase of free expansion , followed by an adiabatic expansion phase , and then the swept - up material collapses to a thin , cold shell as a result of radiative cooling ( * ? ? ?",

    "the stacking of the material is caused by the shock wave providing a compression of the surrounding gas and therefore an increase of the recombinations ( @xmath39 n@xmath40 ) . due to the balance between the ionising flux and the number of recombinations in the whole region ,",
    "the presence of a shell more massive and larger will affect the overall size of the hii region and the ionisation front , which will be trapped inside the shell where all the photons will be employed .",

    "we will still see the region with a different emission line spectrum resulting from the cluster evolution ( that changes both the ionising spectrum and the region geometry ) .",
    "we identify the observed object as an hii region ( by definition ) if we can detect hydrogen in emission , and this happens even after the emission line spectrum of forbidden lines is over and up to 20myr ( in average because there is a metallicity dependence ) .    the external radius of the region , which we would identify as the observed one in most photometric observations , is plotted against age in fig .

    "this radius starts with a value of around hundreds of pc , smaller for n@xmath45 100@xmath24 , and then decreases until sne explosions begin to appear , which increase again the size of the region .",
    "once the sne explosions start to appear in the region , they can change the appearance and/or the geometry , however , we then should be more cautious when interpreting the observations based on our models , since the emission line spectrum will be the result of the shock and the photo - ionisation mechanisms .",
    "our models do not include a shock contribution that can affect some emission lines , including [ oi]6300  .    besides the evolution of the radius of the region measured on the h@xmath0  images , we show in fig .",

    "[ lha_age ] we see that h@xmath0  luminosity maintains a high level for ages longer than 5myr and it maintains a detectable intensity until 20myr for the lowest abundances .",
    "this fact will have an impact on the colours , as we will see in the next section .",
    "the equivalent width shows a similar decreasing dependence with age , but also shows high values after the first 5.5  myr for z=0.0001 and z=0.0004 , while it falls to zero for the other abundances .",
    "fig  [ rout_lhalpha ] shows the outer radius of the region as a function of the logarithm of h@xmath0  luminosity .",
    "models for different cluster masses are represented with different colours , as before .",
    "we see that hii regions may be quite large in size and luminosities for the lowest abundances compared with the metal - rich regions .",
    "therefore if these regions are not observed , we need to consider potential observational selection effects . on the contrary , the metal - rich h ii regions are much smaller , implying difficulty in observing these regions .",
    "it seems that an inverse correlation between size and luminosity arises from these plots for luminosities lower than @xmath47  erg  s@xmath35 if the evolution of one cluster mass is followed , with larger radii for longer evolutionary times , when the h@xmath48 luminosity decreases .",
    "observations instead show a positive correlation between size and luminosity .",

    "we compare these models with data from @xcite and @xcite , shown as grey symbols .",
    "we see that some data fall out of the region defined by our models .",
    "in fact , observational points ( which proceed from hii regions of different galaxies ) show an abrupt decrease at a given luminosity , followed by a smooth increase that indicates the transition time in which massive star winds disappear and sne start to increase the size of the bubble .",
    "however , some observational points seem to affect this change at an h@xmath0  luminosity higher than our models have .",
    "thus , most observations from @xcite show a behaviour that would be reproduced by models with a cluster mass larger than 2 @xmath22m@xmath4 , our maximum cluster mass , or with a different imf .",
    "differences in the mass limits or slope of the imf will change the mass distribution in the cluster generation , with direct consequences on the number of ionizing photons and lh@xmath0 .",
    "this effect was discussed in paper i ( moll et  al .",
    "2009 ) . on the other end , many data from @xcite need a cluster mass smaller than 1.2 @xmath19m@xmath4 , the lowest limit of the models computed here .",
    "these latter observations show a similarly strong increase around lh@xmath0 @xmath51erg.s@xmath35 , slightly smaller than that shown by the lowest cluster mass model . therefore in panel b ) , we compare our models only with the other two sets of data from @xcite and @xcite fitted by ionised clusters whose masses are within our model range .",
    "doing so , we see that the observed correlation between size and luminosity is reproduced with our models , the dispersion for is driven by the range in cluster masses . in that panel",
    "the red line is the least - squares straight fit to the data while the black line is the corresponding one for models .",
    "however , we warn that this correlation is not totally due to an evolutionary effect - as it has been argued in previous works - but a combination of the evolutionary state ( age ) and the mass of the cluster .",
    "a model with a given cluster mass shows a decrease in the size , while decreasing the h@xmath0  luminosity , before the sne explosion time .",
    "then , a new increase in the size of the region is seen ( see fig  6 ) , while the h@xmath48 luminosity continues decreasing . only when all cluster masses are included in the same plot ( fig .",

    "the effect will be similar for more distant galaxies , where the emission line contribution to the different bands will change with redshift for the standard systems ( e.g. johnson , sdss , etc . ) .",
    "this can impact upon estimations of some m / l relationships and/or dust extinction in systems at different redshifts dominated by young ionising star forming bursts .",
    "it will also be more important at increasing redshift than at redshift zero , since the star formation becomes more violent and the mass of the young ionising population becomes larger .",
    "when a detailed study of the photometric evolution at high - redshift is performed , it will be necessary to take into account that a large number of star - forming regions could be contributing in the different pass - bands , changing the canonical and widely accepted colour - colour theoretical diagrams for synthetic populations .",

    "these f values and the legend have been labelled in the v - r _ vs _ r - i diagrams . the higher the value of f , the smaller the emission lines impact on the integrated colour , as expected . in the plots ,",
    "larger differences between dashed and solid lines can be appreciated for small f values while both lines are almost coincident for large f values .",
    "the cases with @xmath62 correspond to a pure young population and therefore to the case discussed in  3 of this paper .",
    "it can also seen that as the young population evolves , the contribution of the lines tends to disappear , and the dashed and solid lines tend towards coincidence .",
    "when f is in the range 1 ( magenta line ) to 10 ( blue line ) , the old population contributes in a small proportion and the young population dominates the system . in these cases , colours u - b , v - r and r - i for the first evolutionary phases of the young population ( age @xmath63myr ) present a behaviour close to the one with f around 100 and no - emission lines contribution ( green dashed lines ) .",
    "it means that using a mixture of two populations without taking into account the emission line contribution , can lead to a misinterpretation , by assigning a stronger contribution of the underlying population than the actual one .",
    "thus , for this particular example , the error determination can be as high as one order of magnitude in the f value , implying a similar error for the determination of the mass of the underlying population ( assuming that we can constrain the young population mass through other photometric values , like the h@xmath0  luminosity ) .",
    "only the colour b - v and somehow u - b seem to provide similar estimations for the old population s age , regardless of the models used ( with or without emission lines ) .",
    "a similar behaviour is observed in the case ( 2 ) , displayed in the four bottom panels , which indicates that this effect is quite independent of the metallicity for these examples .",
    "of course , these conclusions can change for other combinations of metallicities and for younger ages of the old population .",
    "the potential confusion will become larger when a stronger starburst is overlapping with an intermediate - age population .",
    "we have plotted this extreme case with a very old underlying population to demonstrate that even in this system we can find important differences in the inferred physical properties when using canonical models instead of the ones with the emission line contribution .",
    "[ colorsmixs_age ] shows the same example of mixed populations , but for sdss colours .",
    "the plots for case ( 1 ) show the same effect of possible misinterpretation in the colours u - g , g - r , and r - i when using uncontaminated colours instead the ones including the emission line contribution .",
    "again , differences larger than one order of magnitude in the burst strength can be inferred . from the lower panels ( case 2 ) ,",
    "all the colours , and especially r - i and i - z , would lead to misinterpretation .",
    "we can not provide plots for the whole range of age , mass , and metallicity of the contributing populations , but given a specific set of photometric observations , a good representation of the reality may be obtained by fitting the different parameters to the theoretical models , following for example a mean square error ( mse ) as a measure of estimator quality .",
    "we provide the complete set of tables and models in electronic format to allow these computations .",
    "the same mix of stellar populations as before are represented in fig.[colorsmixj_colormixj ] and fig.[colorsmixs_colormixs ] as colour - colour diagrams . as in fig .",
    "[ colorsmixj_age ] and fig .",
    "[ colorsmixs_age ] , different colour lines represent different ratios in mass , f , between old and young stellar populations .",
    "thus red lines give the colour - colour results when the old stellar population dominates in mass , with a value of 10@xmath64 m@xmath4  over the young one of 10@xmath58m@xmath4 while the black lines represent the evolution of a simple young stellar population without underlying population .",
    "all the other colours ( orange , green , blue and magenta ) represent intermediate cases .",
    "the dashed lines are the results without the emission line contribution while the solid lines show our results including the emission line contamination . in these figures ,",
    "the model results given by the solid lines ( emission lines included ) can be bluer or redder , compared to the models of the dashed - lines ( no emission lines ) .",
    "this will depend also on f. for a given value of f , models on the solid lines ( with lines ) will be close or far from the canonical solid line ( they can be placed also on an orthogonal line ) depending on the age of the young population as discussed in  3 .",
    "our results predict a large dispersion among the observational values when plotting them in colour - colour plots , explaining in a natural way this fact .",
    "previous work often proposed a reddening excess due to dust to explain the discrepancy between the synthetic colours and the observed ones .",

    "[ colorsmixj_ewha ] case 1 ( upper panels ) b - v ( panel b ) shows that differences between solid and dashed lines are small , so that estimations based on this type of plot would be similar using the colours with or without emission lines .",
    "however this is not the case for the other colours ( panels a , c and d for u - b , v - r and r - i respectively ) for which we suggest that the colours including emission lines are redder ( for u - b and v - r ) or bluer ( for r - i ) than the ones synthesised without this contribution .",
    "a similar behaviour is found in case 2 ( lower four panels ) .    as in previous figures ,",

    "this is not the case for the models with the emission lines , in which we can find red colours and high values of ew(h@xmath0 ) in the range of several hundreds or even few thousands , at early ages , without the need for interpreting this as a dust excess .      in this section",
    "we test our models to see if they can reproduce the photometric observations from star forming regions where it is already proved that at least a young and an old stellar population exists there .",

    "we can see that neither of the two set of models can reproduce the observations . in fig  [ color_color_obs1 ] and and fig .",
    "[ color_color_obs2 ] , we can not find any solution for colours u - b ( panel a ) , b - v ( panel b ) , v - r ( panel c ) and r - i ( panel d ) , when data are available , and neither is it possible to find a population able to simultaneously fit the colours and the h@xmath0equivalent width .",
    "the presence of such an underlying old population is widely accepted in bcgs , as the case of iii zw107 and iii zw102 . although their low metallicity and the very young stellar populations led some time ago to the proposal that these systems could be suffering their first burst of star formation @xcite more recent observations point to these galaxies seem to be not as young as it was originally thought .",
    "photometric observations indicate that they host stellar populations , reaching in some cases a few gyr @xcite .",
    "there is now wide agreement about the existence of underlying populations with ages of several gyr in bcgs and/or hii galaxies .",
    "even the most metal - poor galaxy known , i zw18 , the best candidate to primordial galaxy , has started forming stars earlier than @xmath70 gyr old @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the fit of a mixed population to the observed data , might improve the result .",
    "therefore we have selected among all the mixed stellar populations models computed in our grid and described in the previous section , those ones whose colours and equivalent width ew ( h@xmath0 ) can fit the observations within the error bars . to do that we have performed a chi - square fit of our mixed models in which the metallicity of the young stellar population , zyoung , is equal to the estimated one by the emission lines as given before .",
    "the yellow region in each figure shows the results of this fit .",
    "these results represent all possible combinations of zold+age - old+age - young able to reproduce the data within errors .",

    "panel e ) shows that two of the observed regions have h@xmath0   luminosities larger than those of the plotted models .",
    "this is likely due to the fact that our grid does not include cluster masses larger than @xmath75 m@xmath4 .",
    "at least ( although obviously the interpretation would be different if other imf is used ) we can put a lower limit for the mass of these hii regions .",
    "similar to fig .",
    "[ color_color_obs1 ] we have plotted fig .  [ color_color_obs2 ] with our models and observed data of star - forming regions in iiizw102 .",
    "again , most of observational points can not be fit by the ssp .",
    "we represent the region of selected mixed models as yellow points as before .",
    "this region is not valid for all data and some observed parameters are not reproduced with our current set of models .",
    "perhaps larger f factors are necessary to fit these very red colours in regions where ew(h@xmath0 ) is still present , or maybe the averaged abundance @xmath76 is not representative for all hii regions .",
    "following the results of panel e ) , the young stellar population mass of these regions should be smaller that our lowest limit , 10@xmath30m@xmath4 .",
    "this would also explain the values of the observed radii also being smaller than the predicted ones .",
    "it is necessary to remain that the chi - square fit is performed using only the data of panels a ) to d ) , not e ) nor f ) .",
    "nevertheless , the two - population mixed model is also a simplification since some of the regions are not spatially resolved and can contain more than two stellar populations with different ages .",
    "it has to be noticed that the worse fitting found in the colours u - b and b - v is fully consistent with the strong dust absorption found in this galaxy , as reported by @xcite    fig .",
    "[ color_color_obs1 ] and fig .",
    "[ color_color_obs2 ] show that our models can fit real data of photometric observations of hii regions , obtaining the metallicity and the age for both the young and the old populations and reproducing several colours simultaneously when ssps can not do it .",
    "moreover , the inclusion of emission lines in the models is needed to reproduce simultaneously all the colours in the two selected galaxies .",
    "it has to be notice that the two galaxies have very different values of the metallicity , which has been spectroscopically confirmed by different papers in the literature .    finally , we plot in fig .  [ color_color_obs ]",
    "data obtained by @xcite for a sample of hii regions in external galaxies .",
    "each galaxy s regions are plotted with a different code as labelled in panel b ) .",
    "only two colours and the equivalent width ew(h@xmath0 ) are available for this sample . in this figure , we plot as an example the model with @xmath77 for the young stellar population and @xmath78 for the old one , with an age of 10gyr .",
    "different factors f are shown with lines of different colours as labelled in the plot .",
    "we see that most of data could need values of f in the range 100 @xmath79 1000 , with only some exceptional points out of the region defined by these two lines .",
    "we might perform a similar selection technique to see which models are the best ones to fit these data , or use a mean square error ( mse ) analysis to derive the most appropriate models for each galaxy or hii region , but this is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "what we want to show with this figure is that mixed population models including emission lines can reproduce the observations of star - forming regions , while ssps can not , and models without emission lines do not offer the same result , and ultimately result in a misinterpretation of the physical stellar population parameters .",
    "* we have calculated the same grid of magnitudes and colours as in paper i with the popstar code , but now incorporating the contribution from emission lines , using for that the intensities obtained in our paper ii , for a large grid of young stellar ionising clusters .",
    "we provide tables with uncontaminated and contaminated colours .",
    "* broadband filter magnitudes are contaminated by the emission lines coming from ionising nebulae surrounding young stellar clusters .",
    "this contamination modifies the magnitudes ( ranging from 0.2 to 1.5 mag depending on the filter ) in the visible and near - infrared bands .",
    "colours u - b , b - v , v - r and r - i are modified by a value between 0.2 and 0.8 mag depending on the colour and on the metallicity of the stellar population .",
    "similar results are found in sdss filters and should be found in other photometric systems . * the synthetic contaminated colours for ssps in the colour - colour diagrams fall outside the standard canonical sequence shown by the uncontaminated colours or those obtained for old stellar populations . in many cases",
    "they show orthogonal sequences to those ones .",
    "* we have also computed other photometric parameters , such as h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  luminosities , equivalent widths of h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  and radii of the corresponding hii regions . *",
    "the equivalent widths for h@xmath0and h@xmath1  do not depend only on the age .",
    "they also depend on the metallicity of the stellar population .",
    "the ew(h@xmath0 ) decreases with age until 5 - 7myr if z@xmath80 . for lower metallicities ,",
    "ewh@xmath0  maintains positive values until 15 - 18 myr .",
    "the same occurs with h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  luminosities , which have high values until @xmath81 myr for the lowest metallicities ( z@xmath82 ) . *",
    "the outer calculated radii of low metal hii regions are quite large compared with those observed at intermediate metallicities . since these regions are not present in the observational samples , and taking into account that they must show high h@xmath0  luminosities too , we need to consider the impact of observational selection effects that might be able to lead the production of biased hii region samples . *",
    "an evolutionary track in the plane r@xmath43-l(h@xmath0 ) shows that the radius of the region increases when the h@xmath0  luminosity decreases .",
    "however a positive correlation l(h@xmath83 arises when all stellar cluster masses and metallicities are drawn together , so the observed correlation and its dispersion may be explained by a mix of stellar clusters of different ages , metallicities and masses .",
    "* we have also computed a grid of models where a recent ionising burst is mixed with an underlying and older host stellar population in different proportions .",
    "we give magnitudes and colours for these mixed stellar populations . in some cases contaminated colours with a low contribution of an old stellar population are similar to the uncontaminated colours with a high proportion of old population .",
    "this is important when interpreting observations from regions where there exists an underlying stellar population , since the wrong ratio f will be estimated if the uncontaminated colours , instead the ones contaminated by emission lines , are used when comparing observational data and models to derive physical properties of the stellar populations .",
    "* other photometric parameters have also been given for each mix of stellar populations as before : h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  luminosities , equivalent widths for h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  and radii of the corresponding hii regions .",
    "this allows one to compare the observed radii of hii regions , their colours , and their equivalent widths of h@xmath0  with the models .",
    "we have checked with some test cases that our models can reproduce photometric observational data and that it is possible to find the best mix of stellar populations able to fit simultaneously several photometrical observations . *",
    "all these models have been computed at redshift zero but detailed models will be available soon for higher redshifts , taking into account their shift with @xmath84 and the contribution to the different standard filters in the visible and near - ir .",
