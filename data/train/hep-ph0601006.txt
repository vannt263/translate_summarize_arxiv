    "<S> we note that the new unitarity regime when scattering amplitude goes beyond the black disc limit ( antishadowing ) could help in the explanation of the regularities such as knee in the energy spectrum , existence of penetrating and long - flying particles and other features observed in the measurements of the extensive air showers which originate from cosmic particles interactions with the atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> +    the experimental and theoretical studies of cosmic rays are the important source of astrophysical information ( cf . e.g. @xcite ) and they simultaneously provide a window to the future results of accelerator studies of hadron interaction mechanism at the lhc .        </S>",
    "<S> [ ts : fig1 ]    it can happen that the investigations of cosmic rays will give us a clue that the hadron interaction and mechanism of particle generation is changing in the region of @xmath0 tev@xcite . indeed , the energy spectrum which follows simple power - like law @xmath1 changes its slope in this energy region and becomes steeper : index @xmath2 increases from @xmath3 to @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> it is important that the knee in the energy spectrum appears in the same energy region where the penetrating and long  flying particles also start to appear in the extensive air showers ( eas ) : the absorbtion length is also changing from @xmath5 @xmath6 to @xmath7 @xmath6 ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> there is also specific feature of the events at the energies beyond knee such as alignment cf . @xcite and the references for the earlier papers therein . </S>",
    "<S> the above phenomena were interpreted as a result of appearance of the new particles which have a small inelastic cross  </S>",
    "<S> section and/or small inelasticity . </S>",
    "<S> these new particles can be associated with a manifestation of the supersymmetry , quark  </S>",
    "<S> gluon plasma formation and other new mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> however , there is another possibility to treat those cosmic rays phenomena observed in eas as the manifestations of the new unitarity regime ( antishadow scattering mode ) at such energies @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> unitarity of the scattering matrix @xmath8 implies , in principle , an existence at high energies @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a threshold tev @xcite , which corresponds to the energy in the laboratory system @xmath11 @xmath12 . ] of the new scattering mode  antishadow one . </S>",
    "<S> it has been revealed in @xcite and described in some detail ( cf . @xcite and references therein ) and </S>",
    "<S> the most important feature of this mode is the self - damping of the inelastic channels contributions at small values of impact parameter  antishadowing . </S>",
    "<S> the antishadowing leads to @xmath13 at @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a probability of the absence of the inelastic interactions , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the elastic scattering @xmath17matrix .    </S>",
    "<S> self - damping of the inelastic channels leads to asymptotically dominating role of elastic scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the cross  section of inelastic processes rises with energy as @xmath18 , while elastic and total cross  sections behave asymptotically as @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the antishadow scattering mode could definitely be observed at the lhc energies and studies of the extensive air showers originated from the cosmic particles interactions with the atmosphere provide evidence for it as we will argue in what follows . </S>",
    "<S> starting at some threshold energy @xmath10 ( where amplitude reaches the black disk limit at @xmath20 ) , antishadowing can occur at higher energies in the limited region of impact parameters @xmath21 ( while at large impact parameters only shadow scattering mode can be realized ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the inelastic overlap function @xmath22 becomes peripheral when energy goes beyond @xmath23 ( fig.2 ) . at such energies the inelastic overlap function reaches its maximum value at @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the interaction radius , while the elastic scattering occurs at smaller values of impact parameter , i.e. @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 and unitarity condition in the impact parameter space is the following @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the elastic scattering amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> the quantity @xmath32 is a measure of the reaction peripherality . despite that the asymptotics for @xmath33 and @xmath34 are different , the quantities @xmath35 and @xmath36 have the same asymptotical energy dependence , proportional to @xmath19 .    </S>",
    "<S> so , beyond the transition energy range there are two regions in impact parameter space : the central region where self - damping of inelastic channels occurs ( antishadow scattering at @xmath37 ) and the peripheral region of shadow scattering at @xmath38 .     and maximum at @xmath24 with the energy increase . </S>",
    "<S> in the region of @xmath24 the complete absorbtion takes place , i.e. @xmath39.,width=340 ]    at the energies @xmath40 small impact parameter scattering is almost elastic one .    thus head  on colliding particles will provide appearance of penetrating long - flying component in the eas and such particles will spend only small part of their energy for the production of secondaries . </S>",
    "<S> the head - on collisions will lead to smaller number of secondary particle and it will provide faster decrease of the energy spectrum of cosmic rays , i.e. it will result in the appearance of the knee . </S>",
    "<S> this qualitative picture will be explained in more detail in what follows . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that this effect has a threshold in the energy dependence . </S>",
    "<S> it is also important to note that due to small probability of the sequential head - on collisions the number of events with penetrating particles also should be small . </S>",
    "<S> nontheless , such events have been observed in the experiments pamir @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> antishadowing leads to suppression of particle production at small impact parameters : @xmath41 i.e. multiplicity distribution @xmath42 and mean multiplicity @xmath43 in the impact parameter representation have no absorptive corrections , but peripherality of @xmath44 leads to suppression of particle production at small impact parameters and the main contribution to the integral multiplicity @xmath45 comes from the region of @xmath46 ( eq . ( [ mm ] ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> this would lead to the events with alignment observed in eas and also to the imbalance between orbital angular momentum in the initial and final states since particles in the final state will carry out large orbital angular momentum . to compensate this orbital momentum spins of secondary particles should become lined up , i.e. the spins of the produced particles should demonstrate significant correlations when the antishadow scattering mode appears @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the observed phenomena of alignment in eas @xcite and predicted spin correlations of final particles should have a common origin . </S>",
    "<S> the model estimate for the primary energy when these phenomena should appear is @xmath47 @xmath12  @xmath48 is the energy when the new unitarity regime starts to develop at small impact parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> the detected particle composition of the eas is closely related to the quantity known as gap survival probability . </S>",
    "<S> antishadowing leads to the nonmonotonous energy dependence of this quantity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the gap survival probability , namely the probability to keep away inelastic interactions which can result in filling up by hadrons the large rapidity gaps , reaches its minimal values at the tevatron highest energy and this is due to the fact that the scattering at this energy is very close to the black disk limit at @xmath20 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) .        [ fig4 ]    </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that its higher value means higher fraction for diffractive component and consequently the increasing of this component would result in the enhancement of the relative fraction of protons in the observed cosmic rays spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise , decreasing of this quantity will lead to increase of pionization component and consequently to the increasing number of muons observed as multi - muon events . </S>",
    "<S> experiment reveals that relative fraction of protons in cosmic rays also shows nonmonotonous energy dependence ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ) . to explain such dependence an additional component </S>",
    "<S> is introduced _ </S>",
    "<S> ad hoc _ at the energies above @xmath49 gev . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that account of the antishadowing makes an introduction of this _ ad hoc _ component unnecessary .    </S>",
    "<S> the inelasticity parameter @xmath50 , which is defined as ratio of the energy going to inelastic processes to the total energy , is important for the interpretation of the eas cascades developments . </S>",
    "<S> its energy dependence is not clear and number of models predict the decreasing energy dependence while other models insist on the increasing energy behaviour at high energies ( cf . e.g. @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> adopting simple ansatz of geometrical models </S>",
    "<S> where parameter of inelasticity is related to inelastic overlap function we can use the following equation for @xmath51 @xcite @xmath52 to get a qualitative knowledge on the inelasticity energy dependence . </S>",
    "<S> the estimation of inelasticity based on the particular model with antishadowing @xcite leads to increasing dependence of inelasticity with energy till @xmath53 gev . in this region inelasticity reaches maximum value @xmath54 , since @xmath55 and then starts to decrease at the energies where this ratio goes beyond the black disk limit @xmath56 </S>",
    "<S> . such qualitative nonmonotonous energy dependence of inelasticity is the result of transition to the antishadowing scattering regime . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution on the inelasticity is related to the distribution on the effective mass number , i.e. changes of @xmath57 are equivalent to changes of @xmath51 , and , for example , high - inelasticity primary proton interaction produces the same result at the ground level as the low - inelasticity primary interaction of the heavy nuclei @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the available experimental data on the average logarithm of the effective nuclear mass number , extracted from the energy dependence of the depth of eas maximum , have large error bars , but they also indicate a nonmonotonous energy dependence with the maximum in the region @xmath58 gev @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is also worth to note that the maximum in inelasticity energy dependence , when the pionization component is maximal , is correlated with the minimum of the relative component of protons in the eas , the following simple relation can be supposed @xmath59 i.e. the relative proton component in the detected eas should have a non - monotonic energy dependence and this is in agreement with the experimental analysis represented in fig .  4 .        [ pfrac ]    it should be noted that the behaviour of the ratio @xmath60 when it goes to unity at @xmath14 does not imply decreasing energy dependence of @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the inelastic cross  </S>",
    "<S> section @xmath34 increases monotonically and it grows as @xmath18 at @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> such a dependence of @xmath34 is in good agreement with the experimental data and , in particular , with the observed falling slope of the depth of shower maximum distribution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted numerical value of the inelastic cross - section is @xmath61 @xmath62 at the lhc energy @xmath63 @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> this value is also in a good agreement with the value for this quantity extracted from the proton - air inelastic cross - section @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this approach provides a reasonable description @xcite of the energy dependence of mean multiplicity and leads to its power - like growth with a small exponent .    </S>",
    "<S> the relation of the knee and other effects observed in the eas measurements with the modification of particle generation mechanism is under discussion since the time when they were discovered . </S>",
    "<S> we propose here one particular realization of this idea  an approach where the corresponding particle generation mechanism in eas is strongly affected by the unitarity effects and the energy region between the knee and the ankle coincides with the transition region to the scattering mode where antishadowing develops at small and then at moderate values of impact parameter , i.e. the energy spectrum of the primary cosmic particles @xmath65 is modulated by the significant variation of the scattering matrix @xmath17 in the energy region starting from about @xmath66 gev and finishing at about @xmath67 gev and this resulting in the regularities in the observed spectrum @xmath68 measured in the eas studies . below the energy @xmath69 and beyond the energy @xmath70 variation of scattering matrix is slow and the primary energy spectrum @xmath71 is almost not affected . </S>",
    "<S> it seems to be a rather natural explanation of the observed regularities in the eas measurements and has a close interrelation with the nonmonotonous energy dependence of gap survival probability and inelasticity . </S>",
    "<S> this hypothesis is based on the saturation of the unitarity and can be experimentally checked at the lhc @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the studies of the proton scattering in the forward region at the lhc will be very helpful for improving the interpretation of the results of the cosmic rays experiments . </S>"
