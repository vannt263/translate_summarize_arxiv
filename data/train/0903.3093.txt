    "the self - consistent mean - field method has been a standard approach to the description of ground state properties of atomic nuclei@xcite .",
    "it has been extensively applied also to hypernuclei@xcite , in which the mass number dependence of @xmath0 binding energy has been successfully reproduced , from a light nucleus @xmath2c to a heavy nucleus @xmath3pb .    in this contribution",
    ", we employ the self - consistent mean - field approach to discuss the structure and decay of @xmath0 hypernuclei . in the first part",
    ", we discuss the deformation of @xmath0 hypernuclei @xcite .",
    "it has been well known that many open - shell nuclei are deformed in the ground state . by allowing the rotational symmetry to be broken in the mean - field potential",
    ", the mean - field theory provides an intuitive and transparent view of the nuclear deformation @xcite .",
    "recently , the deformation property of @xmath0 hypernuclei has been explored in a broad mass region using the non - relativistic skyrme hartree - fock method @xcite . here",
    "we carry out a similar study using the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) method as an alternative choice of effective @xmath4 and @xmath5 interactions .    in the second part",
    ", we discuss the weak decay of neutron - rich @xmath0 hypernuclei .",
    "neutron - rich nuclei are one of the current topics in nuclear physics . in connection",
    "to hypernuclear physics , there have been discussions on an extension of neutron - drip line as a consequence of an additional @xmath0 particle @xcite .",
    "it has been well known that , in finite nuclei , the mesonic ( pionic ) decay , @xmath6 , is largely pauli - suppressed as the mass number increases , and the non - mesonic decay , @xmath7 , is the dominant decay mode @xcite .",
    "however , it has not been known well how the pionic decay mode is suppressed as the neutron number increases for a fixed value of proton number . here",
    "we address this question for relatively light neutron - rich hypernuclei using the non - relativistic skyrme hartree - fock method .",
    "let us first discuss the deformation of @xmath0 hypernuclei @xcite . in the rmf approach , nucleons and a @xmath0 particle",
    "are treated as structureless dirac particles , interacting through the exchange of virtual mesons , that is , the isoscalar scalar @xmath8 meson , the isoscalar vector @xmath9 meson , and the isovector vector @xmath10 meson .",
    "the photon field is also taken into account to describe the coulomb interaction between protons .",
    "the effective lagrangian for @xmath0 hypernuclei may be given as @xcite @xmath11\\psi_\\lambda , \\label{rmf}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the dirac spinor and the mass for the @xmath0 particle , respectively .",
    "notice that the @xmath0 particle couples only to the @xmath8 and @xmath9 mesons , as it is neutral and isoscalar .",
    "@xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ rmf ] ) is the standard rmf lagrangian for the nucleons .",
    "we solve the rmf lagrangian ( [ rmf ] ) in the mean field approximation .",
    "the variational principle leads to the dirac equations for the nucleons and the @xmath0 particle , and the klein - gordon equation for the mesons .",
    "we solve these equations iteratively until the self - consistency condition is achieved . for this purpose ,",
    "we modify the computer code rmfaxial @xcite to include the @xmath0 particle .",
    "the pairing correlation among the nucleons is also taken into account in the constant gap approximation .    with the self - consistent solution of the rmf equations ,",
    "we compute the intrinsic quadrupole moment of the hypernucleus , @xmath15\\,r^2y_{20}(\\hat{\\vec{r}}),\\ ] ] from which we estimate the quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath16 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "this behaviour can be understood if we consider a change in the mean - field potential .",
    "5 shows the single - particle potentials for @xmath17c .",
    "the occupied and the unoccupied levels are denoted by the dotted and the solid lines , respectively . as the number of neutron increases , the proton mean - field potential is deepened whereas the neutron mean - field potential becomes shallower .",
    "this is because of a strong neutron - proton interaction .",
    "as the proton single - particle potential well is deep , the number of bound ( unoccupied ) levels increases . at the same time , the momentum of the emitted pion increases .",
    "both of these facts result in the enhancement of pionic decay width in neutron - rich nuclei , as shown in fig .",
    "we have first used the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) theory to investigate quadrupole deformation of @xmath0 hypernuclei .",
    "we have shown that , while an addition of @xmath0 particle does not influence much the shape of many nuclei , @xmath1si makes an important exception .",
    "that is , we have demonstrated that the @xmath0 particle makes the shape of this nucleus change from oblate to spherical . in the second part",
    ", we investigated the pionic decay of neutron - rich @xmath0 hypernuclei .",
    "we have shown that the neutron mode is largely pauli - suppressed as the number of neutron increases , while the decay width for the proton mode increases . we have argued that this is because the proton mean - field potential is deepened in neutron - rich nuclei .",
