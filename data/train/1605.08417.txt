    "quantum magnetism  @xcite , since the invention of heisenberg model and later bethe s solution in 1931  @xcite , remains a very active research field with various fascinating phenomena emerging , such as quantum phase transitions  @xcite , spin liquids  @xcite , and topological order  @xcite , etc .",
    "the heisenberg model has been studied in higher dimensions and exhibits nel order for various spin magnitudes on various bi - partite lattices .",
    "the spin-3/2 heisenberg model on the hexagonal lattice is such an example .",
    "in contrast , affleck , kennedy , lieb and taski ( aklt ) constructed an exemplary spin-3/2 valence - bond solid ( vbs ) state on the hexagon lattice , which is the ground state of a quantum antiferromagnet whose hamiltonian is also invariant under spin rotation , and possesses a finite correlation length but no spontaneous magnetization  @xcite .",
    "such a vbs phase is an generalization of the 1d haldane phase to two dimensions , and is also of interest given recent development in symmetry - protected topological phases  @xcite .",
    "additionally , from the viewpoint of quantum computation , the spin-3/2 aklt state on the hexagonal lattice  @xcite , as well as other trivalent lattices  @xcite , has been shown to provide the necessary entanglement for implementing universal measurement - based quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "niggemann , klmper and zittartz ( nkz ) generalized the aklt hamiltonian to one family that is invariant under spin rotation about the z - axis  @xcite .",
    "the ground states of this family can be parameterized by a single parameter ( denoted by @xmath0 below ) that deforms the aklt state .",
    "they found that the system exhibits a quantum phase transition between the vbs and nel phases , as the parameter @xmath0 increases from the isotropic aklt point ( @xmath1 ) to large anisotropy @xmath0 .",
    "the transition can be obtained accurately by mapping to a classical eight - vertex model and agrees with their monte carlo study , yielding a critical point at @xmath2 . incidentally , a recent work by darmawan , brennen and bartlett showed that , as regards to quantum computation , in addition to the utility at the aklt point  @xcite , this family of deformed aklt states can be used as a universal resource for @xmath3 in the vbs phase up to the same vbs - nel transition  @xcite .    for small @xmath0 parameter ( @xmath4 ) ,",
    "the deformed family is less explored , and the classical model by nkz is no longer valid , so we are motivated to examine this regime further . when the parameter @xmath0 decreases from the aklt point and we find , via the numerical tensor - network methods , that there appears to be a berezinskii - kosterliz - thouless transition at @xmath5 from the vbs phase to an quantum xy - like phase .",
    "such a transition also occurs in the deformation of other types of aklt states with triplet - bond constructions ( more details below ) .",
    "in contrast , on other trivalent lattices , such as square - octagon , cross and star lattices , we do not find such an xy phase in the deformed spin-3/2 aklt models . on the star lattices , the deformed family of aklt states ( with the singlet - bond construction )",
    "remains in the same phase as the isotropic aklt state throughout the whole region of the parameter considered .",
    "moreover , for two triplet - bond generalizations , the triplet vbs phase is sandwiched between two ferromagnetic phases ( for large and small parameters , respectively ) , which are characterized by spontaneous magnetizations along different axes .",
    "the deformed aklt states on various trivalent lattices , therefore , provide a rich variety of phases .    for the various deformed aklt families",
    ", we also discuss whether they can be used for universal quantum computation .",
    "the situation at the exact aklt point was previously studied in refs .",

    "@xcite on other trivalent lattices . in particular , we find that the resourcefulness of the deformed aklt families , for all four types of bond states , persists ( from @xmath6 ) up to the transition of the vbs to the ordered phase on the square - octagon and cross lattices , extending the results of darmawan , brennen and bartlett on the hexagonal lattice  @xcite .",
    "the loss of the capability for universal quantum computation for these deformed aklt states is due to the growth of the size of an effective qubit to a macroscopic size , and this is consistent with the percolation of ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic domains at the transition .",

    "it turns out that it is particularly helpful to use the tensor network representation of the state and see the phase transition by tuning the parameter .",
    "in particular we will employ a renormalization scheme of the tensors , coined the tensor renormalization group ( trg ) , much in the spirit of the spin blocking scheme used in the coarse graining of the kadanoff real - space renormalization group ( rg ) approach .",

    "thus , the double tensor can be treated as a the diagonal vertices , with double indices reduced to only one index on each bond .",

    "the quantum computational universality requires the former to be microscopic but the latter to be macroscopic .",
    "we remark that even though the above discussions , strictly speaking , assume that the deformed aklt states are constructed from the singlet bond @xmath320 , as we shall be mostly concerned with the bi - partite lattices and as aklt states of different bond states can be transformed to one another by local unitary transformation , the argument applies to these other bond constructions as well .",

    "<S> affleck , kennedy , lieb and taski ( aklt ) constructed an exemplary spin-3/2 valence - bond solid ( vbs ) state on the hexagonal lattice , which is the ground state of an isotropic quantum antiferromagnet and possesses no spontaneous magnetization but finite correlation length . </S>",
    "<S> this is distinct from the nel ordered state of the spin-3/2 heisenberg model on the same lattice . </S>",
    "<S> niggemann , klmper and zittartz then generalized the aklt hamiltonian to one family invariant under spin rotation about the z - axis . </S>",
    "<S> the ground states of this family can be parameterized by a single parameter that deforms the aklt state , and this system exhibits a quantum phase transition between the vbs and nel phases , as the parameter increases from the aklt point to large anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the opposite regime when the parameter decreases from the aklt point and find that there appears to be a berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless - like transition from the vbs phase to an xy phase . </S>",
    "<S> such a transition also occurs in the deformation of other types of aklt states with triplet - bond constructions on the same lattice . </S>",
    "<S> however , we do not find such an xy - like phase in the deformed aklt models on other trivalent lattices , such as square - octagon , cross and star lattices . on the star lattice , </S>",
    "<S> the deformed family of aklt states remain in the same phase as the isotropic aklt state throughout the whole region of the parameter . </S>",
    "<S> however , for two triplet - bond generalizations , the triplet vbs phase is sandwiched between two ferromagnetic phases ( for large and small deformation parameters , respectively ) , which are characterized by spontaneous magnetizations along different axes . </S>",
    "<S> along the way , we also discuss how various deformed aklt states can be used for the purpose of universal quantum computation . </S>"
