    "the cross section for producing heavy quarks in proton - proton collisions at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) can be computed in qcd .",
    "calculations have been carried out at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "so far , most of the predictions for charm - quark jets have been done in the massive quark scheme or fixed - flavor - number scheme ( ffns ) in which charm quarks appear in the final state only and not as partons in the initial state , as for example in the zero - mass variable - flavor - number scheme ( zm - vfns ) .",
    "the treatment of the charm quark being massless is justified as long as the transverse momentum @xmath0 of the produced jets is large enough , i.e. for @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the charm - quark mass .",
    "in such a case , one might hope to obtain information on the charm content of the proton parton distribution function ( pdf ) by measuring cross sections in pp collisions for the production of charm jets at large @xmath0 .",
    "such a task has been pursued in connection with dijet photoproduction of charm jets by m. klasen and one of us in order to get information on the photon pdf @xcite . another way to investigate",
    "the charm pdfs is to measure , instead of charm jets , the production of charmed hadrons , as for example the various kinds of d mesons or charmed baryons .",
    "this has been considered in several publications on the production of d mesons in photoproduction and hadron - hadron collisions in the zm - vfns @xcite and the general - mass variable - flavor - number scheme ( gm - vfns ) @xcite .",
    "the gm - vfns incorporates finite charm - mass corrections taken from the ffns in order to improve the predictions at small and medium @xmath0s .",
    "this approach has already been used to predict single d - meson inclusive cross sections for various lhc experiments @xcite , which are found in good agreement with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "of course , these cross sections depend on the fragmentation functions for the fragmentation of the final state partons into the respective charmed mesons d or charmed baryons which are the result of fits to production cross sections at @xmath3 colliders .",
    "on the other hand , the charm - jet production cross sections do not depend on such fragmentation functions .",
    "thus we can expect to obtain complementary information on the charm pdfs to the charmed - hadron cross sections , independent of the fragmentation functions input .",
    "the only requirement , however , is that the selection of charmed jets in the measurement must correspond to the selection in the theoretical cross section calculations . in the next section",
    ", we shall describe the theoretical framework and outline the input in terms of pdfs for the initial state .",
    "section 3 contains our results for the charm - jet cross section . in this section ,",
    "we also show a comparison with the single - inclusive jet cross section measured by the cms collaboration at the lhc @xcite in order to demonstrate that our jet cross section routine agrees with the experimental data with no special flavor selection .",
    "similar data are also obtained by the atlas collaboration at the lhc @xcite .",
    "a summary and our conclusions are presented in section 4 .",
    "for our calculation , we rely on previous work on dijet production in the reaction @xmath4 @xcite , in which cross sections for inclusive one - jet and two - jet production up to nlo for both the direct and the resolved contributions are calculated ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "the predictions of this work have been tested by many experimental studies of the h1 and zeus collaboration at hera .",
    "the resolved part of this cross section routine can be used for pp collisions replacing the photon pdf by the proton pdf .",
    "recent comparisons of the tevatron and lhc jet data are usually performed with predictions of the nlojet++ routine @xcite within the framework of fastnlo @xcite .",
    "the routine @xcite contains quarks of all flavors and the gluon . for our purposes",
    ", it has been restricted to the case that at least one charm quark appears in the final state . in the initial state",
    "we have the contributions @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a light quark ( or antiquark ) , with the restriction that @xmath13 and @xmath14 in leading order ( lo ) and the corresponding contributions in nlo are removed , i.e. only terms like @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath17 respectively , are retained .",
    "in addition , there are also contributions with light quarks and gluons in the initial state , as for example @xmath18 and @xmath19 , as well as the corresponding nlo contributions .    for our predictions ,",
    "we employ various pdfs of the proton . for the inclusive jet cross section containing all flavors and to be compared with cms measurements @xcite",
    ", we use the cteq ct10 version @xcite as used in the cms publication @xcite with @xmath20 , i.e. we include all flavors up to including the bottom quark .",
    "the asymptotic scale parameter is @xmath21 gev corresponding to @xmath22 .",
    "we choose the renormalization scale @xmath23 and the factorization scale @xmath24 , where @xmath0 is the largest transverse momentum of the two ( or three ) final state jets . @xmath25 and @xmath26 are dimensionless scale factors , which are varied about their default values @xmath27 to be specified later . the center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "energies of the proton in all calculations are taken as @xmath28 tev , as for the data of cms @xcite .",
    "the bin size in @xmath0 is taken according to the cms publication @xcite and the rapidity interval is @xmath29 as given in one of the curves in @xcite . for the charm - jet cross sections , we concentrate our calculations on the large @xmath0 region , @xmath30 gev .",
    "the bin sizes in @xmath0 and two of the rapidity bins ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) for our charm - jet calculation are chosen in accordance with the cms publication for inclusive b - jet production @xcite since there are no data for inclusive c - jet production yet .",
    "in addition , we select as a third rapidity interval : @xmath33 is taken to be @xmath34 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath35 is calculated with @xmath34 as well , with the @xmath36 value corresponding to this @xmath37 value . in the theoretical calculations ,",
    "jets were reconstructed with the @xmath38-cluster algorithm in the longitudinally invariant inclusive mode @xcite .",
    "the measurements of the inclusive jet cross sections are done with the anti-@xmath38 jet clustering algorithm @xcite using as the distance parameter r=0.5 . this value for r",
    "is also applied for all the other calculations in this work . at @xmath39 ,",
    "the parton - level predictions from the @xmath38 and anti-@xmath38 algorithms are identical .",
    "first we show our prediction of @xmath40 for the @xmath41 cross section in the @xmath0 range @xmath42 gev and @xmath31 in @xmath0 bins as chosen by cms @xcite for their measurement .",
    "non - perturbative ( np ) corrections for hadronization and multiple parton interactions were estimated by cms @xcite and are published in the durham hepdata project @xcite .",
    "they are applied to our nlo perturbative qcd predictions . for low-@xmath0 jets ,",
    "the np corrections are as large as @xmath43 with a relative uncertainty of @xmath44 and for large-@xmath0 jets they are around @xmath45 with an error of @xmath46 .",
    "theoretical errors from the dependence on the choice of the renormalization scale @xmath47 and the factorization scale @xmath48 are determined by varying the scales according to the following combinations of @xmath25 and @xmath26 : ( 1/2,1/2 ) , ( 1/2,1 ) , ( 1,1/2 ) , ( 1,2 ) , ( 2,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) , and the largest up and down cross sections for these choices are taken as the scale variation .",
    "the default choice        is ( 1,1 ) with @xmath49 .",
    "these scale variations modify the prediction of the inclusive jet cross section at the lowest @xmath0 bin ( @xmath50 gev ) by @xmath51 , the medium @xmath0 bins ( @xmath52 gev ) by @xmath53 , ( @xmath54 gev ) by @xmath55 , and the two large @xmath0 bins ( @xmath56 gev ) by @xmath57 and bin ( @xmath58 gev ) by @xmath59 .",
    "the second and fourth value will be used later for estimates of charm - jet cross section errors .",
    "the corrected inclusive jet cross section including the theoretical error together with the cms data @xcite is presented in fig .",
    "1 . it shows the jet @xmath0 spectra between @xmath60 and @xmath61 gev .",
    "the agreement between data and the theoretical prediction is quite good and quite similar to the comparison shown in the cms paper @xcite .",
    "this reference also contains cross section data and a comparison with theory predictions for five more @xmath62 bins up to @xmath63 , which we have not calculated , exhibiting a similar good agreement between data and pqcd calculations .",
    "the cross section for inclusive charm - jet production is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "these cross sections are calculated in 12 @xmath0 bins for @xmath0 between @xmath64 gev and @xmath65 gev , using the cteq6.6 m pdf set @xcite .",
    "the widths of the bins have been chosen according to the cms publication for b - jet production @xcite , since so far c - jet production cross sections , which could guide us , have not been measured .",
    "the cross sections @xmath40 have been calculated for three rapidity bins : @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the first and second bin are taken as in @xcite , while the third @xmath62 bin was chosen for the purpose of comparing with cross sections with intrinsic charm pdfs to be considered later . in fig .  2 , the largest cross section as a function of @xmath0 appears for @xmath31 .",
    "the second largest is the one for @xmath68 , which is larger than the cross section for @xmath67 due to the bigger @xmath62-bin size .",
    "all cross sections in the three @xmath62 bins have a similar dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "the contribution of the c - jet to the full inclusive jet cross section lies between @xmath69 and @xmath70 , which is shown in fig .  3 , where we have plotted the ratio of the cross sections c - jet / inclusive jet for the three @xmath62 bins . for the @xmath62 bin : @xmath66 this ratio is slightly larger than for the other two @xmath62 bins .",
    "( for better visibility the ratios for @xmath67 and latexmath:[$0.0 \\leq    curves in fig",
    ".  2 and 3 are our main result .",
    "we see that the charm cross section in relation to the inclusive jet cross section is rather small .",
    "the plots in fig .  2 and fig .",
    "3 do not contain non - perturbative corrections for hadronization and multiple parton interactions .",
    "if they would be the same as in the inclusive jet cross sections , this would not change the ratio in fig .",
    "3 . in the considered @xmath0 range and",
    "@xmath31 these corrections are between @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( for increasing @xmath0 for the bins between @xmath64 gev and @xmath65 gev ) in the case of the inclusive jet cross sections @xcite .",
    "we expect them to be somewhat larger for c - jets than for inclusive jets .",
    "however , they have not been calculated yet .",
    "such np corrections could be estimated using pythia or herwig monte carlo programs as has been done in the inclusive jet case @xcite .",
    "another issue is the selection of the jet events on the experimental and the theoretical side . on the experimental side ,",
    "we assume that the c - jets are identified by finding the secondary decay vertex of the c - hadrons .",
    "this means that at least one charmed hadron is in the final state . the inclusive charm - jet cross section @xmath40 contains in addition also a gluon jet or light quark jet , although of course not a light - quark or b - jet instead of the c - jet . for example , already in lo the process @xmath74 leads to a c - jet and a gluon jet which both contribute to @xmath40 and similarly at nlo .        in all common proton pdfs",
    "the charm content is generated perturbatively , i.e. by assuming that at threshold near @xmath75 the pdf vanishes or is small and given by higher order contributions while at larger scales @xmath48 it is determined by evolution . since many decades",
    "it is argued that the charm pdf @xmath76 at @xmath77 could have a non - perturbative intrinsic charm contribution due to the fact that the charm mass is not really large compared to the qcd scale parameter @xmath36 . in recent work by the cteq collaboration",
    ", it was investigated how much of the intrinsic charm inside specified models is compatible with the global data samples for particular pdf parametrizations .",
    "such studies were performed starting from the parametrization cteq6.5 in @xcite , starting from cteq6.6 in @xcite and quite recently starting from cteqc10 in @xcite . in all three investigations @xcite ,",
    "two intrinsic charm models have been used : ( i ) a valence - like parton distribution ( bhps model ) and ( ii ) a sea - like parton distribution ( sea model ) .",
    "we select these two models bhps and sea , ( see @xcite for details ) with the constraint obtained in the cteq analysis @xcite .",
    "we prefer the corresponding cteq6.6c pdf in the program library lhapdf @xcite with a @xmath78 @xmath79         content at the scale @xmath80 gev for the bhps model and the sea model of high strength .",
    "these two particular models for intrinsic charm have been employed also for making predictions for the inclusive production of @xmath81 mesons at @xmath28 tev ( to be compared with lhc data ) in @xcite . from this work",
    "it is clear that the effect of intrinsic charm as parametrized by the valence - like model bhps increases with growing @xmath0 and rapidity . for the sea model sea the effect of intrinsic charm occurred uniformly for all @xmath0 and",
    "increased with increasing rapidity @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "we expect a similar behavior also for charm - jet production . in fig .  4 , we show our results for the relative enhancement of the @xmath0-distribution in the bins of @xmath82 considered previously . the results in fig .",
    "4 on the left - hand side are for the @xmath78 bhps model and in fig .  4 on the right - hand side for the high - strength sea model . for the bhps model",
    ", @xmath0 must be large enough to see an increase .",
    "for the largest @xmath62 bin : latexmath:[$2.2 \\leq    larger than two . in the case of the lowest @xmath62 bin : @xmath66 , the enhancement is smaller and increases less with growing @xmath0 . for the sea model plotted on the right - hand side of fig .  4",
    ", the enhancement is nearly independent of @xmath0 and @xmath62 bins and varies between 1.6 and 2.0 .",
    "hence , apart from the @xmath62 bin : @xmath66 , it is less than for the bhps model in the area of high @xmath0 . for better visibility the curves for @xmath67 and @xmath84",
    "are multiplied by factors 1.25 and 1.5 , respectively .",
    "compared to the inclusive d - meson cross section the increase seems to be similar if one considers the same @xmath0 and @xmath62 regions .",
    "it is clear that for larger @xmath62 it would be bigger .",
    "the question is though , whether these cross sections could be measured with sufficient accuracy .",
    "of course , these enhancements in the cross sections would be detectable only if they are much larger than any variation of the theoretical cross section due to scale variations .",
    "we have not calculated these scale variations for the charm - jet cross sections , but assume that they are very similar to the scale variation of the inclusive jet cross section for the same @xmath0 bin . at the largest @xmath0 bin in fig .",
    "4 ( 174 - 196 gev ) the scale variation is @xmath85 which is indeed small compared to the enhancement at this @xmath0 bin , except for the cross section for the @xmath31 bin in the case of the valence - like intrinsic charm ( see fig.4 left ) .",
    "we have calculated the inclusive charm - jet cross section at nlo of qcd in the zero - mass variable - flavor - number scheme , i.e. with active charm quarks in the proton , for @xmath86 collisions at @xmath28 tev . to test the presence of intrinsic charm contributions in the proton pdf , we have employed two pdf sets which are consistent with global pdf analysis results .",
    "we found that they lead to enhancements of the charm - jet cross section at large transverse momentum and rapidity , which might possibly be tested with present and future lhc jet production data .",
