    "the operator product expansion ( ope ) expresses ( nachtmann ) moments of hadronic structure functions in terms of wilson coefficients ( usually calculated in perturbation theory ) and nonperturbative hadronic matrix elements .",
    "the leading contribution in the deep ",
    "inelastic limit @xmath1 is provided by operators of twist 2 with corrections suppressed by powers of @xmath2 coming from operators of twist 4 and higher .",
    "schematically one finds for @xmath3 @xmath4 the reduced matrix elements @xmath5 of twist @xmath6 and spin @xmath7 depend on the renormalisation scale @xmath8 . whereas the corresponding wilson coefficients @xmath9 are dimensionless , the mass dimension of @xmath5 is @xmath10 . in the flavour  nonsinglet channel ,",
    "the twist2 operators are 2quark operators , @xmath11{0cm}{$d$}\\raisebox{1.7ex}{$\\leftrightarrow$}$_{\\!\\mu_2}$ } } \\cdots { \\mbox {    \\parbox[b]{0cm}{$d$}\\raisebox{1.7ex}{$\\leftrightarrow$}$_{\\!\\mu_n}$ } } \\psi \\,,\\ ] ] symmetrised in all indices and with trace terms subtracted .",
    "an important class of twist4 operators are 4quark operators .",
    "in particular , the twist4 , spin2 matrix element @xmath12 is given by @xmath13 in terms of the 4quark operator @xmath14 the quark field @xmath15 carries flavour , colour , and dirac indices , the matrices @xmath16 are the usual generators of colour su(3 ) , and the flavour matrix @xmath17 contains the quark charges : @xmath18 for two flavours .",
    "the wilson coefficient reads  @xcite @xmath19 .",
    "these expressions are to be compared with their twist2 counterparts : @xmath20 with the operator @xmath21{0cm}{$d$}\\raisebox{1.7ex}{$\\leftrightarrow$}$_{\\!\\nu}$ } } \\psi\\ ] ] and the wilson coefficient @xmath22 .",
    "the operators ( [ opt4 ] ) and ( [ opt2 ] ) transform identically under lorentz transformations , but ( [ opt4 ] ) has dimension 6 , wheras ( [ opt2 ] ) has only dimension 4 : 4quark operators will in general mix with 2quark operators of lower dimension .",
    "this fact complicates the investigation of 4quark operators , because the mixing with lower  dimensional operators can not be calculated reliably within perturbation theory . for the time being , we do not attempt a nonperturbative calculation of the renormalisation and mixing coefficients of 4quark operators .",
    "instead we restrict ourselves to cases where mixing with lower  dimensional operators is prohibited by flavour symmetry .    in the following we present monte carlo data from quenched simulations at @xmath0 with wilson fermions on a @xmath23 lattice . from now on all operators",
    "are written down in euclidean space .",
    "in the case of the pion , we consider the symmetry su(2)@xmath24 , i.e.  isospin symmetry .",
    "while 2quark operators can have at most isospin @xmath25 , there are 4quark operators with @xmath26 .",
    "such operators are protected from mixing with lower  dimensional operators and it makes sense to renormalise them perturbatively .",
    "therefore we study the @xmath26 pion structure function @xmath27 which is purely higher twist and receives no contributions from 2quark operators .    omitting dirac and colour matrices ,",
    "the flavour structure of the relevant operator in the ope is given by @xmath28 \\end{array}\\ ] ] up to contributions with @xmath29 .",
    "although this flavour structure excludes mixing with 2quark operators , mixing with other 4quark operators is still possible . for spin 2 , a basis of 4quark operators whose",
    "@xmath26 components are closed under renormalisation is given by the spin2 projections of @xmath30 together with the operators @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 which differ from the above by the omission of the colour matrices @xmath16 .",
    "one  loop results for the renormalisation coefficients are given in @xcite .",
    "these are to be combined with the bare matrix elements extrapolated to the chiral limit . expressing the matrix elements in terms of the pion decay constant @xmath34 we get  @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36mev in the real world .",
    "the order of magnitude of this result is reproduced by the vacuum insertion approximation , which yields an answer proportional to @xmath37 .",
    "for the first moment of @xmath38 we find @xmath39 except for very small values of @xmath40 this is considerably smaller than the leading twist2 contribution to the @xmath41 structure function computed in a quenched monte carlo simulation  @xcite : @xmath42 of course , the fact that the particular twist4 contribution ( [ pionres ] ) is rather small does not tell us that all other higher  twist contributions will be small as well .",
    "in the case of the proton it is more difficult to find 4quark operators that are safe from mixing with lower  dimensional operators : the expectation value of any @xmath26 operator in the proton vanishes .",
    "so we have to enlarge the flavour symmetry which we consider from su(2)@xmath24 to su(3)@xmath24 , i.e.  we assume three quarks of the same mass . correspondingly , the flavour structure of the operator in the ope is now @xmath43 whereas 2quark operators transform under su(3)@xmath24 according to @xmath44 , we have for 4quark operators : @xmath45 .",
    "4quark operators with @xmath29 , @xmath46 , and hypercharge @xmath47 from the @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 multiplets do not mix with 2quark operators and can be used in a proton expectation value , e.g.  the @xmath25 operator @xmath51 \\end{array}\\ ] ] belongs to the @xmath50 multiplet .",
    "analogously to the case of the pion , one can find linear combinations of the structure functions of the octet baryons ( @xmath52 , @xmath7 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) which project out the desired flavour component , e.g. @xmath56 @xmath57    the proton matrix elements are computed in the standard fashion from ratios of 3point functions @xmath58 over 2point functions @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) with suitable interpolating fields @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "for a general 4quark operator the 3point function @xmath58 consists of three types of contributions , which can be represented pictorially by the following diagrams    fd1    ( 60,40 )    fd2    ( 60,40 )     +    fd3    ( 60,40 )    it is precisely through contributions of the form of the first two diagrams that the mixing with lower  dimensional operators occurs .",
    "therefore these contributions cancel in the operators which we consider , and we are left with the contributions of the last type only .    as an example of our results we show in fig.[fig.chiex ] the chiral extrapolation of the bare proton matrix element of @xmath63 ( @xmath25 component in the @xmath50 representation of su(3)@xmath24 ) divided by the fourth power of the proton mass @xmath64 .",
    "it indicates the order of magnitude of all 4quark matrix elements that we have studied .",
    "after renormalisation this expression contributes to the reduced matrix element @xmath65 according to @xmath66 and we obtain for the lowest moment of @xmath38 in our special flavour channel @xmath67    in the proton the corresponding twist2 contribution is @xmath68 .",
    "once again , the twist4 correction is tiny .",
    "this may be compared with bag model estimates , which give numbers @xmath69 for the prefactor in ( [ nuclres ] ) , where @xmath70 is the bag constant  @xcite .",
    "let us finally compare in fig.[fig.comp ] the renormalised pion matrix elements @xmath71 with the corresponding renormalised proton matrix elements @xmath72 ( in lattice units )",
    ". in the operators we have set @xmath73 ( with traces subtracted ) .",
    "the normalisation of the pion and proton matrix elements is chosen such that the flavour structure @xmath74 appears with the factor 1 in both cases . in view of the fact that pion and proton are very different particles it is hardly surprising that the numbers do not show many similarities .",
    "contributions of higher twist to hadronic structure functions promise to challenge lattice qcd for a few more years . still , 4quark operators can give reasonable signals in present quenched monte carlo simulations . however , when the flavour structure is such that it prohibits mixing with lower  dimensional ( 2quark ) operators , the matrix elements turn out to be rather small .",
    "unfortunately , these flavour structures are somewhat exotic and not easily accessible to experiment .",
    "the investigation of physically more interesting flavour channels is of course desirable , but impossible without progress in nonperturbative renormalisation .",
    "it remains to be seen what will happen first : a measurement of structure functions in the above flavour channels or a reliable lattice calculation of twist4 matrix elements relevant for the proton or the pion .",
