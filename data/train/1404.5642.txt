    "in the early 1980s , joyce @xcite and matveev @xcite introduced an algebraic structure called _ quandles _ or _ distributive groupoids _ with connections to knot theory .",
    "in particular the quandle axioms can be understood as the conditions required by the reidemeister moves for labelings of the arcs in a knot diagram by elements of a quandle to correspond one to one before and after the move .",
    "associated to an oriented knot or link @xmath2 is a _ fundamental quandle _",
    "@xmath3 which determines the knot group as well as the peripheral subgroup and hence is a complete invariant of knots up to ambient homeomorphism . given a finite quandle @xmath0 , the set @xmath4 is a finite set ( provided @xmath2 is tame ) and its cardinality is a computable knot invariant known as the _ quandle counting invariant_. in @xcite the first _ enhancement _ of the quandle counting invariant , known as the _ quandle 2-cocycle _ invariant , was introduced .",
    "an enhancement is a stronger invariant which determines the counting invariant but distinguishes some knots or links which have the same counting invariant value .",
    "since then , numerous enhancements of the quandle counting invariant and its generalizations have been explored .",
    "each homomorphism @xmath5 can be identified with a labeling of the arcs in a diagram of @xmath2 with elements of @xmath0 ; in particular , enhancements of the counting invariant associated to a finite quandle @xmath0 can be understood as invariants of @xmath0-labeled knots .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a new enhancement of the quandle counting invariant defied via lie ideals in a lie algebra , analogous to the symplectic quandle enhancement defined in @xcite .",
    "our construction involves embedding a finite quandle @xmath0 in the quandle of units @xmath6 of the universal enveloping algebra @xmath7 of a lie algebra @xmath1 , then using the lie algebra structure to obtain an invariant signature for each quandle coloring of our knot or link @xmath8 .",
    "different embeddings of the same finite quandle into lie algebras in general yield different enhancements .",
    "we can think of the embedding @xmath9 as a kind of knotting analogous to embedding copies of @xmath10 into @xmath11 ; then these invariants are defined via pairs of `` knotted quandles '' philosophically similar to the approach to finite type invariants in @xcite , where a knot is compared to another `` knot '' via evaluation of a bilinear form .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ qb ]",
    "we review the basics of quandles and the quandle counting invariant , as well as some previously studied enhancements . in section [ l ]",
    "we introduce the lie ideal enhanced polynomial invariant or lie polynomial associated to lie algebra with finite quandle of units . in section [ ce ] we collect computations and examples of the new invariants , and in section [ q ] we conclude with some questions for future research .",
    "we begin with a definition ( see @xcite ) .    more generally ,",
    "if @xmath12 then we can define a quandle structure on @xmath13 by @xmath14 with an @xmath15 matrix @xmath16 with the properties that @xmath17 , each column is a permutation of @xmath13 , and @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "we call @xmath20 the _ quandle matrix _ of @xmath13 .    for each @xmath21 , define @xmath22 by @xmath23 . then quandle axiom ( ii ) says that @xmath24 is invertible for each @xmath25 ; in particular , the operation @xmath26 determines the operation @xmath27 .",
    "a subset @xmath28 of a quandle @xmath0 which is closed under @xmath26 is a _ subquandle _ of @xmath0 .",
    "a map @xmath29 between quandles @xmath0 and @xmath30 with operations @xmath26 and @xmath31 is a _ homomorphism of quandles _",
    "if for all @xmath32 we have @xmath33    the quandle axioms can be understood as algebraically encoding the reidemeister moves .",
    "more precisely , a _ quandle coloring _ of an oriented knot diagram @xmath8 by a quandle @xmath0 is an assignment of an element of @xmath0 to each arc in @xmath8 such that at each crossing , the result of an arc labeled @xmath34 crossing under and arc labeled @xmath25 from right to left is an arc labeled @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36 in particular , the quandle axioms are the conditions required to ensure that for each quandle coloring of a knot diagram before a move , there is a unique corresponding quandle coloring of the diagram after the move .",
    "@xmath37 @xmath38 then we have :     let @xmath0 be a finite quandle and @xmath2 an oriented knot or link .",
    "then the number @xmath39 of quandle colorings of a diagram of @xmath2 is invariant under reidemeister moves .    a quandle coloring of a knot or link @xmath2 by a quandle @xmath0 determines a unique homomorphism of quandles @xmath40 by assigning an image in @xmath0 to each generator of the fundamental quandle @xmath3",
    "; then the homomorphism condition requires that @xmath41 for each @xmath42 .",
    "in particular , an assignment of elements of @xmath0 to arcs in a diagram of @xmath2 determines a quandle homomorphism @xmath40 if and only if the crossing relations are satisfied at every crossing , and the homomorphism so determined is unique .",
    "the number of quandle colorings @xmath43 of a knot or link @xmath2 is called the _ quandle counting invariant _ of @xmath8 with coloring quandle @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath2 is tame and @xmath0 is finite , then @xmath43 is a positive integer greater than or equal to @xmath44 , since monochromatic colorings are always valid .",
    "now let @xmath45 be a an invariant of @xmath0-colored knot diagrams . instead of counting `` 1 '' for each element of @xmath46",
    ", we can collect @xmath47 values for each @xmath48 to obtain a multiset @xmath49 whose cardinality is the quandle counting invariant .",
    "we call such an invariant an _ enhancement _ of the counting invariant . especially for integer - valued enhancements ,",
    "we often replace the multiset with its generating function to get a polynomial invariant for ease of comparison .",
    "for instance , the multiset @xmath50 corresponds to the polynomial @xmath51 .",
    "let @xmath52 be a commutative ring , @xmath7 be an associative unital @xmath52-algebra and let @xmath1 be the associated lie algebra ( that is , @xmath1 is @xmath7 endowed with the lie bracket @xmath53=uv - vu$ ] ) .",
    "then for any integer @xmath54 , the group of units of @xmath7 , @xmath55 , is a quandle under the @xmath56-fold conjugation operation @xmath57\\ ] ] which we call the _",
    "@xmath56th quandle of units _ of @xmath1 , denoted @xmath58 . if @xmath1 is finite , then so is @xmath58 , though the converse is not necessarily true . if @xmath59 , we will write @xmath6 instead of @xmath60 .    in some cases",
    "this quandle of units coincides with symplectic quandles as defined in @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we have the following :    [ thm2 ]    for the symplectic quandle structure on @xmath61 we have @xmath62 where @xmath63 is antisymmetric .",
    "if @xmath64 is the same as the quandle action defining @xmath6 above , then we have @xmath65\\ ] ] and thus @xmath66\\vec{v}^{-1 } = \\vec{v}^{-1}(\\vec{u}\\vec{v}-\\vec{v}\\vec{u})\\vec{v}^{-1 } = \\vec{v}^{-1}{u}-\\vec{u}\\vec{v}^{-1 } = [ \\vec{v}^{-1},u].\\ ] ] now , we also have @xmath67 = [ v , u^{-1}]\\ ] ] and thus @xmath68 = [ v , u^{-1}]$ ] .    now ,",
    "if @xmath2 is a tame knot or link and @xmath69 is a finite subquandle of the quandle of units of a lie algebra @xmath1 , then set of quandle homomorphisms @xmath46 is a finite set which is unchanged by reidemeister moves . in particular",
    ", we can use the structure of @xmath1 to obtain invariant signatures of the quandle labelings of @xmath2 by @xmath0 to enhance the quandle counting invariant .    by construction",
    ", we have the following theorem :    for any lie algebra @xmath1 , the multiset @xmath70 and polynomial @xmath71 are link invariants .",
    "we can also define enhancements using the associative ideals @xmath72 in the enveloping algebra @xmath7 @xmath73 and @xmath74 and combine these to get a two - variable polynomial @xmath75",
    "in this section we collect a few examples of lie invariants and their computation .",
    "our computations use custom ` python ` code available for download from the second author s website at ` www.esotericka.org ` .",
    "in particular , the previous example implies the following :    let @xmath2 be a link of @xmath76 components and @xmath1 an abelian lie algebra over a field @xmath77 with trivial quandle of units @xmath6 of cardinality @xmath56 . then the lie polynomial",
    "is given by @xmath78 if @xmath79 or @xmath80 if @xmath81 is not finite .",
    "thus , to get nontrivial invariant values , we must ( unsurprisingly ) focus on non - abelian lie algebras .",
    "we close with a few questions and direction for future research .    in @xcite , it is noted that the exponential map satisfies the augmented rack identity , giving a lie algebra the structure of an augmented rack with augmentation group the associated lie group .",
    "what are sufficient conditions for the resulting rack to be a finite quandle ? in the case of infinite lie quandles , can lie ideals be used to enhance the topological version of the counting invariant defined in @xcite or to define power series - valued counting invariants and enhancements ?",
    "what are some other quandle structures on lie algebras ?"
