    "in martin gardner s october 1976 mathematical games column in _ scientific american _ , he introduced this combinatorial chessboard problem : what is the minimum number of counters that can be placed on an @xmath4 chessboard , no three in a line , such that adding one more counter on any vacant square will produce three in a line ?",
    "he dubbed the problem the _",

    "this placement is maximal , that is , any additional queen will create three in a line .",
    "the figure illustrates the corresponding ` three - in - a - line ' created when an additional queen , shown in a distinct shading , is placed in the fourth column and eighth row .",
    "this particular placement is also of minimum size ( where _ size _ of a placement is the number of queens in the placement ) , that is , there is no placement with eight or fewer queens meeting the requirements .",

    "theorem : main ] for @xmath7 , the answer to gardner s no-3-in - a - line problem is at least @xmath1 , except in the case when @xmath1 is congruent to @xmath2 modulo @xmath3 , in which case one less may suffice .",
    "we offer an elementary , ad hoc proof in the case of @xmath1 even ( the approach yields a lower bound of only @xmath8 when @xmath1 is odd ) .",
    "this proof , similar to an incomplete argument of john harris  @xcite , is provided in section  [ section : harrisproof ] .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ theorem : main ] for arbitrary @xmath1 ultimately relies on the nullstellensatz .",
    "hilbert s `` zero - locus theorem ''  @xcite is a foundational result that connects geometry and algebra . in  @xcite",
    ", alon leverages a special case of hilbert s theorem to prove a _ combinatorial nullstellensatz _ ( reproduced here as theorem  [ theorem : cn ] ) that is ideally suited for obtaining lower bounds on restricted - sum sets and other similar objects ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 9 ) ) .",
    "the proof we present in section  [ section : cnproof ] using the combinatorial nullstellensatz is inspired by a similar proof of alon and fredi  @xcite ; their proof gives a result about the number of hyperplanes needed to cover all but one of the vertices of the hypercube ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  6.3 ) ) .",
    "we believe that our proof serves as a nice illustrative application of the combinatorial nullstellensatz .",
    "we may arrive at lower bounds that are weaker than those promised by theorem [ theorem : main ] quite quickly .",
    "if we make the observation that each of the @xmath9 queens ` covers ' at most @xmath10 squares and each of the @xmath11 squares requires either two queens to ` cover ' it or one queen to occupy it , a lower bound of @xmath12 follows  @xcite .",
    "this last observation can be strengthened by noting that only a few queens can cover @xmath10 squares .",
    "however , any queen covers at ` worst ' @xmath13 squares , though still we could not push this line of argument to get us to @xmath1 .",
    "prior to our proof of theorem  [ theorem : main ] , we discuss some history of the problem drawn from gardner s notes and correspondence pertaining to his writing of the _ scientific american _",
    "column @xcite  this is done in section  [ section : history ] .",
    "section  [ section : cnproof ] , as mentioned above , presents a proof of theorem  [ theorem : main ] using the combinatorial nullstellensatz .",
    "we also offer a more elementary proof in section  [ section : harrisproof ] .",
    "gardner and some of his readers found good placements  a placement is _ good _ if it does not contain three queens in a line and loses this property upon the addition of a queen to an unoccupied square  via pencil - and - paper ; others conducted computer searches .",
    "we also conducted computer searches , though with computing power that is better than it was 35 years ago . collectively , these results are contained in table [ table:1 ] ; @xmath14 denotes the answer to gardner s no-3-in - a - line problem on an @xmath4 chessboard .",
    "a bold - faced entry in the second row indicates that an improvement was made to previous knowledge .",
    "theorem  [ theorem : main ] is not `` tight '' for small values of @xmath1 .",
    "the data suggest for @xmath1 odd and @xmath15 that we should have @xmath16 .",
    "our search for good placements was done via brute - force search . as such , and to illustrate the computational challenges involved , our program took around 900 3ghz - cpu hours to confirm that there is no good placement of @xmath17 queens on an @xmath18 chessboard .",
    "we estimate that the corresponding search for a @xmath19 chessboard using our program would require at least 70 thousand 3ghz - cpu hours .",
    ".@xmath14 , for small values of @xmath1 .",
    "brackets indicate lower and upper bounds . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in that october column ( and in an addendum @xcite to it ) , gardner gave a few results on the queens version .",
    "these included placements of queens on chessboards @xmath20 through @xmath21 , which provided upper bounds on this number .",
    "his archives also contain a good placement of @xmath22 queens on a @xmath23 chessboard  @xcite .",
    "gardner also stated that john harris of santa barbara , ca ( who , we later learned , was a frequent correspondent of gardner s ) was able to show that the minimum number of queens needed for an @xmath0 chessboard is at least @xmath1 , except when @xmath1 is congruent to 3 modulo 4 , in which case it could be one less .",
    "gardner did not supply harris argument .",
    "these results were the `` jumping off '' point of our investigations  mostly , we wondered what harris argument was .",
    "subsequent to obtaining our results that confirm and improve upon those of harris , we were able to obtain copies of gardner s notes and correspondences concerning this problem @xcite .",
    "these are a small fraction of the 60 linear feet ( ! ) of notes and correspondences archived at stanford university that pertain to his writing of the mathematical games column .",
    "( these materials were a gift to stanford by gardner in 2002 . )",
    "there are numerous carbon - copies of letters that gardner wrote to other mathematicians , as well as readers , and copies of letters they wrote to him about the problem .",
    "chronologically first is a letter , dated june 2 , 1975 , that gardner wrote to the world - renowned john h. conway . in it",
    ", he states that the problem occurred to him while considering a game of the mathematician stanislaw ulam ( though not the game that commonly goes by the name ulam s game )  the game had appeared in an earlier column .",
    "the game consists of taking turns `` putting a counter on an @xmath0 [ chessboard ] until one person wins by getting 3 in line , orthogonally or diagonally . '' in the weeks that followed were letters to and from bill sands ( then a ph.d",
    ". student at u. manitoba , now at u. calgary ) , who independently suggested the problem , and john harris , including one that sketches some ideas for the above - mentioned claim .",
    "subsequent letters from readers ( that appeared after the october 1976 column ) contained their best solutions to the problem for small chessboards ; some of gardner s notes do the same .    of course",
    ", the reader may be more aware of some related or similarly worded problems .",
    "gardner mentioned one of them in that month s column , the _ maximum no-3-in - a - line problem _ , that is , what is the maximum number of counters ( or queens ) one can place on an @xmath0 chessboard so that there are no three in a line ? here",
    "an easy upper bound of @xmath24 follows from the pigeonhole principle as each of the @xmath1 columns may contain at most @xmath25 counters  guy and kelly @xcite showed that one is ` unlikely ' to find any with more than @xmath26 queens  this was later corrected to @xmath27 queens ( see ( * ? ? ? *",
    "a000769 ) ) .",
    "another related problem is the _ queens domination problem_. in this problem , one asks for the minimum number of queens needed so that each square of the chessboard is either occupied or attacked .",
    "there are two versions of this problem , one where the queens are non - attacking and the other where this restriction is lifted , see @xcite and @xcite for some results .",
    "in this section we prove theorem  [ theorem : main ] using the combinatorial nullstellensatz .",
    "to begin , we give a brief discussion of the theorem to be applied and its statement .",
    "the fundamental theorem of algebra tells us that a degree-@xmath28 polynomial @xmath29 contained in a polynomial ring @xmath30 $ ] has at most @xmath28 zeros .",
    "said another way , for any set @xmath31 contained in @xmath32 of cardinality greater than @xmath28 , there is an element @xmath33 such that @xmath34 is nonzero .",
    "one may think of this as saying , either a polynomial is zero everywhere or it is zero in very few places .",
    "the following theorem , known as the combinatorial nullstellensatz , generalizes this fact to polynomials of several variables  it is due to alon ( * ? ? ? * theorem  1.2 ) .",
    "we may think of it as saying that a multivariable polynomial that is nt zero everywhere has a non - root in a box of large enough volume .    [",
    "theorem : cn][combinatorial nullstellensatz , theorem 1.2  @xcite ] let @xmath32 be an arbitrary field , and let @xmath35 be a polynomial in @xmath36 $ ]",
    ". suppose the degree @xmath37 of @xmath38 is @xmath39 , where each @xmath40 is a nonnegative integer , and suppose the coefficient of @xmath41 in @xmath38 is nonzero .",
    "then , if @xmath42 are subsets of @xmath32 with @xmath43 , there are @xmath44 so that @xmath45 .    so that we might precisely state our results , we introduce some definitions and notation .",
    "we consider the infinite square @xmath46-lattice as a _ chessboard _ and its vertices as _ squares _ of the chessboard .",
    "a _ board _",
    "@xmath47 is a finite subset of the chessboard .",
    "let @xmath48 denote the board @xmath49 \\times [ 1,n]$ ] .",
    "as we are interested in the queens version of the problem , the lines that we concern ourselves with have slope @xmath50 or @xmath51 and contain vertices of the lattice  so , throughout we use _ line _ to refer to a line of this type .",
    "any subset @xmath31 of the infinite square lattice may be considered a _ placement of queens _ , or _",
    "placement _ for short , by imagining a queen on each corresponding square of the chessboard .",
    "the _ size _ of a placement @xmath31 is its cardinality @xmath52 .",
    "we say that two queens of a placement @xmath53 _ define _ a line if they lie on the same row , column or diagonal .",
    "in such a way , the placement @xmath53 _ defines _ a set of lines , the set of lines defined by the pairs of @xmath53 .",
    "lastly , we call a placement _ good _ if does not contain @xmath2 queens in a line and loses this property upon the addition of a queen to an unoccupied square .    let @xmath54 denote the minimum size of a placement on @xmath48 such that there are no @xmath55 queens in a line and the placement loses this property upon the addition of a queen to an unoccupied square of @xmath48 . as indicated by our title , our focus is on @xmath56 .",
    "we warn the reader that the placements we seek need not have each queen of a placement on a line with another queen .",
    "see figure  [ fig : qprimeex ] for an example with @xmath57 .",
    "we first prove the result for @xmath58 , where @xmath55 is a nonnegative integer , as in this case the presentation is cleanest .",
    "we next establish the result for @xmath59 , and we omit the details for the other two cases as these are similar .",
    "proof of theorem  [ theorem : main ]    let @xmath60 , where @xmath55 is a positive integer .",
    "( the result is obvious for @xmath61 , i.e. , @xmath62 . )",
    "let @xmath53 be a good placement on @xmath48 with size @xmath63 .",
    "our proof will proceed by constructing a polynomial @xmath64 of total degree @xmath65 that vanishes on each square @xmath66 .",
    "we will then obtain a contradiction through a suitable application of the combinatorial nullstellensatz .",
    "we shall construct @xmath38 as a product of linear factors of three different types .",
    "the first type consists of the set of lines defined by @xmath67 .",
    "since the placement @xmath67 is good , every unoccupied square of @xmath48 is in the zero locus of at least one line of the first type .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : qprimeex ] , there may be some queens in @xmath67 not on any defining line .",
    "let @xmath68 denote the ( possibly empty ) subset of queens not collinear with any other queen in @xmath53 . for each @xmath69",
    "we define a new line that passes through the square occupied by @xmath70 . while we are free to choose any one of the four possible slopes for each line , it is most convenient to distribute the slopes as evenly as possible",
    ". hence we choose the slope of the @xmath71 line to be the @xmath72 element of @xmath73 , where @xmath74 .",
    "every occupied square is in the zero locus of at least one line of either of the first two types .    for each of the four possible slopes",
    "there are at most @xmath75 lines of that slope of the first type and at most @xmath76 lines of that slope of the second type .",
    "these quantities sum to at most @xmath77 . as necessary , define new , distinct lines ( of the third type ) in each of the four directions so that there are exactly @xmath77 lines of each slope among the three types .",
    "( the lines of the third type serve only to facilitate the application of the combinatorial nullstellensatz ; it is immaterial which squares they vanish on . )",
    "let @xmath78 be our set of @xmath65 lines and let @xmath79 be the equation in variables @xmath80 and @xmath81 defining @xmath82 .",
    "we then define @xmath83.\\ ] ] as desired , the polynomial @xmath84 for every @xmath66 as every unoccupied square is on a line of the first type and every occupied square is on a line of either the first or second type . by construction ,",
    "the total degree of @xmath38 is @xmath65 .",
    "if we group the factors in @xmath38 according to slope , we see that @xmath38 can be rewritten as @xmath85 for suitable constants @xmath86 . from equation   and the binomial theorem ,",
    "we conclude that the coefficient of the top - degree term @xmath87 is @xmath88 , i.e. , nonzero .",
    "we now apply theorem  [ theorem : cn ] to @xmath64 , where @xmath89 and @xmath90 , to obtain that there are @xmath91 such that @xmath92 .",
    "we have reached a contradiction .",
    "therefore , the result holds when @xmath1 is congruent to @xmath93 modulo @xmath3 .",
    "let us now consider @xmath59 , where @xmath55 is a positive integer .",
    "we proceed in a similar manner to the above .",
    "again , we consider a good placement on @xmath48 , this time of size @xmath94",
    ". similarly , let @xmath95 denote the size of @xmath96 , where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are integers with @xmath99 .",
    "as before , we define lines of the first type and the second type , distributing those of the second type as evenly as possible . for each possible slope ,",
    "the number of lines is at most @xmath100 for @xmath101 , we have @xmath102 .",
    "likewise , for @xmath103 and @xmath104 , we have @xmath102 . for these values",
    ", we proceed as before , adding more lines so that there are @xmath105 of each possible slope .",
    "we may now construct a polynomial of degree @xmath106 and see that the coefficient of the @xmath107 term is nonzero .",
    "as before , applying theorem  [ theorem : cn ] we reach a contradiction with @xmath108 and @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "we are left to consider the case where @xmath103 and @xmath111 , i.e. , @xmath112 . in the process of defining lines of the first type , since @xmath94 and @xmath112 we may have @xmath105 lines of each possible slope .",
    "we define one new line of the second type for the single queen in @xmath113 , giving it slope @xmath51 . finally , we add more lines as necessary so that there are precisely @xmath77 with slope @xmath51 and @xmath105 for each of the other three slopes .",
    "our polynomial has degree @xmath114 and we consider the following leading term with nonzero coefficient , @xmath115 .",
    "as before , applying theorem  [ theorem : cn ] we reach a contradiction with @xmath116 and @xmath110 .",
    "this completes the proof in this case .",
    "the cases of @xmath117 and @xmath118 follow in a similar manner and are left to the reader .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "we now present a second proof to theorem  [ theorem : main ] for the case @xmath1 is even and obtain a slightly weaker result when @xmath1 is odd by showing that one needs at least @xmath8 queens ; this proof is more elementary than the one given in section [ section : cnproof ] . while we arrived at it independently , many of the ideas are to be found in a june 7 , 1975 letter of john harris to martin gardner @xcite . in the case when @xmath119 , harris only claimed @xmath8 queens are required .",
    "a similar proof for the no - two - in - a - line problem can be found in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 8) .",
    "we may refer to a square of @xmath48 by the coordinates @xmath120 of its corresponding vertex .",
    "proof : the claim is easily checked for @xmath62 , so we assume @xmath121 .",
    "let @xmath53 be a good placement of size @xmath9 on @xmath48 .",
    "we distinguish between the lines of slope @xmath122 or @xmath51 defined by @xmath53 and those of slope @xmath123 . to this end ,",
    "set @xmath124 to be the set of squares left uncovered by a line of slope @xmath122 or @xmath51 and set @xmath125 to be those queens not involved in defining a line of slope @xmath122 or @xmath51 .",
    "( note that squares in @xmath126 may still be occupied by a queen in @xmath127 . )",

    "set @xmath137 to be the number of the @xmath133 that are nonempty .",
    "define @xmath138 and @xmath97 analogously for the sets @xmath134 .",
    "note that @xmath139 .",
    "in particular , @xmath140 or @xmath141 requires @xmath142 .",
    "we therefore assume for the rest of the proof that @xmath143 . without loss of generality",
    ", we may assume @xmath144 as otherwise we may rotate the placement by @xmath145 .",
