    "the analysis of the x - ray data from sgrs has in fact revealed that the decaying part of spectrum exhibits a number of oscillations with frequencies in the range of a few tenths of hz to a few hundreds hz , that agree reasonably well with the expected toroidal modes of the magnetar crust @xcite .",
    "for example , qpo frequencies around 18 , 26 , 30 , 92 , 150 , 625 , and 1840 hz were discovered in the outburst of sgr1806 - 20 , while qpo frequencies around 28 , 53 , 84 and 155 hz were detected for the outburst of sgr1900 + 14 .",
    "more recently , @xcite claimed the discovery of 84 , 103 and 648 hz qpos in the normal bursts of sgr1806 - 20 . besides providing the first evidence for oscillations in compact stars",
    ", these observations are very important because they motivate further study in neutron star oscillation modes as a powerful tool for probing the complex stellar interior .",
    "the attempts to explain the above qpo frequencies in sgrs by using the crust toroidal oscillations has produced a vast literature in a very short time @xcite .",
    "overall , all of these works have shown that an alfvn qpo model is a viable explanation for the observed qpos if a number of suitable conditions are met by the magnetic - field strength and geometry .",
    "additional observations are clearly needed to impose additional constraints on the different models . at the same time",
    ", a considerable effort has also been dedicated to the establishing how much of the vibrational modes excited in magnetar giant flares can lead to the excitation of @xmath1 modes and to the copious emission of gravitational waves . also in this case , the various works have pointed out that only a small fraction of the flare s energy is converted directly into the lowest order @xmath1 modes and that the corresponding gravitational - wave emission is small @xcite .",
    "crustal oscillations of nonrotating non - magnetized neutron stars have been studied in newtonian theory @xcite as well as in general relativity ( e.g. ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the study of the oscillations of magnetized and rotating relativistic stars is far from being trivial or fully solved . at least in principle ,",
    "in fact , it involves the solution of the coupled einstein - euler - maxwell equations , as well as a detailed modelling of the stellar structure via realistic equations of state . in practice ,",
    "however , the investigations have so far concentrated on two distinct but complementary approaches .",
    "the first one has focused on the study of the eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions of selected modes of magnetized neutron stars in general relativity ] .",
    "the second one , instead , has focused its attention on the properties of the electromagnetic fields from near the stellar surface up to the wave - zone .",
    "the work reported in this paper belongs to the second class of studies and concentrates on calculating explicit expressions for the electromagnetic fields generated by radial , toroidal and spheroidal oscillations of the stellar surface .",
    "a number of different motivations are behind this investigation .",
    "first , we intend to provide analytical expressions for the electric and magnetic fields produced by the most common modes of oscillation for a relativistic magnetized spherical star in vacuum , both in the vicinity of the star and far away from it . in this way",
    "we specialize the generic expressions for the vacuum electromagnetic fields produced by a relativistic magnetized spherical star presented in @xcite to the most common oscillation modes . secondly , we attempt to address an important issue in the asteroseismology of compact and magnetized relativistic stars , namely , the general - relativistic corrections on the dissipation mechanisms that are most efficient in damping the oscillations . because in a linear regime , these mechanisms are confined to either gravitational - wave or electromagnetic losses , here we compute and compare , within a general - relativistic framework , the energy losses as produced by the oscillations in the form of poynting fluxes , joule heating and by the gravitational - wave emission . in this way",
    ", we revisit and extend to a general - relativistic context the newtonian estimates of @xcite for the damping times of oscillating magnetized neutron stars due to electromagnetic radiation .",
    "overall , a number of factors , such as the type of mode , the magnetic - field strength and the compactness of the star , concur in determining what is the main damping mechanism of the oscillations .",
    "however , we have found that the following results are generically true for a typical neutron star with a dipolar magnetic field of @xmath5 : _ ( i ) _ the general - relativistic corrections to the electromagnetic fields lead to damping time - scales due to electromagnetic losses which are at least one order of magnitude smaller than their newtonian counterparts ; _ ( ii ) _ with the only exception of @xmath0 ( gravity ) modes , we find that @xmath1 ( fundamental ) , @xmath2 ( pressure ) , @xmath3 ( interface ) and @xmath4 ( shear ) modes are suppressed more efficiently by gravitational losses than by electromagnetic ones ; _ ( iii ) _ joule heating is not as an important damping mechanism in general relativity as it is in newtonian gravity .    the paper is organized according to the following plan : in section  [ em_nz ] we provide a detailed discussion of the electromagnetic fields produced by spheroidal and toroidal oscillations in the vicinity of the stellar surface ( i.e. ,  in the near zone ) , while the following section  [ em_wz ] is devoted to the calculation of the corresponding fields at a large distance from the star ( i.e. ,  in the wave zone ) . in both cases , we show that in the newtonian limit our solutions coincide with those obtained by @xcite . in section  [ oscilltn_damping ] we instead investigate the damping due to electromagnetic emission when the star is modelled as a relativistic polytrope with infinite conductivity , as well as the damping due to joule heating when the stellar matter has high but finite conductivity .",
    "the damping times are then compared with the corresponding damping times due to gravitational - wave emission . in spite of its general - relativistic amplification ,",
    "ohmic dissipation is shown to be almost insignificant because of the small relative motions of the stellar crust matter with respect to the field lines due to the high electric conductivity in neutron stars .",
    "finally , section  [ conclusions ] collects our results and discusses the prospects of future work .",
    "we use in this paper a system of units in which @xmath6 , a space - like signature @xmath7 and a spherical coordinate system @xmath8 .",
    "greek indices are taken to run from 0 to 3 , latin indices from 1 to 3 and we adopt the standard convention for the summation over repeated indices .",
    "we will indicate four - vectors with bold symbols ( e.g. ,  @xmath9 ) and three - vectors with an arrow ( e.g. ,  @xmath10 ) .",
    "the study of the electromagnetic fields produced by an oscillating and magnetized neutron star has a long history and a first comprehensive investigation was carried out by @xcite , who estimated the emission of electromagnetic radiation in the wave zone from nonradial pulsations of a neutron star with a strong dipolar magnetic field in vacuum , and who provided the first estimates of the electromagnetic damping within a newtonian description of gravity .",
    "subsequently , @xcite derived , again in newtonian gravity , exact analytical solutions for the vacuum electromagnetic fields around an oscillating neutron star with a dipolar surface magnetic field ( both in the near and wave zones ) , while @xcite completed a detailed analysis of various oscillation modes and computed the corresponding damping times . later on ,",
    "@xcite improved the results of @xcite with better estimates for the parameters of typical neutron stars , and has calculated the eigenfrequencies of the toroidal modes of a magnetar .    at about the same time , @xcite have pointed out another interesting aspect of oscillating magnetized stars and , in particular , that a neutron star with magnetic field @xmath11 and oscillating at a frequency @xmath12 will generate an electric field @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the characteristic ( linear ) amplitude of the oscillations .",
    "interestingly , such an electric field can be strong enough to pull charged particles from the surface and create a magnetosphere even in the absence of rotation .",
    "these results were first extended to the general - relativistic context for a relativistic spherical nonrotating neutron star by @xcite . in @xcite , instead , it has been shown that the electromagnetic energy losses from the polar cap region of a rotating neutron star can be significantly enhanced if oscillations are also present , and , for the mode spherical - harmonics indices @xmath15 , such electromagnetic losses are a factor of @xmath16 larger than the rotational energy losses , even for a velocity oscillation amplitude at the star surface as small as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the angular velocity and the radius of the neutron star , respectively . in @xcite , on the other hand , the conditions for radio emission in magnetars have been considered and it has been found that , when oscillations of the magnetar are taken into account , the radio emission from the magnetosphere is generally favoured . indeed , the major effect of the oscillations is to amplify the electric potential in the polar cap region of the magnetar magnetosphere .    in @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) , we have derived exact analytical expressions for the interior and exterior electromagnetic fields in a perfectly conducting relativistic star , expressing them in terms of generic velocity and magnetic fields .",
    "starting from that work , we here specialize those expressions to the most common modes of oscillations . for simplicity",
    "we will assume star to be in vacuum and refer the discussion of the case in which a magnetosphere is present to the works of .    because our analysis is essentially analytical , we simplify the treatment by considering separately the electromagnetic fields in the vicinity of the stellar surface , i.e. ,  in the near zone , where they are almost stationary , and in regions far away from the surface , i.e. ,  in the wave zone , where they assume the properties of electromagnetic radiation .",
    "in doing this we will assume the space - time to be that of a spherical relativistic star of mass @xmath20 with a line element that in a spherical coordinate system @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 the portion of the space - time exterior to the star ( i.e. ,  for @xmath23 ) is simply given by the schwarzschild solution with @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and where @xmath26 is the redshift at the stellar surface .    in what follows",
    ", we will first discuss the generic form of the magnetic and electric fields in the near zone and then illustrate the expressions they assume in the case of radial , spheroidal and toroidal oscillations , respectively .",
    "we will then present the generic expressions for the perturbed magnetic and electric fields , and , subsequently proceed to providing the corresponding expressions for most common modes of oscillations .",
    "as shown in paper i , given a background magnetic field decomposed in terms of spherical harmonics [ see equations 5557 of paper i ] , it is possible to express the time dependence of a linear perturbation in the magnetic field components @xmath27 in terms of new functions , @xmath28 , which are linear superposition of the background ones . as a result , according to equations 6769 of paper i , when a generic velocity perturbation of the type @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( where @xmath31 is the oscillation three - velocity of the conducting stellar medium at the stellar surface ) is introduced over a background dipolar magnetic field ( i.e. ,  with @xmath32 ) , the complete expressions for the newly generated magnetic - field components are given by the real parts of the following complex expressions @xmath33",

    "when modelled as having a fluid core , a solid crust , and a thin surface fluid ocean , neutron stars are capable of sustaining a broad variety of normal modes of oscillation . for any star , there are two general categories of non - radial oscillations : spheroidal ( or polar ) modes and toroidal ( or axial ) modes .",
    "spheroidal modes , in particular , include several subclasses : the @xmath2 , @xmath1 , and @xmath0 modes , which are well known from conventional stellar pulsation theory , but also @xmath4 and @xmath3 modes , which result from crustal elasticity and play a particularly important role in neutron stars .",
    "@xmath2 modes have pressure gradients as the main restoring force .",
    "the eigenfunctions of a @xmath2 mode with quantum number @xmath78 has @xmath78 nodes and , as @xmath78 increases , the frequency increases and the wavelength becomes smaller . in the limit of short wavelengths ,",
    "these modes represent simple acoustic waves travelling in the star . in the same limit ,",
    "the frequency of the mode will tend to infinity . for a canonical neutron star ,",
    "i.e. ,  a neutron star with mass @xmath79 and radius @xmath80 , the typical frequency of the lowest order @xmath2-mode is a few @xmath81 and are roughly proportional to the average rest - mass density .",
    "@xmath0 , on the other hand , modes have a buoyancy force ( produced , for instance , by gradients in temperature , composition or density ) as the main restoring force .",
    "there are two groups of @xmath0 modes : the core @xmath0 modes , which are displacements confined almost completely to the fluid core , and the surface @xmath0 modes , which are limited primarily to the thin fluid layer overlaying the crust .",
    "the core @xmath0 modes have typical frequencies of @xmath82 , while the surface @xmath0 modes have a typical frequency of @xmath83 .",
    "the @xmath0-mode frequencies are roughly proportional to the internal temperature .",
    "@xmath1 modes have a character which is intermediate between those of @xmath2- and @xmath0 modes and are also referred to as the fundamental modes of oscillation . for each @xmath68 , the frequency of this mode",
    "is between the lowest order @xmath0-mode ( i.e. ,  the highest frequency @xmath0-mode ) and the lowest order @xmath2-mode ( i.e. ,  the lowest frequency @xmath2-mode ) .",

    "@xmath4 modes are essentially normal modes of shear waves in the solid neutron star crust .",

    "waves can also propagate on the solid - fluid ( crust - core ) interface , and the normal modes corresponding to such waves are the interface , or @xmath3 modes ; these modes resemble acoustic waves scattered off a hard sphere and do not induce significant fluid motion .",
    "the frequencies of these modes depend strongly on the local density and temperature at the interface , but are normally with frequencies of a few khz or higher .",
    "finally , toroidal modes are modes that , unsurprisingly , have eigenfunctions described by purely toroidal ( axial ) functions and hence do not have radial displacements .",
    "@xmath87 modes , in particular , are a well - known member of this class of modes and have the coriolis force as restoring force ; in this respect , however , @xmath87 modes represent more an exception than a rule .",
    "toroidal modes ( and hence @xmath87 modes ) are , in fact , part of a larger class of modes having the coriolis force as the main restoring force . such modes are called inertial modes and have eigenfunctions with a mixed spheroidal and toroidal nature , approximately of the same magnitude , at least to first order in the slow - rotation expansion . in this respect ,",
    "@xmath87 modes can be seen as inertial modes with purely toroidal eigenfunctions .",
    "the velocity eigenfunctions in the case of toroidal modes have very simple expressions and the perturbations in the density and pressure appear at orders higher than the first one in the slow - rotation approximation .",
    "we can now start our specialization of the general expressions presented above by first considering the case of spheroidal oscillations , where the euler velocity field is given by [ see , for example , equation 13.60 of @xcite ] @xmath88 with @xmath12 being the real part of the oscillation frequency , while @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the radial eigenfunctions .",

    "<S> an important issue in the asteroseismology of compact and magnetized stars is the determination of the dissipation mechanism which is most efficient in damping the oscillations when these are produced . in a linear regime and for low - multipolarity modes these mechanisms </S>",

    "<S> we here consider the latter and compute the energy losses in the form of poynting fluxes , joule heating and ohmic dissipation in a relativistic oscillating spherical star with a dipolar magnetic field in vacuum . while this approach is not particularly realistic for rapidly rotating stars , it has the advantage that it is fully analytic and that it provides expressions for the electric and magnetic fields produced by the most common modes of oscillation both in the vicinity of the star and far away from it . in this way </S>",
    "<S> we revisit and extend to a relativistic context the classical estimates of mcdermott et al . </S>",
    "<S> overall , we find that general - relativistic corrections lead to electromagnetic damping time - scales that are at least one order of magnitude smaller than in newtonian gravity . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , with the only exception of @xmath0 ( gravity ) modes , we find that @xmath1 ( fundamental ) , @xmath2 ( pressure ) , @xmath3 ( interface ) and @xmath4 ( shear ) modes are suppressed more efficiently by gravitational losses than by electromagnetic ones .    </S>",
