    "according to the standard thin disk theory , the radiation pressure dominated inner region of a thin disk is both thermally and viscously unstable when the eddington - scaled mass accretion rate is larger than a critical value @xcite , which corresponds to a few percent of the eddington luminosity .",
    "however , the high / soft state of x - ray binaries appears quite stable on observation .",
    "@xcite found that black hole x - ray binaries with luminosities ranging from @xmath10 to @xmath11 @xmath12 show little variability , which obviously conflicts with the accretion disk theory .",
    "only one superluminous x - ray binary , grs 1915 + 105 , was found to possess the limit - cycle light curve expected to be produced by thermal - viscous instability over the course of decades @xcite .",
    "the variability of grs 1915 + 105 was inferred to be related to its high luminosity @xcite .",
    "but recently , @xcite reported another source , igr j17091 - 3624 , that seems to show variability similar to that of grs 1915 + 105 at lower luminosity , which suggests that there may be other variables associated with limit - cycle behavior in x - ray binaries .",
    "although the analogous limit - cycle in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is hard to observe directly due to its long timescale , some intermittent activity in young radio galaxies has been ascribed to thermal instability in the disk @xcite .",
    "there are mainly two processes that can change the theoretical results .",
    "firstly , if the disk viscous stress is proportional to the gas pressure instead of the total pressure , the disk will be stable @xcite .",
    "but shearing box radiation - mhd simulations by @xcite suggested that the stress scales approximately with the total pressure .",
    "simultaneously , the lightman - eardley viscous instability was also confirmed . the second method to eliminate",
    "the instability is to make the disk cooler , thus increasing the relative importance of gas pressure compared to radiation pressure .",
    "@xcite found that the disk would be stable if most of the gravitational energy released in the disk were transported to the corona .",
    "convective cooling has been suggested as a stabilizing factor @xcite , although later research showed that it probably has a minor effect on disk stability .",
    "turbulence , instead of convection , has also been suggested to play a key role in increasing the critical accretion rate @xcite . another possible mechanism to cool the disk relies on magnetic pressure to provide part of the vertical hydrodynamical support @xcite .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the time delay between the turbulent stress and total pressure of the disk can also make the disk stable . but",
    "@xcite , using the same code , found that the disk still runs away once they adopt a large enough horizontal shearing box size .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate the thermal stability of a thin disk with winds .",
    "strong winds driven by a large - scale magnetic field can take away most of the gravitational energy released in the disk , thereby reducing the disk temperature considerably @xcite .",
    "thus , disk winds can help to cool the disk and make the disk stable . in this work",
    "we assume the existence of a large - scale magnetic field threading the disk ; how this field is established remains an open question .",
    "the formation of large - scale field in a thin disk seems to be difficult due to its fast diffusive speed @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that the advection timescale can become smaller than the diffusion timescale in the presence of winds , thus the field can be effectively dragged inwards from the outer region even for a thin disk .",
    "we consider the advection and diffusion time - scales of the magnetic field based on this work in section [ fields ] .",
    "we adopt the model of a relativistic thin disk with magnetically driven outflows / jets around a kerr black hole .",
    "the basic equations are basically the same as in @xcite , see also @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the metric around the black hole reads ( geometrical units @xmath13 are adopted ) : @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the mass of the black hole , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the angular momentum and specific angular momentum of the black hole , respectively , and @xmath22 is the dragging angular velocity of the metric .",
    "the steady state continuity equation is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the radial velocity of the accretion flow and @xmath25 is the surface density .",
    "both viscous and magnetic torques can transfer the angular momentum of the accretion flow . in this work ,",
    "we consider the contribution to the radial velocity from both of them .",
    "the lorentz factor @xmath26 of the rotational velocity @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the angular velocity .",
    "the mass loss rate @xmath32 from unit surface area of the accretion disk can be obtained from @xmath33 @xcite , where @xmath34 is the dimensionless mass loading parameter of the outflow @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field is @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the toroidal and poloidal component of the fields , and @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the radial and vertical component of the fields , respectively .",
    "the inclination angle of field lines with respect to the mid - plane of the disk is required to be less than 60 degrees in order to launch jets from a keplerian cold disk @xcite .",
    "we simply adopt 60 degrees in this work .",
    "the magnetic torque @xmath40 can also be written as @xmath41 ( using the cold approximation of weber - davis model , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , implying that @xmath34 is @xmath42 for @xmath43 .",
    "the mass loss rate is very small and can be neglected in this case .",
    "but when @xmath44 , @xmath34 is @xmath45 and the mass loss rate is important .",
    "on the other hand , the mass loss rate is unimportant for @xmath46 , although @xmath34 is @xmath47 , because the poloidal fields decrease by an order of magnitude . thus , the results for @xmath46 are qualitatively the same as those for @xmath43 ( see figs .",
    "[ f2 ] , [ f3 ] for details ) .",
    "we calculate the mass loss rate @xmath32 only when @xmath44 is adopted .",
    "the radial momentum equation is @xmath48 where we have neglected the radial pressure force .",
    "the keplerian angular velocities of the prograde ( @xmath49 ) and retrograde ( @xmath50 ) motions are @xmath51 and the radial magnetic force per unit mass is given by @xmath52    the angular momentum equation is @xmath53 where the angular momentum of the accretion flow @xmath54 is @xmath55 and the height - integrated viscous tensor is @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the shakura - sunyaev viscosity parameter . the height - integrated pressure @xmath58 , where the total pressure @xmath59 ; @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the gas pressure , radiation pressure and magnetic pressure , respectively .",
    "the scale height @xmath62 of the accretion disk is given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the sound speed of the gas in the disk .",
    "the magnetic torque exerted on the accretion flow due to the outflows / jets is @xmath65    the energy equation is @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the viscosity coefficient , @xmath68 in @xmath57-viscosity , and @xmath69 is the temperature of the gas at the disk midplane @xcite .",
    "the opacity @xmath70 of the gas is given by @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the electron scattering opacity and free - free opacity , respectively .",
    "in order to understand thin disk with winds better , we analyze the dynamical structure of thin disk using the approximations of @xcite .",
    "the basic equations are as follows in a paczy@xmath74ski - wiita potential @xcite : @xmath75    @xmath76    @xmath77    @xmath78    where the keplerian angular velocity @xmath79 and @xmath80 is the height - integrated viscous stress of the disk .    for simplicity",
    ", we adopt @xmath43 in this subsection in order to ignore the mass loss rate term in the continuity equation .",
    "thus , the parameter @xmath81 can be written as @xmath82 . in the momentum equation ( [ momentum2 ] ) , the magnetic force @xmath83 , which is about @xmath84 smaller than @xmath85 and can be negligible even when @xmath81 is far smaller than @xmath86 .",
    "so the momentum equation can be rewritten as : @xmath87    the magnetic torque will dominate the transportation of gas angular momentum if the magnetic field is strong enough . with @xmath88 , the angular momentum equation ( [ angular2 ] )",
    "can be rewritten as : @xmath89 where the magnetic torque is @xmath90 for @xmath43 .    using equation ( [ momentum3 ] ) , energy equation ( [ energy2 ] )",
    "can be rewritten : @xmath91      we consider a gas pressure dominated outer disk with @xmath92 and @xmath93 first .",
    "the opacity is @xmath94 and the total pressure is @xmath95 , where @xmath96 . with @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath25 , the energy equation ( [ energy3 ] ) can be written as : @xmath99    thus we get @xmath100 and the total pressure @xmath101 assuming that the magnetic torque is responsible for all of the angular momentum transport , the mass accretion rate @xmath102 is @xmath103 @xmath104    consider a perturbation that slightly increases the surface density @xmath105 at radius @xmath106 .",
    "the denser gas will at least partially concentrate the poloidal magnetic flux , leading to an increase of field strength .",
    "thus , @xmath81 must be a function of @xmath105 instead of a constant .",
    "we assume @xmath107 in this work , where @xmath108 and @xmath109 are the initial field strength and surface density , respectively , and @xmath110 is adopted . the parameter @xmath111 is defined as @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the diffusion and advection timescales of the field , respectively , and @xmath115 is the inclination of field to the horizontal plane ( see section [ fields ] for details ) . here",
    "the radial velocity @xmath24 comes from both the viscous and magnetic torques .",
    "when the diffusion timescale is far smaller than the advection timescale of the field ( @xmath116 ) , the field strength will be a constant and @xmath117 .",
    "but if @xmath118 , all the flux will be advected inwards effectively and the magnetic flux ( @xmath119 ) will be a constant , which corresponds to @xmath120 .",
    "such a case would apply , for example , if the magnetic torque were entirely responsible for the radial velocity .",
    "if @xmath121 , @xmath81 is given by @xmath122    combining with equation ( [ msigma ] ) , the resulting mass accretion rate ( ignoring viscous stresses ) can be written as @xmath123 when @xmath121 .      for a radiation pressure dominated inner disk , the radiation pressure @xmath124 and @xmath93 . the total pressure @xmath125 , where @xmath126 . the energy equation ( [ energy3 ]",

    "it seems that the whole disk should be very stable because both the gas and radiation dominated disk regions share the same positive slope @xmath132 .",
    "but actually , this solution of a radiation dominated inner disk with inflow driven by magnetic torque is hard to realize for the reason that the viscous torque ( @xmath133 ) is comparable to or even larger than the magnetic torque [ @xmath134 when the accretion rate is close to the eddington accretion rate ( fig .",
    "so the premise of magnetic torque dominating is no longer correct .",
    "the real case is that both viscous and magnetic torques will exist in the disk and the slope of the @xmath131 curve in the radiation pressure dominated region is between @xmath132 ( magnetic torque dominated ) and @xmath135 ( no magnetic field ) ( see figs .",

    "similarly , we can gradually obtain the properties of the whole accretion disk from @xmath151 to the outer radius @xmath152 .",

    "but a somewhat stronger ( but still weak ) field ( @xmath7 or @xmath8 ) is required to make the disk stable when @xmath5 or @xmath6 is adopted . the slope for a gas pressure dominated disk is found to be steeper when the field is stronger ( which means larger @xmath111 ) , which is roughly consistent with our analytical results ( @xmath159 ) .",

    "[ f4 ] and [ f5 ] .",
    "it is found that the accretion disk around a rapidly spinning black hole has a lower instability threshold at @xmath157 ( fig .",

    "the large - scale magnetic field threading the accretion disk plays a key role in the formation of winds and jets .",
    "however , how the large - scale field can be constructed is still an open issue .",
    "a promising way is that there is large - scale magnetic field at the outer boundary of the disk and the field may be dragged into the inner disk through the accretion of gas . whether or not the field can be effectively advected depends on the balance between the advection timescale @xmath114 and the diffusion timescale @xmath113 of the field . for a geometrically thick disk ( @xmath168 ) ,",
    "the large - scale field can probably be advected inwards due to its fast radial advection velocity @xcite .",
    "but the diffusive process dominates for a standard thin disk ( @xmath169 ) so the advection of the field may be very ineffective @xcite .",
    "there are several factors that may affect the formation of the large - scale field in a thin disk .",
    "for example , the diffusive process will be suppressed by the presence of strong magnetic field @xcite or the advection process can be accelerated by the external torque induced by the wind .",
    "@xcite found that even for a moderately weak field , the wind can significantly improve the efficiency of advection by taking away angular momentum from the disk , which results in the increase of the radial velocity . in this section",
    ", we extend the research of @xcite by studying the timescales of advection and diffusion in the whole disk .",
    "the advection and diffusion timescales are    @xmath170    and @xmath171 respectively @xcite , where @xmath9 is magnetic diffusivity .",
    "@xmath172 is calculated with @xmath173 when the magnetic field is absent . according to recent mhd simulations , the magnetic prandtl number @xmath174 is always @xmath45 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this work , we simply adopt @xmath175 for all the calculations .",
    "our results are basically the same as @xcite , i.e. , the advection timescale @xmath114 can be smaller than the diffusion timescale @xmath113 if there are strong enough winds driven by magnetic field ( fig .",
    "but in contrast to the results of @xcite , the main reason for @xmath176 is that the diffusion timescale increases a lot due to the decrease of viscosity @xmath67 ( @xmath177 ) , which is induced by the decrease of gas temperature resulting from the enormous energy taken away by the winds .",
    "the advection timescale @xmath114 does decrease in the middle and outer regions of a thin disk due to the increasing radial velocity .",
    "but in the inner disk region , the advection timescale of a disk with winds is found to be even larger than that of a standard disk when the radiation dominated inner disk disappears .",
    "the critical value of the magnetic field strength is @xmath178 in order to satisfy @xmath179 for @xmath180 and @xmath164 . and @xmath114 becomes smaller compared with @xmath113 for smaller @xmath81 . in figs .",

    "the mass loss rate @xmath32 is included when @xmath5 for all the figures .",
    "the largest total mass loss rate is about @xmath186 of the mass accretion rate at the outer boundary .",
    "in this work , we investigate the @xmath131 curves of a thin disk with magnetically driven winds .",
    "it is found that , because disk winds can greatly decrease the disk temperature , the critical accretion rate @xmath1 can be increased significantly and the disk becomes more stable ( figs .",
    "[ f2 ] , [ f3 ] ) .",
    "it seems that both the gas and radiation pressure dominated regions possess the same slopes in the @xmath131 curves ( @xmath159 ) when magnetic torques drive the inflow .",
    "but the real slope in the radiation pressure dominated region is between @xmath135 and @xmath132 in numerical calculations because both the viscous torque and magnetic torque are important when the mass accretion rate is close to the eddington accretion rate . the parameter @xmath57 , the strength and the morphology of the initial magnetic fields all strongly affect the critical accretion rate @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath161 and @xmath57 are smaller , the thin disk will be more stable . while the accretion disk with winds becomes stable for a high accretion rate , the luminosity threshold may not increase because of the much lower gas temperature .",
    "indeed , it is found that the disk luminosity corresponding to @xmath1 remains almost constant or even decreases slowly with the increase of @xmath1 ( fig .",
