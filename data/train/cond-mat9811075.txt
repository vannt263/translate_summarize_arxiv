    "the paradigm of correlated electron physics is based on the idea that for a certain category of systems one better starts out with the electronic structure of the atoms , treating the delocalization of the electrons in the solid as a perturbation .",
    "any student of physics has to struggle through the theory of atomic multiplets , which is rather complicated because of the intricacies associated with orbital angular momentum . at first sight",
    "it is therefore remarkable that these orbital degrees of freedom are completely neglected in the main stream of correlated electron physics .",
    "recently the interest in ` orbitals ' has been reviving , especially since they appear to be relevant in one way or another in the colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) manganites . in the wake of this development ,",
    "questions are asked on the relevancy of these orbitals in the context of seemingly settled problems like the metal - insulator transition in v@xmath2o@xmath1 @xcite . in this contribution",
    "we will review yet another recent development . even in the mott - insulating limit , where the physics simplifies considerably",
    ", the interplay of orbital and spin degrees of freedom poses a problem of principle .",
    "there are two limits where the role of orbital degeneracy is well understood : ( i ) the ` band structure limit ' , which is based on the assertion that electron correlations can be neglected . in any modern local density approximation ( lda ) band structure calculation , orbitals are fully taken into account on the one particle level , in so far as the atomic limit is of any relevance .",
    "these translate into various bands , giving rise to multi - sheeted fermi surfaces , etcetera .",
    "( ii ) the localized , orbital and spin ordered case which we will refer to as the ` classical limit ' . in mott - insulators , orbital degrees of freedom acquire a separate existence in much the same way as the spins of the electrons do",
    ". the orbitals can be parametrized by pseudospins and these form together with the physical spins a low energy sector which is described by generalizations of the heisenberg spin - hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "these are the spin - orbital models , like the kugel - khomskii ( kk ) model for @xmath0 degenerate cubic cuprates @xcite .",
    "the ` classically ' ordered states , becoming exact in the limit of infinite dimensions ( @xmath3 ) and/or large ( pseudo ) spin ( @xmath4 ) , define what is usually meant with orbital and spin order .",
    "the question arises if there are yet other possibilities .",
    "we started to study this problem quite some time ago @xcite , well before the subject revived due to the manganites .",
    "our motivation was actually related to a theoretical development flourishing in the 1980 s : large @xmath5 theories @xcite . by enlarging the symmetry ,",
    "say from @xmath6 to @xmath7 with @xmath5 large , new saddle points ( ordered states ) appear which correspond to the fluctuation dominated ( non - perturbative ) limit of the large @xmath8/large @xmath9 theories . for a single correlated impurity",
    ", orbital degeneracy leads in a natural way to these large @xmath5 notions .",
    "we asked the question if these large @xmath5 notions could become of relevance in lattice problems .",
    "we focussed on the simple problem of the @xmath0 jahn - teller degenerate mott - insulator , rediscovering the kk hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "we tried to tackle this problem using the techniques invented by arovas and auerbach for the @xmath7 symmetric heisenberg model @xcite .",
    "we found that the @xmath10 symmetry is so badly broken that the large @xmath5 techniques were of little help , which is another way of saying that the physics of the kk model is not controlled by large global symmetry .",
    "however , we did find a special approximate solution which revealed that the quantum fluctuations are actually enhanced , and this motivated us to study these fluctuations in more detail starting from the large @xmath8 limit . in this process we discovered that the enhancement of the fluctuations is due to the control exerted by a point in parameter space which can be either called an infinite order quantum - critical point , or a point of perfect _ dynamical frustration _ in the classical limit @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon will be discussed in the next section .",
    "it poses a rather interesting theoretical problem .",
    "so much is clear that the ground state degeneracy of the classical limit is lifted by quantum fluctuations and the question is on the character of the true ground state . as will be discussed , either the classical spin - orbital order might survive , stabilized by an order - out - of - disorder mechanism , or quantum - incompressible valence - bond like states might emerge . in section iii the role of electron - phonon coupling will be addressed , emphasizing the rather counter - intuitive result of lda+u electronic structure calculations that phonons play a rather secondary role despite the fact that the lattice deformations are large .",
    "finally , the situation in the manganites will be shortly discussed in section iv .",
    "consider a mott - insulator which is characterized by orbital degeneracy , besides the usual spin degeneracy .",
    "different from pure spin problems , these spin - orbital problems are rather ungeneric and depend on the precise system under consideration .",
    "a simple problem is a cubic lattice of @xmath11-ions in a @xmath12 configuration : the kugel - khomskii problem , which directly applies to cu perovskites like kcuf@xmath1 or k@xmath2cuf@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the large mott gap in the charge excitation spectrum simplifies matters considerably and one derives an effective hamiltonian by insisting on one hole per unit cell , deriving superexchange - like couplings between the spin and orbital degrees of freedom by integrating out virtual charge fluctuations .",
    "the spins are described as usually in terms of an @xmath14 algebra ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the orbital degrees of freedom are the @xmath0 cubic harmonics @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which can be parametrized in terms of pseudospins as @xmath18 .",
    "pauli matrices @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) are introduced acting on these states .",
    "different from the spins , the @xmath6 symmetry associated with the pseudospins is badly broken because the orbitals communicate with the underlying lattice .",
    "although the @xmath0 states are degenerate on a single site , this degeneracy is broken by the virtual charge fluctuations , which take place along the interatomic bonds , i.e. , in a definite direction with respect to the orientation of the orbitals .",
    "it is therefore convenient to introduce operators which correspond to orbitals directed either along or perpendicular to the three cubic axes @xmath21 , given by @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 in terms of these operators , the kugel - khomskii hamiltonian can be written as ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the hopping along the @xmath27-axis ) @xcite , @xmath28 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] neglecting the hund s rule splittings @xmath29 of the intermediate @xmath30 states",

    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] eq.s ( [ kk1],[kk2 ] ) are rather unfamiliar : they describe a regular heisenberg spin problem coupled into a pott s like orbital problem ( choose two out of three possibilities @xmath34 ) .",
    "the oddity of eq.s ( [ kk1],[kk2 ] ) becomes clear when one studies the classical limit .",
    "as usually , the @xmath35 s and the @xmath36 s are treated as classical vectors . in order to draw a phase diagram we introduced another control parameter ,",
    "@xmath37 a `` magnetic field '' for the orbital pseudo - spins , loosely associated with a uniaxial pressure along the @xmath27-axis .",
    "the classical limit phase diagram as function of @xmath38 and @xmath39 is shown in fig . 1 .    ( 8,8 ) ( 0.,0 . )    for a detailed discussion of the various phases we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite . to give some feeling , for large positive @xmath39",
    "the @xmath40 orbitals are occupied , forming @xmath41 planes of antiferromagnetically coupled spins ( afxx ) .",
    "this is nothing else than the situation realized in , e.g. la@xmath2cuo@xmath13 . for large negative @xmath39",
    "the @xmath42 orbitals condense , forming a 3d spatially anisotropic heisenberg antiferromagnet [ afzz with stronger exchange coupling along the @xmath27-axis than in the @xmath41 planes ] . finally , the moffa , moaff and moaaf phases are variations of the basic kugel - khomskii spin - orbital order @xcite obtained by rotating the magnetic and orbital structure by @xmath43 .",
    "for the moffa phase at @xmath44 , the orbitals have a two - sublattice structure in the @xmath41-planes ( @xmath45 and @xmath46 on the a- and b - sublattice , respectively ) . along the @xmath27-axis strong antiferromagnetic spin - spin couplings are found , while the spin couplings in the @xmath41 planes are ferromagnetic with a strength @xmath47 .",
    "the anomaly occurs at the origin @xmath48 of the phase diagram : a 3d antiferromagnet ( afzz ) , a 2d antiferromagnet ( afxx ) and a quasi-1d a - type antiferromagnet ( moffa / moaff / moaaf ) become degenerate ! the emphasis on the ` uniaxial pressure ' @xmath39 is misleading in the sense that the full scope of the problem is not visible directly from this phase diagram : at the origin of fig .",
    "1 an _ infinity _ of classical phases become degenerate .",
    "this is trivial to understand . in the absence of hund",
    "s rule exchange , the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ kk1 ] ) becomes the full story .",
    "assuming a 3d classical antiferromagnet , @xmath49 , and inserting this in eq .",
    "( [ kk1 ] ) yields , @xmath50 the orbital degrees of freedom are completely decoupled and all @xmath51 orbital configurations have the same energy ( @xmath52 ) ! in addition , this infinity of different 3d spin systems has the same energy as the moffa / moaff / moaaf phases .",
    "it is actually so that at any finite temperature the 3d antiferromagnet becomes stable because of the entropy associated with the decoupled orbital sector @xcite .",
    "this ` gauge ' degeneracy is clearly a pathology of the classical limit .",
    "we continued by studying the stability of the classical phase diagram with respect to gaussian quantum fluctuations .",
    "as discussed in more detail in ref .",
    "@xcite this is a somewhat subtle affair .",
    "intuitively , one could be tempted to think that the orbitals and spins can be excited independently .",
    "this is however not the case .",
    "the dynamical algebra of relevance to the problem is an @xmath53 algebra , and this implies that modes will occur which excite at the same time the spins and the orbitals : the spin - and - orbital waves ( sow ) s .",
    "next to a ( longitudinal ) sector of pure orbital excitations , a ` transversal ' sector is found corresponding with spin - excitations which are mixed with spin - and - orbital excitations , except for the acoustic modes at long wavelength which become pure spin - waves as imposed by the goldstone theorem .",
    "we found that upon approaching the infinite critical point , the mass gap associated with the discrete symmetry in the orbital sector collapses .",
    "the ( mixed ) transverse modes give the dominating contribution to the renormalization of energy and magnetic order parameter .",
    "in the afxx ( afzz ) phase the lowest transverse mode softens along @xmath54 [ @xmath55 , and equivalent lines in the brillouin zone ( bz ) , regardless how one approaches the critical lines .",
    "thus , these modes become dispersionless along particular ( soft - mode ) lines in the bz , where we find _ finite _ masses in the perpendicular directions , @xmath56 with @xmath57 and @xmath58 at the @xmath59 point , and the quantum fluctuations diverge logarithmically , @xmath60 , if @xmath61 at the transition .",
    "we found that the quantum correction to the order parameter @xmath62 becomes large , well before the critical point is reached . in fig .",
    "1 the lines are indicated where @xmath63 : in the area enclosed by the dashed and dotted lines classical order can not exist , at least not in gaussian order .",
    "if the classical limit is as sick as explained in the previous paragraphs , what is happening instead ? _ a priori _ it is not easy to give an answer to this question .",
    "there are no ` off the shelf ' methods to treat quantum spin problems characterized by classical frustration , and the situation is similar to what is found in , e.g. @xmath64 problems @xcite .",
    "a first possibility is quantum order - out - of - disorder @xcite : quantum fluctuations can stabilize a particular classical state over other classically degenerate states , if this particular state is characterized by softer excitations than any of the other candidates .",
    "khaliullin and oudovenko @xcite have suggested that this mechanism is operative in the present context , where the afzz 3d anisotropic antiferromagnet is the one becoming stable .",
    "their original argument was flawed because of the decoupling procedure they used , which violates the @xmath53 dynamical algebra constraints @xcite .",
    "however , khaliullin claims to have found an ` @xmath53 preserving ' self - consistent decoupling procedure which does yield order - out - of - disorder @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there is yet another possibility : valence - bond ( vb ) singlet ( or spin - peierls ) order , which at the least appears in a more natural way in the present context than is the case in higher dimensional spin - only problems , because it is favored by the directional nature of the orbitals .",
    "the essence of a ( resonating ) valence bond [ ( r)vb ] state is that one combines pairs of spins into singlets . in the short - range (",
    "r)vb states these singlets involve nearest - neighbor spin pairs .",
    "subsequently , one particular covering of the lattice with these ` spin - dimers ' might be favored ( vb or spin - peierls state ) , or the ground state might become a coherent superposition of many of these coverings ( rvb state ) . on a cubic lattice",
    "the difficulty is that although much energy is gained in the formation of the singlet pairs , the bonds between the singlets are treated poorly .",
    "nevertheless , both in 1d spin systems ( majumdar - ghosh @xcite , aklt - systems @xcite ) and in the large @xmath5 limit of @xmath7 magnets in 2d , ground states are found characterized by spin - peierls / vb order @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to understand that the interplay of orbital- and spin degrees of freedom tends to stabilize vb order .",
    "since the orbital sector is governed by a discrete symmetry , the orbitals tend to condense in some classical orbital order .",
    "different from the fully classical phases , one now looks for orbital configurations optimizing the energy of the spin vb configurations .",
    "the spin energy is optimized by having orbitals @xmath65 on the nearest - neighbor sites where the vb spin - pair lives , with @xmath66 directed along the bond .",
    "this choice maximizes the overlap between the wave functions , and thereby the binding energy of the singlet . at the same time",
    ", this choice of orbitals minimizes the unfavorable overlaps with spin pairs located in directions orthogonal to @xmath66 .",
    "the net result is that vb states are much better variational solutions for the kk model , as compared to the standard heisenberg spin systems .",
    "( 8,8 ) ( 0.,0 . )",
    "adressing this systematically , we found that two families of vb states are most stable : ( i ) the ` staggered ' vb states like the pvba and pvbic states of fig .",
    "these states have in common that the overlap between neighboring vb pairs is minimized : the large lobes of the @xmath65 wave functions of different pairs are never pointing to each other .",
    "( ii ) the ` columnar ' vb states like the vbc ( or vba ) state of fig .",
    "2 . in the orbital sector , this is nothing else than the afzz state of fig . 1 ( @xmath42 orbitals on every site ) . different from the afzz state ,",
    "the spin system living on this orbital backbone is condensed in a 1d spin - peierls state along the @xmath67-direction which is characterized by strong exchange couplings .",
    "the spins in the @xmath68-directions stay uncorrelated , due to the weakness of the respective exchange couplings as compared to the vb mass gap .",
    "the energies of these vb states and the classical states dressed up with quantum fluctuations are quite close together .",
    "a key issue is if the true ground state is compressible ( dressed classical state ) , or characterized by a dynamical mass - gap ( vb states ) .",
    "this will most likely depend on subtleties beyond the reach of the relatively crude variational anstze presented here @xcite .",
    "so the nature of the ground state of the kugel - khomskii problem for small hunds - rule coupling is still an open problem .",
    "in the previous section we discussed the orbital order as driven by the electron - electron interactions . however , one can think quite differently about the real systems : the deformations found in kcuf@xmath1 ( or lamno@xmath1 ) could in principle be entirely caused by phonon - driven collective jahn - teller effects .",
    "this subject has been intensely studied in the past and is well understood .",
    "it starts out neglecting electron - electron interactions , and the focus is instead on the electron - phonon coupling . in case that the ions are characterized by a jahn - teller ( orbital ) degeneracy , one can integrate out the ( optical ) phonons , and one finds effective hamiltonians with phonon mediated interactions between the orbitals . in the specific case of @xmath0 degenerate ions in a cubic crystal ,",
    "these look quite similar to the kk hamiltonian , except that the spin dependent term is absent@xcite .",
    "any orbital order resulting from this hamiltonian is now accompanied by a lattice distortion of the same symmetry .",
    "the size of the quadrupolar deformation in the @xmath41 plane of kcuf@xmath1 is actually as large as 4 % of the lattice constant ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "it is therefore often argued that the orbital order is clearly phonon - driven , and that the physics of the previous section is an irrelevancy .",
    "although appealing at first sight , this argument is flawed : large displacements do not necessarily imply that phonons do all the work .",
    "the deformations of the lattice and the orbital degrees of freedom can not be disentangled using general principles : they constitute an irreducible subsector of the problem .",
    "the issue is therefore a quantitative one , and in the absence of experimental guidance one would therefore like to address the issue with a quantitative electronic structure method .",
    "the lda+u method is the method of choice .",
    "it is constructed to handle the physics of electronic orbital ordering , keeping the accurate treatment of the electron - lattice interaction of lda intact . according to lda+u calculations",
    "the total energy gained by the deformation of the lattice is minute as compared to the energies involved in the electronic orbital ordering @xcite . at the same time , the phonons are important on the macroscopic scale and they contribute to driving kcuf@xmath1 away from the infinite - critical point of the phase diagram fig . 1 .",
    "we start out with the observation that according to lda kcuf@xmath1 would be an undistorted , cubic system : the energy increases if the distortion is switched on ( see fig .",
    "the reason is that kcuf@xmath1 would be a band metal according to lda ( the usual mott - gap problem ) with a fermi - surface which is not susceptible to a band jahn - teller instability .",
    "lda+u yields a drastically different picture @xcite .",
    "lda can be looked at as unpolarized lda+u , and by letting both the orbitals and the spins polarize an energy is gained of order of the band gap , i.e. , of the order of 1 ev . the orbital- and spin polarization is nearly complete and the situation is close to the strong coupling limit underlying the spin - orbital models of section ii .",
    "also when the cubic lattice is kept fixed , the correct orbital and spin ordering ( moffa of fig .",
    "1 ) is found , with spin - exchange constants which compare favorably with experiment @xcite . because the orbital order has caused the electron density to become highly unsymmetric",
    ", the cubic lattice is unstable .",
    "further energy can be gained by letting the lattice relax . the lattice distortion calculated in lda+u",
    "( @xmath70 3% of @xmath69 ) comes close to the actual distortion of kcuf@xmath1 ( @xmath70 4 % ) .",
    "however , despite the fact that the distortion is large , the energy gained by the lattice relaxation is rather minute : @xmath71 mev ( see fig .",
    "3 ) ! obviously , in the presence of the electronic orbital order the cubic lattice becomes very soft with regard to the quadrupolar distortions and even a small electron - phonon coupling can cause large distortions .",
    "( 8,8 ) ( 0.,0 . )",
    "although the energy gained in the deformation of the lattice is rather small , the electron - phonon coupling is quite effective in keeping kcuf@xmath1 away from the physics associated with the origin of the phase diagram ( fig .",
    "1 ) . since",
    "the ferromagnetic interactions in the @xmath41 plane of kcuf@xmath1 are quite small ( @xmath72 mev , as compared to the ` 1d ' exchange @xmath73 mev @xcite ) , one might argue that the effective hund s rule coupling @xmath74 as of relevance to the low energy theory is quite small .",
    "although this still needs further study , it might well be that in the absence of the electron - phonon coupling kcuf@xmath1 would be close to the origin of fig .",
    "however , the electron - phonon coupling can be looked at as yet another axis emerging from the origin . in principle , the electron - phonon coupling introduces two scales : ( i ) a retardation scale , which is governed by the ratio of the phonon frequency and the electronic scale set by @xmath75 mev . since @xmath76 is relatively small , kcuf@xmath1 is close to the anti - adiabatic limit where the lattice follows the electronic fluctuations , ( ii ) in the anti - adiabatic limit the phonons are high energy modes which can be integrated out , causing the effective orbital - orbital couplings we earlier referred to .",
    "these couplings destroy the cancellations leading to eq .",
    "( [ 3ddeg ] ) , thereby driving the system away from the point of classical degeneracy .",
    "the typical scale for the phonon induced effective orbital interactions is at most of the order of the lda+u lattice relaxation energy . however , as the latter ( @xmath71 mev ) is quite a bit larger than @xmath76 , the effective interaction will likely be able to put kcuf@xmath1 well outside the ` dangerous ' region near the origin of the phase diagram .",
    "in summary , although further work is needed it might be that phonons are to a large extent responsible for the stability of kcuf@xmath1 s classical ground state . in any case",
    ", one can not rely on the sheer size of the lattice deformations to resolve this issue !",
    "given the discussion so far , the search for interesting quantum effects in orbital degenerate mott - insulators should not be regarded as hopeless .",
    "unfortunately , the insulating parent compounds of the cmr manganites , such as lamno@xmath1 , are _ not _ candidates for this kind of physics .",
    "the reason is not necessarily phonons : also in the manganites the ` jahn - teller ' lattice distortions are sizable , but this does not necessarily imply that the phonons are dominating .",
    "two of us derived a kugel - khomskii - type model of relevance to this regime , and we did find a dynamical frustration of @xmath0-superexchange at @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "however , the system is driven away from this point by two effects : ( i ) the manganites are in the hund s rule dominated regime , with a large splitting between the lowest energy high - spin state at @xmath78 ( with @xmath79 ev @xcite ) , and the low - spin states at energies @xmath80 ; ( ii ) the additional @xmath81-superexchange between the @xmath82 cores favours an antiferromagnetic order in all three spatial directions .",
    "the net outcome is that the ferromagnetic interaction between the _ total @xmath83 spins _ in the @xmath41 planes is of order of the @xmath27-axis exchange , signalling that the manganites are in the hund s rule stabilized regime of the phase diagram .",
    "the mysteries of the manganites relate to what happens when quantum - mechanical holes are added to the orbital / spin ordered insulator .",
    "this is undoubtedly a problem with its own characteristics , which can not be reduced to a variation on the far simpler problems encountered in the insulators .",
    "nevertheless , we do believe that the study of the insulating limit might be of some help in better appreciating what is going on in the doped systems .",
    "it is tempting to think about orbital degrees of freedom as being spins in disguise .",
    "this is not quite the case .",
    "orbitals are far less quantum - mechanical  they are more like ising spins than heisenberg spins .",
    "secondly , orbitals carry this unfamiliar property that depending on their specific orientation in internal space , overlaps increase in particular real space directions , while they diminish in orthogonal directions .",
    "our valence - bond constructions illustrate this peculiar phenomenon in the case of spins , but the same logic is at work when the hole is delocalizing .",
    "this intimate connection between internal symmetry and the directionality of delocalization causes the dynamical frustration which has been highlighted in this communication .",
    "this motive seems also at work in the doped system , witness the many near degenerate states found both in mean - field calculations @xcite and in experiment @xcite .",
