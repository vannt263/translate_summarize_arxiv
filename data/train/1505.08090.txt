    "the multifunctional properties of heusler - type ni - mn based magnetic alloys that undergo a martensitic transformation originate from the interaction between structural and magnetic degrees of freedom .",
    "properties as shape memory @xcite , magnetic superelasticity @xcite , magnetocaloric @xcite and barocaloric effect @xcite have attracted considerable attention due to their potential use in applications .",
    "however , the lattice dynamics and its coupling to magnetic properties has been studied only little in these alloys .",
    "it has been experimentally shown that in ni - mn-_x _ alloys with @xmath4 , al and in the transverse ta@xmath5 phonon branch shows a dip at a particular wave number which softens upon decreasing the temperature toward the martensitic transformation from the high temperature cubic phase toward a lower - symmetry martensitic phase @xcite .",
    "a softening has been further observed in the elastic constants @xcite and is typically found in bcc - based materials which undergo a martensitic transformation .",
    "this softening reflects the dynamical instability of the cubic lattice against the shearing of the \\{110 } planes along the @xmath6 directions .",
    "together , with the premartensitic transition found in some of the ni - mn - ga alloys , the softening is a pretransitional effect of the martensitic transition @xcite .",
    "additional evidence of magnetoelastic coupling has been provided by an enhancement of the anomalous phonon softening accompanying the ferromagnetic ( fm ) ordering @xcite and by the change in the elastic constants upon application of a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "more generally , softening ( or stiffening ) is a consequence of coupling between the driving order parameter(s ) for a phase transition and strain , which means that observed variations of elastic constants should provide insights into both strain relaxational behavior and the underlying lattice dynamics of ni - mn - based heusler compounds that undergo a martensitic transformation .",
    "recently , we showed that ni@xmath0mn@xmath1in@xmath2 exhibits an inverse magnetocaloric effect of @xmath7  k , in a field change of 6  t , that arises mainly from a change in the entropy due to the structural transition @xcite . at 4",
    "k the application of a 20  t field , still induces the martensitic transition and , besides the change in magnetic moment , leads to a relative change in length of 0.8  % @xcite .",
    "this indicates a strong magnetostructural coupling , that might be exploited in applications as actuators or sensors .",
    "the objective of the work presented here was to characterize both static and dynamic strain coupling in this material by following the temperature dependence of elastic and anelastic anomalies which accompany the magnetic and structural transitions .",
    "we present data for a polycrystalline sample of ni@xmath0mn@xmath1in@xmath2 obtained by resonant ultrasound spectroscopy ( rus ) , which is a convenient method for measuring changes in elastic constants and acoustic attenuation of small samples , with dimensions of between 1 and 5  mm , in a frequency range @xmath8  mhz @xcite .",

    "polycrystalline samples of ni@xmath0mn@xmath1in@xmath2 were obtained by arc - melting stoichiometric amounts of the constituent elements under argon atmosphere .",
    "the ingots were remelted several times to assure a high homogeneity .",

    "the high quality of the samples was confirmed by powder x - ray diffraction .",
    "magnetization measurements were carried out in a physical property measurement system ( quantum design ) . for rus",
    "a sample was cut in the form of an approximately rectangular parallelepiped with dimensions @xmath10 and mass 43.2  mg .",

    "the sample sits directly between the transducers and is suspended in an atmosphere of a few mbars of helium gas , within a helium flow cryostat @xcite .",
    "spectra containing 50.000 , 65.000 or 130.000 data points were collected in the frequency range @xmath12  khz during cycles of cooling and heating in the low temperature instrument and heating followed by cooling in the high temperature instrument .",
    "a period of 20 minutes was allowed for thermal equilibration before data collection at each set point .",
    "the frequency , @xmath13 , and width at half height , @xmath14 , of selected resonance peaks in the primary spectra were fit with an asymmetric lorentzian function . for a polycrystalline sample ,",
    "the square of the resonance frequency of each peak scales with some combination of the shear and bulk moduli but , since the resonance modes involve predominantly shearing motions , the variation of @xmath15 effectively reflects that of the shear modulus .",
    "the inverse mechanical quality factor is taken to be @xmath16 , and is a measure of acoustic attenuation .",
    "figure  [ mag ] shows the magnetization curves for ni@xmath0mn@xmath1in@xmath2 measured under an applied magnetic field of 500  oe following zero - field - cooled ( zfc ) , field - cooled ( fc ) , and field - heated ( fh ) protocols .",
    "first the sample was cooled down in the absence of field from 350  k down to 2  k. at 2  k the magnetic field was applied and the zfc curve was measured on heating up to 350  k. then the fc curve was measured upon cooling and , subsequently , the fh curve was measure on heating .",
    "ni@xmath0mn@xmath1in@xmath2 exhibits upon cooling a paramagnetic to fm transition in the austenite phase at @xmath17  k , followed by a first - order martensitic magnetostructural transition from a cubic high - temperature phase to a low - temperature monoclinic phase at @xmath18  k. upon heating this transition takes place at @xmath19  k. the martensitic transition is accompanied by a change from the ferromagnetic ( fm ) state to an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) state that then orders ferromagnetically at @xmath20  k. the difference in magnetization between the austenite and martensitic phases arises from the changes in the spacing between mn atoms since the magnetic moments are localized mainly on these and the exchange interaction strongly depends on the mn - mn distance .",

    "a further explanation is based on the presence of afm components that pin the fm matrix in different spin configurations depending on whether a cooling - field is present or absent , leading to a magnetically inhomogeneous state @xcite .",

    "in combination , the magnetization and rus data allow a straightforward comparison of the strength of strain coupling associated with each transition .",
    "clearly , the dominant changes in the shear modulus are associated with the large shear strains associated with the martensitic transition .",
    "the very small anomaly in @xmath15 at @xmath25 implies only weak coupling of the ferromagnetic order parameter with shear strain , and , similarly , for the magnetic ordering at @xmath21 there is little or no deflection in the trend of @xmath15 which might indicate any significant magnetoelastic coupling below the second magnetic ordering transition .",
    "the martensitic phase below @xmath39 in a sample with a close composition ( ni@xmath0mn@xmath40in@xmath41 at @xmath42 ) is known to consist of a mixture of 10 m and 14 m structures @xcite , each of which has substantial shear strains with respect to the parent cubic structure .",

    "there are three order parameters to consider but , as already noted , coupling between the magnetic order parameter(s ) and shear strain is evidently weak .",
    "this leaves two order parameters driven by changes in electronic structure , the first of which , @xmath61 , would give rise to the symmetry change fm@xmath62 m - i4/mmm and the second , @xmath63 , is responsible for the multiple repeat of the 10 m structure .",
    "@xmath61 has the symmetry properties of the irreducible representation @xmath64 and if the complication of incommensurate ordering is ignored @xmath63 would have symmetry properties corresponding to a point away from the brillouin zone center along the @xmath65 $ ] line .",
    "the essential point is that @xmath61 would couple bilinearly with a tetragonal strain ( @xmath66 ) to give pseudoproper ferroelastic behavior and @xmath63 would have linear - quadratic coupling ( @xmath67 ) to give an improper ferroelastic transition . with regard to the elastic constants ,",
    "the former would give characteristic softening of ( @xmath68 ) as @xmath69 approaches the martensitic transition point from above and below while the latter would give a step - like softening below the transition temperature @xcite .",
    "the shear modulus of a cubic crystal comprises of both ( @xmath68 ) and @xmath70 but there is no real indication in the data for @xmath15 in fig .",
    "[ rus1 ] of significant pseudoproper ferroelastic softening cooling towards the martensitic transition point from the stability field of the cubic phase .",
    "it is therefore concluded that the martensitic transition is driven primarily by @xmath63 and is essentially improper ferroelastic . rather than there being an abrupt softening below the transition point",
    ", however , there is an apparently continuous and large stiffening . from this",
    "it is clear that any contributions from relaxations due to @xmath67 coupling must be small , where @xmath71 could be any of the three shear strains , and the overall elastic properties are determined by the next higher order ( biquadratic ) terms , @xmath72 . in this case",
    "the amount of elastic stiffening with respect to the cubic parent structure scales with @xmath73 .",
    "the transition is first order in character , so the apparently continuous variation of the effective shear modulus is most likely to be a consequence of averaging the elastic constants of the two ( or more ) coexisting structures in the close vicinity of the transition point .",
    "elastic softening due to coupling of the form ( @xmath67 ) requires that on the time scale of some applied stress there is a relaxation of the strain and , consequently , of the order parameter .",
    "it is inevitable that there must be some frequency above which an approach to equilibrium elastic properties is not observed because there is insufficient time for these relaxations to occur . in this case",
    "the contributions of higher order coupling of the form @xmath72 might still be detected .",
    "such an effect might normally be expected to be small whereas the data in fig .",
    "[ rus1 ] show stiffening of the shear modulus by over 100% .",
    "similar stiffening has been observed in association with the martensitic transition in single crystal cu@xmath74al@xmath75be@xmath76 both at @xmath77  mhz and @xmath78  hz @xcite , implying that the issue may not be simply a matter of dispersion with respect to frequency , though this is not a group / subgroup transition and the elastic stiffening was attributed to pinning of twin walls by dislocations .",
    "substantial stiffening in an entirely unrelated material , sral@xmath5o@xmath79 , also has a pattern that appears to be due to @xmath72 coupling @xcite , and is most unlikely to have been affected by dislocations .",
    "the hexagonal - monoclinic transition in sral@xmath5o@xmath79 also involves a combination of two order parameters , one of which belongs to a zone center irreducible representation ( also pseudoproper ferroelastic ) , while the other belongs to a zone boundary irreducible representation @xcite .",
    "the two non - zero shear strains have values up to about @xmath80  % and @xmath81  % . the common feature between ni@xmath0mn@xmath1in@xmath2 and sral@xmath5o@xmath79",
    "is the presence of two order parameters with different symmetry properties , and we therefore speculate that the strains from these lock together in such a way that strain / order parameter relaxation is suppressed",
    ". the outcome could then be a substantial increase in rigidity , i.e. the structures become elastically stiffer rather than softer .    as seen in fig .",
    "[ tca ] , the onset of elastic softening ahead of the martensitic transition is at the ferromagnetic transition temperature , @xmath17  k. the effect is too subtle to be seen in the relatively noisy ultrasonic data of moya _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , but a similar pattern of softening occurs in ( @xmath82 ) below the equivalent ferromagnetic transition and ahead of the premartensite transition in a single crystal with composition close to stoichiometric ni@xmath5mnga @xcite .",
    "_ reported that the lattice geometry remains cubic in this temperature interval , again signifying that direct magnetoelastic coupling is weak .",
    "the form of the elastic anomaly expected from coupling of the form @xmath83 would be a stepwise softening at @xmath84 , but instead there is continuously increasing softening with respect the trend extrapolated from above @xmath85 , consistent with the coupling coefficient , @xmath86 , being negligibly small . in this case",
    "the softening would scale with @xmath87 , due to coupling of the form @xmath88 , as appears to be the case .",
    "softening rather than stiffening implies that the coupling coefficient has opposite sign ( and is much smaller ) in comparison with stiffening below the martensitic transition temperature .",
    "the variation of @xmath27 in fig .",
    "[ invq ] has a pattern which is typical of acoustic loss accompanying a ferroelastic phase transition @xcite .",
    "the conventional explanation would be of a steep increase at the transition point associated with the appearance of twin walls which are mobile under application of an internal stress . in the austenite phase there is no twinning or any other significant damping mechanism present in there in contrast to the martensite phase @xcite .",
    "the plateau of @xmath27 below this is due to thermally activated mobility of the twin walls in an effectively viscous medium . at some lower temperature",
    "the twin walls become pinned by defects in a freezing interval which is readily identifiable by the development of a debye peak in the loss and an increase in stiffness with respect to shear , as appears to be occur at @xmath26 .",
    "the loss peak can be fit according to @xcite @xmath89^{-1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath90 is the maximum of the peak at @xmath26 , @xmath91 is the activation energy and @xmath92 is a width parameter , which arises from any spread in relaxation times for the dissipation processes .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ invq ] shows the results of a fit to @xmath93 from the peak in the rus spectra near 0.43  mhz . after subtracting a base line ,",
    "the fitting gives @xmath94 , @xmath95  kj / mol , and @xmath96  k. if the loss mechanism is assumed to be due to a single relaxation process ( @xmath97 ) related to displacements of domain walls , the debye peak in @xmath27 signifies the freezing of the domain - wall movement with a thermal activation energy of about 31  kj / mol ( @xmath98  ev ) .",
    "the peak in @xmath27 occurs at @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the angular frequency ( @xmath101 ) and @xmath102 using the fit values of @xmath26 and @xmath91 , at @xmath103  hz then gives an estimate for the inverse attempt frequency as @xmath104  s. variations of @xmath27 below the debye loss peak are noisy but decrease steeply with falling temperature .",
    "the rus data are consistent with a previous report of pinning of twin walls below @xmath105  k in ni - mn - ga martensite @xcite , which is comparable with the freezing behavior found here at @xmath106  k. discussions of twin wall mobility in the 10 m phase of ni - mn - ga alloys have focused on the stress felt by two different types of twin walls under the influence of an externally applied magnetic field @xcite . of these",
    ", one has a thermally activated mechanism for sideways displacements in response to the field , and the mechanism is understood to involve nucleation and subsequent migration of ledges along the walls .",
    "an activation energy barrier of 0.15 - 0.30  ev has been reported to give good agreement with observations @xcite , and the present result is consistent with this . internal friction measurements at @xmath107  hz of a ni - mn - ga alloys with unspecified superstructure types gave activation energy values in the range @xmath108  ev , however @xcite .",
    "the pinning mechanisms are not understood but the higher value could imply a mechanism involving interaction with impurity atoms @xcite .    a freezing process described by equation ( [ debye ] ) must be accompanied by elastic stiffening according to the debye equations in the usual way .",
    "the relationships required in this context are @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the phase angle , and , in the case of a standard linear solid @xmath111 @xmath112 is the relevant elastic modulus for the unrelaxed state , excluding strain due to movement of the wall , and @xmath113 the modulus of the relaxed state , including the strain due to movement of the wall to its new equilibrium position @xcite .",
    "the relationship between @xmath114 and @xmath27 is @xcite @xmath115    on this basis , and using @xmath94 at @xmath116 ( @xmath99 ) , the expected change in @xmath15 in fig .",
    "[ rus1 ] is @xmath117  hz@xmath118 which is sufficiently close to the observed change , @xmath119  hz@xmath118 , to confirm that both anomalies could be due simply to freezing of the twin wall motion .",
    "the nature of the pinning mechanism is not known , but it may only be coincidence that it occurs just below the transition from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic transition at @xmath20  k. by comparing the @xmath93 with the zfc magnetization curve we see that the decrease in the acoustic loss goes along with a decrease in the zfc magnetization .",
    "this behavior might be related with competing afm and fm interactions which are blocked in a glassy magnetic state @xcite .",
    "the strong frequency dependence of the peak below @xmath26 can be taken as a further hint for the glassy character of the strain distribution in the sample .",
    "the existence of a strain - glass phase has been proposed in the shape - memory alloys ti@xmath0ni@xmath40fe@xmath41 @xcite or , recently , in the heusler material ni - co - mn - ga @xcite .",
    "it has been further predicted for ni - co - mn-_z _ compounds with @xmath120 , sn , and sb @xcite . because of the magnetoelastic coupling , supermagnetoelastic behavior ( existence of strong fm and afm interactions in mn - rich heusler alloys , which allows elastic softening of the magnetic sublattices , in particular , near the magnetostructural transition ) , magnetic - cluster - spin glass and strain glass should mutually interact in fm shape memory heusler alloys .",
    "the kinetic arrest phenomenon as a relict of the magnetostructural transformation also supports the glassy behavior and may even lead to strain - glass formation interacting with the magnetic glasses @xcite .",
    "the kinetic arrest phenomena has been also observed in ni@xmath0mn@xmath1in@xmath2 @xcite .",
