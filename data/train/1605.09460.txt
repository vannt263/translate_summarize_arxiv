    "my research career got off to an early start in ann arbor .",
    "my earliest memories go back there to the late 1930s . my father taught econometrics and location theory at the university .",
    "the building always smelled of cigars . in his lecture room",
    "he had a giant wall - mounted sliderule and a desktop framework he had constructed with a few hundred vertical wires holding just as many gold - colored cubes .",
    "each cube could slide up or down its @xmath0 support wire to represent an @xmath1 point on a surface in three - dimensional space .",
    "our family moved to washington d c during the war years for government work on rationing and price controls .",
    "my father , though assigned to the navy , spent the last year of the war in germany in a jeep , estimating the cost of rebuilding .    back at home",
    "i was fascinated by mathematics , particularly the identity : @xmath2 at woodrow wilson high school louise `` quiz '' stull taught a rigorous and stimulating chemistry class .",
    "i was inspired by her example and that of my chemist uncle john redfield hoover , a plastics enthusiast and fan of dixieland jazz .",
    "after graduation i set off to oberlin ohio with a procter and gamble scholarship , planning to learn more chemistry .",
    "i particularly enjoyed luke steiner s chemistry and thermodynamics courses there .",
    "stull professor steiner used surprise quizzes to keep his class alert .",
    "in his thermodynamics course we integrated heat capacity data by counting squares on large - size graph paper .    in my third year at oberlin",
    "i had an automobile accident and missed a semester of school .",
    "as a fringe benefit i chose to take stuart rice s course in statistical mechanics at harvard that summer , while earning a little money in my spare time helping measure cats brain waves at m i t. after graduating from oberlin i returned to michigan in 1958 for a phd in chemical physics with andy de rocco , a gifted and fun - loving teacher of statistical mechanics , with his course based on joaquin luttinger s lecture notes .",
    "i also took frank harary s graph - theory course in the mathematics department .",
    "graph theory came in handy years later in livermore in working with francis ree on the mayers virial series .",
    "we related the graphs for pressure with those for the pair distribution function , and to the many - fewer but more - sophisticated graphs that have by now been successfully pursued through the tenth virial coefficient for hard disks and hard spheres@xcite .",
    "there was a fortran course about three hours long , given all in one evening , enabling me to transition to an ibm 704 from andy s olivetti calculator with its paper tape and the chemistry department s hand - cranked marchant calculators .",
    "programming was in the `` mad '' language .",
    "michigan s algorithmic decoder language honored the magazine fixture alfred e. neuman .",
    "i also had the good luck to hear george uhlenbeck s physics lectures on kinetic theory , transcribed to the board from a musty notebook he held at arm s length .",
    "chemistry students at michigan typically prepared seminars based on recent scientific american articles .",
    "i was fortunate to read berni alder and tom wainwright s `` molecular motions '' article ( see * figure 1 * ) in the october 1959 scientific american@xcite .",
    "that article piqued my interest in livermore with the goal of doing molecular dynamics . but first came some useful additional study , a post - doctoral year with jacques poirier in durham north carolina where i learned to evaluate cluster integrals by monte carlo integration .      by the time i left michigan for a postdoc at duke",
    "i was hooked on computer simulation . during the spring of 1962",
    "i interviewed at livermore , with berni and tom , and at los alamos , with bill wood .",
    "livermore won out .",
    "besides the better money for me it was much more interesting to see _ motion _ governed by differential equations rather than watching uncorrelated monte carlo _ moves _ , no matter how clever the underlying algorithm .",
    "berni made it easy for me to learn and to work with him and some of his many colleagues , brad holian , francis ree , tom wainwright , and david young .",
    "we worked on a variety of projects in kinetic theory and statistical mechanics , mostly directed toward equation of state properties for hard particles .",
    "our first project@xcite ( see * figures 2 and 3 * ) provided a great example of advancing theory by the observation and description of computer experiments .",
    "movies of hard - disk dynamics as well as bill wood s reports of his monte carlo studies at los alamos , revealed extensive cooperative motions of disks , both linear and circular in nature .",
    "these correlated motions suggested modifying the cell model for dense fluids .",
    "that model approximates the @xmath3th root of the partition function by a single - particle free - volume integral .",
    "this good idea is exact for a very light particle which moves so rapidly that its neighbors appear to be stationary .",
    "a `` correlated '' cell model based on the idea of correlated motion was my first livermore publication .",
    "the resulting van der waals-like loop closely matched the large - system transition from fluid to solid as it was estimated in the 1960s .",
    "a more precise idea of what happens at the melting and freezing densities was intensively investigated 50 years later@xcite .",
    "although the details involve a `` hexatic '' phase@xcite ( see * figure 5 * ) on the solid side of the transition , from the visual standpoint the transition appears to be first - order .",
    "the current estimate for the transition pressure is just 3 percent higher than berni and tom s 1962 estimate@xcite and 1.6 percent lower than our best guesses with francis ree and dave young in 1968@xcite as shown in * figure 3*.    [ [ gordon - conferences - in - new - hampshire - and - cecam - workshops - in - france ] ] gordon conferences in new hampshire and cecam workshops in france ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    with the equilibrium equation - of - state problem solved by a van - der - waals-like perturbation theory@xcite it was time to move on . by 1971",
    "berni had helped me into a teaching position at teller tech , where my first phd student , bill ashurst , from just across the street at the sandia laboratory , shared my interest in _ nonequilibrium _ molecular dynamics .",
    "we developed numerical methods for measuring transport coefficients by modifying hamiltonian mechanics to include velocity and temperature gradients . that work led to participating in gordon conferences in new hampshire , meeting scientists from all over the world , and to travel abroad .",
    "i participated in carl moser s cecam workshops , originally in orsay and later at lyon , getting acquainted with many of the men interested in molecular dynamics and visiting their laboratories : giovanni ciccotti , gianni iacucci , dimitri kusnezov , michel mareschal , shuichi nos , loup verlet , bob watts , kris wojciechowski , and les woodcock . in those days it was exciting and interesting to establish the agreement between the monte carlo and molecular dynamics methods for systems as small as four particles@xcite .",
    "molecular dynamics had the advantages of simulating actual motions while solving nonequilibrium problems and generating nonequilibrium distribution functions@xcite .",
    "see ashurst s * figure 5*.      bill ashurst had finished his thesis work , simulating nonequilibrium shear and heat flows with pair potentials , in 1974 .",
    "i arranged a fulbright leave to extend the pair - potential calculations to water with bob watts at canberra .",
    "once i had arrived two setbacks disabled the plan : [ 1 ] bob was appointed head of the computer centre within a week of my arrival and [ 2 ] his potential for water turned out to be unstable . as a result i mainly worked with my son nathan , evaluating hard - disk free volumes in the solid and fluid phases and locating the percolation transition where the free volume changes from intensive to extensive@xcite .",
    "two ways of illustrating the free volumes ( disks of radius @xmath4 above and diameter @xmath4 below ) appear in * figure 6*.    our office was just across the hall from a door with a hand - lettered sign identifying the occupant , a recent phd and enthusiastic bush - walker , `` bigfoot evans '' .",
    "along with the watts , we spent a lot of time together socially and in the mountains , despite bob s immersion , if not quite drowning , in administrative work .",
    "almost every weekend found us exploring the australian bush or rock climbing at booroomba rocks , just half an hour outside canberra .    in 1967",
    "i set out to model the propagation of strong shockwaves in solids , strong enough to cause melting .",
    "although a preliminary account was published@xcite the project was never completed due to the unreliability of the magnetic tapes on which the particle coordinates and velocities were stored .",
    "large - scale shockwave simulations were put on hold until around 1980 . by",
    "that time klimenko and dremin had published shockwave profiles@xcite for two different shock strengths .",
    "their results are the solid lines in * figure 7*. in 1979 i compared their molecular dynamics simulations of shockwaves to the predictions of navier - stokes continuum mechanics@xcite . the good agreement at 12 and 27 kilobars set the stage for a large - scale higher - pressure effort at nearly 400 kilobars .",
    "the work involved seven of us confronting computer simulations of transport coefficients with the high - pressure shockwave data@xcite .",
    "the agreement was semiquantitative .",
    "the observed viscosity at 400 kilobars was about thirty percent higher than the low - strainrate newtonian viscosity .",
    "steady shear experiments predict a decrease rather than an increase . thus there is still some interesting work to be done in order to understand this difference in the rate dependence .      after his thesis work in kyoto shuichi nos moved to faroff northern canada to a postdoctoral position with mike klein .",
    "nos published two amazing papers in 1984 showing how to do constant _ temperature _ molecular dynamics in the canonical ensemble@xcite .",
    "he used a logarithmic potential to store the excess energy from fluctuations around the mean .",
    "their importance was clear .",
    "he was invited to a cecam workshop at orsay , just outside paris , to discuss his work . after reading his papers",
    "i arranged to attend that cecam workshop .",
    "on the way there i came across nos on an orly - to - paris train platform , a few days before the workshop was to begin .",
    "this was very good luck ! back in livermore",
    "i had prepared a list of a dozen discussion questions for him concerning his papers .",
    "most of them had to do with `` time - scaling '' , an important step in his work and one that was entirely foreign to me .",
    "the timescaling variable @xmath5 varies with time between zero and unity .",
    "@xmath5 appears in the denominator of the kinetic energy in nos s hamiltonian so that the equation of motion for the friction coefficient @xmath6 , for the motion of the momentum conjugate to @xmath5 , with @xmath7 in the denominator , is quite stiff : @xmath8    nos and i went over the new concepts carefully on a bench in front of the notre dame cathedral .",
    "that informative meeting , together with the stimulation from the workshop that followed led me to spend the next two weeks after the workshop at philippe choquard s laboratory in lausanne .",
    "one of his students helped me to make tektronix plots of harmonic oscillator canonical trajectories , shown in * figure 8*. in the student s words `` we make a graphique '' !",
    "it was amazing to me that the @xmath9 trajectories generated by two entirely different sets of differential equations , one stiff and the other not , were identical .",
    "the original stiff equations were relatively useless .",
    "the `` scaled '' equations with all of the rates multiplied by @xmath5 , were well - behaved and quite useful in equilibrium canonical - ensemble simulations .    to illustrate , nos s original and `` scaled '' equations of motion for a harmonic oscillator are as follows : @xmath10 \\ ; \\ ] ] @xmath11 \\ .\\ ] ]",
    "nos s four scaled first - order equations can then be simplified , eliminating both @xmath12 and @xmath5 to give a second - order coordinate - space `` thermostated '' equation of motion along with a first - order `` feedback '' equation for the friction coefficient @xmath13 : @xmath14 \\ .\\ ] ] @xmath15 , originally the momentum associated with @xmath5 , now plays the role of a `` friction coefficient '' , or `` thermostat variable '' . the missing equation , @xmath16 , is best ignored , as @xmath5 plays no role in the time - development of the oscillator trajectory . in the simpler `` nos - hoover '' approach the time derivative of @xmath13",
    "is derived directly from liouville s flow equation rather than from nos s `` _ ad hoc _ '' hamiltonian .",
    "it was nt until twelve years later , 1996 , that dettmann and morriss published a method@xcite that avoids the explicit time - scaling step by the equivalent two - part process of [ 1 ] multiplying the hamiltonian by @xmath5 and [ 2 ] setting the value of the hamiltonian equal to zero .",
    "though unconventional it turns out that this same idea actually works in general if one wishes to multiply the rates by an _",
    "arbitrary _ function provided that the hamiltonians are also set equal to zero : @xmath17    in lausanne after the orsay meeting , and with a good understanding of nos s work , i wrote a short paper describing my own interpretation of his work along with a simpler derivation of his results .",
    "my liouville equation approach avoided nos s time - scaling .",
    "i included applications to the harmonic oscillator and the isobaric ensemble .",
    "those three pages@xcite , with the lausanne tektronix plots , describing what is now called `` nos - hoover '' mechanics have generated many extensions in directions well beyond my understanding .",
    "oddly enough i havent since used this scaling trick with any other problem , but it looks like a good one to remember nonetheless .    the microcanonical oscillator is the simplest of problems .",
    "it gives a circular phase - plane orbit .",
    "* figure 9 * illustrates examples of the complexity of the nos - hoover oscillator dynamics in the canonical ensemble .",
    "six percent of the stationary distribution function for the oscillator s phase space , @xmath18 is occupied by a connected chaotic sea made up of solutions which separate exponentially fast from one another@xcite .",
    "the remaining 94% of the distribution is made up of tori surrounding stable periodic orbits .",
    "so this oscillator model is far from ergodic .",
    "several ways of solving the harmonic oscillator problem with an ergodic dynamics were developed over the next thirty years , all of them requiring at least two thermostat variables so as to produce chaos everywhere in the oscillator phase space .",
    "an example from 1996@xcite is @xmath19 the two friction coefficients @xmath13 and @xmath20 control the two moments @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "the four differential equations have a stationary and ergodic phase - space distribution , gaussian in all four variables : @xmath23    thirty years after the original oscillator work , in the summer of 2015 , i was spending a day watering trees at our home in ruby valley .",
    "i had the idea of applying `` weak control '' to the harmonic oscillator , using a single thermostat variable for the simultaneous control of _ two _ oscillator moments rather than just one .",
    "successful examples soon followed .",
    "one of them , shown in * figure 10 * is the `` 0532 model '' : @xmath24 because this model _ is _ ergodic@xcite its cross sections have no holes and are simple gaussian functions . but",
    "they take on some interest when colored according to the local values of the lyapunov exponent . despite the time reversibility of the equations of motion the time - reversed trajectory s local ( instantaneous ) values of the largest lyapunov exponent",
    "are unrelated to the largest local exponent going forward in time .",
    "this symmetry breaking is a conservative relative of the dissipative symmetry breaking which generates `` strange attractors '' ( and not `` strange repellors '' ) in nonequilibrium simulations . with the successful application of weak control the original 1984 problem of finding an ergodic thermostat for the harmonic oscillator finally produced several single - thermostat solutions",
    ".    continued exploration of the oscillator phase space is ongoing .",
    "the most recent work i have seen is a collection of _ knots _ , tied in phase space by one or two nos - hoover oscillator trajectories@xcite .",
    "piotr pieranski s internet descriptions and depictions of knots are an enriching experience . knot theory was and is a well - developed field of study going back to kelvin and maxwell . for an introductory look at knots",
    "see the interesting work on the prototypical overhand ( or trefoil ) knot@xcite .",
    "see * figure 11*.      the cecam meetings enriched my life , leading to a sabbatical with harald posch and karl kratky in vienna and another four years later with shuichi nos in yokohama .",
    "work at harald s boltzmanngasse laboratory was intense and productive .",
    "apart from the floor and the high ceiling harald and franz vesely and i covered all of the horizontal surfaces of harald s large laser lab with pictures and projections of tori and cross - sections of chaotic seas@xcite .",
    "the cross - section calculations were time - consuming , taking all night to run , showing up on the screen in the morning in what i recall was a beautiful shade of green .",
    "to assess the improvement in computation i recalculated a cross - section problem on a mac laptop , generating two billion timesteps solving the three differential equations describing the simplest nos - hoover thermostated oscillator : @xmath25 it took exactly two minutes to run , generating about half a billion points for each of the three cross sections : @xmath26 . comparing the 2016 and 1985 computation times gave a speedup of @xmath27 or so in 30 years , somewhat slower than moore s law s prediction , but a very pleasant outcome of the computer revolution .    by 1987 bill and another excellent phd student bill moran ,",
    "had analyzed the isokinetic motion of a point mass falling through a triangular lattice of scatterers .",
    "this is the galton board@xcite , named for the statistician who built one over 100 years ago , to demonstrate the binomial and gaussian distributions caused by scattering . in between collisions the galton - board equations of motion are ; @xmath28 the friction coefficient @xmath29 maintains the squared velocity equal to unity , @xmath30 , as the reader can easily verify .",
    "the dissipation induced by the friction coefficient @xmath13 allows the moving particle to descend , converting field energy to heat which is extracted by the reservoir .",
    "a look at the phase - space cross sections in * figure 12 * shows that the dimensionality of the fractal attractor decreases as the field strength is increased from one , to two , to three , to four . in this last case",
    "the phase space is separated into tori , describing the stable bouncing of the moving particle between two scatterers in the same horizontal row , as well as the chaotic sea which describes the dissipation associated with the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "this problem with its motion on a three - dimensional energy surface in the four - dimensional phase space , was one of the earliest to show the multifractal phase - space distributions characterizing time - reversible deterministic dissipative systems .",
    "i am very grateful to all my colleagues for support , wisdom , collaborations , friendship , and love over the years .",
    "i am particularly grateful to berni alder for his extending a helping hand in so many ways that proved crucial to the good life i have enjoyed .",
    "his generosity in presenting an inspiring talk at the sheffield conference was a very welcome eightieth birthday gift .",
