    "much of the initial interest and subsequent research on the hypothesis that we live on an embedded , timelike submanifold ( the brane ) of a higher dimensional ( @xmath0 ) lorentzian spacetime ( warped or unwarped ) was focused on the assumption that the scale of the extra dimension is independent of the coordinates .",
    "the original work of randall and sundrum ( rs ) @xcite on warped braneworlds , published a decade ago , did refer to the idea of the scale of the extra dimension being spacetime dependent , while addressing the issue of stability , in a two  brane scenario .",

    "usually , generic statements ( eg . existence of orbits of different types , oscillatory / exponential behaviour in trajectories , focusing and defocusing etc . ) and their relation to variations in the metric functions , are difficult to extract , though the primary goal in such studies ( on geodesics ) must always be so .    over the years",

    "the brane is dynamically generated as a scalar field domain wall ( soliton ) in the bulk .",

    "in such a scenario , for the timelike case ( @xmath54 ) , the eqs ( [ eq : sigma ] ) and ( [ eq : chi ] ) resemble the following equations , @xmath86 which are qualitatively similar to a dynamical system representing simple harmonic motion ( shm ) @xmath87 ( modulo a multiplicative factor ) . from this consideration",
    ", one can intuitively argue that the eqs ( [ eq : eta])-([eq : chi ] ) will have oscillatory solutions for @xmath79 and @xmath88 ( though , not _",
    "simple _ harmonic ) . on the other hand , for a decaying warp factor , @xmath89 , the above set of equations given by ( [ eq : argu ] ) lead to a system with exponential solutions",
    "thus , there should not be any oscillatory trajectories with decaying warp factors .    from equation ( [ eq : argu ] ) , it is also evident that , for _ any _ growing warp factor one does not have oscillatory timelike trajectories .",
    "for example , in the randall  sundrum scenario , we have , @xmath90 and @xmath91 is therefore a step function , which can not have an expansion with a term linear in @xmath79 .",
    "so there exist no oscillatory solution for this case .    in order to further analyse the behavior of trajectories",
    "analytically , let us look at the specific case where @xmath92 is a constant ( say @xmath93 ) .",
    "since we are particularly interested about motion in the bulk , we choose , @xmath94 ( as @xmath57 does not appear in the other three equations i.e. in ( [ eq : eta ] ) , ( [ eq : sigma ] ) , and ( [ eq : chi ] ) . with these considerations ,",
    "we arrive at following set of equations , @xmath95 for timelike geodesics and growing warp factors , from eqs ( [ eq : sigma1 ] ) and ( [ eq : chi1 ] ) , we obtain , @xmath96 where @xmath97 is an integration constant .",
    "similarly , eqs ( [ eq : eta1 ] ) , ( [ eq : chi1 ] ) and ( [ eq : sigma1chi1 ] ) further lead to , @xmath98 where @xmath99 is another integration constant . now combining the eqs ( [ eq : sigma1chi1 ] ) and ( [ eq : chi1eta1 ] ) ,",
    "one easily obtains , @xmath100 .",
    "\\label{eq : sigma1eta1}\\ ] ] the argument of the `` @xmath101 '' function contains a sinusoidal part which guarantees an oscillatory behaviour of @xmath102 , though its details depend on the parameters ( @xmath97 and @xmath99 ) involved in the analysis .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that even if we let @xmath12 to be a constant , oscillations persist ( only the factor @xmath103 gets replaced by @xmath104 ) .",
    "this confirms that the oscillations are solely due to the presence of a growing warp factor .",
    "it has been checked that , for a decaying warp factor , no such analytic expression can be found .",
    "in fact , the eqs ( [ eq : eta ] ) , ( [ eq : sigma ] ) and ( [ eq : chi ] ) form a dynamical system of their own , irrespective of equation ( [ eq : x ] ) . unfortunately , with @xmath54 , this system does not have any fixed points for a finite value of @xmath34 .",
    "but , for a static extra dimension , we can investigate the solution space @xcite for the following set of two equations , @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 signatures denote the decaying and growing warp factors respectively .",
    "it can easily be shown that the point @xmath108 is a saddle point in the phase space for the decaying warp factor and a centre in case of a growing warp factor .",
    "thus , we can expect oscillatory solutions for @xmath72 and @xmath109 in the latter case ( i.e. for a growing warp factor ) .",
    "we present the phase space plots of @xmath79 and @xmath88 with two different warp factors in the fig .",
    "[ fig : phaseplot1 ] .",
    "a decaying warp factor only helps a particle to move away from the brane , except for the initial conditions satisfying @xmath110 ( where the particle tends toward the location of the brane with an ever - decreasing velocity ) .",
    "this essentially means that only for the abovementioned initial conditions , particles will end up accumulating near the brane with increasing affine parameter .",
    "particles with initial condition @xmath111 will be repelled away from the brane .",
    "there are two other kinds of trajectories .",
    "the trajectories in the quadrants ( @xmath112 ) and ( @xmath113 ) may cross the brane at some point of time ( depending on the initial conditions ) , and the trajectories in the quadrants ( @xmath114 ) and ( @xmath115 ) will bypass the location of the brane ( though they may come very close , depending on the initial conditions ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the closed curves , in the case with a growing warp factor , indicate that , @xmath72 and @xmath109 have an oscillatory behaviour .",
    "one can also notice that the nature of the oscillations depend heavily on the initial conditions .",
    "a particle , initially on or close to the brane and having a small velocity , executes an almost sinusoidal oscillation .",
    "this oscillatory pattern will tend towards a square wave profile as the distance of the launching point from the brane , or the initial velocity , increases .",
    "the phase portraits in fig .",
    "[ fig : phaseplot1 ] are for a static extra dimension .",
    "we expect to see a similar solution space for a dynamic extra dimension ( @xmath92 ) too when @xmath116 because according to our choices @xmath92 gets stablised to a constant value for large @xmath34 .",
    "the closed trajectories for a static extra dimension and a growing warp factor would become limit cycles in phase space when we have a dynamic extra dimension .",
    "one may also note that for null geodesics , the eigenvalues of the linearised system at the origin in the phase space vanishes .",
    "it is therefore not possible to comment on the solution space for this case .",
    "the full geodesic eqs ( [ eq : etaeqn])-([eq : sigmaeqn ] ) for the null and timelike geodesics can obviously be solved numerically .",

    "the initial conditions for our numerical evaluations are chosen as @xmath117 at @xmath118 and @xmath119 at @xmath118 is calculated by using the null and timelike constraints which differs between models .",
    "we have observed that for a growing warp factor , the timelike geodesics have an oscillatory behaviour for both the cases ( i.e. set ( a ) and ( b ) ) as presented in figs .",
    "[ numgeo4_1 ] and [ numgeo8_1 ] respectively .",
    "such an oscillatory behaviour is absent in the trajectories of null geodesics in all the cases .",
    "this essentially means that massless particles are free to escape into the bulk .",
    "the oscillatory behaviour of the timelike geodesics for a growing warp factor also manifests itself in terms of the potential @xmath120 as shown in figs .",
    "[ numgeo4_1 ] and [ numgeo8_1 ] for set ( a ) and set ( b ) respectively .",
    "the fact which is worth mentioning about these trajectories is that a massive particle never moves away to an infinite distance from the location of the brane .",
    "it seems that the trajectories are automatically localised on or near the brane in the presence of a growing warp factor .",
    "the potential in this case is in fact that of an anharmonic oscillator where both the amplitude and frequency of the oscillations are monotonically increasing and converging towards a limiting value with an increasing @xmath56 .",
    "we will again return to the interpretation of this feature in terms of the warp factor and the scale of the extra dimension , in the section [ comparisonavp ] . our numerical findings in this section tally well with the results found earlier in section iii , via the analysis of an autonomous dynamical system derived from geodesic equations .",
    "in order to figure out the effects of warping and a time dependent extra dimension , we will compare the generalised braneworld scenario ( discussed in the previous section ) with the situations where we do not have any warp factor or a time dependence in the extra dimension scale .",
    "let us first consider , the metric ( [ eq : cmetric ] ) without the warping factor .",

    ", we have considered @xmath132 and @xmath133 for the purpose of numerical computations .",
    "the differences between the two subcases are quite clearly visible .",
    "we have also worked through other similar cases , which we do not mention here .",
    "it is clear that the oscillatory behaviour is due to the presence of a growing warp factor ( as already argued in section iii ) . if we compare fig .",
    "[ fig : comparing ] with fig .",
    "[ numgeo4_1 ] , where scale of the extra dimension is dynamic , the increase in the amplitude and frequency of the oscillations of @xmath79 , may be understood as an effect of the decay in the scale of the extra dimension @xmath92 .",
    "in fact , the scale @xmath92 , as mentioned before , can be viewed as the length of an anharmonic oscillator which tends to become a harmonic one with an increasing value of the affine parameter . in other words ,",
    "this problem is equivalent to a problem of a particle in a one dimensional box whose size is decreasing and tending to a finite value .",
    "this is exactly how one can understand the increase in the amplitude of the oscillation in @xmath72 , in fig .",
    "[ numgeo4_1 ] , and its eventual stabilisation to a limiting value .",
    "such features are also evident from the behaviour of the corresponding potentials as given in the figs .",
    "[ numgeo4_1 ] and [ fig : comparing ] .",
    "let us try to understand the above - mentioned confinement from a different point of view .",
    "it was shown in @xcite , that in the case of a five dimensional bulk with a static extra dimension and a growing warp factor ( which is indeed a solution of five dimensional einstein equations in presence of a negative bulk cosmological constant ) , we have confinement of test particles .",
    "further , in @xcite , it was shown that confinement will be achieved if the following energy condition holds , @xmath134 where , @xmath135 are the four basis vectors and @xmath136 and @xmath137 are five and four dimensional coordinate systems respectively . @xmath138 and @xmath139 are ricci tensors in the bulk and on the @xmath140 hypersurface respectively .",
    "the above condition implies that the local gravitational density of five dimensional bulk matter , as measured by an observer freely falling along a hypersurface @xmath85 ( or the brane ) , has to be greater than the gravitational density of the effective four dimensional matter .",
    "for the five dimensional geometry given by eq .",
    "[ eq : cmetric ] , the above constraint leads to @xmath141 it may be noted that for a static extra dimension , i.e. when @xmath142 , the following condition , @xmath143 is sufficient for confinement of test particles .",
    "this condition is clearly satisfied for the functional form of the growing warp factor we have considered .",
    "now the constraint eq .",
    "[ eq : conf_cond1 ] is always satisfied for a monotonically growing warp factor with a growing @xmath12 and a growing but decelerating @xmath92 . in that case , if @xmath92 does not stabilise , then as @xmath116 , the depth of the potential well tends to zero ( as @xmath92 appears in the denominator of eq .",
    "[ eq : vs ] ) . as a result",
    ", confined trajectories will become more and more unstable against perturbations and particles should disappear from the brane .",
    "this observation should rule out the models with growing and divergent @xmath92 , for example , some of the power law solutions ( for @xmath3 ) found in @xcite , in presence of different bulk matter fields as such . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath92 grows but stabilises to a finite value as @xmath116 , trajectories are confined , though become less strongly bound as the depth of the potential decreases ( towards a limiting value ) .",
    "the last two terms in the left hand side of [ eq : conf_cond1 ] are always negative for a growing @xmath12 and a decaying @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , it is obvious that the inequality [ eq : conf_cond1 ] will not always hold for any set of metric functions ( though it happens to be the case for the metric functions we choose ) .",
    "however , one can argue that as @xmath92 stabilises with @xmath116 , constraint [ eq : conf_cond1 ] converges toward constraint [ eq : conf_cond2 ] .",
    "it is thus implied that confinement will eventually be achieved during the course of cosmological evolution .",
    "the trajectories , in this case , will also be more strongly bound as the depth of the potential well increases .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that , if @xmath92 decays to a zero value , the depth the potential [ eq : vs ] tends to infinity resulting in an ever - growing amplitude of oscillation which eventually diverges .",
    "this aspect may help us rule out models with the @xmath92 decaying to zero ( instead of stabilising to a finite limiting value ) .",
    "one may also find a constraint on the warp factor , for confinement , in a static bulk in the following simple way .",
    "for the test particles ( moving along the extra dimension ) to be confined somewhere in the bulk , their geodesic potential should have a minimum at that point .",
    "now the corresponding geodesic potential is given by @xmath144 where @xmath145 is , a positive constant , dependent on the initial conditions .",
    "@xmath120 should have a minima at @xmath146 , where @xmath147 , if the following condition holds @xmath148 which means the @xmath6 must be a monotonically growing function of @xmath79 about the location where the potential has a minimum . for @xmath149 , @xmath150 .",
    "the minimum value of this potential for timelike geodesics is @xmath151 ( where @xmath152 ) at @xmath85 and it reaches its maximum value @xmath153 as @xmath154 .",
    "therefore the zero energy trajectories are bounded within the @xmath79 values which can be obtained by equating @xmath155 .",
    "this leads to @xmath156 we can therefore explain the confinement of massive particles in the context of figs [ numgeo4_1 ] and [ numgeo7_1 ] . on the other hand , for null geodesics , the zero energy trajectories always have runaway features ( figs .",

    "we note that whenever eq .",
    "[ eq : conf_cond ] is true , the eq .",
    "[ eq : conf_cond2 ] is automatically satisfied .",
    "this also justifies why geodesics in a thick braneworld model with growing warp factor i.e. @xmath157 are confined near @xmath85 , whereas with a decaying warp factor we do nt see such confinement .",
    "to conclude , we provide below a summary of the results obtained , in a systematic way .    *",
    "we have studied geodesics for the warped background geometry of a thick braneworld model with a cosmological metric on the brane and a time dependent extra dimension , in detail .",
    "our choices for the scale factors ( marked as set ( a ) and set ( b ) throughout this article ) illustrate situations corresponding to decelerating ( i.e. set ( a ) ) and accelerating ( i.e. set ( b ) ) universes . the extra dimensional scale is chosen appropriately which stabilises to a constant value at large time . * the geodesic equations in such a background can be rewritten as a first order autonomous dynamical system .",
    "analytical insights as well as some specific solutions can therefore be obtained . in particular , the analysis of these equations as a dynamical system shows the role of the warp factor ( growing / decaying ) in controlling the nature of the solutions ( oscillatory / exponential ) . * apart from a few specific cases , the geodesic equations , in general , can only be solved numerically since they are highly coupled differential equations .",
    "however , we are able to demonstrate some qualitative features of the dynamical system through numerical investigations . detailed features of the null and timelike geodesics are brought out for different cases with growing and decaying warp factors .",
    "it may be noted that a numerical estimation is always possible for any other combination of scale factors / warp factor .",
    "* we have tried to separate out the individual effects of the warp factor and the extra dimensional scale factor .",
    "it is found that the emergence of an oscillatory behaviour in timelike geodesics ( absent in the case of null geodesics ) is essentially due to the presence of a growing warp factor .",
    "it seems that massive particles are constrained to be confined near the brane in this particular scenario ( growing warp factor ) , while massless particles like photons or gravitons can indeed access the bulk .",
    "this observation is important in the context of localisation of fields on the brane .",
    "the behaviour of localisation of test particles in a geometry with a growing warp factor is reminiscent of fermion localisation with a growing warp factor . even in the presence of a decaying warp factor",
