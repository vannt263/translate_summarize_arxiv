    "recently , the generalizations of the logarithmic and exponential functions have attracted the attention of researchers .",

    "the latter notation permits us to write simple relations as : @xmath28 or @xmath29 , bringing the inversion point around @xmath30 .",
    "these relations lead to simpler expressions in population dynamics problems  @xcite and the generalized stretched exponential function  @xcite contexts .",
