    "<S> transitions in the qualitative behavior of chemical reaction dynamics with a decrease in molecule number have attracted much attention . here , a method based on a markov process with a tridiagonal transition matrix is applied to the analysis of this transition in reaction dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the transition to bistability due to the small - number effect and the mean switching time between the bistable states are analytically calculated in agreement with numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a novel transition involving the reversal of the chemical reaction flow is found in the model under an external flow , and also in a three - component model . </S>",
    "<S> the generality of this transition and its correspondence to biological phenomena are also discussed . </S>"
