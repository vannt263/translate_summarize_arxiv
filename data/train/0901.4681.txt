    "the production of the standard model higgs boson in photon - photon collisions represents an interesting mechanism for measuring the partial width @xmath0 with a @xmath1 accuracy at an upgrade option of the international linear collider ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , the computation of radiative corrections to the leading order ( lo ) decay width  @xcite has been an active field of research in the last years .",
    "qcd corrections to the partial width of an intermediate - mass higgs boson have been computed at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in  @xcite and at next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) in  @xcite .",
    "the nlo result has been extended in  @xcite to the entire higgs - mass range .",
    "electroweak nlo corrections have been evaluated in  @xcite in the large top - mass scenario and in  @xcite assuming a large higgs - mass scenario .",
    "the two - loop corrections due to light fermions have been derived by the authors of  @xcite , and electroweak effects due to gauge bosons and the top quark have been evaluated through an expansion in the higgs external momentum in  @xcite .",
    "more recently , all electroweak corrections at nlo have been computed in  @xcite for a wide range of the higgs mass , including the region across the @xmath2-pair production threshold .",
    "it has been shown that the divergent behavior of the amplitude at a two - particle normal threshold can be removed introducing the complex - mass scheme of  @xcite , a program carried out in  @xcite .",
    "note that we have not addressed the issue of re - summing coulomb singularities , as performed by the authors of  @xcite",
    ".    in section  [ sec : sings ] of this note we review the implementation of the complex - mass scheme in the two - loop computation and the effect on the two - particle threshold region .",
    "next , in section  [ sec : num ] , we discuss the numerical impact of the nlo electroweak corrections on the partial width @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath3 amplitude shows a divergent behavior around two - particle normal thresholds , related to the presence of square - root and logarithmic singularities in the variable @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the higgs mass and @xmath6 , with @xmath7 , stands for the mass of the @xmath2 ( @xmath8 ) boson or the top quark .",
    "square - root singularities are related to : 1 ) derivatives of two - point one - loop functions , associated with higgs wave - function renormalization ; 2 ) derivatives of three - point one - loop integrals , generated by mass renormalization ; 3 ) genuine irreducible two - loop diagrams containing a one - loop self - energy insertion .    concerning the higgs wave - function renormalization factor at one loop , it is possible to explicitly prove that the coefficient of the derivative of the two - point one - loop integral involving a top quark contains a positive power of the threshold factor @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , square - root singularities associated with wave - function renormalization appear only at the @xmath10 and @xmath11 thresholds .",
    "r0.6        we consider now genuine two - loop diagrams containing a self - energy insertion ; they naturally join terms induced by one - loop mass renormalization as shown in figure  [ fig1 ] , where bosonic and fermionic diagrams are illustrated .",
    "fermionic diagrams of figure  [ fig1]c and figure  [ fig1]d are @xmath9-protected at threshold , and do not require any special care .",
    "the two - loop irreducible diagram of figure  [ fig1]a can be cast in a representation where the divergent part is completely written in terms of the one - loop diagrams of figure  [ fig1]b .",
    "moreover , it is possible to check explicitly that the @xmath12 behavior generated by the two - loop diagram exactly cancels the @xmath12 divergency due to one - loop @xmath2-mass renormalization performed in the complex - mass scheme .",
    "therefore , at the amplitude level , square - root singularities are confined to the higgs - boson wave - function renormalization factor ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "l0.7        as thoroughly discussed in  @xcite , logarithmic singularities are generated by the bosonic diagram of figure  [ fig2 ] , whereas top - quark terms are @xmath9-protected at threshold .",
    "a pragmatic gauge - invariant solution to the problem of threshold singularities due to unstable particles for the @xmath13 decay has been introduced and formalized in  @xcite . in this setup ( minimal complex - mass scheme )",
    "the amplitude is written as the sum of divergent and finite terms , and the complex - mass scheme of  @xcite is introduced for all gauge - invariant divergent terms .",
    "the minimal complex - mass ( mcm ) scheme allows for a straightforward removal of unphysical infinities .",
    "real masses of unstable gauge bosons are traded for complex poles in divergent terms , also at the level of the couplings , gauge - parameter invariance and ward identities are preserved and the amplitude has a decent threshold behavior , as shown in figure  [ fig3 ] for the nlo electroweak corrections to the @xmath13 decay width ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "r0.43        however , the mcm scheme does not deal with artificial cusps associated with the crossing of gauge - boson normal thresholds , as shown in figure  [ fig3 ] for the @xmath15 threshold . in order to cure these effects , in  @xcite",
    "we have performed a full implementation of the complex - mass scheme in the two - loop computation . in the complete complex - mass ( cm ) setup ,",
    "real masses are replaced with complex poles and the real part of the @xmath2-boson self - energy , stemming from mass renormalization at one loop , is traded for the full expression , including its imaginary part . as shown in figure  [ fig3 ] , the full introduction of the cm scheme leads to a complete smoothing of the corrections ( @xmath16 ) at threshold .",
    "a more striking effect is associated with the production of a higgs boson through gluon - gluon fusion as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "numerical results for the percentage nlo electroweak corrections to the partial width @xmath0 are shown in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "all light - fermion masses have been set to zero in the collinear - free amplitude and we have defined the @xmath2- and @xmath8-boson complex poles by @xmath17,\\ ] ] with @xmath18 . as input parameters for the numerical evaluation",
    "we have used the following values for the masses and the widths of the gauge bosons : @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "decay ; see text for details . ]    in figure  [ fig4 ] we have shown qcd corrections ( @xmath23 ) , electroweak contributions in the mcm and cm setups ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) and the full nlo prediction involving both electroweak effects in the complex - mass scheme and qcd ones ( @xmath25+@xmath23 ) .",
    "we observe that qcd and electroweak corrections almost compensate below the @xmath15 threshold , as shown by  @xcite , leading to an overall very small correction , well below the expected @xmath1 accuracy at the planned linear collider operating in the @xmath26 option . above the @xmath15 threshold , instead",
    ", both corrections are positive and lead to a global @xmath27 effect for @xmath28 gev .",
