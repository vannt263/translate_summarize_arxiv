    "the study of fe - based superconductors  @xcite continues unveiling fascinating new discoveries at a fast pace . among the most recent developments is the report of superconductivity in the intercalated iron selenides k@xmath5fe@xmath6se@xmath0 and ( tl , k)fe@xmath6se@xmath0.@xcite in addition , at the special composition k@xmath5fe@xmath7se@xmath0 with the iron vacancies in a @xmath8 arrangement , neutron scattering studies@xcite of this ( insulating ) compound have revealed an unusual magnetic order .",
    "this magnetic state involves 2@xmath22 iron blocks with their four spins ferromagnetically ordered , large ordering temperatures , and concomitant large magnetic moments @xmath93.3  @xmath10/fe .",
    "the 2@xmath22 blocks are antiferromagnetically coupled among them .",
    "phase separation tendencies have also been reported in this type of insulators.@xcite photoemission experiments for ( tl , k)fe@xmath11se@xmath0 revealed a fermi surface with only electron - like pockets at wavevectors @xmath12 and @xmath13),@xcite showing that the fermi surface nesting of hole and electron pockets is not sufficient to understand these materials.@xcite    the developments described above suggest that progress in the understanding of chalcogenides could be made if the iron spins are arranged differently than in the nearly square lattice geometry of the fese layers .",
    "for this reason considerable interest was generated by recent studies@xcite of bafe@xmath0se@xmath1 ( the `` 123 '' compound ) since this material contains chains made of [ fe@xmath0se@xmath1]@xmath15 building blocks separated by ba .",
    "these effective two - leg iron ladders in bafe@xmath0se@xmath1 are cut - outs of the layers of edge - sharing fese@xmath16 tetrahedra normally found in layered chalcogenides .",
    "each double chain consists of pairs of iron atoms ( the `` rungs '' ) located one next to the other forming a one dimensional arrangement perpendicular to those rungs , defining indeed a two - leg ladder structure . in the context of the cu - oxide high - t@xmath17 superconductors ,",
    "spin 1/2 two - leg ladders have also been much studied because of their unusual spin gap , induced by the ladder geometry .",
    "the cu - oxide - ladder spin state is dominated by rung spin - singlets , and a tendency to superconduct upon doping.@xcite in particular , the compound srcu@xmath0o@xmath1 is the cu - based analog of bafe@xmath0se@xmath1.@xcite    a recent remarkable development that increases the relevance of the iron - based ladders is the following .",
    "the preparation of a single layer of alkali - doped fese with the geometry of weakly coupled two - leg ladders was recently reported in ref .  , where it was also argued that this ladder system is superconducting based on the presence of a gap in the local density of states .",
    "these results suggest that fe - based ladders provide a simple playground where even superconductivity can be explored , increasing the similarities with the cu - oxide ladders that are also superconducting.@xcite    bafe@xmath0se@xmath1 is an insulator , with a resistivity displaying an activation energy between @xmath18@xmath90.13  ev ( ref .  ) and @xmath18@xmath90.178  ev ( ref .  ) .",
    "the 123-ladder compound has long - range antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order at @xmath9250  k , with low - temperature magnetic moments @xmath92.8  @xmath10 , and it displays short - range afm correlations at higher temperatures ( in particular @xmath19@xmath935@xmath20 at room-@xmath21).@xcite upon cooling , the magnetic order presumably settles along the ladder directions first , and then weaker interladder interactions establish the long - range order .",
    "neutron diffraction studies@xcite reported a dominant magnetic order at low-@xmath21 involving blocks of four iron atoms with their moments aligned , coupled antiferromagnetically along the ladder direction ( fig .  1 , top state ) .",
    "this state is sometimes dubbed the plaquette state , but here it will be referred to as the `` block - afm '' state or just `` block '' .",
    "the ferromagnetic 2@xmath22 building blocks present in the block - afm state of the ladders are the same blocks reported before in k@xmath5fe@xmath7se@xmath0 , with the iron vacancies in the @xmath22@xmath2@xmath22 distribution .",
    "when the 123-ladder material is doped with k as in ba@xmath23k@xmath24fe@xmath0se@xmath1 , experimentally it is known that the magnetic state evolves from the block - afm state , through a spin glass , eventually arriving for kfe@xmath0se@xmath1 to the spin state labeled `` cx '' also displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where the spins in the same rung are coupled ferromagnetically but they are antiferromagnetically ordered in the long ladder direction.@xcite note that in bafe@xmath0se@xmath1 the valence of fe is expected to be 2 + , if those of ba and se are + 2 and -2 , respectively , giving an electronic density @xmath4=6.0 .",
    "but in kfe@xmath0se@xmath1 , k has valence + 1 , thus rendering the average valence of fe to be + 2.5 , that corresponds to an electronic density @xmath4=5.5 .",
    "-0.3 cm    -0.5 cm [ fig1 ]    in the present publication , results for multiorbital hubbard models are reported .",
    "the lattice distortions@xcite are partially taken into account via the hopping amplitudes , as described below .",
    "however , part of our results presented in the following sections show that even without lattice distortions the 2@xmath22 block - afm state is stable in regions of the phase diagrams that are constructed by varying the on - site hubbard repulsion @xmath25 , the hund coupling @xmath26 , and the electronic density @xmath4.@xcite in other words , our most important result is that several models , studied with several approximations , systematically contain the block - afm state as a robust phase in the phase diagram .",
    "moreover , the other recently observed@xcite cx - state is also found in the resulting phase diagrams .",
    "several competing states that could be stabilized in related compounds or under pressure or via chemical doping are also discussed .",
    "the present study is carried out mainly using the hartree - fock approximation for the five - orbital hubbard model , employing both a set of hopping amplitudes that are deduced from first principles techniques applied to the selenide 123 ladders , as explained below , and also an `` old '' set of hopping that was previously employed in layered pnictides .",
    "the purpose of using two sets of hoppings is to gauge how sensitive the results are with regards to modifications in those hopping amplitudes .",
    "in addition , our results for pnictide hoppings can be considered predictions in case two - leg ladder pnictides are synthesized in the future .",
    "results for a reduced two - orbital hubbard model using lanczos@xcite and the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg)@xcite techniques are also presented here , also for two sets of hoppings .",
    "overall , the two phases observed experimentally in neutron scattering , the block - afm and the cx states , are stable in regions of the phase diagram centered at the realistic hund coupling @xmath27 . with regards to phase diagrams , gaps , magnetic moments , and competing states ,",
    "a reasonable qualitative agreement is found between the two different hopping sets , and for the different number of orbitals considered in our effort .",
    "studies of the spin - fermion two - orbital model@xcite using monte carlo simulations@xcite also provide a phase diagram compatible with those of the hubbard models .",
    "in this section , the focus will be on the derivation of the hopping amplitudes needed for the five - orbital hubbard model and in providing details of the real - space hartree - fock technique employed .",
    "the models used in this publication have all been extensively discussed before , thus details will not be repeated . in particular ,",
    "the five - orbital hubbard model is explicitly defined in ref .  .",
    "with regards to the hopping amplitudes for the 123-ladder compounds , here they have been calculated using first - principles techniques , as explained below .",
    "these hoppings will be refereed to as the selenide hoppings in the rest of the publication.@xcite for completeness , results using the hoppings corresponding to layered pnictides  @xcite will also be used , and the results compared with one another .",
    "while the data gathered with the realistic selenide hoppings are our most important set of results , contrary to naive expectations it will be shown that a reasonable agreement is observed between these two `` a priori '' quite different sets of hopping amplitudes , at least at a qualitative level .",
    "the electronic density of main interest is , in principle , @xmath28 ( i.e. 6 electrons / fe ) , thus our efforts are centered at this density , but some results varying @xmath4 are shown below as well ( or verbally described ) . as explained before , the on - site intraorbital hubbard repulsion is @xmath25 , the hund coupling is @xmath26 , and the interorbital repulsion @xmath29 is assumed to satisfy @xmath29=@xmath25 - 2@xmath26 .",
    "ladders of sizes 2@xmath2@xmath30 ( @xmath30=4 , 8 , 16 , 32 ) were studied , and size effects were found to be mild .",

    "the matrices are written in the orbital basis @xmath31 for the on - site energy and inter - orbital hopping ( @xmath32 ) , nearest - neighbors hoppings ( @xmath33 , both along the rungs and the legs ) and next - nearest - neighbors hoppings ( @xmath34 ) .",

    "[ fig4 ] for the two - orbital hubbard model were obtained by using the hopping parameters originally developed for pnictide compounds . as also addressed for the case of the five - orbital hubbard model ,",
    "this is a crude approximation for bafe@xmath0se@xmath1 because the hopping parameters are material - dependent making it imperative a study of the two - orbital hubbard model with a set of hoppings corresponding to the true 123-ladder selenide compound .",
    "this more realistic set of parameters was obtained by fitting tight - binding models to the band structure first - principles results discussed in sec .",
    "ii in the context of the five - orbital hubbard model .",
    "letting @xmath37 be the hopping matrix defined in the orbital space @xmath38 along the @xmath39 and @xmath40 directions between nearest and next - nearest iron atoms , the set of hoppings for two orbitals can be obtained , and they are shown in the second column of table  [ tablehops ] ( `` 123 compound '' column ) .",
    "note that the five - orbitals results had the long direction along the @xmath35 axis , but here a rotation was carried out and the long direction is along the @xmath36 axis .",
    "for the two - leg ladder used in the dmrg calculations , the presence of the se atoms with a staggered location above and below the fese ladders in the 123 material imply that the `` unit cell '' must be larger than in the absence of that lattice distortion.@xcite the other small lattice distortion along the ladder legs incorporated in the five - orbitals results also demand such an enlarged unit cell .",
    "however , this doubling of the unit cell increases the complexity of the dmrg calculation because operators for the additional iron atoms belonging to the enlarged unit - cell must be kept .",
    "then , in order to simplify the dmrg computation , approximations ( discussed in the next paragraph ) will be introduced to reduce the problem to a two - orbital hubbard model where all fe - fe bonds along the leg direction are equivalent .",
    "the final set of hoppings used in our dmrg calculation are shown in the `` dmrg hoppings '' column shown in table  [ tablehops ] .",
    "they were obtained by averaging hoppings along the same direction but for different bonds .",

    "the assignments of the many phases are decided based on the wavevector of the dominant peak in the spin structure factor .",
    "the `` pm '' ( paramagnetic ) phase was assigned based on the similarity with the @xmath45 results , and for this reason the frontier between the pm and magnetic phases may not be precise .",

    "( c ) same as ( b ) but for the block - afm state with wavector @xmath49 , at @xmath48 , @xmath27 , and @xmath50 , using @xmath51 , @xmath41 , and @xmath52 clusters.,width=321 ]      the results obtained with the dmrg technique applied to the two - orbital hubbard model using the hoppings for selenides described in the previous subsection are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.5.dmrg ] .",
    "technical details are the same as in the case of the pnictides hoppings .",
    "panel ( a ) contains the phase diagram from the wavevectors that dominate in the spin structure factor .",
    "panels ( b , c ) display the behavior of the spin structure factor at particular couplings , for the two most important states .",
    "similarly as in the case of the hoppings for pnictides , at @xmath44 there is a dominance of the cx state .",
    "in fact , the region of stability of this cx state is larger with the selenides hoppings than with the pnictides hoppings .",
    "this may lead to the conclusion that for new ladder compounds synthesized in the future the cx state should be more likely to appear than the block - afm state . or it could be that our analysis does not include a lattice distortion that favors the block - afm state over the cx - state .    with regards to the block - afm state , in fig .",
    "[ fig.5.dmrg ]  ( a ) it is shown that this phase indeed exists in the regime of hole doping , contrary to the case of the hoppings for pnictides where the block - afm state was found for electron doping , in a region of approximately the same size in the phase diagram .",
    "not finding this state at precisely @xmath44 is not a problem since the actual population of the @xmath53 and @xmath54 orbitals is not precisely 2 in the real materials .",
    "what is perhaps more surprising is the dominance of the cx - state over the block - afm state , contrary to the results of the five - orbitals model where the latter was fairly stable .",
    "this result highlights the shortcomings of the two - orbitals model . in the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig.5.dmrg ] other phases not observed experimentally are found such as the cy - state and the fm - state , again similar to the case of the hoppings for pnictides or for the five - orbitals models .",
    "while the precise location of the phases varies from model to model and depends on the hoppings , the systematic presence of the block - afm and cx states is clear in our results .",
    "however , as in the case of the pnictides hoppings , it is important to remark that the agreement between five- and two - orbitals calculations is qualitative at best .",
    "for instance , consider the case of @xmath55 and @xmath56 in fig .",
    "[ fig.5.dmrg ]  ( a ) . here , as in the case of the pnictides hoppings fig .",
    "[ fig4 ]  ( a ) , the cx state dominates in the range of @xmath42 explored .",
    "however , for the case of five - orbitals at @xmath57 and @xmath56 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ]  ( a ) , it is the block - afm state that dominates .",
    "thus , only by including variations in the electronic density @xmath4 is that similarities between the two cases do emerge .      complementing these studies , the two - orbital spin - fermion model for the pnictides  @xcite",
    "was also analyzed using a 2@xmath216 cluster and monte carlo ( mc ) techniques , employing approximately 50,000 mc steps ( not shown ) . at @xmath58 and @xmath59  ev",
    ", the cx state was found , while at @xmath60 and a similar range of @xmath26 the block - afm state was found , in agreement with the lanczos and dmrg studies .",
    "results will be presented in future publications .",
    "using five- and two - orbital models for the two - leg ladder compounds bafe@xmath0se@xmath1 and kfe@xmath0se@xmath1 , the phase diagram of these models were studied using several many - body techniques .",
    "the richness of the reported phase diagrams demonstrates that fe - based superconductors are more complex than early investigations based on fermi surface nesting ideas anticipated.@xcite more specifically , in this study it has been argued that the experimentally observed cx and 2@xmath22 block - afm states shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] are indeed the ground state of purely electronic hubbard models in robust regions of parameter space when varying @xmath42 , @xmath26 , and the electronic density @xmath4 , at least within the hf approximation .",
    "our effort suggests that to understand the stability of the 2@xmath22 block states , theoretical studies of electronic models using the geometry of two - leg ladders ( much simpler than a full two - dimensional layer ) may be sufficient , although for a quantitative description quantum fluctuations and the effect of lattice distortions may be needed .",
    "our study also predicts that several other magnetic phases could become stable in the vicinity of the cx and block - afm states in the phase diagram .",
    "the other candidates are in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and the list includes the g - afm , cy , and fm states , and to a lesser extent the flux and t states . the experimental search for these states via chemical substitution or pressure would be important to improve the interplay between theory and experiments for the fe - based superconductors . since these magnetic arrangements are",
    "close in energy , glassy behavior caused by a multiplicity of energy minima is also possible.@xcite finally , by comparing results using two sets of hopping amplitudes ( one realistic for the ladder selenides and obtained via first - principles calculations , and another borrowed from pnictides investigations ) , several similarities were unveiled particularly at intermediate and large hubbard couplings .",
