    "many applications of quantum systems are placed in a realm close to classical behavior , where nevertheless quantum properties need to be taken into account . in view of the more complicated structure of quantum systems , both of a conceptual as well as technical nature",
    ", it is then often helpful to work with equations of classical type , i.e.systems of ordinary differential equations for mechanical systems , which are amended by correction terms resulting from quantum theory . from a mathematical point of view",
    ", the question arises how well the behavior of a ( wave ) function subject to a partial differential equation can be approximated by finitely many variables subject to a system of coupled but ordinary differential equations .",
    "one very powerful method is that of effective actions @xcite which have been developed and are widely used for quantum field theories .",
    "the effective action of a free field theory is identical to the classical action , while interacting theories receive quantum corrections `` from integrating out irrelevant degrees of freedom . ''",
    "the language is suggestive for the physical intuition behind the formalism , but the technical details and the mathematical relation between classical and quantum theories remain less clear .    in this article",
    "we develop , building on earlier work @xcite , a geometrical picture of effective equations of motion for a quantum mechanical system with a clear - cut relation between the classical and quantum system : as a manifold , a classical phase space of the form @xmath0 can literally be embedded into the quantum system .",
    "also the scchrdinger equation can be formulated as hamiltonian equations of motion for quantum phase space variables , and self - adjoint operators as observables in quantum theory select special functions on the quantum phase space which can be considered as observables of the classical type .",
    "we discuss several examples and show that , in the regime where effective action techniques can be used , they coincide with our method .",
    "for any system with classical action @xmath1 $ ] as a functional of the classical coordinates @xmath2 , thus satisfying @xmath3 in the presence of an external source @xmath4 , one can formally define the effective action @xmath5 $ ] satisfying the same relation @xmath6 but containing @xmath7-dependent quantum corrections .",
    "if the generating functional @xmath8 $ ] of greens functions is known , @xmath9 is obtained as the legendre transform of @xmath10 $ ] @xcite .",
    "this procedure is well - motivated from particle physics where additional contributions to @xmath9 can be understood as resulting from perturbative quantum interactions ( `` exchange of virtual particles '' ) . indeed , effective actions are mostly used in perturbative settings where the generating functional @xmath11 can be computed by perturbing around free theories , using e.g.  gaussian path integrations .    for other systems , or quantum mechanical applications ,",
    "( [ effeq ] ) can , however , be seen at best as a formal justification .",
    "the effective action can rarely be derived in general , but its properties can make an interpretation very complicated .",
    "first , @xmath9 is in general complex and so are the effective equations ( [ effeq ] ) as well as their solutions .",
    "in fact , @xmath2 in ( [ effeq ] ) is not the classical @xmath2 and not even the expectation value of @xmath12 in a suitable state of the quantum system .",
    "instead , in general it is related to non - diagonal matrix elements of @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "secondly , @xmath9 is in general a non - local functional of @xmath2 which can not be written as the time integral of a function of @xmath2 and its derivatives . in most applications ,",
    "one employs a derivative expansion assuming that higher derivatives of @xmath2 are small . in this case , each new derivative order introduces additional degrees of freedom into the effective action which are not classical , but whose relation to quantum properties of , e.g. , the wave function is not clear either .",
    "indeed , in this perturbative scheme , not all solutions of the higher derivative effective action are consistent perturbatively as many depend non - analytically on the perturbation parameter @xmath7 @xcite . for those solutions ,",
    "it is then not guaranteed that they capture the correct perturbative behavior considering that next order corrections , non - analytical in the perturbation parameter , can dominate the leading order .",
    "such non - analytical solutions have to be excluded in a perturbative treatment , which usually brings down the number of solutions to the classical value even if perturbative corrections are of higher derivative form @xcite . the description , even in a local approximation ,",
    "can thus be quite complicated , given by higher derivative equations with many general solutions subject to the additional condition that only solutions analytic in the perturbation parameter are to be retained .",
    "the formulation is thus very redundant if higher derivative terms are used .",
    "moreover , where there seem to be additional ( quantum ) degrees of freedom associated with higher derivative corrections , their role remains dubious given that many solutions have to be excluded .",
    "there are other technical difficulties if one tries to generalize beyond the usual realm of perturbing around the ground state of a free field theory or , in quantum mechanics , the ground state of a harmonic oscillator . in the latter case , for a system with classical action @xmath13=\\frac{1}{2}m\\dot{q}^2-\\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2q^2-u(q)\\ ] ] one can derive the effective action @xcite ( see also ref .",

    "the quantum system is here described effectively in an expansion around the ground state of the harmonic oscillator . on the other hand",
    ", a quantum system allows more freedom and one could , e.g. , want to find an effective formulation for a quantum system which is prepared to be initially close to a squeezed state , or a state of non - minimal uncertainty . this freedom is not allowed by the usual definition of an effective action .",
    "other problems include the presence of `` infrared problems '' : in the free particle limit , corresponding to a massless field theory , one has @xmath15 for which ( [ effac ] ) becomes meaningless . still , at least for some time the free particle should be possible to be described in an effective classical manner . other generalizations , such as for systems to be perturbed around a hamiltonian non - quadratic in momenta as they occur , e.g. , in quantum cosmology ,",
    "look even more complicated since one could not rely on gaussian path integrations .",
    "for all these reasons it is of interest to develop a scheme for deriving effective equations of a quantum system based on a geometrical formulation of quantum mechanics .",
    "this has been used already in the context of quantum cosmology @xcite where usual techniques fail . as we show here",
    ", it reduces to the effective action result ( [ effac ] ) in the common range of applicability , but is much more general .",
    "moreover , it provides a clear , geometrical picture for the relation between the dynamics of classical and quantum systems , the role of quantum degrees of freedom and the effective approximation .",
    "the formalism of quantum theory has been studied for almost a century already and a prominent understanding of its structure , based mainly on functional analysis , has been achieved .",
    "from this perspective , quantum mechanics appears very different from classical mechanics not only conceptually but also mathematically .",
    "while in classical physics the viewpoint is geometrical , employing symplectic or poisson structures on a phase space , quantum theory is analytical and based on hilbert space structures and operator algebras .",
    "there are , however , some contributions which develop and pursue a purely geometrical picture of quantum mechanics , in which the process of quantization and kinematical as well as dynamical considerations are generalizations of classical structures .",
    "the process of quantization is described in a geometrical , though not always constructive , manner in geometric quantization @xcite , employing line bundles with connections , but the picture of the resulting theory remains analytical based on function spaces and operators thereon .",
    "independently , a geometrical formulation of quantum mechanics has been developed which , irrespective of the quantization procedure , provides a geometrical viewpoint for all the ingredients necessary for the basic formulation of quantum physics @xcite .",
    "it is the latter which will be crucial for our purposes of developing a geometrical theory of effective equations of motion and the classical limit .",
    "let us assume that we are given a quantum system , specified by a hilbert space @xmath16 with underlying vector space @xmath17 equipped with inner product @xmath18 , together with an algebra of basic operators and a hamiltonian @xmath19 .",
    "the hamiltonian defines a flow on @xmath20 by @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath22 be a hilbert space .",
    "the inner product @xmath18 on @xmath20 defines a khler structure on @xmath17 .    to start",
    "with we note that the inner product can be decomposed as @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote the real and complex parts of @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "it follows from the properties of an inner product that @xmath27 is a metric and @xmath28 a symplectic structure on the vector space @xmath17 , identified with its tangent space in any of its points . also by definition ,",
    "the metric and symplectic structure are related to each other by @xmath29 with the obvious complex structure , @xmath30 is thus khler .    as used in the proof ,",
    "points and tangent vectors of the khler manifold @xmath31 correspond to states in the hilbert space , and functions densely defined on @xmath17 can be associated to mean values of operators acting on @xmath20 : any operator @xmath32 on @xmath20 defines a function @xmath33 on @xmath34 taking values @xmath35 in points @xmath36 of its domain of definition .",
    "any state @xmath37 defines a constant vector field on @xmath38 , which can be used to compute the lie derivative @xmath39 this allows us to show    let @xmath40 be a function on @xmath34 associated with a self - adjoint operator @xmath32 on @xmath20 .",
    "its hamiltonian vector field is given by @xmath41    using the definition of a lie derivative and self - adjointness of @xmath32 we have @xmath42 for any vector @xmath43 , from which @xmath44 can immediately be read off .",
    "such vector fields are also known as schrdinger vector fields , as their flow is generated on @xmath20 by a schrdinger equation @xmath45 the flow is a family of unitary transformations , i.e.  automorphisms of the hilbert space which preserve the hilbert space structure .",
    "therefore , the flow preserves not only the symplectic structure of @xmath34 , as any hamiltonian vector field does , but also the metric .",
    "hamiltonian vector fields thus are killing vector fields , and since each tangent space has a basis of killing vectors the khler space is maximally symmetric .    for two functions @xmath46 and @xmath47 the symplectic structure defines the poisson bracket @xmath48\\rangle\\,.\\ ] ] for , e.g. , @xmath49 and @xmath50 we have @xmath51 from @xmath52=i\\hbar$ ]",
    ".    of physical significance in quantum theory are only vectors of the hilbert space up to multiplication with a non - zero complex number .",
    "physical information is then not contained in the vector space @xmath17 but in the projective space @xmath53 .",
    "from now on we will take this into account by working only with norm one states and norm - preserving vector fields ..",
    "for any quantum system , the algebra of basic operators , which is a representation of the classical algebra of basic phase space variables defined by poisson brackets , plays an important role .",
    "we will assume mainly , for simplicity , that this basic algebra is given by a set of position and momentum operators , @xmath54 and @xmath55 for @xmath56 , with canonical commutation relations .",
    "this distinguished set of operators leads to further structure on @xmath38 :    the set of fundamental operators @xmath57 on @xmath58 defines a fiber bundle structure on @xmath17 where the bundle projection identifies all points @xmath59 , @xmath36 for which @xmath60 and @xmath61 for all @xmath62 .",
    "the base manifold can be identified with the classical phase space as a manifold .",
    "the hilbert space used for the quantization of a classical system is always infinite dimensional , which implies that the fibers of the bundle are infinite dimensional .",
    "for instance , for an analytic wave function one can consider the collection of numbers associated to the mean values of products of the fundamental operators , @xmath63 and @xmath64 for all @xmath65 .",
    "usually denominated by the name of hamburger momenta @xcite , the @xmath66 are a complete set in the sense that they uniquely determine the wave function .",
    "indeed , from linear combinations @xmath67 of the hamburger momenta with coefficients corresponding to some orthogonal polynomials , taking hermite polynomials @xmath68 for definiteness , we have @xmath69 giving the absolute value of the wave function as @xmath70 the @xmath71 , on the other hand , provide information about the phase @xmath72 of the wave function up to a constant : @xmath73 from which @xmath74 is determined as before , using the already known norm of @xmath36 .",
    "one could thus use hamburger momenta as coordinates on the fiber bundle , but for practical purposes it is more helpful to choose coordinates which are not only adapted to the bundle structure but also to the symplectic structure .",
    "we thus require that , in addition to the classical variables @xmath75 and @xmath76 , coordinates of the fibers generate hamiltonian vector fields symplectically orthogonal to @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the _ quantum variables _ of a hilbert space @xmath20 are defined as @xmath79 with respect to fundamental operators @xmath80 where round brackets on indices denote symmetrization .",
    "variables of this type have been considered in quantum field theories ; see , e.g. , @xcite . together with the classical variables , they provide in particular local trivializations of the quantum phase space as a fiber bundle .",
    "the fiber coordinates @xmath81 on @xmath34 are symplectically orthogonal to the classical coordinates @xmath82 .",
    "we compute the poisson bracket with @xmath83 to obtain @xmath84\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\sum_{k=0}^n ( -)^k(^n_k)\\left[k\\epsilon^{j(i_n}x^{i_1}\\!\\ !",

    "an alternative proof proceeds by computing the poisson bracket between the function @xmath86 and @xmath83 , restricting to the dense subspace in which such functions are analytic in @xmath87 , and expanding .",
    "since the fibers are symplectic , @xmath28 defines a natural decomposition of tangent spaces of @xmath34 as a direct sum of a vertical space tangent to the fibers and a horizontal space @xmath88 as the symplectic complement :    @xmath89 is a fiber bundle with connection over the classical phase space @xmath90 as base manifold .",
    "we now know the poisson relation between the classical variables @xmath82 and between @xmath82 and the @xmath91 . in order to compute the remaining poisson brackets",
    "@xmath92 for @xmath93 canonical degrees of freedom we introduce a new notation @xmath94 the label `` weyl '' meaning that the product of operators is weyl or fully symmetric ordered .",
    "the notation allows us to drop indices whose values are zero so whenever we are dealing with a single pair of degrees of freedom we use the notation where @xmath95 .",
    "the poisson brackets for the variables above are @xmath96with indices running as @xmath97 and coefficients given by @xmath98 where @xmath99    consider first the poisson bracket between functions of the form @xmath100 . for analytical wave functions in the mean values , @xmath101 is an analytical function and so is the poisson bracket between two such functions @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "we can therefore take the coefficients in a taylor expansion for all orders in @xmath103 and @xmath104 . using the relation @xmath105=2",

    "the fibers of @xmath34 as a fiber bundle over the classical phase space are not vector spaces , and the quantum variables @xmath123 are not allowed to take arbitrary values .",
    "similarly , not any collection of numbers is a collection of hamburger momenta . with @xmath34 being a khler space ,",
    "the fibers are bounded by relations following from schwarz inequalities .",

    "the boundary , obtained through saturation of the inequalities , is characterized by relations which result from the lemma order by order in @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "the dynamical flow of the quantum system is given as the unitary schrdinger flow on @xmath20 of a self - adjoint hamiltonian operator @xmath19 .",
    "as before , this flow is also hamiltonian when viewed on the khler space @xmath34 .",
    "it is generated by the hamiltonian function obtained as the mean value of the hamiltonian operator . in terms of coordinates on the manifold the hamiltonian function is obtained by taylor expanding the mean value of the hamiltonian operator which in our convention is taken to be weyl ordered :    the _ quantum hamiltonian _ on @xmath34 is the function @xmath147 generating _ hamiltonian equations of motion _",
    "@xmath148    this hamiltonian flow is equivalent to the schrdinger equation of the hamiltonian operator . as such , it is an equivalent description of the quantum dynamics and only superficially takes a classical form , albeit for infinitely many variables , in its mathematical structure .",
    "nevertheless , the reformulation makes it possible to analyze the classical limit in a direct manner , and to derive effective equations in appropriate regimes .",
    "classical dynamics is to arise in the limit of  small \" quantum fluctuations which , when the fluctuations are completely ignored or switched off by @xmath149 , should give rise to classical equations of motion . in practice , this limit is not easy to define , and the most direct way is to derive first effective equations of motion , which still contain @xmath7 , and then take the limit @xmath149 .    in this procedure ,",
    "the main problem is to reduce the infinite set of coupled quantum equations of motion to a set of differential equations for only a finite set of variables .",
    "additional degrees of freedom without classical analogs carry information about , e.g. , the spreading of the wave function around the peak , which itself is captured by expectation values . for a formulation of classical type , taking into account only a finite number of degrees of freedom , a system has to allow a _ finite - dimensional _ submanifold of the quantum space @xmath34 which is preserved by the quantum flow .",

    "a strong effective classical system agrees with the quantum system both at the kinematical and quantum level since its symplectic structure as well as the hamiltonian flow are induced by the embedding .",
    "as such , the conditions are very strong since they require a quantum system to be described _",
    "exactly _ in terms of a _ finite dimensional _ system @xmath152 .",
    "in addition to agreement between the strong effective and the quantum dynamics , the first condition ensures that the classical variables are contained in @xmath152 and fulfill the classical poisson relations .",
    "in the simplest case we require the effective system to have the same dimension as the classical system , such that potentially only correction terms will appear in @xmath159 ( to be discussed further in theorem  [ strongeffham ] below ) but no additional degrees of freedom .",

    "sometimes one may be forced to keep an odd number of quantum variables , such as the three @xmath160 , in the system which we allow by requiring the effective phase space @xmath152 to be only pre - symplectic . for a strong effective system of the classical dimension , however , the dynamics of the quantum variables in the embedding space occurs only as a functional dependence through the classical coordinates : @xmath161 the effective equations of motion , generated by @xmath159 are then obtained by inserting solutions @xmath162 in the equations for @xmath82 : @xmath163",
    "we now demonstrate the applicability of the general procedure by presenting examples , which will then lead the way to a weakened definition and , in the following section , a proof that the results coincide with standard effective action techniques when both can be applied .    harmonic oscillator the quantum hamiltonian ( [ hq ] ) for a harmonic oscillator",

    "this implies that any truncation of the system by including only a finite set of values for @xmath166 , which as already seen is consistent with the dynamical equations , and choosing initial conditions to be that of a coherent state gives a base horizontal subspace as required by def .",

    "in other words , the harmonic oscillator allows an infinite set of strong effective classical systems , including one of the classical dimension .",

    "in particular , for @xmath175 we see that the uncertainty relations are saturated . for other states ,",
    "the quantum variables will in general vary during evolution , which means that the spreading of states changes in time .",
    "nevertheless , the variables remain bounded and the system will stay in a semiclassical regime of small uncertainties if it starts there . with varying @xmath27 , we will not obtain a strong effective system as horizontality will be violated .",
    "nevertheless , such states are often of interest and suitable for an effective description , which we will provide in a weakened form later on .",
    "linear systems the harmonic oscillator is a special case of systems , where a complete set of functions on the classical phase space exists such that they form a lie algebra with the hamiltonian . for such systems , which we call linear , semiclassical aspects can be analyzed in an elegant manner using _ generalized coherent states _ : a family of states  of the dimension of the algebra minus the dimension of its subalgebra that generates the stability subgroup of a given , so - called extremal state  with respect to which the mean values of operators can be approximated very well by their classical expressions @xcite .    in this example",

    "the dynamics of infinitely many degrees of freedom thus decouples into infinitely many sectors containing only finitely many variables .",
    "this shows    [ integrablecorr ] any linear quantum system admits a class of finite dimensional subspaces preserved by the quantum flow , including one of the classical dimension .",
    "this is not sufficient for the existence of a strong effective system , for which we also have to discuss base horizontality . as in the harmonic oscillator example",
    ", one can try to use coherent states which have been widely analyzed in this context .",
    "nevertheless , the issue of base horizontality , i.e.  finding coherent states for which all @xmath27 are constant , in general is more complicated .",
    "a special family of states is generated by acting with the lie algebra on an extremal state , i.e.  a lowest weight of a module representation , which can thus be seen to be in one - to - one correspondence with the factor space of the lie algebra by the stabilizer of the state .",
    "more explicitly those states are of the form @xmath194 where @xmath195 is a representation of the lie algebra , @xmath28 is the quotient of the group manifold by its stabilizer , @xmath196 is an extremal state , @xmath197 for all positive roots @xmath121 and @xmath198 or @xmath199 are coordinate charts of the homogeneous space .",

    "we thus have to weaken not only the condition of a preserved embedding , but also its horizontality . since we are interested in effective equations only up to a certain order in @xmath7 , which we already used in the dynamics of this example , it is reasonable to require constant @xmath27 also only up to terms of some order in @xmath7 .",

    ", one can already see that basic properties are the same : first , the harmonic oscillator ground state ( or any coherent state ) gives a quantum dynamics with constant quantum variables such that the quantum hamiltonian differs from the classical one only by a constant .",
    "effective equations of motion are then identical to the classical ones , which agrees with the usual result . if there is an anharmonic contribution to the potential , however , the evolution of classical variables depends on the quantum variables , and moreover there is no finite set of decoupled quantum variables .",
    "thus , for an exact solution all infinitely many quantum variables have to be taken into account , and in general _ no strong effective system exists_. this is the analog of the non - locality of the standard effective action which in general can not be written as a time integral of a functional of the @xmath75 and finitely many of their time derivatives . in standard effective actions ,",
    "a derivative expansion is an important approximation , and similarly we have to weaken our definition of effective systems by introducing approximate notions .",

    "we expand @xmath265 .",

    "however , solutions of these equations , perturbative or exact , are in general not single valued functions of the classical variables and therefore an exactly preserved semiclassical submanifold does not exist .",
    "in fact , we have    let @xmath278 be a quantum mechanical system such that @xmath279 .",
    "if @xmath151 admits a strong effective system of the classical dimension then @xmath278 is linear .    by assumption",
    ", we have an embedding of the classical phase space into the quantum phase space such that the quantum flow is everywhere tangential to the embedding and the classical symplectic structure is induced .",
    "we can thus take the quantum hamiltonian vector field and choose additional horizontal vector fields generated by functions @xmath191 on @xmath34 such that they span the tangent space to @xmath280 in each point @xmath281 . since , by construction , the collection of all those vector fields can be integrated to a manifold , they are in involution .",
    "vector fields on the bundle , finally , correspond to linear operators on the hilbert space having the same commutation relations as the poisson relations of the generating functions .",
    "there is thus a complete set of operators of the quantum system which includes the hamiltonian and is in involution .",
    "the notion of a strong effective system then does not allow enough freedom to include many physically interesting systems .",
    "indeed , the dynamics of a strong effective system does not significantly differ from the classical one :    [ strongeffham ] for any strong effective system of classical dimension , @xmath282 differs from the classical hamiltonian only by a constant of order @xmath7 .    from the preceding lemma it follows that a strong effective system can exist only when the hamiltonian is at most quadratic in the complete classical phase space functions @xmath191 . in an expansion as in ( [ hqexpand ] )",
    "we then have only the linear order in @xmath7 containing @xmath160 .",
    "since by assumption the strong effective system is of the classical dimension , horizontality implies that the @xmath160 are constant .",
    "thus , @xmath283 with a constant @xmath284 , and @xmath285 directly gives the effective hamiltonian .",
    "if quantum degrees of freedom are included in a strong effective system of dimension higher than the classical one , they are then only added onto the classical system without interactions , which is not of much interest . on the other hand , for effective equations",
    "one is not necessarily interested in precisely describing whole orbits of the system , for which single valued solutions @xmath286 would be required , but foremost in understanding the local behavior compared to the classical one , i.e.  modifications of time derivatives of the classical variables .",
    "the conditions for a strong effective system , however , are requirements on the whole set of orbits of the system . thus ,",
    "as noted before , we have to weaken our definition of effective systems .",
    "we first do so in a manner which focuses on the finite dimensionality of classical systems but ignores more refined notions of semiclassicality :    [ effsys ] an _ effective system of order @xmath266 _ for a quantum system @xmath287 is a dynamical system @xmath288 , i.e.  a finite - dimensional manifold @xmath289 together with an effective flow defined by the vector field @xmath290 , which can locally be embedded in the khler manifold @xmath34 associated with @xmath291 such that it is _ almost preserved _ :",

    "an effective system in this sense allows one to describe a quantum system by a set of finitely many equations of motion , as we encountered it before in the examples .",
    "the only concept of classicality is the finite dimensionality , while otherwise the quantum variables included in the effective system can change rapidly and grow large even if an initial state has small fluctuations .",
    "moreover , the finite dimensional space of an effective system is not required to be of even dimension or , even if it is of even dimension , to be a symplectic space . in general",
    ", it is only equipped locally with a pre - symplectic form through the pull - back of @xmath28 on @xmath34 .",
    "a stronger notion , taking these issues into account , is    [ hameffsys ] a _ hamiltonian effective system @xmath150 of order @xmath266 _ for a quantum system @xmath151 is a finite - dimensional subspace @xmath152 of the khler manifold @xmath34 associated with @xmath20 which is    1 .",

    "we ensure that the commutator algebra of the quantum system , which determines the symplectic structure on @xmath34 , is reflected in the symplectic structure of the effective system .",
    "moreover , as in the previous definition the dynamics of the effective system is close to the quantum dynamics . still , the effective hamiltonian is not directly related to the quantum hamiltonian : one generally expands the quantum hamiltonian in powers of @xmath7 , solves some of the equations of motion for @xmath167 and reinserts solutions into the expansion . nevertheless , to low orders in @xmath7 most fluctuations can be ignored and it is often possible to work directly with the quantum hamiltonian as the expectation value in suitably peaked states .",
    "this is the case for effective equations of quantum cosmology @xcite where this procedure has been suggested first .    in this definition",

    "in general , its dynamics will not be close to the effective dynamics , but there are usually regimes where this can be ensured for at least some time starting with appropriate initial states . also the symplectic structure @xmath299 can differ from the classical one .",
    "this is realized also for effective actions such as ( [ effac ] ) , where the symplectic structure also receives correction terms of the same order in @xmath7 as the hamiltonian .",
    "the effective and classical symplectic structures are close if the embedding of @xmath152 in @xmath34 is `` almost horizontal '' which can be formalized by requiring that for any @xmath300 and @xmath301 there is a @xmath302 such that @xmath303 is of some appropriate order in @xmath7 .",
    "we do not make this definition of almost horizontality more precise since it turns out not to be needed to reproduce usual effective action results .",
    "moreover , its practical implementation can be rather complicated : the quantum cosmology example showed that the order to which one can ensure almost horizontality is not directly related to the order in @xmath7 to which equations of motion are expanded .",
    "if one has an almost horizontal embedding , ignored quantum degrees of freedom remain almost constant such that they do not much influence the evolution for an appropriately prepared initial state . but",
    "not any system can be approximated in this manner , and so the condition of almost horizontality implies that for some systems only higher dimensional hamiltonian effective systems exist .",
    "in such a case there are some quantum degrees of freedom which can by no means be ignored for the effective dynamics . on the other hand ,",
    "in such a case it may be difficult to guarantee the existence of a symplectic structure .",
    "this happens , for instance , if the @xmath160 change too rapidly , but not higher @xmath27 .",
    "one can then use a 5-dimensional effective system with variables @xmath304 which can only be pre - symplectic and thus not hamiltonian . alternatively",
    ", one can drop the condition of almost horizontality , but then has to accept a new ( pre-)symplectic structure which is not necessarily related to the classical one by only correction terms .",
    "these constraints show that a discussion of quantum variables in higher - dimensional effective systems can be complicated if one insists on the presence of a canonical structure .",
    "moreover , computing the symplectic structure on the khler space and its pull - back to the effective manifold in an explicit manner is usually complicated ( see , however , sec .  [ dyncohstates ] for a brief discussion ) .",
    "we thus present a final definition which does not require an explicit form of the quantum symplectic structure but is sufficient for the usual setting of effective actions :    an _ adiabatic effective system of order @xmath305 _ for a quantum system @xmath151 is an effective system @xmath306 of order @xmath266 in the sense of def .",

    "this viewpoint is still much more general than the usual definition of an effective action , and it allows much more freedom by choosing different finite - dimensional subspaces . for an explicit derivation of effective equations , of course , one has to find solutions @xmath308 as they appear in the quantum hamiltonian , which requires one to solve an infinite set of coupled differential equations for infinitely many variables . only in exceptional cases , such as integrable systems ,",

    "the vacuum state was used here in order to fix the constants @xmath327 which appear when integrating equations of motion for quantum variables .",
    "one can just as well choose different constants , for instance those corresponding to a squeezed state , and obtain the corresponding effective equations .",

    "this can become non - zero only at higher orders in the expansion .    or , while one would always include the classical variables in the effective system , they can be accompanied by some of the quantum variables which are not treated as adiabatic .",
    "one can include such quantum degrees of freedom directly as defined on the quantum phase space , or introduce them by perturbing quantum variables around the adiabatic solution , @xmath344 .",
    "new degrees of freedom given by @xmath345 are then independent of the classical variables and describe quantum corrections on top of the adiabatic one .",
    "there are also situations where no distinguished state such as the vacuum is known , as it happens in the example of quantum cosmology discussed earlier .",
    "general effective equations can then still be formulated but contain free parameters incorporating the freedom of choosing an initial state in which the system is prepared .",
    "the constants @xmath327 in the above proof , for instance , would then remain unspecified and appear in effective equations . to the same order as considered here , only the constant @xmath346 enters which will appear in general equations of motion .",

    "we do not have a complete proof for arbitrary systems , but using the fact that the assumption of the state being semi - classical requires the mean values of operators to be given by their classical expressions up to @xmath7 corrections , a case by case study leads to the conclusion that the positive mean values above lead to positivity of the operator .    furthermore , the state of the quantum system as given above is not in general a pure state , but if @xmath371 also @xmath372 has trace one and thus gives a pure state which can be realized as a squeezed coherent state labeled by the symmetric matrix @xmath373 through @xmath374 with the help of @xmath375 , the remaining fiber coordinates become @xmath376    reconstructing a dynamical coherent state from the quantum variables @xmath167 also provides means to compute the symplectic structure on the effective space , as needed for a hamiltonian effective system as per def .",
    "[ hameffsys ] . for the evaluation of the symplectic structure on the vector fields we obtain the pull - back @xmath377 where @xmath378 and @xmath11 are tangent vectors to the embedded effective manifold .",
    "given a dynamical coherent state @xmath379 as a function of classical variables @xmath380 , we can define a basis of the tangent space spanned by @xmath381 .",
    "expanding @xmath382 and @xmath383 , we have @xmath384 such that we can formally write @xmath385 thus , the pull - back of the symplectic structure to the subspace of squeezed states is @xmath386 for an effective system of the classical dimension , corresponding to a set of solutions @xmath387 , we can further pull back ( [ omegasqueezed ] ) to the classical manifold and obtain the quantum symplectic structure there .",
    "this shows that the classical symplectic structure is reproduced up to corrections of order @xmath7 if the @xmath127 do not change strongly ( adiabaticity or almost horizontality ) , and provides means to compute those correction terms .",
    "comparison with common effective action techniques applicable to an - harmonic oscillators demonstrates how effective systems can be formulated more generally for any quantum system .",
    "we have extracted several definitions which have different strengths and use different mathematical structures : @xmath388{diagrama.eps}\\ ] ] here , the strengths of each of our definitions are compared in a condensed diagram by use of implication arrows and abbreviations in which the initial s holds for strong , h for hamiltonian , a for adiabatic and es for effective system . the only definition not provided before is that of a strong hamiltonian effective system which is a hamiltonian effective system which is _ exactly _ preserved and whose symplectic structure is _ exactly _ the pull - back of the quantum symplectic structure .",
    "it is clear from the discussions before that any strong effective system is also strong hamiltonian , and examples lead to the conjecture that the converse is also true .",
    "still , since we are not aware of a proof , we include strong hamiltonian effective systems in this diagram .",
    "while the definition of hamiltonian effective systems is most geometrical , adiabatic effective systems turn out to be more practical and are more directly related to path integral techniques .",
    "the weakest notion of an effective system can be applied to any system but does not incorporate many classical aspects except for finite dimensionality for mechanical systems .",
    "as the examples showed , in particular that of quantum cosmology , the general definitions provided here are more widely applicable and also present a more intuitive understanding of possible quantum degrees of freedom .",
    "moreover , they are always switched on perturbatively , and no non - analyticity in perturbation parameters as with higher derivative effective actions arises .",
    "the expansion of the quantum hamiltonian also showed that in general half - integer powers of @xmath7 have to be expected in correction terms and not just integer powers as often stated .",
    "the only exception is the first order in @xmath263 which does not appear because the expectation value of variables @xmath389 would be zero by definition .",
    "half - integer powers do not appear only if one has a system with a hamiltonian even in all canonical variables , such as an an - harmonic oscillator with an even potential , as it often occurs in quantum field theories .",
    "these observations are relevant for quantum gravity phenomenology because an expansion in the planck length @xmath264 naturally involves half - integer powers in @xmath7 . from the perspective provided here one can expect all integer powers of the planck length except for the linear one .",
    "other advantages are that the effective equations have a geometrical interpretation where only real variables , unlike @xmath390 in the usual definition , occur .",
    "we are dealing directly with equations of motion displaying only the relevant degrees of freedom , which are automatically provided with an interpretation as properties of the wave function , and can directly deal with canonical formulations in which the scheme indeed arises most naturally .",
    "the techniques are general enough for arbitrary initial states and systems with unbounded hamiltonians , as demonstrated by our quantum cosmology example .",
    "the infrared problem of ( [ effac ] ) for @xmath391 is seen to arise only in the adiabatic approximation , but can easily be treated by using more general notions of effectivity such as by including the spreading parameters @xmath160 in a pre - symplectic effective system .    as discussed briefly in the preceding section , techniques introduced here can also be used directly at the quantum level and not just for effective semiclassical approximations . in this context , we have presented only first steps , but this already shows that the techniques can give information on dynamical coherent states .",
    "this will then also have helpful implications for the effective equation scheme itself from which such states arise , as they can give a handle on computing the pull - back of the full symplectic structure .",
