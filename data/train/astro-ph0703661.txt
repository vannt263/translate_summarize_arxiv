    "clusters of galaxies are fascinating astrophysical objects and laboratories for studying galaxy formation and structure formation in general . at the same time , clusters can provide cosmological constraints that are complementary to those obtained with other methods such as temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background , type ia supernovae , and weak lensing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and provide key evidence for the existence and properties of dark matter @xcite .",
    "all cosmological applications of clusters , at least to a certain degree , rely on solid understanding of the physics of their formation . given that clusters are nonlinear collapsed systems , numerical cosmological simulations are the method of choice for their theoretical studies .",
    "modern cosmological codes using @xmath2-body and numerical hydrodynamics techniques can accurately follow dynamics of dark matter and gaseous baryonic components in their full complexity during the hierarchical build - up of structures . yet , more realistic modeling of clusters requires inclusion of additional baryonic processes .",
    "for example , to model formation of cluster galaxies , we need , at the very least , to correctly treat energy dissipation due to radiative losses by baryons , and conversion of gas into stars . in addition ,",
    "any feedback in the form of energy injection and metal enrichment from supernova winds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", such comparisons were used extensively to put constraints on the deviations of icm thermodynamics from the simple self - similar behavior , described originally by @xcite .",
    "the first studies of the observed correlation of cluster x - ray luminosity , @xmath3 , and spectral temperature , @xmath4 , unambiguously showed that its slope is steeper than the slope predicted by the self - similar model ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "in addition , the slope of the @xmath5 relation steepens for the lowest mass clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "deviations from self - similarity were shown to be the strongest in the cores of clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and were widely interpreted as evidence for preheating of the intracluster gas by energy from supernovae and agn feedback ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "alternative explanation was proposed by @xcite , who argued that cooling and condensation of the gas accompanying formation of cluster galaxies can reduce the icm gas density and increase its temperature and entropy to the observed levels ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this explanation was borne out by cosmological simulations @xcite .",
    "however , the amount of gas that condenses out of the hot icm in cosmological simulations due to cooling ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) appears to be a factor of 2 - 3 too large compared to the observed stellar mass in clusters @xcite .",
    "thus , the x - ray measurements appear to be consistent with a large fraction of cooling gas , while the optical estimates of stellar mass indicate that this fraction is small .",
    "modern x - ray observations with _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ allow us to study the icm properties with unprecedented detail and accuracy .",
    "their superb spatial resolution and sensitivity enable resolved , accurate x - ray brightness and temperature maps over a large fraction of the cluster virial radii .",
    "the x - ray measurements also enable accurate mass modeling of relaxed clusters with the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium of the icm in the cluster potential .",
    "these observations can therefore be used for detailed comparisons of both global cluster properties and their profiles with simulation results , which provide more stringent tests for the models of the icm thermodynamics .",
    "in particular , such comparisons can shed some light on the apparently contradictory lines of evidence as to the efficiency of cooling in clusters described above .    to this end , in the present study we focus on the effects of radiative cooling and star formation on the observable properties of clusters and compare results of simulations in both non - radiative and radiative regimes with the current x - ray data .",
    "namely , we use two sets of simulations started from the same initial conditions .",
    "both sets treat collisionless dynamics of dark matter and hydrodynamics of diffuse gas with high - resolution using the adaptive mesh refinement technique . in the baseline set of cluster simulations ,",
    "the gas is modeled in non - radiative regime and thus does not reach high densities and is not allowed to form stars .",
    "the second set of simulations includes several processes accompanying galaxy formation : gas cooling , star formation , metal enrichment and thermal feedback due to the supernovae .",
    "comparison of the simulated profiles in these two sets of simulations to those of observed clusters allows us to gauge the role of galaxy formation in shaping properties of the icm .",
    "as we show in   [ sec : profiles ] , the simulations that include galaxy formation processes provide a considerably better match to the observed icm profiles outside cluster cores compared to the non - radiative simulations .",

    "<S> we compare two sets of simulations , one performed in the non - radiative regime and another with radiative cooling and several physical processes critical to various aspects of galaxy formation : star formation , metal enrichment and stellar feedback . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the observed icm properties outside cluster cores are well - reproduced in the simulations that include cooling and star formation , while the non - radiative simulations predict an overall shape of the icm profiles inconsistent with observations . in particular , we find that the icm entropy in our runs with cooling is enhanced to the observed levels at radii as large as half of the virial radius . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that outside cluster cores entropy scaling with the mean icm temperature in both simulations and _ chandra _ observations is consistent with being self - similar within current error bars . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the pressure profiles of simulated clusters are also close to self - similar and exhibit little cluster - to - cluster scatter . </S>",
    "<S> we provide analytic fitting formulae for the pressure profiles of the simulated and observed clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray observable - mass relations for our simulated sample agree with the _ chandra _ measurements to @xmath0 in normalization . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this systematic difference could be caused by the subsonic gas motions , unaccounted for in x - ray hydrostatic mass estimates . </S>",
    "<S> the much improved agreement of simulations and observations in the icm profiles and scaling relations is encouraging and the existence of tight relations of x - ray observables , such as @xmath1 , and total cluster mass and the simple redshift evolution of these relations hold promise for the use of clusters as cosmological probes . </S>",
    "<S> however , the disagreement between the predicted and observed fractions of cluster baryons in stars remains a major puzzle . </S>"
