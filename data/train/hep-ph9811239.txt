    "let us next consider the heavy quark potential .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the potential in momentum space is free of linear ir sensitivity .",
    "the linear ir sensitivity of the contribution of the potential to @xmath62 arises in a momentum space calculation from taking its matrix element .",
