    "in this paper , we outline a method for computing the homology of the two double - branched covers of any properly embedded arc in the solid torus . in particular , we use this method to partially answer a question posed by krebes in @xcite .    let @xmath2 be a standardly embedded solid torus @xmath6 . then a genus-@xmath0 tangle is a properly embedded arc in @xmath2 .",
    "just as we may discuss embedding ordinary tangles in @xmath7 into knots and links ( see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) , we may consider embedding genus-1 tangles in knots .",
    "we say that a genus-1 tangle @xmath1 embeds in a knot @xmath4 if @xmath1 can be completed by an arc exterior to @xmath2 to form the knot @xmath4 ; that is , there exists some arc in @xmath8 such that upon gluing this arc to @xmath1 along their boundary points , we have a knot in @xmath9 which is isotopic to @xmath4 .",
    "we say that @xmath4 is a closure of @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath10 denote a longitude for @xmath2 which is contained in @xmath11 and avoids the genus-1 tangle .",
    "a closure @xmath4 of @xmath1 is called odd ( respectively , even ) with respect to @xmath10 if @xmath12 is odd ( respectively , even ) . if @xmath10 is chosen to be the longitude which circles the central hole of @xmath2 as in fig .",
    "[ krebestangle ] , and we span the longitude @xmath10 by a disk @xmath13 filling the hole , then @xmath12 is the number of transverse intersections counted with sign of the arc which completes @xmath1 to @xmath4 with @xmath13 . thus , in this case we can say more colloquially that @xmath4 is an odd ( respectively , even ) closure with respect to @xmath10 if the arc which completes @xmath1 to @xmath4 passes through the hole of @xmath2 an odd ( respectively , even ) number of times .",
    "@xmath10 at 377 185     in @xmath2 together with a specified longitude @xmath10.,height=96 ]    in @xcite , krebes asks whether the genus-1 tangle @xmath5 given in fig .",
    "[ krebestangle ] embeds in the unknot . using the following results from @xcite , we are able to partially answer this question . note that when discussing this example , we always use the longitude @xmath10 drawn in fig .",
    "[ krebestangle ] .",
    "[ ruberman ] suppose @xmath14 is an orientable 3-manifold with connected boundary , and @xmath15 where @xmath16 is an orientable 3-manifold with @xmath17 torsion . then the inclusion map @xmath18 induces an injection of the torsion subgroup @xmath19 of @xmath20 into @xmath17 .",
    "this theorem has a useful corollary which can easily be proved directly using a meyer - vietoris sequence .",
    "[ rubermancor ] let @xmath14 and @xmath16 be as in theorem [ ruberman ] but suppose @xmath21 .",
    "then @xmath22 is torsion - free .",
    "one obtains an obstruction to embedding genus-1 tangles in knots from theorem [ ruberman ] by applying the result to branched covers of @xmath2 branched over genus-1 tangles .    for any genus-1 tangle @xmath1 ,",
    "the homology @xmath23 is free abelian on the two generators given by the meridian @xmath24 of @xmath1 and the longitude @xmath10 of @xmath2 . for a given @xmath25 ,",
    "each @xmath25-fold cover of @xmath2 branched over @xmath1 is associated to a homomorphism @xmath26 which maps @xmath24 to one . the remaining generator @xmath10 of @xmath23 may be sent to any element of @xmath27 ; we use @xmath28 to index the @xmath25-fold branched covers .",
    "so , @xmath29 denotes the @xmath25-fold cover of @xmath2 branched over @xmath1 associated to the homomorphism @xmath30 which maps @xmath10 to @xmath31 .    if a genus-1 tangle @xmath1 embeds in a knot @xmath4 , then the @xmath25-fold cover @xmath32 of @xmath9 branched over @xmath4 restricts to some @xmath25-fold cover @xmath29 of @xmath2 branched over @xmath1 . in this case",
    ", we say that the closure @xmath4 induces the cover @xmath29 .",
    "then according to theorem [ ruberman ] , the torsion subgroup @xmath33 of @xmath34 injects into @xmath35 .    note that",
    "if @xmath4 is the unknot , then @xmath32 is @xmath9 and according to corollary [ rubermancor ] , the torsion subgroup @xmath33 is trivial .",
    "thus , if there is any torsion in the homology of @xmath29 , then any closure of @xmath1 which induces the cover @xmath29 is not the unknot .",
    "ruberman considered using theorem [ ruberman ] to study krebes question about the genus-1 tangle @xmath5 .",
    "he found that ",
    "it seems that the homology of all the cyclic covers of the solid torus , branched along this arc , is torsion - free \" ( see section 5 of @xcite ) .",
    "however , our detailed computation in sections 2 and 3 shows that the two - fold branched cover @xmath36 does have torsion in its homology , and we prove the following results .",
    "[ maintheorem ] if a knot @xmath4 in @xmath9 is an odd closure of @xmath5 , then @xmath37 is divisible by @xmath38 .",
    "[ maincor ] if @xmath5 embeds in the unknot , then the unknot is an even closure of @xmath5 .     where we perform a meridional twist , and the genus-1 tangle which results from the twist.,height=124 ]    before further discussion",
    ", we need to make a remark about the definition of genus-1 tangles .",
    "[ embeddingremark ] note that when defining genus-1 tangles , we fix a standardly embedded solid torus @xmath2 in the 3-sphere .",
    "the reason that we restrict to a fixed embedding is that there are many ways to re - embed a solid torus inside @xmath9 .",
    "for instance , if we perform a meridional twist on @xmath2 along the disk indicated in fig .",
    "[ krebestwist ] , the image of @xmath5 under this twist can be easily seen to embed in an unknot via the exterior arc pictured in fig .",
    "[ krebestwist ] .",
    "thus it is necessary to specify the embedding of @xmath39 in the case of genus-1 tangles , and we restrict to a fixed standardly embedded solid torus in our definition .",
    "for the purposes of this paper , we restrict our attention to double - branched covers of @xmath2 branched over @xmath5 . since a homomorphism @xmath40 must map the specified longitude @xmath10 to either zero or one , there are two double - branched covers , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "we call @xmath41 the even double - branched cover because it is induced by all even closures of @xmath5 ( with respect to @xmath10 ) . similarly , since @xmath42 is induced by all odd closures of @xmath5 , we call it the odd double - branched cover .",
    "in this section , we adapt rolfsen s technique to find surgery descriptions for these double - branched covers .",
    "following @xcite , we perform surgery near a carefully selected crossing ( see fig .",
    "[ surgery ] ) in such a way that after surgery we may essentially unwind @xmath5 ( via sliding its endpoints around the boundary in the complement of @xmath10 ) so that it looks trivial .",
    "this process , illustrated in fig . [ unwind ] , results in a nice surgery description of @xmath5 inside @xmath2 .",
    "note that in the last drawing of fig .",
    "[ unwind ] , we choose to draw this surgery description in a particular way because it makes constructing branched covers easier .     to make it look trivial .",
    "the surgery curve is always given the blackboard framing.,width=465 ]    now we construct the odd cover , @xmath42 .",
    "construction is dictated by the homomorphism @xmath40 corresponding to the cover .",
    "if @xmath30 maps a generator of @xmath43 to a non - zero element , then we cut the solid torus along a disk transverse to that generator .",
    "thus , we have two cuts to make in the case of the odd cover .",
    "first , we cut @xmath2 along a disk which is transverse to the meridian @xmath24 of @xmath5 and whose boundary is made up of the unwound genus-1 tangle @xmath5 together with an arc in @xmath11 .",
    "then , because @xmath30 sends @xmath10 to one , we cut @xmath2 along a disk which is transverse to @xmath10 and whose boundary is contained in @xmath11 .",
    "we then take two copies of the resulting manifold and glue them together carefully to obtain a surgery description for @xmath42 .",
    "this process is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ constructodd ] .    although it is not needed in the proof of theorem [ maintheorem ] , we also give a surgery description of the even double - branched cover @xmath41 in fig .",
    "[ constructeven ] .     of @xmath2 branched over @xmath5.,width=374 ]    .,width=393 ]",
    "now we compute the homology of the odd double - branched cover . from fig . @xmath44",
    "we see that the surgery description for @xmath42 is given by a 2-component surgery link inside a genus-2 handlebody .",
    "we denote the components of the surgery link by @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and let @xmath47 denote the genus-2 handlebody .",
    "the complement of @xmath47 in @xmath9 is a neighborhood of the handcuff graph @xmath48 , pictured in fig .",
    "[ oddhomology ] , which is composed of loops @xmath49 and @xmath50 joined together by an arc",
    ". then the complement of @xmath51 in @xmath47 can be viewed as the complement of @xmath52 in @xmath9 .",
    "one can see that @xmath53 is isomorphic to @xmath54 which is free on four generators : the meridians of @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .      completing the surgery by gluing in two solid tori according to @xmath45 and @xmath46 introduces two relations on these four generators , which are given by the linking numbers of @xmath45 and @xmath46 with each of @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "then @xmath55 is isomorphic to @xmath54 modulo these two relations , and we can get a presentation for @xmath55 using linking numbers .",
    "thus , we have the following presentation matrix for @xmath55 : @xmath56      let @xmath4 be an odd closure of @xmath5 , and let @xmath32 denote the double cover of @xmath9 branched over @xmath4 .",
    "since @xmath4 is an odd closure of @xmath5 , it induces a restriction from @xmath32 to @xmath42 .",
    "then according to theorem [ ruberman ] , we have that @xmath59 .",
    "thus @xmath60 divides @xmath61 .",
    "we are unable to use this method to restrict all closures of @xmath5 because @xmath41 has a torsion - free first homology group .",
    "indeed , the statement in remark [ embeddingremark ] allows us to see that the even cover does embed in @xmath9 and so must have torsion - free first homology .",
    "of course , this can be verified by deriving a presentation for the homology of @xmath41 using the procedure above ."
