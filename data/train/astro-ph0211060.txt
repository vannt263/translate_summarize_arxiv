    "studies of the cluster formation history in different galaxies , based on _ observed _ cluster samples , rarely take into account the fact that clusters may have been disrupted .",
    "we have started a series of studies to disentagle the effects of cluster formation and cluster disruption . here",
    "we present the method for the determination of the disruption time in galaxies with a nearly constant cluster formation rate , with an application to selected regions in four galaxies .",
    "oort [ 12 ] noticed the lack of old open clusters in the solar neighbourhood and derived statistically that galactic clusters disrupt on a timescale of @xmath7 years .",
    "several authors have found that the mean age of clusters in the lmc and smc is larger than that of clusters in the solar neighbourhood and cloncluded that the disruption time must be longer in the mcs ( e.g. [ 9 ] ) .",
    "actually , the disruption time of clusters is expected to depend on their mass and on the local conditions in their host galaxy .",
    "modern observations of large homogeneous cluster samples , e.g. with @xmath8 , enable the determination of the cluster disruption time in different galaxies .",
    "the disruption time of clusters is expected to scale with the relaxation time    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the cluster radius and @xmath11 is the cluster mass ( see e.g. [ 13],[14 ] ) . if all clusters in a limited region of a galaxy had the same radius , then eq .",
    "( 1 ) would imply that @xmath12 .",
    "if the cluster radius depends on its mass as @xmath13 , then we expect @xmath14 with @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a constant that depends on the ambient pressure in the region of the galaxy where the clusters are located .",
    "( obviously , this expected relation does not hold for clusters in highly elliptical orbits . )    in this paper we derive the empirical relation between the disruption time and the mass of clusters in different locations of galaxies , based on the mass and/or age distributions of magnitude limited cluster samples .",
    "suppose that :    1 .",
    "the _ disruption time of clusters _ depends on their initial mass @xmath11 as + @xmath17 + where @xmath1 is the disruption time of a cluster with an initial mass of @xmath18 , 2 .",
    "the _ formation rate of clusters _ is constant , 3 .",
    "the _ initial mass function of clusters _ can be written as @xmath19 , with @xmath20 [ 16 ] , 4 .",
    "_ clusters fade below the detection limit _",
    ", in the wavelength band that determines the magnitude limit of the cluster sample , due to the evolution of their stars as @xmath21 .",
    "the value of @xmath22 can be derived from cluster evolution models , e.g. the starburst99 models of leitherer et al . [ 11 ] .",
    "then it is easy to show that both the age and mass distributions of surviving clusters above a certain magnitude limit will consist of double power laws ( shown in fig .",
    "1 ) of the type : +    * @xmath23  for low mass clusters due to fading * @xmath24  for high mass clusters due to disruption * @xmath25  for young clusters due to fading * @xmath26  for old clusters due to disruption    these relations are derived by boutloukos & lamers [ 4 ] ( hereafter bl02 ) .    the vertical shift of the fading lines in fig .",
    "1 depends on the detection limit of the observations and on the number of clusters formed per unit time in the region of the host galaxy that is studied .",
    "the horizontal shift of the disruption line depends on @xmath1 .",
    "the slope of the disruption line depends on the values of @xmath2 and @xmath27 .",
    "so both @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be derived from the cluster statistics in a simple straightforward way .",
    "these double power laws are strictly valid if the clusters disrupt instantaneously when they reach an age of @xmath28 .",
    "however , it can be shown that gradual cluster disruption results in similar power law distributions ( bl02 ) . in that case",
    "the transition between the two powerlaws is not a sharp bend , but it is more gradual .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "that shows the predicted mass and age distributions in case the cluster mass decreases gradually on a timescale that depends on the mass as in eq .",
    "the full lines are the predicted relations for gradual disruption , whereas the dashed lines are the relations in case of instantaneous disruption .",
    "they show a similar double power law as in fig . 1 , but with a gradual transition .",
    "-axes have arbitrary units .",

    "( figure from bl02 ) , title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]",
    "we have applied this method to samples of clusters observed with @xmath8 in the inner region of m51 by bik et al . [ 3 ] , in m33 by chandar et al .",
    "[ 5],[6],[7 ] and to the cluster samples of the smc by hodge [ 10 ] and of the solar neighbourhood by wielen [ 15 ] .",
    "the distributions indeed show the power - law decrease at high mass and/or high age due to disruption .",
    "figures 3a shows the mass distribution of the m51 cluster sample and fig .",
    "3b shows the age distribution of the m33 cluster sample .",
    "( bl02 also studied the age distribution of clusters in m51 and the mass distribution of clusters in m33 . )",
    "the full lines are the predicted distributions for evolutionary fading below the detection limit for these samples .",
    "( the wiggles at low age or small mass are due to the appearance and disappearance of red supergiants . ) at high age or high mass the observed distributions are powerlaws that clearly decrease much steeper than predicted for evolutionary fading only .",
    "this is due to disruption .",
    "figures 4a and 4b show the age distributions of clusters in the smc and the solar neighbourhood repectively .",
    "the age distribution of the clusters in the smc and the solar neighbourhood show a flat part at young ages , because the clusters do not fade below the detection limit in the samples used .",
    "therefore , the distributions at young age show the constant cluster formation rate . > from the observed powerlaw relations we derived the values of the disruption parameters",
