    "nowadays , the standard model of electronic structure calculations is based on density - functional theory ( dft ) in the kohn - sham ( ks ) formalism @xcite . the dft - ks scheme , also in its simplest approximations like the local - density approximation ( lda ) @xcite or the generalized - gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite , is generally highly successful in a very large variety of applications .",
    "thus , when a lda ( or gga ) ks band structure turns out to be metallic in an insulating compound ( e.g. in a transition - metal oxide ) , the result is often interpreted as a direct indication for strong electron correlation effects in the material , and a failure of the band - structure picture . a possible strategy that has been followed in the literature to overcome these difficulties is to resort to model approaches , like the multiband hubbard model . in the lda+u approach @xcite ,",
    "lda band structures are supplemented by an on - site coulomb interaction ( the hubbard u ) acting only on the `` correlated '' subset of the electronic degrees of freedom . in a higher level of theory , dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) @xcite ,",
    "the hubbard model is further mapped onto an anderson impurity model , which can be then solved with different techniques , allowing for the description of dynamical effects beyond lda+u . in those cases",
    "lda is claimed to be inadequate to capture the strong interactions taking place between correlated electrons in partially filled @xmath2 ( or @xmath3 ) shells , which give rise to narrow bands in the solid .",
    "however , we remark that dft is a ground - state theory and ks band structures are not meant to describe the electronic excitations measured in photoemission , which also define the fundamental band gap of an insulator",
    ". moreover , lda lacks the derivative discontinuity of the local ks exchange - correlation ( xc ) potential @xcite @xmath4 and suffers from a severe delocalization error @xcite , which is particularly relevant for localised @xmath2 and @xmath3 electrons .",
    "the underestimation of the fundamental band gaps in @xmath5 semiconductors is well known@xcite , and understood in terms of self - energy corrections at the gw level of approximation @xcite .",
    "this underestimation sometimes may lead to metallic band structures also in `` weakly correlated '' small - gap semiconductors , like in germanium .    here",
    "we consider several prototypical correlated transition - metal oxides that have been studied by other methods in the past years : vo@xmath0 , v@xmath0o@xmath1 , ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , latio@xmath1 , and ytio@xmath1 . in all the low - temperature insulating phases of these materials , ks - lda yields a metallic band structure .",
    "we thus address the following question : is this just a result of the inadequacy of lda to deal with strong correlations or , rather , is this finding related to the systematic ks - lda underestimation of band gaps that occurs also in `` weakly correlated '' semiconductors and get enhanced in the oxides ? to answer this question we make use of a generalized kohn - sham ( gks ) scheme @xcite , where the local ks xc potential @xmath4 is replaced by a spatially non - local @xmath6 . in these hybrid functionals ,",
    "the non - local fock exchange potential is mixed with the local ( lda or gga ) ks xc potential @xcite . in these approaches ,",
    "the difference with lda results stems solely from the non - local exchange term .",
    "this is not supposed to improve the description of electronic correlation .",
    "therefore , if strong correlations are responsible for invalidating the ks - lda description of these insulators , then one should expect to find the same problems in the gks scheme .",
    "we will instead show how , without invoking strong - correlation effects , the role of non - local exchange is essential to cure most of the lda delocalization error and provide a band - structure description of the electronic properties of several transition - metal oxides in qualitative agreement with the experimental results .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we briefly introduce the generalized kohn - sham ( gks ) scheme and the hybrid - functional parametrization that we use , and compare them with standard methods that treat electronic correlations . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we present and discuss the results that we have obtained for the various transition - metal oxides , also across their metal - insulator phase transitions ( mit ) @xcite . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we draw our conclusions on the basis of these results and discuss the advantages and shortcomings of the use of hybrid functionals in the description of the electronic properties of correlated oxides .",
    "in the gks scheme the xc potential is generalized to be non - local in space@xcite , contrary to ordinary ks where it is local . in this framework ,",
    "a common choice is to write the gks non - local potential @xmath6 as a sum of a non - local exchange term and a local ks correlation potential@xcite : @xmath7 . for @xmath8 a lda or gga expression",
    "is adopted , while the non - local exchange term @xmath9 is obtained mixing the ks local exchange @xmath10 with a fraction @xmath11 of the non - local fock operator @xmath12 , built using gks orbitals in the one - particle density matrix @xmath13 [ @xmath14 is the coulomb interaction ] : v_x(r , r ) = v_x^f(r , r ) + ( 1-)v_x(r ) .",
    "[ vxnl ] this construction is often justified from considerations based on the adiabatic - connection formula , which fix the mixing parameter to be @xmath15.@xcite the coulomb interaction can be then split into a sum of a long - range and a short - range term @xmath16 , respectively as : v(r , r ) = + . here both the choice of the @xmath17 error function and the parameter @xmath18 are arbitrary . replacing the bare interaction @xmath19 by either term , the same separation is obtained in the local and non - local exchange potentials appearing in : @xmath20 and @xmath21 . assuming that the effects of @xmath22 and @xmath23 compensate each other , the following approximation for is introduced : v_x(r , r ) = v_x^f , sr(r , r ) + ( 1-)v_x^sr(r)+ v_x^lr(r ) .",
    "[ vxnlapprox ] regrouping the various terms contributing to the xc gks potential , one finally finds : v_xc(r , r ) = + v_xc(r ) , [ vxcnl ] where the correction to the ks local potential @xmath4 ( with the original coulomb interaction ) stems entirely from the first term in the r.h.s .",
    "the final approximation depends on the two parameters @xmath11 and @xmath18 . with @xmath24 , @xmath15 , and using the pbe gga xc potential for the local part @xmath4 , one finds the pbe0 approximation.@xcite in the hse06 hybrid functional@xcite , instead , the value of @xmath25 is obtained by numerically fitting the results against a benchmark set of data .",
    "more in general , both the @xmath11 and @xmath18 parameters play the role of effective screening of the coulomb interaction @xcite .",
    "the non - local potential with @xmath24 can be alternatively understood as a static approximation to the many - body gw self - energy@xcite . by identifying @xmath26 as an effective static dielectric constant @xmath27",
    ", @xmath28 can be seen as a screened exchange potential , while the local part of acts as an approximation to the coulomb hole term.@xcite in fact , varying @xmath11 between 0 and 1 in eq .",
    ", one in practice interpolates between the ks underestimation and the hartree - fock ( hf ) overestimation of band gaps , with the possibility to get close to the experimental results .",
    "moreover , the use of a finite value for @xmath18 , together with neglecting the corresponding long - range terms in , efficiently acts as a further screening of the coulomb interaction.@xcite by increasing the value of @xmath18 , the two - point distance @xmath29 beyond which the coulomb interaction is cut off becomes shorter .",
    "in fact , screening the long - range coulomb interaction is crucial for many properties in bulk materials @xcite , especially for small - gap and metallic systems . while for @xmath30 eq",
    ". reduces to the ks local potential @xmath4 , a finite @xmath18 tunes the correction to ks stemming from the difference between non - local fock and local exchange terms in . for fixed @xmath11 ,",
    "increasing @xmath18 gives less weight to this correction .",
    "while lda suffers from a delocalization error , hf instead is affected by an excess of localization@xcite .",
    "hence , the inclusion in the functional of a partial contribution of non - local fock exchange leads to a localization correction with respect to lda .",
    "this affects in particular @xmath2 and @xmath3 states , which are more localised and generally suffer from a self - interaction error more than @xmath31 and @xmath32 states.@xcite even though it is derived from a very different point of view , this effect of localization of @xmath2 and @xmath3 orbitals is shared also by the lda+u approach .",
    "as we will show in the following , curing the delocalization error of lda is the key to get results in better qualitative agreement with experiment . on the other hand , both lda+u ( as well as lda+dmft ) and the hybrid functional depend on parameters ( like the hubbard u and j in the former and @xmath11 and @xmath18 in the latter ) , which limits their predictivity power .",
    "however , in the hybrid functional there is no need of an additional term for correcting the ( unknown ) spurious double counting , while it is case for lda+u or lda+dmft .",
    "moreover , in the hybrid functional all the electrons are treated on equal footing .",
    "modeling efficiently the static screening of the coulomb interaction without introducing adjustable parameters would help to improve greatly the gks scheme .",
    "at the same time , this should keep its computational cost cheaper than the more sophisticated many - body gw approximation , where the dynamical screening is explicitly calculated ( in the random - phase approximation ) . in any case , being a static approximation to the many - body self - energy , the @xmath6 functional in can not account for dynamical correlation effects , which for instance give rise to satellites in the photoemission spectra @xcite , and are instead accounted for , though in different manners , by both the gw approximation and the lda+dmft approach .    in",
    "the following we will use the hybrid functional form , as implemented in the vasp computer code@xcite . for the local @xmath4 part we adopt a lda xc potential . in the case of vo@xmath0 we will discuss the effect of different choices of the two parameters @xmath11 and @xmath18 , while for the rest of the paper we will fix @xmath15 and @xmath25 as in the hse06 functional .",
    "vo@xmath0 undergoes a twofold phase transition at 340 k@xcite .",
    "the mit is accompanied by a lowering of the symmetry of the crystal structure , from rutile to monoclinic , with a doubling of the unit cell and a dimerization of v atoms along the rutile @xmath33 axis .",
    "it has been long debated@xcite which of the two aspects , the electronic or the structural change , is the key to drive the phase transition .    in vo@xmath0",
    "both lda@xcite and standard single - site dmft@xcite are unable to get the insulating band gap , while lda+u @xcite has problems with the metallic phase and gives an ordered magnetic phase for the insulator , contrary to the experiment .",
    "the deficiencies of single - site dmft have been corrected by its extension to cluster dmft@xcite , where the local impurity is taken to be a v dimer instead of a v atom , as in single - site dmft . on the other hand ,",
    "parameter - free gw calculations@xcite have shown that in the insulating phase ks - lda wavefunctions are not a sufficiently good approximation to quasiparticle ( qp ) wavefunctions .",
    "the lda error is due to an excessive delocalization of the ks wavefunctions at the fermi level .",
    "they turn out to be too isotropic , underestimating the effect of the v dimerization along the @xmath33 axis@xcite , and the corresponding bonding - antibonding splitting of the v @xmath34 states .",

    "thus , the addition of non - local exchange to the ks - lda functional leads to an improved qualitative agreement with experiment , i.e. a sizable band gap is obtained , without the need to invoke strong correlation effects . however , the comparison with photoemission spectra depends quantitatively on the choice that one makes for the values of the two parameters @xmath11 and @xmath18 .",

    "@xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ] +   calculated in lda and hse06 and ( b ) comparison with experimental photoemission spectra from ref . @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]    also in these compounds , the hse06 gives insulating densities of states [ see figs . [ figlatio3_1](a ) and [ figytio3_1](a ) for latio@xmath1 and ytio@xmath1 , respectively ] .",
    "this is the result of the splitting off of a ti @xmath49 band from the states crossing the fermi level in lda . in the case of ytio@xmath1 only spin up states contribute to the occupied @xmath49 band .",
    "thus , these results for both compounds seem to be in contrast with the traditional interpretation of the topmost occupied state as an incoherent lower hubbard band @xcite .",
    "in fact , the peak in the experimental spectra @xcite [ see figs . [ figlatio3_1](b ) and [ figytio3_1](b ) ] is matched , at least partially , by this ( coherent ) ti @xmath49 band .",
    "moreover , within the hybrid functional scheme , the opening of the gap with respect to metallic lda dos is due to non - local exchange .",
    "however , contrary to the experiment , in hse06 the band width of these valence ti @xmath49 states is larger in ytio@xmath1 than in latio@xmath1 . at the same time ,",
    "also the band gap is larger in latio@xmath1 ( 1.74 ev ) than in ytio@xmath1 ( 1.41 ev ) , while the experimental optical gap is 0.2 ev for latio@xmath1 @xcite and 0.7 ev for ytio@xmath1@xcite . in both compounds",
    "the band gap is overestimated , while the occupied ti @xmath49 band width is underestimated , also for possible dynamical effects@xcite that are missing here .",
    "while , as in all the other compounds , the hybridization between o @xmath32 states and ti @xmath2 states does not change much between lda and hse06 [ see figs .",
    "[ figlatio3_1](a ) and [ figytio3_1](a ) ] , a larger effect is seen here for the unoccupied la @xmath3 states in latio@xmath1 . in lda",
    "they are located in the middle of the conduction band , while in hse06 they are shifted to the upper end of the band .",
    "the band gap opening between ti @xmath2 states and the upshift of the la @xmath3 states can been obtained in the gga+u approach@xcite only with the simultaneous use of two ( different ) hubbard u values applied to ti @xmath2 and la @xmath3 states . within hybrid functionals",
    "this result emerges naturally as a consequence of the localization of these states ( the non - local exchange corrects the lda delocalization error treating all the electrons on equal footing ) .",
    "both latio@xmath1 and ytio@xmath1 remain insulating also above the corresponding ( nel or curie ) temperatures where they loose their magnetic order",
    ". a spin - unpolarized hse06 calculation would not be able to obtain a gap in this case . in agreement with mott picture @xcite , while the long - range magnetic order is not essential to have an insulator , the electronic spins do matter .",
    "in fact , latio@xmath1 and ytio@xmath1 in the disordered phases are both paramagnetic .",
    "similarly , above the nel temperatures transition - metal monoxides are also paramagnetic insulators . for these compounds",
    "it was recently shown that a calculation , based on the self - interaction - corrected ( sic ) functional and taking explicitly into account the disordered local moments of the paramagnetic phase , was able to correctly describe the insulating phases @xcite .",
    "thus , a similar calculation would be suitable in the ( disordered ) paramagnetic phase also for the present perovskite compounds ( for which a modified sic implementation has been recently used for the magnetically ordered phases @xcite ) .",
    "the hybrid functionals employed in the present work are not explicitly designed to treat electronic correlations .",
    "nevertheless , we have shown that the inclusion of non - local fock exchange is essential to cure the fundamental problem of getting metallic band structures in kohn - sham lda in the insulating phases of several correlated transition - metal oxides , as those that have been discussed here : vo@xmath0 , v@xmath0o@xmath1 , ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , latio@xmath1 , and ytio@xmath1 .",
    "analogous results have been obtained for instance also by rdl _",
    "@xcite in the series of transition - metal monoxides , where hybrid functionals were also used as an improved starting point for one - shot gw calculations @xcite .",
    "thus , a common conclusion emerges from the study of all these correlated transition - metal oxides using hse06 .",
    "with respect to lda , besides providing a finite band gap , they also correct the position of the o @xmath32 states .",
    "this is a clear advantage with respect to other approaches ( lda+u , lda+dmft , etc . )",
    "stemming from treating all the electrons on the same footing .",
    "moreover , another advantage with respect to lda+u is the consistent treatment of insulators and metals and the fact that hybrid functionals do not yield an insulator together with magnetic long - range order , as it is often the case in lda+u .",
    "however , the hse06 parametrization overestimates the band gap in all the compounds considered here . and , in general , the results depend on the choice of the parameters ( as in lda+u and lda+dmft ) used to build the functional",
    "moreover , hybrid functionals miss completely dynamical correlation effects , which are essential for the description of satellites in photoemission spectra @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is evident that they can not be ( and they are not meant to be ) the final answer for the description of spectral properties of correlated transition - metal oxides .",
    "however , also in these compounds , they demonstrate to be very useful for the discussion of the role of non - local exchange , upon which a clean analysis of the effects of ( dynamical ) electronic correlation can be then established .",
