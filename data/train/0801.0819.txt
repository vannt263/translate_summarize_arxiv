    "absorption measurements against pulsars have provided a wealth of information on the structure of the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "they provide one of the best means of obtaining distance estimates to a large number of pulsars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "combining the distances with the pulsar s dispersion measure ( dm ) allows the average electron density along the line of sight to the pulsar to be determined .",
    "this also allows models of the galactic electron density to be computed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the   absorption measurements essentially provide the means by which the electron density model and the atomic neutral gas models of the galaxy are tied together .",
    "comparison of the  emission when the pulsar is `` off '' with the  absorption against the pulsar can provide information on the density and spin temperature of the absorbing  gas ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "absorption measurements against pulsars have been used to search for structure in the neutral atomic gas on very small scales ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these measurements also play an important role in the study of pulsar population statistics , providing the spatial distribution of pulsars throughout the galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is only natural to attempt to extend absorption measurements against pulsars to molecular gas .",
    "since pulsars have steep spectral indices , it is necessary to look for molecules which have transitions at lower frequencies and which have relatively strong line strengths .",
    "this makes the @xmath1 transitions of the hydroxyl radical ( oh ) at 1612 , 1665 , 1667 and 1720mhz ideal for looking for absorption from molecular material against pulsars .",
    "previously , only two pulsars have been found which have measurable oh absorption ,  discovered by @xcite using the arecibo radio telescope and  discovered by @xcite using parkes radio telescope .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite observed numerous bright pulsars , 25 in total . in both cases ,",
    "the oh absorption seen toward the pulsars have unique properties .",
    "the oh absorption against the pulsars have narrower linewidths and deeper absorption ( larger opacities ) than is observed when the pulsar is `` off . ''",
    "this has been attributed to the presence of small scale structure in the molecular material along the lines of sight to the pulsars .",
    "there are a large number of pulsars which have not been observed for oh absorption . in this paper",
    "i present observations of sixteen pulsars ( , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and ) looking for oh absorption .",
    "oh absorption was only detected against .",
    "the oh absorption measurements were made using the national radio astronomy observatory s ( nrao ) 100  m green bank telescope ( gbt ) .",
    "the gbt has an unblocked aperture and a spatial resolution of 7.4 arc - minutes at 1665  mhz .",
    "the 1 to 2 ghz receiver , placed at the focus of the gregorian optics system , was used for the observations .",
    "this receiver has a nominal bandpass of @xmath2  mhz , dual linear polarization and had a system temperature on cold sky of @xmath3 k. the nrao spectral processor , an fft spectrometer , was used to simultaneously observe the 1612 , 1665 , 1667 and 1720 mhz transitions of oh using orthogonal linear polarizations .",
    "the spectral processor integration time was approximately 10 seconds , set to the nearest integer number of pulse periods .",
    "the spectral processor s 32-level sampling provides excellent dynamic range when radio frequency interference ( rfi ) is present .",
    "most observations used 256 spectral channels per linear polarization per oh transition with a bandwidth of 2.5  mhz , producing a spectral resolution of @xmath4kms@xmath5  per channel .",
    "higher resolution observations were performed for , using 256 spectral channels per linear polarization per oh transition with a bandwidth of 0.625  mhz , producing a spectral resolution of @xmath6kms@xmath5  per channel .",
    "the dates and times of the observations are listed in tables  [ table : obs ] and  [ table : obs1718 ] .",
    "table  [ table : obs ] lists the observing dates and times for those pulsars for which oh absorption was not detected .",
    "table  [ table : obs1718 ] lists the dates , times and bandwidths used for the oh absorption observations toward .",
    "the pulsar oh absorption data were reduced using the technique outlined in @xcite .",
    "the data were flagged for instances when rfi was present .",
    "s galactic coordinates are @xmath0 . since  lies in the galactic plane where continuum emission is present , a slice at constant galactic longitude was observed at the longitude of .",
    "the observations went approximately @xmath7 out of the galactic plane .",
    "these observations allow the galactic continuum along with the continuum from a discrete object in front of to be measured .",
    "combined with the pulsar `` off '' spectra , the opacities of the oh lines can then be calculated .",
    "the data were corrected for the opacity difference between the zenith and the low elevation ( 10@xmath8  12@xmath8 ) of the observations .",
    "a zenith opacity of @xmath9 at 1666mhz was used along with an atmospheric temperature of 250k .",
    "the system temperature of @xmath10k found near the zenith was then subtracted from the data .",
    "the remaining brightness temperature was assumed to represent the continuum emission from the galactic synchrotron and free - free emission ( assumed to be a smooth component ) and  regions or snrs along the line of sight toward .",
    "the two prior large searches for oh absorption against pulsars by @xcite selected their targets based on the brightness of the pulsars . this yielded a detection rate of two out of twenty - five ( 8% ) .",
    "this motivated me to look for a better selection criteria for pulsars with oh absorption .",
    "@xcite proposed that the strongest interstellar scattering ( iss ) of pulsar signals was not induced by kolmogorov - like turbulence in the electrons within the ism , but by refraction at the random interface between ionized and non - ionized gas along the line of sight .",
    "particularly , it was predicted that the photo - dissociation regions ( pdrs ) at the edges of molecular clouds should produce the strongest scattering .",
    "@xcite also suggest that a pulsar s time broadening would scale as density to the fourth power , @xmath11 , so that only the most dense pdr along the line of sight will dominate the iss",
    ". this will give the appearance of a single scattering screen toward the pulsar which is consistent with what is observed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "i list prior attempts to observe oh absorption against pulsars in table  [ table : scattering ] . from table  [",
    "table : scattering ] it is seen that the only oh absorption found ( including all possible detections ) are along lines of sight that are highly scattered and which have large amounts of co. the pulsars with non - detections are typically bright pulsars , have relatively weak scattering and little co along their lines of sight . by just looking at bright pulsars ,",
    "the searches for oh absorption have been biased to lines of sight with little molecular material .",
    "if boldyrev & knigl s hypothesis is correct then the oh absorption searches have also been biased since they tend to be toward weakly scattered pulsars .",
    "i thus created a list of the most highly scattered pulsars that had a measurable amount of co along their lines of sight .",
    "i obtained the scattering values from the atnf pulsar catalog @xcite and the co information from @xcite .",
    "i then selected the pulsars that were outside the declination range of arecibo , viewable with the gbt and which could reach a limiting oh opacity of @xmath12 in less than ten hours as my source list .",
    "this list included the pulsars , , , ,  and which were observed in june  october , 2005 .",
    "another approach that i took was to come up with a list of pulsars that had detectable co emission along their lines of sight .",
    "i excluded pulsars in the declination range of arecibo , pulsars with galactic latitudes greater than five degrees , pulsars that would take more than 30 hours to reach @xmath13 and pulsars that had been previously observed for oh absorption .",
    "there were 85 pulsars that met this criteria .",
    "i then observed the oh emission toward these pulsars with the gbt to determine which lines of sight had detectable oh ( these results will be presented in a future paper ; * ? ? ?",
    "oh was detected on the lines of sight toward 34 of the 85 pulsars .",
    "the velocity of the oh emission , along with the dm  derived distance of each pulsar , was used to determine which pulsars could have oh between the sun and the pulsar .",
    "this then led to observations of , , , , , , , ,  and  with the gbt to search for oh absorption against these pulsars .",

    "did not have any detectable oh in the pulsar `` off '' spectra and was thus not observed for a significant amount of time , resulting in its higher opacity limit .",
    "oh absorption was only detected against .",
    "i show the oh absorption spectra against  as well as the pulsar `` off '' oh spectra for the two resolution modes ( 1.75 and 0.44kms@xmath5 ) in figures  [ fig : wide ] and  [ fig : narrow ] .",
    "after initially detecting the oh absorption against  in the lower resolution mode , which allowed a large velocity range to be searched , i switched to the higher resolution mode to resolve the narrow absorption lines that were present .",
    "the results of gaussian fits to the oh absorption lines are presented in table  [ table : datapulsar ] .",
    "as can be seen from the results in table  [ table : datapulsar ] , the initial wide - bandwidth observations , which had a spectral resolution slightly larger than the true linewidths of the spectral lines , are clearly affected by poor spectral resolution .      from the observed opacity of the 1667mhz absorption against",
    ", we can estimate the oh column density , @xmath15 , in the absorbing cloud . using equation  9.12 of @xcite , along with @xmath16 and a linewidth of @xmath17 ,",
    "the oh column density is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the excitation temperature of the line which is typically 5 - 10k @xcite .",
    "the observed linewidth limits the thermal temperature of the oh to be @xmath20k , resulting in the limit that @xmath21@xmath22 . from the typical excitation temperatures ,",
    "the likely column density is of the order @xmath23@xmath22 . for oh column densities between @xmath24@xmath22skm@xmath5 the satellite lines at 1612 and 1720 mhz",
    "are conjugates with the 1720mhz line being in emission and the 1612mhz line being in absorption @xcite . at column densities",
    "@xmath25@xmath22skm@xmath5 the lines remain conjugates but with the 1612mhz line being in emission and the 1720mhz line being in absorption .",
    "both of these cases occur when the region containing the oh is optically thick to infra - red photons .",
    "as can be seen in the pulsar `` off '' spectra in figure  [ fig : narrow ] , the 1612mhz line is in emission at the velocity where absorption is seen against the pulsar .",
    "however , the 1720mhz line is not detected at a @xmath26 limit of @xmath27k .",
    "this is significantly less than the @xmath28k that we would expect if the 1720mhz line exhibited conjugate emission with the 1612mhz line .",
    "this indicates that the oh column density is @xmath29@xmath22 in the oh absorption absorbing cloud toward . using the standard abundance ratio of @xmath30 @xcite , the total hydrogen column density in the absorbing cloud is of the order @xmath31@xmath22 .",
    "the absorption against  was measured by @xcite and is shown in their figure  1d . at the velocity of the oh absorption , the absorption has an opacity @xmath32 and the emission has @xmath33k .",
    "assuming that half of the total emission comes from the same side of the tangent point , we can expect that the line of sight we encounter equal amounts of gas on the near side and the far side of the tangent point .",
    "thus the total emission at any velocity will have half of its contribution from the near side with the other half coming from the far side of the tangent point .",
    "] as the oh cloud results in an estimated column density @xmath34@xmath22 which is consistent with the column density derived from oh .      @xcite determined that the kinematic distance to is @xmath35kpc .",
    "this puts  on the near side of the tangent point for its line of sight .",
    "the galactic bar is on the far side of the tangent point for the  line of sight and can be ignored in the following discussions .",
    "i show the velocity  distance relationship for the  line of sight using the flat rotation curve of @xcite in figure  [ fig : flat ] . in determining the distance of the oh cloud from its velocity ,",
    "a random motion for cold clouds of 7kms@xmath5  has been used @xcite .",
    "this random velocity was used as an error on the distance model as suggested in @xcite .",
    "an upper limit of 1.86kpc is found for the distance to the oh cloud .",
    "the line of sight toward  is in the extended halo of radio continuum emission surrounding  ( see the figure on page 347 of * ? ? ?",
    "comparing the observed velocity range , @xmath36 to @xmath37kms@xmath5 , for the oh absorption against  with the co velocities of @xcite shows that the oh cloud has the same velocity as b and the extended co emission to the north - east of   ( see figure  6 of * ? ? ?",
    "regions in and around  have velocities in the range @xmath38 to @xmath39kms@xmath5@xcite .",
    "it is thus quite possible that the oh cloud is part of the  giant molecular cloud .",
    "if this is the case then we can place the oh cloud at the distance of , @xmath40kpc @xcite , which is consistent with the kinematic distance upper limit .",
    "the observed continuum emission in a `` slice '' at the constant galactic longitude of  ( 351688 ) is shown in figure  [ fig : cont ] .",
    "the total continuum emission toward psr  b1718 - 35 in the gbt beam is @xmath41k .",
    "a two component gaussian fit that can be assumed to approximate the smooth galactic synchrotron and free - free emission contribution to the continuum emission was made .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : cont ] , this approximates the smooth background continuum emission from galactic synchrotron and free - free emission reasonably well .",
    "this fit then sets the smooth galactic component emission at 5.8k and the continuum in front of  as having 3.51k .",
    "the continuum emission in front of the pulsar comes from three different source that are slightly blended ( this is easily seen in figure  [ fig : spitzer ] ) . at a galactic latitude lower than  is",
    "the  region g351.662 + 0.518 @xcite and at a higher galactic latitude is the snr g351.7 + 0.8 @xcite .",
    "fitting an additional three gaussians to this emission results in a brightness temperature of @xmath42k for g351.662 + 0.518 , @xmath43k for snr g351.7 + 0.8 and @xmath44k for the continuum source in front of .",
    "data from the parkes 6 cm survey of the southern galactic plane at 5009mhz @xcite shows that the continuum source in front of  has a flux of @xmath45k for the  line of sight .",
    "this then gives a spectral index of @xmath46 ( using @xmath47 ) which is consistent with the expected  region thermal emission spectral index of @xmath48 .",
    "for the two previous detections of oh absorption against pulsars , the opacity of the absorption has been greater and the linewidths have been narrower against the pulsar than against the continuum background ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "two viable explanations were put forward in @xcite : a ) the absorption comes from oh clouds whose angular size is larger than the observed scattering size of the pulsar but smaller than the angular size of the telescope beam ; or b ) there are extra oh clouds that are seen in absorption against the continuum background with the larger telescope beam that are not seen along the pulsar line of sight . in the former case , if the oh cloud seen in absorption against the pulsar could be spectroscopically isolated in the pulsar off spectrum , then the linewidths in the two spectra should be the same .",
    "the differences in the optical depth of the line could then be used to constrain the size of the cloud . in the later case ,",
    "the oh cloud is expected to be built from smaller `` cloudlets '' @xcite and we would expect the linewidths and the opacities to be different between the pulsar absorption and the continuum background absorption spectra .",
    "of course , both of these scenarios could be operating at the same time .    in figure",
    "[ fig : narrow ] we see that the 1665 and 1667mhz absorption lines at @xmath49kms@xmath5  have a narrow component and a broader component .",
    "gaussian fits for a narrow and broad linewidth components to the 1667mhz background continuum absorption spectrum are presented in table  [ table : datawidenarrow ] .",
    "the broad component gaussian fit is shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig : abscompare ] .",
    "comparing the results in table  [ table : datawidenarrow ] and table  [ table : datapulsar ] , we see that the narrow component has the same velocity and that the linewidths agree at the @xmath14 level for the pulsar and continuum background cases . in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : abscompare ] ,",
    "i show the opacities of the two narrow components and the difference between them .",
    "the opacity of the pulsar `` off '' spectra was determined using an effective continuum strength of 2.1k ( see below ) which makes the opacities equal . as can be seen in figure  [ fig : abscompare ]",
    ", there is no discernible difference between the narrow component in the pulsar `` off '' spectrum and the absorption against the pulsar .",
    "thus , only the size of the oh cloud will play a role in any difference between the opacity observed against the background continuum and against the pulsar .",
    "since we know the opacity of the oh from the absorption against the pencil - thin beam of the pulsar and there is information on the continuum brightness , limits can be determined for the size of the oh absorption cloud .",
    "this is done using @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the measured , baseline subtracted spectrum ( top panel of figure  [ fig : abscompare ] ) and @xmath52 is the size of the oh cloud ( @xmath53 ) relative to the size of the telescope beam ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "@xmath55 is the effective brightness temperature and corresponds to the oh cloud size weighted background brightness temperature averaged over the entire gbt beam .",
    "performing a least - squares , non - linear fit to the observed narrow linewidth component results in @xmath56k . allowing all of the continuum flux to reside behind the oh cloud ,",
    "@xmath57k where 5.8k is from the smooth galactic continuum and 2.9k is from the  region , gives a minimum size of the cloud assuming that the cloud is spherically symmetric . for this case",
    ". using the 7.4 arc - minute fwhm size of the gbt beam , the minimum oh cloud radius is @xmath59 arc - minutes which at a distance of 1.7kpc corresponds to @xmath60pc . if the oh cloud is behind the  region , and assuming that there is little contribution to the galactic continuum between the sun and , @xmath61 and the size of the oh cloud would is @xmath62 arc - minutes , which corresponds to @xmath63pc at a distance of 1.7kpc .",
    "these size scales along with the column densities derived in ",
    "[ sec : column ] translate into densities of order @xmath64 ",
    "100@xmath65 for the oh cloud .",
    "an ellipse with semi - major and semi - minor axes of 3 and 1.8 arc - minutes roughly covers the area of 8  micron emission seen in figure  [ fig : spitzer ] .",
    "if we assume that the oh cloud size is represented by the 8  micron dust cloud size , then @xmath66 .",
    "this is the same number derived above assuming that the oh cloud is behind the region and in front of most of the galactic background continuum emission .",
    "it seems likely that the oh cloud lies behind the  region .    from the fwhm linewidths in table  [ table : datawidenarrow ]",
    ", the narrow linewidth component corresponds to a thermal temperature @xmath20k .",
    "the broad linewidth components corresponds to a thermal temperature of @xmath67k .",
    "since the oh might be expected to be in regions with temperatures in the range 10  100k , there is obviously a very large turbulent component to the linewidths .",
    "the two components fit in very nicely with the molecular cloud ( mc ) ",
    "region interaction scenario .",
    "the narrow linewidth oh could be in the part of the mc that has not yet interacted with the region while the broad linewidth component is in the part of the mc interacting with the  region .",
    "if it is assumed that there is an interaction between the mc and an  region , then we can estimate the amount of energy input into the mc .",
    "this is done by comparing the linewidths of the narrow and broad components . from the above size ( 6 by 2.6 arcminutes or 2.97 by 1.28pc at a distance of 1.7kc ) and column density estimates ( @xmath68@xmath22 ) , there are @xmath69 oh particles in the narrow line component of the cloud .",
    "an oh linewidth of @xmath70kms@xmath5  corresponds to an energy of @xmath71ergs for each oh molecule , using @xmath72 .",
    "this gives a total energy of @xmath73ergs for all the oh molecules in the narrow linewidth component .",
    "an oh linewidth of @xmath74kms@xmath5   corresponds to an energy of @xmath75ergs for each oh molecule in the broad linewidth component of the oh cloud .",
    "the broad line - component has the same characteristics between the 1720 and 1612mhz lines as does the narrow linewidth component .",
    "we can thus limit the column density of the broad line to be @xmath76@xmath22 which results in a total energy of @xmath77ergs for all the oh molecules in the broad linewidth component .",
    "this suggests that a few times @xmath78ergs of energy have been input into the broad linewidth component .",
    "if we assume that the same amount of energy per particle has been added to all molecular species in the broad component of the oh cloud , then a total of a few times @xmath79ergs of energy have been deposited into the cloud .",
    "snr typically involve a release of @xmath80ergs of energy . a cluster of o and b stars that form  regions can also output @xmath80ergs of energy over their lifetimes .",
    "so it is not unreasonable to assume that the broad linewidth component of the oh cloud has interacted with an  region or snr .",
    "is only the third pulsar found to have oh absorption . in all three cases the oh",
    "absorption arises in the interaction of a mc with a snr or an  region .",
    "forty - seven ( 47 ) pulsars have been searched for oh absorption .",
    "this suggests that oh absorption against pulsars is either quite rare , or that the absorption in most mcs is very weak and below the detection capabilities of current telescopes without very deep searches .",
    "that all known cases involve a mc that is in the process of being destroyed by a snr or  region and that the detection rate is only @xmath81% implies that oh absorption against pulsars is a rare occurrence .",
    "the detection rate using pulsar brightness is about @xmath81% .",
    "i found a detection rate of 17% using scintillation strength for the selection criteria .",
    "i also had a detection rate of 0% using detected oh emission that could be between the sun and the pulsar .",
    "since the  oh detection was found in a search of six pulsars based on their strong scattering , and  is the 7th most strongly scattered pulsar , some credence can be given to the hypothesis of @xcite but it by no means provides conclusive proof for their idea that scattering originates in pdrs at the boundaries of  regions and mcs .    in all likelihood , the continuum object along the line of sight toward  is an  region associated with the  complex .",
    "the spectral index of the source is consistent with what is expected for an  region .",
    "the morphology ( see figure  [ fig : spitzer ] ) of cold dust surrounding warm dust is not consistent with the source being a snr .",
    "there is some h@xmath82 emission associated with the continuum source ( see figure  [ fig : spitzer ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , the shassa survey @xcite does not provide velocity information for the h@xmath82 .",
    "although this line of sight was observed as part of the wham survey @xcite , the 1@xmath8 resolution convolves the emission from the  region toward  with other  regions in .",
    "thus it is not known if the h@xmath82 arises at the same velocities as the oh absorption against .",
    "hydrogen radio recombination lines or higher spatial resolution h@xmath82 with velocity information observations should be performed to confirm that the continuum source is an  region .",

    "the oh cloud has a broad linewidth component and a narrow linewidth component .",
    "only the narrow linewidth component is seen in absorption against .",
    "a similar situation of broad and narrow linewidth components with only the narrow component seen in absorption against the pulsar was observed for  @xcite .",
    "this is also the case for  @xcite .",
