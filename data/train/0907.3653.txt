    "during the last five years , graphene ( a single layer of carbon atoms ) has become a very active field of research in nanophysics @xcite .",
    "it is expected that this material will serve as a base for new electronic and opto - electric devices .",
    "one of the most challenging task is to learn how to control the electron behavior using electric fields in this two - dimensional ( 2d ) layer .",
    "this task is made complicated by the so called klein effect according to which dirac electrons in graphene can tunnel through any electric barrier @xcite . as a consequence in",
    "electrically created quantum dots there are no bound states but only quasi - bound states , or so called resonances @xcite which , however , under certain conditions can have a long life time .    an alternative approach to control",
    "the motion of electrons is to use non homogeneous magnetic fields which can be created e.g. through the deposit of nonostructured ferromagnets .",
    "recently it was shown that nonhomogeneous magnetic structures are able to confine dirac electrons in graphene @xcite . however , up to now semi - infinite ( homogeneous in one direction ) structures were considered , what makes the analysis more simple because the problem is reduced into a one - dimensional one .    in this paper",
    "we consider a finite size magnetic structure where the magnetic field is nonzero only in a finite region of space .",
    "namely , we consider a model homogeneous magnetic field that is non - zero in a circle that we call the magnetic dot .",
    "this situation is the inverse of the one considered in ref .",
    "11 where a magnetic anti - dot was considered , as in ref . 9 for the case of normal electrons , where the magnetic field is zero in a circular region and non - zero outside this region .",
    "such a model system can be realized by having a magnetic vortex piercing the graphene layer or by overlaying graphene with type i superconductor with a circular hole placed in the perpendicular magnetic field . in order to reveal the peculiarities of the behavior of dirac electrons in such magnetic dot we compare the result with those for standard electrons with parabolic dispersion law .",
    "we show that it is impossible to confine 2d electrons in a magnetic dot in contrast to semi - infinite magnetic structures neither in the case of graphene nor in the case of the standard electron , and consequently , all landau levels convert themselves into unbound states .",
    "nevertheless , long living quasi - bound states can be present .",
    "we studied them using the local density of states technique applied previously for the investigation of electrically confined electrons @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii the model of a magnetic dot for a standard electron is considered .",
    "the problem is formulated in subsection a , the local density of states technique is presented in subsection b , the results are discussed in subsection c , while in subsection d the complex energy eigenvalues of the problem are described . in the corresponding subsections of section",
    "iii the problem of the dirac electron in a magnetic dot is presented .",
    "our conclusions are given in section iv .",
    "we assume that a homogeneous magnetic field @xmath0 is present in a circular area of radius @xmath1 , while there is no magnetic field outside it , namely , @xmath2 .",
    "the behavior of the electron is described by the stationary schrdinger equation @xmath3 with the hamiltonian @xmath4 because of the cylindric symmetry of the problem we choose the symmetric gauge for the vector potential defining its single azimuthal component as @xmath5 this azimuthal component is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] together with the magnetic field profile .",
    "( blue solid curve ) , and perpendicular magnetic field @xmath6 ( red dashed curve ) as functions of the radial coordinate.,width=188 ]    in order to simplify the notations we use dimensionless variables , based on the magnetic field strength value @xmath7 .",
    "thus , the magnetic field @xmath8 is measured in @xmath7 units , all distances are measured in the unit of magnetic length @xmath9 , energy and potential in @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , and vector potential in @xmath12 units . in the case of electron moving at a gaas / algaas interface ( @xmath13 ) and magnetic field of 1  t the unit of length is @xmath14 nm , and the energy unit is @xmath15 mev .",
    "the schrdinger equation ( [ sse ] ) in cylindric coordinates reads @xmath16 substituting the wave function @xmath17 we arrive at the radial equations    [ srccylrad ] @xmath18    which have to be solved inside the dot ( region @xmath19 ) and outside it ( region @xmath20 ) .",
    "the boundary conditions ( the continuity of the wave function and its radial derivative ) have to be satisfied at the dot border ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the regular solution inside the dot can be expressed via the confluent hypergeometric function ( kummer function @xmath22 ) : @xmath23 while the solution outside it is composed of two bessel functions @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the momentum of the free electron ( measured in @xmath26 units ) , and @xmath27 .",
    "note both functions ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) suit us , as they vanish in the limit @xmath30 .    thus , we have three constants @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33",
    ". they can not be defined from the above mentioned two boundary conditions .",
    "that is why we have to conclude that there are no bound states , and consequently , a magnetic field in a finite region of the 2d plane can not confine the electron .",
    "however , quasi - bound states can be expected when the electron energy in the dot is close to the landau levels with energy @xmath34 ( here @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) defined in the case of homogeneous magnetic field .",
    "confirmation of this statement follows from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where the electron wave functions for two different energies are shown .    ,",
    "@xmath37 : @xmath38  red solid curve , and @xmath39  dashed blue curve .",
    "the magnetic dot region is indicated by shadowed rectangle.,width=207 ]    we see that in the case of @xmath40 ( red solid curve ) which corresponds to the landau level with @xmath41 and @xmath42 the wave function is large in the dot region ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] by shadowed yellow rectangle ) , while for the case of energy @xmath43 , which does not coincide with any landau level energy , it does not have any appreciable large value inside the dot , and actually does not differ much from the wave function for a free electron calculated in cylindric coordinates .",
    "next we will look for possible long living quasi - stationary states in the magnetic dot . in principle",
    "such quasi - bound ( or quasi - stationary ) states have to be described by the solution of the time dependent schrdinger equation which is much more complicated as compared with the standard eigenvalue problem .",
    "there are , however , several alternative approaches which enable us to investigate properties of quasi - bound states by stationary means .",
    "we follow the method presented in detail in ref .  , and calculate the local density of states .",
    "the basic idea is to confine the electron in a large region of finite radius @xmath44 , where its wave function obeys the zero boundary condition at the border ( @xmath45 ) and treat the problem as a stationary one .",
    "a measurement that probes quantum dot properties , say , measuring of the tunnelling current directed perpendicular to the dot with stm , or power absorption in near field infrared spectroscopy , has to depend on the averaged value of the electron wave function in the dot .",
    "therefore we introduce the integral @xmath46 which depends on the electron wave function , and actually is proportional to the so called _ local density of states_. the aperture function @xmath47 characterizes the interaction of the electron with the measuring probe .",
    "this integral is sensitive to the probability to find the electron in the dot , and in the case of a quasi - bound state it will exhibit a peak corresponding to the energy of this state .",
    "the width of the peak is related to the inverse of the life time of this quasi - stationary state .    for the sake of determinacy we use the aperture function of a gaussian : @xmath48 which corresponds to the probability to find the electron in the dot area @xmath49 . in the case of larger @xmath50 value instead of the local density of states we obtain the squared wave function value in the center of the dot , while in the case of smaller @xmath50 value the peculiarities of the dot are washed out .",
    "the solution of the schrdinger equation ( [ srccylrad ] ) given by eqs .",
    "( [ solin ] ) and ( [ solout ] ) has to satisfy the following boundary conditions :    [ bc ] @xmath51    which converts our problem into an eigenvalue problem . here and",
    "further the subscript @xmath52 means the derivative over @xmath53 .    at the end , we are interested in the limiting case @xmath54 . therefore , in the last of eqs .",
    "( [ bc ] ) we replace the bessel functions by their asymptotic , namely , we have @xmath55 instead of eq .",
    "( [ bc3 ] ) .",
    "postponing till later the proper wave function normalization we assume that @xmath56 and @xmath57 and rewrite the above equation as @xmath58 this equation shows that the eigenvalues of the considered problem are approximately separated by @xmath59 , and reduce to a continuum spectrum in the limit @xmath54 . constructing some averaged description which is valid",
    "when calculating the local density of states , we replace eq .",
    "( [ bc3 ] ) by the following one : @xmath60 now solving it together with eqs .",
    "( [ bc1],b ) we obtain three constants : @xmath61 with    [ constpq ] @xmath62    the obtained constants enable us to calculate the integral ( [ lds ] ) .    in order to convert the above integral into the local density of states we have to multiply it by two additional constants .",
    "one of them is the wave function normalization factor @xmath63 , which can be estimated calculating the integral of the squared wave function in the limit of large radius @xmath44 .",
    "the replacement of the bessel functions by their asymptotic immediately leads to @xmath64 .",
    "the second one is a consequence of the replacement of the summation over the discrete eigenvalues by the integration over energy , which is given by the factor @xmath65 .",
    "together they give @xmath66 , which results into definition of the local density of states @xmath67      we solved numerically eqs .",
    "( [ constpq ] ) . inserting the obtained results into ( [ constabc ] ) , and later in eqs .",
    "( [ solin ] ) and ( [ solout ] ) we obtained the wave function what enabled us to calculate the integral ( [ lds ] ) , and finally the local density of states ( [ stlds ] ) .    a typical result for the local density of states as a function of electron energy is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "and @xmath68 shown by the solid red curve .",
    "the same density calculated for a free electron according to eq .",
    "( [ sfrlds ] ) is shown by the blue dashed curve.,width=264 ]    we clearly see peaks close to the energies of the landau levels ( [ ll ] ) calculated for the case of a homogeneous magnetic field . these peaks are broadened indicating that they are not really bound states in the magnetic dot . the broadening is larger for higher energy peaks .",
    "the next thing which also is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is a decreasing background with energy .",
    "this background is due to the states of the free electron in the absence of the magnetic dot . to justify this statement we made the same averaging ( over circle of radius @xmath1 ) with the same gaussian aperture function ( [ gtf ] ) of the radial component of the free electron wave function ( when there is no magnetic dot ) .",
    "this function reads @xmath69 and is valid in the whole 2d plane . inserting this function into integral ( [ lds ] ) and later in eq .",
    "( [ stlds ] ) and using tables of integrals @xcite we obtain the local density of states for a free electron @xmath70 where @xmath71 stands for the modified bessel function of the first kind .",
    "this local density of free electron in the case of @xmath42 is shown in the same fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] by the blue dashed curve . comparing these two curves",
    "we clearly see how increasing the electron energy we reduce the influence of the magnetic dot on the electron behavior , and the local density of states converts itself gradually into the free electron one .",
    "we fitted the peaks in the density of states by lorentzian functions @xmath72 defining three parameters for any of them : the position @xmath73 , its broadening @xmath74 , and the amplitude @xmath75 .",
    "two of them ( the position and broadening ) are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] for different orbital momenta as functions of the radius of the dot @xmath1 .",
    "the position of the quasi - bound states @xmath73 are shown by the red solid curves while the broadening of the peaks is indicated by the shadowed areas limited by the @xmath76 curves .    .",
    "the energies of these states are given by red solid curves and the widths ( i.  e.  the inverse of the life time ) by shadowed regions . the landau levels are indicated by blue dashed lines.,width=302 ]     but now for @xmath77.,width=302 ]    notice that the levels to the right of the green dotted curve are extremely narrow and their position coincides with the landau levels ( [ ll ] ) shown by the blue dashed horizontal lines .",
    "in fact this means that almost all electron wave function is located in the magnetic dot ( using the classical description language we may say that the electron rotates along the larmor circle inside the dot ) and it does not touch the border of the magnetic dot .",
    "when the dot radius @xmath1 becomes smaller the larmor circle touches the dot border and tunnelling of the electron outside the dot starts which broadens the level .",
    "the partial penetration of the wave function outside the dot leads to a lowering of the quasi - bound state energy as well .",
    "the raising of this energy for small @xmath1 values is caused by the large asymmetry of the peak where actually the approximate replacement of the peak by a lorentzian type function is no longer valid .",
    "this picture is more or less the same for all positive @xmath78 values ( compare figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the difference is that for larger @xmath78 values the levels start at higher energies what is in agreement with the expression for landau levels ( [ ll ] ) .",
    "the picture for negative @xmath78 values is different as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] .     and different negative @xmath78 values .",
    "the vertical dotted green lines are the analog of the dotted curve in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] , separating the weakly broadened states from those with small lifetime.,width=302 ]    all of them belong to the same landau level energy which is an expression of the degeneracy of the landau level .",
    "we see that with decreasing radius of the dot @xmath1 the levels with different @xmath78 disappear step by step , the ones with smaller absolute @xmath78 values disappear later .",
    "this is in agreement with the fact that the larger the @xmath79 value the larger the radius of the electron trajectory , and the electron wave function is closer to the dot edge .",
    "the increase of the peak broadening at small @xmath1 values is so steep that it is worth to divide all the peaks into two classes as shown in the above figures by the green dotted curves .",
    "the levels on the left side of these curves belong to essentially broadened quasi - bound states , while those on the right side from the experimental point of view can hardly be distinguished from the real bound states .",
    "one can rudely estimate the position of this dividing curve comparing the approximate dimensions of the electron wave function calculated in the case of a homogeneous magnetic field ( which actually coincides with function ( [ solin ] ) ) with the magnetic dot radius @xmath1 .",
    "a more accurate estimation can be obtained solving the stationary schrdinger equation for complex energy eigenvalues as was described in ref .  .",
    "we draw these dividing curves in figs .",
    "[ fig4]-[fig6 ] using this technique which is sketched in the following section .",
    "according to ref .",
    "the lifetime of the quasi - bound state , or the trapping time of the electron in the quantum dot can be estimated solving the time - independent schrdinger equation and applying boundary conditions of the outgoing waves at the sharp dot border .",
    "in our case this technique reduces to connecting the wave function ( [ solin ] ) defined in the dot with the outgoing electron wave function outside it , which is given by the first kind hankel function @xmath80 with @xmath81 applying the boundary conditions for these wave functions and their derivatives we obtain the following equation : @xmath82 where for the sake of simplicity we omitted the indexes of the hankel functions .",
    "the indexes which are only left indicates the derivative over the coordinate @xmath53 .",
    "this equation has to be solved for a complex energy ( or complex @xmath83 ) , the imaginary part of the energy gives the inverse of the lifetime .    for finding the dotted curves in figs .",
    "[ fig4]-[fig6 ] separating the quasi - bound and nearly bound states it is enough to solve the above equation by means of a perturbation expansion in terms of the momentum difference @xmath84 where @xmath85 with energy @xmath86 of the unperturbed landau level . limiting ourselves to first order in @xmath87 we arrive at the following expression : @xmath88 all functions and their derivatives over @xmath53 and @xmath83 have to be calculated at @xmath21 and @xmath89 .    now introducing the energy deviation from the landau level energy @xmath90 taking its imaginary part and equating it to @xmath91 (",
    "it is expected that a smaller broadening can hardly be revealed experimentally ) we obtained the points connected by the green dotted curve in figs .",
    "[ fig4]-[fig6 ] separating the quasi - bound states from nearly bound states .",
    "now we repeat the above calculation for the magnetic dot applying it to the case of a dirac electron in graphene , where the low - energy quasi - particles ( electrons and holes ) are described by the following dimensionless dirac - like hamiltonian : @xmath92 here , @xmath93 stands for the @xmath94 pauli matrices .",
    "the units are based on the magnetic field strength @xmath7 and they are the same as in previous section , except the unit of energy which now is @xmath95 with the fermi velocity @xmath96 cm s@xmath97 . in the case of a 1 t magnetic field",
    "this energy unit is 2.6 mev .",

    "we require the continuity of the obtained components at the dot border @xmath1 @xmath100 instead of solving these first order differential equations it is more convenient to convert them into second order differential equations for a single component , say for component @xmath50    [ equa2 ] @xmath101\\right\\}b_i = 0 , \\phantom{m}\\\\    \\left\\{\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{d}{dr}r\\frac{d}{dr } + \\left[e^2    - \\frac{(m + 1 + r_0 ^ 2/2)^2}{r^2}\\right]\\right\\}b_{ii } = 0 .",

    "for this reason the boundary conditions ( [ dbc ] ) are equivalent to @xmath102 these boundary conditions are identical to those for the previous schrdinger electron case ( [ bc ] ) .",
    "it enables us to use the full analogy with the previous case .",
    "taking this analogy into account we have for the solution in the two regions    [ solinout ] @xmath103    where @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 .",

    "when the energy is close to the landau level energy of the dirac electron in a homogeneous magnetic field , @xmath112 ( see the lower plot of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] where the energy is close to the landau level with @xmath42 , @xmath41 ) we see a clear accumulation of the wave function components in the dot , what indicates a quasi - bound state .      developing further the analogy of eq .",
    "( [ equa2 ] ) with the considered previously case we calculated the local density of states using eqs .",

    "[ fig8 ] for positive energies .     and @xmath121 shown by red solid curve .",
    "the dashed blue curve is the free electron density of states.,width=264 ]    two differences with respect to standard electrons can clearly be noticed .",
    "first , in the case of the dirac electron the spectrum is symmetric with respect to energy inversion ( @xmath122 ) due to the equivalence of electrons and holes .",
    "thus the plot in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] has to be supplemented by the same curves for negative energies .",
    "second , comparing the density of states for dirac electron with the same curve for the schrdinger one ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) we see that there are more peaks .",
    "this can be explained by the more dense landau level spectrum in the case of dirac electrons ( [ dll ] ) for the large quantum number values as compared with these for the previous case ( [ ll ] ) .    as before we fit the peaks by lorentz type curves what leads to the broadened levels displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] .     for the dirac electron in the magnetic dot .",

    "the landau levels are indicated by blue dashed lines.,width=302 ]     but now for @xmath123.,width=302 ]    we see that the levels with @xmath123 start at lowest energies what is just the consequence of chosen definition of radial wave function components ( [ wfdir ] ) .",
    "the green dotted curves divide the region of broadened quasi - bound states from the region where the states have a very small broadening .",
    "these curves were obtained in the same way as it was done in section [ compentex ] for the case of schrdinger electron , namely , applying the complex energy eigenvalue technique . in the case of the dirac electron it leads to the following imaginary energy part : @xmath124 the above mentioned dotted green line corresponds to @xmath125 .",
    "note we chose it three times smaller than in figs .",
    "[ fig4]-[fig6 ] what causes us to conclude that between the local density of states technique and complex energy eigenvalue method one can expect only qualitative agreement .",
    "there is one more interesting point  the zero energy state which is shown in fig .  [ fig10 ] by thick red line along the @xmath126-axis .",
    "its behavior differs essentially from all other states .",
    "that is why it needs some special attention which is presented in the next subsection .",
    "now we check whether the dirac electron has a zero energy state in the magnetic dot . in this case instead of",
    "( [ twosysrad ] ) we have to solve the following two equations for the radial components of the electron wave function :    [ zerosys ] @xmath127    these are uncoupled differential equations of the first order , and their solution can be found by a straightforward integration .",
    "the solution has the following asymptotic behavior : @xmath128 and @xmath129 or @xmath130 and @xmath131 in order to have the wave function with finite norm two boundary conditions have to be satisfied .",
    "first , the function should behave like @xmath132 ( @xmath133 ) when @xmath134 , and second , it should behave like @xmath135 ( @xmath136 ) when @xmath137 .    for the @xmath138 component",
    "the above conditions reduce to the requirements @xmath139 and @xmath140 , which can not be satisfied simultaneously .",

    "when the radius of the dot decreases this interval becomes smaller , and the zero energy states vanish one by one . finally , at @xmath144",
    "all of them disappear .",
    "such essential difference between the bound zero energy level and all other quasi - bound levels is caused by the fact , that the wave function of the state with zero energy is real .",
    "consequently , the electron in this state has no velocity , and as a result there is no tunnelling of this electron outside the dot .",
    "unfortunately , the absence of any non zero electron velocity makes it impossible to reveal this state in transport measurements , but maybe it can reveal itself through the statistic properties of the magnetic dot .",
    "we considered the eigenvalue problem of a model quantum magnetic dot where the homogeneous magnetic field perpendicular to the 2d electron motion plane is created only in a finite region  in a circle of radius @xmath1 .",
    "we showed that such a magnetic field fails to confine electrons both for the standard parabolic dispersion law or the ultra relativistic linear dispersion law for dirac electrons in graphene .",
    "although in such a magnetic dot no confined states are found , quasi - bound sates with a finite lifetime are present .",
    "an analysis of the quasi - bound states for the schrdinger and dirac electron was performed by means of the local density of states , and the position and width of the resonance peaks ( the analogs of the quasi - stationary states ) , on the dot radius ( or the strength of the magnetic field ) were calculated .",
    "the broadening of these peaks ( the inverse lifetime of the quasi - bound state ) is mainly caused by the touching of the quantum dot border by the electron wave function tail .",
    "due to the exponential character of this tail there exist a rather sharp border between broadened quasi - bound states and those which can be considered as nearly bound ones .",
    "this border was found by applying the complex energy eigenvalue method which is shown to be in qualitative agreement with the results obtained from the local density of states technique .",
    "it is shown that the difference of the quasi - bound states in the magnetic dot between the schrdinger and dirac electrons is only in the energies of these states which is a consequence of the different energies of the corresponding landau levels .",
    "there is a single exception : in the case of dirac electrons there exists a zero energy bound state for negative values of the angular momentum ( the momentum which is opposite to the direction of the classical electron rotation along the larmor circle ) . when the dot radius @xmath1 ( or the magnetic field strength ) decreases the degeneracy of this zero energy level decreases skippingly while all other quasi - bound states disappear smoothly via their broadening .",
