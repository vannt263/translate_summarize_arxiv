    "one basic issue in correlated electron systems concerns how electron - electron interactions lead to non - fermi liquid behavior .",
    "proximity to a quantum critical point ( qcp ) provides one mechanism .",
    "fermi liquid theory for spatial dimensions higher than one is internally consistent when the electron - electron interactions are treated perturbatively . at a qcp ,",
    "however , the effective interactions can become very strong due to quantum critical fluctuations , opening the door to a non - fermi liquid critical state .",
    "quantum critical metals are of general interest in a variety of strongly correlated electron systems , possibly also for high temperature superconductors@xcite .",
    "the issues are however particularly well - defined in heavy fermion metals , for the simple reason that qcps have been explicitly identified . here , the transitions are typically between a paramagnetic metal and an antiferromagnetic metal . for instance , @xmath0 becomes magnetic when the au - doping reaches @xmath1@xcite , the stoichiometric @xmath2 is fortuitously sited ( @xmath3 ) close to its qcp@xcite , and in the cases of @xmath4 and @xmath5 the nel temperature can be suppressed by applying pressure@xcite . in the quantum critical regime , these materials indeed show non - fermi liquid properties .",
    "the electrical resistivity is linear ( or close to being linear ) in @xmath6 , for as extended a temperature range as three decades@xcite .",
    "the specific heat coefficient is either singular  so that the effective mass diverges in the @xmath7 limit  or is finite but contains a non - analytic dependence on temperature .",
    "there is no doubt that such non - fermi liquid behavior originates from quantum critical physics , as fermi liquid properties ( constant specific heat coefficient and/or @xmath8 resistivity ) are recovered at low temperatures when the system is tuned away from the qcp@xcite .",
    "some direct clues to the nature of such metallic qcps have come from the inelastic neutron scattering experiments of schrder _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "the frequency and temperature dependences of the dynamical spin susceptibility are characterized by an anomalous exponent @xmath9 as well as @xmath10 scaling .",
    "in addition , the same anomalous exponent @xmath11 is seen essentially everywhere in the brillouin zone .",
    "these experimental results differ in a very basic fashion from the standard hertz - millis picture , which argues for a gaussian fixed point@xcite .",
    "the gaussian picture is formulated entirely in terms of paramagnons ",
    "the long - wavelength fluctuations of the magnetic order parameter .",
    "the critical theory is the @xmath12 theory , describing the non - linear couplings of the paramagnons .",
    "other degrees of freedom , including fermions , are considered to be bystanders ; the primary effect of fermions is to cause a landau damping , making the dynamic exponent , @xmath13 , larger than 1 . in the antiferromagnetic case , the damping is linear in frequency and @xmath14 .",
    "for either three or two spatial dimensions ( @xmath15 ) the effective dimension , @xmath16 , is larger than or equal to @xmath17 , the upper critical dimension of the @xmath12 theory .",
    "the fixed point is therefore gaussian . as a result",
    ", the dynamical spin susceptibility would have to have the mean - field form , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the antiferromagnetic ordering wavevector .",
    "the search for non - gaussian quantum critical metals has proceeded along a number of directions@xcite .",
    "here , i describe in some detail the work on the local quantum critical point@xcite , which can confront the existing experiments .",
    "we focus on the kondo lattice hamiltonian , @xmath20 a lattice of spin-@xmath21 local moments ( @xmath22 ) and a conduction electron band ( @xmath23 ) are coupled through an antiferromagnetic kondo exchange interaction ( @xmath24 ) and an rkky interaction ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the number of conduction electrons per unit cell , @xmath26 , is taken to be close to but ( without loss of generality ) less than 1 ; all the phases are metallic .",
    "two limits of this model are well - understood@xcite .",
    "when the rkky interaction is negligible , the local moments are expected to be completely screened by the spins of the conduction electrons .",
    "the resulting kondo resonances turn the local moments into a part of the electronic excitations below some energy scale @xmath27 ( fig .",
    "[ lqcp ] ) . in the opposite limit ,",
    "the dominating rkky interactions lead to an antiferromagnetic metal .    to treat the dynamical competition between the rkky and kondo interactions , we have applied an extended dynamical mean field theory ( edmft ) @xcite .",
    "the key quantities are the usual electron self - energy , @xmath28 , and a `` spin self - energy '' , @xmath29 , which enters the dynamical spin susceptibility as follows@xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the spatial fourier transform of @xmath25 .",
    "the key advantage of the approach is that here spin - damping is no longer assumed to be due to a decay into quasiparticle - quasihole pairs .",
    "[ such an assumption is inherent in the paramagnon approach , and is responsible for a linear @xmath32dependence in @xmath33  cf .",
    "( [ chi - rpa ] ) . ]",
    "the approach sets out to also determine whether the fermionic excitations at the qcp retain the heavy - quasiparticle character . within edmft",
    ", the lattice model is studied through a self - consistent impurity model , the bose - fermi kondo model : @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are determined self - consistently@xcite , and @xmath38 describes a fluctuating magnetic field .     is tuned as the bare kondo scale @xmath39 is kept fixed .",

    "we find two types of qcp@xcite .",
    "the more exotic type is the lqcp , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ lqcp ] . here",
    ", the local energy scale , @xmath27 , vanishes at the qcp .",
    "the local kondo physics is itself critical , and this criticality is embedded in the criticality ( _ i.e. _ an infinite spatial correlation length ) associated with the magnetic ordering transition .",
    "corresponding to the vanishing @xmath27 is a divergent local ( @xmath41 , the @xmath42averaged ) susceptibility .",
    "the specific form of the divergence is logarithmic , @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",
    "the spin self - energy is @xmath45 here , @xmath46 is the value of @xmath31 at the ordering wavevector @xmath47 , and the exponent is given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the `` rkky density of states '' , @xmath50 at @xmath51 .",
    "viewed from the effective local kondo model eq .",
    "( [ h - bfk ] ) , the vanishing @xmath27 corresponds to placing this local problem on its critical manifold ( a separatrix in the @xmath52 parameter space ) .",
    "indeed , the lqcp was first found@xcite using an @xmath53 expansion@xcite for eq .",
    "( [ h - bfk ] ) , along with the self - consistency conditions . here",
    "@xmath54 is the exponent that characterizes the spectrum of the fluctuating magnetic field : @xmath55   ~\\sim ~|\\omega|^{\\gamma } ~{\\rm sgn } \\omega$ ] .",
    "the effects of spin - anisotropy ( @xmath56 and ising ) have been treated in a similar fashion@xcite .",
    "more recently , numerical studies have been carried out@xcite for the edmft equations in the anisotropic kondo lattice model , using a quantum monte carlo algorithm originally developed by grempel and rozenberg@xcite .",
    "the numerical results are consistent with the logarithmic form for the singular local susceptibility at the lqcp [ cf .",
    "( [ chi - loc - lqcp ] ) ] .",
    "the numerical value for the exponent @xmath11 is about @xmath57 , close to what is seen experimentally in @xmath0 .",
    "since the peak susceptibility , @xmath58 , is divergent at the qcp , the basic condition for realizing a lqcp is such that the @xmath42averaged susceptibility diverges at the same point where the peak susceptibility does .",
    "two dimensional magnetic fluctuations satisfy this condition",
    ". if the magnetic fluctuations are purely three dimensional , and if there is no frustration , then @xmath27 would be finite at the qcp corresponding to a crossover scale towards the eventual gaussian behavior@xcite .",
    "we also note that our analysis applies provided the @xmath7 transition is continuous .",
    "the latter can be explicitly checked by studying the edmft equations on the ordered side ( in the presence of a self - consistent static field ) ; work along this direction is in progress .",
    "based on ginzburg - landau considerations@xcite , we have also argued that the lqcp is robust beyond the microscopic edmft provided @xmath9 . the key issue is whether the local susceptibility at the qcp remains divergent when we allow for a @xmath42dependence in the self - energies .",
    "writing the general scaling form for the static spin susceptibility for @xmath59 in the vicinity of the ordering wavevector @xmath60 , @xmath61 the question becomes equivalent to whether the spatial anomalous dimension @xmath62 remains equal to zero : if it is , then the corresponding local susceptibility in two dimensions remains singular . for @xmath9 ,",
    "the non - linear couplings among the long - wavelength modes are irrelevant ; their contributions to the spin self - energy will contain a @xmath42dependence that is at most @xmath63 .",
    "this , coupled with the fact that the contributions to the spin self - energy from the local modes are expected to be smooth in @xmath59 , lead to the conclusion that @xmath64 .",
    "the lqcp is therefore internally consistent .",
    "to reiterate , the tuning to the qc regime provides a robust mechanism for a singular local susceptibility , which in turn places the local ( kondo ) fluctuations exactly at its own criticality .",
    "we now turn to experimentally testable properties :    * the dynamical spin susceptibility is @xmath65 * the static uniform spin susceptibility has a modified curie - weiss form , @xmath66 with exactly the same exponent as in eq .",
    "( [ chi - qomegat ] ) . *",
    "the nmr relaxation rate contains a temperature - independent component : @xmath67 * the fermi surface changes sharply at the qcp , from `` large '' [ volume @xmath68 to `` small '' ( volume @xmath26 and a different topology ) as the system orders .",
    "( [ chi - qomegat ] ) reproduces the form observed@xcite in the inelastic neutron scattering experiments on @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , the neutron results are consistent with two - dimensional magnetic fluctuations@xcite .",
    "recently , nmr experiments have been carried out@xcite in @xmath2 .",
    "the relaxation rate @xmath69 is strongly dependent on the magnetic field , in a way that appears consistent with @xmath70 scaling . over the temperature range where the specific heat is logarithmic",
    ", @xmath71 does contain a constant component .",
    "even more recently , nqr experiments have been carried out@xcite at a cu site in @xmath0 .",
    "the relaxation rate has a non - korringa temperature dependence ; at low temperatures @xmath72 , where the exponent @xmath73 is very close to the fractional exponent @xmath11 seen in the @xmath59-dependent dynamical spin susceptibility @xcite .",
    "this result would be consistent with the neutron scattering result if the hyperfine couplings between the cu nuclei and the @xmath74-electron spins at the ce sites are such that the dominant contributions to @xmath69 come from generic wavevectors ( wavevectors far away from the peak wavevectors ) . with this assumption about the hyperfine coupling ,",
    "the cu - site nqr experiment confirms the existence of the fractional exponent over an extended region of the brillouin zone .",
    "in addition to @xmath0 , the modified curie - weiss form for the uniform spin susceptibility , eq .",
    "( [ modified - cw ] ) , has also been seen@xcite in @xmath2 .",
    "the fermi surface reconstruction can be probed through de haas - van alphen experiments .",
    "we are aware of one case , @xmath75 ( the quantum - critical behavior of which is not yet as well characterized as for the other heavy fermions ) , in which such measurements do reveal a fermi - surface reconstruction@xcite .",
    "a less direct experimental signature is that the hall coefficient should jump as the system is tuned through the qcp@xcite ; some preliminary indication for such a behavior has been found@xcite in @xmath2 .",
    "we make two remarks in passing .",
    "first , similar features in the dynamics ( @xmath76scaling)@xcite and other properties@xcite occur in ucu@xmath77pd@xmath78 , raising the possibility that local criticality is also operating in these ( strongly disordered and frustrated ) systems .",
    "second , we have focused on the quantum - critical physics associated with a transition between paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic metals .",
    "other phases , such as spin - liquids@xcite , may also be relevant@xcite .",
    "we have identified a local quantum critical metal , which is described by a non - gaussian fixed point .",
    "this picture provides a natural explanation for some most unusual experiments in heavy fermion metals in the vicinity of a magnetic quantum critical point .",
    "the local quantum critical point serves as a concrete example in which fermions , instead of being bystanders , directly participate in the critical behavior .",
    "the kondo resonances , which have the quantum numbers of an electron and would turn the local moments into a part of the electron fluid , become critical at the same point where a magnetic ordering sets in .",
    "more generally , the local moment physics in kondo systems is analogous to the mott phenomenon .",
    "the strong coulomb interactions lead to a microscopic coulomb - blockade or , equivalently , a projection onto a restricted hilbert space .",
    "such effects are assumed to be inconsequential in the gaussian quantum critical metal picture . on the other hand , and reminiscent of what happens in the usual mott transition , they play a central role in a local quantum critical metal .",
