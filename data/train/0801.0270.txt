    "although the result on the partition number for 2-edge - colored complete bipartite graphs was obtained by kaneko , kano and suzuki in [ 5 ] , and a polynomial - time algorithm to get an optimal partition was obtained by jin et al in [ 4 ] , in the following we will distinguish several cases , and for each of which we will give the exact monochromatic trees to partition the vertex set of a 2-edge - colored complete bipartite graph .",
    "this gives not only the partition number for each case , but more importantly , the clear structural description for the partition , which will plays a key role for obtaining an optimal partition in the 3-edge - colored case .",
    "we first introduce two types of graphs .",
    "let @xmath30 be a 2-edge - colored complete bipartite graph , and all the edges are colored with colors  blue \" or  green \" .",
