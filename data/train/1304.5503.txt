    "we see that the interparticle interaction does not change the mean particle occupation in the middle well in both the twa and the tadpole approximation . but the time the system needs to reach a stationary state increases quadratically with the interaction in the twa . we have also found a qualitative explanation for the behaviour of the steady state current by the use of the spectral properties of the chain of dots . increasing the number of wells from three to four ,",

    "one starts with a rather large trap with a bose - einstein condensate in perfect equilibrium in it .",
    "then by an instantaneous potential shift one induces a sloshing of the condensate .",
    "after that the system shoud be cut into two subsystems , for instance by an impenetrable barrier . in this way one produces two different bosonic reservoirs which contain a large number of particles in excited states . gradually removing the barrier one can then couple these `` reservoirs '' and hence allow for the transport .",
    "the additional structuring of the contact area into several quantum dots can be accomplished in the way similar to that described in @xcite for one well , or by adding a lattice potential along the channel created in @xcite .",
    "we hence expect that such a ` bosonic fet ' can be manufactured with the state - of - the - art experimental methods .",

    "while an extension of the twa appears to be highly non - trivial , the inclusion of the higher order self - energies is , in principle , rather straightforward .",
