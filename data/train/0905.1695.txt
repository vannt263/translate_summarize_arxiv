    "in previous papers @xcite , we reported on the spectra of four comets observed by the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( _ fuse _ ) . launched in june 1999 , _ fuse _  operated through october  2007 providing an orbiting capability with a spectral resolution better than 0.4   in the wavelength range 9051187    together with very high sensitivity to weak emissions making possible both the search for minor coma species and extensive temperature and density diagnostics for the dominant species . our initial reports on the three comets observed in 2001 focused on three hopfield - birge band systems of co not previously observed in comets , the @xmath6 @xmath1(0,0 ) band at 1150.5  , the @xmath0 @xmath1(0,0 ) band at 1087.9   , and the weak @xmath7 @xmath1(0,0 ) band at 1076.1   , three lines of h@xmath8 fluorescently pumped by solar lyman-@xmath9 radiation , and upper limits to emission from and .",
    "the rotational envelopes of the co bands are resolved and appear to consist of both cold and warm components , the cold component , with a rotational temperature in the range 5575  k , accounting for over 75% of the flux and presumably due to native co released by the nucleus .",
    "the warm ( @xmath2500  k ) component suggested a  photodissociation source but this was considered unlikely because the low rate for this process in the solar radiation field would have required a very high relative abundance of .",
    "emission at 1031.9 and 1037.6    was searched for but only the 1031.9    line was marginally detected in c/2000 wm1 at about the level predicted by a model used to explain the x - ray emission from comets as being produced by charge exchange between solar wind ions and cometary neutrals @xcite .",
    "the higher signal / noise ratio in the spectrum of comet c/2001 q4 , observed in april 2004 , enabled an accurate determination of the wavelength of this feature which suggested that it was the  ( 1,1 )  q(3 ) werner ( @xmath10 ) line , which can be fluorescently pumped by either solar  @xmath4989.8 or  @xmath41031.9 .",
    "the latter requires the  to be in the first vibrationally excited state @xcite .",
    "the q(3 ) lines of the ( 1,3 ) band at 1119.1    and the ( 1,4 ) band at 1163.8    are also detected as would be expected for fluorescent excitation .",
    "however , the ground state  abundance in the coma , estimated from the solar lyman-@xmath9 pumped fluorescence of the lyman ( @xmath11 ) ( 6,1 ) p1 line , is insufficient for excitation by solar ( a factor of 10 weaker than ) , which implies the formation of  in the @xmath12 state and excitation by solar .    the molecular channel of the photodissociation of formaldehyde ( i.e. , the channel leading to  and co products ) has been well studied both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "its products are characterized by a non - thermal rotationally `` hot '' co molecule and a vibrationally excited  molecule @xcite .",
    "the co rotational distribution can be represented by a gaussian centered near @xmath13 with a half - width at half maximum in @xmath3 of about 20 .",
    "fluorescence from such levels in the p - branch ( the r - branch is shortward of the detector wavelength cut - off ) is clearly seen in two of the comets observed by _ fuse _  and we propose that this feature , together with the vibrationally excited , constitute an unambiguous signature of  in a cometary coma .",
    "formaldehyde has been observed in these comets in both the infrared and millimeter spectral regions @xcite .",
    "the capability of _ fuse _  to identify  in a cometary coma provides a new means to determine its production rate relative to that of water and to compare these results with ground - based observations in the infrared and millimeter regions of the spectrum .    since the thermal `` hot '' component of the observed co emission is not produced by  dissociation , we return to  as a possible parent , particularly as the rotational temperature is what would be expected based solely on angular momentum conservation arguments @xcite .",
    "we suggest that within the _ fuse _  field - of - view , photoelectron impact dissociation of  has a comparable rate to photodissociation and we base this conclusion on estimates of the mean photoelectron flux derived from the other prominent co band observed in these spectra , the @xmath14  ( 0,0 ) band at 1151   .",
    "we thus have unique diagnostics in which the shapes of these molecular bands can be used to infer the column abundance of co from both its native source as well as from two of its direct molecular parents , together with the photoelectron contributions to excitation and dissociation in the inner coma .",
    "three long period comets were observed during 2001 , c/1999 t1 ( mcnaught - hartley ) , c/2001 a2 ( linear ) , and c/2000 wm1 ( linear ) , with c/2001 a2 being the most active of the three and showing the brightest far - ultraviolet emissions . in december 2001 , two of the reaction wheels on the spacecraft failed resulting in a shutdown of observatory operations until a new pointing control program could be devised and implemented a few months later .",
    "however , no moving target observations were attempted until early in 2004 when comet c/2001 q4 ( neat ) was observed .",
    "the observation parameters for all four comets are summarized in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "observations of each comet were made over contiguous spacecraft orbits during which the center of the @xmath15 spectrograph aperture was placed at the ephemeris position of the comet and tracked at the predicted sky rate .",
    "due to the extended , though not uniform , nature of the cometary emissions within the aperture , the effective spectral resolution is @xmath20.25   .",
    "for each comet , all of the orbits of data were co - added and the extracted fluxes were converted to average brightness ( in rayleighs ) in the @xmath15 aperture .",
    "in addition , the data were separately co - added for only the time during which the spacecraft was in earth shadow",
    ". these `` night - only '' spectra make it possible to differentiate cometary emissions of , , , and , in second order , , from the same emissions produced in the daytime terrestrial atmosphere @xcite . for the co and  emissions",
    "this is not a problem and the entire data set for each comet was used .",
    "all of the data were reprocessed using the final version of the _ fuse _  pipeline , _ calfuse 3.2 _ @xcite . among the enhancements incorporated in this version",
    "were temperature - dependent wavelength corrections , time - dependent corrections to the detector effective areas , and a more complete evaluation of detector background .",
    "the latter was particularly significant in allowing reliable extractions of the fluxes of weak emission features .",
    "the overall absolute flux calibration , based on standard stars and adjusted for the date of observation , is better than 5% .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] also lists the extracted brightnesses of the co emission features discussed below .",
    "the co @xmath16 ( 0,0 ) band , from the total exposure , is shown for each comet in figure  [ cx1 ] .",
    "the p and r branches appear well separated , characteristic of a rotational temperature of 5575  k. there also appear broad wings to the band indicative of a rotational temperature in the range of 500 to 600 k. the figures also show a model fit , assuming solar resonance fluorescence , obtained using the procedure described by @xcite .",
    "the derived column densities and rotational temperatures are given in table  [ tabn ] .",
    "in the two most active comets , c/2001 a2 and c/2001 q4 , there is also an additional broad feature centered at @xmath21089.4   , that we identify as p - branch lines from high - lying @xmath3 states .",
    "the position of the p(40 ) line , calculated using the rotational constants of @xcite , is also shown in fig .  [ cx1 ] .",
    "we note that the @xcite wavelengths have been verified experimentally only up to @xmath17 . the corresponding high @xmath3 r - lines are off the short wavelength edge of the lif2a detector .",
    "a `` hot '' thermal rotational distribution arises in molecular photodissociation in order to conserve angular momentum when the product molecule has a much smaller moment - of - inertia than the parent molecule as is the case for  @xcite .",
    "the non - thermal component is identified with co as a dissociation product of , and the column abundance of this component , also given in table  [ tabn ] , is derived assuming an equal contribution from the unobserved r - branch . in this case ,",
    "an optically thin band fluorescence efficiency is used as the co population is spread over many rotational levels and the absorption is not likely to be optically thick .      as noted above ,",
    "the photodissociation of formaldehyde has been intensively studied , both experimentally and theoretically . the lowest dissociation threshold ( @xmath23600   ) leads to  + co ( the `` molecular '' channel ) while @xmath22700 @xmath18 higher ( @xmath23300   ) , h + hco ( the `` radical '' channel )",
    "can also be produced @xcite .",
    "the nature of the  and co products differs markedly above and below this second energy threshold .",
    "consider first the region below the radical channel threshold .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have used laser - induced fluorescence spectroscopy and coherent anti - stokes raman scattering to experimentally study the product state populations of co and .",
    "@xcite found a nonthermal highly excited co rotational population with a gaussian distribution centered at @xmath19 and a half - width at half maximum of 20 @xmath3 units , but with little vibrational excitation .",
    "later work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) showed that the shape was dependent on the energy of the absorbed photon .",
    "it should be noted that the absorption of  in this region is in discrete bands @xcite . for",
    ", @xcite found that the primary products are the ortho ( @xmath20 and 5 ) states of @xmath12 .",
    "for photolysis at 3390    they found the fractional population of the @xmath12 , @xmath20 level to be 11% .",
    "@xcite extended this work to additional wavelengths and found a peak  population in @xmath21 .",
    "above the radical channel threshold ,  and co are found to have markedly different populations with the non - translational energy going principally to vibrational excitation of  while the co rotational state population shifts to lower @xmath3 states @xcite .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the population of vibrationally excited , up to @xmath22 or 9 , increased as the energy of the exciting photon increased with a corresponding increase in the low-@xmath3 state population of co such that the non - translational energy was conserved .",
    "however , the peak at @xmath19 remained and the low-@xmath3 population was still highly non - thermal .",
    "@xcite showed that the excited vibrational levels of  also had peak rotational populations at @xmath23  or 7 , depending on the photolysis energy .    in the solar radiation field in the coma of a comet",
    ", the  and co state populations derived from  dissociation will reflect a superposition of populations , weighted by the solar flux and absorption cross section @xcite .",
    "such a calculation is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "the broad , weak feature seen longward of the @xmath16 ( 0,0 ) band in comets c/2001  a2 and c/2001  q4 in fig .  [ cx1 ] is centered near the position of the p(40 ) line of this band , and the non - thermal high-@xmath3 population of this feature is an unambiguous fingerprint of co produced from  photodissociation . although the spectrum of c/2000  wm1 is significantly noisier , the data also suggest enhanced emission on the red wing of the band in this comet .",
    "further evidence for this source is the simultaneous detection of fluorescence from vibrationally excited  in this comet @xcite as well as in comets c/2001  a2 and c/2001  q4 .      in figure  [ h2 ] the region of the doublet in comet",
    "c/2001  q4 is shown , and the  ( 1,1 )  q(3 ) line is identified , separated by 0.06   from the position of the line at 1031.92   . the uncertainty in the _ fuse _  wavelength scale is @xmath20.01   .",
    "the same figure also shows the corresponding ( 1,3 )  q(3 ) and ( 1,4 )  q(3 ) lines at 1119.09 and 1163.79   , respectively @xcite .",
    "note that there is no emission at the expected position of the line at 1037.62   .",
    "these lines are quite weak and with the exception of a 3-@xmath24 detection in comet c/2000 wm1 @xcite do not appear in the spectra of the two other comets observed by _",
    "the absence of these lines in the other two comets is the result of the heliocentric doppler shift of the exciting solar line , the swings effect @xcite , rather than the lack of  in the coma .",
    "this can be illustrated with the solar  @xmath41031.9 line profile .",
    "@xcite have used the recent solar spectra taken by the sumer instrument on _ soho _ with an instrumental resolution of @xmath20.1   , to determine the width of this line under quiet sun conditions to be 0.202   .",
    "this result is from an observation of a small part of the solar disk near the center , while for the calculation of cometary excitation rates the whole disk flux is more useful .",
    "fortuitously , we are able to take advantage of a minor operational problem of _ fuse _",
    "@xcite , a sensitivity at certain orientations on the sky of the silicon carbide ( sic ) channels to scattered solar radiation , to determine the whole disk line shape .",
    "the observation of comet c/2001  q4 resulted in such an orientation and the sic1b and sic1a channels ( 905992 and 10051090   , respectively ) measured a large scattered solar flux in all three apertures . both the high ( hirs , @xmath25 ) and medium resolution ( mdrs , @xmath26 ) apertures obtained good s / n spectra of the lines at instrumental resolutions of 0.035 and 0.075   , respectively . from both of these channels we derived a width of 0.200    for the solar  @xmath41031.9 line , in excellent agreement with the result of @xcite .",
    "the mdrs profile is shown in figure  [ solar ] , together with the doppler shifted positions of the  ( 1,1 )  q(3 ) line for each comet .",
    "note that the profile shown in the figure suggests that the solar line is not adequately represented by a single gaussian . clearly , the detection of the ( 1,@xmath27 ) lines in comet c/2001",
    "q4 was favored by its negative heliocentric velocity and by the relatively high activity level of this comet at the time of observation .",
    "@xcite noted that solar lyman-@xmath5 ( 1216.57  ) could pump vibrationally excited  in the @xmath28 level via the lyman band ( 1,2 )  p(5 ) and r(6 ) lines , and used this mechanism to identify fluorescence from the upper level in _ hubble space telescope _ spectra of jupiter following the impact of comet shoemaker - levy 9 in july 1994 .",
    "the same mechanism has recently been found to operate in planetary nebulae where the _ fuse _  spectra show the ( 1,1 )  p(5 ) and r(6 ) lines at 1161.82 and 1161.95  , respectively @xcite .",
    "one of the previously unidentified lines reported in _ fuse _",
    "spectra of comets at 1161.83    was identified by @xcite as a blend of these two  lines ( see fig .  [ h2 ] ) .",
    "the vibrationally excited  would most likely come from  rather than  photodissocation as proposed by @xcite this feature has roughly the same brightness in comets c/2001  a2 and c/2001  q4 , and we note that the brightnesses of the co  p(40 ) feature in these two comets are also comparable . from the branching ratios given by @xcite , we would also expect to see the ( 1,1 )  r(3 ) line at 1148.70    and the ( 1,1 )  p(8 ) line at 1183.31    from the same excited @xmath3  levels , and indeed we do .",
    "the latter is considerably weaker than the former due to the lower population of the even-@xmath3 ( para ) states as expected .",
    "@xcite also identified several other cometary lines as being pumped by solar lyman-@xmath5 from higher vibrational and rotational levels of .",
    "almost all of the strong unidentified features tabulated by @xcite are amongst them .",
    "our analysis supports the conclusion of @xcite that the vast majority of emission features in the _ fuse _  spectra of comets can be attributed to .",
    "however , unlike @xcite , who proposed that the excited vibrational and rotational levels of  arise from the photodissociation of , we suggest instead that these excited  states are produced during the photodissociation of  because their presence in the cometary coma is consistent with the  level populations measured during  photodissociation in the laboratory by @xcite and @xcite .      the co @xmath29  ( 0,0 ) band at 1151    is weaker than the @xmath16  ( 0,0 ) band by a factor of 3 to 4 and thus recorded with poorer signal / noise in all four comets as shown in figure  [ bx1 ] .",
    "it is surprising that this band is observed at all since its fluorescence efficiency is 44 times lower than that of the @xmath16  ( 0,0 ) band ( the predicted spectra using the co column densities given in table  [ tabn ] are also shown in the figure ) .",
    "there must be an additional source of excitation , and since the band shape is consistent with the low temperature co component , that can only be electron impact excitation of co. photoelectrons in the inner comae of comets have been considered by several authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and were detected in the _ vega _ fly - by of 1p / halley @xcite , but their role in excitation , dissociation and ionization is difficult to quantify .",
    "an equivalent to the fluorescence efficiency , or g - factor , may be defined by an electron excitation rate per molecule per second , @xmath30 :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the photoelectron flux in electrons  s@xmath33@xmath34sr@xmath33ev@xmath33 and @xmath35 is the cross section in @xmath36 . in general , the photoelectron flux is a function of cometocentric distance and is anisotropic so that @xmath30 will vary over the spectrograph field - of - view .    rather than attempt to use modeled photoelectron fluxes ,",
    "we instead use the observed co @xmath29  ( 0,0 ) band brightnesses to derive an effective @xmath30 over the _ fuse _  aperture but then use the modeled electron energy distribution to determine the relative excitation rates for other processes . in particular , we are interested in the electron impact dissociation rate of .",
    "relevant cross sections in analytic form for electron impact on co and  are available from the compilation of @xcite .",
    "figure  [ cross ] shows the cross sections for electron impact excitation on co of the two bands under discussion and that for electron impact dissociation of  into the metastable @xmath37  state of co. a typical photoelectron energy dependence , from @xcite , is also shown .",
    "the @xmath37state is the upper level of the co cameron bands , whose excitation in comets has been discussed by @xcite . the total dissociation cross section has been studied by @xcite .",
    "these authors note that the branching ratio into the @xmath37  state of co is 27% of the total electron dissociation rate , the same as for solar photodissociation @xcite .",
    "the derived values of @xmath30 , reduced to 1 au , are given in table  [ tabg ] . for comparison ,",
    "the optically thin solar fluorescence efficiencies are also given .",
    "figure  [ cross ] shows that the steep increase of photoelectron flux towards lower energies favors the @xmath29 transitions over the @xmath16 .",
    "even so , the electron impact contribution to @xmath38 state excitation will reduce the derived co column abundances by 515% and this is reflected in the values given in table  [ tabn ] .",
    "these numbers remain uncertain as both the photoelectron energy distribution and flux will vary with increasing column density towards the nucleus",
    ". this will also affect the ratio of total  dissociation to that fraction leading to the @xmath37  state of co. the @xmath30 values for these processes , for the photoelectron model adopted , are also given in table  [ tabg ] .",
    "for comparison with photodissociation at 1  au , the solar maximum value given by @xcite is @xmath39  molecule@xmath33  s@xmath33 , so electron impact dissociation and photodissociation are comparable .",
    "evidence for a significant role of photoelectrons in the inner coma has often been noted in the literature .",
    "two particular cases in which photodissociation and photoionization were inadequate to account for the abundance of daughter products are the production of atomic carbon in the metastable @xmath40d  state from co @xcite and the high concentration of  close to the nucleus seen in early _ iue _  spectra @xcite .",
    "the _ fuse _  spectra provide additional evidence in the strong  @xmath40d  ",

    "[ bx1 ] , which also can not be accounted for by solar resonance scattering alone . the lower state of this transition , the metastable  @xmath40d  state , is an abundant product of photodissociation of , oh , and co , and is the upper level of the oxygen `` red '' lines at 6300  and  6364   , seen in many comets and often used as a surrogate for the water production rate @xcite .",
    "the column density of the non - thermal component of co was modeled assuming an  parent using the vectorial model of @xcite with solar photodestruction rates given by @xcite .",
    "@xcite have also evaluated the photodissociation lifetimes (  has two other dissociation channels , h + hco , and h + h + co ) and find the rate into  + co to be 25% lower than that of @xcite while the total rate is 7% lower .",

    "even if a distributed source were present ( see section  [ dist ] below ) , the size of the _ fuse _  aperture translates to a few thousand km projected on the sky and such a source can be ignored for our purposes .    to determine production rates relative to water",
    ", we use values of @xmath42 taken from the recent literature ; values derived from soho / swan measurements of cometary lyman-@xmath5 emission by @xcite , and those derived from odin submillimeter observations of  directly by @xcite .",
    "where they overlap , these two sets of values are in agreement to @xmath22025% .",
    "we adopt the values from @xcite because of their finer sampling grid , allowing us to use data from the same day as the _ fuse _  observations .",
    "we use the deconvolved model results from @xcite rather than the daily averages given . for c/2001",
    "q4 we use a value derived from near - simultaneous _ hst _  observations of oh emission , which is close to that reported by @xcite    for c/2001 a2 we note a significant difference from the value of @xmath42 cited in the initial reports of the _ fuse _  observations by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the earlier estimate was based on a visual outburst two days prior to the observation and a modeled production rate adjusted to match the derived  column density .",
    "the latter was based on fluorescence efficiencies derived by @xcite .",
    "with the availability of detailed solar lyman-@xmath9 fluxes and line shapes from soho / sumer @xcite , the heliocentric velocity dependent g - factors were recalculated and the  column density revised downward by a factor of about three , which is consistent with the water production rate for the date given by @xcite    the results are given in table  [ tabq ] .",
    "for the comets in which the non - thermal co is detected , the production rates of  relative to that for  are generally in the range of values found from infrared and millimeter observations .",
    "@xcite reported on four comets observed at millimeter wavelengths including the three comets observed by _ fuse _  at comparable epochs in 2001 .",
    "for comets c/2001  a2 and c/2000  wm1 , our relative production rates are comparable to those of @xcite based on their model that assumes a distributed source with an effective parent lifetime about a factor of 2 longer than the true photochemical lifetime . with an assumed  parent , @xcite derive relative production rates @xmath43 times smaller .",
    "millimeter observations of comet c/2001  q4 were made in mid - may  2004 by @xcite .",
    "their results for , again assuming a distributed grain source , are in close agreement with the _ fuse _  value . while infrared bands of  near @xmath44 m have been detected in a number of recent comets , the only data available for comparison with the _ fuse _",
    "observations is of c/2001  a2 @xcite .",
    "@xcite , observing 2 and 3 days prior to the _ fuse _  observation , found a low value of 0.24% for the ratio of the production rate of  relative to  on july  9.5 followed by a decrease of a factor of 4 one day later .",
    "in contrast , we derive a much higher value for this ratio on july  12.5 . the apparent variability of  is discussed below in section  [ caveat ] .    modeling the  brightness is not as straightforward .",
    "the molecules initially carry away most of the excess energy of dissociation as translational energy ( @xmath211 km  s@xmath33 ) , but they are rapidly thermalized in the inner coma @xcite .",
    "the excited state populations will also vary with incident wavelength and be altered by collisions , so the actual number of  molecules in the @xmath45 level produced by solar photodissociation will have a large uncertainty .",
    "nevertheless , as a consistency check we can evaluate the number of such molecules in the field - of - view needed to produce the observed 0.13 rayleigh brightness of the ( 1,1 ) q(3 ) line at 1031.86   observed in comet c/2001",
    "the fluorescence efficiency , or g - factor , at the peak of the solar line is calculated using the solar minimum irradiance recommended by @xcite and the oscillator strengths and branching ratios taken from the compilation of @xcite .",
    "the derived g - factor is @xmath46 s@xmath33  molecule@xmath33 at 1 au , so that a mean column density of @xmath47 @xmath34 is sufficient to produce the observed emission rate . from table",

    "may also be examined with the identification of solar lyman-@xmath5 pumping of lines in the lyman ( 1,2 ) band as described in section  [ vib ] .",
    "the solar lyman-@xmath5 spectral flux is roughly two orders of magnitude larger than that of  @xmath41031.9 resulting in comparably larger fluorescence efficiencies for these lines .",
    "using solar minimum lyman-@xmath5 fluxes from @xcite and molecular data for the lyman bands from @xcite , the g - factors for the ( 1,1 )  p(5 ) and r(6 ) lines can be calculated .",
    "the relative population of the @xmath50 , @xmath23 , needed to account for the observed 1161.8    emission of 0.24 rayleighs is 2% .",
    "this is consistent with the relative population of this level seen in the laboratory experiments @xcite , when we consider that these experiments are done at discrete wavelengths while in the cometary context photodissociation is produced by the wavelength integrated solar flux .",
    "we conclude that photodissociation of  is sufficient to produce vibrationally excited  that accounts for the presence of lyman-@xmath5 excited fluorescence of  in the coma .",
    "while the production rate of  is @xmath20.5% relative to , the solar photodissociation rate into  is @xmath2100 times higher for , depending on the solar activity level @xcite .",
    "thus both molecules contribute comparable amounts of  to the coma .",
    "the branching of water photodissociation into  + o(@xmath40d ) has also been studied in the laboratory @xcite , but there are no available measurements of the resultant  level populations .",
    "although there has been extensive theoretical work on the h + oh channel of  photodissociation @xcite , there does not seem any devoted to the  + o(@xmath40d ) channel , which is clearly warranted .",
    "on the basis of the brightness of the lyman-@xmath9 pumped fluorescent lines , @xcite suggested that solar photodissociation of water led to a thermal population of  molecules in the @xmath51 , @xmath52 level .",
    "we noted above the utility of the soho / swan data of @xcite to obtain daily values of the water production rate .",
    "for c/2001  a2 near the time of the _ fuse _  observations , the comet exhibited several visual outbursts , particularly one on 2001  july  11.5 , one day before the _ fuse _",
    "observations , which saw a 1.5  magnitude increase in visual brightness @xcite .",
    "these outbursts were reflected in sudden increases in @xmath42 of factors of 23 in one day in the data of @xcite . the _ fuse _  observations of this comet spanned 7.5 hours during which the co emission decreased by a factor of two ( fig .",

    "note that for this comet the _ fuse _",
    "@xmath15 aperture projects to @xmath53  km on the sky so that a molecule moving radially outward at 1  km  s@xmath33  would exit the field - of - view in less than one hour .",
    "hence the observed variation represents variability of the co source on this time scale . on the other hand ,",
    "the column densities given in table  [ tabn ] are taken from the summed spectra ( to improve the signal / noise ratio ) and thus represent average values .",
    "caution is therefore urged in deriving relative production rates from diverse observations , even if obtained on the same date , and in the comparison of results from different observers .",
    "the july  11.5 outburst makes it difficult to compare the derived  production rates of @xcite on july  9.5 and 10.5 , noted above , with the present results . from the limited data available ,",
    "it is not possible to determine whether  production was enhanced by the outburst or whether the increase inferred from the _ fuse _  spectra is just the result of intrinsic variability responsible for the change seen by @xcite a few days earlier .",
    "the same holds for a comparison of our results with the co production rate derived from the same infrared spectrum on july  10.5 @xcite even though in this case the values of @xmath54 are comparable .",
    "a similar caveat applies to comet c/2001  q4 which _ fuse _  observed over a 27  h period .",
    "the variation of the co emission is shown in fig .",
    "[ q4_temporal ] and can be fit with a sinusoidal curve of period 17.0  h and 22% amplitude . yet",
    "the co production rate , derived from _ hst_/stis observations of the co fourth positive system @xcite , made near a minimum in the _ fuse _  lightcurve , is consistent with the mean value derived from the _ fuse _  spectra .",
    "in contrast , comet c/2001  wm1 showed little variation in co emission over a 60  h period . for this comet ,",
    "hst_/stis observations were also obtained and @xcite derived comparable co production rates from both sets of spectra .",
    "as noted in section  [ electron ] , for molecules with long lifetimes against solar photodissociation such as , electron impact dissociation becomes an important destruction channel . using the electron impact rates given in table  [ tabg ] , however , would still require an abnormally large ( @xmath55% ) abundance of  to account for the derived `` hot '' co column density .",
    "since there are no other suitable parents for co other than  and , it is likely that the model used to calculate the values given in table  [ tabg ] significantly underestimates the electron impact contribution to  dissociation .",
    "@xcite note that the threshold for this process is at 7.4  ev whereas the channel leading to the @xmath37  state of co requires 11.4  ev . at low electron energies , the model of @xcite",
    "does not match the data of @xcite , which appears to follow an @xmath56 distribution , so that there may be an additional large contribution to the dissociation rate from low energy electrons .",
    "there are also uncertainties in the radial and angular distribution of the electrons that make our estimate quantitatively unreliable .",
    "a more complete analysis of cometary photoelectrons , which is beyond the scope of the present paper , would entail an analysis of co cameron band emission similar to that presented by @xcite .",
    "fortunately , relevant _",
    "hst_/stis spectra do exist for comet c/2001  q4 and will be treated in a separate publication .",
    "the first evidence for a distributed source of co in the coma of a comet came from the _ in situ _ neutral mass spectrometer experiment on the _ giotto _ mission to comet 1p / halley @xcite .",
    "@xcite also showed , from the same data set , that the  also appeared to come from an extended source and that the  was sufficient to account for the extended co @xcite .",
    "polyoxymethylene ( pom ) , evaporated from organic material on refractory grains , has been postulated as the source of this  @xcite . in recent years ,",
    "as high resolution spectroscopic instrumentation in the near infrared has made the observation of co in comets almost routine , considerable effort has been expended in trying to determine if such distributed sources are common or unique to certain comets @xcite .",
    "identification of a distributed emission source is based on long - slit spectroscopy in which the spatial profile of the emission deviates from that expected for radial outflow @xcite .",
    "for co this can be done in both the infrared and the ultraviolet .",
    "this approach is applicable only to the brightest comets because the spatial pixels along the slit must be small enough to provide adequate spatial resolution . for such comets , such as c/1995 o1 ( hale - bopp ) ,",
    "the co column densities along the line - of - sight ( to both the sun and to the observer ) are sufficiently large that optical depth effects tend to produce a flattening of the spatial profile near the nucleus that mimics the effect of a distributed source ( the ultraviolet case has been discussed by * ? ? ?",
    "this concern was addressed by @xcite in their analysis of co in comet hale - bopp .",
    "they found a very high production rate of co relative to that of water , 24.1% , with half being from the nucleus and the other half from a distributed source . in the same comet",
    ", @xcite found an even higher relative abundance of co , 3741% , with 90% coming from a distributed source .",
    "@xcite questioned both of these results suggesting that they were the effect of a large infrared opacity , even though both @xcite and @xcite accounted for opacity effects . in any case",
    ", if such a distributed source were  it would imply an abundance in this comet an order of magnitude higher than that cited by @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic observations of four comets by _ fuse _  have opened a new window for the investigation of the physics and chemistry of the cometary coma .",
    "the high spectral resolution of _ fuse _  has made it possible to separate the multiple components of the co emission , while the high sensitivity has allowed the detection of fluorescent  emission pumped by solar radiation . both of these can be understood in terms of the dissociation processes of  and . despite the small sample ,",
    "it is clear that previous ultraviolet spectroscopic observations of co in comets including those from sounding rockets , _ iue _  and _ hst _  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) probably included these additional components of co that were not resolved , either spectrally or spatially , from the native ( `` cold '' ) co with the instrumentation used .",
    "photoelectron excitation contributes @xmath210% of the observed emission of the co @xmath16 ( 0,0 ) band and needs to be accounted for in deriving co production rates from _ fuse",
    "_  observations .",
    "we thank the _ fuse _  ground system personnel , particularly b.  roberts , t.  ake , a.  berman , b.  gawne , and j.  andersen , for their efforts in planning and executing these moving target observations .",
    "this work is partially based on data obtained for the guaranteed time team by the nasa - cnes - csa _ fuse _  mission operated by the johns hopkins university .",
    "financial support was provided by nasa contract nas5 - 32985 and nasa grant nag5 - 12963 .",
