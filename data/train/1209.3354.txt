    "nano optomechanical systems that couple optical degree of freedom to the mechanical motion of a cantilever have been extensively investigated in recent past @xcite . in such systems , coupling is obtained via radiation pressure inside a cavity @xcite , and indirectly via quantum dots @xcite or ions @xcite .",
    "significant progress has been made in the investigation of optomechanics , such as squeezing @xcite , ultrahigh precision displacement detection @xcite , mass detection @xcite , gravational wave detection @xcite , and the transition between classical and quantum behaviour of a mechanical system @xcite . moreover , entangling the electromagnetic field with motional degree of freedom of mechanical systems have been explored in various approaches @xcite .",
    "the entanglement generated in such systems is significant both philosophically as well as technically in relation with quantum informatics @xcite .",
    "further advances in experimental techniques make possible to couple the mechanical resonators with the statistical ensemble of atoms . in such systems ,",
    "the interaction is mediated by the field inside the cavity that couples the mechanical resonators to the internal and motional degrees of freedom of the atoms @xcite .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    the normal mode splitting ( nms ) is the coupling of two degenerate modes with energy exchange taking place on a time scale faster then the decoherence rate .",
    "moreover , the nms is a phenomena ubiquitous in both the classical and quantum physics .",
    "the nms , in the transmission spectrum of the cavity filed , has been observed when atoms are coupled to cavity field @xcite .",
    "moreover , the nms has also been studied with artificial atoms in circuit quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) @xcite as well as in single quantum dot cavity qed @xcite . in this paper , we study the occurrence of the nms through a new optomechanical system , i.e , a coupled bec - cavity configuration @xcite .",
    "briefly , the system consists of fabry - prot cavity containing a condensate that effectively behaves like a vibrating mirror @xcite . in such systems , the collective density excitation of the bec serves the analogy of a moving mirror coupled to cavity field via radiation pressure force .",
    "the strong coupling of the quantized cavity field with the collective oscillations of the bec has been experimentally analyzed with all the atoms are being in the same motional state @xcite .",
    "our study reveals that the frequency and the decoherence rate are sensitive to radiation pressure force .",
    "we further analyze the occurrence of nms in the position spectrum of the condensate mode .",
    "it is observed that the position spectrum of the condensate mode splits into two peaks when coupling between condensate mode and intracavity field is considered .",
    "in addition , we also discuss the nms in the fluctuations spectrum of the light field emitted by the cavity .",
    "we show that the distance between two peaks increases linearly with bec - cavity field interaction .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section 2 , we give the theoretical model of the system and its coupling with the environment by using the heisenberg - langevin equations . in section 3 , we solve the dynamics in frequency domain and discuss the results .",
    "finally , we provide concluding remarks in section 4 .",
    "we consider an ensemble of @xmath0 two level bosonic atoms with resonant frequency @xmath1 is trapped inside a fabry - prot cavity and interact with standing - wave light field as shown in fig.[system ] .",
    "we assume the atom - field detuning @xmath2 is very large , therefore , one can adiabatically eliminate the excited atomic level . in the rotating frame at the driving field frequency @xmath3 ,",
    "the hamiltonian of the bose - einstein condensate in the limit of small atom - atom interaction and small value of the external potential can be written as follows @xcite : @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 . here",
    ", @xmath0 is the number of bec atoms , @xmath1 is the transition frequency and @xmath10 accounts for the coupling strength between the single intracavity photon and single condensate atom .",
    "the first term in the eq.([ham ] ) stands for the energy of the intracavity mode with creation ( annihilation ) operator @xmath11 and frequency @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , the empty cavity resonance frequency @xmath13 is shifted due to the presence of the bec inside the cavity by an amount of @xmath14 .",
    "the second term describes the energy of the bogoliubov mode of the collective oscillations of the bec .",
    "furthermore , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are , respectively , the creation ( annihilation ) operators and frequency of the condensate mode .",
    "the dynamics of the bec can be explained as follows : the zero momentum state is only coupled to the symmetric momentum states , @xmath17 , due to the absorption and stimulated emission of the cavity photons @xcite .",
    "this can be explained as the condensate mode oscillates at frequency @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the mass of the atom and @xmath20 is recoil frequency .",
    "the third term describes the interaction between intracavity field with condensate mode .",
    "moreover , @xmath21 accounts for the strength of interaction between field and bec and it is clear from the expression of the @xmath21 that the single atom - photon coupling is increased by the square root of the number of condensate atoms .",
    "the last term corresponds to the coupling between cavity mode and input laser field with coupling strength e and it is related to the input power @xmath22 with @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the decay rate of the cavity field .",
    "trapped inside a fabry - prot cavity of length @xmath25 is interacting with standing laser field . here , the left - end mirror is transmissive while the right - end mirror is perfectly reflecting .",
    "moreover , the cavity is being driven by a laser of frequency @xmath26.,width=321,height=96 ]    [ [ section-1 ] ]    in order to describe the complete dynamics of the subsystems involved in this problem , an adequate choice is to use the formalism of the quantum langevin equations . according to the heisenberg - langevin equation of motion ,",
    "the commutation relations @xmath27=1 $ ] and @xmath28=1 $ ] , the time evolution of the @xmath29 and @xmath30 , can be obtained .",
    "we derive the heisenberg - langevin equations for canonical variables and introduce the noise operators @xmath31 and @xmath32 weighted with the rates @xmath24 and @xmath33 which describe the dissipation of the intracavity field and condensate mode of collective oscillations of the bec respectively .",
    "therefore , heisenberg - langevin equations for condensate mode and intracavity field are given by @xmath34 we assume that the noise associated with the light field is uncorrelated with the noise accounts for the condensate mode . for laser field ,",
    "the noise and damping are due to the vacuum noise , losses from the cavity and fluctuations of the laser field . moreover , the noise and damping accounts for condensate mode are due to the condensate atoms with additional nearby non - condensed atoms . in addition ,",
    "@xmath35 and @xmath32 are the non - commuting noise operators associated with optical field and condensate mode respectively .",
    "they have zero mean values and nonzero correlation functions @xcite : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the occupation numbers of the optical and condensate modes , respectively .",
    "moreover , all other correlations are zero .",
    "as we are in optical regime and a bec at a temperature of at most a few @xmath39 , therefore one can take @xmath40 .",
    "in the following we linearized the operators in eq.([hle ] ) around the steady state values , @xmath41 , @xmath42 . here , we have assumed that the fluctuation operators @xmath43 and @xmath44 have zero mean .",
    "the steady state value of the intracavity mode is @xmath45 , where the total effective detuning is @xmath46 for the sake of simplicity we assume that the field is real positive and this can be achieved by adjusting the phase of the laser field .",
    "similarly , the steady state value of the condensate mode is @xmath47\\left < c\\,\\right>_{ss}$ ] .",
    "we linearize the langevin equations of motion given in eq.([hle ] ) , and assume that pump field is intense and keep terms only up to first order in the fluctuation operators .",
    "we rewrite each heisenberg operator in eq.([hle ] ) as a sum of steady state value and fluctuation operator with zero mean value .",
    "therefore , the linearized heisenberg - langevin equations are , @xmath48 the linearized quantum langevin equations show the fluctuations of the bogoliubov mode as the collective oscillation of the bec .",
    "the condensate mode is now coupled to the cavity field quadrature fluctuations by the effective couplings @xmath49 which can be made very large by increasing the amplitude @xmath50 of the intracavity field .",

    ", we introduce the displacement spectrum of bogoliubov mode of collective oscillation of the bec which is obtained from the two - frequency auto - correlation function @xmath56 .",

    "the spectrum of condensate mode is described by the effective susceptibility @xmath64 and displacement spectrum of collective oscillation of the bec which consists of two terms , the first term is proportional to quantum fluctuation of the radiation pressure and , second term arises from quantum noises associated with the matter waves .",
    "therefore , the position spectrum of the condensate mode is determined by radiation pressure and quantum noise .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    for our numerical calculations , we choose the parameters very close to the bec - cavity system @xcite .",

    "the optical spring effect leads to the shift in the frequency of the condensate mode and this shift is small for low - frequency oscillators",
    "@xcite and shift is significant for high - frequency oscillators @xcite . in fig.[weff1 ] , we plot normalized effective frequency @xmath69 of bogoliubov mode of collective oscillation of the bec as a function of the normalized frequency @xmath70 for three different values of the bec - intracavity field interaction , @xmath71 ( solid blue curve ) , @xmath72 ( dashed green curve ) , and @xmath73 ( red dotted curve ) .",
    "it is noted that the deviation in the bare frequency of the condensate mode @xmath74 is increased as the coupling between bec and intracavity field is increased . in fig.[geff2 ] , we plot the normalized effective damping rate @xmath75 of the condensate mode versus normalized frequency @xmath76 for different values of the bec - field interaction . the effective damping rate of the condensate mode is significantly increased as the bec - field interaction is increased as shown in fig.[geff2 ] . therefore , strong atom - field interaction causes higher atomic loss and this atomic loss is maximum near the resonance .",
    "the back action of the light causes the heating of the atoms , and as a consequence , atomic loss was observed in @xcite .",
    "the increase in the effective damping is at the basis of cooling of bogoliubov mode of the bec .",
    "the bec couples to the intracavity field due to radiation pressure force and radiation pressure behaves as an thermal reservoir for the bec resonator .",
    "the effective temperature of the bogoliubov mode of the condensate takes the value between initial thermal reservoir temperature and optical reservoir .",
    "therefore , when @xmath77 one achieves the ground state cooling of the bogoliubov mode .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    in fig.[spe ] , we plot the displacement spectrum of the bec as a function of the normalized detuning @xmath78 and normalized frequency @xmath76 for two different values of the bec field interaction , _ i.e _ , @xmath71 , fig.[s1 ] , and @xmath72 , fig.[s2 ] .",
    "for small value of interaction between condensate mode and cavity field , i.e @xmath71 , the fluctuations spectrum of the bogoliubov mode barely shows the normal mode splitting .",
    "as we increase the coupling strength , the normal mode splitting becomes observable . for @xmath79 , the normal mode splitting",
    "is clearly seen in fig.[s2 ] .",
    "it is observed that the normal mode splits in the presence of the large coupling between bec and field .",
    "the normal mode splitting is due to the hybridization of the two oscillators : the electromagnetic field and collective oscillations of the bec mode .",
    "the normal modes splitting results from the mixing of the fluctuations of the cavity field with the fluctuations of the condensate .",
    "the normal mode occurs at frequencies @xmath80 . in this expression",
    ", we neglect the cavity decay rate @xmath24 and damping rate of the bogoliubov mode .",

    ", one can see that only single peak ( solid blue curve ) is appeared in the fluctuations spectrum of the output field . however , as the interaction of the intracavity field with bec is @xmath72 increased , the spectrum splits into two peaks ( red dotted curve ) . for @xmath90 ,",
    "we observe @xmath91 further splits into two sideband peaks .",
    "this splitting is pure result of the coupling between condensate mode and cavity mode .",

    "this splitting depends linearly on the coupling parameter @xmath92 and goes to zero in the absence of bec - field coupling .",
