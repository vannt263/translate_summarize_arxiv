    "the transport of biopolymers through nanopores is a challenging problem both for polymer physics and molecular biology .",
    "it has received great attention in both experimental and theoretical studies due to its important role in many crucial biological processes , such as mrna translocation across nuclear pores , the threading of proteins through biological membrane channel @xcite , and the viral injection of dna into host cells @xcite .",
    "recent experiments show that the translocation processes have potential biotechnological applications , including rapid dna or rna sequencing @xcite , gene therapy @xcite , filtration , and controlled drug delivery @xcite .",
    "due to the loss of the accessible degrees of freedom , the passage of polymer through a nanopore faces a large entropic barrier and needs an external force to overcome it .",
    "the driving force can be provided by an external applied electric field in the pore @xcite , a pulling force exerted on the end of a polymer @xcite , a chemical potential , binding particles ( chaperones ) @xcite , longitudinal drag flow in a nanochannel @xcite , or geometrical confinement of the polymer @xcite .",
    "most of previous studies focused on translocation into an unconfined _ trans _ side .",
    "the dynamics of polymer translocation into a confined space through a nanopore is of great importance , because it is related to many biological processes , such as the bacterial gene swapping and dna prepackaging @xcite .",
    "experimentally , smith _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have found that the rate of packaging is constant until about @xmath2 of the dna is packaged , then dramatically decreases .",
    "in addition , they have also observed the pause during the packaging process .",
    "using langevin dynamics simulations we have investigated the dynamics of polymer translocation into the regions between two parallel plane walls and a fluidic channel @xcite . compared with an unconfined environment , the translocation dynamics is greatly changed due to the entropic resisting force induced by crowding effect of the partially translocated monomers . for polymer translocation into a closed confinement , experimental results for the rate of packaging and the pause @xcite",
    "have been confirmed by stochastic rotation dynamics simulations @xcite and langevin dynamics simulations @xcite .",
    "most recently , using langevin dynamics simulations we have investigated the dynamics of polymer translocation into a circular nanocontainer through a nanopore under a driving force @xcite . we have further found that the translocation time distribution and the scaling exponent of the translocation time as chain length depend on the average density of the whole chain in the nanocontainer .",
    "certainly , for the prepackaging of dna into the virus capsid , electrostatic charges should be considered . as noted by ali _",
    "@xcite , when dna charge is less screened or the debye length increases , the packing becomes more difficult and may stop midway .",
    "interestingly , ali _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have already observed that capsid geometries play very important role in the packaging and ejection dynamics of polymers . for a flexible polymer a sphere packs more quickly and",
    "ejects more slowly than an ellipsoid .",
    "however , in their simulations the lengths of the major axis and minor axis of the ellipsoid are fixed , and thus it is still not clear how the aspect ratio ( anisotropy ) of the ellipsoid affects the packaging dynamics .",
    "in addition , in their simulations polymer translocation into the ellipsoid only through its major axis is explored .",
    "an interesting question is what is the difference for polymer packaging into the same ellipsoid through its major axis and minor axis ?    to this end , using langevin dynamics ( ld ) simulations , we investigate the dynamics of a flexible polymer translocation through nanopores into an anisotropic confinement .",
    "we emphasize the influence of the aspect ratio of the ellipsoid and translocation direction on the translocation dynamics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly describe our model and the simulation technique . in sec .",
    "iii , we present our results . finally , the conclusions and discussion are presented in sec .",
    "in our simulations , the polymer is a coarse - grained chain of lennard - jones ( lj ) particles with the finite extension nonlinear elastic ( fene ) potential @xcite .",
    "the excluded volume interaction between beads is generated by a short range repulsive lj potential : @xmath3 + \\varepsilon,\\ ] ] for @xmath4 and 0 for @xmath5 .",
    "here , @xmath6 is the diameter of a bead and @xmath7 is the depth of potential .",
    "the connectivity between neighboring beads is modeled as a fene spring with @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the distance between consecutive beads , @xmath10 is the spring constant and @xmath11 is the maximum allowed separation between connected beads .    .",
    "the lengths of the semi - axis on @xmath12 and @xmath13 directions are @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively ]    we consider a two - dimensional geometry as depicted by fig . [ fig1 ] , where the process of polymer translocation into a confinement through a nanopore driven by a transmembrane electric field ( or molecular motor for real biological system ) is shown .",
    "the shape of the confinement is described by @xmath16 where @xmath14 is the length of semi - axis along the @xmath12 axis and @xmath15 is the length of semi - axis along the @xmath13 axis .",
    "the confinement is a two - dimensional sphere for @xmath17 and a two - dimensional ellipsoid for @xmath18 .",
    "the setup of the confinement is modeled as a hard shell with a pore of width @xmath19 , which is formed by stationary wall particles within a distance @xmath6 from each other .",
    "the entrance permits the translocation of one monomer at a time . between all monomer - wall particle pairs",
    ", there exits the same short range repulsive lj interaction as shown above . in langevin dynamics simulation ,",
    "each monomer is subjected to conservative , frictional and random forces , respectively , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the monomer s mass , @xmath22 is the friction coefficient , @xmath23 is the bead s velocity , and @xmath24 is the random force satisfying the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite . the external driving force is expressed as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the external force strength exerted exclusively on the beads in the pore , and @xmath27 is a unit vector in the direction along the pore axis .    in the present work ,",
    "we use the lj parameters @xmath7 , @xmath6 , and bead mass @xmath21 to fix the system energy , length , and mass scales , respectively .",
    "the time scale is given by @xmath28 , and the force scale is @xmath29 . to mimic single - stranded dna , we choose @xmath30 nm @xcite and the bead mass @xmath31 amu @xcite .",
    "we set @xmath32 , so the interaction strength @xmath7 corresponds to @xmath33 j at actual temperature 295 k. thus , this leads to a time scale of 32.1 ps and a force scale of 2.3 pn @xcite . in our simulations",
    ", the dimensionless parameters are chosen to be @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 unless otherwise stated .",
    "corresponding to the range of voltages used in the experiments @xcite , the driving force @xmath26 is set between 2 and 15 .",
    "the langevin equation is integrated in time by the method proposed by ermak and buckholz @xcite .",
    "initially , the first monomer is placed at the pore center , while the remaining monomers are undergoing thermal collisions described by the langevin thermostat to reach the equilibrium state of the system .",
    "typically , each simulation data is the average result of over 1000 successful translocation events to minimize statistical errors . here",
    ", we defined the successful translocation as the event when the whole chain enters into the confinement .",
    "although the chain conformation of a polymer confined in a slit or a tube has been broadly studied @xcite , it is still a challenging problem for a polymer confined to a closed anisotropic system . for a polymer of chain length",
    "@xmath37 confined to an ellipsoid , we define a parameter @xmath38 to characterize the aspect ratio ( anisotropy ) of the ellipsoid ,    @xmath39    the density of beads in the two - dimensional ellipsoid is @xmath40 according to the blob picture , a confined chain forms a self - avoiding walk consisting of @xmath41 blob with size @xmath42 .",
    "each blob contains @xmath43 beads , where @xmath44 being the flory exponent in two dimensions @xcite and @xmath45 is a constant , depending on the temperature and the solvent .",
    "then , the density of beads in a blob is @xmath46 based on the relation of @xmath47 , we obtain the number of blobs @xmath48 thus , for a polymer with a fixed chain length @xmath37 , @xmath41 is determined only by the area of the confinement ( @xmath49 ) , independent of its shape .",
    "certainly , the above scaling arguments can only work as long as the minor axis is larger than the blob diameter .    for polymer confined in an isotropic space ,",
    "the free energy cost is proportional to the number of blobs . in units of @xmath50",
    ", it is @xmath51 which indicates that the free energy only depends on the area of the confinement for a fixed chain length .",
    "however , for polymer confined in an ellipsoid with the same area as the sphere , the blob tends to orient along the major axis .",
    "thus , the free energy @xmath52 should include another term for the blob orientation which depends on the shape of the ellipsoid .",
    "compared with polymer confined in sphere , the free energy for polymer confined in ellipsoid is higher . for polymer packaging ,",
    "once the translocated chain is confined , the resisting force should be larger for the ellipsoid than that for the sphere with the same volume . as a result",
    ", an ellipsoid packs more slowly than a sphere , and with increasing the aspect ratio of the ellipsoid the packaging rate should decrease . certainly , for nonequilibrated packaging process the shape dependent free energy implies more complicated translocation dynamics .    during the translocation process , with increasing the translocated monomers the entropic resisting force @xmath53 increases and",
    "depends on the shape of the confinement .",
    "owing to the highly nonequilibrium nature of the translocation process and the dependence of the shape of the confinement , it is difficult to calculate @xmath53 . here",

    ", @xmath61 corresponds to translocation into a sphere .",
    "the shape of the ellipsoid does not change but its orientation changes for the pairs of @xmath62 and 8 , @xmath63 and 4 , @xmath64 and 2 , respectively .",
    "here , @xmath65 and @xmath66 denote translocation into the ellipsoid along the minor - axis and the major - axis directions , respectively .       for @xmath67 and different shapes of the ellipsoid @xmath38 and densities of the chain @xmath0 . the solid line with @xmath68 is drawn to guide the eyes .",

    "@xmath71 , the effective driving forces @xmath57 are dominant , and the shape of the ellipsoid does nt matter for @xmath70 .",
    "however , for weak driving forces @xmath72 the entropic resisting forces @xmath60 are important , and interestingly we observe that @xmath70 depends on the shape of the ellipsoid .    to see the shape - dependence of @xmath70 more clearly , we show the @xmath70 as a function of @xmath0 under @xmath69 for different @xmath38 , see fig .",

    "this is because at the early stage of the translocation process the translocated monomers are more confined for @xmath75 compared with the cases for @xmath76 .       as a function of the aspect ratio of the ellipsoid @xmath38 for @xmath77 and @xmath78 under the density of chain @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",

    "<S> using langevin dynamics simulations , we investigate the dynamics of a flexible polymer translocation into a confined area under a driving force through a nanopore . </S>",
    "<S> we choose an ellipsoidal shape for the confinement and consider the dependence of the asymmetry of the ellipsoid measured by the aspect ratio on the translocation time . </S>",
    "<S> compared with an isotropic confinement ( sphere ) , an anisotropic confinement ( ellipsoid ) with the same volume slows down the translocation , and the translocation time increases with increasing the aspect ratio of the ellipsoid . we further find that it takes different time for polymer translocation into the same ellipsoid through major - axis and minor - axis directions , depending on the average density of the whole chain in the ellipsoid , @xmath0 . for @xmath0 lower than a critical value @xmath1 , the translocation through minor axis is faster , and vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> these complicated behaviors are interpreted by the degree of the confinement and anisotropic confinement induced folding of the translocated chain . </S>"
