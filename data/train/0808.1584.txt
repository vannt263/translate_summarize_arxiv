    "in 1982 , joyce introduced the term `` quandle '' for the algebraic structure defined by translating the reidemeister moves into axioms for a binary operation corresponding to one strand crossing under another @xcite . in 1992 , fenn and rourke generalized the category of quandles to the larger category of `` racks , '' whose axioms derive from framed isotopy moves @xcite . the same concepts appear under different names in the literature ; quandles are called `` distributive groupoids '' in @xcite , a special case of quandle is called `` kei '' in @xcite and racks are described as `` automorphic sets '' in @xcite .",

    "the operator groups of such racks are related to coxeter groups ; see @xcite for more .    replacing @xmath1 with @xmath0 yields finite coxeter racks , which are suitable for use as target racks for counting invariants of knots and links as described in @xcite . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "quandle counting invariants are enhanced by making use of the module structure of the coloring quandles and biquandles , resulting in knot and link invariants which contain more information than the counting invariants alone . in this paper",
    ", we will apply the same idea to the counting invariants defined by finite coxeter racks , obtaining a new family of enhanced rack counting invariants of knots and links .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ rq ]",
    "we review racks and the rack counting invariant . in section [ crq ]",
    "we review coxeter racks and make a few observations . in section [ inv ] we define the enhanced coxeter rack invariants and give examples demonstrating that the enhanced invariants are strictly stronger than the unenhanced rack counting invariants . in section [ q ]",

    "rack axiom ( i ) says that every element @xmath2 acts on @xmath3 via a bijection @xmath4 , @xmath5 ; the inverse defines a second operation @xmath6 , and we have @xmath7 and @xmath8 for all @xmath9 .",

    "the idea is then to think of arcs in an oriented link diagram as generators and the operation @xmath10 as `` crosses under from right to left '' when looking in the positive direction of the overcrossing strand .",
    "the inverse operation @xmath36 then means `` crosses under from left to right . '' @xmath37 indeed , the rack axioms are simply the reidemeister moves required for framed isotopy interpreted in light of this operation ; see @xcite or @xcite for more .    given a link diagram @xmath38 , we obtain a rack presentation with one generator for each arc and one relation at each crossing .",
    "that is , the _ fundamental rack _",
    "@xmath39 of the framed link specified by the diagram is the set of equivalence classes of rack words under the equivalence relation generated by the crossing relations together with the rack axioms .",

    "for a finite rack @xmath31 , the _ rack rank _ of @xmath31 , denoted @xmath45 , is the exponent of the permutation given by the diagonal of the rack matrix .",
    "if two ambient isotopic link diagrams @xmath38 and @xmath46 have framing vectors with respect to an ordering on the components which are componentwise congruent mod @xmath45 , then there is a bijection between the sets of rack colorings of @xmath38 and @xmath46 by @xmath31 .",
    "we might say that as far as @xmath31 cares , the writhes of @xmath38 live in @xmath47 .",
