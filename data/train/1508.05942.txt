    "as the nearest early - type system , the milky way bulge provides a unique opportunity to study the details of its resolved stellar populations .",
    "five years ago , the presence of double red clump ( rc ) was discovered in the higher latitude ( @xmath0@xmath1 ) fields of the milky way bulge from wide - field photometric surveys ( @xcite ; @xcite ; ) .",
    "these and follow - up observations have established that ( 1 ) the two rcs have almost identical mean colours , ( 2 ) the double rc feature is only evident among metal - rich stars , while metal - poor populations show only faint rc , ( 3 ) the separation between the two rcs is vanished at low galactic latitudes , and ( 4 ) the relative strength of the two rcs changes strongly with longitude .",
    "these observations are widely accepted as evidence for the x - shaped bulge originated from the disk and bar instabilities , which led to the consensus that even higher latitude region of the milky way bulge has more characteristics of a `` pseudo bulge '' , rather than a classical bulge ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .    without the crucial distance information ,",
    "however , an alternative interpretation , in which the brighter rc is representing an intrinsically brighter subpopulation rather than a distance effect , must be explored in detail to see whether it can equally reproduce the key observations described above .",
    "it is now well established that most globular clusters ( gcs ) host multiple populations with helium and light - elements enhanced second and third generation stars , for which the origin can be traced back to the chemical enrichments and pollutions by asymptotic - giant - branch ( agb ) stars and/or fast - rotating massive - stars ( frms ) .",
    "some massive gcs , such as @xmath2  cen and terzan  5 , also show evidence for supernovae enrichment .",
    "chemical enrichments and pollutions similar to these might have affected stellar populations in the bulge as well .",
    "furthermore , proposed that bulge populations might be helium - enriched due to their super - solar metallicity and the helium enrichment parameter ( @xmath3 ) between 2 and 3 , with an average helium content of 0.31  0.35 .        in general ,",
    "super - helium - rich subpopulations are placed on the bluer horizontal - branch ( hb ) during the core helium - burning phase .",
    "however , when the metallicity is high enough as in the bulge , the strong metallicity effect overwhelms the helium effect , and the metal - rich counterpart would be placed on the brighter rc .",
    "this was correctly pointed out by @xcite in their investigation of the double rc observed in the metal - rich bulge gc terzan  5 @xcite .",
    "the double rc observed in terzan  5 is very analogous to that in the bulge in terms of the magnitude difference , metallicity , and population ratio .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite noted this similarity , but they dismissed this possibility in the bulge mostly based on the fact that the two rcs in terzan  5 , unlike the double rc in the bulge , also show the difference in colour .",
    "the colour of the rc stars , however , can vary with metallicity , helium abundance , or age , similarly to the case of more metal - poor hb stars ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see figure  [ f1 ] below ) .",
    "spectroscopic observations of red - giant - branch ( rgb ) and rc stars in the bulge field show a large range in metallicity , @xmath4 } \\leq 0.5}$ ] , with a mean metallicity at almost solar .",
    "the metallicity distribution functions ( mdfs ) derived from these observations show bimodality with metal - rich and metal - poor populations .",
    "a metallicity gradient is also observed in the bulge along the minor axis , in the sense that the fraction of the metal - rich population is decreased at high galactic latitudes .",
    "further showed that the @xmath5-elements enhancement is decreased at higher metallicities .",
    "many of these observations and recent theoretical studies have suggested a possibility of a composite bulge in the milky way , in which a classical bulge ( cb ) can coexist with a boxy pseudo bulge originated from the bar (; ; @xcite ; ; ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this composite bulge , low galactic latitude ( @xmath6 ) fields",
    "would be dominated by the most metal - rich bar population , while relatively metal - poor cb population becomes more and more important at higher latitudes (;",
    "; @xcite ; ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that , in such a composite bulge , the multiple population models can equally explain the presence of the double rc and other key observations in the milky way bulge .",
    "the rc stars are metal - rich counterpart of core helium - burning hb stars in metal - poor gcs . in order to study the rc populations in the bulge ,",
    "we have therefore constructed a series of synthetic hb models for the metal - rich populations , following the techniques developed by @xcite and as updated by @xcite .",
    "our models are based on the yonsei - yale ( @xmath7 ) hb evolutionary tracks and isochrones with enhanced helium abundance @xcite , all constructed under the assumption that @xmath8 = 0.3}$ ] .",
    "following our recent investigations for the halo gcs with multiple populations @xcite , mass - loss parameter @xmath9 was adopted to be 0.40 , and the mass dispersion on the rc was adopted to be @xmath10 for each subpopulation .    in our multiple population models for the cb component of the bulge ,",
    "the faint rc ( frc ) is produced by first - generation stars ( g1 ) , which were assumed to follow the standard helium enrichment parameter ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) , while the brighter rc ( brc ) is populated by super - helium - rich ( y = 0.39 ) second - generation stars ( g2 ) .",
    "the choice of y = 0.39 for g2 is based on the empirical constraint from super - helium - rich subpopulations in @xmath2  cen @xcite , which is also comparable with the theoretical predictions for the helium content in the ejecta of both super - agb stars and type ii supernovae @xcite .",
    "note further that this choice of helium abundances for g1 and g2 ( y = 0.27 & 0.39 at z = 0.02 ) , in the mean ( y = 0.33 ) , is consistent with the suggestion from the analysis of the red giant - branch bump of the milky way bulge (;",
    "spectroscopy of rc stars in the bulge indicates that stars in brc are somewhat more metal - rich ( 0.12  0.23 dex ) than those in frc , and therefore the metallicity difference between g2 and g1 was assumed to be @xmath13 = 0.2}$ ] dex in our models .",
    "the ages for g1 and g2 were adopted to be 12  gyr and 10  gyr , respectively @xcite , and the two rcs are assumed to be equally populated @xcite .",
    "figure  [ f1 ] shows our models for the two rcs from g1 and g2 in the @xmath14 colour magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .",
    "the models are presented at four different metallicity regimes relevant to the milky way bulge to illustrate the sensitivity of the double rc feature on metallicity .",
    "it is clear from the models in panel ( b ) that the separation in magnitude between the two rcs ( @xmath150.5 mag ) is analogous to the observed difference , while the colour difference is negligible as is observed .",
    "more metal - poor models in panel ( c ) demonstrate , however , that , when the metallicity is decreased , the helium - rich g2 start to leave the rc regime to the bluer hb , while helium - normal g1 are placed on the frc .",
    "when the metallicity is decreased further as in panel ( d ) , all the core helium - burning stars produced by g2 are completely out of the brc and are placed on the blue hb , while those from g1 are still on the frc or red hb .",
    "this case is qualitatively similar to the extended hb morphology observed in gcs with multiple populations such as ngc 2808 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "consequently , no double rc would be observed in the relatively metal - poor population .",
    "this is mainly because helium - rich stars evolve more rapidly , and hence have lower masses at given age ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "interestingly , the most metal - rich models in panel ( a ) show that the separation between the two rcs would be diminished or vanished in super - metal - rich ( @xmath16 \\geq 0.2}$ ] ) population .",
    "this is because even g1 , following the standard @xmath11 , becomes very helium - rich ( @xmath17 ) at super - metal - rich regime , increasing the luminosity of frc . in a two - component composite bulge",
    ", this most metal - rich regime would be more relevant to the bar component .    the helium enhanced evolutionary tracks adopted in our modeling were constructed under the assumption that @xmath18 } = 0.3}$ ] for all @xmath19}}$ ] regimes . in the bulge fields ,",

    "panels ( e )  ( h ) of figure  [ f1 ] show our rc models constructed for @xmath18}=0.0}$ ] . at solar metallicity ( @xmath19 } \\approx 0.0}$ ] ) , the scaled - solar ( @xmath18}=0.0}$ ] ) models",
    "are fainter by @xmath210.1 mag compared to the @xmath20-enhanced ( @xmath18}=0.3}$ ] ) models , but the magnitude difference between the two rcs is little affected .",
    "furthermore , according to ( * ? ? ?",

    "the magnitude difference between the two rcs is @xmath24 mag , while the colour difference is negligible , @xmath25 , which are in reasonable agreements with the observed differences ( see figure  [ f3 ] ) .",
    "similar results are obtained even if the peak metallicity and age are varied by @xmath15@xmath26 dex and @xmath15@xmath27  gyr . }",

    "ages for g1 and g2 are identical to those adopted for the cb models ( i.e. , 12 & 10  gyr , respectively ) .",
    "our models show that a larger difference in metal abundance ( @xmath13 } = 0.5 $ ] dex ) between g2 and g1 in terzan  5 is mainly responsible for the observed colour difference between the two rcs , while a smaller difference in helium abundance is also a contributing factor .",
    "if no difference in age is adopted between g1 and g2 for terzan 5 , as was assumed by @xcite , the magnitude and colour differences are reduced by @xmath150.05 and @xmath150.01 mag , respectively .",
    "the panel ( b ) of figure  [ f2 ] also presents our model for the bar component of the bulge , in which we assume that only metal - rich g1 ( with an age of 10  gyr ) is populated considering the disk origin of the bar population .",
    "following the observed mdf for the most metal - rich bar component , a gaussian mdf with the mean @xmath29 } = + 0.15 $ ] and @xmath30 } = 0.10 $ ]  dex is adopted . as described above , this super - metal - rich g1 , following the standard @xmath31 , becomes relatively helium - rich ( @xmath32  0.31 ) and thus produces relatively bright ( @xmath33  mag ) rc stars that would be placed between the brc ( g2 ) and frc ( g1 ) of the cb model in panel ( c ) .",
    "the panel ( d ) of figure  [ f2 ] shows the cmd of the overlapping populations ( i.e. , cb + bar ) . in order to reproduce the low latitude fields of the bulge ,",
    "the population ratio between the bar and cb is adopted to be 2:1 . in this case , the split in the rc is not clear , but the gaussian decomposition indicates two components separated by @xmath150.30 mag , which is in reasonable agreement with the observed smaller difference at low galactic latitudes , such as the baade s window .    , @xmath34 mag )",
    "are included in our simulations . ]    ) field of the bulge ( 2mass data from @xcite ; figure 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "note that the observed cmd is contaminated by the foreground disk stars at @xmath35 and 0.7 . ]",
    "our models can reproduce all of the key observations described in section 1 .",
    "firstly , as described above , the observed magnitude difference ( @xmath150.5 mag ) between the two rcs is reproduced while maintaining no or little colour difference between them ( see figure  [ f2 ] ) .",
    "secondly , the double rc feature is reproduced only for the relatively metal - rich ( @xmath16 } \\geq -0.4 $ ] ) populations as suggested from the observations .",
    "our models for the metal - poor populations in the bulge show only frc ( see figure  [ f1 ] lower panel ) , because , unless very metal - rich ( @xmath16 } \\geq -0.4 $ ] ) , super - helium - rich g2 can not be trapped on the brc .",
    "thirdly , as illustrated by a schematic diagram in figure  [ f4 ] ( three vertical panels ) , the latitude dependence of the double rc feature can be explained within a two - component composite bulge . at low latitudes ,",
    "the bulge is dominated by the most metal - rich bar population with only g1 , which , on the rc , is placed between the two rcs from a minority cb component , completely filling the gap of the double rc . at higher latitudes ,",
    "however , contribution from the bar component is decreased / vanished , while the cb component ( with g1 and g2 ) becomes more and more important , producing a larger magnitude difference between the two rcs with increasing @xmath36 .",
    "finally , in a two - component bulge with a spheroidal cb embedded in a tilted bar ( pseudo bulge ) , the longitude dependence of the rc luminosity function can be reproduced in our model as well . as also illustrated in figure  [ f4 ] ( three horizontal panels ) , the observed luminosity function , in our scenario , is the sum of a cb component ( with double rc ) and a metal - rich bar component ( with single rc ) . towards negative longitudes the bar component is placed at the far side of the bulge and therefore frc becomes gradually more populated , while the opposite effect is anticipated towards positive longitudes .",
    "most of these observations were obtained in @xmath37 fields ( see figure  11 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the cb component is expected to be comparable to the bar component in terms of population ratio .",
    "more detailed population models that fully take into account the observed mdf and its dependence on galactic latitude and longitude will be presented in our forthcoming paper ( in preparation ) , where we will also compare the observed rc luminosity functions with the models constructed under various combinations of input parameters .",
    "the kinematics of rc and giant stars in the bulge can provide further constraints on our models .",
    "the radial velocity ( @xmath38 ) measurements show that the bulge rotates cylindrically , which is a strong evidence for the bar at low latitude fields ( @xmath39@xmath1 ) . for the higher latitudes , however , this is not necessarily inconsistent with our cb dominated scenario in this region of the bulge , because , for example , @xcite showed that an initially non - rotating cb could absorb a significant fraction of the angular momentum from the bar within a few gyr .",
    "the observed kinematics of stars in the two rcs are also consistent with our scenario . at @xmath40 , found an excess of stars moving towards the sun in the brc , while that receding from the sun is observed in the frc . in our composite bulge scenario , this can be understood by the depth ( @xmath152 kpc ; @xmath41 0.5  mag ) effect of the bar . since the rcs from the bar and cb",
    "are mixed in the cmd of this field , rc stars in near side of the bar would be superimposed on brc from cb , while those in far side of the bar is mixed with frc from cb . therefore , if the stars in the bar are in streaming motions , we would see some difference in @xmath38 , in the mean , between brc and frc . at higher latitudes ( @xmath42 & @xmath43 ) , however , there is no difference in @xmath38 between the two rcs , which is consistent with our cb ( with multiple populations ) dominated scenario in these regions of the bulge .",
    "the distance measurements for the two rcs from soon to be released gaia trigonometric parallax data would provide the most direct test for the suggested model . if the two rcs are due to the x - shaped structure , @xmath150.5 mag difference in the distance modulus is expected between the brc and frc , while essentially no difference , in the mean , is predicted in our multiple population models .",
    "this should settle the issue once and for all .",
    "if confirmed , our result would suggest that the bar in the milky way bulge is not sufficiently buckled to form the x - shaped structure to be observed as double rc at higher latitudes ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "furthermore , if the split rc is mostly due to the effect of multiple populations , rather than a distance effect , the previous studies on the structure of the milky way bulge and bar based on rc , high latitude fields in particular , should be reexamined in the new paradigm .",
    "finally , our result for the cb component of the milky way bulge , the nearest early - type system , would also suggest that the early - type galaxies would be similarly prevailed by super - helium - rich subpopulation .",
    "if @xmath1550% of stars in early - type galaxies are helium and light elements enhanced g2 , this would have profound impacts on the interpretation of integrated spectra by employing population synthesis models , such as the origins of the na enhanced giant elliptical galaxies @xcite and the uv upturn phenomenon @xcite .",

    "we also thank sang - il han for his assistance in obtaining the observed data for figure 3 .",
