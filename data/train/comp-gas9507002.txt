    "the lattice boltzmann equation ( lbe ) method has become a promising tool for simulation of transport phenomena in recent years .",
    "great success has been achieved in applying lbe for various flow problems such as hydrodynamics @xcite , flow through porous media @xcite , magnetohydrodynamics @xcite , multiphase flow @xcite , reaction - diffusion equation @xcite , and particle suspensions @xcite . compared to its precursor , the lattice gas automata ( lga ) ,",
    "lbe method is more computationally efficient using current parallel computers , and some artifacts like non - galilean invariance in lga can be eliminated in lbe .",
    "careful qualitative comparisons of lbe with traditional computational fluid dynamics methods showed that the method is accurate , and capable of simulating complex phenomena @xcite .",
    "although it has been proved @xcite that the lbe recovers the navier - stokes equation with a second - order of accuracy in space and time in the interior of flow domain , the real hydrodynamic boundary conditions have not been well studied .",
    "the no - slip condition on the wall is one of the examples .",
    "the classical model for the non - moving wall boundary condition in lbe is the so - called bounce - back rule borrowed from the lga method . under the bounce - back rule ,",
    "all the particles colliding with walls bounce back to the flow domain in the same direction , theoretical discussion and computational experience indicate that the bounce - back rule actually gives a zero velocity half way between the bounce back row and the first row in the flow and it introduces an error of first - order in lattice spacing for lga and lbe @xcite . to solve this problem , various boundary conditions",
    "@xcite have been proposed to replace the bounce - back rule and progress has been made . in @xcite , a boundary condition for the triangular ( fhp ) lbgk model",
    "was proposed for any given velocity boundary , the boundary condition generated results of machine accuracy for plane poiseuille flow . in @xcite , a non - slip boundary condition and prescribed pressure or velocity inlet condition for the 3-d 15-velocity direction lbgk model were proposed and results of good accuracy for various flows are achieved . however , due to the lack of the fundamental physical reasoning and the lack of mathematical analysis , these schemes have not revealed the general nature of boundary conditions .",
    "recently we have developed @xcite a new technique to analytically solve the lbgk equation for 2-d poiseuille flow and couette flow .",
    "this technique provides us a useful tool to analyze the error generated by various boundary conditions . in this study",

    "<S> in this paper , we study the two dimensional lattice boltzmann bgk model ( lbgk ) by analytically solving a simple flow in a 2  -d channel . </S>",
    "<S> the flow is driven by the movement of upper boundary with vertical injection fluid at the porous boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity profile is shown to satisfy a second - order finite - difference form of the simplified incompressible navier - stokes equation . with the analysis </S>",
    "<S> , different boundary conditions can be studied theoretically . </S>",
    "<S> a momentum exchange principle is also revealed at the boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> a general boundary condition for any given velocity boundary is proposed based on the analysis .    </S>",
