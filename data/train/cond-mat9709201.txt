    "structural information is of fundamental importance in addressing the chemical and physical properties of any system .",
    "unfortunately , there is no direct experimental method for determining the structure of free clusters in molecular beams .",
    "instead , one measures properties which depend on structure and employs models of the predicted favoured geometries .",
    "this approach has been combined with techniques such as electron diffraction,@xcite mass spectral abundances,@xcite chemical reactivity,@xcite magnetism@xcite and x - ray spectroscopy.@xcite the inversion of the experimental data to obtain structural information , though , can be problematic , and always relies on comparisons with the predictions of structural models .",
    "sizes exhibiting special stability are known for certain morphologies and classes of interatomic potential.@xcite the size - dependence of properties sometimes reveals these magic numbers , and thus enables a confident structural assignment to be made .",
    "however , often rather little is known about the structure between these magic numbers .",
    "one of the most powerful experimental techniques that addresses this deficiency is the flow - reactor approach which probes the chemical reactivity of size - selected clusters .",
    "for example , this method has been applied to nickel clusters to give detailed information for all sizes up to @xmath3=71.@xcite the results show that around @xmath3=13 and @xmath3=55 the clusters are icosahedral , in agreement with the observed magic numbers in other experiments.@xcite however , in the size range @xmath4 only one structural assignment has so far been made because of the large number of possible geometries to be considered and the presence of multiple isomers.@xcite    the theoretician can aid in the task of structural assignment by providing realistic candidate structures . indeed , many studies have modelling specific clusters , but _",
    "ab initio _ calculations are only feasible for small sizes , especially for transition metals , and so empirical potentials are often used . however , as is clear from the diversity of theoretical results obtained for nickel clusters,@xcite consensus between methods is lacking and it is hard to know which ( if any ) of the results should be believed .",
    "even with the simplified description of the interatomic interactions provided by an empirical potential , it can be an extremely difficult task to search the potential energy surface ( pes ) extensively enough to be confident that the global minimum has been found .",
    "also , many empirical potentials are too complicated to provide an understanding of the relationship between the potential and the observed structure and so little physical insight is gained .",
    "therefore , to understand cluster structure there is a need for a hierarchy of theoretical models from the general to the specific . in the present study we use a simple model to understand",
    "the structural effects of the range of the potential , and so provide one part of the framework for understanding the physical basis of cluster structure .",
    "we are confident that we have found most of the global minima giving the most comprehensive model of cluster structure in the small size regime .    -3 mm -3 mm    [ fig : fid ]    one of the most interesting aspects of cluster structure is the manifestation of non - crystallographic symmetries which arise from the absence of translational periodicity . in particular ,",
    "many clusters are found to have fivefold axes of symmetry , including two of the three main types of ordered structure adopted by simple atomic clusters .",
    "decahedra have a single fivefold axis of symmetry and are based on pentagonal bipyramids , while icosahedra have six fivefold axes of symmetry .",
    "the third morphology consists of close - packed clusters .",
    "particularly stable examples of each type are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fid ] .",
    "all the above morpholgies have been observed experimentally .",
    "many gas phase clusters have been shown to be icosahedral through the presence of the magic numbers associated with the mackay icosahedra@xcite in mass spectra : rare gases@xcite , metals,@xcite and molecular clusters.@xcite icosahedral and decahedral structures are also commonly reported for metal clusters supported on surfaces,@xcite and more recently fcc and decahedral clusters have been observed for gold clusters passivated by alkylthiolates.@xcite    all three structural types are also exhibited by lennard - jones ( lj ) clusters . for @xmath5 icosahedra are most stable ; from this size up to @xmath6 decahedra are most stable and above this fcc clusters.@xcite however , these changes do not occur abruptly .",
    "the global minimum of is the fcc truncated octahedron@xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fid](a ) ) and for at least six sizes with @xmath7 the global minimum is based upon a marks decahedron@xcite ( fig .  [ fig : fid](c ) ) . in this paper",
    "we consider a potential with variable range to provide a model system which exhibits a much greater diversity of structural behaviour than lj clusters in the small size regime .",
    "consequently , the results are relevant to a much wider range of systems .",
    "there have been a number of previous studies on the effect of the range of the potential on the structure and phase behaviour of small clusters.@xcite these have shown that the number of minima and saddle points on the pes increases as the range decreases  the pes becomes more rugged@xcite  and strained structures are destabilized . the latter effect results in range - induced transitions between the ordered morphologies,@xcite and the destabilization and disappearance of the liquid phase as the range is decreased.@xcite in a previous paper we examined morse clusters containing up to 25 atoms and a selection of larger sizes.@xcite here we consider morse clusters in the size range @xmath8 atoms .",
    "some of the lowest energy structures given here supersede the results of the previous paper .",
    "the morse potential@xcite may be written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the pair well depth and @xmath11 the equilibrium pair separation .",
    "we denote an @xmath3-atom cluster bound by the morse potential as m@xmath12 . in reduced units ( @xmath13 and",
    "@xmath14 ) there is a single adjustable parameter , @xmath15 , which determines the range of the interparticle forces .",
    "[ fig : morse ] shows that decreasing @xmath15 increases the range of the attractive part of the potential and softens the repulsive wall , thus widening the potential well .",
    "values of @xmath15 appropriate to a range of materials have been catalogued elsewhere.@xcite the lj potential has the same curvature at the bottom of the well as the morse potential when @xmath16 .",
    "girifalco has obtained an intermolecular potential for   molecules@xcite which is isotropic and short - ranged relative to the equilibrium pair separation , with an effective value of @xmath17.@xcite the alkali metals have longer - ranged interactions , for example @xmath15=3.15 has been suggested for sodium.@xcite fitting to bulk data gives a value of @xmath15=3.96 for nickel.@xcite    at absolute zero the structure with the lowest free energy is simply the global potential energy minimum of the pes . at higher temperatures , entropic factors",
    "must also be considered .",
    "although we only perform a comprehensive survey of the zero kelvin geometries , the structural effects of temperature are considered in the subsequent discussion .    to understand the structural effects of the range parameter , @xmath15 , it is instructive to look more closely at the form of the potential .",
    "the energy can be partitioned into three contributions : @xmath18 the number of nearest - neighbour contacts , @xmath19 , the strain energy , @xmath20 , and the contribution to the energy from non - nearest neighbours , @xmath21 , are given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is a nearest - neighbour criterion .",
    "@xmath25 is the strain in the contact between atoms @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the dominant term in the energy comes from @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath21 is a smaller term and its value varies in a similar manner to @xmath19 .",
    "it is only likely to be important in determining the lowest energy structures when other factors are equal .",
    "for example , bulk fcc and hexagonal close - packed ( hcp ) lattices both have twelve nearest neighbours per atom .",
    "next - nearest neighbour interactions are the cause of the lower energy of the hcp crystal when a pair potential such as the lj form is used.@xcite    @xmath20 , which measures the energetic penalty for the deviation of a nearest - neighbour distance from the equilibrium pair distance , is a key quantity in our analysis .",
    "it must not be confused with strain due to an applied external force . for a given geometry",
    ", @xmath20 grows rapidly with increasing @xmath15 because the potential well narrows . to a first approximation the strain energy grows quadratically with @xmath15.@xcite hence , decreasing the range destabilizes strained structures .    from the above analysis",
    "we can see that minimization of the potential energy involves a balance between maximizing @xmath19 and minimizing @xmath20 .",
    "the interior atoms of the three morphologies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fid ] ) all have twelve nearest neighbours , and so differences in @xmath19 arise from surface effects .",
    "the optimal shape for each morphology results from the balance between maximizing the proportion of @xmath28 faces ( an atom in a @xmath28 face is 9-coordinate , but in a @xmath29 face only 8-coordinate ) and minimizing the fraction of atoms in the surface layer . as mackay icosahedra ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fid](b ) ) have only @xmath28 faces and are approximately spherical , the icosahedra have the largest @xmath19 .",
    "complete mackay icosahedra occur at @xmath30 a pentagonal bipyramid has only @xmath28 faces , but because it is not very spherical more stable decahedral forms are obtained by truncating the structure parallel to the five - fold axis to reveal five @xmath29 faces and then introducing re - entrant @xmath28 faces between adjacent @xmath29 faces .",
    "the resulting structure is called a marks decahedron ( fig .  [",
    "fig : fid](c ) ) and was first predicted by the use of a modified wulff construction.@xcite decahedra generally have lower values of @xmath19 than icosahedra because of the @xmath29 faces .",
    "the tetrahedron and octahedron are fcc structures that have only @xmath28 faces , but they are not very spherical .",
    "the optimal fcc structure is the truncated octahedron with regular hexagonal faces ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fid](a ) ) . at larger sizes than those considered in this study ,",
    "the optimal structure involves further facetting , so that it more closely approximates the wulff polyhedron.@xcite of the three morphologies fcc structures have the smallest values of @xmath19 .",
    "-5 mm -5 mm    [ fig : gaps ]    a mackay icosahedron can be decomposed into twenty fcc tetrahedra , but as we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : gaps](b ) , when twenty regular tetrahedra are packed around a common vertex large gaps remain . to bridge these gaps the tetrahedra have to be distorted , thus introducing strain .",
    "the distance between adjacent vertices of the icosahedron is 5% larger than the distance between a vertex and the centre .",
    "similarly , a pentagonal bipyramid can be decomposed into five fcc tetrahedra sharing a common edge .",
    "again , a gap remains if regular tetrahedra are used ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gaps](a ) ) and consequently decahedral structures are strained , although not as much as icosahedra .",
    "in contrast , close - packed structures can be unstrained .    having deduced the relative values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 for icosahedral , decahedral and fcc structures",
    ", we can predict the effect of the range on the competition between them . for a",
    "moderately long - ranged potential , the strain associated with the icosahedron can be accommodated without too large an energetic penalty and so such structures are the most stable . as the range of the potential",
    "is decreased , the strain energy associated with icosahedra increases rapidly , and there comes a point where decahedra become more stable .",
    "similarly , for a sufficiently short - ranged potential fcc structures become more stable than decahedral structures .",
    "the above decomposition of the potential energy also helps us to understand the effect of size on the energetic competition between the three morphologies . the differences in @xmath19 , which arise from the different surface structures , are approximately proportional to the surface area ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the strain energies , however , are proportional to the volume ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "therefore , the differences in @xmath20 increase more rapidly with size than the differences in @xmath19 , thus explaining the change in the most stable morphology from icosahedral to decahedral to fcc with increasing size .",
    "the effect of increasing the size is similar to the effect of decreasing the range of the potential : both destabilize strained structures .",
    "the principal method that we have used to generate candidate structures for the global minima makes use of the physical insight gained from the last section .",
    "we have simply attempted to construct geometries that maximize @xmath19 for the three ordered morphologies.@xcite the resulting structures were then optimized by either conjugate gradient@xcite or eigenvector - following@xcite methods .",
    "a similar approach was successfully used by northby to generate low energy icosahedra for lj clusters.@xcite the effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by how few of northby s lowest energy structures have been superseded and by the length of time that it has taken to find these exceptions.@xcite our approach , however , depends on the imagination of the practitioner to conceive of all the possible ways that a structure with a large value of @xmath19 could be obtained . furthermore",
    ", this method will always fail to find the global minimum if the latter is not based on one of the ordered structures , as is the case for the larger clusters we have considered at low values of @xmath15 .    to complement the above approach two global optimization techniques",
    "were used to try to find structures that might have been missed .",
    "firstly , we used a method in which eigenvector - following is employed to take steps directly between minima on the pes.@xcite if low temperature metropolis monte carlo is used in this space of minima , the system will walk down to the bottom of a basin containing many minima .",
    "this technique avoids the difficulties associated with trapping in local minima that can occur for methods which take steps directly in configuration space .",
    "secondly , we used a ` basin hopping ' approach , which has proved to be effective for lj clusters;@xcite it is the only unbiased global optimization method to have found the global minima that are marks decahedra . for morse clusters it was able to find all the lowest energy minima at @xmath15=3 , 6 , 10 and all but twelve at @xmath15=14 ; this included some structures that were lower than any of those we had constructed . the fact that we found most of the minima both by unbiased global optimization and by construction makes us confident that our lowest energy structures are truly global minima .",
    "the results for the basin - hopping algorithm are impressive because the global optimization task for morse clusters is a difficult one .",
    "the size of the configuration space for the larger clusters is compounded for short - ranged potentials by the nature of the pes .",
    "firstly , the pes becomes more rugged as the range is decreased.@xcite the physical reason for the larger number of minima at short range is the loss of accessible configuration space as the potential wells become narrower , producing barriers where there are none at long range .",
    "stillinger and stillinger@xcite and bytheway and kepert@xcite both found that minimizations performed from random starting configurations are much less likely to find the global minimum for a short - ranged potential .",
    "similarly , barrier heights are also likely to become higher and rearrangements more localized for a shorter - ranged potential .",
    "these trends have been observed in comparisons of the rearrangements of 55-particle  and lj clusters.@xcite hence the range of the potential is likely to have a significant impact on the dynamics , making escape from local minima much more difficult .",
    "this effect has been observed by rose and berry who have shown that the rate at which the ground state structure of a potassium chloride cluster is found upon cooling can be significantly decreased by using a shielded coulomb potential to reduce the range of the interactions.@xcite    furthermore , as a result of the competition between the decahedral and the various types of close - packed structures for short - ranged potentials , it is more likely that there are a number of low energy minima which are very close in energy but are structurally dissimilar .",
    "each of these minima lie at the bottom of their own funnel on the pes .",
    "this multiple funnel topography can lead to cases where optimization is extremely difficult because the free energy barriers for transitions between the funnels can be large , thus leading to trapping .",
    "the worst cases are when relaxation down the pes preferentially takes the system into a funnel which does not end at the global minimum,@xcite and when the global minimum only becomes the state with the lowest free energy at low temperatures.@xcite    finally , fcc and decahedral minima are more structurally dissimilar from minima typical of the liquid - like state than the icosahedral structures .",
    "therefore , the paths from the liquid to these structures are likely to be fewer and longer than those leading to the icosahedral structures,@xcite and so relaxation down the pes from the liquid - like state to fcc and decahedral global minima is harder .    for a number of reasons",
    "morse clusters are an ideal system with which to test global optimization methods designed for configurational problems .",
    "firstly , in this paper we provide very good estimates for the energies of the global minima .",
    "secondly , this system represents a much more general  the global minima have a variety of structural types  and tougher examination than is provided by lj clusters , a much - used test system for global optimization algorithms.@xcite and finally , the results for our basin - hopping algorithm provide a benchmark that any would - be global optimization method should try to beat .    2",
    "all the global minima that we have found are catalogued in table 1 along with their energies , point groups , number of nearest neighbours , strain energies and the values of @xmath15 for which they are probably the lowest energy minimum .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] which provides a zero temperature ` phase diagram ' , showing how the global minimum depends upon @xmath3 and @xmath15 .",
    "the structural behaviour of morse clusters with fewer than eight atoms is rather uninteresting because the global minimum is independent of @xmath15 . for all @xmath33 , however , the global minimum changes at least once as a function of @xmath15 . for @xmath34 ,",
    "icosahedral , decahedral and fcc structures all exist , and the form of the phase diagram is in good agreement with the predictions we made earlier based upon the decomposition of the potential energy .",
    "for most sizes the structure changes from icosahedral to decahedral to close - packed as the range of the potential is decreased . for @xmath35",
    ", however , the transition from decahedral to close - packed occurs at larger values of @xmath15 than we consider in this study .",
    "there are also a number of sizes ( @xmath3=3840 , 52 , 53 , 59 and 61 ) for which there is a transition directly from an icosahedral to a close - packed structure ; this occurs when @xmath19 for the lowest energy close - packed structure is greater than or equal to that for the lowest energy decahedron .",
    "[ fig : d2e ]    the boundaries between the different morphologies are sensitive functions of @xmath3 .",
    "such size dependence is observed for many properties of clusters , and gradually lessens as @xmath3 increases ( because the addition of a single atom becomes a smaller perturbation ) until the bulk limit is reached .",
    "the decahedral to close - packed boundary is particularly sensitive , because the range of @xmath15 for which the decahedron is most stable changes dramatically even when the difference in @xmath19 between the decahedral and close - packed structures changes by one .",
    "sizes for which a morphology is the lowest in energy for a particularly large range of @xmath15 indicate that the structure is especially stable .",
    "the optimal geometries shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fid ] are good examples .",
    "another indicator of special stability is provided by @xmath36 .",
    "peaks in @xmath37 have been found to correlate well with the magic numbers ( sizes at which clusters are particularly abundant ) observed in mass spectra.@xcite plots of @xmath38 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : d2e ] for a number of values of @xmath15 .",
    "unsurprisingly , the plot for @xmath15=6 is very similar to that for lj clusters with peaks due to especially stable icosahedral clusters . at higher values of @xmath15 peaks corresponding to close - packed and",
    "decahedral clusters begin to occur .",
    "the plot at @xmath15=14 is very similar to that recently obtained for   clusters using the girifalco intermolecular potential.@xcite if the energy is normalized by subtracting a suitable function of @xmath3 , particularly stable sizes again stand out ( fig .",
    "[ fig : comp ] ) .",
    "[ fig : comp ]    in the following subsections we will look at the growth sequences for each morphology in more detail .",
    "we also examine the unusual structures that occur for the larger clusters at low @xmath15 , which , as we will see , involve a mixture of order and disorder .",
    "many small clusters are polytetrahedral in the sense that the whole of the cluster can be divided into tetrahedra .",
    "this category includes the 13-atom icosahedron , which can be decomposed into twenty tetrahedra sharing a common vertex .",
    "addition of atoms to the icosahedron can occur in two ways and the two types of overlayer that result are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : over ] . one growth mode ( fcc - like ) continues the fcc packing of the twenty strained tetrahedra making up the icosahedron , and leads to the 55-atom mackay icosahedron ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fid](b ) ) .",
    "this scheme introduces octahedral interstices , and so the resulting structures are no longer polytetrahedral .",
    "the other anti - mackay ( hcp - like ) growth mode involves sites which are hcp with respect to the tetrahedra . for growth on the 13-atom icosahedron ,",
    "this overlayer preserves polytetrahedral character .",
    "each of the vertices of the original icosahedron becomes icosahedrally coordinated , and the structure that results from the completion of this overlayer , 45a , is a rhombic tricontahedron ; it is an icosahedron of interpenetrating icosahedra .",
    "interestingly , the rhombic tricontahedron is the face - dual of the truncated icosahedron made famous by ; indeed , it is even a particularly stable shell for the coverage of a  molecule by alkaline earth metal atoms.@xcite in previous studies , the anti - mackay overlayer has been referred to as the polyicosahedral@xcite or the face - capping overlayer.@xcite such names are reasonable for growth on the 13-atom icosahedron , but are confusing for growth on larger mackay icosahedra .",
    "[ fig : over ]    the icosahedral structures with an anti - mackay overlayer are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : icos.am ] and those with a mackay overlayer in fig .",
    "[ fig : icos.m ] . growth from the 13-atom icosahedron begins in the anti - mackay positions , because these do not include any low - coordinate edge sites , thus giving a larger @xmath19 .",
    "however , at some critical size the mackay overlayer becomes lower in energy because of the larger strain energies associated with the anti - mackay overlayer .",
    "further growth then leads to the next mackay icosahedron .",
    "the size at which this change occurs depends on the range of the potential ; it is given by the dashed line of negative slope that divides the icosahedral region of the phase diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] ) .",
    "the crossover size increases with the range of the potential .    at @xmath16",

    "ab initio _ molecular dynamics calculations for lithium clusters,@xcite the anti - mackay overlayer is lowest in energy up to @xmath41 .",
    "similarly , polytetrahedral structures were observed in a tight - binding study of sodium clusters up to the largest size considered @xmath3=34 ( for which 34a was the most stable structure).@xcite these effects are nicely explained by the long range of alkali metal potentials .",

    "the most prominent peak in @xmath37 due to an anti - mackay structure occurs at @xmath3=71 for @xmath15=6 .",
    "this corresponds to an overlayer which completely covers the five faces surrounding a vertex of the underlying icosahedron .",

    "structure 69c has a vertex atom missing from the underlying mackay icosahedron like 38a .",

    "the first structure in this size range with a mackay overlayer is 78d .",
    "we expect that the crossover from an anti - mackay to a mackay overlayer will again shift to larger size as the range increases , but we have not investigated this prediction in the present work .",
    "there are also three icosahedral global minima , 69b , 70c and 71b , which do not fit neatly into either the mackay or anti - mackay category .",
    "their surface layers have a mackay - like character , but are not in correct alignment with the underlying icosahedron .",
    "the overlayer has been given a twist about one of the fivefold axis in order to collapse some of the half octahedra at the edge of the overlayer into trigonal bipyramids in a multiple diamond - square - diamond ( dsd ) process.@xcite in fact for at @xmath15=5 , the lowest energy mackay structure is a @xmath42 transition state corresponding to a multiple dsd rearrangement between two permutational isomers of 71b .",
    "[ fig : comp ] illustrates the variation of the icosahedral energies with size .",
    "the complete mackay icosahedra appear as narrow minima separated by broad maxima corresponding to structures with incomplete outer shells . at @xmath15=6",
    "it is only near the top of these maxima that fcc and decahedral structures begin to have similar energies , for example at @xmath3=38 and 75 .",
    "the decahedral global minima are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : deca3][fig : deca5 ] .",
    "the structures have been grouped according to the number of atoms along the fivefold axis of the pentagonal bipyramid upon which they are based , and the decahedral region of the structural phase diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] ) has also been subdivided on this basis .",
    "decahedral clusters grow by capping exposed @xmath29 faces and filling in the grooves produced by the re - entrant @xmath28 faces . as this process progresses the structure changes from prolate to approximately spherical to oblate .",
    "this cycle begins again when a prolate cluster with a longer decahedral axis becomes lower in energy than the oblate cluster ( e.g.  at @xmath43 and 54 ) .",
    "for the clusters based upon a pentagonal bipyramid with 5 atoms along the fivefold axis ( @xmath44 ) , the growth proceeds asymmetrically  the decahedral axis does not always pass through the center of the cluster .",
    "for example , for 54c the surface structure of the 75-atom marks decahedron is completed on one side of the cluster before atoms are added to the other .    2    [ fig : deca3 ]    deviations from this basic growth scheme occur for @xmath3=2130 ( fig .",

    "as this value of @xmath45 suggests , it is also the global minimum for .@xcite this stability is also indicated by the large peak in @xmath37 for @xmath15=10 and 14 .",
    "other particularly stable structures occur at @xmath3=64 and 71 ; these are fragments of 75c with 3 and 4 @xmath29 faces of the marks decahedron complete .",
    "decahedral structures have been regularly seen in supported metal clusters.@xcite however , it is only recently that further experimental evidence for the existence of marks decahedra has been found in studies of gold clusters passivated by alkylthiolates.@xcite whetten and coworkers were able to isolate fractions with narrow size distributions which corresponded to the 75- , 101- and 146-atom marks decahedra .",
    "it is significant to note that our previous paper on morse clusters@xcite foreshadowed this discovery by recognizing the especial stability of the 75-atom marks decahedron , thus again showing the utility of morse clusters as a model system .",
    "the close - packed global minima are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cp ] .",
    "they have a diverse range of structures : there are 4 minima that are fcc , 8 that are hcp and 46 that involve a mixture of stacking sequences and twin planes .",
    "the preference for close - packed structures with twin planes , even though at many of the sizes there are fcc isomers with the same number of nearest neighbours , occurs for the same reason that bulk hcp has a lower energy than fcc for pair potentials , namely a larger energetic contribution from next - nearest neighbours .",
    "the global minima are broadly based on five structures which are especially stable : the hcp 26c , the truncated octahedron 38d , the tetrahedral 59e and the ` twinned truncated octahedra ' 50d and 79f .",
    "the latter four give rise to peaks in @xmath38 at @xmath15=14 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : d2e ] ) .",
    "the 38-atom truncated octahedron , 38d , is the most stable fcc cluster in the size range we consider here .",
    "it becomes the global minimum at the lowest value of @xmath15 ( 4.76 ) of any of the close - packed structures .",
    "curiously , there are two ranges of @xmath15 for which it is the global minimum . at long range",
    ", @xmath21 represents a significant part of the total energy .",
    "the truncated octahedron is most stable for @xmath46 because it is approximately spherical and so has a larger value of @xmath21 than the more oblate icosahedral structure 38e . for shorter - ranged potentials , the contribution of @xmath21 diminishes and so 38e becomes the global minimum for @xmath47 because it has a larger @xmath19 .",
    "then for @xmath48 the truncated octahedron again becomes the global minimum because it has a lower strain energy than 38e .",
    "there is a growing body of experimental evidence for the importance of truncated octahedra .",
    "parks  have recently assigned this structure to ni@xmath49 by probing the cluster s chemical reactivity.@xcite exafs ( extended x - ray absorption fine structure ) spectra of small gold clusters have been interpreted in terms of the presence of truncated octahedral clusters , particularly the 38-atom truncated octahedron.@xcite gold clusters passivated by alkylthiolate molecules selectively form truncated octahedra , which can be isolated and formed into superlattices.@xcite this structure is also observed for ligated 38-atom platinum clusters.@xcite    structures 50d and 79f both have @xmath50 symmetry and a single twin plane passing through the structure .",
    "the two halves of the structure have the surface morphology of truncated octahedra .",
    "indeed 79f can be formed from the 79-atom truncated octahedron by rotation of one half of the structure by 60@xmath51 about an axis perpendicular to one of the @xmath28 planes .",
    "both structures have the same number of nearest neighbours and 79f is slightly lower in energy only because of the larger contribution from next - nearest neighbours that results from the twin plane .",
    "again there is recent experimental evidence for the stability of this type of structure for gold clusters,@xcite although at larger sizes ( @xmath3=225 and 459 ) than considered in this study .",
    "the closed - packed structures from @xmath3=5760 are based on 59e .",
    "this structure is a 31-atom truncated tetrahedron with the faces covered by four seven - atom hexagonal overlayers occupying hcp sites with respect to the underlying tetrahedron .",
    "the stability of 59e comes from the combination of its high proportion of @xmath28 faces and its spherical shape . if atoms are added to one of the grooves in 59e a decahedral - like axis results , indicating a possible path between decahedral and closed - packed clusters .",
    "-0.3 mm    2    it is worth noting that the cuboctahedron is not the lowest energy close - packed structure for @xmath3=55 .",
    "in fact , it has four fewer nearest neighbours than structure 55d .",
    "hence , when magic numbers occur at sizes corresponding to both complete mackay icosahedra and cuboctahedra@xcite ( @xmath3=13 , 55 , 147 , ... ) it is more likely that they are due to icosahedra .",
    "furthermore , one has to interpret with caution those studies which seek to find the relative stability of fcc and icosahedral structures by comparing cuboctahedra with mackay icosahedra@xcite because the cuboctahedra are likely to be suboptimal fcc structures .    although this conclusion does not simply carry over to clusters surrounded by ligand shells ",
    "the ligands could significantly modify the relative surface energies of @xmath28 and @xmath29 faces  it is interesting to note that a recent reinvestigation of clusters which were originally thought to be cuboctahedral 55-atom gold clusters@xcite seems to disprove this structural assignment.@xcite      in this subsection , we consider those structures which become the global minimum only at low values of @xmath15 . we have restricted our study to those clusters with @xmath52 , since we do not know of a case where longer - ranged potentials might be relevant .",
    "the low @xmath15 structures that we have found separate into two size ranges : those with @xmath3 around 13 and those with @xmath0 .",
    "the former set have been described in a previous paper,@xcite but we illustrate them again in fig . [",
    "fig : dis.small ] because the connection to kasper polyhedra@xcite was not originally identified and because they are important for understanding the structures that occur at larger @xmath3 .",
    "the majority of the structures associated with low @xmath15 are polytetrahedral : the entire cluster can be divided into tetrahedra with atoms at the vertices .",
    "these minima also tend to be close to spherical in shape and highly strained in order to maximize @xmath19 . as we noted earlier",
    ", the 13-atom icosahedron is polytetrahedral . in this case",
    ", each nearest - neighbour contact between the centre and a vertex is the common edge of five tetrahedra .",
    "this is also true of all the nearest - neighbour contacts in the rhombic tricontahedron ( 45a ) which do not lie on the surface .",
    "nearest - neighbour contacts which are surrounded by more or less than five tetrahedra are said to have defects called _ disclination lines _ running along the interatom vector .",
    "those contacts surrounded by more than five tetrahedra are termed negative disclinations ( if there are six it is a @xmath53 disclination , if there are seven a @xmath54 disclination ,  ) and those surrounded by fewer than five tetrahedra are termed positive disclinations ( if there are four it is a @xmath55 disclination and if there are three a @xmath56 disclination ) .",
    "most of the structures associated with low @xmath15 are polytetrahedral and involve disclinations .",
    "although packing five tetrahedra around a nearest - neighbour contact involves some strain , the energetic penalty associated with either more or less tetrahedra is greater .",
    "therefore , structures involving disclinations are only likely to be lowest in energy for long - ranged potentials where the associated strain can be most easily accommodated , and where they must have a larger @xmath19 than the alternative disclination - free structures .",
    "a @xmath53 disclination line involves less strain than a @xmath55 disclination line because of the gap that remains when five regular tetrahedra share a common edge ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gaps](a ) )",
    ". consequently , structures which involve only negative disclinations , or an excess of them , are more common amongst the low @xmath15 global minima .",
    "to visualize the network of disclination lines in a structure , one must first partition space according to the voronoi procedure , in which each point is assigned to the voronoi polyhedron of the atom to which it is closest .",
    "this allows nearest neighbours to be defined as those atoms whose voronoi polyhedra share a face .",
    "the delaunay network that results from joining all such nearest neighbours is the dual of the voronoi construction and divides all space into tetrahedra .",
    "this definition of a nearest neighbour has been termed geometric , rather than physical ( e.g.  using a cutoff distance ) , and the corresponding division of space into tetrahedra is artificial in the sense that it is independent of whether a polytetrahedral description is appropriate .    in practice",
    "we determined the voronoi polyhedra from the fact that a set of four atoms constitutes a delaunay tetrahedron if the sphere touching all four atoms contains no other atoms.@xcite the centre of this sphere is then a vertex of the voronoi polyhedron of each atom .",
    "as the number of tetrahedra around a nearest - neighbour contact is the same as the number of sides for the face common to the voronoi polyhedra of both nearest neighbours , disclination lines can then be assigned .",
    "however , problems can occur in assigning the delaunay network if there are more than four atoms exactly on the surface of the sphere .",
    "such a degeneracy , which only occurs as a result of symmetry , renders the analysis non - unique .",
    "this is the case for the 55-atom mackay icosahedron and for bulk close - packed solids because of the presence of octahedral interstices , but it is not a problem here since we only apply the method to clusters that are polytetrahedral in character .",
    "one further consideration is that the analysis should not be applied to nearest - neighbour contacts between the surface atoms of a cluster .",
    "the smallest global minimum that involves a disclination line is 11a where the central atom is surrounded by a 10-atom coordination shell .",
    "this encapsulation gives the structure a larger @xmath19 than the incomplete icosahedron ( structure 11b of ref .  ) , but results in a larger strain energy.@xcite the structure involves a single positive disclination line running through the centre of the cluster .",
    "similarly , for @xmath3=12 and 1416 , clusters with a single coordination shell become lower in energy than structures based on the icosahedron at long range .",
    "structures 11a , 12a , 14a , 15a , 16a and 17f ( the second lowest energy structure of at @xmath57 ) correspond to kasper polyhedra . of these structures",
    "15a is the most stable in terms of the range of @xmath15 for which it is the global minimum.@xcite the kasper polyhedra are the deltahedral coordination shells that involve the minimum number of disclinations .",
    "they are important in the frank - kasper phases,@xcite which are crystalline structures that are polytetrahedral and involve ordered arrays of negative disclination lines .",
    "much interest has been focussed on the frank - kasper phases because they are closely related to icosahedral quasicrystals.@xcite indeed a recent three - dimensional model of quasicrystalline structure was based upon clusters involving disclination lines similar to those we find here.@xcite    -4 mm    -1 mm    [ fig : dis.small ]    structures 11a , 12a , 14a , 15a and 16a are all deltahedral , and so growth can occur in both ` anti - mackay ' and ` mackay ' sites ( fig .  [",
    "fig : over ] ) .",
    "however , if one considers the addition of a hexagonal pyramidal cap to the most stable of the kasper polyhedra , 15a , the result is a @xmath58 structure with a positive disclination running the length of the symmetry axis ( a disclinated equivalent of the double icosahedron 19a ) which has only the same @xmath19 as the icosahedral structure 22a .",
    "disclinated polytetrahedra can not compete with the disclination - free polytetrahedral structures produced by an anti - mackay overlayer on the icosahedron . only once the latter growth sequence is completed at @xmath3=45 are structures with disclinations again global minima ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dis.large ] ) .",
    "the one exception is structure 38a , which is similar to the icosahedral structures 38b and 38c , but has two positive disclinations running through the structure in a strange double helical twist .",
    "interestingly , structures with anti - mackay growth on 11a have been recently observed for m@xmath59rg@xmath12 ( m  metal , rg  rare gas ) clusters where the metal ion is sufficiently small with respect to the rare gas atoms.@xcite the metal ion presumably lies in the centre of the cluster , and the size ratio ensures that the cluster is least strained when the metal ion is surrounded by 10 rare gas atoms .",
    "similarly , one might expect structures with negative disclinations to occur for ab@xmath12 clusters when a is sufficiently large with respect to b that a coordination number of larger than twelve is favoured for the a atom .",
    "the most stable disclinated polytetrahedral structures occur at @xmath3=53 , 57 , and 61 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : d2e](a ) ) .",
    "these are the sizes for which complete ` anti - mackay ' overlayers on 15a , 16a and 17f are possible .",
    "the effect of the overlayers is to extend the disclination lines emanating from the central atom . in these structures ,",
    "those interior atoms not lying on a disclination line are icosahedrally coordinated .",
    "many other minima are related to these stable structures : 51a and 52a are based on 53a but with missing vertex atoms ; similarly , 59b and 60a are based on 61a ; and 70a and 74a are based on 57a and 61a , respectively , but with an additional 13-atom cap which extends one of the ` arms ' of the disclination network . furthermore , many of the other structures include parts of the disclination networks of 53a , 57a and 61a , but combined with a more disordered array of disclinations in another part of the cluster .",
    "other interesting structures are also seen .",
    "47a , 50a and 59a seem to have a mixture of mackay and anti - mackay overlayers .",
    "64a is formed from the rhombic tricontahedron 45a by the extension of the structure along a three - fold axis and the addition of a ring of atoms in the centre . in the middle of 64a",
    "is the @xmath60 structure 20d ( the third lowest energy structure for at @xmath15=3 ) which can be regarded as two highly strained interpenetrating icosahedra .",
    "however , for the larger clusters it becomes difficult to recognize any structural motifs , and some just seem to be disordered tangles of disclinations .",
    "the above results are particularly interesting because of their relevance to our understanding of liquid structure .",
    "the minima described above , when reoptimized at larger values of @xmath15 , correlate with structures which lie in the lower energy range of the band of minima associated with liquid - like clusters.@xcite this is because simple liquids have significant polytetrahedral character,@xcite as has been shown by the success of the dense random packing of hard spheres@xcite as a model for metallic glasses@xcite and later by computer simulations.@xcite indeed , nelson has suggested that simple liquids are polytetrahedral packings that are characterized by a disordered arrangement of disclination lines.@xcite consequently , by examining the global minima associated with low @xmath15 we can study the size evolution of polytetrahedral packings , and the development of bulk liquid structure .",
    "-0.7 mm    2 at small sizes disclination - free polytetrahedra based on icosahedra with anti - mackay overlayers are possible ; at larger sizes polytetrahedra with ordered arrangements of disclinations are most common , and finally at the largest sizes in this study the polytetrahedra have a disordered disclination network .",
    "the latter geometries are structurally very similar to fragments of bulk liquid , except that the density of disclination lines is lower.@xcite    theoretical studies of sodium clusters have shown that amorphous structures are lower in energy than regular geometries up to at least 340 atoms , the largest size considered in that study.@xcite the present results suggest that the these disordered structures are due to the relatively long range of the sodium interatomic potential .",
    "amorphous structure for sodium is also suggested by the experimental observation of electronic shells@xcite and supershells,@xcite which are incompatible with any of the ordered morphologies one might expect.@xcite indeed , the transition from electronic to geometric magic numbers which occurs at about 1000 atoms@xcite probably reflects a change in the lowest energy structures from amorphous minima to mackay icosahedra , which can be explained by the twin effects of the size and the range of the potential.@xcite    since most minima associated with small values of @xmath15 do not have a common lattice or packing scheme , it is difficult to predict the low energy structures , and so most have been found by one of the global optimization methods",
    ". fortunately , these methods are most likely to succeed for long range potentials because the corresponding pes s are smoother and support fewer minima than for shorter range .",
    "another consequence of the lack of lattice structure is that the differentiation between nearest neighbours and next - nearest neighbours becomes ambiguous and the decomposition of eqn .",
    "( 2 ) more arbitrary . for these clusters we chose to define @xmath19 using a cutoff at @xmath15=4 which corresponds to the distance",
    "at which the pair energy is @xmath61 .",
    "in this paper we have attempted to find the global minima for morse clusters as a function of @xmath15 and the number of atoms .",
    "the global potential energy minimum represents the equilibrium structure at zero kelvin , but to predict the structure at non - zero temperatures we must consider the free energy , and the effect of other low energy minima .",
    "this can be done by summing the density of states over all the relevant minima.@xcite an illustration of this approach for understanding the structure of morse clusters has been given previously,@xcite revealing that for at @xmath15=6 , the equilibrium structure changed from decahedral to icosahedral at very low temperature . this transition is simply a consequence of the larger entropy for the icosahedral region of configuration space ",
    "there are far more low energy icosahedral minima .",
    "this effect is likely to be general . at the magic numbers for a morphology",
    "the entropy will be low because there is a single unique low entropy structure and a large gap to other isomers with the same morphology .",
    "therefore the finite temperature equivalent of the structural phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] is likely to show weakened magic number effects and so have smoother boundaries between the different morphologies .",
    "furthermore , the energy gap between the lowest energy ordered minimum and the liquid - like band of minima increases as the range becomes shorter , and hence the melting temperature increases with @xmath15.@xcite therefore the region of the phase diagram where disordered polytetrahedral structures have the lowest free energy is likely to spread up from the bottom as the temperature increases .    in this paper",
    "we have considered only isotropic pairwise additive interactions .",
    "as noble gas clusters and clusters of  molecules can be reasonably modelled by such potentials we would expect the structures we have found at the appropriate values of @xmath15 to be similar to the actual structures of these clusters .",
    "our results lead us to predict that neutral clusters of  molecules exhibit decahedral and fcc structures at small sizes because of the short range of the intermolecular potential .",
    "this basic conclusion has been confirmed in studies using more realistic potentials.@xcite    in contrast , making predictions for metal clusters is problematic because the range of the potential is only one factor determining the structure and many - body terms , in particular , may also be important.@xcite these terms may affect the relative surface energies of @xmath28 and @xmath29 faces , and so alter the energetic competition between icosahedral , decahedral and fcc structures.@xcite for example , in a study of lead clusters cuboctahedra are always found to be lower in energy than icosahedra because the surface energies of @xmath28 and @xmath29 faces are nearly equal.@xcite    nevertheless our results are of value to the field of metal cluster structure .",
    "firstly , they enable particularly stable structural forms to be identified .",
    "for example , in our previous paper on morse clusters we identified the 38-atom octahedron and the 75-atom marks decahedron as particularly stable .",
    "subsequently , they have both been observed experimentally;@xcite it even being possible to isolate fractions of the latter when passivated by surfactants .",
    "this correspondence between the morse structures and those of real systems encourages us to believe that some of the general principles that determine stability in our simple model system do carry over to real clusters .",
    "secondly , the morse structural database should be useful in providing candidate structures for comparison with the indirect structural information yielded by experiments on size - selected clusters .",
    "finally , the database can also provide plausible starting structures for theoretical studies with more realistic , but computationally expensive , descriptions of the interactions ; this expense would prevent the type of extensive searches that have been performed in this paper .",
    "indeed , we have used the database in this way in studies of metal clusters modelled by the sutton - chen family of potentials@xcite and clusters of  molecules.@xcite for these reasons , the coordinates for all the global minima given in this and previous papers@xcite will be made available on the world - wide - web.@xcite",
    "we have shown how the range of an isotropic pairwise additive potential determines the structure of atomic clusters . in particular , we have identified four principal structural regimes . for long - ranged potentials at sizes @xmath6218 and @xmath0 the global minima are generally polytetrahedral and can be analyzed in terms of disclination lines . for the smaller clusters",
    "the disclinations form ordered arrangements and the structures are fragments of bulk frank - kasper phases . as the size increases it becomes more likely that the disclination network is a disordered tangle ; these global minima have amorphous structures similar to those exhibited by liquid - like clusters . at intermediate ranges of the potential icosahedra",
    "are dominant .",
    "as the range decreases , first decahedral and then fcc structures become lowest in energy .",
