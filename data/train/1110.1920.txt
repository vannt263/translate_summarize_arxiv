    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is an extension to the standard model ( sm ) that predicts an additional symmetry between bosons and fermions .",
    "this results in several advantages over the sm , such as the introduction of a dark matter candidate , a solution to the hierarchy problem and a potential for gut scale unification . the minimal supersymmetric standard model , mssm ,  @xcite is the simplest version of a susy theory .",
    "it predicts , after symmetry breaking , five higgs bosons of which three are neutral , these are denoted @xmath1 . at tree level",
    "the higgs sector of the mssm can be described by two parameters , which are chosen to be tan@xmath2 , the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets , and @xmath3 , the mass of the pseudo - scalar higgs boson . in the mssm the coupling of the neutral higgs to down - type quarks and leptons",
    "is enhanced by a factor of tan@xmath2 and the corresponding coupling to the up - type quarks and leptons is suppressed .",
    "this means that decay modes to bottom quarks and tau leptons are of specific interest , with a predicted decay rate of around 90% to bottom quarks and 10% to tau leptons . at large values of tan@xmath2 two of the three neutral higgs bosons",
    "are approximately degenerate in mass which leads to an approximate doubling of the production cross section . beyond tree level ,",
    "radiative corrections bring in dependance on more than just @xmath3 and tan@xmath2 .",
    "therefore , limits are set for specific benchmark regimes in the @xmath3 , tan@xmath2 plane . for regions of the parameter space with low values of @xmath3 and large values of tan@xmath2",
    "the tevatron can set strong limits that complement the previous searches by the lep experiments  @xcite .",
    "the combined results in the di - tau final state from both d0 and cdf are presented using up to 2.2 fb@xmath4 and 1.8 fb@xmath4 of integrated luminosity , respectively .",
    "the searches are described in  @xcite and detailed information on the d0 and cdf detectors is available in  @xcite .",
    "the cdf analysis studied three final states , where either one tau decays leptonically to a electron or muon and one hadronically or both decay leptonically , @xmath5 and @xmath6 . at d0 a 1.0 fb@xmath4 analysis of these three final states was combined with an additional 1.2 fb@xmath4 analysis that studied just the @xmath7 final state .",

    "electrons are identified through their characteristic energy deposits in the calorimeter and are required to be isolated and have a reconstructed track matching this energy deposit deposition in the calorimeter . for reconstructed muon objects ,",
    "hits in the muon chambers are matched to tracks in the central tracking chambers .",

    "d0 and cdf have different tools to identify hadronic decays of taus . at cdf narrow",
    "isolated clusters in the calorimeter with either one or three tracks are identified and a variable cone algorithm is used to reconstruct these with strict isolation requirements in order to suppress quark and gluon jets .",
    "hadronic tau decays at d0 are first split into three types , based on the energy clusters in the calorimeters and the number of tracks .",
    "type 1 and 2 are 1-prong decays with energy deposited in the hadronic calorimeter ( type 1 ) or in both the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters ( type 2 ) .",
    "type 3 taus are 3-prong decays with an invariant mass below 1.7 gev and energy deposits in the calorimeters . for each of the different types a neural network , nn ,",
    "is trained , using @xmath8 decays as signal and multijet events predicted from data as background , to separate hadronic tau decays from jets .",

    "the determination on the multijet background has a large uncertainty of 10 - 40% .",
    "additional dominant shape uncertainties come from the jet energy scale determination and the @xmath43-tagging efficiency modeling .",
    "apart from the uncertainties on the multijet production and the hadronic tau reconstruction efficiency all these uncertainties are taken to be 100% correlated across the tau types .    in the case of @xmath45",
    "only shape systematics are considered .",
    "the dominant background arises from the measurement of the rate at which light partons fake heavy flavor jets and the @xmath43 tagging efficiency .",
    "in contrast , for the signal the dominant sources of uncertainness are the jet energy scale and the @xmath43 tagging efficiency . between the two analyses only the @xmath43 tagging efficiency and the jet modeling systematics are correlated and are taken to be 100% correlated .",
    "limits are set using the modified frequentist or cl@xmath73 technique  @xcite , with more details on this available in  @xcite .",
    "this is done both within the the framework of the mssm at the benchmark points as described in section 2.4 and in a less model independent way on the cross section @xmath74 branching ratio .",
    "this is not normally possible when combining channels with different production modes or final states , as the relative signal yields in each channel will generally depend on the specific model being studied .",
    "but as the two channels share a production mode , and the higgs width is narrower than the experiment resolution for the majority of the interesting phase space , model independent limits can be derived .",
    "the only additional assumption that must be made is that the higgs boson only decays to tau leptons and @xmath43 quarks .",
    "this model independent limit can be seen in figure 5 , for 3 choices of the tau branching ratio , br = 6% , 10% , 14% .",
    "for masses up to around 180 gev , the @xmath44 channel tends to dominate , beyond this value the @xmath75 becomes increasingly important as can be seem from the decrease in the dependence of the limits on the tau branching fraction at higher values .      in figure 6 the limits",
    "are set in the @xmath39 and no mixing scenarios as described in section 2.4 , for a positive value of tan@xmath2 .",
    "the experimental uncertainties an additional 15% uncertainly on the production cross section is included .",
    "this has contributions from the scale variations and the pdf uncertainties .",
    "the sm cross section of the @xmath76 process as taken from mcfm where feynhiggs is used to calculate the branching fraction so that the sm cross section can be corrected to the appropriate @xmath32 @xmath74 br .",
    "for large values of tan@xmath2 the width of the higgs boson is comparable to the experiment resolution , this effect is taken into account using the method described in  @xcite .",
