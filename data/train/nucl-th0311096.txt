    "information on the electromagnetic properties of the nucleon resonances are necessary for constructing the dynamical quark model of baryons .",
    "photoproduction of pions on nucleons and nuclei remains a primary source of such information . on the other hand , because of a variety of @xmath22 and @xmath23 resonances excited in the pion production , it is rather difficult to extract unambiguously their properties from the measured observables .",
    "contrary to the pions , the @xmath0-photoproduction @xmath24 involves only the @xmath22 resonances with isospin @xmath25 , which make it possible to separate their contribution from the nearby @xmath23 resonances ( @xmath26 ) , appearing in the reactions with pions .",
    "it should also be noted that in spite of the common resemblance of process ( [ 10 ] ) to the pion photoproduction on a nucleon , there is a principle difference : whereas the @xmath27-meson consists of the @xmath28- and @xmath29-quarks , the @xmath0-meson includes also the strange quark - antiquark pair .",

    "varying the parameters of the resonances listed in table [ tab1 ] within the ranges recommended in ref.@xcite we obtain a good description of the data for @xmath95 . at the beginning also",
    "the relative phases @xmath97 ( see ref.@xcite ) were used in the fitting procedure , but after the eleven resonances and the background terms were included into the model , we were able to abandon these phase factors at all @xcite .",
    "the resulting set of parameters listed in table  [ tab1 ] @xcite was obtained by adjusting the model containing all eleven resonances and the background to the low energy data ( @xmath98 gev ) presented in ref.@xcite as well as to the old experimental results for @xmath99 gev obtained in @xcite .    as was repeatedly noted in the previous work ,",
    "the dominant contribution to the cross section of @xmath3 arises from the @xmath5 resonance , which is strongly coupled to the @xmath54 channel .",
    "however inclusion of this resonance alone does not reproduce energy dependence exhibited by the measured total cross section . only including @xmath6 , and damping by this means too a large contribution of @xmath5 resonance at the energies above 0.8 gev , we are able to bring the theory into agreement with the data which were obtained in two experiments in different energy regions ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "also the resonance @xmath9 provides within our model an essential contribution to the @xmath0 photoproduction amplitude .    using the parameters of @xmath5 from table  [ tab1 ] one obtains @xmath100 where @xmath101 denotes the total radiative width of the resonance .",

    "if one takes @xmath110 then @xmath111 0.38 @xmath112 and @xmath113 gev@xmath105 .",

    "were included into the fitting procedure , namely @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 . as the direct calculations shows , insertion of these resonances influences mostly the @xmath4 asymmetry , while the differential and total cross sections in the region @xmath116 gev are less affected .",
    "the most important contribution to @xmath117 comes from the @xmath15 resonance .",
    "the calculated angular distributions @xmath118 are in excellent agreement with the experimental results reported by mami ( mainz ) and graal ( grenoble ) up to the photon energy @xmath119 mev .",
    "they were discussed in our previous work @xcite and are not presented here . with increasing energy the theoretical distributions @xmath118 exhibit pronounced decrease at forward angles",

    "some results around the energy @xmath120 gev , which were obtained in the present as well as in the previous work @xcite are compared with the data in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "it must be emphasized that the model including eleven @xcite resonances agrees with the experimental results at these energies as good as the low energy model @xcite with six resonances .",
    "furthermore , we would like to note that the maxima in @xmath121 for @xmath122 mev appear at the same angles @xmath123 as does the maxima of @xmath118 at the corresponding energies .",
    "this is the reason why the experimental values of @xmath124 increase strongly at the energy around @xmath120 gev ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "the target asymmetry @xmath125 ( [ 40 ] ) predicted by the model is positive .",
    "furthermore , it depends almost not at all on the born ( nucleon pole ) term , as well as on the form factors in the @xmath94 vertices and agrees qualitatively with the bonn results @xcite , as is shown in fig.[fig3 ] . in the same figure",
    "we also demonstrate the sensitivity of @xmath125 to the contribution of the @xmath9 and @xmath11 resonances .",
    "it must also be noted , that the model of @xcite ( the result is shown by the doted curve ) was in disagreement with the experimental results . at the same time",
    ", we could not describe the experimental data of work @xcite on the target asymmetry of process ( 1 ) for the photon lab energy below 750 mev by using the resonances from table 1 .",
    "finally , the polarization of the final protons @xmath126 ( [ 50 ] ) is in strong disagreement with the experimental data obtained 30 years ago @xcite .",
    "if the background contribution is not included , the integrated cross section decreases rapidly to zero .",
    "therefore , a pure resonance model for @xmath3 seems to be incompatible with a real production dynamics .",
    "as was noted above , the background contains the nucleon pole term in @xmath18 and @xmath28 channels as well as @xmath20 and @xmath21 exchanges in @xmath17 channel .",
    "the nucleon pole term is defined by the @xmath83 coupling constant .",
    "its contribution appears to be insignificant for all reasonable values of @xmath82 , therefore we take @xmath127 from ref.@xcite .",
    "for pointlike @xmath94 vertices with @xmath128 the @xmath20 and @xmath21 contributions rise rapidly with increasing photon energy so that for the photon energies above @xmath129 gev the photoproduction amplitude is almost totally determined by the vector meson exchange , and the cross section is anomalously enhanced in the region close to @xmath1 gev .",
    "taking into account a finite range of the @xmath94 coupling ( @xmath130 if @xmath131 ) leads to visible damping of the cross section(see fig.[fig4 ] ) .",
    "however , its value depends strongly on the choice of the @xmath94 form factors . in the present work we have considered two types of form factors @xmath132 with @xmath133 ( monopole type @xcite ) and @xmath134 ( dipole type @xcite ) with different cut off parameters @xmath135 . whereas the constants @xmath91 in eq.([vmeson ] ) are quite well known from the radiation decays @xmath136 , ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the hadronic constants @xmath137 and @xmath138 are determined poorly for both @xmath20 and @xmath21 mesons , and are usually treated as free parameters in phenomenological models .",
    "several sets of these constants , used in the previous work , are listed in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "appreciable difference between the total cross section obtained with these sets appears only above the energy @xmath139 gev ( see fig.[fig4 ] ) .",
    "it must be kept in mind that all but the latter sets given in table  [ tab2 ] were used for the description of @xmath108 observations only in the low - energy region ( @xmath98 gev ) .",
    "in the previous work @xcite we have extended the model to higher energies ( @xmath99 gev ) using the old database from @xcite , since the experimental results obtained at jlab @xcite for @xmath141 gev were published later .",
    "the data @xcite agree with those published in @xcite at @xmath142 gev but above this energy region one notes a visible deviation ( fig5 ) . our model with eleven resonances",
    "does not reproduce the results of @xcite . the same deviation",
    "can also be observed by comparing the data with other analyzes , e.g @xcite . in order to eliminate this disagreement",
    "we have introduced into the model , apart from two @xmath140 resonances with masses 1535 and 1650 mev , the third @xmath140 resonance with the parameters given in table  [ tab1 ] ( marked by asterisk ) .",
    "varying the ratio @xmath115 in the region 0.5 to 0.01 one obtains for the invariant helicity amplitude of the third @xmath140 resonance the @xmath109 = 0.021 to 0.151 gev@xmath105 , appreciably smaller than the corresponding values of other two @xmath18-wave resonances .",
    "the effect of including the @xmath7 resonance into the model of ref.@xcite is shown in fig.[fig6 ] .",
    "the contribution vanishes totally at the ends of the interval @xmath143 gev , as is seen in figs .",
    "6a and 6d , which in turn guarantees that a quite good description of the data achieved in the low - energy region within the model with eleven resonances is not affected by insertion of the new resonance .",
    "there are appreciable differences between the differential cross sections at forward and backward @xmath0 angles predicted by various models @xcite . therefore to discriminate between the models , measurements of the @xmath0 angular distribution at small ( @xmath144 ) and large angles ( @xmath145 )",
    "became important .",
    "the main distinctive property of the present model is , that it takes explicitly into account the contribution of higher resonances with large angular momenta , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , which make the angular distribution of @xmath108 at @xmath146 gev strongly anisotropic ( fig.[fig6 ] ) . in this connection",
    "we take with some caution the estimation of the total cross section made by the authors of ref.@xcite who has used only the values of @xmath118 in the interval @xmath147 . as is noted above",
    ", such estimation must depend strongly on the model used for the extrapolation of the cross section into the region of small and large @xmath0 angles .",
    "the dependencies of the angular distributions of the @xmath0 mesons in process ( 1 ) for energy region @xmath146 gev on contributions of higher - spin resonances are shown in fig.[fig7 ] .",
    "the differential cross section form depends significantly on contributions of the resonances @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "the influence of the contribution of the resonance @xmath16 on it is minor . in this energy region",
    "the calculations have shown that higher - spin resonances are responsible for the large positive @xmath4 beam asymmetry .",
    "the third @xmath18-wave resonance discussed here is not heuristic .",
    "this resonance was predicted by quark models and was also observed in other processes @xcite .",
    "its parameters , needed to describe the data ( see table [ tab1 ] ) are in surprisingly good agreement with those , extracted from the experimental results for the decay @xmath148 @xcite ( @xmath149 mev , @xmath150 mev ) , but do not agree with the properties of the third @xmath140 resonance predicted by the constituent quark model with broken @xmath151 symmetry @xcite ( @xmath152 mev , @xmath153 mev ) .",
    "while on the subject of the new @xmath140 resonances , we would like to note the work @xcite where a unified analysis of the data for the scattering and photoproduction of pions in a large energy region was performed . the results of the cited work point to the existence of the third and the forth @xmath140 resonances with masses @xmath154 mev and @xmath155 mev respectively .",
    "however , the corresponding widths can not be defined with such a precision and their values were estimated to be more than 300 mev . although the authors of ref.@xcite do not introduce additional @xmath18-wave resonance for the description of the @xmath3 cross section , they have to insert it when explaining the the data for @xmath156 .",
    "finally , the third @xmath140 resonance is predicted also in the hypercentric constituent quark model @xcite which gives @xmath157 mev . in conclusion ,",
    "the resonance @xmath140 which is needed for the description of the available data @xcite around @xmath158 mev has properties which agree quite well with the results obtained in the recent theoretical and experimental investigations .",
    "using our model with twelve resonances ( together with the third @xmath140 resonance ) , we have extended the calculation of the cross section for @xmath117 to higher photon energies .",
    "there are other theoretical predictions in the energy region above @xmath19 gev , from which we would like to note the ref.@xcite where the usual isobar model approach was supplemented by the regge model",
    ". however , the results provided by this hybrid model in the region @xmath159 gev are not in good agreement with the data . extending our model to the energy @xmath160 gev with background parameters from ref.@xcite",
    "we are faced again with unacceptable increase of the cross section above the energy @xmath161 gev caused by anomalously large contribution of the vector meson exchange .",
