    "interference studies in solid - state mesoscopic interferometers provide most valuable information about scattering properties of artificial atoms ( quantum dots).@xcite interference takes place between electronic partial waves traveling along a nonresonant channel ( the reference arm ) and through a quasi - localized state ( the quantum dot ) . when an external magnetic flux is piercing the area enclosed by the interferometer , the partial waves pick up different aharonov - bohm phases and conductance oscillations are observed .",
    "moreover , path interaction between the background channel and hopping through the dot gives rise to characteristic asymmetric fano transmission lineshapes.@xcite    for strongly interacting dots which are coupled to external reservoirs , transport at low temperatures is dominated by kondo correlations , which originate from a nontrivial antiferromagnetic interaction between the leads conduction electrons and the dot electron in a discrete level playing the role of a quantum impurity.@xcite such interaction leads to a screening of the impurity spin and the linear conductance reaches in the strong coupling regime the maximum value @xmath0 ( the unitary limit ) for a wide range of the gate voltage.@xcite however , when the dot is inserted in the arm of an aharonov - bohm interferometer , the linear - response curves evolve from the unitary limit to asymmetric lineshapes and finally to a plateau of zero conductance as the background transmission @xmath1 increases from 0 to 1.@xcite in addition , the differential conductance shows a zero - bias peak at @xmath2 which is transformed into a dip when @xmath1 approaches 1.@xcite    at the same time , spin - orbit interactions have been a subject of ongoing interest since the advent of spintronics.@xcite a prominent spin - orbit interaction is the rashba interaction , which arises in inversion asymmetric semiconductor heterostructures.@xcite aharonov - bohm oscillations have been observed in rings in the presence of spin - orbit interactions.@xcite when a dot subject to rashba interaction is embedded in the mesoscopic interferometer , the traveling electrons acquire a spin - dependent phase in addition to the aharonov - bohm phase.@xcite a similar effect takes place in quantum wires with localized rashba coupling,@xcite in which case localized magnetic states can be formed in nonequilibrium situations.@xcite for spin - orbit quantum - dot aharonov - bohm systems , the spin polarization can be controlled by tuning the magnetic flux and the rashba strength.@xcite more importantly , using numerical renormalization group methods it has been argued that a compensation effect takes place when an external zeeman field is applied , eliminating the splitting due to the spin - orbit interaction in the kondo local density of states.@xcite this situation is also seen in single dots coupled to ferromagnetic cases , for which spin dependent coupling leads to the splitting of the dot spectral weights@xcite via an effective field for gate voltages away from the particle - hole symmetric point.@xcite    the nature of the compensating field can be fully understood only through a scaling analysis .",
    "this is the goal we want to accomplish in the present work .",
    "we find that the origin of the effective field is twofold : ( i ) for noninteracting electrons the combination of spin - orbit interactions and external flux gives rise to a splitting of the dot energy levels ; and ( ii ) in the presence of interactions , described only beyond mean - field theory , the effective field acquires corrections which are of the same order as the noninteracting value in the case of very strong correlations .",
    "we find that the compensating field is a _ periodic _ function of the spin - orbit and the aharonov - bohm phases and that it is always nonzero _ independently _ of the gate voltage due to the breaking of the particle - hole symmetry point .",

    "<S> we consider a flux - threaded aharonov - bohm ring with an embedded quantum dot coupled to two normal leads . </S>",
    "<S> the local rashba spin - orbit interaction acting on the dot electrons leads to a spin - dependent phase factor in addition to the aharonov - bohm phase caused by the external flux . using the numerical renormalization group method </S>",
    "<S> , we find a splitting of the kondo resonance at the fermi level which can be compensated by an external magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> to fully understand the nature of this compensation effect , we perform a scaling analysis and derive an expression for the effective magnetic field . the analysis is based on a tight - binding model which leads to an effective anderson model with a spin - dependent density of states for the transformed lead states . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the effective field originates from the combined effect of rashba interaction and magnetic flux and that it contains important corrections due to electron - electron interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the compensating field is an oscillatory function of both the spin - orbit and the aharonov - bohm phases . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the effective field never vanishes due to the particle - hole symmetry breaking independently of the gate voltage . </S>"
