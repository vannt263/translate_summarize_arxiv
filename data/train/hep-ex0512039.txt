    "quantum chromodynamics , qcd , took foothold with the discovery of @xmath3 , the spin  triplet s  wave state @xmath4 of charmonium . despite 25 years of extensive work in charmonium spectroscopy by slac and desy in @xmath5 annihilation and fermilab in @xmath6 annihilation",
    ", several nagging problems remained unsolved . among the most important were problems related to spin ",
    "singlet states and two  photon widths of @xmath7 states .",
    "neither the @xmath5 or @xmath6 experiments were able to identify the s- and",
    "p - wave singlet states @xmath0 and @xmath1 . these states are obviously extremely important for understanding the spin ",
    "spin hyperfine interaction of @xmath8 .",
    "the two  photon widths of @xmath7 states @xmath9 are important for understanding relativistic and radiative effects in charmonia , because in the lowest order they are pure qed widths , akin to those of positronium levels .",
    "unfortunately , results from different measuring techniques have remained very divergent for about twenty years .    in this talk , i am going to address both of these problems .",
    "after 25 years of failed efforts to identify it , @xmath0 was finally identified by belle , babar , and cleo .",
    "cleo @xcite measured @xmath11 mev , which determines @xmath12 mev .",
    "this is an unexpected and extremely interesting result , considering that @xmath13 mev , and most theoretical predictions had @xmath14 mev .",
    "the unexpectedly small hyperfine splitting observed for 2s states makes it more interesting than ever to look deeper into the hyperfine splitting of other charmonia , in particular the 1p states .",
    "if the confinement potential is lorentz scalar , there is no long  range spin ",
    "spin interaction in @xmath8 .",
    "it follows that for all other waves ( @xmath15 hyperfine splitting is zero , so that @xmath16 . to test this prediction",
    "it is necessary to identify @xmath1 and measure @xmath17 with precision .    in 1992",
    "fermilab e760 studied the reaction @xmath18 and claimed the observation of a signal for @xmath19 .",
    "however , higher luminosity runs by fermilab e835 @xcite in 1996 and 2000 failed to confirm this observation .",
    "fermilab e835 has also searched for @xmath19 in their 1996/2000 data in the reaction @xmath20 they report @xmath21 , with 13 observed events and a significance of the @xmath19 signal at @xmath22 level . at cleo",
    "@xcite we have now firmly identified @xmath19 with a significance of @xmath23 .    at cleo data",
    "were taken at @xmath24 , with 3.08 million @xmath24 .",
    "these data have been analyzed for @xcite @xmath25 both inclusive and exclusive analyses were done , and an accurate determination of @xmath19 mass was made in recoils against @xmath26 s whose energy could be measured with precision .",
    "* inclusive analyses : * two independent analyses were made , one in which the photon energy @xmath27 was constrained , and the other in which @xmath28 was constrained .",
    "completely consistent results were obtained .    * exclusive analysis : * in this analysis , instead of constraining @xmath27 or @xmath28 , seven known decay channels of @xmath29 were measured . once again , consistent results were obtained .",
    "the overall result is @xmath30 or @xmath31    two conclusions follow from these results : ( a ) the simple pqcd expectation is not strongly violated , ( b ) the magnitude and sign of @xmath32 is not yet well determined .",
    ", in ( left ) inclusive analysis ( right ) exclusive analysis @xcite.,width=211 ]",
    "there are two different ways of measuring the two  photon width of @xmath34 . in @xmath5 collisions ,",
    "the @xmath34 state is formed in two  photon fusion , @xmath35 , and a subsequent decay of @xmath34 ( usually @xmath36 ) is measured .",
    "these measurements , including the latest one from belle @xcite , yield @xmath37 ev . in @xmath6 annihilation ,",
    "the @xmath34 state is directly formed and its decay into two  photons is measured . in these fermilab measurements",
    "@xcite , @xmath38 ev is determined .",
    "it is this persistent and long - standing large discrepancy which motivated us to make the present measurement at cleo @xcite using 14.4 fb@xmath39 of @xmath5 data taken in the upsilon region to study the two  photon fusion reaction @xmath40    the spectrum of photon mass , @xmath41 , in fig .",
    "3 shows clear peaks corresponding to the e1 photon from @xmath36 .",
    "fits to these peaks leads to @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ev for @xmath5 , @xmath45 , and ( @xmath46 ) , respectively , using @xmath47 as measured recently by cleo @xcite .       in making a comparison of the present results with other recent results ,",
    "it was noted that the differences originated from using an old ( pdg1990 ) value for @xmath48 which was nearly 40% smaller than the result of the new cleo measurement @xcite . when the results of the belle and e835 measurements are reevaluated using the cleo value of @xmath48 , it is found that all results become completely consistent .    since the two gluon decay width of @xmath34 , @xmath49 mev , our measurement of @xmath2 allows us to estimate the strong coupling constant @xmath50 . according to pqcd , @xmath51 .",
    "this leads to @xmath52 . if first order radiative corrections",
    "are included , we obtain @xmath53 ."
