    "quantum resonances play an important role in theoretical description and intuitive understanding of physical processes taking place in the microscopic world of molecules , atoms , nuclei , and various nano - systems .",
    "this is why locating the corresponding spectral points @xmath1 , i.e. determining the resonance parameters , @xmath2 ( resonance energy ) and @xmath3 ( resonance width ) , is an indispensable part of any theoretical modelling as well as of an analysis of scattering data .",
    "+ from the theoretical point of view , the resonances , being complex - valued eigen - energies of the hamiltonian , are not easy to locate . for each angular momentum",
    ", they appear as regular strings on the so called non - physical sheet of the complex energy surface ( see , for example , ref .",
    "the influence of these resonances on the corresponding partial - wave cross section depends not only on their distribution over the energy surface but also on the corresponding @xmath0-matrix residues  @xcite .",
    "+ the analysis of scattering data , i.e. phenomenological extraction of resonance parameters , is perhaps even more difficult than their theoretical determination . indeed , a measured cross section is the sum of all partial - wave cross sections , where the effects of all possible resonances add together . therefore the sharp structures corresponding to individual resonances , may overlap and smear out their discrete character .",
    "such an overlap very often happens even with resonances belonging to the same partial wave .",
    "+ in a phenomenological search for resonances , the first step usually consists in performing the so called phase - shift analysis  @xcite , i.e. in obtaining numerical values of the partial - wave phase shifts or the corresponding reaction amplitudes , for a set of collision energies .",
    "then the amplitudes known on the real axis , are analytically continued onto the complex - energy riemann surface , where the resonances are identified as their singularities .",
    "various methods differ in the way such an analytic continuation is done  @xcite .",
    "+ the basic idea underlying the majority of existing approaches of this type , consists in fitting the experimental points with curves obtained from a phenomenological scattering amplitude , where possible resonance poles are artificially embedded by hand and their complex energies serve as the fitting parameters .",
    "the most simple of such approaches is the breit - wigner parametrization  @xcite .",
    "another version of the same approach is based on the fano parametrization  @xcite , where the amplitude is split in the resonant and background parts , which makes it more realistic and allows one to treat more complicated `` zigzags '' of the cross section . in nuclear and particle physics ,",
    "the resonances are usually introduced into the fitting procedure via a model propagator with explicit singularities at complex energies ( unitary isobar model )  @xcite .",
    "+ many authors emphasize ( see , for example , chapter 6 of the book @xcite and references therein as well as a more recent publication @xcite ) that for a reliable analytic continuation of the scattering amplitude ( or @xmath0-matrix ) it is very important to construct its phenomenological expression preserving proper analytic structure , i.e. its branching points , various symmetries etc .",
    "this can easily be achieved for the single - channel problems and with some effort for two - channel ones ( dalitz - tuan representation )  @xcite . however , when the number of channels is three or more , constructing the @xmath0-matrix with correct branching at all the thresholds becomes extremely difficult within the traditional approaches  @xcite .",
    "+ in the present paper , we resolved this difficulty . for obtaining the @xmath0-matrix",
    ", we use the structure of the jost matrix derived in our early publications  @xcite , where all the factors responsible for the branching are given analytically for an arbitrary number of channels .",
    "this enables us to perform the analytic continuation and the search for resonances in a model - independent way , i.e. without embedding the resonance poles by hand .",
    "consider an @xmath4-channel collision process that can symbolically be written as a chemical or nuclear reaction , @xmath5 with two - body systems in both the initial and final states .",
    "we assume that the interaction forces for these systems are of a short - range type , i.e. they vanish at large distances ( @xmath6 ) faster than the coulomb force .",
    "the wave function describing such a process at the collision energy @xmath7 is a column matrix , @xmath8 where each of the @xmath4 lines corresponds to a separate channel .",
    "the channels are characterized not only by the type of the particles ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , etc . ) but also by the complete sets of the corresponding quantum numbers ( such as the threshold energy , angular momentum , spin , etc . ) . in other words , any two states of the system that differ by at least one quantum number are considered as different channels even if the type of the particles and the threshold energies are the same .",
    "this means that a channel state has a definite value of the angular momentum and thus its angular dependence can be factorized as @xmath11 the set of radial wave functions @xmath12 obey the coupled system of radial schrdinger equations , @xmath13      u_{n}(e,{r } )      =      \\frac{2\\mu_n}{\\hbar^2 }      \\sum_{n'=1}^nv_{nn'}(r)u_{n'}(e,{r})\\ , \\ ] ] where the coupling is due to the off - diagonal elements of the interaction - potential matrix @xmath14 . in eq .",
    "( [ mult_chan_shreq ] ) , the channel momentum , @xmath15 is determined by the difference between the total energy @xmath7 and the channel threshold @xmath16 , as well as by the reduced mass @xmath17 in the channel @xmath18 . +",
    "each of the @xmath4 equations of the set ( [ mult_chan_shreq ] ) is of the second order . in the theory of differential equations ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) it is shown that such a set has @xmath19 linearly independent solutions , i.e. @xmath19 linearly independent columns that form a basis in the solution space , and only half of these columns are regular at @xmath20 .",
    "the regular columns can be combined in a square matrix @xmath21 , which is called the fundamental matrix of regular solutions . since",
    "a physical wave function must be regular , it is a linear combination of the columns of the matrix @xmath21 .",
    "+ when the particles move away from each other ( @xmath6 ) , the potential matrix tends to zero and thus the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ mult_chan_shreq ] ) vanishes .",

    "@xmath22      u_{n}(e,{r } )      \\approx 0\\ ,      \\qquad r\\to\\infty\\ , \\ ] ] has @xmath19 linearly independent column - solutions .",
    "these @xmath19 columns can be combined in two diagonal square matrices , @xmath23 @xmath24 that involve the riccati - hankel functions @xmath25 and represent the _ in_-coming and _ out_-going spherical waves in all @xmath4 channels .",
    "+ the @xmath19 columns of the matrices ( [ inwaves ] ) and ( [ outwaves ] ) constitute a basis in the solution space at large distances and thus each column of the fundamental matrix @xmath21 is their linear combination when @xmath6 .",
    "this can be written as @xmath26 where the combination coefficients are combined in the square matrices @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "they are functions of the energy and are called the jost matrices .",
    "+ the @xmath0-matrix that completely determines all the scattering observables , is expressed via the jost matrices ( the details can be found , for example , in the textbook @xcite or in the papers @xcite ) , @xmath29^{-1}\\ .\\ ] ] the resonances are those spectral points @xmath30 on the riemann surface of the energy , where @xmath31 the energy surface has a square - root branching point at every channel threshold @xmath16 .",
    "this is because the jost matrices depend on the energy @xmath7 via the channel momenta ( [ chmom ] ) and for each of them there are two possible choices of the sign in front of the square root .",
    "the resonance spectral points are located on the so called non - physical sheet of this riemann surface , i.e. such a layer of the surface where all the channel momenta have negative imaginary parts . in the numerical calculations ,",
    "the choice of the sheet is done by an appropriate choice of the signs in front of the square roots ( [ chmom ] ) .",
    "in the present paper , our main goal is to find a way of a reliable parametrization of experimental data , such that it would allow us to locate the resonance spectral points at complex energies .",
    "as we described in the previous section , the multi - channel @xmath0-matrix has very complicated energy dependence via the channel momenta and therefore is defined on a riemann surface with an intricate connection of many layers .",
    "this means that a straightforward parametrization of such a matrix using an arbitrarily chosen functional form may give erroneous results . when choosing the parametrization form , it is important to take into account as much information on the symmetry properties and analytic structure of the @xmath0-matrix as possible .",
