    "in hubble s ( 1936 ) classification scheme for galaxies , lenticular ( s0 ) galaxies first appear as a transitional class between the ellipticals and the two branches ( barred and unbarred ) of the spirals , and , despite much evidence to the contrary , it has often been assumed that the hubble ` fork ' describes an evolutionary scheme .",
    "for instance , this assumption informs the popular idea that collisions of proto - disks in the early universe lead to the formation of elliptical galaxies or that quenching of star formation in field spirals as they fall into dense regions leads , by a variety of mechanisms , to their transformation into s0 galaxies .",
    "this process , first proposed by larson , tinsley & caldwell ( 1980 ) , has been invoked to account for the morphology - density relation of dressler ( 1980 ) and the apparent blueing of the galaxy population in distant clusters ( butcher & oemler 1984 ) , and has stimulated considerable theoretical activity ( see pimbblet 2003 for a review ) .",
    "such processes modify the star formation history of the disk by removing the supplies of gas necessary to fuel further star formation .",
    "a sensitive test of this mechanism would therefore involve a comparison of the stellar populations of bulges and disks for elliptical , s0 and spiral galaxies .",
    "while the stellar content of galaxies can not be resolved except for some of the nearest objects , the radial distributions of their stellar populations may be examined by means of colour gradients .",
    "it has long been known that early - type galaxies exhibit negative colour gradients , in the sense of being bluer at larger radii ( franx , illingworth & heckman 1989 , peletier et  al .",

    "these gradients have been conventionally interpreted as representing gradients in mean metal abundance , as most local ellipticals also exhibit such gradients in the strength of metal absorption lines ( baum , thomsen & morgan 1986 , carollo , danziger & buson 1993 , davies , sadler & peletier 1993 ) . however , this intepretation is vitiated by the existence of a strong degeneracy between age and metallicity in broadband colours as well as in most spectrophotometric indices ( worthey 1996 ) .",
    "nevertheless , colour gradients have considerable potential for constraining the history of star formation in distant galaxies , and for providing clues to their formation and evolution history .",
    "one approach to breaking the age ",
    "metallicity degeneracy is to consider the evolution of colour gradients .",
    "this experiment has been attempted in a few distant clusters with rich populations of early - type galaxies .",
    "saglia et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) , tamura & ohta ( 2000 ) and la barbera et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) have observed galaxies in clusters at @xmath6 and studied the evolution of their colour gradients , concluding that the most likely explanation consists of a mild metal abundance gradient within a passively evolving stellar population formed at very high redshift .    however , because of the relatively limited number of galaxies and relatively poor resolution at these redshifts , even with hubble space telescope ( hst ) imaging , saglia et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , tamura & ohta ( 2000 ) and la barbera et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have not examined the dependence of colour gradients on galaxy luminosities and morphology and whether the disk and bulge components of galaxies have different gradients , and therefore different stellar populations .",
    "it is therefore useful to consider a somewhat lower - redshift target , where the galaxy population can be probed over a wider range of luminosities and where the higher spatial resolution ( because of the lower distance ) and smaller cosmological dimming allow more detailed studies of colour gradient evolution than has been possible ( cf .",
    "tamura & ohta 2003 for a similar approach to the @xmath7 cluster abell 2199 ) .    in this paper",
    "we discuss a study of colour gradients in the @xmath8 cluster abell 2218 from deep archival hst multicolour data .",
    "we describe the data and the analysis in the following section and present the main results . we discuss these results in the light of models of galaxy formation and ,",
    "particularly , disk evolution .",
    "we adopt the concordance cosmological model with @xmath9 , @xmath10 and h@xmath11kms@xmath12mpc@xmath12 .",
    "the data consist of three archival images of the core of abell 2218 taken by the hst with the wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) through filters f450w , f606w and f814w ( pid : 8500 ; pi : fruchter ) . for simplicity",
    ", we will refer to these bands as @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 in the remainder of this paper ( we use prime symbols to distinguish the bands from the actual johnson bands and to avoid confusion in the subsequent discussion ) .",
    "the total exposure times were 12000s , 10000s and 12000s respectively , with individual exposures being 1000s each .",
    "these images were retrieved as fully processed associations from the hst archive ( micol , bristow & pirenne 1997 ) .",
    "a more detailed description of this dataset is given by smail et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) .    we have selected a sample of 24 galaxies morphologically classified as e or s0 and spectroscopically confirmed to be cluster members ( this information is taken from smail et  al .  2001 ) .",
    "first , the mean sky was removed from the images using the iraf task sky . for each galaxy",
    "we then derived surface brightness profiles using the iraf task ellipse ( jedrzejewski 1987 , busko 1996 ) , using @xmath16 ( 1-pixel ) sampling and 3@xmath17 clipping to remove overlapping stars and galaxies .",
    "as our main interest in these data is to derive colour gradients , we forced the isophotes in @xmath14 and @xmath15 to be evaluated at the same radius ( measured along the semi - major axis ) as in the @xmath13 image ( which is the one with the lowest signal to noise ) by using the ` inellip ' option in ellipse .",
    "the isophote centres were left free to be recentered for each image , to avoid the effect of minor misalignments between the hst images in the different bands .    in some cases ,",
    "galaxies lie in the envelope of other bright galaxies or overlap with nearby galaxies ( especially the two giant ellipticals but also in a few other cases ) . in these cases",
    ", we have modelled the ` contaminating ' object using the iraf task bmodel and removed it from the image .",
    "we then computed new isophotes for the galaxies . in most cases",
    ", this appears to make no difference , at least to the level of producing colour gradients different by more than the statistical and systematic errors .",
    "however , galaxies # 292 and # 298 appear to be significantly affected by the envelopes ( and , in the case of # 292 proximity to the edge of the detector ) of their neighbouring galaxies . because of this we decided to exclude these two galaxies from our analysis . in other cases , such as # 205 and # 634 , modelling shows that the profiles are not being affected by proximity to a bright neighbour and that ellipse has appropriately removed the contaminating object from the profile ..    for each data point , two sources of error contribute ; using the terminology of saglia et al .",
    "( 2000 ) these are : a statistical error , which is the uncertainty , returned by ellipse in measuring the mean flux along each isophote and a systematic error , reflecting the uncertainty in measuring and subtracting the mean sky level .",
    "we estimated this latter component in the following way : for each of the individual 1000s exposures in each band , we calculate the mean sky using sky .",
    "this yields 12 , 10 and 12 sky estimates in @xmath13,@xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the error in the mean sky is then computed by jackknife resampling of these sky estimates .",
    "we calibrate the data on to the vega system , using the zeropoints provided by holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . at each isophote semi - major radius",
    "we then compute the resulting colour as a function of radius .",
    "we measured the point spread function using non - saturated stars in our images .",
    "there are , unfortunately , only a few such stars but the full width at half maximum appears to be a consistent @xmath18 in all bands , suggesting that differences in the point spread function do not affect the derivation of colour gradients .",
    "inspection of the surface brightness profiles in figure 1 , shows some deviation from the profile expected for a de vaucouleurs profile in the inner two or three points .",
    "for this reason , we decide to fit to the points with @xmath19 in order to avoid any residual effects due to small differences in the point spread function .",
    "the colour gradients are then derived by fitting the data ( colour vs. logarithm of the radius measured along the semi - major axis ) with a weighted linear least squares regression , where the weights are the statistical errors of the colours ( added in quadrature ) .",
    "the fits are carried out to either the radius at which the quadratic sum of statistical and systematic errors exceeds 10% or to the radius at which ellipse stopped integrating the surface brightness profile ( even if the errors are smaller than 10% ) .",
    "we also estimate the colour gradient only over the range defined by our worst colour ( @xmath20 ) , for consistency .",
    "the statistical error on the fit slope and intercept is derived from the error in the fit to the data , while the systematic error is determined by carrying out a new fit to the data points , after adding and subtracting the @xmath21 error in the sky level .",
    "figure  1 shows the surface brightness profiles in all three filters and the colour gradients in @xmath22 and @xmath23 , plotted against @xmath24 , for all 22 galaxies .",
    "the surface brightness profiles and colour profiles are plotted over the range @xmath25 to the largest radius used in fitting the colour gradients . as for points interior to @xmath26 , which are not used in fitting ,",
    "some galaxies show colours consistent with the extrapolated fits , while in some other cases it is possible that the galaxies contain ` cores ' with flatter colours . however , this is difficult to ascertain without data at better resolution .",
    "the major contribution to the error budget comes , not unexpectedly , from the @xmath13 band , where the wfpc2 camera is less efficient and the galaxies are fainter ( as it corresponds to the rest - frame @xmath27 ) . we tabulate the results in table  1 .",
    "this shows , in column order , the galaxy i d , morphology and @xmath28 band luminosity ( from smail et  al .",
    "2001 ) , the @xmath29 colour gradient with its statistical and systematic error , and the and @xmath30 colour gradient with its statistical and systematic error ( derived as described above ) .",
    "the mean gradients are @xmath31 for es and @xmath32 for s0s and @xmath33 for es and @xmath34 for s0s .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
