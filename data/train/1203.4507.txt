    "the ising model , and several of its generalizations , have been of central importance in the development of the theory of phase transitions and the formulation of the universality hypothesis  @xcite . according to this hypothesis all critical systems with the same dimensionality , the same symmetry of the ordered phase , and the same number of order parameters",
    "are expected to share the same set of critical exponents . for the 2d ising model (",
    "square and some other lattices ) all critical exponents are known exactly  @xcite .",
    "these exponents are expected to be obeyed by the ising model on all two - dimensional ( 2d ) lattices and also by all other models , which according to the above hypothesis are expected to belong to the same universality class .    in several cases ,",
    "this expectation has been verified either by exact analytic solutions  @xcite , or , with impressive accuracy  @xcite , using monte carlo ( mc ) simulations and the theory of finite - size scaling ( fss )  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the issue of explicit finite - size expansion of the main thermodynamic functions , or their accurate numerical estimation , has been considered in several cases and is of substantial significance .",
    "often this provides a tool to improve accuracy of the mc estimation of critical exponents , especially in cases complicated by the presence of logarithmic corrections  @xcite . in particular",
    ", the studies of critical amplitudes of the specific heat expansions  @xcite and the studies of universal and non - universal features of certain combinations of critical amplitudes of the order parameter  @xcite are very interesting topics .",
    "one of the well - known generalizations of the ising model is the @xmath1 model studied in this paper . here , we will present a careful mc study verifying , with high accuracy , the universality hypothesis of the two models , and we will also report results related to the logarithmic expansions of the specific heat , for two different 2d lattices known as archimedean lattices . our motivation is also to test a recent mc study  @xcite , that erroneously resulted in an attempt to define and estimate effective dimensionality for the @xmath1 model on these lattices .",
    "an archimedean lattice is a graph of a regular tiling of the plane whose all corners are equivalent and are shared by the same set of polygons .",
    "thus , we may denote each archimedean lattice by a set of integers ( @xmath2 ) indicating , in cyclic order , the polygons meeting at a given vertex . as an example , the square lattice is the archimedean lattice denoted by ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "there exists eleven 2d archimedean lattices .",
    "in addition , they have dual lattices , three of which are archimedean , the other eight are entitled laves lattices  @xcite . suding and ziff presented precise thresholds for site percolation on eight archimedean lattices determined by the hull - walk gradient - percolation simulation method  @xcite .",
    "rigorous bounds for the bond percolation critical probability are determined for three archimedean lattices by wierman  @xcite .",
    "in addition , scullard and ziff showed that the exact determination of the bond percolation threshold for the martini lattice can be used to provide approximations to the kagome and ( @xmath4 ) lattices  @xcite .",
    "as illustrated by suding and ziff , the archimedean lattices can be transformed to a square array of @xmath5 vertices and then apply periodic boundary conditions . for the computer simulation of the two models studied in this paper , we also apply periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) and use their representation as illustrated in fig . 3 of their paper  @xcite .",

    "they claimed that the ising @xmath10 model on ( @xmath7 ) and ( @xmath6 ) al exhibits a second - order phase transition with critical exponents which do not fall into universality class of the square lattice ising @xmath0 model .",

    "this is carried out by observing the fss behavior of several finite size anomalies of the al systems .",
    "furthermore , the finite size scaling behavior at the accurately estimated critical temperatures is discussed . in the conclusions , summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] , we comment on previous observations concerning the critical behavior of the @xmath1 model on these lattices .",
    "the ( zero - field ) ising model is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath12 with spin variables @xmath13 taking on the values @xmath14 , or @xmath15 . as usual",
    "@xmath16 indicates summation over all nearest - neighbor pairs of sites , and @xmath17 for ferromagnetic exchange interaction . there is a variety of possible generalizations of the ising model .",
    "keeping only nearest - neighbor interactions one can generalize to a @xmath1 model including up to five interaction constants  @xcite .",
    "this is a rich model describing several phase transitions , critical and multicritical phenomena with a wide range of physical applications .",
    "special cases of this most general model are the well known and extensively studied blume - capel ( bc ) model  @xcite and also the blume - emery - griffiths ( beg ) model  @xcite . for our purposes , it suffices to introduce only the above mentioned generalization known as the bc model  @xcite .",
    "it is defined by introducing spin variables @xmath13 that take on the values @xmath18 , or @xmath15 , and a crystal field coupling @xmath19 , so that the hamiltonian is given by @xmath20    this model is of particular importance for the theory of phase transitions and critical phenomena , since as is well known its phase diagram consists of a segment of continuous ising - like transitions at high temperatures and for low values of the crystal field which ends at a tricritical point , where it is joined with a second segment of first - order transitions between ( @xmath21 ) and ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the bc model has been analyzed , besides the original mean - field theory  @xcite , by a variety of approximations and numerical approaches , in both 2d and 3d .",
    "these include the real space renormalization group  @xcite , mc simulations  @xcite , and mc renormalization - group calculations  @xcite , @xmath23-expansion renormalization groups  @xcite , high- and low - temperature series calculations  @xcite , a phenomenological fss analysis using a strip geometry  @xcite , and mc simulations  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the 2d ( mainly the square bc model ) has been extensively studied and there is no doubt today that the continuous ising - like transitions , along its second - order segment , obey the same critical properties with the 2d ising model .",
    "recently , a similar universality has been shown for its random - bond version  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 model , studied in this paper , is the 2d bc model at zero crystal field and therefore it belongs to the same universality class with the 2d ising model . of course",
    ", this universality should be expected to hold also for all archimedean lattices .",
    "it is well known that the accuracy of mc data may be decisive for a successful fss estimation of critical properties . over the years",
    ", the numerical estimation of critical exponents has been a non - trivial exercise , even for the simpler models , such as the ising model .",
    "an importance sampling approach , close to a second - order phase transition , requires appropriate use of cluster algorithms that can efficiently overcome the well known effects of critical slowing down .",
    "wolff - type algorithms  @xcite are easy to implement and very efficient close to the critical point .",
    "the wolff algorithm will be implemented , in the present paper , to simulate both the ising and the @xmath1 model . however , for the @xmath1 model the wolff algorithm can not be used alone , because wolff steps act only on the non - zero spin values .",
    "a suggested practice is now a hybrid algorithm along the lines followed by ref .  @xcite . since , we wanted to use a unified code for both models the hybrid approach was tested and implemented for both models . an elementary monte carlo step of this scheme consist of a number of wolff steps ( typically 5 wolff - steps ) followed by a metropolis sweep of the lattice . the combination with the metropolis lattice sweep is dictated by the fact that the wolff steps act only on the non - zero spin values .    thus , we have simulated both the ising model and the @xmath1 model on the two als by implementing the same hybrid approach described above . for the ising model case ,",
    "we carried out simulations only at the exactly known critical temperatures  @xcite , whereas for the @xmath1 model we generated mc data to cover several finite - size anomalies . in this case , the hybrid approach was carried over to a certain temperature range depending on the lattice size .",
    "furthermore , for this case , we found it convenient and of comparable accuracy to implement a parallel tempering ( pt ) protocol , based on temperature sequences corresponding to an exchange rate 0.5 .",
    "this pt approach is very close to the practice suggested recently in  @xcite .",
    "the temperature sequences were generated by short preliminary runs . using such runs and a simple histogram method  @xcite ,",
    "the energy probability density functions can be obtained and from these the appropriate sequences of temperatures can be easily determined  @xcite .",
    "the superiority of the hybrid approach , over a simple metropolis scheme  @xcite , is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "this figure is constructed by using moving averages for the order parameter ( @xmath24 ) close to the corresponding critical temperatures for both the ising model ( denoted in the panel as i m ) and the @xmath1 model ( denoted in the panel as bc ) on the same ( 3,4,6,4 ) al of linear size @xmath25 and @xmath5 vertices . as can be seen , from this illustration",
    ", the metropolis algorithm suffers from very strong fluctuations .",
    "it follows a very slow approach to equilibrium and only with the help of heavy sampling ( the dashed lines give the average over 20 independent metropolis runs ) its results are of reasonable accuracy . on the other hand",
    ", the hybrid approach converges very fast to equilibrium and produces accurate results even in only one single run . here",
    "it should be noted that , both the simple hybrid approach and its combination with parallel tempering ( in a convenient temperature range ) give in 20 independent runs the same results ( with comparable accuracy ) and these are indicated by the continuous straight lines in the panel of fig .",

    "furthermore , the behavior of the crossing temperatures of the 4th - order binder cumulants  @xcite , and their asymptotic trend , has been observed and utilized for a safe estimation of the critical temperatures .",

    "an alternative estimation of this exponent is obtained from the behavior of the maxima of the logarithmic derivatives of the powers @xmath27 of the order parameter with respect to the inverse temperature , since these scale as @xmath32 with the system size  @xcite .",
    "if the exponent @xmath31 has been estimated , then the behavior of the values of the peaks corresponding to the absolute order - parameter derivative , which scale as @xmath33 with the system size  @xcite , gives one route for the estimation of the exponent ratio @xmath34 .",
    "further , knowing the exact critical temperatures , or very good estimates of them , we can utilize the behavior of the order parameter at the critical temperatures for the traditional and effective estimation of the exponent ratio @xmath34 .",

    "<S> the ising model @xmath0 and the @xmath1 model are studied by efficient monte carlo schemes on the ( 3,4,6,4 ) and the ( 3,3,3,3,6 ) archimedean lattices . </S>",
    "<S> the algorithms used , a hybrid metropolis - wolff algorithm and a parallel tempering protocol , are briefly described and compared with the simple metropolis algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> accurate monte carlo data are produced at the exact critical temperatures of the ising model for these lattices . </S>",
    "<S> their finite - size analysis provide , with high accuracy , all critical exponents which , as expected , are the same with the well known 2d ising model exact values . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed finite - size scaling analysis of our monte carlo data for the @xmath1 model on the same lattices provides very clear evidence that this model obeys , also very well , the 2d ising model critical exponents . as a result , we find that recent monte carlo simulations and attempts to define effective dimensionality for the @xmath1 model on these lattices are misleading . </S>",
    "<S> accurate estimates are obtained for the critical amplitudes of the logarithmic expansions of the specific heat for both models on the two archimedean lattices . </S>"
