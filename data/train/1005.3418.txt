    "in the past twenty five years studies of nucleus - nucleus collisions over a very broad range of energies have been performed .",
    "the goal was , and still is , to learn more about the properties of hot and dense nuclear matter , namely its equation of state ( eos ) and transport coefficients such as viscosity and thermal conductivity . in the energy range ( 0.1 to @xmath6 gev ) of the schwerionen synchrotron ( sis )",
    "accelerator located at gsi , darmstadt , one expects from simple - minded hydrodynamic considerations that densities twice to three times saturation density are reached .",
    "another important characteristic of this energy range is that the compressed overlap zone created in the collision expands at a rate comparable to the rate at which the accelerated nuclei interpenetrate , a phenomenon that provides a very useful clock : the passage time @xmath7 where r is the nuclear radius , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the incoming nucleon s c.m . momentum and mass . in a historic paper",
    "@xcite a strong ejection of matter in the _ transverse _ direction to the beam was predicted . in the present work on very central collisions , this transverse direction , in particular in comparison to the longitudinal ( beam ) direction ,",
    "will play a crucial role .",
    "the discovery @xcite of collective flow seemed to confirm that fluid dynamics was the proper language to theoretically accompany the experimental efforts .",
    "however , soon after it became clear that a quantitative extraction of fundamental properties of nuclear matter required the development of microscopic transport theories @xcite that did not have to rely on the local equilibrium postulate needed to apply the ( one - fluid ) hydrodynamic approach @xcite .",
    "immediately it also became then clear that the static eos was not the only unknown as momentum dependent potentials @xcite and in - medium modifications of hadron masses @xcite and cross sections @xcite came into play .",
    "despite of these increased difficulties the past decade has witnessed reasonably successful attempts to come to a first - generation of nuclear eos using experimental observations in heavy ion collisions as constraints @xcite .",
    "one approach , @xcite , choose to base its conclusions on azimuthally asymmetric flow measurements for the au+au system ( reviewed in @xcite ) done at the bevalac and ags accelerators ( usa ) , while the other approach @xcite was based on a comparison of kaon production in c+c and au+au collisions using primarily data obtained at sis by the kaos collaboration ( @xcite , for a review see @xcite ) .    despite this encouraging progress",
    "a critical look at the present situation reveals that more work is necessary .",
    "fundamental conclusions based on one particular observable , such as the @xmath10 production varying the system size @xcite or centrality @xcite , are not sufficiently convincing to settle the problem . at sis energies kaons are a rare probe : besides the condition that their production in a dense medium must be under sufficient theoretical control , one must also assume that the change of environment , i.e. the bulk matter produced , is correctly described .",
    "this involves a complete mastery of the degree of stopping reached in the collisions , since the idea @xcite behind the kaon observable is that it is ( in the subthreshold regime ) sensitive to the achieved density .",
    "further , the possible influence of isospin dependences has to be accounted for : the switch from the iso - symmetric system @xmath11c+@xmath11c to the asymmetric @xmath5au+@xmath5au is expected to produce a shift of the ratio of the isospin pair @xmath12 , but the @xmath13 production was not measured .",
    "on the other hand , eos determinations based on reproducing flow data are also not straightforward as has become clear from a number of earlier works by our collaboration @xcite and the eos collaboration @xcite .",
    "estimates using rankine - hugoniot - taub shock equations @xcite , ( that ignore geometrical constraints and non - equilibrium , as well as momentum - dependent phenomena ) , show that the pressures generated in the collisions , which are at the origin of the measured flow observables , differ only relatively modestly when the assumed stiffness of the cold ( zero temperature ) eos is varied , leading already in 1981 the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite to conclude _ that high accuracy of flow and entropy measurements would be needed to deduce information on the cold eos_. in this connection it is interesting to note that a promising new observable has been proposed @xcite suggesting to use azimuthal dependences of the kinetic energies , rather than the yields of emitted particles .",
    "a disadvantage of the azimuthally asymmetric flow signal , is that it converges to zero for the most central collisions where compression is maximal .",
    "it is also a somewhat unsatisfactory situation , that in the past no clean isolation of the isospin dependence of the eos has been made : most of the conclusions based on heavy ion data involve the au+au system , which is neither isospin symmetric nor close to the composition of neutron matter ( or neutron stars ) .    in the present work ,",
    "devoted to _ bulk _ observations in very _ central _",
    "collisions , we set up a large data base of additional challenging constraints for microscopic transport simulations that claim to extract basic nuclear matter properties from heavy ion reactions . we shall show that sensitivity to the eos is not limited to rare probes or non - central collisions .",
    "one observable , the ratio of variances of transverse and longitudinal rapidities @xcite , that we shall loosely speaking call stopping , will catch our particular attention .",
    "developing further on the original idea @xcite , we shall show evidence that this ratio is influenced by the ratio of the speed of expansion and the speed at which the incoming material is progressing and in this sense the clock is not limited to non - central collisions . a first attempt to use simultaneously the stopping observable and the directed flow to constrain the eos",
    "was published in @xcite .",
    "another signal of the eos that we see is the degree of cooling following the decompression of the system : correlations between stopping , radial flow and clusterization serve as evidence that at least a partial memory of the original compression exists @xcite .",
    "cooling ( reabsorption for produced particles , clusterization for nucleonic matter ) can be more efficient if it was preceded by more compression ( softer eos ) .",
    "this has different , subtle , consequences for pion , kaon and nucleonic cluster yields at freeze out .",
    "it is well known by now that this kind of physics has overlap with some areas of astrophysics .",
    "the stiffness of the eos limits the density in the center of neutron stars as it does limit the maximum densities achievable in heavy ion reactions .",
    "the synthesis of nuclei during the expansion - cooling processes in the universe and more locally of supernovae is partially imitated in the expansion - cooling of the heavy - ion systems we observe .    with this exciting context in mind",
    "we have studied twenty five system - energies varying the incident energy by a factor twenty and choosing three , and for some incident energies more , different system sizes and compositions in an effort to elucidate the finite size and isospin effects on the observables : it is well known that nuclear ground state masses are heavily affected by direct ( surface ) and indirect ( coulomb and neutron - proton asymmetry ) contributions due to finite size : the correction to the bulk energy is by a factor two .",
    "nuclei are therefore truly small objects . in the case of nuclear reactions with incident energies",
    "not larger than the rest masses an added finite dimension comes to the nuclear surface : the finite time duration .",
    "there is no reason to expect then , that finite size effects are smaller in reaction physics than for ground state masses .",
    "data analyses , in particular thermal model analyses , that ignore this fact are likely to be misleading .",
    "relative to other earlier experimental studies we shall make a substantial effort to eliminate , or at least clarify , apparatus specific effects on the observables .",
    "first , the choice of the centrality selection is done in such a way that a precise matching of centralities between experiment and simulation is possible : this is important , as some bulk observables ( yields , stopping ) turn out to be very sensitive to centrality for good physical reasons .",
    "second , we try to make superfluous the use of apparatus filters when comparing data from experiment and simulation .",
    "a large effort is devoted to reconstruct the full @xmath14 data wherever this is possible with a reasonably low uncertainty .",
    "the large acceptance of our setup , the fopi apparatus @xcite , makes this possible .",
    "we start our paper with a more technical part , a brief description of the apparatus , section [ apparatus ] , followed by some frequently used definitions and the centrality selection , section [ centrality ] , and a detailed account of our @xmath14 reconstruction method , section [ reconstruction ]",
    ". the description of results will then start with a presentation in section [ rapidity ] of a systematics of longitudinal and transverse rapidity distributions for various identified ejectiles .",
    "we proceed with deduced information on the three stages of the reaction : compression , or stopping , section [ stopping ] , expansion , or radial flow , section [ radial ] and freeze - out , or chemistry , section [ chemistry ] .",
    "we will use the transport code iqmd @xcite both for technical checks and for an assessment of the basic information that can be extracted from our data .",
    "references to some of the copious earlier literature will be presented wherever relevant in the various sections .",
    "we provide a summary ( besides the abstract and the definition section ) for the quick reader .",
    "the spirit of the present work is similar to the one on pion emission at sis energies @xcite and another paper in preparation on azimuthally asymmetric flow : provide a large systematic data base ( for the sis energy range ) that hopefully can be used for a reassessment of a second generation of nuclear eos and nuclear transport properties , accompanied by the hope that the various existing or still developed transport codes will eventually converge to common conclusions .",
    "the experiments were performed at the heavy ion accelerator sis of gsi / darmstadt using the large acceptance fopi detector @xcite .",
    "a total of 25 system - energies are analysed for this work ( energies per nucleon , @xmath15 , in gev are given in parentheses ) : @xmath1ca+@xmath1ca ( 0.4 , 0.,6 0.8 , 1.0 , 1.5 , 1.93 ) , @xmath2ni+@xmath2ni ( 0.15 , 0.25 ) , @xmath4xe+csi ( 0.15 , 0.25 ) , @xmath3ru+@xmath3ru ( 0.4 , 1.0 , 1.5 ) , @xmath3zr+@xmath3zr ( 0.4 , 1.5 ) , @xmath5au+@xmath5au ( 0.09 , 0.12 , 0.15 , 0.25 , 0.4 , 0.6 , 0.8 , 1.0 , 1.2 , 1.5 ) .",
    "two somewhat different setups were used for the low energy data ( @xmath16 gev ) and the high energy data . for the latter",
    ", particle tracking and energy loss determination were done using two drift chambers , the cdc ( covering polar angles between @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) and the helitron ( @xmath19 ) , both located inside a superconducting solenoid operated at a magnetic field of 0.6 t .",
    "a set of scintillator arrays , plastic wall @xmath20 , zero degree detector @xmath21 , and barrel @xmath22 , allowed us to measure the time of flight and , below @xmath23 , also the energy loss .",
    "the velocity resolution below @xmath23 was @xmath24 , the momentum resolution in the cdc was @xmath25 for momenta of 0.5 to 2 gev / c , respectively .",
    "use of cdc and helitron allowed the identification of pions , as well as good isotope separation for hydrogen and helium clusters in a large part of momentum space .",
    "heavier clusters are separated by nuclear charge .",
    "more features of the experimental method , some of them specific to the cdc , have been described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in the low energy run the helitron drift chamber was not yet available and the barrel surrounding the cdc covered only @xmath26 of the full @xmath27 azimuth . on the other hand a set of gas ionization chambers ( parabola ) installed between the solenoid magnet ( enclosing the cdc ) and the plastic wall",
    "was operated that extended to lower velocities and higher charges the range of charge identified highly ionizing fragments and covered approximately the same angular range as the plastic wall .",
    "the parabola together with the plastic wall represent what we used to call the early phase i of fopi the technical details of which can be found in ref . @xcite .",
    "also in the low energy run , the cdc was operated in a split mode in an effort to extend the dynamical range of measured energy losses along the particle tracks : of the 60 potential wires the inner 30 wires were held under a lower voltage , see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details .",
    "we note that the combination of the two setups allowed us to cover a rather large range of incident @xmath15 : there is approximately a factor of twenty between the lowest and the highest energy .",
    "choosing the @xmath28 as reference frame , orienting the z - axis in the beam direction , and ignoring deviations from axial symmetry the two remaining dimensions are characterized by the longitudinal rapidity @xmath29 , given by @xmath30 and the transverse ( spatial ) component @xmath31 of the four - velocity @xmath32 , given by @xmath33 .",
    "the 3-vector @xmath34 is the velocity in units of the light velocity and @xmath35 . in order to be able to compare longitudinal and transversal degrees of freedom on a common basis",
    ", we shall also use the _ transverse _ rapidity , @xmath36 , which is defined by replacing @xmath37 by @xmath38 in the expression for the longitudinal rapidity .",
    "the @xmath39-axis is laboratory fixed and hence randomly oriented relative to the reaction plane , i.e. we average over deviations from axial symmetry .",
    "the transverse rapidities @xmath36 ( or @xmath40 ) should not be confused with @xmath41 which is defined by replacing @xmath37 by @xmath42 .    for thermally equilibrated systems @xmath43 and the local rapidity distributions @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( rather than @xmath46 ) should have the same shape and height than the usual longitudinal rapidity distribution @xmath47 , where we will omit the subscript @xmath48 when no confusion is likely . throughout we use scaled units @xmath49 and @xmath50 , with @xmath51 , the index p referring to the incident projectile in the @xmath28 . in these units",
    "the initial target - projectile rapidity gap always extends from @xmath52 to @xmath53 . besides the scaled transverse rapidity , @xmath54 , distributions @xmath55 we will also present data on constrained scaled transverse rapidity distributions @xmath56 which are obtained using a midrapidity - cut @xmath57 on the longitudinal rapidities @xmath58 . in this work",
    "the shapes of the various rapidity distributions will often be characterized by their variances which we term _ varz , varx , and varxm _ for the longitudinal , transverse and constrained transverse distributions , respectively , adding a suffix zero if scaled units are used . in section [ varxz ]",
    "we will introduce the ratio @xmath59 which we propose as a measure of _ stopping _ to be discussed in detail in section [ stopping ] .",
    "this ratio , naturally , is scale invariant .",
    "collision centrality selection was obtained by binning distributions of either the detected charge particle multiplicity , mul , or the ratio of total transverse to longitudinal kinetic energies in the center - of - mass ( c.m . ) system , erat . to the degree",
    "where erat is evidently less influenced by clusterization than mul , there is some advantage of using erat when trying to simulate the selections with transport codes that do not reproduce well the measured multiplicities .",
    "as will be clear from our data , a careful matching of centralities between data and simulations is important for correct quantitative conclusions .",
    "erat is related to the stopping observable _ varxz _ defined earlier . to avoid autocorrelations",
    "we have always excluded the particle of interest , for which we build up spectra , from the definition of erat .",
    "we estimate the impact parameter @xmath60 from the measured differential cross sections for the erat or the multiplicity distributions , using a geometrical sharp - cut approximation .",
    "the erat selections show better impact parameter resolution for the most central collisions than the multiplicity selections . in the present work",
    "we will limit ourselves to erat selected data .",
    "more detailed discussions of the centrality selection methods used here can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the sequel , rather than using cryptic names for the various centrality intervals , we shall characterize the centrality by the interval of the scaled impact parameter @xmath61 defined by @xmath62 .",
    "we take @xmath63  fm giving values known @xcite to describe well effective sharp radii of nuclei with mass higher than 40u .",
    "this scaling is useful when comparing systems of different size . in this work we limit ourselves to four centrality bins : @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "most of the data presented here concern the most central bin . in this most central bin typical accepted event numbers vary between @xmath68 for all but the ca+ca data where we registered @xmath69 most central events .",
    "the total number of registered events was approximately ten times higher and was limited by a multiplicity filter .",
    "some minimum bias events were registered at a lower rate .",
    "when comparing to iqmd simulations we also take the erat observable for binning and carefully match the so defined centralities to those of the experiment .",
    "apparatus effects tend to modify the observed shape of the erat distributions .",
    "however , the influence of a realistic apparatus filter on the erat binning quality was found to be very small and was therefore not critical as long as the corresponding cross sections remained matched .",
    "the iqmd version we use in the present work largely corresponds to the description given in ref .",
    "more specifically , the following standard parameters were used throughout : @xmath70 ( wave packet width parameter ) , @xmath71 ( total integration time ) , @xmath72 mev ( compressibility of the momentum dependent soft , resp .",
    "stiff eos , @xmath73 mev ( symmetry energy , with @xmath74 the saturation value of the nuclear density @xmath75 ) . the versions with @xmath76 , resp .",
    "380 mev are called iqmd - sm , resp .",
    "iqmd - hm .",
    "the clusterization was determined from a separate routine using the minimum spanning tree method in configuration space with a clusterization radius @xmath77 fm .",
    "it is of high interest to know the event topology in full @xmath14 coverage .",
    "thus , @xmath14 yields are needed for convincing estimates of chemical freeze - out characteristics , chemical temperatures , entropy generation etc . also stopping characteristics to be extensively discussed later ,",
    "require a large coverage of phase space .",
    "since measured momentum space distributions do not cover the complete @xmath14 phase space they must be complemented by interpolations and extrapolations .",
    "as this is a rather important feature of our data analysis , we devote a whole section to this undertaking .    since this study is limited to symmetric systems , we require reflection symmetry in the center of momentum ( @xmath28 ) .    to start the data treatment , we filter the data to eliminate regions of distorted measurements , such as edge effects .",
    "one advantage of filtering _",
    "data , rather than just the simulated events , is that well defined sharp limits are introduced which can then be applied in exactly the same form to simulations ( see later ) .",
    "examples of these sharp filtered data are given in figs .",
    "1,2,4,5 and 6 .",
    "a second advantage of these sharp filters , that are more restrictive than just the nominal geometries of the various sub - detectors , is that within the remaining acceptances detector efficiencies are close to @xmath78 .",
    "for example , studies of measured correlated adjacent detector hit probabilities in the plastic wall showed a worst case ( au+au at @xmath79 gev ) double hit probability of @xmath80 , lowering the apparent total multiplicity , which was nearly compensated by a cross - talk between detector units of @xmath81 , raising the apparent multiplicity .",
    "this cross talk was mainly due to imperfect alignment of the beam axis with the apparatus .",
    "the rationale for dropping further going detailed efficiency considerations _ within _ the filtered acceptances was that the charge balances , after @xmath14 reconstruction , were found to be accurate to typically @xmath82 ( see the tables in the appendix ) for all the 25 system - energies studied , i.e. for a statistically significant sampling encompassing a large variation in energy and multiplicity . in our analysis",
    "the plastic wall and the cdc are treated as master detectors required for the registration of an ejectile .",
    "the helitron efficiency was taken care of by matching its signals for h isotopes to z=1 hits in the plastic wall after subtracting from the plastic wall hits the estimated pion contributions known from our earlier study @xcite . at incident energies beyond @xmath83 gev , where the plastic wall showed a large background for @xmath84 ,",
    "a matching of z with the helitron was required ( in addition to track matching ) using the energy loss signals and assuming for the helitron the same efficiency as for z=1 .",
    "other assumptions were found to be in conflict with the global charge balances .",
    "the barrel , as a slave detector to the cdc , was used to improve isotope identification ( for h and he ) whenever its signal matched the cdc tracking .",
    "the mixing of adjacent particles is estimated to be less or equal to @xmath85 , except for tritons and @xmath86he in the low energy run where it could be up to @xmath87 .    in",
    "the following step each measured phase - space cell @xmath88 and its local surrounding @xmath89 cells , with @xmath90 , is least squares fitted using the ansatz @xmath91\\ ] ] where @xmath92 is a five parameter function .",
    "this procedure smoothens out statistical errors and allows subsequently a well defined extension to gaps in the data . within errors",
    "the smoothened representation of the data follows the topology of the original data : deviations of @xmath82 are caused by local distortions of the apparatus response , revealing typical systematic uncertainties .",
    "the technical parameters of the procedure were chosen to be @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , i.e. the local fitting domain consisted of a maximum of 55 cells .",
    "these choices were governed by the available statistics and the need to follow the measured topology within statistical and systematic errors .",
    "variations of these parameters were investigated to determine the systematic errors of the procedure .",
    "the smoothened data are well suited for the final step : the extrapolation to zero transverse momenta",
    ". the low @xmath97 extrapolation was extensively checked by event simulations using both thermal models or transport codes . for fragments separated only by charge",
    "the phase space coverage of fopi is rather good and the extension to @xmath14 is unproblematic .",
    "when reconstructing the isotope separated distributions we have used the constraint that the sum of isotopes of z=1 and 2 should be consistent _ in every phase space cell _",
    "@xmath88 with the total value for z=1 , resp . z=2 fragments ( henceforth dubbed sum - of - isotopes check ) .",
    "this ensures at low @xmath97 that coulomb effects are approximately respected .    finally , a word on systematic errors : systematic errors are dominated by forward - backward inconsistencies and extrapolation uncertainties .",
    "the estimates for the latter were guided by the accuracy of the total charge balances and the isotope balances .",
    "the global systematic errors on particle yields are given in the appendix .",
    "the small straggling of differential data due to generally good statistics and the smoothening fits suggest point to point errors smaller than the global errors .    in the following we show a few illustrative examples of the @xmath14 reconstructions .",
    "the above ansatz in terms of exponential functions to limited two - dimensional phase space cells is inspired by the thermal model , but does allow for deviations from it .",
    "of course in case the thermal model would represent the data well , we would recover the thermal model parameterization ( i.e. the temperature ) .",
    "this is shown in our first example below ( fig .",
    "[ au250c1z1a2 ] ) .",
    "the sharp filter used in this case is representative of the actual acceptance for isotope separated fragments in the low energy runs .",
    "as can be seen the reconstruction in this case is close to perfect and purely statistical errors can be neglected .",
    "the following example shows the application to a case which can not be a thermal distribution since it is the superposition of the three isotopes ( p , d , t ) of hydrogen . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ uty - au1500c1z1 ] , there are three separate contributions to the phase space distribution after applying the filter : they are from the cdc , the helitron and the zero degree detectors .",
    "we show both the experimental data and the simulation with iqmd .",
    "pion contributions are excluded or subtracted using the information obtained in @xcite .",
    "the reconstruction of the full acceptance rapidity distribution of the simulation causes no difficulty as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ dndy - au1500c1z1 ] .",
    "the existence of low @xmath97 data due to the zero degree proves to be a very useful constraint on the reconstruction .",
    "the acceptance for identified protons in the higher energy runs was more restricted since the zero degree detector did not allow isotope separation and the need to use the helitron in addition to the plastic wall restricted the forward part of the detector somewhat .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ au1500c1z1a1 ] .",
    "still , we find that the reconstruction , for _ central _ collisions ( which are of prime interest here ) is very satisfactory .    a case with a typical isotope acceptance ( for deuterons here ) in the low energy runs , where only the cdc was available for isotope separation , is shown in fig .",
    "[ au150c4z1a2 ] . with the sharp filter distorted phase space cells near @xmath52 due to multiple scattering effects in the target",
    "are also cut out . due to missing low @xmath97 information and despite the mentioned constraints from the more complete data on @xmath98 fragments , the reconstruction has to allow for about @xmath99 errors indicated by the plotted systematic error bars .",
    "the accumulated counts in the experiment were actually 10 times higher than in the shown iqmd simulation , so that uncertainties originating here also from finite statistics were smaller in the experiment .",
    "on the other hand , again , the relatively faithful @xmath14 reconstruction is limited to _ central _ collisions , where low @xmath97 spectator material is not so copious . here",
    "the sum - of - isotopes check proved to be mandatory to make sure there was no extrapolation catastrophe. constraints from charge separated data obtained with the zero degree detector , covering low transverse momenta , were used for these checks .",
    "the @xmath14 reconstruction of fragments with @xmath100 , that we call here heavy clusters ( _ hc _ ) is somewhat problematic due to the more limited acceptance , although the two - dimensional extrapolation procedure is an improvement over the conventional one - dimensional extrapolation with separated rapidity bins .",
    "the results presented here for _ hc _ , see also ref .",
    "@xcite , should be considered to be estimates when applied for example to @xmath101 spectra . in fig .",
    "[ ecmtcm - au90c1 ] we show an illustrative picture of what it meant to reconstruct to @xmath14. a stringent test using iqmd was not possible here due to limited statistics available for _ hc _ in the simulation .",
    "however , observables , such as stopping , relying on @xmath14 coverage , were found to be in very reasonable agreement with indra data @xcite . as can be seen by inspecting fig .",
    "[ ecmtcm - au90c1 ] , the increased stopping at an incident energy of @xmath102 gev as compared to @xmath103 gev ( larger transverse momenta relative to the longitudinal ones ) is already suggested _ before _ the extrapolation .      as mentioned in section [ apparatus ]",
    ", the cdc was operated in split mode in the low energy runs , i.e. with a different voltage , @xcite , on the inner wires . despite careful calibration to take this into account , it turned out by comparison with later runs made without the split voltage feature , that an additional correction was needed for the low energy runs . fortunately this correction could be shown to involve just a simple rescaling factor .",
    "this is illustrated in figs .",
    "[ ekin - au400c1z1a1 ] and [ dndy - au400c1z1a3f - resc ] which consist both of two panels , the left one showing for central au+au collisions at @xmath104 gev differences of the two operating modes ( the earlier one with split voltage ) before , and , in the right panel , after correction with a constant rescaling factor .",

    "the rescalings in both figures [ ekin - au400c1z1a1 ] and [ dndy - au400c1z1a3f - resc ] was primarily along the abscissa , the rescaling of the ordinates then followed from the condition that the integrated yields were not affected .",
    "to avoid too many arbitrary parameters , the rescaling factors were fixed for all the low energy data down to @xmath103 gev .",
    "an example of the resulting extremely smooth behaviour of excitation functions for average kinetic energies covering the complete data is shown in fig .",
    "[ ekinavc4-r - p ] .",
    "as will be shown later , this surprisingly regular trend is also predicted by iqmd simulations .",
    "we use scaled energy units here : a value equal to one indicates an energy equal to the incoming c.m . kinetic energy per nucleon .",
    "the figure also shows the reasonable agreement with data from ref .",
    "@xcite which were obtained by our collaboration using a different method .",
    "while we show here only a comparison for protons for reasons of space economy , similar conclusions hold for all other isotopes of hydrogen and helium .      by z - renormalization",
    "we address the sum - of - isotopes check and correction after @xmath14 reconstruction , which uses the fact , shown earlier , that we had a more complete acceptance for fragments identified by charge only .",
    "this was most important for the low energy runs .",
    "we illustrate the necessary renormalization in fig .",
    "[ dndym - au150c1pdt - r ] for hydrogen and helium isotopes in central collisions of au+au at @xmath105 gev .",
    "while renormalization is seen to be only a small effect for hydrogen , the worst case scenario shown for helium requires a significant correction for low transverse velocities , which can be traced back to errors due to not accounting properly for coulomb repulsion effects on low momenta not covered by our data .",
    "we present the phase space distributions in a way which deviates somewhat from the traditional way : instead of showing standard ( longitudinal ) rapidity distributions on a linear ordinate scale and then switching for the transverse direction to transverse momentum distributions on a logarithmic scale , we show the transverse degree of freedom in the same representation as the longitudinal degree of freedom , namely in terms of transverse rapidities plotted on a linear scale as well ( see definitions in section [ centrality ] ) .",

    "however for the interpretation of stopping excitation functions of one specific particle , here protons , extending over more than three orders in the magnitude of the incident energy , it is important to realize that they can be misleading on the _ global _ system trend .",
    "the reason is that stopping hierarchies are omnipresent . at the low energy end protons",

    "we are lead to expect stopping hierarchies in the higher energy regimes similar to the ones described here , but shall not pursue this as it would far exceed the scope of the present work . as consequence of incomplete stopping , the time the system spends at maximum compression ( and heat ) is shortened . this could prevent the full development of critical fluctuations expected theoretically in certain areas of the phase diagram .",

    "the straight lines plotted in the various panels join the proton and deuteron data to the average kinetic energy of @xmath167 and @xmath86h and ignore the @xmath114 data .",
    "as can be seen , the average mass three value continues the proton - deuteron trend with a remarkable accuracy , an observation that we found to be true for all studied system - energies and centralities ( see also fig .",

    "[ ekinav - au120c4 ] to an offset temperature @xmath174 using relativistic formulae and ignoring mean field contributions to @xmath173 , in particular coulomb fields .",
    "this allows us to compare to the analysis of @xcite , although the authors seem to have handled the data structures differently .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ radialflow - au - lisa ] .",
    "the two datasets with nearly matched centralities are compatible , although our offset temperatures are systematically somewhat higher .",
    "our data extend over a larger energy range and follow a more regular trend fixed by smaller error bars .",
    "the interpretation of the data in terms of a collective flow and a common local temperature is probably too naive : the stopping hierarchies evidenced in section [ rapidity ] make a perfectly common flow improbable .",
    "we expect further the apparent offset @xmath174 parameters to be influenced both by coulomb fields ( especially at the low energy end ) and by the repulsive nuclear fields built up by the compression ( see fig .  [ vartl - indra ] ) .      in fig .",
    "[ ekinav-150c4 ] we show the system size dependence of radial flow varying the incident energy by one order of magnitude .",
    "the increasing trend with system size is striking and characteristic for all energies . in each panel",
    "two sets of data are shown : the data points plotted with the open symbols and the larger error bars were obtained fitting two parameters separately to the data for one incident energy , the flow ( slope ) and the offset @xmath174 .",
    "the second set of data points were obtained using a common offset @xmath174 indicated in the panel , a constraint allowing to fix the flow value better .",
    "the difference between the two curves is small .",
    "however we find , when allowing two adjustable parameters for each system , that the @xmath174 values is not completely independent of the system size : from the lightest system to the heaviest ( au+au ) there is an increase by about @xmath87 .",
    "this could be a relic of the repulsive mean fields due to increased compression in heavier systems .",
    "unfortunately the uncertainty of @xmath174 is relatively large .",
    "the observed system size dependence of the radial flow is not trivial : a comparison with the simulation using iqmd - sm , see fig .",
    "[ ekinav-1000c4q ] , reveals that the strong dependence of the data on system size is not correctly reproduced . in @xcite , using iqmd , the authors conclude that radial flow is not sensitive to the eos : they find that the sum of two contributions to this kind of flow , namely the mean field eos and the nucleon - nucleon scatterings , tends to be the same for a stiff , resp .",
    "soft eos . in the soft case",
    "the scatterings dominate because of the larger compression reached but this is compensated by the less repulsive mean fields .",
    "in view of the failure to reproduce the observed size dependence it is possible to question this conclusion .",
    "the increased production of clusters in larger systems , correlated with increased radial flow and stopping could well be a memory of the original compression ( cooling by compression followed by expansion ) .",
    "in @xcite it was found that softer eos favours cluster formation at freeze out .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the theoretical work of ref .",
    "@xcite .      for incident energies below @xmath175 we were able to obtain data for fragments up to nuclear charge 6 - 8 , depending somewhat on the incident energy .",
    "although such data , not separated by isotope , and more limited in acceptance ( see fig .",
    "[ ecmtcm - au90c1 ] ) have been published ( phase i ) and extensively discussed earlier by our collaboration , @xcite , it is worthwhile to look again at these data in the light of the present more complete phase ii information and new insights . the relevant information is summarized in fig .",
    "[ ekinav - au90c1 - 6 ] where we show the nuclear charge dependence of kinetic energies in central collisions of au+au for five incident energies varying from 0.09a gev to 0.4a gev",
    ". an earlier evaluation of these data , showing similar features , has been presented in @xcite .",
    "the results can not be compared directly : in ref .",
    "@xcite a coordinate system rotated into the flow axis was used and in - plane fragments were suppressed .",

    "obviously the slopes of the fitted lines ( @xmath178 method ) are very different for the two polar angle ranges ( in agreement with @xcite ) , but they tend to gradually align as the energy is raised ( see upper right panel in the figure ) , a confirmation of the global trend of increasing stopping in this range of incident energies ( fig .",
    "[ vartl - indra ] ) . increased stopping leads to a more isotropic distribution of kinetic energy , that was also visible for the light charged particles ( fig .",
    "[ varauc1pdt-4 ] , upper right panel showing the @xmath104 gev data ) .",
    "it is fair to remind at this stage , that while the data below @xmath179 are well covered by our acceptance , the data around @xmath101 are somewhat less reliable due to the necessity for a two - dimensional extrapolation ( section [ reconstruction ] ) .",
    "we are confident that the major conclusions are not seriously affected as , below @xmath180 gev , our analysis was found to be consistent with the more complete indra data @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to compare the apparent radial flow deduced by the 2z method , fig .",
    "[ ekinav - au90c1 - 6 ] , with that deduced by the a3 method , fig .",
    "[ ekinav - au120c4 ] .",

    "[ ekinav - au120c4 ] which is constrained to @xmath65 and therefore yields @xmath170 values lower by 4 to 7 @xmath181 ) .",
    "one sees the convergence of the two methods at @xmath104 gev where stopping is maximal , but at lower incident energies the a3 method yields higher values .",
    "we suggest to correlate this with the pronounced stopping hierarchy found at the lower energies ( section [ stopping ] ) . clearly then",
    ", one needs to correct the apparent mass dependences for this effect when converting them to radial flow .",
    "this requires transport codes that reproduce the observed clusterization and stopping hierarchy .    at this stage",
    "we wish to make a comment to our flow analysis published in 1997 , @xcite . in the light of the present extensive information on incomplete stopping and",
    "hence strong deviations from isotropy , the earlier analyses assuming spheric expansion and neglecting partial transparency must be revised in the sense that the flow values found using the limited acceptance of the phase i of fopi included a significant longitudinal ( memory ) component .",
    "thus the analysis included some counter - streaming effects of the nucleons due to incomplete stopping ( see fig .  [ var-150-a ] ) .",
    "as the method used in @xcite was strictly constrained by energy conservation , the sum of radial and two - fluid counter flow turned out to be correct , but the interpretation of the mass or charge dependence of the kinetic energies at these forward angles as just radial ( spheric ) flow can not be upheld .",
    "the data themselves remain valid , except for a subtle effect on the topology of the two - dimensional ( @xmath182 vs rapidity @xmath151 ) spectra : applying the erat criterion on the apparatus limited in phase i to laboratory angles forward of @xmath183 lead for the most central collisions ( i.e. in the tails of the erat distributions ) to an underestimation of the anisotropy as the selection criterion favoured events with a higher hit rate near the large angle apparatus limits , increasing the apparent isotropy . in the present work , with the significantly larger phase ii acceptance , this effect , caused by event - by - event fluctuations ,",
    "is minimized .      in section [ rapidity ]",
    "it was shown that the constrained rapidity distributions could be well reproduced with a thermal ansatz , giving an equivalent temperature @xmath111 .",
    "this represents an alternative way of systematizing mass dependences of phase space distributions .",
    "a systematics of @xmath111 is shown in the next four figures that close this section .",
    "we find a similarity with the systematics of average kinetic energies of fragments emitted around @xmath101 : compare fig .",
    "[ ekinav - au120c4 ] with fig .",
    "[ dndym-150c1lcp - teq ] .",
    "however , since the phase - space cuts are different and the stopping is incomplete ( non - spherical topology ) , the deduced parameters are not substitutes for each other . while we have started with @xmath101 kinetic energies primarily to join up to some of the earlier literature @xcite , the @xmath111 characterizing the constrained rapidity distributions",

    "note the strikingly different system size dependence of nucleonic clusters and of pions : while the @xmath111 of pions slowly ( the data are plotted with an ordinate offset ) decrease with system size , the contrary is true for the hydrogen isotopes . again , as suggested earlier , this is correlated to the different consequences of compression ( creation of pions ) and decompression - cooling ( reabsorption of pions , creation of clusters from nucleonic matter ) .    apparent temperatures for protons and deuterons in ni+ni collisions have already been published earlier by our collaboration @xcite . if we interpolate the data in fig .",
    "[ dndym-1000c1lcp - teq-2 ] to estimate the ni+ni values we obtain @xmath111 values exceeding those of @xcite by about @xmath184 .",
    "it is unlikely that the difference is due to a different analysis method .",
    "one possible explanation is the different methods used to select the most central collisions . in @xcite the multiplicity was maximized between the polar laboratory angles @xmath185 , while in the present work erat , determined using the full apparatus acceptance , was maximized .    in fig .",

    "note that we include in this balance also the pions , @xcite .",
    "other created particles , such as kaons etc , are negligible on the @xmath82 level ( but are of course interesting for many other reasons ) .",
    "for the two lowest energies we miss significant contributions from heavy clusters beyond z=8 .",
    "the interested reader might consult indra - aladin works @xcite for more complete distributions in the energy range at and below @xmath105 gev .",

    "an early , instructive presentation of the arguments in favour of a conjectured chemical equilibrium at freeze - out can be found in @xcite .",
    "even if one does not adopt the equilibrium assumption , ( many of the observations presented in this work do not favour the equilibrium assumption ) the degree of clusterization quantized by these yields can be used to constrain the outgoing ( non - equilibrium ) entropy @xcite .",
    "this information , together with our extensive data on stopping , section [ stopping ] , can be used to assess the viscosity to entropy ratio that is currently intensely investigated in connection with the quark - gluon phase thought to be copiously produced at the highest currently available energies @xcite . the task of analysing our chemistry data using a modern thermal code that bridges the low - energy multifragmentation regime with the high energy particle - producing regime using a realistic approach for late decays is delayed to later publications . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that a purely statistical interpretation of the non - collective part of the available energy using various statistical codes that included late evaporations was not successful as it strongly underestimated the yields of heavy clusters , such as oxygen .",
    "this conclusion is not touched by the now favoured interpretation of the collective energy as being to a sizeable part due to still two - fluid flow caused by incomplete stopping .",
    "in contrast to this failure one has to acknowledge a very reasonable rendering of the full nuclear charge distributions for au on au at 0.15 and @xmath102 gev when using the amd code ( antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ) @xcite .",
    "this transport code does not rely on the equilibrium assumption .    despite the different data analysis method , the yields listed in the appendix for au+au at 0.15 , 0.25 and @xmath104 gev are fully compatible with those published earlier by our collaboration @xcite .",
    "the possibility to compare these yields with those published by other authors are limited : besides the need to match centralities , one is generally confronted with the lack of @xmath14 estimates . as shown partially in @xcite , our data",
    "are nicely compatible with indra data in the low energy range where the measurements overlap and centralities have been carefully aligned .",
    "the situation on cluster production as it existed in the mid - eighties was described in @xcite .",
