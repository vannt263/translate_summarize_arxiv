    "the finite system size modifies and smooths phase transition effects . in the second case",
    "a tiny modification of certain hamiltonian parameter or parameters ( control parameters ) induces an abrupt change in the ground state of the quantum system and quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) appear as an effect of quantum fluctuations at the critical value of the control parameter @xcite .",
    "qpts strictly occur in infinite systems , though qpt precursors are present in finite systems .",
    "in fact , bosonic models allow to study both aforementioned aspects : finite - size effects and zero temperature qpts .",
    "recent reviews on this subject are @xcite .",
    "qpts occurring in finite - size systems can be characterized by the disappearance of the gap between the ground and the first excited state energies in the mean field or thermodynamic limit ( infinite system size ) .",
    "the qpt is a first order phase transition if a level crossing occurs and a continuous transition if there are no crossings ( except in the limit value ) @xcite .",
    "the landau theory holds in the models addressed in this presentation , and within this theory the ehrenfest classification of qpts is valid . in this case , the order of a qpt is assigned on the basis of discontinuities in derivatives of the potential of the system at the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "the assignment of the order of a phase transitions in finite - size systems using a numerical treatment to compute finite differences of the system energy functional can be a cumbersome task . in order to overcome this problem , different approaches have been proposed .",
    "et al . _ have used the study of nonhermitian degeneracies near critical points to classify the order of qpts @xcite .",
    "alternative characterizations are based in the connection between geometric berry phases and qpts in the case of the xy ising model @xcite and in the overlap between two ground state wave functions for different values of the control parameter ( fidelity susceptibility concept ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , many efforts have been devoted to characterize qpts in terms of information theoretic measures of delocalization ( see @xcite and references therein ) and quantum information tools , e.  g.  using entanglement entropy measures ( see e.g.  @xcite for the dicke model and @xcite for the vibron model ) .    in this work",
    "we propose an alternative way to reckon the order of a qpt by using the wehrl entropy in the phase - space ( coherent state or bargmann ) representation of quantum states @xmath0 provided by the husimi function @xmath1 , which is defined as the squared overlap between @xmath0 and an arbitrary coherent state .",
    "the husimi function has been widely used in quantum physics , mainly in quantum optics .",
    "for example , the time evolution of coherent states of light in a kerr medium is visualized by measuring @xmath2 by cavity state tomography , observing quantum collapses and revivals , and confirming the non - classical properties of the transient states @xcite .",
    "moreover , the zeros of this phase - space quasi - probability distribution have been used as an indicator of the regular or chaotic behavior in quantum maps for a variety of quantum problems : molecular @xcite and atomic @xcite systems , the kicked top @xcite , quantum billiards @xcite , or condensed matter systems @xcite ( see also @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "they have also been considered as an indicator of metal - insulator @xcite and topological - band insulator @xcite phase transitions , as well as of qpts in bose einstein condensates @xcite and in the dicke @xcite , vibron @xcite , and lipkin - meshkov - glick ( lmg ) models @xcite .    to identify the order of a qpt we suggest to observe the singular behavior of the wehrl entropy , @xmath3 , of the husimi function , @xmath1 , near the critical point as the system size increases .",
    "the wehrl entropy , is defined in sec .",
    "[ wehrlsec ] as a function of the hamiltonian control parameter(s ) and the system s size . for harmonic oscillators ,",
    "lieb proved in @xcite the wehrl s conjecture @xcite stating that @xmath3 attains its minimum ( maximum area ) when @xmath0 is an ordinary ( heisemberg - weyl ) coherent state .",
    "this proof has been recently extended by lieb and solovej to su(2 ) spin-@xmath4 systems @xcite .",
    "we observe that @xmath3 is maximum at the critical point of a first - order qpt , and this maximum is narrower as the system size increases .",
    "however , for second - order qpts , the wehrl entropy displays a step function behavior at the critical point , and again the transition is sharper for larger system sizes",
    ". we shall confirm this behavior for five models : quantum cusp , dicke , lmg , a one - dimensional realization of the interacting boson model ( ibm - lmg ) , and the 2d limit of the vibron model ( 2dvm ) .",
    "we have chosen the cusp model as a prototypical case , because this is probably the best known catastrophe example , describing the bifurcation of a critical point with a quartic potential .",
    "its quantum version @xcite has been used to illustrate the effects associated with criticality as a prior step to deal with more involved physical situations @xcite .",
    "in addition to the cusp model , we present results for four different realizations of bosonic systems .",
    "the lmg model is a simple model , originally introduced for the description of nuclear systems as an exactly - solvable toy model to assess the quality of different approximations @xcite .",
    "this ubiquitous model still receives a major attention , further stimulated by its recent experimental realization @xcite .",
    "the study of the ground state quantum phase transitions for this model can be traced back to the seminal articles of gilmore and feng @xcite .",
    "the dicke model is a quantum - optical model that describes the interaction of a radiation field with @xmath5 two - level atoms @xcite .",
    "this model has recently renewed interest @xcite , partly because a tunable matter - radiation interaction is a keynote ingredient for the study of quantum critical effects @xcite and partly because the model phase transition has been observed experimentally @xcite .",

    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the 2dvm is the simplest two - level model which still retains a non - trivial angular momentum quantum number and it has been used as a playground to illustrate ground state and excited state qpts features in bosonic models @xcite .    we proceed to present the hamiltonian of the five different addressed models , defining the wehrl entropy as functions of the moments of the husimi function @xmath1 , and the results obtained in the first and second order critical points of the different models considered .",
