    "there are many other types of steady - source science that _ swift _ addresses including surveys of galactic sources , agn , and galaxies . in this paper , however , we cover only transient sources .",
    "the key to unraveling long grbs , i.e. , placing them at cosmological distances , came in 1997 with the first localizations and subsequent host galaxy redshift determinations . similarly with short grbs the breakthrough happened in may - july 2005 with afterglows of short grbs discovered by _ swift _ ( gehrels et al .",
    "2004 ) and _ hete-2 _ ( ricker et al . 2003 ) .",
    "grb 050509b was the first short grb to show an x - ray counterpart , with a @xmath39 arcsec localization ( gehrels et al . 2005 ) .",
    "deep follow - up observations failed to reveal optical afterglow but did discover a massive @xmath4 elliptical galaxy near the x - ray error circle , with a chance coincidence probability of @xmath3@xmath5 ( castro - tirado et al . 2005 ; gehrels et al .",

    "2005 ) . as with grb 050509b",
    ", optical follow - up also ruled out the presence of an associated supernova ( hjorth et al .",

    "swift _ discovery , the short grb 050724 ( barthelmy et al . 2005 ) which resulted in the discovery of x - ray , optical / near - ir , and the first radio afterglow ( figure [ fig : scott ] ) .",
    "it yielded another subarcsecond localization in an elliptical galaxy , at @xmath7 ( berger et al .",
    "the ratio of radio to x - ray afterglow emission also demonstrated that both the energy and density scale were lower than for long grbs ( berger et al . 2005b ) .",
    "taken together , these three early events showed that short grbs are cosmological , they produce afterglow emission similar to that of long grbs but with a lower energy and density scale , and their progenitors are not massive stars ( given their lack of associated supernovae ) .",

    "the xrt position has been revised from antonelli et al .",

    "the projected offset from the center of the galaxy corresponds to @xmath8 kpc assuming the standard cosmology .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] -0.05truein    ten years after the discovery of short grb afterglows more than 70 short grbs have been found by _ swift _ and other @xmath9ray satellites ( berger 2014 ) .",
    "a sizable fraction have x - ray and optical afterglows ; a few have been detected in the radio .",
    "the localizations and optical follow - up work have identified @xmath340 host galaxies and enabled detailed studies of the intragalactic locations of short grbs . an _ hst _",
    "study of 10 short grbs within their host galaxies reveals they trace the light distribution of their hosts , while long grbs are concentrated in the brightest regions of their host galaxies ( berger et al . 2005a ; fong , berger , & fox 2010 ) .",
    "fong et al .",
    "( 2010 ) find that the median value of the projected offset from host center for short grbs of @xmath35 kpc is about 5 times larger than that for the corresponding long grb median offset .",
    "interestingly , when the two offset distributions are normalized to the size of the host galaxy , they lie almost on top of each other . in other words ,",
    "the host galaxies for long grbs are @xmath31/5 as large on average than those of short grbs . in an updated _ hst _",
    "study using 22 short grbs fong & berger ( 2013 ) refine their previous results , and furthermore find that short grbs strongly under - represent their hosts rest - frame optical and uv light ; a fraction @xmath3@xmath10 are located in regions with no stellar light , and @xmath30.55 in regions with no uv light .",
    "therefore fong & berger conclude that short grb progenitors must migrate over considerable distances before their eventual explosions , which supports the idea of progenitor kicks in compact binary systems and the ns - ns merger model for short grbs .",

    "the transition times in seconds after @xmath11 are given , as well as the approximate power law decay indices associated with each segment . phase `` 0 '' corresponds to the prompt emission .",
    "sometimes bright flares accompany the plateau phase , segment ii .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] -0.05truein    by the time _",
    "swift _ had discovered a handful of grbs and their xrt x - ray light curves were studied in detail , several basic features became obvious ( zhang et al .",
    "2006 ; nousek et al .",
    "2006 ; obrien et al .",
    "this now standard picture of the x - ray decay came as somewhat of a surprise and certainly was not expected before _ swift_. the canonical x - ray behavior , depicted schematically in figure [ fig : bingz ] , consists of up to five distinct @xmath12 segments : ( 0 ) emission coincident with the prompt emission , ( i ) an initial steep decay @xmath13 , ( ii ) a shallow decay @xmath14 , ( iii ) a steeper decay @xmath15 , and finally ( iv ) a slightly steeper decay @xmath16 . the transition times between segments are given in figure [ fig : bingz ] .",
    "in addition , one often sees ( v ) large flares superposed on the shallow decay branch .    the initial steep decay ( tagliaferri et al . 2005 ) is associated with the tail of the prompt emission .",
    "early speculation was that it is due to photons that are radiated at large angles relative to our line of sight in the initial fireball  so called `` high - latitude '' emission ( kumar & panaitescu 2000 ) .",
    "however , subsequent study showed that the predicted relation between spectra index and temporal decay index was not borne out by the data ( obrien et al .",
    "2006 , see their fig .",
    "the prolonged emission associated with the shallow decay prompted much theoretical work on `` continuous '' or `` delayed '' energy injection models .",
    "it was thought that the forward shock keeps being refreshed for some time , possibly due to a long - lived central engine , a wide distribution of lorentz factors in the jet , or possibly the deceleration of a poynting flux - dominated jet .",
    "these speculations led to a variety of models based on fall - back accretion disks ( kumar , narayan , & johnson 2008 ; cannizzo & gehrels 2009 ) , magnetars ( dallosso et al .",
    "2011 ; obrien & rowlinson 2012 ; rowlinson et al .",
    "2013 ) , and various other ideas such as `` prior emission '' ( yamazaki 2009 ) .",
    "recent work based on relativistic hydrodynamical computations favors the standard picture in which a baryon dominated jet directed along our line - of - sight breaks through the photosphere of a progenitor ( duffell & macfadyen 2014 )",
    ". this model may be able to account for all the decay phases observed by xrt ( duffell & macfadyen 2014 ) .",
    "in this ( now canonical ) model a jet launched ballistically from near the progenitor core with a bulk lorentz factor @xmath17 undergoes strong shock heating and lateral confinement , so that when it emerges from the progenitor it has a large internal energy @xmath18 .",
    "the subsequent jet expansion due to the large @xmath19 leads to an effective lorentz factor @xmath20 for a distant , line - of - sight observer .",
    "the grb prompt @xmath9radiation is produced by strong internal shocks in the expanding fireball at the point where it becomes optically thin to its own radiation .    .",
    "the bright x - ray flare is superposed on this underlying power - law decay . at later times",
    "the light curve has several bumps , both suggesting late - time energy injection into the external shock or continued internal shock activity .",
    "the rapid decline in count rate for grb 050502b at @xmath21 s indicates a possible jet break at @xmath3@xmath22 d postburst .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] -0.05truein    large x - ray flares associated with grbs ( chincarini et al .",
    "2007 ; falcone et al . 2007 ) suggest that the grb central engine is very likely still active after the prompt gamma - ray emission is over , but with a reduced activity at later times .",
    "figure [ fig : flare ] shows a giant flare in grb 050502b with a total energy comparable to the burst itself .",
    "these strong , rapid x - ray flares have been seen in other bursts and indicate that the central engines of the bursts have long periods of activity , with strong internal shocks continuing for hundreds of seconds after the gamma - ray emission has ended .",
    "flares have also been seen in short grbs , e.g. grb050724 ( grupe et al .",
    "on 18 february 2006 _ swift _ detected the remarkable burst grb 060218 which shed light on the connection between sne and grbs .",
    "it lasted longer than and was softer than any previous burst , and was associated with sn 2006aj at only @xmath23 .",
    "the bat trigger enabled xrt and uvot observations during the prompt phase of the grb and initiated multiwavelength observations of the supernova from the time of initial core collapse .",

    "2006 ) , the first such association for a grb - sn event .",
    "combined bat - xrt - uvot observations provided the first direct observation of shock - breakout in a sn ( campana et al .",
    "this is inferred from the evolution of a soft thermal component in the x - ray and uv spectra , and early time luminosity variations .",

    "grb 060218 was an underluminous burst , as were two of the other three previous cases .",
