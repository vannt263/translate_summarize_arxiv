    "an electron beam ion trap ( ebit ) @xcite is an ideal tool to study radiation of highly charged ions as well as the interactions between electrons and ions - electron impact ionization , electron - ion recombination processes .",
    "electron beam interacting with ions in an ion trap region produces atoms of element in the desirable ionization state which is determined by the energy of electrons .",
    "neighboring ionization states are less populated because the energy of electrons is too small to reach next ionization state or too large to stay in the current one .",
    "consequently , the analysis for lines of spectra can be focused on the main ionization states obtained in the plasma .",
    "in addition , low density is another specific characteristic of the plasma .",
    "it is assumed that steady state is reached and population of levels does not change in time .",
    "mainly collisional - radiative modeling is applied describing the population and depopulation of the levels .",
    "collisional - radiative modeling in the steady state conditions has been successfully used for the analysis of spectra from highly charged tungsten ions being trapped in the ebit @xcite .",
    "however , it was shown that the population of the levels can be determined using coronal approximation @xcite , i.e. only collisional excitation from the ground state needs to be considered .",
    "good agreement has been obtained for line intensities when compared with data from collisional - radiative modeling . on the other hand , cascade emission , as a general rule ,",
    "is omitted in the analysis of spectral line formation for the ebit plasma .",
    "we should note that term cascade emission is used here instead of radiative cascade in order to distinguish population of levels from higher levels through radiative cascade which is included in collisional - radiative model . as will be shown later ,",
    "the population of levels differs for those two cases .",
    "the cascade processes have been mostly investigated for radiative and auger decays of inner shell vacancies @xcite .",
    "however , trapped ions interact with electrons in the beam , but due to cycloidal orbits the ions can spend part of their time outside the electron beam @xcite .",
    "process of the cascade emission has to start when interaction with electrons ends .",
    "this effect is more important for ions in the lower or medium effective charge states @xcite .",
    "it was found that under same conditions , higher charge ions show less expansion in the radial direction .",
    "when the charge state of ions increases the coulomb s attraction force directed toward electron beam also increases which lead to the decrease of the time ions spend outside the beam where the cascade emission depopulates excited levels .",
    "the role of cascade emission depends on the time the ions spend inside and outside the electron beam .",
    "however , this time is determined by many parameters : ion temperature , electron beam energy , electron beam current , electric and magnetic fields . on the other hand ,",
    "the time fraction ions moves in the electron beam can be approximately related to the electron beam diameter and radial distribution of ions in the trap .",
    "effective electron density is often introduced in order to reduce ion - electron collision rates because ions do not dwell all the time in the electron beam region @xcite .",
    "it was found that range of ion radius @xmath3 ratio against the geometric electron radius @xmath4 can be expressed through the effective charge @xmath5 of ion : @xmath6 with @xmath7 @xcite . for @xmath0",
    ", we have @xmath8 , i. e. ions mainly reside outside the electron beam .    in this work",
    "we show the importance of cascade emission to the formation of spectra from ebit plasma in electron trapping mode . to our knowledge ,",
    "up to know the cascade emission in electron trapping mode has not been analyzed .",
    "cascade emission has been investigated previously in magnetic trapping mode @xcite observing x - ray emission after charge exchange of neutrals with highly charged ions .",
    "magnetic trapping mode takes place after the electron beam is switched off , thus , electron - impact excitation does not influence the population of levels .",
    "our demonstration for the role of cascade emission in electron trapping mode is based on the investigation of @xmath0 spectra obtained at the berlin ebit @xcite . using the berlin ebit facilities hutton et al .",
    "@xcite measured spectra of the tungsten ions at electron beam energies corresponding to the maximum production of @xmath0 ions in the ebit plasma .",
    "they looked for resonance lines corresponding to the @xmath9 transition which could be candidates for fusion plasma diagnostics .",
    "it was expected that if collapse of @xmath10 orbitals had occurred in the ion then two prominent resonance lines would be produced in the spectrum . in their work , two intense lines at 258.2  and 365.3  have been assigned to the @xmath9 transition .",
    "their decisions were based on the agreement with their theoretical calculations , high intensities of lines in the spectra and dependence of line intensities on the electron beam energies .",
    "theoretical analysis has been performed in single - configuration approximation using cowan code @xcite where quasirelativistic hartree - fock technique based on schrodinger equation is adopted taking into account the most important one - electron corrections ( mass - velocity and darwin ) .",
    "later the detailed investigation of transitions for @xmath0 ion employing relativistic multireference many - body perturbation theory has been performed in @xcite .",
    "the calculations presented therein showed that ground state of the ion corresponds to the @xmath11 configuration and it does not coincide with earlier predictions obtained from quasirelativistic calculations @xcite that pm - like ions with a nuclear charge @xmath12 larger than 73 have alkali - metal structure with a ground configuration of @xmath13 .",
    "pm - like @xmath14 spectra simulated using collisional - radiative model for low density conditions did not help to identify the observed lines in the experimental spectra @xcite .",
    "vilkas et al @xcite stressed that their study does not show one or two dominant resonance lines in the spectra .",
    "thus , the situation with the interpretation of the lines from the ebit plasma spectra corresponding to the radiative transitions in @xmath0 ion was named as class of _ unsolved mysteries _ @xcite .",
    "intensity of spectral lines is determined by equation : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the population of level @xmath17 ; @xmath18 - probability of radiative transition from level @xmath17 to level @xmath19 .",
    "electron impact excitation takes place in the electron beam while the cascade emission occurs outside it .",
    "the initial population of the excited levels when ions leave the beam region can be found analyzing excitation from the ground and metastable levels within coronal approximation framework .",
    "for this , energy levels , radiative transition probabilities and excitation rates have to be calculated .",
    "flexible atomic code @xcite was employed to obtain energy levels and radiative transition probabilities in @xmath0 using configuration interaction ( ci ) method .",
