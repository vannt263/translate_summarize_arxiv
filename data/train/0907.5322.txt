    "reconstruction methods with edge - preserving or -enhancing properties are widely studied topic in deterministic inverse problems .",
    "there exists a variety of different sophisticated approaches in the literature including functional regularization ( e.g. , the total variation approach @xcite ) or geometrical methods ( e.g. , the level set methods @xcite ) . in the bayesian inversion theory some methods have been introduced aiming for an edge - preserving point estimate in the finite - dimensional setting @xcite .",
    "especially the work by calvetti and somersalo @xcite with hierarchical priors is closely related to this paper . in general",
    "it seems to be difficult to establish how the posterior distribution behaves asymptotically , i.e. , as discretization of the problem gets finer .",
    "this is due to the fact that such methods usually require non - gaussian prior modeling and the related infinite - dimensional bayesian theory is not fully developed .",
    "this paper introduces a novel hierarchical structure leading to non - gaussian prior modeling for signal segmenting problems .",
    "we show that the limiting behavior of our model can be analyzed .",
    "let us discuss the current perspectives in bayesian modeling . consider a linear inverse problem @xmath6 where @xmath1 is the object of interest , @xmath4 a noise and @xmath7 the measured data on some function spaces . in the bayesian inversion these quantities",
    "are modeled as random variables and their probability distributions depict all information available prior to the measurement . with this information",
    "the goal is to make statistical inference on @xmath1 given the model equation and a realization @xmath8 of @xmath7 .",
    "sometimes the prior distribution of the object of interest @xmath1 depends on an unknown parameter which then becomes part of the modeling and inference problem .",
    "such prior structures are often referred to as _",
    "hierarchical models_.    in practice the measurement is often produced by some finite - dimensional projection @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , one also has to discretize @xmath1 for computational purposes .",
    "this yields the _ computational model _ @xmath10",
    "notice the two independent discretization levels @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "solving the inverse problem with the bayesian approach requires two steps : first , one translates all a priori information into the probability distributions of @xmath13 and the noise @xmath14 . the _ posterior probability _ @xmath15 ,",
    "i.e. , the probability distribution of @xmath13 conditioned on the measurement @xmath16 , is then obtained by using the bayes formula and equation .",
    "usually the ultimate goal is to compute some information , e.g. , point or spread estimates , from the posterior distribution .",
    "a point estimate that we discuss frequently in this paper is the _ conditional mean _ ( cm ) estimate which can be written for equation in euclidian spaces @xmath17 and @xmath18 as @xmath19 now a natural question follows : what happens to the reconstructed information if @xmath13 or @xmath20 is modeled on finer discretization , i.e. , with a bigger @xmath11 or @xmath12 ?",
    "moreover , do the posterior probability distributions converge and how to guarantee that the reconstructed objects stay stable ( e.g. , cm estimate converges ) as @xmath11 and @xmath12 increase ?",
    "the interplay between solutions of problems and in general situations is not fully understood .",
    "however , some partial results exist .",
    "in fact , if @xmath13 and @xmath20 are obtained by projections from gaussian distributions the convergence of posterior distribution has been proved in very general setting by lasanen in @xcite . to the author",
    "s knowledge only convergence studies with non - gaussian posterior distribution have been done from this point of view recently in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these first positive results show some general conditions for obtaining weakly converging posterior distributions and in addition converging cm estimates .",
    "we emphasize that these results require gaussian noise distribution .",
    "yet another non - trivial question is how to make sure that the crucial statistical properties of posterior distribution are not lost asymptotically ?",
    "this is highly relevant to the edge - preserveness discussed above .",
    "namely , in @xcite it was shown that the usual modeling of tv prior carries an unpleasant defect such that the edge - preserving property is lost from the cm reconstructions as dimensionality of the problem increases .",
    "the reason behind this is that under different parameterization the prior distribution either converges to a gaussian smoothness prior or diverges . in @xcite",
    "a non - gaussian prior structure is proposed for edge - preserving cm estimates .",
    "the estimates @xmath21 are shown to converge to so - called _ reconstructors _ that generalize the concept of cm estimates in infinite - dimensional spaces .",
    "we discuss this in more details later .",
    "the work by piiroinen in @xcite contains results about the existence of a discretization leading to converging posterior information in general non - gaussian setting .",
    "let us now review other related literature on the topic .",
    "first results on the bayesian inversion in infinite - dimensional function spaces were introduced in @xcite by franklin .",
    "this research has then been continued and generalized by mandelbaum @xcite , lehtinen , pivrinta and somersalo @xcite , fitzpatrick @xcite , and luschgy @xcite .",
    "lastly , we want to stress that the convergence of posterior distributions has also been studied from different perspectives .",
    "namely , in @xcite such convergence is studied when the objective information becomes more accurate .",
    "also , model reduction problems are considered in @xcite . for a general presentation on the bayesian inverse problems theory and computation",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the topic of probability theory in banach spaces is covered in @xcite .    this paper studies the problem of edge - preserving reconstructions in signal restoration problems with the emphasis on how to locate discontinuities . for technical reasons we concentrate on periodic signals , i.e. , the domain for our study is a 1-dimensional sphere @xmath2 .",
    "we model our prior beliefs of the unknown signal @xmath22 with a hierarchical structure @xmath23 where the auxiliary random variable @xmath24 models how the discontinuities are distributed .",
    "the conditional distribution of @xmath1 given a sample of @xmath24 then models our prior information about @xmath22 if we know where the discontinuities are located .",
    "such bayesian modeling has close connection to previous hierarchical segmentation methods @xcite .",
    "the method draws also a lot of inspiration from the celebrated mumford ",
    "shah image segmentation method @xcite and its variational approximation introduced by ambrosio and tortorelli @xcite .",
    "in this paper we introduce a finite - dimensional prior structure @xmath25 that produces a weakly converging posterior structure in the presence of a gaussian noise .",
    "the main theoretical results concerning the prior can be divided into three parts :    * there exists a well - defined random variable @xmath26 to which @xmath25 converges in distribution . * the posterior distributions @xmath27",
    "converge weakly in @xmath28 assuming that the measurements converge .",
    "* the cm estimate @xmath29 converges to reconstructors of problem .",
    "in addition we improve the results in @xcite concerning the general theory .",
    "we implement our method in practice and include some numerical examples with computer generated data .",
    "the connection of maximum a posteriori ( map ) estimates to ambrosio - tortorelli minimizers that was presented in @xcite is not studied here .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce relevant concepts and main results concerning the general theory .",
    "the infinite - dimensional hierarchical prior model @xmath23 in @xmath28 is defined in section 3 .",
    "we carefully show that such a construction is well - defined .",
    "discretized prior distributions for @xmath25 are constructed in section 4 .",
    "it is important to note that we can explicitly write down the related density functions .",
    "this becomes highly valuable in numerical implementation as no more approximations need to be made .",
    "section 5 is divided into three parts .",
    "first the theorems of section 2 are proved .",
    "secondly , we show here that @xmath25 converges to @xmath23 in distribution on @xmath28 .",
    "we conclude section 5 by showing the important property of uniformly finite exponential moments for the introduced prior structure .",
    "finally in section 6 we illustrate with numerical examples how our method works in practice .",
    "next we define problem rigorously . in order to do so",
    "let us introduce some notations .",
