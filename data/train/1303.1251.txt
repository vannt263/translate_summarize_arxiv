    "impulsive sep events , as characterized by enhanced @xmath4he , heavy ions and electrons and high charge states , are attributed to impulsive solar flares .",
    "the solar sources of impulsive sep events are identified with coronal jets and narrow cmes @xcite .",

    "some authors have made statistical argument questioning the importance of cme interaction for sep production @xcite . however",

    "intense storms can also occur when the sheath region between the icme and the shock has southward component of the magnetic field .",

    "on january 23 , 2012 three solar flares ( c2.5 , m1.1 and m8.7 ) occurred , and the last two were associated with two major cmes .",
    "the time line of the whole event is presented in table  1 .",
    "the upper panel of fig .",
    "1 shows the white light image and magnetogram of active region ar 11402 , which is the source region of the eruptions .",
    "the active region was located at @xmath0 n28 w36 , and had a simple @xmath7 magnetic field configuration .",

    "the soft x - ray flux shows three flares ( indicated by the arrows ) : first flare ( c2.5 ) peaked around 01:44 ut , the second flare ( m1.1 ) around 03:13 ut and the third one ( m8.7 ) around 03:59 ut . since all three flares occurred in quick succession , it was not possible to determine the exact onset time of the m1.1 and m8.7 flares .",
    "for the onset of the m1.1 flare we have used the time of the dip between the c2.5 and m1.1 flares . for the onset time of the m8.7 flare",
    "we have used the time when the d@xmath10/d@xmath11 turns positive ( i is the soft x - ray intensity of the flare ) .",
    "the m1.1 and m8.7 are each associated with a cme . the second cme is associated with large filament eruption . in the upcoming subsections we discuss the details on the flares , associated cmes and their interplanetary consequences .",

    "the three columns show the images during the rise , maximum and the decay phase respectively .",
    "it is clear from the observations that the flare starts with two bright sources in 304   wavelength ; one lies near the sunspot and other away from the sunspot .",

    "these sources lie over the bright kernels of the flare , which are part of the flare ribbons .",
    "post flare loops connecting the flare ribbons have been observed in aia 171 and 94   images around 03:29 ut ( figs .",
    "2f and 2i ) .",
    "the m1.1 flare was associated with the first cme .",
    "the cme has an extended hot core ( @xmath126.3 mk ) which will be discussed later .",
    "the long duration m8.7 flare starts with the eruption of the northern part of the active region filament .",

    "the filament shows slow rise with an average speed of @xmath06 km s@xmath1 between 03:00 - 03:31 ut followed by a fast rise with an asymptotic speed of @xmath0590 km s@xmath1 during 03:40 - 03:46 ut . the average speed calculated from images in fig .",
    "3(d - f ) is @xmath13280 km s@xmath1 , consistent with speed derived form sdo / aia observations of the filament corrected for projection effects during 03:26 ut to 03:46 ut .",

    "the flare ribbons and loops can also be seen in gong and aries h@xmath6 images ( fig .",
    "5 ) . in summary , both the m1.1 and m8.7 flares show typical flare arcades .",
    "the filament eruption is clear in the m8.7 flare , whereas in the m1.1 flare there was a hot ejecta which became the cme core in coronagraphic images ( see details below ) .",
    "the m1.1 and m8.7 flares were accompanied by cmes observed by soho and stereo coronagraphs .",
    "stereo b and a were located at -114 degrees and + 108 degrees , respectively relative to earth .",
    "stereo - a cor1 and cor2 observed the two cmes above the north - east limb .",
    "we used stereo a data for height - time measurements , since the cmes were limb events in stereo - a view ( less projection effects ) .",
    "6(a - c ) show the two cmes ( cme1 and cme2 ) from stereo - a cor1 and euvi 195   at 03:05 ut , 03:45 ut and 03:50 ut . we were able to image the cmes in their early phase because of the extended fov of stereo cor1 ( 1.4 - 4 r@xmath14 ) .",
    "the height time plots of the cmes obtained using stereo - a cor1 and cor2 data give speeds of cme1 and cme2 as @xmath01400 km s@xmath1 and @xmath02000 km s@xmath1 , respectively ( fig .",
    "the cmes occurred in quick succession : cme2 entered into the aftermath of cme1 at the first appearance of cme2 ( fig .",
    "the cme interaction took place due to the difference in speed , their origin from the same active region and their propagation in roughly the same direction . the interaction completed at a height of 11 - 12 @xmath2 at @xmath13 04:48 ut ( fig .",
    "6 g ) .    a sequence of lasco c2 and c3 difference images in fig .  7 , shows the further evolution of the two cmes .",
    "cme1 appeared in the lasco c2 fov at @xmath1303:12 ut at a position angle of 329@xmath15 with a width of 221@xmath15 .",
    "the cme1 had a linear speed of 685 km s@xmath1 , which is much smaller than the speed estimated from the stereo measurements at lower heights .",
    "this is likely to be due to projection effects because the solar source at n28 w36 in earth view , whereas the source was at the limb in stereo - a view .",
    "cme1 had an extended core ( see fig .",
    "7b ) . in cor1",
    "fov the core was also seen as a bright feature , which can be traced in euv images as a hot ejecta .",
    "this is somewhat unusual because normally the cme core is a cooler filament .",
    "8a shows the hot ejecta ( dotted line ) in the aia 94   image at 02:22 ut . the hot ejecta was surrounded by cme1 ( solid line ) as can be seen in the aia 193   difference image .",
    "this can also be seen in the stereo - a euvi 195   image at 02:35:30 ut ( fig .",
    "cme2 appeared at a height of 2.01 @xmath2 in the cor1 fov at around 03:40 ut . at this time , the leading edge of the cme1 was at 5 @xmath2 .",
    "when cme2 appeared in the lasco / c2 fov at 04:00 ut its leading edge had already reached the core of cme1 ( core1 ) ( see fig .",
    "the linear speed of cme2 was @xmath02175 km s@xmath1 in the lasco fov , which is comparable to the stereo - a speed ( the speed difference is within measurement error ) .",
    "the lasco cme also seems to be closer to the sky plane .",
    "7(c - f ) shows that the two cmes merged at 04:12 ut and thereafter moved out as a single compound cme .",
    "this can also be seen in the three frames of stereo - a cor2 shown in fig .",
    "6(d - f ) .",
    "even though a metric type ii bursts was not reported in the solar geophysical data our examination of the dynamic spectrum from the hiras radio spectrograph , shows a type ii burst feature between 03:40 and 03:50 ut .",
    "given the high speed of cme2 it is unusual that the type ii feature is very weak .",
    "this may be due to the fact that cme2 is running into the moving material of cme1 making it difficult to form a strong shock .",
    "furthermore , the starting frequency of the type ii burst was at 200 mhz . assuming that the radio emission is at harmonic of the local plasma frequency , we see that the 200 mhz plasma level is at an unusually large height of 2.0 @xmath2 .",
    "this may be due to the fact that the shock is formed in the body of cme1 .",
    "the interplanetary counterpart of the type ii burst can be seen in the wind / waves dynamic spectrum shown in fig .",
    ". an intense type iii burst , which is due to electrons accelerated at the flare site , can also be seen .",
    "the dh type ii burst stats around @xmath1304:00 ut , which is roughly the time the leading edge of cme2 reaches the core of cme1 ( fig .",
    "6 ( d - f ) and fig .  7(b ) ) .",
    "at this time the shock seems to have become very strong due to the decline of the alfven speed upstream of the shock .",
    "the type ii is observed as a broad band feature at lower frequencies ( fig .",
    "9(a - b ) ) .",
    "the same shock accelerated protons as indicated by the sep onset at @xmath1304:20 ut , which is about 40 minutes after the metric type ii start ( see fig .",
    "however , if we consider the fact that @xmath12100 mev protons take about 15 minutes to reach earth , the sep release at the sun is close to the onset of the dh type ii bursts . as noted before cme2 has already interacting with the hot core of cme1 .",
    "there is also a second increase in the sep intensity around 05:30 ut , which is right after the formation of compound cme .",
    "it is possible that some particles were trapped in the interaction region and released after the interaction ends . in the @xmath1610 mev channel ,",
    "the sep intensity reaches a plateau of about @xmath03000 pfu by 12:00 ut on january 23 , 2012 until the shock arrival at 1 au ( on january 24 , 2012 at 14:33 ut ) and causing an esp event ( see fig .",
    "the esp event attained a peak proton flux of @xmath06263 pfu at 15:30 ut on january 24 , 2012 .",
    "the sep event was the largest in solar cycle 24 @xcite as of this writing .    the formation of shock in the near - sun region ( as shown by the type ii radio emission ) and shock signatures observed at 1 au imply that the compound cme was able to drive a shock and accelerate particles in the entire sun - earth distance . from the onset of cme2 in cor1 fov (",
    "i.e. , 03:40 ut on january 23 , 2012 ) to the shock arrival at 1 au ( @xmath1314:33 ut on january 24 , 2012 ) , we see that the shock transit time is @xmath035 hour .",
    "10 shows interplanetary scintillation ( ips ) data of the cme event on january 23 , 2012 observed by the ort .",
    "the ips technique provides information on the turbulent plasma at the front of the moving cme .",
    "the ips observations describe the evolution of the compound cme beyond 50 r@xmath14 . in the ips fov , between 100 and 225 @xmath2 ,",
    "the cme decelerates from @xmath0900 to @xmath0700 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the cme deceleration is mostly due to the interaction with the background solar wind flow .",
    "11 shows the variation of interplanetary field parameters ( total magnetic field ( b ) , z component of magnetic field ( bz ) , electric field ( ey ) ) , plasma parameters ( solar wind speed ( v ) , proton density ( n ) , proton temperature ( t ) , plasma beta ( @xmath7 ) ) and dst index .",
    "the shock arrival is at @xmath014:33 ut on january 24 , 2012 , which is followed by an extended sheath and a narrow interval of icme material .",
    "the shock speed ( @xmath13700 km s@xmath1 ) is consistent with the speed derived from ips observations .",
    "the plasma beta and magnetic field plots do not show the classical signatures of a magnetic cloud .",
    "the narrow icme suggests that its impact on earth is at an angle rather than direct .",
    "the dst index shows that the icme resulted in a moderate gms ( dst @xmath13 -73 nt ) .",
    "a peak negative dst of -73 nt was reached at @xmath011:00 ut on january 25 , 2012 which corresponds to the main phase of the moderate gms .",
    "actually there are two dips in dst indicating two different interactions with the earth magnetic field . first is due to the interaction of the sheath region with negative bz with earth s magnetic field ; the second one is due to the negative bz within the icme .",
    "in this paper we presented the case study of the january 23 , 2012 solar eruptions from noaa ar 11402 ( n28 w36 ) that resulted in a large sep event and a moderate gms .",
    "the eruptions consisted of two fast interacting cmes associated with m1.1 and m8.7 flares . we have shown that the interaction of the fast primary cme with the preceding cme resulted in the huge sep event .",
    "the results presented in this study are consistent with the earlier suggestions that the interaction between cmes has important implications for large sep events @xcite .",
    "the january 23 , 2012 events were observed by the stereo mission taking advantage of its extended fov much closer to the sun , capturing cme interaction in more detail .",
    "it is significant that the metric type ii burst was very weak but the interplanetary type ii burst was very intense .",
    "this may be attributed to different combinations of cme speed , alfven speed and the physical conditions of the ambient medium .",
    "the temporal coincidence of the cme interaction with the onset of the intense interplanetary type ii burst and the large sep event is significant and suggests the plausible increase in the efficiency of particle acceleration .",
    "one of the interesting features of these eruptions is the fact that the core of cme1 was unusually hot because it was observed only in the hot plasma images ( 94   and 193  ) .",
    "the temperature exceeded 6 mk which is a few times the average temperature of the corona .",
    "the sep event started when the shock of cme2 propagated through the hot ejecta .",
    "the particles in the hot plasma were already energized by virtue of the high temperature , which makes it easy for the shock to accelerate these particles .",
    "the cmes presented in this paper resulted in a huge sep event but not a strong gms .",
    "one of the possible causes for the moderate gms may be that only a small section ( about 6 hours ) of the icme interacted with earth .",
    "following the cme motion using movies of stereo cor2 images confirms that most of the compound cme propagated above the ecliptic .",
    "this is also seen in the stereo and lasco images in figs .  6 and 7 .",
    "in this paper we have described multi - wavelength observations of flares and cmes that are important in understanding how solar eruptions cause space weather .",
    "deeper insights into the link between the solar origin of cmes and their interplanetary and geo - space consequences can be obtained by a detailed modeling of cme initiation and propagation through extreme ambient conditions .",
    "+ the key results of this study can be summarized as follows : + 1 .",
    "this study demonstrated that interaction between fast cmes from the same active region can occur very close to the sun as revealed by stereo observations .",
    "the gms was of double - dip nature because the shock sheath and the icme contained negative bz values and caused the two dips in the dst index . +",

    "<S> we use multiwavelength data from space and ground based instruments to study the solar flares and coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) on january 23 , 2012 that were responsible for one of the largest solar energetic particle ( sep ) events of solar cycle 24 . </S>",
    "<S> the eruptions consisting of two fast cmes ( @xmath01400 km s@xmath1 and @xmath02000 km s@xmath1 ) and m - class flares that occurred in active region 11402 located at @xmath0n28 w36 . </S>",
    "<S> the two cmes occurred in quick successions , so they interacted very close to the sun . </S>",
    "<S> the second cme caught up with the first one at a distance of @xmath011 - 12 @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the cme interaction may be responsible for the elevated sep flux and significant changes in the intensity profile of the sep event . </S>",
    "<S> the compound cme resulted in a double - dip moderate geomagnetic storm ( @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the two dips are due to the southward component of the interplanetary magnetic field in the shock sheath and the icme intervals . </S>",
    "<S> one possible reason for the lack of a stronger geomagnetic storm may be that the icme delivered a glancing blow to earth .    </S>",
