    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) materials present some fascinating challenges to condensed - matter theory , with even the most simple 2d systems harboring surprises .",
    "one of the most famous problems involves the precise description of melting in 2d solids made up of hard , disk - like particles with short - range repulsive interactions.@xcite specifically , does the fluid undergo a weak first - order transition to the solid , or is there an intermediate hexatic phase linked by two continuous phase transitions ? related avenues of research concern the existence of exotic phases in systems made up of more complex particles , such as ( non)periodic solids of hard - disk dimers,@xcite pentamers and hexamers,@xcite tetratic phases of hard squares@xcite and hard rectangles,@xcite and orientationally ordered solids of hard pentagons and heptagons.@xcite the effects of additional interactions on the phase behavior and dynamics of 2d systems are also of interest , as evidenced by recent studies on dipolar potentials in the context of magnetic colloids.@xcite such models provide an ideal testing ground for condensed - matter theories , and in some cases challenge our most fundamental understanding of the properties of matter .    despite their simplicity",
    ", 2d models can provide reliable descriptions of some real , and rather complex , experimental situations .",
    "for example , in a number of recent studies , 2d models have been employed to help interpret and understand the clustering and crystallization of proteins at interfaces .",
    "the conformations and interactions of proteins are central to biological activity , and ideally one would like to investigate these properties _ in vivo_. unfortunately , structural information is most commonly obtained from x - ray diffraction studies on crystals .",
    "there is a class of proteins , however , that can be studied under conditions resembling those _ in vivo_. membrane proteins constitute a large class of molecules found within the lipid bilayers that constitute cell walls .",
    "they fulfill a variety of roles , such as controlling the selective transport of ions and molecules across cell membranes , or providing binding sites for other molecules on to the membrane .",
    "the structures of membrane proteins can be studied by deposition on to a surface , alongside lipids , to form either low surface - coverages or 2d crystals ; the hydrophobic lipids help to mimic the interior of the membrane .",
    "electron microscopy or atomic - force microscopy can then be used to image directly the clustering and packing of proteins at the solid - air interface.@xcite in many cases , the ordering of proteins can be rationalized on the basis of their gross shapes ( the way in which those shapes would ` tile the plane ' ) and the presence of specific binding interactions between domains on different molecules .",
    "for example , the surface structure of bacteriorhodopsin ( a transmembrane protein ) is comprised of a close - packed array of trimers , each made up of monomers that resemble @xmath0 sectors of a circle .",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of hard sectors  with an additional attractive square - well potential to mimic specific binding interactions ",
    "yield insight on the self - assembly and subsequent crystallization processes.@xcite in another application , the ordering in 2d crystals of annexin v  another ` triangular ' membrane protein  was reproduced in simulations of a hard - disk model decorated with an appropriate orientation - dependent potential to mimic the locations of the specific binding sites on the protein . experimentally observed honeycomb and triangular structures were captured by the molecular model .",
    "these examples show that the basic physics of large - scale structural order in 2d protein crystals can be studied with simple models , and without resorting to atomistically detailed  and hence very expensive  computer simulations",
    ".    there are a large number of proteins which are either inherently triangular in shape , or otherwise form trimeric structures .",
    "for example , rotavirus inner capsid protein v6 forms trimers resembling equililateral triangles , which pack in 2d crystals ( space group @xmath1).@xcite specific fragments of prion proteins found _ in vivo _ form trimeric units that crystallize in to a 2d structure ( space group @xmath2).@xcite finally , we highlight an example in which a membrane fusion protein ( from the semiliki forest virus ) is seen to form pentagons of trimers , with the center of the pentagon raised slightly out of the plane.@xcite some semblance of local five - fold coordination can also been seen in teta  a roughly triangular transporter protein  at moderate surface coverages.@xcite    motivated by the diversity of 2d crystal structures exhibited by trimeric protein units , and also by the observation of five - fold coordination,@xcite we have investigated the structure and phase behavior of model trimeric molecules made up of hard disks . in order to mimic specific binding interactions , such as those that might give rise to local five - fold coordination , we focus on an equililateral triangle of three hard disks at contact , in which one disk can interact with the corresponding disks on other molecules _ via _ a short - range attractive square - well potential .",
    "as we will show below , this raises the possibility of generating orientational order within simple close - packed structures , and also offers the opportunity of forming clusters at low surface coverages . using mc simulations ,",
    "we map out the phase diagram of the model system , and characterize the structures of the low - density clustered fluid and high - density solids which are formed at low temperature .",
    "the remainder of the article is organized as follows . in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we describe the molecular model , and summarize the simulation methods .",
    "the results are presented in section [ sec : results ] , and section [ sec : discussion ] concludes the paper .",
    "the molecular model consists of three hard disks , each of diameter @xmath3 , fused at mutual contact to form an equilateral triangle .",
    "two of the disks on each molecule are purely repulsive , and interact with all other disks in the system through the potential @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the separation between the centers of two disks .",
    "the third disk on each molecule carries a central attractive interaction site ; these ` attractive ' disks interact with each other _ via _ the potential @xmath6 where @xmath7 controls the range of the attraction .",
    "this potential crudely mimics an effective attraction between vertices of the molecular triangles , which might arise through specific interactions ( e.g. hydrogen bonding , disulfide bridges , effective solvophobic interactions ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath8 will clearly have a crucial role to play in the thermodynamics of the system .",
    "if @xmath9 then one should anticipate a conventional phase diagram containing a vapor - liquid transition , and a fluid - solid transition .",
    "the orientation of a trimer can be defined by a vector @xmath10 joining the geometrical center of the trimer with the center of the attractive disk .",
    "it is unlikely that there would be any periodic orientational ordering of @xmath10 in the solid phase ; if two trimers can interact favorably irrespective of the mutual orientation , then on entropy grounds the orientations will be disordered . in the opposite extreme , @xmath11",
    ", the molecules will feel the orientation dependence of the net trimer - trimer potential , and ultimately we might expect the vapor - liquid transition to disappear from the equilibrium phase diagram . indeed , in a pure square - well hard - sphere fluid , condensation becomes metastable with respect to freezing when @xmath12.@xcite in the present case , an interaction range @xmath13 guarantees that attractive sites must face each other directly in order to interact ; when @xmath14 it is possible for an attractive disk to be within interaction range of a trimer even if it approaches from ` behind ' . with these comments in mind",
    ", we have chosen to study a system with @xmath15 .",
    "the ratio of @xmath16 to the ( angle - averaged ) diameter of the trimer is smaller than that in a pure square - well hard - sphere system with the same value of @xmath8 , and assuming some sort of correspondence between two and three - dimensional systems , we do not anticipate there being a vapor - liquid transition in the equilibrium phase diagram . on the other hand , because the trimers have to attain quite specific mutual orientations in order to interact favorably ( since @xmath13 ) , we should expect to see some sort of non - trivial structure in fluid and solid phases at low temperatures .",
    "systems of @xmath17 trimers were studied using mc simulations either in the isothermal - isobaric ( @xmath18 ) ensemble or the canonical ( @xmath19 ) ensemble.@xcite the simulation cell was rectangular with dimensions @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and area @xmath22 .",
    "each mc cycle consisted of one translational trial move and one orientational trial move for each of @xmath23 randomly selected molecules . to help equilibrate dense phases ,",
    "every fifth mc cycle included @xmath23 trial moves in which a randomly selected trimer was rotated by @xmath24 . in @xmath18 simulations of solid phases ,",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 were varied independently ; in @xmath18 simulations of fluid phases , the simulation cell was constrained to be square . for most thermodynamic state points",
    "typical equilibration runs consisted of @xmath25 mc cycles , but some points ( close to phase transitions ) required @xmath26 mc cycles .",
    "production runs were typically @xmath25 mc cycles .",
    "we define the following dimensionless units in terms of the square - well depth , @xmath27 , and the hard - disk diameter , @xmath3 : number density @xmath28 ; temperature @xmath29 ; pressure @xmath30 .",

    "[ fig : phasediag ] . before detailing the determination of the phase boundaries , the characteristics of the different phases will be described .",

    "figure [ fig : snapshot](b ) shows both the lack of orientational order , and the registry between alternating rows .",
    "notice the black bonds showing how the disks are connected within the trimers ; we call this an ` @xmath36 ' structure to denote the alternating alignment of the rows .",
    "the close - packed rows resemble those formed by vp6,@xcite although the registry between the rows is different . at the end of this section",
    ", we will briefly discuss the possibility of solids with other close - packed structures .    at low temperature and low density",
    "we find a highly associated fluid ( fluid ii ) , in which the attractive disks aggregate to form distinct clusters .",
    "a typical configuration is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : snapshot](c ) , which exhibits a broad distribution of cluster sizes . to identify clusters",
    ", we employ the obvious criterion that two trimers with attractive disks within interaction range belong to the same cluster . with this definition in mind ,",
    "[ fig : snapshot](c ) shows that , in general , the attractive disks within the clusters form close - packed motifs , rather than loose arrangements of disks on the circumference of a ring . for clusters of three trimers",
    "there is no distinction , whereas for four or more trimers the close - packed arrangement is more favorable ; in a ring , each disk would have two nearest neighbors , whereas close - packed motifs can accommodate more than two direct contacts . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cluster ] we show the probability distribution function of clusters containing @xmath37 molecules , at different pressures along an isotherm with @xmath38 . as the pressure and density increase , the distributions show peaks at progressively higher values of @xmath37 .",

    "@xmath39 , fig .",
    "[ fig : cluster](e )  the most probable cluster size is @xmath40 .",
    "we had hoped that these clusters would adopt a pentagonal structure , but instead the attractive disks form ` olympic rings ' motifs , such as those shown in fig .",

    "the maximum disk - disk separation in a perfect pentagon of disks is @xmath41 , which is longer than the range of the potential studied in this work .",

    "perhaps pentagonal clusters would be formed in a system with @xmath42 ? ( the upper limit means that there can be no other disks between two interacting attractive disks . )",
    "we did some test runs in the fluid phase with @xmath43 , but no pentagonal clusters were observed .",
    "if anything , fewer distinct clusters were in evidence as compared to @xmath15 , presumably because it is less crucial that the trimers attain a specific mutual orientation in order to interact .",

    "[ fig : snapshot](d ) .",
    "this clearly shows a predominance of @xmath55 clusters , with the attractive disks close packed to form a parallelogram motif , but the clusters are not yet fully packed in to a solid structure .",
    "this process is completed upon further compression , to form a @xmath56 periodic solid ( solid ii ) , a defective example of which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : snapshot](e ) . in simulations of the high - density solid ii phase , the initial configuration consisted of the appropriate @xmath36 structure , but",

    "the primary peak is at @xmath55 , but the presence of defects  such as those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : snapshot](e )  gives rise to smaller ` clusters ' of attractive disks .",
    "the fluid - solid phase boundaries were located by monitoring the equation of state @xmath57 along selected isotherms in @xmath18 simulations . for each isotherm ,",
    "two sets of simulations were performed : a compression branch , starting from a low - density fluid configuration ; and an expansion branch , starting from the perfect solid structure corresponding to that found in the compression branch at high pressure .",
    "portions of two representative examples ( @xmath38 and @xmath58 ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eos ] . of course",
    ", the fluid equations of state extend to much lower densities , but these exhibit entirely conventional behavior and hence are not shown ; in particular , there is no sign of a ` van der waals ' loop which would indicate a vapor - liquid phase transition .",
    "the main features of interest are the apparent discontinuities in the density at what are assumed to be first - order phase transitions ( we will not open up the can of worms associated with the precise nature of two - dimensional melting and freezing ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : eos ] we indicate distinct fluid and solid branches in the equations of state , a number of putative metastable states ( as discussed above ) , and approximate tie - lines connecting the fluid and solid coexistence densities , obtained as follows .",
    "the fluid branch was fitted with a virial expansion containing terms up to @xmath59 , i.e. , @xmath60 , while the solid branch was found to be fitted rather well by a simple van der waals equation@xcite of the form @xmath61 , which contains a free - volume term arising from repulsive interactions , and a mean - field term arising from the attractions .",
    "the coexistence densities were then estimated by extrapolating the fitted branches of the equation of state to a pressure half way between those in the highest - density stable fluid and the lowest - density stable solid ; the metastable states were identified as those that did not fit on to either branch and/or for which the simulation configuration was clearly neither pure solid nor pure fluid , e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : snapshot](d ) .",
    "obviously this approach provides only very rough locations for the phase boundaries shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediag ] , but some general trends are nonetheless apparent . at very low temperatures ,",
    "the coexistence densities decrease as the system is cooled , and the transition appears to be getting weaker . at high temperatures ( @xmath62 )",
    "the fluid coexistence density ( @xmath63 ) is very similar to the density at which the pure hard - disk fluid undergoes its transition , either to a hexatic or a solid ( disk density @xmath64,@xcite ` trimer ' density @xmath65 ) .",
    "the apparent trimer solid coexistence density ( @xmath66 ) is significantly larger than the melting density of hard disks ( disk density @xmath67,@xcite ` trimer ' density @xmath68 ) .",

    "the statistical errors in the @xmath18 simulation points are smaller than the symbols . ]    the final piece of the equilibrium phase diagram concerns the crossover from high - temperature orientationally disordered states to low - temperature states that possess structural motifs arising from the clustering of the attractive disks . to delineate the boundary between these two regimes ,",
    "we calculated the heat capacity appropriate to the statistical mechanical ensemble being sampled . in general",
    "we used @xmath18 simulations to measure @xmath70  where @xmath71 is the enthalpy ( minus the kinetic contribution )  as a function of temperature along an isobar .",
    "since clustering must be accompanied by a drop in the configurational energy , and enthalpy , a peak in @xmath72 would seem to be an obvious signal of a crossover from unclustered to clustered states . in simulations we evaluated the usual fluctuation formula , @xmath73/k_{b}t^{2}$ ] , and , as a check ,",

    "in general the peak height is less pronounced at high densities , mainly due to the fact that even in the high - temperature phase there must be some attractive disks within interaction range due to the confinement .",
    "thus , the most difficult situation obtains at close packing of the trimers , @xmath77 . in this case",

    "it appears that the two branches would meet up somewhere in the fluid - solid coexistence region .",
    "we stress that the boundaries indicated do not represent thermodynamic phase transitions ; rather , they separate different regimes of trimer association .    finally , we briefly consider the possibility of the trimer system adopting other solid structures , such as the @xmath56 @xmath69 structure shown in fig .",

    "hence , the minimum configurational energy for an @xmath69 solid is @xmath84 per trimer . in the @xmath36 structure , there are six attractive disks per parallelogram motif , of which two have two neighbors , two have three neighbors , and two have four neighbors , giving a minimum energy of @xmath85 per trimer . hence , on energetic grounds , we should expect the @xmath36 structure to be thermodynamically favored . even at high temperature",

    "indeed , we only ever observed the fluid spontaneously freezing in to an @xmath36 structure .",
    "although we have not performed free - energy calculations , it would be very surprising if an entropic effect could compensate for the relative energetic and mechanical stability of the @xmath36 phase with respect to the @xmath69 phase .    another possible close - packed structure",

    "in this article we have described the structure and phase behavior of a generic model of trimeric molecules , largely motivated by recent experimental 2d microscopy studies of clustering and crystallization in triangular proteins and protein trimers .",
    "the molecular model consists of a triangle of hard disks , with one of the disks participating in attractive square - well interactions with similar disks on other trimers .",
    "the range of the square - well potential , @xmath16 , was @xmath88 times the disk diameter .",

    "to investigate the formation of such clusters further , it might be interesting to study a system of hard isosceles triangles with the unique angle equal to @xmath89 , and a short - range attraction operating between the corresponding vertices .",
    "in the low - temperature solid , the basic structural motif consists of clusters of six molecules , with the attractive disks close - packed to form a parallelogram .",
    "a metastable solid possessing a motif made up of four molecules was also identified .",
    "the fundamental difference between the two situations is the registry between neighboring close - packed rows of trimers ( @xmath36 versus @xmath69 ) . even at high temperatures ,",
