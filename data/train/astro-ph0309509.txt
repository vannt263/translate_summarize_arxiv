    "as widely discussed in many papers , the spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) carries unique informations on physical processes occurring during early cosmic epochs ( see e.g. danese & burigana 1993 and references therein ) .",
    "the comparison between models of cmb spectral distortions and cmb absolute temperature measures can constrain the physical parameters of the considered dissipation processes . by jointly considering distortions generated in a wide range of early or intermediate cosmic epochs and at late cosmic epochs , we recently discussed the implications of the current cmb spectrum data ( salvaterra & burigana 2002 ) as well as the great improvements in the knowledge of dissipation processes , in particular on those possibly occurred at early and intermediate epochs , achievable with a significant progress in the experiments at long wavelength , @xmath6  cm , ( burigana & salvaterra 2003 ) , such that expected from a _ dimes_-like project ( kogut 1996 , 2003 ) .",
    "fixsen & mather ( 2002 ) recently proposed a new generation of millimeter and submillimeter spectrum experiment , firas  ii , aimed to improve by a factor @xmath11 the accuracy of the cobe / firas measures .    while in the last decade many efforts have been   ( see e.g. bennett et al .",
    "1996 , 2003 and references therein ) and are currently   ( see e.g. mandolesi et al .",
    "1998 , puget et al .",
    "1998 , tauber 2000 and references therein ) dedicated to greatly improve our knowledge of the whole sky cmb anisotropies since their cobe / dmr discovery ( smoot et al . 1992 ) , the combination of high precision and large frequency coverage jointly forseen for _ dimes _ and firas  ii opens a completely new perspective also in cmb spectrum studies , as we will discuss in this paper .    in section  2",
    "we briefly summarize the general properties of the cmb spectral distortions and the main physical informations that can be derived from the comparison with the observations . in section  3",
    "we briefly report on the performances forseen for the _ dimes _ and firas  ii experiments and describe the generation of the simulated observations used in this work .",
    "the implications of such experiments for our knowledge of the thermal history of the universe are presented in section  4 : models including an undistorted spectrum and distorted spectra in the case of a single kind of spectral distortion or by jointly considering three kinds of spectral distortions are compared with data simulated according to the sensitivities quoted for the above experiments ( the joint analysis of two spectral distortions is reported in appendix  a for completeness ) .",
    "section  5 is dedicated to a comparison between some different classes of astrophysical and particle processes recently discussed in the literature occurring at relatively late epochs , able to distort the spectrum at different wavelength regions , and , possibly , to significantly contribute to the reionization of the universe .",
    "finally , we discuss the results and draw our main conclusions in section  6 .",
    "the cmb spectrum emerges from the thermalization redshift , @xmath12 , with a shape very close to a planckian one , owing to the strict coupling between radiation and matter through compton scattering and photon production / absorption processes , radiative compton and bremsstrahlung , which were extremely efficient at early times and able to re - establish a blackbody ( bb ) spectrum from a perturbed one on timescales much shorter than the expansion time ( see e.g. danese & de  zotti 1977 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath13 ( burigana , danese & de  zotti 1991a ) depends on the baryon density ( in units of the critical density ) , @xmath14 , and the hubble constant , @xmath15 , through the product @xmath16 ( @xmath15 expressed in km / s / mpc ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "physical processes occurring at redshifts @xmath17 may lead imprints on the cmb spectrum .",
    "the timescale for the achievement of kinetic equilibrium between radiation and matter ( i.e. the relaxation time for the photon spectrum ) , @xmath18 , is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the photon ",
    "electron collision time , @xmath21 , @xmath22 being the electron temperature and @xmath23 ; @xmath24 is the mean fractional change of photon energy in a scattering of cool photons off hot electrons , i.e. @xmath25 ; @xmath26 is the present radiation temperature related to the present radiation energy density by @xmath27 ; a primordial helium abundance of 25% by mass is here assumed .",
    "it is useful to introduce the dimensionless time variable @xmath28 defined by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the present time and @xmath31 is the expansion time given by @xmath32^{-1/2 } \\sec \\ , , \\ ] ] @xmath33 being the redshift of equal non relativistic matter and photon energy densities ( @xmath34 is the density of non relativistic matter in units of critical density ) ; @xmath35 , @xmath36 being the number of relativistic , 2component , neutrino species ( for 3 species of massless neutrinos , @xmath37 ) , takes into account the contribution of relativistic neutrinos to the dynamics of the universe , is itself a function of the amount of energy dissipated .",
    "the effect , however , is never very important and is negligible for very small distortions . ] .",
    "burigana , de  zotti & danese 1991b have reported on numerical solutions of the kompaneets equation ( kompaneets 1956 ) for a wide range of values of the relevant parameters and accurate analytical representations of these numerical solutions , suggested in part by the general properties of the kompaneets equation and by its well known asymptotic solutions , have been found ( burigana , de  zotti & danese 1995 ) .",
    "the cmb distorted spectra depend on at least three main parameters : the fractional amount of energy exchanged between matter and radiation , @xmath38 , @xmath39 being the radiation energy density before the energy injection , the redshift @xmath40 at which the heating occurs , and the baryon density @xmath41 .",
    "the photon occupation number can be then expressed in the form @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the dimensionless frequency @xmath44 ( @xmath45 being the present frequency ) , and @xmath46 characterizes the epoch when the energy dissipation occurred , @xmath40 being the corresponding redshift ( we will refer to @xmath46 computed assuming @xmath47 , so that the epoch considered for the energy dissipation does not depend on the amount of released energy ) .",
    "the continuous behaviour of the distorted spectral shape with @xmath48 can be in principle used also to search for constraints on the epoch of the energy exchange . of course , by combining the approximations describing the distorted spectrum at early ( sunyaev & zeldovich 1970 ) and intermediate epochs with the comptonization distortion expression ( zeldovich & sunyaev 1969 ; zeldovich , illarionov & sunyaev 1972 ) describing late distortions , it is possible to jointly treat two heating processes ( see burigana et al .",
    "1995 and salvaterra & burigana 2002 and references therein for a more exhaustive discussion ) .    in this work simulated measures of the cmb absolute temperature are compared with the above models of distorted spectra by using a standard @xmath49 analysis .",
    "we determine the limits on the amount of energy possibly injected in the cosmic background at arbitrary primordial epochs corresponding to a redshift @xmath40 ( or equivalently to @xmath48 ) . this topic has been discussed in several works ( see e.g. burigana et al .",
    "1991b , nordberg & smoot 1998 , salvaterra & burigana 2002 ) .",
    "we apply here the method of comparison with the theoretical models described in salvaterra & burigana 2002 and burigana & salvaterra 2003 , by investigating the possibility of properly combining data simulated according to the _ dimes _ and firas  ii performances respectively at long and short wavelengths .",
    "we will consider the recent improvement in the calibration of the firas data , that sets the cmb scale temperature at @xmath50  k at 95 per cent confidence level ( cl ) ( mather et al .",
    "then , we study the combined effect of two different heating processes that may have distorted the cmb spectrum at different epochs .",
    "this hypothesis has been also taken into account by nordberg & smoot 1998 , who fit the observed data with a spectrum distorted by a single heating at @xmath51 , a second one at @xmath52 and by free - free emission , obtaining limits on the parameters that describe these processes .",
    "as in salvaterra & burigana 2002 , we extend their analysis by considering the full range of epochs for the early and intermediate energy injection process , by taking advantage of the analytical representation of spectral distortions at intermediate redshifts ( burigana et  al .",
    "long wavelength measures are particularly sensitive to the free - free distortion due to its well known dependence on the frequency . at moderately long wavelengths , where quite accurate observations can be carried out , @xmath53 . here",
    "@xmath54 is the ratio between the electron and radiation temperature before the beginning of the dissipation process , @xmath5 is the so called free - free distortion parameter ( burigana et al .",
    "1995 ) , and @xmath55 is the ( frequency dependent ) equivalent thermodynamic temperature . at very long wavelengths",
    "the equivalent thermodynamic temperature approaches the electron temperature because of the very high bremsstrahlung efficiency .",
    "the relationship between free - free distortion and comptonization distortion is highly model dependent , being related to the details of the thermal history at late epochs ( see e.g. danese & burigana 1993 , burigana et al .",
    "1995 ) , and can not be simply represented by integral parameters .    in the combined analysis of the implications of future cmb spectrum experiments for energy dissipations at different cosmic times and free - free distortions we avoid to physically link comptonization and free - free distortions .",
    "( 4 ) generalizes then to @xmath56    comptonization and free - free emission could be also produced in several astrophysical scenarios .",
    "for example , ionized halos in the early stages of galaxy formation ( oh 1999 ) can produce a relevant free - free distortions and coupled comptonization and free - free distortions can be produced in the reionization epoch , indicated by the _ wmap _ data ( kogut et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "it is also possible to extend the limits on @xmath3 for heatings occurred at @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the redshift corresponding to @xmath59 , when the compton scattering was able to restore the kinetic equilibrium between matter and radiation on timescales much shorter than the expansion time and the evolution on the cmb spectrum can be easily studied by replacing the full kompaneets equation with the differential equations for the evolution of the electron temperature and the chemical potential .",
    "this study can be performed by using the simple analytical expressions by burigana et al .",
    "1991b instead of numerical solutions .    to evaluate the scientific impact represented by the future experiment improvements , we create different data sets simulating the observation of a distorted and non distorted spectra from a space experiments like _ dimes _ and firas  ii through the method described in section  3.1 .",
    "each data set will be then compared to models of distorted spectra by using the method described in salvaterra & burigana 2002 ( see also burigana & salvaterra 2000 for the details of the code ) to recover the values of the parameters appearing in eq .  ( 5 ) . for simplicity ,",
    "we restrict to the case of a baryon density @xmath60 our analysis of the implications for the thermal history of the universe , but the method can be simply applied to different values of @xmath41 .",
    "the cmb spectrum experiments considered here are dedicated to improve our knowledge both at the same and at longer wavelengths with respect to the firas frequency coverage ( @xmath61  cm  @xmath62  cm ) .    as representative cases , and without the ambition to cover the whole set of planned experiments , we briefly refer here to the _ dimes _ experiment from space ( kogut 1996 ) designed to reach an accuracy close to that of firas up to @xmath63  cm and to the firas  ii experiment ( fixsen & mather 2002 ) which will allow a sensitivity improvement by a factor @xmath64 with respect to firas .",
    "_ dimes _   ( diffuse microwave emission survey ) is a space mission submitted to the nasa in 1995 , designed to measure very accurately the cmb spectrum at wavelengths in the range @xmath65  cm ( kogut 1996 ) .",
    "_ dimes _ will compare the spectrum of each 10 degree pixel on the sky to a precisely known blackbody to precision of @xmath66  mk , close to that of firas ( @xmath67  mk ) .",
    "the set of receivers is given from cryogenic radiometers with instrument emission cooled to 2.7  k operating at six frequency bands about 2 , 4 , 6 , 10 , 30 and 90  ghz using a single external blackbody calibration target common to all channels to minimize the calibration uncertainty .",
    "the _ dimes _ design is driven by the need to reduce or eliminate systematic errors from instrumental artifacts .",
    "the _ dimes _ sensitivity represents an improvement by a factor better than 300 with respect to previous measurements at cm wavelengths .",
    "fixsen & mather ( 2002 ) described the fundamental guidelines to significantly improve cmb spectrum measures at @xmath7  cm .",
    "a great reduction of the residual noise of cosmic rays , dominating the noise of the firas instrument , can be obtained by eliminating the data on - board co - add process or applying deglitching before co - adding , by reducing the size of the detectors and by using `` spiderweb '' bolometers or antenna - coupled microbolometers .",
    "they are expected to show a very low noise when cooled below 1  k while ruo sensors can reduce to 0.1  mk the read noise of thermometers .",
    "the lagrangian point l2 of the earth - sun system is , of course , the favourite `` site '' for firas  ii .",
    "also , the calibration can be improved by order or magnitudes with respect to that firas by reducing the contribution to the calibrator reflectance of light from the diffraction at the junction between the calibrator and the horn .",
    "a complete symmetrical construction of the instrument is recommended .",
    "this allows the cross - check between calibrators and between calibrators and the sky and to realize `` an end - to - end calibration and performance test before lunch '' .",
    "according to the authors , firas  ii can be designed to have a frequency coverage from 60 to 3600  ghz ( i.e. from 5  mm to 83  @xmath68 m ) with a spectral resolution @xmath69 and sensitivity in each channel about 100 times better than firas .",
    "we collect different data sets , simulating measurements of different cmb spectra , distorted or not , at the frequency ranges of the considered experiments . for the cases of distorted spectra",
    "we calculate the theoretical temperature of the cmb spectrum as discussed in the previous section . of course , the equivalent thermodynamic temperature held obviously constant at all the frequencies for the case of a non distorted spectrum .    the theoretical temperatures are then fouled to simulate real measurements affected by instrumental noise .",
    "the simulated temperature @xmath70 at the frequency @xmath45 is given by @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the theoretical temperature at the frequency @xmath45 and err(@xmath45 ) is the expected rms error ( at 1  @xmath73 ) of the experiment at this frequency .",
    "the numbers @xmath74 are a set of random numbers generated according to a gaussian distribution with null mean value and unit variance with the routine gasdev by press et al .",
    "1992 (  7 ) .",
    "the considered frequency channels are those of _",
    "dimes _ and those achievable with the spectral resolution forseen for firas  ii . for sake of simplicity and",
    "differently from the analysis carried out in salvaterra & burigana 2002 , we do not consider here the wavelength region at @xmath75 m , accessible to firas  ii , and neglect the problem of separating the signatures of cmb spectral distortions , dominant at @xmath6  mm , from the contribution from far - ir galaxies , dominant at @xmath76 m .",
    "we generate a set ( s - bb ) of simulated data in the case of a blackbody spectrum at a temperature of 2.725  k in order to evaluate the joint capability of two experiments like _ dimes _ and firas  ii to improve the constraints on the amount of the energy injected in the cosmic radiation field .",
    "the analysis of this case is in fact directly comparable with the results obtained from the fit to the currently available data .    of course",
    ", it is extremely important to evaluate the capability of so accurate experiments to detect and , possibly , precisely measure the spectral distortion parameters , the fractional energy exchanges and the dissipation epochs . to this aim",
    ", we generate other three sets of simulated data ( respectively , s - e5c , s - e1.5c , s - e0.1c ) assuming an instantaneous ( @xmath77 ) earlier energy dissipation with @xmath78 ( @xmath79 , where @xmath68 is the chemical potential of the bose - einstein ( be ) formula describing the high frequency tail of the spectrum for distortions at sufficiently high redshifts ) occurring at @xmath59 or at @xmath80 or at @xmath81 plus a later comptonization distortion associated to an energy dissipation @xmath82 ( here @xmath83 is the `` energy '' comptonization parameter ) . for simplicity , we assume here @xmath84 ( see sect .  5 for a discussion of combined comptonization and free - free distortions on the basis of some specific models ) .",
    "all these distorted spectra are computed by setting @xmath85 and @xmath86  km / s / mpc .",
    "these above simulated data set will be compared with models including spectral distortions generated by a dissipation process occurred at very different cosmic epochs , on a grid represented by the dimensionless time @xmath87 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 , 0.5 , 0.25 , 0.1 , 0.05 , 0.025 , 0.01 , and @xmath88 , plus / or a comptonization distortion , plus / or a free - free distortion , as described in sect .  2 , in order to analyse the quality of the recovery of the input parameters achievable with the considered experiments .",
    "we fit the simulated data set s - bb with a spectrum distorted by a single energy injection at different values of @xmath48 or by a free - free distortion in order to recover the value of @xmath3 or of @xmath5 , expected to be null , and the limits ( at 95 per cent of cl ) on them .",
    "the results are reported in table  1 for a representative set of the considered dissipation epochs .",
    "the table shows also the results obtained by using the firas data alone combined with the long wavelength data accumulated in the last two decades ( see also salvaterra & burigana 2002 ) , the results achievable by combining the firas data with the subset of the data set s - bb achievable by _ dimes _ alone ( see also burigana & salvaterra 2003 ) , and , finally , the results achievable by exploiting the subset of data set s - bb achievable by firas  ii alone .    the sensitivities reported in table  1 for a given distortion parameter apply in the case in which quite strong priors can be assumed on the other two distortion parameters . in any case , firas  ii alone or _",
    "dimes _ alone either is able to improve by more than one order of magnitude the current limits on the free - free distortions and on the energy exchanges .",
    "it is evident from the table that in this case firas  ii alone is able to provide the best constraints on the energy exchanges ( with a sensitivity improvement by a factor @xmath11 ) while _ dimes _ alone is able to provide the best constraints on the free - free distortions ( with a sensitivity improvement by a factor @xmath89 ) , without any significant improvement from the combination of the two experiments .",

    "we first consider the information achievable by combining _",
    "dimes _ and firas  ii .    in the case of the data set s - e5c , a fit in terms of two energy exchanges at the epochs assumed in the input model ( @xmath59 and @xmath94 ) shows that the values of @xmath95 can be accurately recovered : for example , in the considered test , we find @xmath96 and @xmath97 ( errors at 95 per cent cl ) with a @xmath49/d.o.f .  @xmath98 .",
    "this results are not significantly affected by allowing also for a free - free distortion .",
    "we find in this case : @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and the recovered @xmath101 is clearly in agreement with the null input value ( @xmath49/d.o.f .",
    "@xmath102 ) .",
    "we verified also that a ( wrong ) interpretation of these simulated data in terms of a single kind of spectral distortion is clearly ruled out ( and the recovery of the spectral distortions parameters is , of course , wrong ) . even in the most favourite case of a comptonization distortion",
    "we find a @xmath49/d.o.f .",
    "@xmath103 ( the @xmath49 goes from @xmath104 of previous fits to @xmath105 ) .",
    "analogously , an interpretation in terms of a single energy dissipation plus a free - free distortion is ruled out ( we find @xmath49/d.o.f .",
    "@xmath106 in the most favourite case of a comptonization distortion coupled to a free - free distortion ) .",
    "we then tried to estimate the epoch of the earlier energy injection . by assuming @xmath107 we find a @xmath108 but a degraded spectral distortion parameter recovery .",
    "in particular , the @xmath95 value of the later process is very weakly affected , while that of the earlier process is underestimated of @xmath109  % and a ( wrong ) small negative free - free detection , @xmath110 , appears , although clearly compatible with the input value @xmath84 at @xmath111 .",

    "we then conclude that reliable estimates of the epochs of the possible dissipation processes are achievable by combining _ dimes_-like and firas  ii - like experiments , even for very small energy exchanges .    by exploiting the data set s - e1.5c",
    ", we find that a fit in terms of two energy exchanges at the epochs assumed in the input model ( @xmath80 and @xmath94 ) allows to recover the values of @xmath95 with a sensitivity similar to that quoted above for the data set s - e5c . again , allowing for a free - free distortion does not represent a problem and models involving a single kind of spectral distortion or a single energy dissipation plus a free - free distortion can be easily ruled out by simple @xmath49 arguments . concerning the determination of the epoch of the earlier energy injection , in this case the comparison between the recovered signs of comptonization and free - free distortions does not play a relevant role and the direct analysis of the @xmath49 rules out values of @xmath48 smaller than @xmath123 .    finally , we analysed the data set s - e0.1c .",
    "we note that the differences between a spectrum resulting from a dissipation at @xmath124 and that produced by a late ( @xmath94 ) process are significantly less evident that those between a spectrum resulting from a dissipation at relevant @xmath48 ( @xmath125 ) and that produced by a late ( @xmath94 ) process .",
    "consequently , we may expect a degradation of the fit result quality .",
    "in fact , we find an appreciable underestimation of the earlier energy dissipation and an analogous overestimation of the later energy dissipation , and error bars significantly larger that in the previous cases : @xmath126 and @xmath127 ( errors at 95 per cent cl ) .",
    "note that , even in this unfavourite case , the recovered values of @xmath95 are in agreement with the input ones at @xmath128 level . also in this case , allowing for a free - free distortion does not degrade further the fit energy exchange recovery and models involving a single kind of spectral distortion or a single energy dissipation plus a free - free distortion can be directly ruled out by simple @xmath49 arguments .",
    "a firm estimate of the epoch of the earlier energy injection can not be achieved in this case : fits involving models with an earlier energy injection at @xmath125 do not show a significant increase of the @xmath49 . on the other hand , from the analysis of the previous cases",
    "we know that the epoch of a possible energy injection at relevant @xmath48 can be quite well estimated from such high quality data",
    ". therefore , in the situation in which a fit to the data in terms of two energy injections at different epochs ( plus , possibly a free - free distortion ) does not allow to estimate the epoch of the earlier process , it is quite reasonable to argue that the earlier process has been occurred at an epoch not particularly early ( by looking at the results found for the data set s - e1.5c , we argue in this case an upper limit @xmath129 ) .    we conclude that the combined information contained in future _ dimes _ and firas  ii experiments will allow to clearly identify the presence of spectral distortions also in the quite general case of a thermal histories involving early / intermediate and late processes , to measure the corresponding parameters with a good precision even for small amounts ( @xmath130 ) of dissipated energy , and to quite well constrain the epochs at which the processes have been possibly occurred .      in the previous subsection we have considered the information achievable by combining _",
    "dimes _ and firas  ii .",
    "burigana & salvaterra 2003 discussed the scientific capabilities of accurate long wavelength measures coupled to the available firas data .",
    "we then report here the results obtained by repeating the same analyses carried out above , but by considering the subsets of the data sets s - e5c , s - e1.5c , and s - e0.1c achievable by using firas  ii alone .    in the case of the data set s - e5c , we find that the two values of @xmath95 can be recovered with an accuracy only slightly degraded with respect to that of the previous section only by performing the fit in terms of two energy exchanges at the epochs assumed in the input model ( the resulting @xmath49/d.o.f .",
    "@xmath131 in this case ) while allowing for a free - free distortion implies a degradation of a factor @xmath8 in the @xmath95 recovery sensitivity .",
    "models with a single spectral distortions can be again ruled out ; the same holds for models involving a single energy dissipation plus a free - free distortion , although with a @xmath49 increase less significant than that found in the previous subsection ( for example , for a fit in terms of a comptonization distortion coupled to a free - free distortion we find @xmath49/d.o.f .",
    "@xmath132 , to be compared with the value of 1.774 found in the previous subsection ) .",
    "results similar to those described above are found by considering the data set s - e1.5c .",
    "the main difference concerns the impact of free - free distortion : by allowing for it in the fit we find in the test a significant underestimation ( @xmath133  % , no longer compatible at @xmath134 with the input one ) on the recovery of the earlier energy injection ( @xmath135 ) and a corresponding ( false ) detection of a negative ( at @xmath136 ) free - free distortion ( @xmath137 ) [ while the effect on comptonization distortions is small ; we find @xmath138 , errors at 95 per cent cl ] .",
    "clearly , by using only high frequency data , the two errors tends to compensate each other , because of their signatures in the final spectrum .    the exploitation of the data set s - e0.1c shows analogous results .",
    "the above problem related to the impact of free - free distortion is further enhanced and the parameter recovery sensitivity is significantly degrades : we find @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 ( errors at 95 per cent cl ) .",
    "in addition , while models with a single spectral distortions can be again directly ruled out , and the same holds for models without a late energy injection , models involving a single late ( @xmath94 ) energy dissipation plus a free - free distortion can not be longer ruled out on the basis on a direct @xmath49 analysis but on the requirement of having comptonization and free - free distortions with the same sign ( we recover in this case the values @xmath142 , i.e. about corresponding to the sum the energy dissipated by the two processes in order to fit the higher frequency tail of the spectrum , and a negative @xmath5 ( @xmath143 ) that tends to mimic the effect of an earlier energy dissipation ) .",
    "finally , we find that for all the three data sets only a poor information on the epoch of the earlier energy dissipation can be achieved .      from the comparison between the results reported in the two previous subsections",
    "we can draw the following conclusions .",
    "a firas  ii - like experiment shows a sensitivity to the values of the two energy exchanges at different cosmic times similar to that achieved by combining a firas  ii - like experiment and a _ dimes_-like experiment only in presence of a strong prior on the free - free distortion .    in the realistic case in which",
    "also @xmath5 should be recovered from the cmb spectrum data , the sensitivity of the spectral distortion parameter recovery will result significantly affected with respect to the case in which both firas  ii and a _ dimes _ data are available , with a sensitivity degradation factor of about @xmath144 , related to the epoch of the earlier dissipation process , and possible significant deviations of the recovered values from the input ones .",
    "in addition , the rejection of `` wrong '' ( i.e. different from those assumed in the input model ) models becomes less reliable in the case of earlier dissipations at @xmath145 , being based no longer on direct @xmath49 analyses but on physical requirements about the signs of the recovered free - free and comptonization distortions .",
    "finally , quite accurate estimates of the epochs of the earlier processes are no longer possible .    by combining these results with those reported in sect .  4.1 and with those presented in burigana & salvaterra 2003",
    ", we conclude that , although a significant progress of cmb spectrum measures only at @xmath6  cm or at @xmath7  cm certainly implies a great improvement of the current knowledge of thermal history of the universe , only the combination of very precise measures both at @xmath6  cm and at @xmath7  cm will allow to recover the spectral distortion parameters and to map the thermal history of the universe under quite general conditions .",
    "we extend here at @xmath146 ( i.e. @xmath147 ) the constraints on @xmath3 that would be possible to derive at @xmath148 ( @xmath59 ) with the combination of a _",
    "dimes_-like and a firas  ii - like experiment .",
    "we remember that at @xmath149 the compton scattering is able to restore , after an energy injection , the kinetic equilibrium between matter and radiation , yielding a be spectrum , and the combined effect of compton scattering and photon production processes tends to reduce the magnitude of spectral distortions , possibly leading to a blackbody spectrum .",
    "the contribution to the thermalization process by a possible cyclotron emission associated to cosmic magnetic fields by including also stimulated emission and absorption ( afshordi 2002 and references therein ) has been recently evaluated for realistic shapes of the distorted spectrum at early epochs ( zizzo 2003 , zizzo & burigana 2003 ) : the strong decreasing of the frequency dependent chemical potential , @xmath150 , of the be - like spectrum ( sunyaev & zeldovich 1970 ) at the very long wavelengths relevant for the cyclotron process implies a large suppression of the cyclotron efficiency .",
    "therefore , only for values of the cosmic magnetic field , @xmath151 , larger than @xmath152  g , well above current observational evidencies and theoretical predictions , this process is found to play a significant role , comparable to ( or larger than ) the combined effect of radiative compton and bremsstrahlung that drives the thermalization process for reasonable values of @xmath151 .",
    "we consider here for simplicity only the case of the simulated observation of a not distorted spectrum , that represents a good example of the possible improvements represented by such kinds of experiments , directly comparable to the results based on the current data .",
    "the comparison is shown in fig .  2 , where the results obtained by considering only simulated data from a _ dimes_-like experiment together with the real firas data ( burigana & salvaterra 2003 ) are also reported .",
    "note how the constraints on @xmath3 can be improved by a factor @xmath153 for processes possibly occurred in a wide range of cosmic epochs , corresponding to about a decade in redshift at @xmath154 about @xmath155 .",
    "it is also evident the improvement of the constraints on @xmath3 at @xmath156 , possible by adding firas  ii data to _ dimes _ data .    finally , note that the results based on simulated firas  ii and _ dimes _ data are obtained by relaxing any assumption on @xmath5 , assumed to be null in the other two cases",
    "( compare also the different cases reported in tables  1 and 2 ) .",
    "of course , large energy injections are still possible at very early epochs close to the thermalization redshift , when primordial nucleosynthesis set the ultimately constraints on energy injections in the cosmic radiation field .",
    "in the previous sections the constraints on free - free and comptonization distortions from the new generation of cmb spectrum experiments have been considered from a general point of view , without assuming detailed physical models for their genesis .",
    "such kinds of late distortions are expected in many astrophysical scenarios involving some energy dissipation mechanisms during various stages of the star and galaxy evolution or some particle or scalar field decay model ( see e.g. de  zotti & burigana 1992 , tegmark & silk 1995 ) .",
    "the relevance of their detection ( kogut 2003 ) has been partially renewed by the _ wmap _ satellite discovery of a reionization phase at relevant redshifts , mainly supported by _",
    "wmap _ detection of an excess in the cmb te cross - power spectrum on large angular scale ( multipoles @xmath157 ) , indicating an optical depth to the cmb last scattering surface of @xmath158 ( kogut et al .",
    "2003 ) .    without the ambition",
    "to exhaustively cover a so wide topic , we compare here the coupled free - free and comptonization distortions for some of the models recently discussed in the literature and discuss the possibility to reveal them with the new generation of cmb spectrum experiments .",
    "table  3 summarizes the chances of observing the comptonization and free - free distortions for the four classes of processes discussed in the following subsections on the basis of the sensitivities reported in table  2 ( of course , a more optimistic conclusion for the possibility to measure the comptonization distortion , i.e. a sensitivity improvement by a factor @xmath159 , could be derived by assuming a quite strong prior on the earlier energy exchange ; compare the last row of table a1 with the last three rows of table  2 ) .",
    "oh ( 1999 ) predicted the level of free - free distortion can be produced by ionized halos in the early stage of galaxy formation by computing the moments of the intensity distribution from a press - schechter based model .",
    "the predicted free - free distortion results to be @xmath160  k at @xmath103  ghz corresponding to a free - free distortion parameter @xmath161 , well within the sensitivity of _ dimes_. the associated comptonization distortion predicted in this work is below the current firas upper limit by about one order of magnitude , and is then likely measurable by a firas  ii - like experiment .",
    "moreover , this work assumed that free - free emitters are the only radio - bright sources in the sky .",
    "the existence of radio - loud galaxies and agns is likely to increase the spectral distortion due to radio sources .      the integrated comptonization distortion from quasar driven blastwaves has been recently computed by platania et al .",
    "2002 through a quite general `` energetic '' approach , not particularly related to a detailed physical assumption .",
    "they found @xmath162 , clearly measurable with a firas  ii - like experiment , with approximately the same fractional contribution from low-@xmath154 ( 02 ) and high - z ( 24 ) objects .",
    "the evaluation of the corresponding integrated free - free distortion is less model independent , being significantly sensitive to the density profile inside the blastwave because of the @xmath163 dependence of the free - free emission . by assuming the model described in sect .  2 of platania et al .",
    "2002 , we have computed the ratio between the comptonization parameter @xmath83 and the free - free parameter @xmath5 integrated over the line - of - sight of the blastwave centre between the galaxy outer cut - off radius , @xmath164 , approximately separating the virialized and infall regions , and an inner radius , @xmath165 ( @xmath166 , where the time required for the shock front to reach the outer radius of the galaxy equals the free - free cooling timescale ( it is in fact reasonable to assume that the physical conditions at @xmath167 are more related to the central engine than to the blastwave evolution ) . by assuming an electron temperature @xmath168  k ( @xmath169  k ) and a wide range of line - of - sight velocity dispersions , @xmath170  km / s , we find @xmath171 ( @xmath172 ) for objects both at @xmath173 and at @xmath174 , while only for low values of @xmath22 ( @xmath175  k ) and high values of @xmath73 ( @xmath176 ) @xmath177 approaches the unity .",

    "<S> these results are possible because such levels of accuracy on a so wide frequency range allow to remove the approximate degeneracy both between free - free and bose - einstein ( be ) like distortions and between comptonization and be - like distortions that remain in presence of future significant improvements only at @xmath6  cm or at @xmath7  cm , respectively . </S>",
