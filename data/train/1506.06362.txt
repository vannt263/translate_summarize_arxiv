    "the finite volume element ( fve ) method has been widely used in numerically solving partial deferential equations .",
    "the main feature of fve method is that it inherits some physical conservation laws of original problems locally , which are very desirable in practical applications . during the last decades",
    ", many research works have been presented for fve methods solving various partial differential equations , see @xcite and the references cited therein .",
    "superconvergence of numerical solutions has been an active research area for finite element method ( fem ) since its practical importance in enhancing the accuracy of finite element approximation .",
    "but the study of superconvergence properties of fve methods is far behind that of fems . for elliptic problems in two - dimensional domain , the early superconvergence results of linear and bilinear fve solutions are of this form @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath3 is the set of optimal stress points of interpolation function on partition @xmath5",
    ", @xmath6 is the total number of points in @xmath3 , and @xmath7 denotes the average gradient on elements containing point @xmath8 .",
    "later , lv and li in @xcite extended result ( [ 1.1 ] ) to the isoparametric bilinear fve on quadrilateral meshes under the @xmath9-uniform mesh condition .",
    "recently , zhang and zou in @xcite also derived some superconvergence results for the bi - complete @xmath10-order fve on rectangular meshes , and in the case of bilinear fve ( @xmath11 ) , their result is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the gauss point of element ( the midpoint of element ) .",
    "moreover , by using the postprocessing technique , chou and ye @xcite obtain the superconvergence estimate : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the postprocessed linear fve solution obtained by the @xmath16-projection method ; zhang and sheng @xcite further derive the superconvergence estimate : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the reconstructed gradient of bilinear fve solution obtained by using the patch interpolation recovery method .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the bilinear fve method to solve the following problem @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a rectangular domain with boundary @xmath21 , coefficient matrix @xmath22 .",
    "our main goal is to give some piecewise - point gradient superconvergence for the bilinear fve approximation to problem ( [ 1.5 ] ) . to the authors best knowledge , in existing literatures ,",
    "only the midpoints of elements are proved to be the superconvergence point of gradient approximation @xcite ( also see ( [ 1.2 ] ) ) , we here will prove that except the midpoints of elements , all interior mesh points and midpoints of interior edges are also the superconvergence points .",
    "generally speaking , the analysis of bilinear fve on rectangular meshes is more difficult then that of linear fve on triangle meshes , the reason is that @xmath23 is not constant in the former case . by calculating exactly some integrals on element and its boundary ,",
    "we first establish the superclose weak estimate for the bilinear form of the fve method , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the bilinear interpolation operator , @xmath26 is the projection operator from the trial function space @xmath27 to the test function space",

    "we further derive the following superconvergence result for the gradient approximation @xmath28 where @xmath3 is the optimal stress point set of bilinear interpolation function which is composed of the interior mesh points , the midpoints of interior edges and the midpoints of elements .    this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we introduce the fve method and give some lemmas . in section 3 ,",
    "we establish the superconvergence weak estimate .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the piecewise - point gradient supconvergence estimate on the set @xmath3 .",
    "finally , in section 5 , numerical experiments are provided to illustrate our theoretical analysis .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt the notations @xmath29 to indicate the usual sobolev spaces on domain @xmath30 equipped with the norm @xmath31 and semi - norm @xmath32 , and if @xmath33 , we set @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "when @xmath36 , we omit the index @xmath37 . we will use letter @xmath38 to represent a generic positive constant , independent of the mesh size @xmath39 .",

    "associated with partition @xmath5 , we construct the central dual partition @xmath55 by connecting the center of each element to the midpoints of edges by straight lines .",
    "thus , for each nodal point @xmath2 in @xmath5 , there exists a rectangle @xmath56 surrounding @xmath2 , @xmath57 is called the dual element or the control volume at point @xmath2 , see fig.1 .",

    "but for the fve method , we need a new weak form .",
    "let @xmath66 be the solution of problem ( [ 1.5 ] ) , then by using green s formula , we have @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the outward unit normal vector on the boundary concerned .",
    "motivated by this weak formula , we introduce the following bilinear form @xmath69 and define the fve approximation of problem ( [ 1.5 ] ) by finding @xmath70 such that @xmath71    let @xmath72 be the interpolation operator defined by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the characteristic function of the dual element @xmath56 . since @xmath26 is a one to one mapping from @xmath27 onto @xmath59 , then the equivalent form of problem ( [ 2.7 ] ) is that find @xmath70 such that @xmath75 this is the fve scheme to be used in our analysis . from ( [ 2.5 ] ) we know that scheme ( [ 2.8 ] ) is consistent and the following error equation holds .",
