    "optical color - magnitude diagrams reveal that @xmath0 of the evolved stars in older open clusters do not fall along standard single - star evolutionary tracks .",

    "sub - subgiant stars ( ssgs ) were first identified in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of the open cluster m67 @xcite .",
    "these two ssgs fall to the red of both the main - sequence and main - sequence binary track and well below the subgiant branch .",
    "both ssgs have high membership probabilities based on both proper - motion and radial - velocity ( rv ) data , leaving a negligible probability that both are field interlopers .",
    "broadly speaking , the populations of ssgs in globular and open clusters share similar characteristics .",
    "they fall to the red of the main sequence and below the subgiant and giant branch on optical cmds , a region that can not be easily populated by either single - star evolutionary theory or by any combination of two normal cluster stars .",
    "they are also typically x - ray sources with @xmath1 erg s@xmath2 and photometric variables with periods between 1 and 20 days .",

    "the sample of ssgs with both high quality 3d kinematic memberships and known orbital solutions for the binaries is small , consisting of 6 stars in two open clusters in the wiyn open cluster study ( wocs ; @xcite ) : 4 ssgs ( 3 binaries and one single star ) in ngc 6791 @xcite and 2 binaries in m67 @xcite .",
    "we use this sample to guide the formation of an origin theory that matches the observed properties of this sample .",

    "all but one of these binaries are circular , and they all have short periods ranging from 2.8 to 18.4 days .    while it is possible that any one ssg could be a field contaminant , given the kinematic memberships the probability that all of these systems are field stars is quite low . @xcite",

    "we use bse as an efficient tool to search the large progenitor - binary parameter space .",
    "we use mesa to produce more detailed models of the evolution of systems bse indicates may produce ssgs .",

    ". to begin , we define a sample of 5000 binaries for the first generation with :    * primary masses chosen randomly from a uniform distribution between 0.7 m@xmath9   ( well below the msto in both clusters ) and twice the turnoff mass of the cluster , * secondary masses chosen randomly from a uniform distribution between 0.1 m@xmath9   and twice the turnoff mass , * periods chosen randomly from a uniform distribution between 3 days and 5000 days , * and eccentricities chosen randomly from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 .",
    "these distributions cover the relevant initial parameter space , but are not meant to reproduce the true shapes of these binary distributions , for example as observed in open clusters .",
    "bse then evolves these 5000 systems up to the age of the cluster ( 4 gyr for m67 , 8 gyr for ngc 6791 ) .",

    "we evaluate fitness based on two criteria : the observed location of a system in a bv cmd , and the period of the final binary system .",
    "specifically , we define the fitness ( f ) as : @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35where i = b - v , v , or p , respectively , o refers to the observed color , magnitude or period of the ssgs , and s the color , magnitude , or period of the bse model .    for m67",
    ", we took @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "for ngc 6791 we took @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "for both clusters , we select for short period systems by taking @xmath40 days , and we adopt @xmath41 days , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .    for a second round of models , we sought to produce systems matching the orbital periods of the ssgs in ngc 6791 and m67 .",
    "for this we re - ran the genetic algorithm for each cluster , this time taking @xmath44 to be the specific orbital period of each ssg . for 15028 , the sb2 ssg , we also included a fitness term for the mass ratio of the system ( @xmath45 ) with @xmath46=0.7 .",
    "after evaluating the fitness of each of the 5000 first - generation models , we take any models with non - zero fitness and these models become  parents \" for the next generation of models .",
    "technically we limit the number of parents per generation to 1000 , but we rarely find more than a few hundred .",
    "parents are then allowed to  mate \" with each other to produce two `` children '' per parent - parent pair in the next generation . to define the children",
    ", we begin with the parent that has the highest fitness value , allow it to mate with all other parents , repeat this process for the parent with the second highest fitness value , and so on until we obtain all parent - parent combinations or we produce 3000 children .",
    "to produce a child we take a random combination of the initial parameters from each parent . specifically , to determine each initial binary parameter for a child",
    ", we draw a random number from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 ; if the number is @xmath47 , we choose the initial parameter of the first parent , and otherwise we choose the initial parameter from the second parent for the child .",
    "if a child duplicates a binary already in the subsequent generation , we impose a mutation where at least one of the binary initial parameters is chosen randomly from the same respective distribution defining the initial parameters if the first generation , and the number of mutated parameters is chosen randomly .",
    "we take the @xmath48 children produced in this manner , and fill the remaining @xmath49 spots with binaries whose parameters are chosen from the same distributions as the initial generation .",
    "we then evolve this new generation of 5000 binaries with bse up to the cluster age , and the process is repeated for 100 generations . through this procedure ,",
    "we ensure that subsequent generations climb to higher and higher fitness values , retain the best fitting binaries throughout the generations , and introduce a fresh sample of random binaries in each generation to fill out the parameter space .",
    "note that the genetic algorithm does not uniformly sample parameter space , and therefore can potentially miss a peak in the fitness surface .",
    "this is alleviated somewhat by the introduction of binaries with randomly chosen initial parameters into each generation .",
    "we ran 20 simulations of the genetic algorithm ( with different initial random seeds ) and combine the results to further alleviate this issue .      in both sets of runs ,",
    "those selecting for an orbital period of 10 days and those selecting for specific ssg orbital periods , bse was able to produce systems in the ssg region of a cmd .",
    "inspection of these results show that there is a family of solutions that create these ssg systems . in m67 ,",
    "the progenitor binaries are generally high - eccentricity systems with periods between 3 and 1000 days , with the longest period binaries requiring eccentricities approaching 1 .",
    "the secondary star can possess a range of masses between 0.3 and 0.8 m@xmath9 , with the majority being drawn from the lower end of this range .",
    "the primary star is a @xmath8 m@xmath9   star that begins roche lobe overflow somewhere on the subgiant branch .",
    "this requires that tidal forces circularize and shrink the initial orbit of these systems so that when they evolve through the subgiant branch they have periods of @xmath50 day .",
    "we note that our choice of a large tidal strength factor may artificially allow the wide , high eccentricity systems to circularize , but this does not change the conclusion that we require @xmath51 day binaries on the subgiant branch to create ssgs via mass transfer .",
    "the final ssg systems are short period ( p @xmath52 days ) circular binaries .",
    "the highest fitness solutions have reduced the primary mass to @xmath530.2 m@xmath9 , and increased the secondary mass to @xmath531.0 m@xmath9 , though a wide range of final primary and secondary masses are produced by the algorithm .    in ngc 6791 ,",
    "results are similar .",
    "the progenitor binaries are again high - eccentricity systems with periods from 3 days up to 1000 days , with longer period systems requiring higher eccentricities .",
    "initial primary masses are @xmath54 m@xmath9 , with secondaries ranging from 0.3 - 0.5 m@xmath9 , with the majority drawn from the lower mass end .",
    "the final systems are circular binaries periods of just a few days .",
    "the longest period system created was a 3.26 day binary .",
    "bse was unable to produce ssgs with periods above 3.5 days in ngc 6791 , or 7 days in m67 .",
    "these periods are shorter than 5 out of the 6 ssgs in our sample.the only individual ssg that we had some success at reproducing using the genetic algorithm was 15028 .",
    "this 2.8 day binary falls solidly in the period domain that can be created by mass transfer .",
    "however , creating an ssg with the observed mass ratio of this system ( @xmath55 ) proved problematic .",
    "the genetic algorithm strongly favored smaller @xmath56 values for longer period ssgs , with a @xmath55 possible only for shorter period binaries with @xmath57 day .",
    "we note that the algorithm produces longer period ssgs in m67 than in ngc 6791 , which is as expected .",
    "the roche lobe radius is given by @xcite as : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the roche lobe radius , a is the orbital separation , and @xmath56 is the mass ratio of the binary system .",
    "the roche lobe radius depends only on the mass ratio and the orbital separation of a binary .",
    "the stellar radius depends on a star s mass and evolutionary state . since subgiants in ngc 6791 are lower mass than in m67 , they begin with smaller radii . therefore , for a given mass ratio and orbital separation , ngc 6791 subgiants must reach a more evolved state to exceed their roche lobes .",
    "this means they will have evolved further up the giant branch than their m67 counterparts , and thus not evolve through the ssg domain as they lose mass .",
    "in order for an ngc 6791 subgiants to evolve through the ssg region as they lose mass , they must then have smaller orbital separations than are required for m67 subgiants .",
    "the results indicate that , while we do expect mass transfer to create ssg systems , we would expect the observed periods to be in the range of just a few days in both clusters , shorter than most of the observed ssgs .",
    "bse therefore suggests that none of the ngc 6791 ssgs have short enough periods to be mass transfer systems .",
    "similarly , while mass transfer may create a 2.8 day binary like the one observed in m67 , the expected mass ratio would be much smaller than the observed @xmath55 , and bse is unable to create the other 18.4 day binary .",
    "the bse - based genetic algorithm is an excellent tool for exploring a wide range of parameter space , but the stellar evolution and mass transfer calculations are highly parameterized .",
    "we therefore also use the more detailed evolution code modules for experiments in stellar astrophysics ( mesa ; @xcite ) to create ssgs via stable mass transfer , and compare the results of these mesa models to our observations .",
    "for m67 we initially ran a coarse grid of models with input based on the bse results .",
    "these models all had a primary mass of @xmath60 m@xmath9  and companion masses in the range @xmath61 m@xmath9@xmath62 m@xmath9 .",
    "we evolved each component of the binary up to core hydrogen exhaustion before placing it in a binary with a period between 1 and 10 days and allowing the evolution to proceed .",
    "we start from the test suite case ` binary_both_stars ` , use non - rotating models , and do not include magnetic braking .",
    "we used three different mass transfer efficiencies : @xmath63 , and @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath65 is defined such that fully conservative mass transfer has @xmath66 , and if no mass is transfered @xmath67 .",
    "mass and angular momentum are presumed to be lost from the vicinity of the primary in these models .",
    "models with periods above @xmath68 days began roche lobe overflow after beginning their ascent up the red giant branch , and mass transfer products did not evolve through the ssg region . in many cases mass",
    "transfer was dynamically unstable and we terminated their evolution , as mesa can not handle these cases .",
    "it is generally assumed that binaries undergoing unstable case b mass transfer enter a common envelope phase that ends with the spiraling in of the binary and an ejection of the common envelope material @xcite .",
    "the end product of this phase is either a shorter period white dwarf - main sequence binary or a merger to create a single star .",
    "if this is correct , we conclude these longer period systems do not create ssgs .    models with periods less than @xmath68 days began roche lobe overflow while still on the subgiant branch and did proceed through the ssg region as mass transfer proceeded . for these shorter period models we ran a more detailed grid of models with periods between 0.6 and 2.0 days , @xmath60 m@xmath9 , varying @xmath69 from @xmath61 m@xmath9@xmath62 m@xmath9 , and using three mass transfer efficiencies @xmath66 , @xmath70 , and @xmath64 .",
    "our models indicate that systems with initial periods @xmath71 days begin rlo prior to evolution onto the subgiant branch and do not pass through the ssg region .",
    "models with @xmath72 days@xmath73 days will often evolve through the ssg region depending on @xmath69 and mass transfer efficiency .",
    "models with @xmath74 days may have primaries that evolve through the ssg region , but mass transfer is only stable in these systems if they have a near equal - mass secondary .",
    "due to the required mass of the secondary , the combined light of the binary does not pass into the ssg domain .",
    "therefore , it appears that only a very narrow range of systems with periods right around @xmath75 day begin mass transfer at the right time in their evolution , with faint enough companions to move through the ssg domain .    as an example",
    ", we show a grid of mesa models with a 1.0 day period , 1.3 m@xmath9  primary and a range of secondary masses from 0.3 m@xmath9  to 1.25 m@xmath9  in figure  [ fig : mesagrid ] with the secondary mass indicated by the color of the track . in this grid , for a large range of secondary masses and mass transfer efficiencies",
    ", the primary will evolve near the domain of the m67 ssgs ( see figure 3 , middle row .",
    "however , only for models beginning with a fairly low - mass secondary and a moderate degree of non - conservativeness will the combined light of the binary evolve through this region ( figure 3 , top row ) .",
    "for example , see the top middle plot . only the model binaries with progenitor secondaries of 0.5 and 0.7 m@xmath9",
    "are observed in the ssg region during their evolution .",
    "the evolution of the accreting stars in these models is also interesting .",
    "we assume the accreting star in these binaries is a main sequence star with initial mass ranging from 0.3 to 1.25 m@xmath9 . for models where mass transfer can proceed stably and we assume a significant fraction of the mass lost from the primary is accreted by the secondary",
    ", the secondaries may gain several tenths of a solar mass of material .",
    "this accretion causes them to move up the main sequence to a position corresponding to their new larger mass .",
    "if the accreting star starts close enough to the main sequence turn off , or we assume a large mass - transfer efficiency , the accreting star may move above the main - sequence turn - off and in to the blue straggler region ( for example , see figure 3 , lower left plot ) . as these accretors begin to evolve off the main sequence , their higher mass causes them to follow an evolutionary track brighter and bluer than the cluster isochrone .",
    "such ` yellow stragglers ' have been observed in m67 and other clusters , and are believed to be evolved blue stragglers @xcite . in this mass transfer scenario , then , ssgs could be part of the same evolutionary pathway that leads to the formation of other non - standard stars like the blue and yellow stragglers .",
    "we ran another grid for ngc 6791 , using a primary of @xmath76 m@xmath9 , varying @xmath69 from @xmath61 m@xmath9  @xmath77 m@xmath9 , using three mass transfer efficiencies @xmath66 , @xmath70 , and @xmath64 , and periods between 0.6 and 10.0 days .",
    "results were similar to those of m67 .",
    "the models indicate that systems with initial periods @xmath78 days moved through the ssg region during rlo . as in m67 , longer period systems began mass transfer on the lower giant branch , and if mass loss proceeded stably the model evolved to the red of the rgb , not down into the ssg region .",
    "we compare this finding to the results of the bse models . shown in figure  [ period_histograms ]",
    "is a histogram of orbital periods of the ssg binaries produced in bse models of m67 and ngc 6791 ( section [ section : bse ] ) .",
    "we show both the orbital period of the system at onset of rlo , and the final period of the binary at 4 gyr when it is observed as an ssg .",
    "we also show the shortest and longest period ssg created with mesa with vertical dashed blue lines .",
    "note that our grid of mesa models has a resolution of 0.1 days in period .",
    "we conclude that the mesa results are consistent with our findings from bse that only binaries in @xmath51 day orbits at onset of rlo will move through the ssg region .      given this period range for ssg formation",
    ", we can use the period distribution found by @xcite to estimate the number of predicted ssg systems in a cluster . specifically , @xcite fit a gaussian function to the distribution of orbital periods found in a large sample of binary systems .",
    "they find @xmath79=5.03 and @xmath80 .",
    "integrating this function using the upper and lower period bounds found for m67 ( @xmath81 ) and ngc 6791 ( @xmath78 ) we would expect only @xmath82 of binaries to go through this evolution . assuming a @xmath83 binary fraction and given a population of @xmath84 subgiant stars in m67 , and @xmath85 subgiant stars in ngc 6791 ( see section 6.4 ) , this results in a poisson probability of observing one or more mass transfer ssgs in m67 of 4@xmath19 and in ngc 6791 of @xmath86 .",
    "this estimate should be regarded as an upper limit , as period is not the only factor which determines whether a star moves through the ssg region .",
    "for example , if the companion mass is very small , mass transfer may be unstable and the system would not evolve as an ssg .",
    "conversely , if the companion is too close to the main sequence turn off , the secondary may overwhelm the lower - luminosity primary and move the system into a more standard region of the cmd or into the blue straggler domain .",
    "given this small number , it is unlikely , though not impossible that we would observe a mass - transfer ssg in ngc 6791 or m67 .",
    "however , this mechanism is unlikely to explain all the ssgs observed in m67 or ngc 6791 .",
    "the poisson probability of producing 2 ssgs in m67 or 4 in ngc 6791 from mass transfer is negligible .",
    "however , in a larger cluster it may be quite likely to observe at least one mass transfer ssg . in a companion paper , geller et al .",
    "2017b ( in preparation ) , we investigate in more detail the expected formation frequency of this and other formation mechanisms across a wide range of cluster properties .",
    "a serious mismatch between mass transfer models and observations is that model mass transfer ssgs have shorter periods than most ssgs observed in m67 and ngc 6791 .",
    "one method to produce longer period binaries undergoing mass loss is to adopt a model in which the primary can lose substantial mass via a wind while still well within its roche lobe .",
    "the tidally enhanced wind model proposed by @xcite proposes that tidal interactions and magnetic activity drive a stronger stellar wind in close binary systems than in a typical single star .",
    "they assume that the wind can be described by the standard reimer s wind for rgb stars , multiplied by a factor that has the same dependence on stellar radius ( @xmath87 ) and roche lobe radius ( @xmath88 ) as a tidal torque .",
    "specifically , their expression is :    @xmath89)\\\\ \\mbox{where } \\dot{m}_{reimers}=-4 \\times 10^{-13 } \\bigg ( \\frac{rl}{m}\\bigg ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where r , l , and m are in solar units and time is in years . here",
    "they assume that wind mass loss saturates when @xmath90 .",
    "this wind prescription includes a constant multiplicative factor ( @xmath91 ) that may be varied to achieve greater or lesser mass loss rates .",
    "@xcite calibrate this constant to match the properties of the system z her , a detached rs cvn binary with a mass ratio inversion in which the more evolved star is near the end of the subgiant branch and is less massive than its near - turnoff companion .",
    "its orbital period is @xmath92 days .",
    "they find @xmath93 well matches the observed mass loss from the primary .",
    "using a tidally enhanced wind model can reproduce an ssg similar to 15028 ( figure 5 ) .",
    "this model has an initial primary mass of 1.3 m@xmath9 , a period of 2.8 days , and a coefficient of @xmath94 , twice as large as that proposed in @xcite .",
    "the mass loss rates on the subgiant branch required are on the order of @xmath95 m@xmath9  yr@xmath2 .",
    "the star has a mass of just 0.95 m@xmath9  when it reaches the cmd location of 15028 .",
    "while we have no direct mass measurement of 15028 , we do have a mass ratio of @xmath55 from the orbital solution .",
    "given this mass ratio , the 0.95 m@xmath9  mass from the tidally - enhanced wind model would imply a secondary of @xmath96 m@xmath9 , in which case the observed secondary is substantially hotter and more luminous than expected for a @xmath96 m@xmath9  star @xcite .",
    "alternatively , assuming the rotational and orbital axes are aligned , a secondary mass of @xmath97 m@xmath9  well matches the photometry , spectroscopic temperature , and mean density of the secondary star @xcite .",
    "this would imply a mass of 1.3 m@xmath9  for the primary , indicating a subgiant that has not lost substantial mass .",
    "however , the luminosity ratio of the system is not consistent with the alignment of the axes , and @xcite were not able to find a fully self - consistent model for the system .",
    "the ssgs in ngc 6791 are in longer - period orbits than 15028 .",
    "they also presumably start with smaller radii if they are normal cluster subgiants undergoing mass loss .",
    "therefore , the tidal wind enhancement does not produce a noticeable effect in the models until the stars have evolved substantially up the giant branch .",
    "even increasing the b parameter by a factor of 10 is unable to create observed systems near the location of the ngc 6791 ssgs .",
    "similarly , a tidally enhanced wind model for the 18.4 day binary in m67 also does not produce significant mass loss until the primary is substantially more evolved .",
    "these stellar models never move through the ssg region .",
    "overall the wind prescription of @xcite is unable to reproduce the cmd location of any of the ngc 6791 ssgs or the 18.4 day ssg in m67 using a value of b close to what is typically assumed .",
    "these stars are just not close enough to their roche radii to have large mass loss rates using this model .",
    "this wind prescription can create the 2.8 day ssg in m67 by losing @xmath98 m@xmath9  from a subgiant primary , but it is not clear from the observational evidence that this star has lost substantial mass . we conclude that wind mass loss rates are likely not large enough to be the sole reason for the ssgs under - luminosity .",
    "another possibility is that ssgs could be created as a result of removing the envelope of a subgiant star .",
    "rapid envelope mass loss yields a rapid decrease in luminosity , and subsequent evolution below the current subgiant branch to a lower - mass red giant branch .",
    "such stripping could occur in a number of ways .",
    "one suggestion is that such mass loss may occur if a subgiant star has a close encounter with a passing star .",
    "this may occur , for example , during a resonant binary encounter ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if the impact parameter of the passage is sufficient to disrupt and remove a large fraction of the stellar envelope , but not close enough to lead to a merger , an ssg - like star might result .      in order to explore the effect of envelope mass loss on a subgiant , we remove mass from a subgiant star at a high , constant rate using mesa , stopping the mass loss after the star has lost a few tenths of a solar mass of material from its envelope and allowing the star to continue to evolve without further mass loss . in principle ,",
    "any mass loss rate in which the subgiant can lose a few tenths of a solar mass of material within its subgiant lifetime can move the subgiant into the ssg domain .",
    "this requires mass loss rates @xmath99 m@xmath9  @xmath100 .",
    "in practice , mesa does not handle dynamical mass loss , and thus the highest mass loss rate for which we achieve numerical stability is @xmath101 m@xmath9  @xmath2 .    as an example",
    ", we show an m67 model in which we strip mass from a 1.3 m@xmath9  subgiant star at a rate of @xmath101 m@xmath9  yr@xmath2 , stopping the mass loss when the subgiant reaches 0.8 , 0.9 , 1.0 , or 1.1 m@xmath9 . for an ngc 6791 model ,",
    "we strip mass from a 1.1 m@xmath9  star , stopping mass loss when the subgiant reaches 0.7 , 0.8 , or 0.9 m@xmath9 . plots of the resulting mesa evolutionary tracks are shown in figure [ ngc6791_dynamical ] .",
    "the high mass loss rates produce models that are out of thermal equilibrium , causing a rapid drop in luminosity .",
    "when mass loss is terminated , the models quickly return to equilibrium and resume evolution along a subgiant / giant track .",
    "due to their newly reduced masses , these tracks are at lower temperature and luminosity than a normal cluster giant . a mass loss rate this large or larger would be required to strip enough envelope material to produce an ssg during a short - duration event like a dynamical encounter",
    "however , lower mass loss rates between @xmath102 and @xmath103 m@xmath9  yr@xmath2 could also produce stars in the ssg region if the duration of the stripping event is longer .",
    "lower rates produce a more gradual decline in luminosity and do not drive the star out of thermal equilibrium ( similar to the mass transfer models in fig .",
    "3 ) , but the models still move through the ssg region if they begin mass loss early enough on the subgiant branch to lose several tenths of a solar mass before beginning their ascent up the giant branch .",
    "these models indicate that mass loss of 0.3 - 0.4 m@xmath9  on the subgiant branch can produce stars in the ssg domain for a wide range of mass loss rates .",
    "these mesa models indicate that if a subgiant loses significant envelope mass it will move in to the ssg cmd region .",
    "we conjecture that one possible mechanism to remove this envelope mass would be a grazing dynamical encounter . in this encounter scenario ,",
    "another star would have to pass close enough to a subgiant to tidally strip envelope material , but not close enough to lead to a merger .",
    "a similar mechanism has been proposed to explain the depletion of red giants near the milky way galactic center @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "encounters between rgb stars and black holes can eject the red giant core from the envelope .",
    "the core retains only a fraction of the envelope material , creating a giant with a significantly reduced envelope mass .",
    "they also find rgb - ms encounters capable of ejecting envelope material if the impact parameter is small enough .",
    "similar models of encounters at the galactic center have found that encounters between rgb stars and ms stars , white dwarfs , or neutron stars can cause significant stripping of a giant envelope , though the amount of mass loss varies substantially between these studies .",
    "depending on the specifics of the encounter and assumptions of the models , some conclude less than 10 % of the envelope mass will be ejected @xcite , and others find nearly the entire envelope may be lost @xcitef . at this stage of evolution , losing even a large fraction of the envelope does not prevent the giant from continuing its evolution up the giant branch , and it does not move into the ssg cmd region @xcite    here we suggest similar encounters with subgiants or early giants may create ssgs . however , no existing studies focus specifically on subgiant encounters",
    ". new hydrodynamic simulations for subgiants would be necessary to advance this hypothesis , specifically determining the range of impact parameters that yield substantial mass loss while avoiding common envelope mergers as well as determining the possible orbital parameters for a post - encounter binary .      to explore the frequency of such dynamical encounters",
    ", we consider the case of the m67 ssgs .",
    "using the encounter rates presented in @xcite , we find the time between single - binary encounters to be @xmath104 yrs . to get the encounter rate for subgiants",
    ", we can scale this rate by the fraction of stars in the cluster that are subgiants or early giants .",
    "in m67 , we observe @xmath105 subgiants or early giants .",
    "adopting the total number of stars in m67 to be @xmath106 @xcite results in a subgiant fraction of @xmath107 . scaling our single - binary encounter rate by @xmath107",
    ", we find a time between single - binary encounters involving a subgiant to be @xmath108 years .",
    "if we assume that all of these encounters lead to an ssg , and that the ssg is observable for its entire subgiant lifetime of @xmath109 myr in m67 , we find the poisson probability of observing an ssg formed via a single - binary encounter in m67 to be @xmath110 .",
    "using the same assumptions , binary - binary encounters also result in a @xmath111 chance of observing an ssg .",
    "while encounters with triples may also play a role , the smaller number of triples makes binary - binary or single - binary encounters the dominant encounter types .",
    "more likely only a small fraction of encounters involving subgiants would strip the subgiant s envelope rather than leading to a merger , resulting in a very low probability of observing a dynamically formed ssg in m67 .",
    "dynamically formed ssgs may be more likely to be observed in larger clusters .",
    "we investigate this channel in more detail in the companion paper geller et al .",
    "2017b , including in globular cluster environments where the larger core densities and higher encounter rates may make this a more likely mechanism .",
    "we have proposed two mechanisms that create ssgs via mass loss from a subgiant : 1 ) mass transfer in a binary system and 2 ) tidal stripping of a subgiant s envelope during a dynamical encounter .",
    "whether from mass transfer or envelope stripping , the essential finding in sections 3 and 4 is that mass loss from a subgiant of several tenths of a solar mass successfully creates stars in the ssg cmd region .",
    "our explorations suggest that neither roche lobe overflow nor tidal stripping via dynamical encounters produce ssgs with high enough frequency to explain the observations .",
    "however , we have not fully explored all mechanisms of stellar mass loss , and there may be other ways for a subgiant to lose substantial envelope mass .",
    "for example , if a binary system with a subgiant primary went through a period of common envelope evolution , ejecting some but not all of a giant s envelope material before the mass loss stabilized , the remaining system might resemble an ssg .",
    "@xcite create an ssg in an n - body simulation of m67 using a similar mechanism .",
    "in their model , two stars merge in a common envelope event , ejecting 0.29 m@xmath9   masses of material in the process .",
    "the resulting star lies below the subgiant branch . as a second example",
    ", an ssg with a millisecond pulsar companion has been found in the globular cluster ngc 6397 @xcite .",
    "the ssg is a giant that is extremely under - massive ( 0.22 m@xmath9- 0.32 m@xmath9 ) because it is being evaporated by the wind from its pulsar companion @xcite .",
    "while the n - body ssg is not in a binary and open clusters are unlikely to have millisecond pulsars , we encourage further exploration of more mass - loss hypotheses both in open cluster and other environments .",
    "it is also worth noting that dynamical encounters between main sequence stars are common , and can lead to the collision of two main sequence stars to form a single object .",
    "such collision products are out of thermal equilibrium immediately after collision , and become much brighter than the main sequence due to the energy deposition in their envelopes during the encounter @xcite .",
    "as these products settle back into equilibrium , they contract and move back towards the main sequence .",
    "this occurs over a thermal timescale of a few myr , but during this time such a collision product may be found in the ssg cmd domain @xcite . due to the short duration of this phase compared to the single - binary and binary - binary encounter rate for m67 derived in section  [ sec : encounterrate ] , the poisson probability of observing such a collision product is just a few percent .",
    "these encounter products are expected to be rapidly rotating single stars , not close binaries .",
    "scattering experiments find that it is difficult for collision products to retain close binary companions ( e.g. @xcite ) , and thus we do not consider this a likely explanation for the systems in our sample . while we do determine one of the ssgs to be a single star , it is not observed to be rotating rapidly , and thus is unlikely to be a recent collision product .",
    "again , collisions are more common in denser globular clusters , and we explore the frequency of this formation mechanism in geller et al . 2017b .",

    "@xcite determine spectroscopic temperatures a few hundred k warmer than our best - fit sed temperatures in the m67 ssgs .",

    "we revisit our analysis of the ssg seds from section 2 to analyze the impact of spots on the determination of radius , temperature , and luminosity .",
    "for example , we refit the 15028 sed to include a 3500 k spot while varying the spot covering fraction .",

    "we model the sed as a combination of two seds weighted by the covering fraction ( @xmath119 ) , one representing the temperature of the unspotted photosphere , and the other a 3500 k sed representing the spotted photosphere .",
    "the new best - fit parameters for 15028 including a spot are t@xmath32=4750 k , r=3.1 r@xmath9 , with a 3500 k spot ( or spots ) accounting for 40@xmath19 of the surface area . adding a spot to our model provides a slightly better fit to the photometry and is consistent with the spectroscopically determined @xmath118 of 4800 @xmath30 150 k @xcite . because the spectroscopic temperature was measured in an optical spectral window , the flux from the star would be dominated by the 4750 k surface rather than the 3500 k spot .    similarly , adding a spot to 13008 changes the best - fit parameters to 4750 k and 3.4 r@xmath9 , closer to the 5000 k spectroscopic temperature @xcite .",

    "while this does not fully explain the discrepancy between the photometric and geometric determinations of the radius , it does bring the two radius measurements closer together .",
    "@xcite also observe a flux ratio between 15028 s secondary and primary of 0.35 , much higher than the expected ratio of 0.11 given the spectroscopic temperatures and geometric radii of the primary and secondary .",

    "spot covering fractions for rs cvn have been measured using various methods ( e.g. tio band strength ; @xcite , doppler imaging ; @xcite ) ) these measurements find covering fractions around 30 - 40@xmath19 and sometimes up to 50@xmath19 @xcite , in line with the sed best - fits to the m67 ssgs .",
    "we conclude that if ssgs have a substantial spot covering fraction , the best - fit temperatures from our sed fits in section  [ sec : sedfits ] may be too cool by a few hundred k and our best - fit radii may be too small by a few tenths of a solar radius .",

    "we suggest a similar effect may be at work in the ssgs .    fully modeling the effect of magnetic fields on stellar evolution",
    "requires a 3d magnetic stellar evolution code and is not currently technically feasible .",
    "instead , two main approaches have been used to produce 1d models of magnetically active stars .",
    "one approach is to introduce magnetic perturbations to the stellar structure equations , equation of state , and mixing - length theory of convection ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the other has been to reduce the mixing length coefficient ( @xmath123 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the argument for using a reduced mixing length has been laid out in several papers @xcite . in brief",
    ", the argument assumes that the star possesses a turbulent dynamo that sources energy directly from convective motions .",
    "the moving plasma in a stellar convective region induces a lorentz force that preferentially opposes the movement of fluid across magnetic field lines .",
    "thus the motion of a convective bubble will be slowed as some of its kinetic energy is diverted into the local magnetic field .",
    "for convective motions to be significantly slowed the local alven velocity must approach the convective velocity .",
    "given typical solar values , this requires internal magnetic field strengths of the order @xmath124 g , comparable to the equipartition field expected for rapid rotators .",
    "the result is a reduced heat flux transported by convection , which can be expressed in the framework of mixing length theory as a smaller characteristic convective length scale , or lowered mixing length coefficient @xmath123 .",
    "@xcite simply alter @xmath123 to fit the observed properties of magnetically active stars .",
    "they do not attempt to tie the value of @xmath123 to a specific magnetic field strength or topology .",
    "in complementary work , @xcite compare stellar models with reduced mixing length to models using a slightly different implementation of a turbulent dynamo , as well as to models using a magnetically modified schwarzschild criterion .",
    "they also develop an expression relating the reduction in mixing length to a magnetic field strength .",
    "they find that the reduced mixing length models produce stellar structure nearly identical to their turbulent dynamo models , and that these models can reproduce the observed radius inflation among low mass main sequence stars using plausible internal magnetic field strengths and surface magnetic fields comparable to the observations .",
    "given the exploratory nature of this work , we elect to use the simple and easily implemented approach of @xcite of altering mixing length to match the observed temperatures and radii of the sub - subgiants .",
    "however , the question of how magnetic fields impact stellar structure is far from settled .",
    "we consider this a useful first test , and expect future comparisons with sub - subgiant models using other approaches to implementing magnetic fields in stellar evolution codes will be necessary .      following the approach of @xcite ,",
    "we run a 1.3 m@xmath9  model and a 1.1  m@xmath9  model in mesa using different mixing length coefficients in order to explore the impact this may have on the star s global properties .",
    "mesa s standard mixing length coefficient is @xmath125 .",
    "groups that model this reduced convective efficiency in m - dwarf models found they required @xmath65 to be around 0.5 to reproduce the observed mass - radius relationship derived from m - dwarf eclipsing binaries when assuming a uniform photospheric temperature .",
    "a larger mixing length of @xmath126 was sufficient to reproduce observations when using a two temperature model for the photosphere to account for the effects of starspots to lower surface flux @xcite .    in figure  [ mltmodels ]",

    "also plotted with diamonds are the ssg best - fit radii , temperatures , and luminosity from the sed fitting assuming an unspotted surface ( see section  [ sec : sedfits ] ) .",
    "we compare to the unspotted sed temperature because the mesa models use a single temperature photosphere , and because the spot filling factors for the ssgs are still uncertain .",
    "we also plot for comparison the location of a normal cluster star located at the base of the rgb ( open square ) .",
    "the models indicate that lowering mixing lengths creates cooler , larger stars at all points during the evolution of the star , but the luminosity remains unchanged at most stages of evolution regardless of mixing length .",
    "however , the altered mixing length does create lower luminosity stars near the end of the subgiant branch and the beginning of the rgb . at this stage in evolution ,",
    "the expanding shell absorbs enough energy to lower the luminosity for a time . lowering the mixing length parameter leads to a greater dip in the luminosity here , and",
    "this dip occurs at lower @xmath118 .",
    "the ssgs fall near this dip closest to the @xmath127 track .",
    "we also compare the cmd locations of ssgs to our models with lowered mixing length in figure  [ mltcmd ] .",
    "the color transformation is done using the mesa colors module .",
    "this transformation assumes a uniform , unspotted surface temperature for the star .",
    "a more accurate treatment of the star would be to include both a lowered mixing length coefficient , and to assume a two ( or more ) temperature model for the surface flux that includes contributions from an unspotted photosphere and a spotted region . in fact , the temperature structure may be even more complex , with spots of different temperatures or hot plages surrounding the spots contributing to the emission .",
    "we therefore show the cmd to demonstrate the approximate region in which these lowered mixing length models would appear , but caution that the colors may not be accurate for highly spotted stars .    while these models do move through the ssg region in a b - v or v - i cmd , we have less success producing the specific locations of the ssgs in m67 than in the hr diagram .",
    "these models predict stars that are redder , but brighter than the observed ssgs .",
    "we suggest this discrepancy may be due to our assumption of a single temperature photosphere in the mesa models",
    ". a better measurement of the spot temperatures and covering fraction of the ssgs and a stellar evolution code capable of modeling a spotted photosphere would provide more reliable color transformations . in ngc 6791",
    ", the models do better at reproducing the observed locations of the magnetically active ssgs .",
    "these stars fall between @xmath127 and 1.5 , similar to the results in the hr diagram .",
    "the cmd makes clear that changing mixing length becomes most noticeable near the end of the subgiant branch and through the rgb .",
    "while the tracks show cooler , more expanded stars on the main sequence and early subgiant branch , the spread in the tracks falls within the scatter of stars that fall on a normal isochrone , and therefore would not be noticed based on cmd position alone .",
    "we also expect that the such short - period magnetically active binaries are not observed all the way up the rgb , as they will evolve off the giant branch once they begin roche lobe overflow .",
    "this model therefore predicts we should only observe ssgs in a small region just below or to the red of the lower rgb .",
    "\\1 ) we start with the assumption that the binary fraction for systems with @xmath128 days in both clusters is @xmath0 .",
    "this is the average of binary fractions determined in other wocs clusters of various ages : m35 ( @xmath129 , @xcite ) , ngc 6819 ( @xmath130 , @xcite ) and ngc 188 ( @xmath131 , @xcite ) .",
    "\\2 ) we assume that all binaries with periods less than 18 days ( the longest period ssg in our sample ) will produce magnetic fields on the subgiant branch that cause them to move through the ssg region . the tidal - circularization period for m67",
    "is observed to be @xmath132 days @xcite , so this cutoff seems reasonable .",
    "\\3 ) we adopt the log - normal period distribution observed by @xcite . integrating this distribution , we find that @xmath133 of binaries with @xmath128 days have @xmath134 days .",
    "equivalently , we could say that @xmath135 of all objects are binaries with @xmath134 days .",
    "\\4 ) we count the number of objects observed in each cluster on the later half of the subgiant branch or the lower rgb .",
    "these are the areas predicted by mesa models to appear underluminous due to magnetic fields .",
    "in m67 , where we have 3d kinematic memberships , we just count the number of stars in this region and find 20 . in ngc 6791 , we only have proper motion memberships . here",
    "we take all members with p@xmath136 from @xcite .",
    "we correct for field contamination using the result of @xcite that @xmath137 of the @xmath138 stars are confirmed as rv members .",
    "we find 100 members in our region of interest .",
    "\\5 ) multiplying our number of stars by @xmath139 , we expect to find 0.55 ssgs in m67 and 2.75 ssgs in ngc 6791 formed through this mechanism .",
    "\\6 ) we calculate the cumulative poisson probability to determine our odds of observing ssgs in m67 and ngc 6791 .",
    "we find that the chance of observing 1 or more magnetic ssgs in m67 is @xmath140 .",
    "the chance of observing 1 or more magnetic ssgs ngc 6791 is @xmath141 .",
    "the chance of observing 2 magnetic ssgs in m67 is @xmath18 , while the chance of observing 4 magnetic ssgs in ngc 6791 is @xmath142 .",
    "if we assume that only 3 of the 4 ssgs are magnetic since the 4th shows no signs of binarity or magnetic activity , we find a @xmath130 chance of observing 3 magnetic ssgs in ngc 6791 .",
    "we conclude that if this magnetic field mechanism can indeed create stars in the ssg cmd region , it is likely that several of the stars in our sample are created in this way .",
    "here we put forth three hypotheses of ssg formation : 1 ) mass transfer in a binary system , 2 ) stripping of a subgiant s envelope , and 3 ) reduced luminosity due to magnetic fields that inhibit convection and produce large stellar spots .",
    "we demonstrate that stellar models for each of these methods evolve through the ssg domain .",
    "models of mass transfer in binaries containing subgiant stars can produce binary systems with combined light in the ssg cmd region .",
    "this requires binary systems with orbital periods around 1 day as they evolve along the subgiant branch , as longer period binaries begin rlo once they have started ascending the rgb and do not move through the ssg region .",
    "additionally , the binary must have a small enough secondary that the secondary light does not push the combined light into a more populated cmd region ( i.e. the blue straggler domain ) . due to these restrictions on period and secondary mass ,",
    "ssgs formed through mass transfer are expected to be rare , and we would not expect to see many , if any , in open clusters .",
    "however , with a larger sample of subgiant stars , e.g. in a massive globular cluster , we may observe ssgs formed in such a way .",
    "furthermore , mass transfer models produce binaries with shorter periods than the observed orbital periods of the ssgs in m67 and ngc 6791 .",
    "we test the tidally enhanced wind model of @xcite , and find that even with this elevated wind mass loss we can not achieve the necessary mass loss rates to produce ssgs with the observed periods .",
    "mesa models in which several tenths of a solar mass of material is rapidly stripped from a subgiant s envelope can also produce stars in the ssg domain .",
    "we conjecture that this may happen during grazing dynamical encounters in which a star passes close enough to tidally strip material from a subgiant s envelope but avoids merging .",
    "additional scattering experiments and hydrodynamic simulations are necessary to determine if this mechanism is viable , and if binaries with @xmath143 day orbital periods are an expected end product of such an interaction . as an upper limit on formation rate , we assume that all single - binary or binary - binary encounters with subgiants lead to the formation of ssgs .",
    "even with this very optimistic assumption , the expected rates of formation in open clusters are low enough that we would not expect to observe such stars in m67 or ngc 6791 .",
    "ssgs may also form as the result of main - sequence collisions during dynamical encounters , but this too should be rare in open clusters . as with mass transfer , this may be a more relevant formation mechanism in massive globular clusters where encounter rates are higher and there are larger populations of subgiant stars , a possibility we investigate in another paper ( geller et al .",
    "2017b , in preparation ) .",
    "while envelope stripping during dynamical encounters and roche lobe overflow perhaps produce ssgs infrequently , clearly substantial mass loss from a subgiant star can create stars in the ssg cmd region .",
    "there may be other mass loss mechanisms that we have not explored that create ssgs more frequently , such as common envelope evolution .",
    "stellar magnetic fields in - and - of themselves may be sufficient to explain the anomalous luminosities and colors of sub - subgiants .",
    "five of our six ssgs show spot variability , x - rays , and h@xmath65 emission indicative of surface magnetic activity .",
    "research in the field of low - mass eclipsing binaries suggests magnetic fields can cause inflated radii and lower effective temperatures .",
    "the seds of the ssgs suggest that the stars do have lower temperatures than normal subgiants in the clusters .",
    "simple 1d models of stars with reduced mixing lengths can fairly well reproduce the observed temperatures , radii , and luminosities of the systems .",
    "we have less success matching the models to the ssg cmd locations , which may be a consequence of assuming a single temperature photosphere when performing the color transformation .",
    "a stellar evolution code that allows for a multi - temperature photosphere is necessary to test these results and produce more accurate model colors , as are better measurements of spot temperatures and covering fractions ( e.g. using tio bands ) .    a calculation of the frequency with which magnetic fields should produce these stars yields an expectation of at least one such star in ngc 6791 , and possibly one in m67 .",
    "the formation frequencies indicate that several of the ssgs in our sample could likely have formed in this way , with a probability of a few percent that all five ssgs showing signs of magnetic activity could have been produced by this mechanism .",
    "the sixth ssg shows no signs of magnetic activity or binarity , and we conclude this mechanism is not likely to explain the origin of this system .    of course , these lowered - mixing length models are simplistic and do not include a physical treatment of the interaction between magnetic fields and convection . without full 3d magnetic stellar evolution codes , fully implementing all the required physics is impossible , but several other stellar evolution codes use other approaches to model the effects of magnetic fields on evolution @xcite . comparing the results of these codes to our models would be a useful test of our approach .",
    "finally , the discovery of more ssg sb2 binaries or eclipsing binaries in order to infer masses would be an excellent test .",
    "while the magnetic field hypothesis requires ssgs to be similar in mass to normal cluster subgiants , mass - loss mechanisms such as mass transfer in a binary or envelope stripping require significant amounts of mass loss to produce ssgs .",
    "a sample of ssg systems in which the mass could be well determined would be a strong test of which hypothesis is best .",
