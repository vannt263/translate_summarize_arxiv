    "in place of coarsely - defined fit functions to numerical solutions of the thomson problem , the discrete derivative of these fit functions has been demonstrated to correspond with the well - defined configuration of @xmath0 charges on a unit sphere surrounding an @xmath1th charge , @xmath11 , at its origin followed by relaxation of this volumetric problem to each subsequent @xmath1-charge solution of the thomson problem .",
    "this approach provides useful new information about the discrete charge system not obtained by the insufficient mathematical description of coarse fit functions previously used to model solutions of the thomson problem .",
    "the existence of possibly better fit functions based on the underlying physical properties of the charge system described may lead to better approximations and potentially exact solutions of the thomson problem which appears to be intrinsically shared with atomic structure .",

    "further developments toward exact solutions of this transformation are merited , substantiated by its many correspondences with electron shell - filling in atomic structure , and its usefulness to a wide range of other discrete charge modeling applications .",
