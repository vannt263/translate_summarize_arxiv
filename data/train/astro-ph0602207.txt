    "studies with _ xmm - newton _ ( jenkins et al .",
    "2004 ) point to a heterogeneous class of objects whose spectral properties are similar to those of objects with lower x - ray luminosities . detailed studies with _ chandra _ and _ xmm _ and the identification of counterparts in other spectral ranges ( optical / infrared / radio ) are essential for making progress in the field .",
    "the number of such optical identifications is still limited ( e.g.  roberts et al .",
    "2001 ; wu et al .  2002",
    "; liu et al .  2004 ) .",
    "some of the these counterparts have revealed objects at higher redshift than the putative parent galaxies ( maseti et al .",
    "2003 ; clark et al .",
    "2005 ) , and are viewed in standard big bang cosmology as contaminated background objects .",

    "the statistical analysis of the objects in the cp02 catalogue made by irwin et al .",
    "( 2004 ) indicates considerable contamination by background sources .",
    "a direct confirmation of these and a better understanding on the nature of ulx sources can be achieved by identifying counterparts in other bands ( in particular in the optical , as is widely recognized : see for instance the review by van der marel 2004 ) .",
    "this motivated us to start this study searching for such possible optical counterparts in the major existing optical surveys .",
    "for example , we have identified possible optical counterparts in the dss plates for about @xmath050% of the objects compiled by cp02 .",
    "the typical magnitudes of such objects are 1720 in the @xmath4 band and are therefore bright enough targets for spectroscopic observations with 2 to 4 m telescopes . in previous work",
    "( arp et al .  2004 : gutirrez & lpez - corredoira 2005 ) we have demonstrated the feasibility of such studies and present our first results with the identification and characterization of nine such _ rosat _ ulx sources . in eight cases",
    "the sources look point - like and turned out to be quasars at high redshift .",
    "the remaining object was in a spiral arm of ngc  1073 and is apparently embedded in an hii region . here ,",
    "we present further results with an analysis of the counterparts of four additional ulx sources .",
    "in this paper we consider the cases of ixo  32 , 35 , 37 and 40 ( we follow the notation by cp02 ) .",
    "table  1 summarizes the main properties of such sources ( taken from the compilation by cp02 ) .",
    "we look for possible optical counterparts of these x - ray sources in the digital sky survey ( dss ) plates , the usno catalogue , and the released sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data . for the four cases we checked that there are point - like objects compatible with the x - ray positions .",
    "the last column in table  1 lists the offset between the optical and x - ray coordinates .",
    "the fields around ixo  32 , 35 and 37 were also observed with the iac80 telescope in may 2004 and december 2005 . for these objects we took single exposures of 1800 s in @xmath5 for ixo  32 , 600 s in @xmath6 for ixo35 , and 600 s in @xmath7 for ixo  37 .",
    "the observations were reduced using iraf following a standard procedure the nights were photometric and we use landolt stars ( landolt 1992 ) to perform an absolute calibration with an uncertainty of ( 2@xmath8 ) @xmath9 mag in each filter .",
    "figure  1 show the images with the identification of the optical counterpart .",
    "the images ( 2@xmath10 @xmath11 2@xmath10 ) are centred on the nominal x - ray positions . in one case ( ixo  32 ) there is another source slightly shifted ( 12 arcsec ) from the x - ray coordinates .",
    "the spectroscopic observations presented here were taken in february 2004 with the wht .",
    "we used the blue and the red arms of the isis spectrograph with the r300b and r158r grisms .",
    "the slit width was 2 arcsec .",
    "we took a cu  ar and cu  ne lamp with a slitwidth of 1 arcsec at the beginning of the night for wavelength calibration .",
    "the stability of the wavelength calibration during the night and pointing was checked using the main sky lines .",
    "the sampling was 1.71   and 3.26   in the blue and red arms respectively .",
    "for each target , a single image was taken with exposure times of 1800 s for the counterparts of ixo  32 , 37 and 40 , and 900 s for the counterpart of ixo  35 .",
    "the spectra were analysed following a standard procedure using iraf of bias subtraction , extraction of the spectra and wavelength calibration .",
    "we used the standard spectroscopic star feige  34 ( oke 1990 ) to correct for the response of the configuration to different wavelengths .",
    "the star was observed only three times during two nights and the slit for the targets was not positioned at parallactic angles , so this correction is only indicative .",
    "given the prohibitive time needed to secure flat field images ( specially in the blue part of the spectra ) , we did not correct for that effect .",
    "however , we have checked that this correction would be very small ( @xmath12 % ) .",
    "none of these uncertainties is relevant for the analysis and results presented in this paper .",
    "the spectra of the four objects are presented in figure  2 .",
    "the four spectra show features that allow clear identification and characterization .",
    "table  2 lists the main properties of these spectra .",
    "the analysis of each object is presented below .",
    "this source is also listed in the lb05 catalogue as x06 ( around the galaxy ngc  2775 ) .",
    "the optical images show two point - like objects with a separation @xmath07 arcsec and distant @xmath05 and @xmath012 arcsec respectively from the nominal x - ray position . only the brightest ( the object at @xmath012 arcsec ) is listed in the usno catalogue .",
    "we put the slit crossing both objects .",
    "the spectrum of the bright object has typical absorption lines of a star being the most prominent absorption features , the h & k caii , and the balmer lines .",

    "after the spectroscopic observations we discovered that the field has been observed with sdss and that the object situated at 3.2 arcsecs from the nominal cp02 x - ray position has been catalogued as a star with with magnitudes @xmath16 mag and @xmath17 mag .",
    "this object is also listed in the lb05 catalogue and denoted as ngc  3226 x03 .",
    "the usno catalogue lists an object with magnitudes @xmath18 mag and @xmath19 mag at 2.8 and 2.1 arcsec from the cp02 and lb05 x - ray positions respectively .",
    "the observations taken with the iac80 telescope show a point - like object with magnitudes 18.87 , 17.97 , 16.65 and 14.79 in the @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath7 and @xmath22 bands respectively .",
    "the nearest neighbour listed in the usno catalogue and detected with the iac80 at @xmath23 mag is @xmath027 arcsec se .",
    "the source is also listed in 2mass with magnitudes 13.24 , 12.70 and 12.39 in the @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 bands respectively . according to the maps by schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , possible corrections for galactic extinction are below 0.1 mag in the blue band .",
    "the optical spectrum of this object is dominated by strong absorption bands ( vo , na and tio ) typical of a cold star . we detect also the ca h and k and balmer emission lines ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) , although some of them are in the middle of absorption bands , making the estimation of equivalent widths uncertain . following the calibration by hawley et al.(2002 ) , based on several photometric and spectroscopic indices , we classify the object as an m36 star . from this and with the magnitude in the @xmath24 band it is possible to estimate the distance and then the x - ray luminosity .",
    "the resulting distance is in the range 41 pc ( for an m6 type ) to 157 pc ( for an m3 type ) , which corresponds to x - ray luminosities of @xmath29 and @xmath30 erg s@xmath3 respectively .",
    "these luminosities are within the range found by schmitt & liefke ( 2004 ) for a volume - limited sample of nearby m stars .",
    "the object is also listed in the lb05 catalogue with the name x02 around the galaxy ic  2597 .",
    "a possible counterpart at a distance of @xmath04 arcsec from the x - ray source appears in the optical images having a magnitude of 19.44 in @xmath7 in the observations at the iac80 telescope .",
    "the spectrum is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "we identify the forbidden narrow emission line oii(@xmath31 3727  ) and oiii(@xmath31 4959 , 5007 ) as the most important features .",
    "the redshift is @xmath32 . at this redshift",
    "the h@xmath13 lies at @xmath07617  , which we identify as a bump in the middle of a telluric line .",
    "we also identify @xmath33 at 10294   in a spectral region ( not shown in the figure ) of low sensitivity of the detector and severely contaminated by sky emission lines .",
    "other emission lines in the red arm are from neiii ( @xmath34 ) . correcting the spectrum for redshift , we detect in the blue arm the mgii(@xmath35  ) emission line . the impossibility to measure the flux of the h@xmath13 and h@xmath14 lines",
    "precludes the application of the common diagnostic diagrams .",
    "however , based on the x - ray emission , we classsify this object as a seyfert",
    "i , agn      dss plates show only a possible optical counterpart of this ulx at @xmath02 arcsec from the nominal x - ray position and with magnitudes 17.9 and 19.1 in @xmath36 and @xmath4 respectively .",
    "the optical spectrum shows emission lines typical of agn / qsos .",
    "the main features are broad emissions of ciii(1909  ) and mgii ( 2799  ) in the blue arm .",
    "oii(@xmath31 3727  ) , neiii(@xmath31 3869  ) and possibly oiii(@xmath31 4959 , 5007 ) are detected in the red .",
    "the resulting redshift is @xmath37 .",
    "the poor spatial resolution of _ rosat _ images is irrelevant for the optical identifications presented here .",
    "in fact , as discussed in gutirrez & lpez - corredoira ( 2005 ) , the low density of bright quasars ( @xmath02 - 3 per square degree brighter than 19 mag ) makes unlikely a chance projection between the x - ray sources and the quasars identified as the optical counterparts of ixo  32 , 37 and 40 . a similar argument can be applied in the case of ixo  35 : from the local density of m stars ( martini & osmer 1998 ) , we have estimated that the probability to have randomly a source at @xmath38 arcsecs from the x - ray nominal position is below @xmath39 .",
    "these simple arguments confirm the reliability of our identifications . the sample analyzed in this paper suffer of several biases and",
    "then can not be considered as statistical representative of the whole sample of ulxs listed in the cp02 catalogue .",
    "in fact , the objects selected are restricted to those with a bright point - like optical counterpart ( @xmath40 mag ) .",
    "so , for instance we have excluded a priori the possibility to detect x - ray binary stars within the parent galaxy .",
    "the objects were also selected to be in relatively isolated regions that allow an unambiguous identification .",
    "this is against the detection of objects within star forming complexes .",
    "the statistical implications of these and other identifications are in progress and will be addressed in a forthcoming paper ( lpez - corredoira & gutirrez a&a submitted ) . in any case",
    "the results presented here reinforce the importance of multiwavelength studies of these x - ray sources as one of the most promising ways to disentangle the nature of these objects and for the construction of clean samples of ulx sources for further studies .",
    "the author is especially grateful to m. lpez - corredoira , a close collaborator in this project , for useful suggestions and comments .",
    "we thank also j. a. caballero for useful hints about the properties of the m star identified as possible counterpart of ixo  35 .",
