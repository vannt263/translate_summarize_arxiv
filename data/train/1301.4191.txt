    "an intriguing consequence of quantum physics is that the strength of fundamental forces depends on the energy scale at which they are probed .",
    "the energy - dependence of couplings then teaches us how quantum fluctuations modify the laws of physics when moving from largest to smallest energies .",
    "it is commonly believed that couplings should approach a fixed point at highest energies for a quantum field theory to exist fundamentally @xcite .",
    "such theories are then said to be either asymptotically free , if the fixed point is of a non - interacting type , or asymptotically safe @xcite , otherwise .",
    "a role model for a fundamental and asymptotically free theory in four dimensions is quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the theory of the strong nuclear force .",
    "it describes the interaction of colored matter fields , the quarks , with the carrier of the nuclear force , the gluons .",
    "classically , the coupling constant of the strong force @xmath0 is marginal .",
    "quantum - mechanically , the fluctuations of the quark and the gluon fields turn the coupling into an energy - dependent running coupling . in the high - energy limit",
    ", qcd is weakly coupled and approaches a free ultraviolet fixed point @xmath1 .",
    "asymptotic freedom has the additional benefit that canonical power counting is applicable .",
    "the knowledge that only a few relevant or marginal invariants persist at high energies is at the root of reliable approximations and predictions within continuum and lattice studies of qcd .",
    "a candidate for a fundamental and asymptotically safe theory in four dimensions is gravity @xcite .",
    "it describes the interactions of matter with the carrier of the gravitational force , the metric field .",
    "classically , newton s coupling is a constant .",
    "quantum - mechanically , metric fluctuations give rise to an energy - dependence of couplings and , possibly , a fixed point at high energies . similarly to qcd , this would then provide a link between the high- and the low - energy regimes by following the renormalization group ( rg ) evolution of couplings . on the other hand , and very much unlike qcd ,",
    "the metric couplings are expected to reach an interacting rather than a free high energy fixed point .",
    "this innocuous - looking difference between asymptotic freedom and asymptotic safety has the profound implication that the set of relevant and marginal invariants is no longer known beforehand .",
    "the asymptotic safety conjecture thus seems to require novel search strategies beyond perturbation theory .    in this letter we put forward a self - consistent strategy to test the asymptotic safety conjecture .",
    "our approach compensates the lack of beforehand information with the help of a bootstrap .",
    "thereby , it also gives access to the scaling dimensions of the theory at a fixed point , which are worked out for the example of @xmath2-type theories of gravity .",
    "we focus on the main ideas and results , and leave technicalities for a seperate publication @xcite .",
    "we recall the asymptotic safety conjecture following the ideas of s.  weinberg for the example of gravity @xcite . to that end , we consider a wilsonian effective action for four - dimensional euclidean gravity of the form @xmath3 where the terms @xmath4 are built out of the metric field and its covariant derivatives in accordance with diffeomorphism invariance , and @xmath5 are the corresponding couplings .",
    "the couplings and the effective action also depend on the rg momentum scale @xmath6 . under the rg evolution of parameters ,",
    "the effective action should approach the einstein - hilbert action at low energies @xmath7 to recover classical general relativity , [ s ] d^4x , where @xmath8 is newton s constant , @xmath9 the vacuum energy , @xmath10 the ricci scalar , and @xmath11 . at high energies",

    ", gravity remains interacting yet the running newton coupling @xmath15 becomes very small compared to its classical value @xmath16 @xcite . an asymptotically safe rg trajectory @xmath17 then connects the ultraviolet and infrared limits of gravity inasmuch as it does for asymptotically free theories , eg .",
    "qcd .    in addition",
    ", the feasibility of asymptotic safety also hinges on the residual interactions at the putative fixed point , which can be understood as follows @xcite . denoting the canonical mass dimension of the couplings as @xmath18=d_i$ ] ,",
    "we introduce dimensionless couplings @xmath19 .",
    "if the term @xmath4 in the effective action contains @xmath20 derivatives of the metric field , we have @xmath21 .",
    "note that we adopt conventions where the metric field is dimensionless , and covariant derivatives have mass dimension one , but our conclusions will be independent thereof . in these conventions , the rg scale dependence of couplings is given by @xmath22 .",
    "the dimensionless couplings become independent of the rg scale @xmath23 if @xmath24 and the theory is said to be at a fixed point .",
    "linearizing in its vicinity , we find @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the stability matrix .",
    "integrating , the general solution takes the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 are the eigenvalues of @xmath29 , @xmath30 the corresponding eigenvectors , and @xmath31 free parameters .",
    "the significance of is as follows : in order to have a well - defined ultraviolet limit the irrelevant eigendirections which would diverge for @xmath32 , i.e.  those with positive @xmath33 , must vanish , implying that the coefficients @xmath34 .",
    "this condition defines the ultraviolet critical surface of asymptotically safe gravity .",
    "the relevant eigendirections with @xmath35 are unconstrained and the corresponding coefficients @xmath31 are free parameters of the theory .",
    "provided that the number of relevant directions with @xmath35 remains finite , this leads to a predictive theory with a finite number of free parameters whose values should be fixed by experiment .",
    "we note that since the stability matrix @xmath36 is real but not manifestly symmetric , some eigenvalues may come out as complex conjugate pairs",
    ". then the sign of the real part determines whether the associated scaling fields are relevant .",
    "we conclude from this discussion that the set of eigenvalues @xmath37 , and in particular the subset of relevant and marginal ones , are a crucial ingredient for asymptotically safe theories .",
    "for asymptotically free theories , canonical power counting fixes the set of eigenvalues @xmath37 without further ado , and their values can be read off from in the weak coupling limit @xcite [ da ] _",

    "the fluctuation - induced terms involve higher powers in the couplings and the set of gaussian eigenvalues are ( minus ) the canonical mass dimension of the couplings @xmath38 . for",
    "asymptotically safe theories , residual interactions modify the eigenvalues . to test the asymptotic safety conjecture ,",
    "a strategy is required which reliably determines the fixed point  provided it exists  and the set of scaling exponents @xmath37 . unlike in asymptotically free theories , it is not known _ a priori _ which invariants will turn out to be relevant , marginal , or irrelevant at a fixed point . as such , the lack of beforehand information may hamper the reliability of fixed point studies , as these often have to adopt some approximation for . on the other hand ,",
    "it is conceivable that the residual interactions only change the sign of , at best , finitely many eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "if so , the relevancy of invariants at an interacting fixed point would continue to be governed by their canonical mass dimension .    in this light",
    ", it is tempting to compensate the absence of prior knowledge by an iterative strategy : under the working hypothesis that invariants with a larger canonical mass dimension remain less relevant even in the interacting case , the action is approximated by a few terms @xmath4 up to a pre - set maximum canonical mass dimension @xmath39 , say @xmath40\\le d$ ] ( step 1 ) .",
    "the impact of interactions on the universal scaling exponents is then quantified using suitable methods eg .",
    "wilson s rg in the continuum , lattice simulations , or holography ( step 2 ) . within the rg ,",
    "this amounts to the explicit derivation of rg flows for all couplings , the search for interacting ultraviolet fixed point(s ) in terms of these , and the computation of the corresponding set of non - perturbative eigenvalues @xmath37 .",
    "finally , we increase the pre - set maximum @xmath39  and thus the set of invariants and couplings retained in  and re - do the previous analysis ( step 3 ) .",
    "in fact , the iteration of step 2 and 3 is crucial as it offers a systematic control of which invariants are responsible for the values of scaling exponents , and whether their magnitudes continue to be governed by the canonical mass dimension . if the initial assumption is confirmed to sufficiently high order , the self - consistency of the working hypothesis is validated _ a posteriori_. if the strategy fails even to high orders in the iteration , and it may do so in a variety of manners , the working hypothesis is refuted .",
    "we now apply our strategy to a simplified version of quantum gravity also relevant for cosmology @xcite , where the action is taken to be a local function of the ricci scalar only . in step 1",
    "we specify the terms @xmath41 in as powers of the ricci scalar @xmath42 , @xmath43 the ricci scalar contains two derivatives of the metric field and the gaussian exponents in this theory are [ g ] \\{_g , n=2n-4 ,  0nn-1}. classically the theory has two relevant and a marginal coupling associated to the vacuum energy , the ricci scalar , and the @xmath44 term .",
    "the canonical mass dimensions of the terms in are bounded by @xmath45\\le d=2(n-1)$ ] . for step 2 ,",
    "we adopt wilson s rg @xcite for the gravitational action .",
    "the rg flows for all couplings in are obtained using techniques developed in @xcite , also adding suitable gauge - fixing and ghost terms within the background field formalism in the conventions of @xcite .",
    "we then fix @xmath46 , identify the interacting fixed points , and compute the set of @xmath46 universal eigenvalues [ theta ] \\{_n(n ) ,  0nn-1 } which characterise the critical theory .",
    "the eigenvalues are ordered according to magnitude ( of their real parts , if complex ) . in step 3",
    "we then increase @xmath39 , which is equivalent to increasing @xmath47 , perform a new fixed point search , compute the scaling exponents , and compare with results at lower @xmath46 .",
    "we have iterated our procedure from @xmath48 to @xmath49 .",
    "a numerically stable fixed point is found to each and every order .",
    "earlier results up to order @xmath50 @xcite and @xmath51 @xcite are reproduced , and serve as an important consistency check .",
    "occasionally , a spurious fixed point is found at a few specific orders , which is discarded .",
    "0.001    ( 1000,1530 ) ( 0,0 ) the complete sets of eigenvalues at the ultraviolet fixed point for all @xmath46 , sorted by magnitude .",

[ scalingw2 ] for 34 consecutive orders @xmath46 .",
    "we find that the theory has three relevant ( negative ) eigenvalues with @xmath35 . for fixed @xmath55",
    ", we note a good convergence of @xmath53 with increasing approximation order @xmath46 .",
    "we also note the occasional appearance of complex conjugate pairs of eigenvalues , in which case we have plotted their real parts .",
    "complex eigenvalues hint towards a degeneracy induced by strong correlations . in a more complete treatment these degeneracies may be lifted through interactions beyond those retained here , eg .",
    "weyl tensor invariants @xcite or dynamical ghosts @xcite . note also that if the largest eigenvalues @xmath56 and @xmath57 per data set are a complex conjugate pair , their real parts tend to deviate more strongly from their asymptotic values .",
    "the reason for this is that the values of the largest exponents per approximation order are sensitive to the couplings neglected at order @xmath46 , eg .  @xmath58 or higher .",
    "this pattern is well - known from analogous studies of critical scalar theories @xcite .",
    "in fact , as soon as the next few couplings are taken into account , the exponent converges well , see fig .",
    "[ scalingw2 ] . to conclude , the main result of fig .  [ scalingw2 ] is that the ordering of scaling exponents is indeed controlled by the underlying canonical dimension even at an interacting fixed point , thus supporting the working hypothesis .",
    "we now turn to the large - order behavior of scaling exponents .",
    "since the eigenvalues appear to be growing linearly with @xmath55 , we perform a least - square fit of as [ shift ] _",
    "n an - b for 24 data sets with @xmath59 . for each fit",
    ", we omit the two largest values in for reasons detailed above .",

    "the smallness of the estimated error in @xmath61 permits an extrapolation of the result , towards higher @xmath55 .",
    "we therefore have good reason to expect that higher order terms such as @xmath62 continue to be irrelevant as a consequence of residual interactions .    the differences between and the gaussian coefficients @xmath63 and @xmath64 serve as an indicator for the non - perturbative corrections due to asymptotically safe interactions . interestingly ,",
    "our results show that the scaling exponents remain near - gaussian .",
    "the off - set @xmath65 is compatible with the classical value , though with a slight bias towards larger values , whereas the slope @xmath61 comes out larger than the gaussian slope .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that this may be a consequence of the smallness of newton s coupling at an ultraviolet fixed point , though more work is required to clarify this aspect .",
    "we have put forward a strategy to test the asymptotic safety conjecture by means of a bootstrap to compensate for the _ a priori _ unknown scaling exponents .",
    "the price to pay is the necessity for a non - perturbative analysis of the fixed point at each and every order in the iteration .",
    "unfortunately , it is not guaranteed that the procedure succeeds .",
    "if it does , however , the benefits would seem plentiful , including the prospect of a systematic control towards asymptotically safe quantum field theories .",
    "the procedure has been applied for a simplified version of quantum gravity .",
    "up to very high order , the model displays a stable ultraviolet fixed point and a self - consistent set of universal eigenvalues .",
    "the main qualitative effect of residual interactions is the occurence of an additional negative eigenvalue in the spectrum , @xmath66 .",
