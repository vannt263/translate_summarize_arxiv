    "in a bipartite system @xmath154 , quantification of entanglement between the two subsystems has been intensively studied in the last decade . when the density matrix of the overall system @xmath116 is pure then the von neumann entropy of the subsystem , namely @xmath155 where @xmath46 is the reduced density matrix of the subsystem @xmath19 , is a unique measure of entanglement and all other measures are monotonic functions of the von neumann entropy . at variance ,",
    "when the overall state @xmath116 is mixed the von neumann entropy fails to quantify the entanglement between the two subsystems . in such cases one can use negativity as a pertinent measure of entanglement , defined as @xcite @xmath156 where the @xmath118 s are the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath119 ( or @xmath157 ) in which @xmath120 ( or @xmath158 ) stands for partial transpose with respect to the subsystem @xmath19 ( or @xmath159 ) . if the density matrix @xmath116 is separable , then both @xmath119 and @xmath157 remain positive and thus @xmath160 for all @xmath161 s which results in zero negativity in eq .",
    "( [ negativity_definition ] ) . in contrast , if the overall state @xmath116 is entangled then some of the @xmath118 s become negative and thus the negativity in eq .",
    "( [ negativity_definition ] ) becomes nonzero .",
    "negativity as a measure of entanglement , applicable for both pure and mixed states , is an entanglement monotone which means that it does not increase under local operations .",
    "furthermore , negativity is a legitimate quantum mechanical observable in the sense that it is associated with a hermitian operator as @xmath162 where @xmath163 s are the eigenvectors of the matrix @xmath119 .",
    "so , one can easily show that @xmath164",
    "the spin - chain representation of the spin sector of the two - channel kondo model was first introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . to further justify this representation",
    ", we here provide a conformal field theory analysis .",
    "+ by folding the system in half , creating an open boundary at the impurity site @xmath165 , the left and right parts of the spin chain come to define two  channels `` on the interval @xmath166 $ ] , where @xmath53 is the lattice spacing . introducing slowly varying left / right - moving su(2)@xmath167 spin currents @xmath168 , together with two su(2)@xmath167 wess - zumino - witten matrix fields @xmath169 @xcite , the representation @xmath170 can then be used in the continuum limit to map the folded @xmath17 system onto the spin sector of the two - channel kondo model @xcite . since the two channels ( a.k.a .",
    "spin chains ) both couple to the impurity , the expected chiral su(2)@xmath171 su(2)@xmath167 symmetry of the critical theory in absence of the impurity gets replaced by su(2)@xmath172 , where the ising symmetry group @xmath173 encodes the presence of the two channels .",
    "this conformal embedding is different from the one used for the original two - channel kondo model @xcite , and reflects the fact that the two underlying bulk theories are different : in the two - channel kondo model one is dealing with non - interacting electrons with two orbital channels , whereas in its spin - chain representation the impurity host is that of a one - dimensional half - filled hubbard model ( with charge gapped out ) and with only a single orbital . the ising @xmath173 sector comes into play only off the two - channel kondo critical point , and then contributes a leading scaling operator of the same dimension as that from the ' ' flavor \" sector in the conformal embedding used for the two - channel kondo model @xcite .",
    "this testifies to the consistency of the spin chain representation .",
    "note that the total central charge implied by the spin - chain representation on a half - line , @xmath174 , becomes halved , @xmath57 , when doubling the spatial degrees of freedom by unfolding the system back to the full interval @xmath175 $ ] .",
    "the unfolded geometry is the one used in our dmrg computations , cf .",
    "in most studies of the 2ck model there is no interaction between the two channels ; however , for the results presented in fig 2 the two channels are coupled through the periodic boundary conditions . for the remainder of the results presented",
    "this is not the case .",
    "as long as @xmath48 this should not affect the results for large enough @xmath43 since in the limit @xmath126 results have to be independent of this boundary condition . obviously , once @xmath47 approaches @xmath176 there is no reason to expect that we should correctly represent 2ck physics .",
    "this can for instance be seen in the inset of fig .",
    "2(b ) where @xmath177 does not approach @xmath178 as @xmath47 approaches @xmath176 .",
    "it is then reasonable to ask why we use periodic boundary conditions since numerically it would be simpler to use open boundary conditions .",
    "reason for this is that the correction to scaling terms appearing in eq .",
    "( 9 ) , proportional to @xmath88 , are well understood  @xcite .",
    "these terms are more correctly seen as arising from 1ck physics associated with the open boundary in the left panel of fig .",
    "2(b ) . in the presence of open boundary conditions several other terms",
    "would appear dominating the 2ck physics we are trying to study and it is therefore a significant advantage to employ the periodic boundary conditions as was done in fig .",
    "2 . furthermore",
    ", we note that @xmath42 as defined in eq .",
    "( 2 ) approach a completely uniform chain in the limit @xmath73 which is another advantage when extracting @xmath2 . for the results presented in figs .",
    "3,4 the above advantages of using @xmath42 are not pertinent and we have therefore used the more standard @xmath39 .",
    "as discussed in the main text @xmath179 using eq .  ( 4 ) and ( 7 ) .",

    "<S> it is expected that the ground state is overscreened only at @xmath17 where the impurity is entangled with both channels . for any @xmath122 in the thermodynamic limit </S>",

    "<S> the interpretation of the negativity as an order parameter can be justified by a finite - size scaling analysis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an order parameter scales as @xmath127 in the vicinity of the critical point and the correlation length as @xmath128 , where @xmath129 and @xmath130 are critical exponents . </S>",
    "<S> the role of a correlation length is here taken by the critical crossover scale @xmath131 at which the renormalization - group flow of the channel - asymmetric model crosses over from the unstable overscreened fixed point to the fully screened kondo fixed point @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finite - size scaling @xcite implies that @xmath132 with @xmath133 a scaling function . in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> inspired by tangle  @xcite and its generalization for negativity  @xcite , as tripartite entanglement measures for qubits , we introduce a tripartite entanglement indicator as @xmath145 in which @xmath146 where @xmath147 and @xmath148 represent opposite channels , @xmath149 is the negativity of the impurity with the rest of the system , @xmath150 is the negativity between the impurity and channel @xmath25 , and @xmath151 is the negativity between the two channels . for systems with _ odd </S>",
