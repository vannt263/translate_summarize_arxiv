    "the recent discovery of graphene  @xcite , a flat monolayer of carbon atoms tightly packed into a two - dimensional ( 2d ) honeycomb lattice , has attracted great attention , in particular after the experimental observation of a non standard sequence of integer quantum hall features  @xcite .",
    "graphene is the first truly 2d system available for investigation by solid state physicists .",
    "the unusual sequence of integer quantum hall features is related to the quasi - relativistic nature of the charge carriers due to the particular graphene band structure near the dirac point  @xcite . in graphene",
    "the conventional integer quantum hall quantization for the conductivity @xmath2 is shifted by a half integer  @xcite due to the half - filling of the @xmath3 landau level compared to the other levels : @xmath4 at very high magnetic fields and with high quality samples more quantum hall plateaus not in the sequence of eq.([sigmahall ] ) have been observed  @xcite ; these include filling factors @xmath5 and the fractional quantum hall effect has been also observed in suspended graphene samples  @xcite with an insulating phase in the state @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "these new plateaus can not be understood only by using the landau quantization and their origin is currently a topic under a considerable debate .",
    "many theories attribute the origin of these new plateaus to some spontaneously broken symmetry of the system driven by electron - electron interactions ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "edge states could also play a key role and their relevance for the dynamics in graphene  @xcite has been invoked to explain a variety of magneto - transport experiments near @xmath6 .",
    "different measurements have demonstrated that the longitudinal resistance may either decrease  @xcite or increase  @xcite at @xmath7 with decreasing temperature in samples that appear to be quite similar , fueling the debate concerning the existence and origin of an insulator phase near the dirac point at high magnetic fields .",
    "this insulator phase has been attributed to field - induced spin - density waves in non - suspended graphene samples  @xcite .",
    "our data shows clearly a transition to an insulator phase at high magnetic fields being consistent with the results by checkelsky _",

    "the underlying physics is the anderson localization - delocalization quantum phase transition  @xcite . in this work",
    "we report experimental evidence for a pi transition between states at filling factors @xmath9 and @xmath6 .",
    "we have obtained a value for the scaling exponent equal to @xmath10 , to our knowledge , the first evidence of this exponent in a truly 2d system .",
    "the value we found for @xmath8 is very similar to the values measured for this exponent for the plateau - insulator transition in standard quasi two - dimensional electron gases ( 2degs ) in ingaas / inp and ingaas / gaas quantum wells ( see  @xcite and  @xcite for a complete review ) .",

    "unfortunately , the diverging behavior of @xmath45 seriously hindered the determination of the hall resistance @xmath42 , as even a small hall - contact misalignment would result as the dominant contribution from @xmath45 . the traditional way to overcome",
    "this problem is by using the @xmath69 symmetry of the resistance components : r@xmath70 is expected to be symmetric when applying external b , while r@xmath71 to be anti - symmetric  @xcite .",

    "the transitions between plateaus take place at @xmath77 etc .",
    "a special case is the transition from the last hall plateau at @xmath78 that occurs at @xmath79 where the 2deg , instead of undergoing a transition between two plateaus , becomes an insulator . in the case of the pi transition in graphene from @xmath9",
    "to @xmath6 the expected filling factor at the transition is @xmath80 , almost the same that we have obtained in our experiment @xmath81 confirming our interpretation of this transition .    in this study of the pi transition we kept constant the carrier density ( constant gate potential )",

    "( [ scaling1 ] ) the experimental @xmath45 measured at four different temperatures we can obtain the associated critical exponent @xmath8:@xmath88 .    this approach has been used to study the plateau - insulator transition in a great variety of quasi 2d systems .",
    "the seminal magneto - transport experiments of tsui _",
    "et al_.  @xcite in ingaas / inp samples found a value for @xmath8 of @xmath89 in pp transitions .",
    "for a pi transition , although there remained some controversy , after two decades of experiments the most commonly measured value is @xmath90",
    ". this value has been found for a vast range of samples and materials , in agreement also with numerical simulations  @xcite    in fig .",
    "[ fitting ] we plot @xmath45 as a function of @xmath91 . we have not drawn possible maximum - minimum lines that can be extracted from upper and lower - bound values because it will reflect the strenght of the white noise , observed in magnetotransport experiments at very high magnetic fields ( see  @xcite as an example).we have fitted our data to the empirical law ( [ scaling1 ] ) with a typical least squares fit , and the goodness of single fit was testified by the fact that @xmath92 was about @xmath93 .",
    "we noted that the linear fit reproduces the behavior of the longitudinal resistance , and this indicates that the noise do not affect too much to the least squares accuracy . from these fits we obtained @xmath94",
    "that are plotted in the right inset of fig .",
    "[ fitting ] as a function of t. the exponent @xmath8 was then obtained from @xmath95 being the best fit @xmath10 ( with @xmath96 ) . to obtain the overall incertitude we introduced the error of each single fit and temperature stability ( @xmath97mk ) .",
    "we firmly believe that this is a clear evidence of the existence of a quantum hall insulator in graphene in the @xmath6 state away enough from the dirac point and that the transition from the last quantum hall liquid ( @xmath98 ) is the same ( i.e belongs to the same universality class ) as the well - known pi transition in conventional quasi 2d systems .",
    "previous experiments in the zero - energy state in graphene in the presence of high magnetic fields were focused on the dependence with the gate voltage  @xcite ( then for a fixed magnetic field ) and close to the dirac point . we observed that using magnetic field as the driving parameter rather than the gate voltage we can obtain a more reliable temperature independent critical point .",
    "in previous studies the @xmath6 quantum hall state does not show a clear plateau in @xmath42 , being only visible as a plateau in the hall conductance  @xcite .",
    "our measurements , although fluctuating , show a plateau in the hall resistance at @xmath6 . as we discuss above , the diverging behavior of the hall resistance for magnetic fields above @xmath99 ( see fig .",
    "[ conductivities ] ) is most likely due to hall - contact misalignment .",
    "unfortunately our cryostat allowed us a small range of temperatures that should be enlarged in future experiments . on the other hand , as it has been seen in previous experiments close to the dirac point , the measurements shown large fluctuations and the nature of this behavior",
    "is not clearly understood  @xcite .",
    "of course we checked our results and in particularly our fittings are stable and reproducible and that our main results are not affected by these fluctuations .",
    "checkelsky _ et al .",
    "_ reported temperature dependent transport measurements  @xcite where @xmath45 exhibits a magnetic field - induced crossover to a state with a very large resistance , as in our measurements .",
    "however , they observed that for a fixed magnetic field the resistance was almost temperature independent below @xmath100 .",
    "this behavior , which appears to exclude a pi transition , was interpreted in terms of the symmetry breaking effect of the disorder potential which may favor long - range order at _ finite _ temperature with a kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transition  @xcite . in their case ,",
    "the applied voltage was set extremely close to the dirac point or even on it while in our case was @xmath68v away from it ( note the big difference in terms of carrier density and mobility ) .",
    "they also observed how the divergence of @xmath45 was shifted to higher fields when the dirac point moved away from @xmath101v noting that it was important to choose samples with @xmath102v to investigate the intrinsic properties of the dirac point , that is not our scenario .",
    "we want to stress that our results are not in contradiction with the kt - like transition but rather probes a different regime .",
    "away from the dirac point , hence , when the magnetic field is varied in its strong regime ( above 10 t the zeeman splitting seems to be strong enough ) the fermi level is tuned through the first ( spin - resolved ) landau level . then the features reported in this work can be easily understood in term of a transition dominated by percolation of the extended state .",
    "the transition to an insulator reported in ref .",
    "@xcite occurs when the doping is set exactly at the dirac point .",
    "then , regardless of how strong b is ( as long as the spin is resolved ) , the fermi level in the bulk is always precisely in the middle of the zeeman gap . due to particle - hole symmetry , the filling factor as well @xmath2 and @xmath42 vanish to @xmath103 .",
    "in this situation , the only gapless states that can in principle give rise to non - trivial dissipative transport are the `` helical '' edge states discussed recently by shimshoni _",
    "et al_.  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we do not observe any trace of saturation over the range of temperatures investigated as in previous references  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we would like to stress that a temperature independent resistance has been observed in several experimental studies of pi quantum phase transitions .",
    "shahar et al .",
    "@xcite reported for the first time this type of behavior in a number of different 2d systems and although is not well understood it is usually related to some kind of long - range interactions  @xcite or to finite size effects  @xcite . in fact , finite size effects can be of particular relevance here due to the small size of graphene samples . also , the observed fluctuations in the measurements of @xmath45 and @xmath42 pointed out in our data could be at least partially related to mesoscopic effects  @xcite .",
    "we therefore conclude that our data shows clearly a pi transition from @xmath9 to @xmath6 most likely due to the presence of anderson localized states .",
    "we stress , however , that this do not exclude that such a kosterlitz - thouless transition could exist for higher magnetic fields or when the doping was precisely set at the dirac point being probable that both scenarios could coexist .",
    "summarizing , we have studied the quantum hall effect in graphene and in particular the @xmath9 to @xmath6 transition .",
    "we observed a pi transition when the magnetic field is tuned across a critical field @xmath66 t .",
    "both the hall conductivity and the hall resistance remain quantized deep into the insulating phase suggesting that we are in the quantized hall insulator regime , the same that was observed for the pi transition in low mobility 2d systems . using the standard scaling theory analysis we have obtained the critical exponent for this transition @xmath10 , in agreement with the common value observed for this exponent in conventional 2d systems .",
    "this evidences support the identification of @xmath6 in graphene as an insulating phase rather than a quantum hall state . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first measurement of this exponent in graphene and therefore the first measurement in a truly 2d system .",
    "therefore two distinct pi transitions exist near the dirac point in graphene , namely a conventional qh - insulator transition as the observed in our experiment and the recently observed kosterlitz - thouless transition by checkelsky",
    "_ et al_.  @xcite .",
    "further studies at lower temperatures and higher magnetic fields are needed to confirm our results in a larger range of temperatures and magnetic fields , and in particular to try to find the conditions where both transitions could be observed at the same time .",
    "we are grateful to j. m. cerver , f. domnguez - adame , e. shimshoni and n. azarova for the critical reading of the manuscript and for the enlighten suggestions , and to l. brey and f. guinea for useful discussions .",
