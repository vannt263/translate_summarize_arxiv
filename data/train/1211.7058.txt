    "in the cores of some galaxy clusters , the hot ( @xmath710@xmath8  k ) intracluster medium ( icm ) can reach high enough densities that the gas should cool by a combination of thermal bremsstrahlung and line cooling in less than a hubble time , leading to cooling flows on the order of 100 - 1000 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "much effort has been devoted to detecting these cooling flows at lower temperatures using a variety of methods .",
    "intermediate temperature gas has been detected in a number of clusters via spectroscopy in the x - ray @xcite , uv ( e.g. , ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , optical ( e.g. , h@xmath9 ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , even if this intermediate - temperature gas originated in the hot phase , the amount of it is orders of magnitude less than predicted by simple cooling flow models .",
    "similarly , the star formation rate in the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) , whether measured in the uv / optical @xcite or infrared @xcite , only accounts for a small fraction ( @xmath1110% ) of the predicted cooling flow . while there is some evidence that this intermediate - temperature gas and low - level star formation may represent a `` residual cooling flow '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the fact that the majority of the x - ray - inferred cooling is unaccounted for has served as prime evidence that some form of feedback is at work in cluster cores . the exact feedback mechanism that prevents the cooling catastrophe from happening is still",
    "not fully understood .",
    "the leading hypothesis of mechanical agn - driven feedback is supported by the correlation between the total energy required to offset cooling and the amount of radio power required to inflate x - ray cavities @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite reported the unique properties of a galaxy cluster at @xmath12 , spt - clj2344 - 4243 ( hereafter the phoenix cluster ) , which was initially discovered by the south pole telescope using the sunyaev zeldovich effect @xcite .",
    "this cluster is among the most massive ( m@xmath13 m@xmath3 ) , x - ray luminous ( l@xmath14 erg s@xmath4 ) , and strongest cooling ( m  @xmath6  3820  m@xmath3  yr@xmath4 ) clusters discovered to date .",
    "the central galaxy in the phoenix cluster appears to be experiencing a 740 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 starburst .",
    "however , it also harbors a powerful agn which makes it difficult to separate contributions to the ultraviolet , optical , and infrared emission from star - forming regions versus the agn in low - resolution imaging .",
    "further , the available ground - based data optical and space - based ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) data presented in @xcite were unable to distinguish between in situ star formation or the late stages of a merger .    in this letter",
    ", we present new _ hubble space telescope _",
    "observations which improve significantly in depth and spatial resolution on the data presented in @xcite . in ",
    "2 we describe our analysis of these data , after which we present our new , detailed view of the phoenix cluster in  3 . in ",
    "4 we discuss the possible interpretations of these data , including whether or not we can separate the cooling flow scenario from a pure agn or merger scenario .",
    "we conclude with a summary of these results in  5 . throughout this letter",
    "we assume h@xmath15  =  70 km  s@xmath4  mpc@xmath4 , @xmath16  =  0.27 , and @xmath17  =  0.73 .",
    "to study in detail the purported starburst in the core of the phoenix cluster , we obtained broadband imaging with the _ hubble space telescope _ _ wide field camera 3 _ ( hst wfc3 ) in five optical filters - f225w , f336w , f475w , f625w , f814w - which span rest - frame wavelengths from @xmath61000  to @xmath65500 .",
    "these observations were carried out over 2 orbits of director s discretionary time , with an average exposure time of @xmath61800s per filter ( pid # 13102 , pi mcdonald ) .    in each filter , a series of two dithered exposures were obtained .",
    "the la cosmic @xcite software was run on individual exposures , generating accurate cosmic ray and bad pixel masks for each image .",
    "pairs of exposures were then combined using the pyraf astrodrizzle routine , with the aforementioned masks preceding the standard cosmic ray detection in the multidrizzle task .",
    "the final , cleaned images are presented in figure [ fig:3x2 ] .",
    "all optical and uv fluxes were corrected for galactic extinction following @xcite using a galactic reddening estimate of @xmath18 towards the cluster center , from @xcite .",
    "in figure [ fig:3x2 ] we show the newly - acquired far - uv through optical hst images of the core of the phoenix cluster , which provide a detailed picture of this system .",
    "these images show significant , extended filamentary emission at all wavelengths from @xmath610005500 , overlaid on a relatively smooth population of older , red stars .",
    "the most extended pair of filaments to the north of the bcg are @xmath66@xmath19 ( 40  kpc ) in length , similar to the most extended filaments seen in abell  1795 @xcite , and the perseus cluster @xcite .",
    "we measure a total rest - frame far - uv flux density of f@xmath20 = 1.26@xmath2110@xmath22 erg s@xmath4 @xmath23 hz@xmath4 , consistent with the galex - derived flux presented in @xcite .",
    "the fact that such complex , filamentary morphology is present in all five filters suggests that the bcg is forming stars at a prodigious rate . in the wavelength range covered",
    ", there may be contributing emission from the @xmath241549 ( f225w ) , [ ] ( f625w ) , and [ ] and h@xmath25 ( f814w ) lines .",
    "however , the f336w and f475w bands , which have similar surface brightnesses to the other three bands , should be relatively free from emission lines , suggesting that young stars , not ionized gas , is the dominant source of the observed flux in figure [ fig:3x2 ] .    in figure",
    "[ fig : rgb ] we show a three - color ( f475w , f625w , f814w ) image of the cluster core .",
    "this figure shows a clear difference in the stellar populations between the young ( blue ) filaments and the underlying , smoothly - distributed , old ( red ) stars .",
    "the peak of the emission in all bands is coincident ( within the positional uncertainties ) with the x - ray point source . to the northwest and southeast of the emission peak",
    "are dark lanes , most likely due to obscuration by dust .",
    "overall , the color of the filamentary emission appears roughly constant with radius , and is reminiscent of a young , star - forming galaxy .",
    "we see no evidence for multiple bulges or tidal features , both of which would indicate that this system is the result of a recent merger of gas - rich galaxies .",
    "figure [ fig : sbprof ] shows the multi - band surface brightness profiles of the bcg ( left panel ) , which have been computed along radial cuts at four different angles ( 90@xmath26 , 120@xmath26 , 180@xmath26 , 210@xmath26 ) , chosen to avoid the blue , filamentary emission .",
    "the radial surface brightness profile follows an r@xmath1 profile , which is typical of relaxed , early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "such r@xmath1 surface brightness distributions are also common in the final stages ( single - nucleus ) of low - redshift ( @xmath27 ) gas - rich mergers ( ulirgs ; e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , with a half - light radius of @xmath617  kpc and a stellar mass of @xmath28  m@xmath3 @xcite , this bcg is a factor of @xmath64 larger in size @xcite , a factor of @xmath660 higher in stellar mass @xcite , and resides in an environment @xmath650100 times richer @xcite than normal for @xmath27 ulirgs .",
    "projecting these 1-dimensional profiles back onto the sky , we can separate diffuse , giant elliptical emission ( middle panel ) from clumpy , star - forming emission ( right panel ) .",
    "the lack of smooth , arcing tidal features and multiple bulges in the residual image ( right panel ) suggests that this complex , extended emission did not originate from a recent merger with one or more gas - rich disk galaxies .",
    "all of these factors argue that the phoenix bcg is unlike a traditional ulirg by any definition other than the high total infrared luminosity .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sed ] we provide the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) in several representative regions around the bcg .",
    "the diffuse emission at large and small radii indicate a significant positive age gradient in the diffuse population . at large ( r @xmath640  kpc ) radii , the diffuse emission is qualitatively consistent with a 25 gyr old elliptical galaxy , while at smaller radii ( @xmath620  kpc ) the diffuse stellar populations appear to be much younger ( bluer ) , similar in color to a star - forming spiral galaxy .",
    "the extended , morphologically - complex filaments , after subtraction of the diffuse stellar component , show an excess of uv emission at all radii .",
    "the sed of the brightest filaments appear remarkably similar to the diffuse component in the central region , suggesting that these stars are being mixed on short timescales . in the faintest , most extended filaments",
    ", there is a substantial excess of emission in the f225w and f625w filters , at the location of the redshifted @xmath241549 and [ ] lines , respectively , suggesting that these filaments may also contain warm ( @xmath29k ) , ionized gas  a scenario supported by the extended emission lines reported in @xcite .",
    "the overall flatness of the sed in the uv - bright regions is exactly what one would expect for a mix of young stars and warm , ionized gas , given the width of the broadband filters .",
    "at the peak of the optical emission , coincident with the x - ray source , the sed is qualitatively well matched by a dusty type-2 qso @xcite , which is consistent with our x - ray observations of a highly - reddened hard x - ray point source .",
    "the combination of figures [ fig:3x2][fig : sed ] paint a picture of an old , giant elliptical galaxy that is experiencing a resurgence of star formation .",
    "below we re - evaluate the sfr in this system and describe various scenarios to explain this star - forming activity , building on the discussion of @xcite .",
    "the deep , high spatial resolution hst uv and optical imaging presented in  3 have revealed an exceptionally complex system .",
    "below we utilize this improved spatial resolution to estimate a new , uv - derived sfr for the bcg in the phoenix cluster , followed by a discussion of three possible origins for the extended , filamentary uv emission .",
    "the sfr reported in @xcite , while utilizing an array of multi - wavelength data , necessarily required multiple assumptions to remove agn contamination . with the addition of high - resolution hst uv imaging ,",
    "we avoid such assumptions , leaving only the ( typical ) assumptions of dust extinctions and star formation laws .",
    "@xmath21 0.2@xmath19 bins overlaid in regions with @xmath30 detections in both the f336w and f475w bands . right : smoothed reddening map , derived assuming a flat uv sed in the absence of reddening @xcite .",
    "this map allows us to perform _ local _ reddening corrections on the uv images , yielding a more tightly constrained estimate of the extinction - corrected uv luminosity.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    to estimate the reddening , we assume that the reddening - free sed is flat at 15003000  @xcite .",
    "since the f225w filter may be contaminated by emission , we use the mean @xmath31 ( rest frame @xmath32 ) flux ratio to derive a reddening correction , assuming @xmath33 for e(b - v ) = 0 . in figure",
    "[ fig : ebv ] we show the spatial distribution of the reddening , e(b - v ) , over regions with significant ( @xmath34 ) uv flux .",
    "we note that the mean reddening in this map agrees well with the reddening presented in @xcite from balmer line ratios ( e(b - v ) = 0.34 ) . using the _ local _ reddening correction and uncertainty we can accurately correct the uv luminosity , resulting in a more confident estimate of l@xmath35 = 5.7 @xmath2 0.3 @xmath21 10@xmath36 erg s@xmath4 hz@xmath4 and a uv - derived sfr of 798 @xmath2 42 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "given the near - ir - estimated stellar mass of m@xmath37 m@xmath3 @xcite , this high sfr implies that in 100  myr the central galaxy in the phoenix cluster will form 23% of its stellar mass .",
    "we note that this estimate is consistent with the agn - subtracted sfr quoted in @xcite of 739 @xmath2 160 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 and with the empirical , extinction - implicit , method of @xcite , which yields sfr@xmath38 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 .        inspired by the high far - infrared luminosity , coupled with the hard x - ray and radio source , a viable explanation for this system is a dusty agn driving a large - scale outflow . while there is undoubtedly a powerful agn in the core of the phoenix cluster ,",
    "the new hst data suggest that the substantial uv luminosity can not be fully attributed to a point - like agn . only a small fraction ( @xmath3910% ) of the total uv luminosity originates from a central point source , with the majority originating from extended , filamentary regions .",
    "furthermore , the high relative fluxes in the f336w and f475w bands , which should be free from line emission , suggest that the majority of the uv / optical flux in these complex filaments is continuum emission .",
    "we also find a general lack of uv / blue emission along the minor axis of the central galaxy , contrary to what is typically observed in wide - angle agn - driven outflows @xcite .",
    "thus , we argue that the filamentary uv emission does not result from an outflow .    in iras",
    "09104 + 4109 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , along with other powerful radio galaxies , much of the extended uv continuum is due to scattered , polarized light from a heavily - obscurred qso .",
    "however , the uv continuum in iras  09104 + 4109 is @xmath620 times fainter than that presented here for the phoenix cluster @xcite .",
    "considering the fact that iras  09104 + 4109 is already an extreme system , it seems unlikely that this additional factor of 20 can be accounted for with the same model .",
    "the majority of known ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) appear to be late - stage mergers of gas - rich galaxies ( @xmath695% ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which begs the question : is the extreme star formation in the core of the phoenix cluster fueled by a gas - rich merger ? assuming a relation between molecular gas depletion time and specific star formation rate @xcite",
    ", we estimate an h@xmath10 depletion time of 212@xmath2110@xmath40  yr , which is consistent with those measured in two nearby cooling flows : a1068 ( 4@xmath41  yr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a1835 ( 5@xmath41  yr ; * ? ? ?",
    "assuming a 1-to-1 correspondence between the total mass of stars formed and the mass of the cold gas reservoir , this timescale implies a molecular gas mass of 1.59.5@xmath42 m@xmath3 , consistent with more recent work by @xcite , yielding 1.05.0@xmath42 m@xmath3 .",
    "this cold gas mass is significantly higher than that measured for gas - rich galaxies in the virgo cluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "further , the process of increasing the cold gas content by compressing atomic gas during a merger would be highly inefficient in the core of the phoenix cluster due to ram pressure stripping of the hi disk during the initial galaxy infall - a process observed in the virgo cluster , which has an icm density @xmath610 times lower than phoenix .",
    "our preferred explanation in @xcite was that the star formation in the cluster core is being fueled by gas cooling out of the icm .",
    "this remains the most plausible avenue for such a large amount of cold gas to reach the core of the cluster , and is supported by the exceptionally bright x - ray cool core and relatively weak radio source .",
    "such an imbalance between cooling and feedback could lead to rapid cooling of the icm , fueling bursts of star formation .",
    "following @xcite , we estimate from the x - ray data the mass deposition rate of the cooling flow , combining the x - ray cooling luminosity with the gravitational potential of the cluster in order to correct for gravitational work done as the gas falls towards the cluster center .",
    "we obtain an icm cooling rate of m  =  2700  @xmath2  700  m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 which is enough to fuel a 798 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 starburst , assuming the feedback mechanism that prevents star formation in nearby clusters is operating less efficiently in phoenix . in the future ,",
    "high resolution x - ray spectroscopy of the cool core ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will provide firm estimates of the icm cooling rate down to low temperatures , revealing whether or not this scenario is a plausible fuel source for this massive starburst .",
    "we report new hst observations of the phoenix cluster ( spt - clj2344 - 4243 ) with wfc3-uvis in five filters covering rest - frame wavelengths 1000 - 5500 .",
    "the high spatial resolution of hst is able to separate bright uv emission from the agn and the surrounding diffuse , extended emission , definitively confirming the presence of a starburst in the bcg .",
    "the morphology of this central galaxy is complex , with narrow filaments extending for @xmath040  kpc , reminiscent of the nearby perseus and abell  1795 clusters .",
    "we argue that the majority of the observed uv emission is due to young stars , on the basis of the complex morphology and flat sed over the wavelength range 10005500 .",
    "we confirm the high sfr presented in @xcite , measuring an extinction - corrected , agn - removed uv - derived sfr of 798 @xmath2 42 m@xmath43 yr@xmath4 .",
    "we find that merger driven scenarios would require an unreasonably large number of gas rich galaxies to supply the cold gas reservoir required to fuel the starburst , and conclude that the starburst is likely fueled by a massive cooling flow .",
