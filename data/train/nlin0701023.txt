    "recently , much attention has been devoted to the analysis of complexity arising in discrete physical systems living on networks with non - trivial topologies : remarkable examples are by now given by networks of nonlinear waveguides @xcite , bose - einstein condensates in optical lattices @xcite , josephson junction networks ( jjn ) @xcite and silicon - based photonic crystals @xcite . in these systems",
    ", the choice of the network s topology allows to engineer new macroscopically coherent quantum states : a remarkable example of macroscopic quantum coherence topologically induced by the network topology in jjn has been predicted in @xcite .",
    "another relevant area where one should be able to evidence new phenomena induced in discrete quantum systems by the topology is provided by nonlinear dynamical systems .",
    "nonlinearity already produces remarkable phenomena such as soliton propagation @xcite even in very simple geometries .",
    "a few steps in the study of the interplay between nonlinearity and complex topology have been made : recently , the effects of uniformity break on soliton propagation @xcite and localized modes @xcite have been investigated by considering @xmath0-junctions @xcite ( consisting of a long chain inserted on a site of a chain yielding a star - like geometry ) or geometries like junctions of two infinite waveguides or the waveguide coupler @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it has been considered the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation ( dnlse ) on a discrete network obtained by inserting a finite graph at a site of a one dimensional unbranched chain and the soliton propagation through this finite graph has been studied by numerical and analytical tools . it has been showed that for sufficiently large and fast solitons the soliton momenta for perfect reflection and transmission can be analytically related to the energy levels of the inserted graph .",
    "such results for the transmission properties of solitons in inhomogeneous networks have been used in @xcite to show that it is possible to engineer topological filters for the soliton motion on a complex chain .    the simple criterion relating the perfect reflection and transmission momenta and",
    "the energy levels of the inserted graph obtained in @xcite has been obtained in the situation in which the graph is inserted at a single site . in the present paper",
    "we address the more difficult issue of the soliton propagation for the dnlse on a network obtained by inserting a graph on _ two _ sites of an unbranched chain . in this respect",
    ", the inserted graph has an internal structure and it is seen by the soliton like an extended topological defect , since during the motion along the unbranched chain the soliton wavefunction is modified in more than one site .",
    "one therefore expects a variety of possible resonances between the energies characterizing the soliton propagation and the energy levels of the network .",
    "we shall focus here only on some particularly simple inserted graphs : loops , bubbles and single links attached in two sites ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following : after introducing in the next section the dnlse on a graph , we report in section iii our results for the transmission properties of solitons on such networks by resorting to numerical simulations and analytical results based on the linear approximation for the analysis of the interaction of fast solitons with these topological defects .",
    "section iv is devoted to our conclusions .",
    "the dnlse is a paradigmatic example of a nonlinear wave equation extensively studied on regular lattices @xcite . on a chain",
    "it reads @xmath1 where @xmath2 is an integer index denoting the site position and @xmath3 is the coefficient of the nonlinear term .",
    "the normalization condition is @xmath4 .",
    "it is well known that the dnlse on a homogeneous chain is not integrable ; however , soliton - like wave - packets can propagate with ( quasi)momentum @xmath5 for a long time @xcite . by means of a variational approach for gaussian wavepackets with width @xmath6 much larger than @xmath7",
    "( the distances are in units of the lattice length ) , one finds that , for @xmath8 , it is possible to have solitonic solutions of the variational equations of motion with constant width @xmath6 if @xmath9 and @xmath3 equals the critical value @xcite @xmath10 numerical simulations confirm that the stability of these wave packet is robust for long times .",
    "the generalization of eq.([dnls - retta ] ) on an arbitrary graph is @xmath11 in eq.([dnls - gen ] ) @xmath12 is the so - called adjacency matrix of the graph @xcite , which is defined to be @xmath7 if @xmath13 and @xmath14 are nearest - neighbours sites , and @xmath15 otherwise . we shall limit ourself to networks obtained inserting simple graphs at two sites of the unbranched chain ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the two sites of the unbranched chain at which the graph is inserted are defined to be @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we assume that the soliton is traveling from the left with constant velocity @xmath18 , related to @xmath5 by @xmath19 .",
    "eq.([dnls - gen ] ) is numerically solved with @xmath20 using as initial condition @xmath21 at the sites @xmath2 of the unbranched chain and @xmath22 at the sites of the added graph . in eq.([in - cond ] ) @xmath23 is a normalization factor and @xmath24 is the initial position of the soliton center : we choose @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 , so that @xmath28 and the soliton moves from the left to the right of the unbranched chain . from the numerical solution at very large times",
    "( well after the collision with the inserted graph ) the reflection and transmission coefficients @xmath29 and @xmath30 are computed by the relations @xmath31 and @xmath32 . in the following",
    "we shall present numerical results for the coefficients @xmath29 and @xmath30 obtained ( for an initial width @xmath33 ) for different values of @xmath5 and for the networks plotted in fig.1 .",
    "when the soliton is large ( @xmath34 ) and fast enough that the soliton - defect collision time is much shorter than the soliton dispersion time ( i.e. the time scale in which the wavepacket will spread in absence of interaction ) , thus one may resort to a linear approximation to compute the transmission coefficients @xcite since , in these limits , the soliton may be considered as a set of non interacting plane waves experiencing scattering on the graph .",
    "the soliton transmission coefficients may be then estimated by computing in the linear regime the transmission coefficients of a plane wave across this topological defect inserted at two sites .",
    "afterwords we shall compare our analytical findings with the results coming from the numerical solution of eq.([dnls - gen ] ) .",
    "let consider the situation in which a loop with length @xmath35 is inserted at the two neighbouring sites @xmath16 and @xmath36 of the unbranched chain [ see figs.1(a , b ) ] . in the linear approximation , which is expected to be reasonable when",
    "@xmath37 , the transmission coefficients may be determined by considering a plane wave solution having @xmath38 for @xmath39 , while for @xmath40 one puts @xmath41 at the sites @xmath42 of the loop the wavefunction is given by @xmath43 the eigenvalue equation to solve is @xmath44 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 run on all the sites of the whole network .",
    "of course , from eqs.([left])-([right ] ) one obtains @xmath45 . from the continuity in @xmath16 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and",
    "@xmath48 one gets , respectively @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 from eqs.([cont - loop1])-([cont - loop4 ] ) the reflection coefficient @xmath53 is given by : @xmath54 i.e. , @xmath55 , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 +   \\cos(4k)- 2\\cos(k(l-2 ) ) + \\cos(2kl ) - 3 \\cos(2k(l+1))+ \\cos(k(l+2))+2 \\cos(k(l+4))$ ] .",
    "of course , if one inserts a loop at a single site of the unbranched chain ( i.e. , @xmath17 ) , one has to require @xmath58 and eqs.([cont - loop3])-([cont - loop4 ] ) simply become @xmath59 .",
    "the results obtained for the reflection coefficient @xmath29 from the numerical solution of the dnlse ( [ dnls - gen ] ) and from the linear approximation , eq.([r - loop - l ] ) , are reported in fig.2 for @xmath60 ( circles ) and @xmath61 ( crosses ) and are in remarkable agreement .",
    "we see that for @xmath61 one has two values of the momenta for which there is perfect reflection ( @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) : this shows that one can control the soliton propagation by properly choosing the topology of the network .",
    "the average position @xmath64 is plotted vs. time in fig.3 .",
    "we see that before and after the collision the soliton move with constant velocity : with @xmath65 , one has @xmath66 before the collision , and @xmath67 after the collision which ( almost ) totally reflects the soliton .",
    "the splitting of the soliton in transmitted and reflected parts is illustrated in figs.4 - 5 , where we consider a loop with length @xmath60 and @xmath68 . in fig.4",
    "we plot @xmath69 at five different times , including a time ( @xmath70 ) in which the soliton hits the loop . in fig.5",
    "we plot the time evolution of the number @xmath71 of particles in the left ( @xmath72 ) , the number @xmath73 of particles in the right ( @xmath74 ) and the number @xmath75 of particles in the loop ( @xmath76 ) : one sees that for @xmath77 the number of particles in the loop increases and after the reflection decreases .    in the simplest case ( @xmath78 ) a single extra site",
    "is attached to the sites @xmath16 and @xmath36 of the unbranched chain , as in fig.1(a ) : then eq.([r - loop - l ] ) simplifies to @xmath79 the comparison between the results for @xmath29 from the numerical solution of the dnlse ( [ dnls - gen ] ) and from eq.([r - loop-1 ] ) is reported in fig.6 , showing also in this case a good agreement ,    we observe that the extra sites of the inserted graph can be view as external fano degrees of freedom coupled to the chain @xcite .",
    "in particular , in @xcite an additional discrete state is coupled to the sites of a straight linear chain : this would correspond in our description to a site linked to all the sites of the unbranched chain .",
    "we refer in this section to inserted @xmath80-bubble graphs , i.e. to loops with length @xmath78 inserted @xmath80-times at two sites of the unbranched chains which are distant @xmath81 [ see fig.1(c ) ] .",
    "to fix the notations the sites of the unbranched chain are defined to be @xmath82 , and other @xmath83 sites @xmath84 are linked to the sites @xmath85 and @xmath7 .",
    "of course , if @xmath86 , we have the simple chain .",
    "the coefficient @xmath29 may be obtained in the linear approximation in the following way : we assume @xmath87 for @xmath88 , @xmath89 for @xmath40 , and @xmath90 ( for symmetry , all the sites inside the bubble are equivalent ) . the eigenvalue equation ( [ eig ] ) , with @xmath45 , in the site",
    "@xmath85 reads @xmath91 , i.e. , @xmath92 similarly , eq.([eig ] ) in the site @xmath93 gives @xmath94 in a site inside the bubble , eq.([eig ] ) reads @xmath95 from eqs.([cont - bubble1])-([cont - bubble3 ] ) one gets @xmath96 of course , when @xmath86 , no reflection occurs .",
    "eq.([r - bubble ] ) shows that increasing @xmath5 from @xmath97 to @xmath98 ( i.e. , decreasing the velocity ) , the reflection increases : slower solitons are more reflected . in this meaning ,",
    "the @xmath80-bubble is an high - pass , i.e. only solitons with high velocity are transmitted : by varying @xmath80 one can control the width of the range of transmitted velocities . in fig.7 we plot the reflection coefficient @xmath29 for @xmath99 and @xmath100 , showing that a larger @xmath80 make smaller the range of transmitted velocities . as in figs.2 and 6 ,",
    "solid lines correspond to the analytical estimate [ given by eq.([r - bubble ] ) ] , and numerical results from the dnlse ( [ dnls - gen ] ) are expressed by circles ( @xmath99 ) and crosses ( @xmath100 ) .      in this section",
    "we consider the effect on the soliton propagation of two extra sites linked to two sites the unbranched chain , as in fig.1(d ) . to fix notations",
    ", we suppose that the two extra sites , @xmath101 and @xmath102 , are linked respectively to @xmath16 and @xmath103 .    to obtain the coefficient @xmath29 in the linear approximation , one proceeds as before",
    ": one assumes @xmath87 for @xmath39 , @xmath89 for @xmath104 , and @xmath105 for @xmath106 . the eigenvalue equation ( [ eig ] ) , with @xmath45 , in the sites @xmath15",
    ", @xmath35 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath7 and @xmath109 reads respectively @xmath110 @xmath111 @xmath112 @xmath113 @xmath114 @xmath115 one has seven unknowns ( @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 ) and the six equations ( [ cont - sep1])-([cont - sep6 ] ) ( the remaining is provided by the normalization ) .",
    "solving for @xmath123 one gets @xmath124 for @xmath78 eq.([r - sep - l ] ) simplifies to @xmath125 and for @xmath60 to @xmath126 notice that if you have only a site linked to a site of the unbranched chain , one obtains in the linear limit @xcite @xmath127 a comparison of eq.([r - single ] ) with eq.([r - sep - l ] ) shows the remarkable effect ( also for large @xmath35 ) of the second added link on the transmission properties . in fig.8 we plot the reflection coefficient @xmath29 for @xmath78 and @xmath60 , showing that in both situations one has a peak in the transmission ( @xmath128 ) for two different values : the two separate links behave approximately as transmission filters , i.e. , allowing for the transmission of solitons with certain velocities .",
    "increasing the distance @xmath35 between the sites at which the added sites are linked the number of such transmission peaks in turn increases . in fig.8",
    "the solid lines correspond to the analytical estimate [ given by eqs.([r - sep-1])-([r - sep-2 ] ) ] , and numerical results from the dnlse ( [ dnls - gen ] ) are expressed by circles ( @xmath78 ) and crosses ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "in this paper we studied the propagation of large - fast solitons on complex chains built by inserting finite graphs at two sites of an unbranched chain .",
    "the inserted graph is seen by the soliton like an extended topological defect : the transmission properties of the solitons strongly depend on the structure of the inserted graph .",
    "we considered simple inserted graphs : loops , bubbles and single links . for",
    "inserted loops peaks for perfect reflection occurs , while for bubbles the inserted graph behaves as a high - pass filter .",
    "when two added sites are linked to two sites having distance @xmath35 between them , transmission peaks appears and increasing the @xmath35 the number of such transmission peaks increases . in all these situations we compared numerical findings with the results of an analytical linear approximation , obtaining a good agreement .    in conclusion",
    "we think that the study of nonlinear dynamical systems on complex networks is a wide subject to investigate , and that the main motivation of such study is that the network topology provides a natural tool to control the nonlinear dynamics of wavepackets . in particular , we mention as possible interesting future studies the study of the propagation of very localized breathers on complex networks and the nonlinear trapping of solitonic solution in chains with topological defects ."
