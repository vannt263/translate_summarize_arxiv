    "recent studies by several authors using an effective 4-fermionic interaction between quarks  @xcite or direct instanton approach  @xcite have rekindled interest in the two flavor qcd phase transitions .",
    "in particular , alford , rajagopal and wilczek  @xcite have studied the pressure density and gap parameter using a fermionic lagrangian with an instanton motivated four - point interaction . at zero temperature",
    "these authors found negative pressure for a certain range of the fermi momentum , @xmath3 and showed the solutions of the gap equation as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "berges and rajagopal  @xcite extended this work and have calculated the phase diagram of a strongly interacting matter as a function of temperature and baryon number density in the same model .",
    "the question that we raise and examine in this paper is whether or not these results are fundamentally different from those obtained via the standard well - known nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model  @xcite , at least with regard to chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "quantities such as the gap parameter , pressure density and other thermodynamical quantities have been extensively studied in this model over the last decade  @xcite , and even to a level of sophistication that goes beyond the standard mean field treatments  @xcite .",
    "however , the results have usually been presented as a function of the chemical potential , and not as of the fermi momentum @xmath3 or density , as the authors of  @xcite have done , and hence the connection between their results and those of the njl model are not obvious .",
    "thus , in order to make a systematic comparison , we have to reevaluate the gap , pressure and phase diagram in these variables . in section",
    "ii we derive a simple analytical approximate expression for the phase boundary that is independent of the parameters of the njl model . in section iii",
    ", we examine the pressure as a function of the density and calculate the complete chiral phase diagram numerically from maxwell constructions .",
    "we compare our results with that of ref.@xcite . in section iv",
    ", we write down the form of the gap equation for a superconducting diquark transition , and thus the line of points in the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane .",
    "this is evaluated numerically .",
    "we summarize and conclude in section v.",
    "we commence by deriving an approximate analytic expression for the phase boundary curve .",
    "our starting point is the gap equation for the dynamically generated @xmath4 and @xmath5 quark mass @xmath6 that is derived from the su(2 ) chirally symmetric lagrangian , @xmath7\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath8 a dimensionful coupling and @xmath9 quark spinors for @xmath10 and @xmath11 quarks . at non - zero temperature and chemical potential , the mean - field self - energy or",

    "the condensate is related to @xmath6 via @xmath18 .",
    "the three momentum integrals are understood to be regulated by a cutoff @xmath19 , and a standard set of parameters , @xmath20gev and @xmath21 are used to fix the values of and the condensate density per flavor , @xmath22mev@xmath23 .",
    "let us examine first the @xmath24 limit of eq.([sigi ] ) .",
    "the gap equation for the non - trivial solution is @xmath25 in terms of the fermi momentum @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath3 is a decreasing function of the constituent mass taking its maximum value , @xmath26 at the chiral phase transition , @xmath27 @xmath28 using the numerical values of @xmath8 and @xmath19 given above and fixing @xmath29 , @xmath30 leads to the numerical value @xmath31 .",
    "we use this relation to eliminate @xmath32 in favor of @xmath33 .",
    "now , in order to determine the phase transition line , we start with the gap equation  ( [ sigi ] ) and divide @xmath34 out . the critical values of the temperature and chemical potential that lie on the phase transition boundary are determined through the vanishing chiral condensate and hence @xmath35 . performing the usual substitution @xmath36 as appropriate , and evaluating the integral on the right hand side",
    ", one finds @xmath37 this equation defines the chiral phase transition curve in the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane , and in this form contains no explicit model dependence on @xmath8 and @xmath19 .",
    "we would however , prefer to display the phase transition line as a function of temperature and quark density .",
    "to do so , we express the density through the fermi momentum , @xmath3 at zero temperature , @xmath38 at finite temperature , the quark density @xmath39 is given as @xmath40 \\ , .",

    "one can take a set of @xmath0 and @xmath1 and calculate for example @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the result obtained can be seen in fig .",
    "1 where for fixed @xmath0 , @xmath24 the mass @xmath6 is plotted as a function of @xmath3 ( solid line ) and of @xmath1 ( dashed line ) for comparison .",
    "we note that the behavior found is qualitatively the same as that in  @xcite . at the chiral phase transition point , @xmath35 and @xmath47 with @xmath48",
    "this expression can be used to eliminate @xmath1 from eq .",
    "( [ phasemu ] ) and the chiral phase transition curve in the @xmath0-@xmath41 plane is determined from the simple analytical expression , @xmath49    the solution of this third order equation in @xmath50 , defining the critical temperature , @xmath51 at which the phase transition occurs for a given ratio @xmath52 can be written as @xmath53 with @xmath54 ^{-2}-1 }   & \\rho\\leq 1\\\\ \\pi+{\\rm tan}^{-1}\\sqrt{\\left[\\rho^2 - 1\\right ] ^{-2}-1 }   \\hspace*{10 mm } & 1\\leq\\rho\\leq 2^{1/6}\\end{array}\\right . .\\ ] ] the trivial solution to the gap equation is the only solution if the temperature exceeds the maximum value of the critical temperature on the transition curve , @xmath55 or if @xmath56 .",

    "we return now to the thermodynamical quantities . from eq.([omega ] ) for @xmath61 , it follows that the pressure density is given as @xmath62 + \\gamma\\int\\!\\frac{{\\rm d}^3p}{(2\\pi)^3}e_p-\\frac{m^2}{4g}\\,.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath63 the energy density is found to be @xmath64 -\\gamma\\int\\!\\frac{{\\rm d}^3p}{(2\\pi)^3}e_p+\\frac{m^2}{4 g } \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the limit @xmath65 , one has @xmath66 where @xmath67 while an analogous calculation for the pressure density @xmath68 at @xmath69 , @xmath70 yields @xmath71 @xmath72 and @xmath73 are independent of temperature and chemical potential and their value is ( up to the sign ) the same . for our choice of parameters , @xmath74 . measuring the pressure and energy densities relative to their vacuum values",
    ", we have @xmath75 in fig .",
    "3 , we plot the pressure density as a function of @xmath41 for a range of temperatures . note that at @xmath24 , @xmath68 becomes _ negative _ and displays a cusp like structure .",
    "this is bought about by the fact that the two solutions for the gap equation enter into the pressure density on the different arms of the pressure : the rising curve is bought about by the @xmath76 solution , while the solution that goes down has a value of @xmath77 . note that this situation is similar to that observed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the phase transition curve can now be calculated using a more standard but numerical treatment and compared to the approximate ( second order ) curve shown as the dashed line in fig .  2 .",
    "the difference between these two curves lies in the fact that the analytic one is calculated with @xmath78 , while the numerical curve has @xmath19 finite .",
    "it is worth noting that the truncation of the njl model to zero modes  @xcite shows a similar behavior to the one observed in the full model , however , lacking the unstable backbending of the phase curve at high temperatures . plotting the pressure rather as a function of volume allows one to perform maxwell constructions and obtain the full information of the phase diagram , including the metastable region .",
    "the results of this calculation are show in fig .  4 as a function of @xmath79 as the solid curves .",
    "also shown ( dashed curves ) are the calculations of ref .",
    "we note that the phase transition curve for the chiral transition are qualitatively identical .",
    "the main difference between these curves lies in the observation that the mixed phase given by ref .",
    "@xcite starts already at @xmath80 , similarly to the truncated njl calculation  @xcite .",
    "the equivalence of these models is perhaps not simply apparent when one examines the lagrangians .",
    "however , the thermodynamical potential of ref .",
    "@xcite is precisely that of eq .",
    "( [ omega ] ) in the absence of the diquark condensate .",
    "thus the differences observed in fig .",
    "4 can only be attributed to the use of slightly different parameters , plus the different method of implementing regularization - in the njl model here , a ` hard ' cutoff @xmath19 is employed , and in the approximate expression for the phase curve , is also taken as @xmath81 , while the authors of @xcite use a soft form factor @xmath82 to regulate their momentum integrals .",
    "the physics however can not and does not depend on this and the qualitative results remain unchanged .",
    "limitations and difficulties of this model in describing thermodynamical quantities are well - known  @xcite .",
    "we illustrate one problem in showing the energy per quark plotted at @xmath24 as a function of the density in fig .  5 .",
    "this quantity does not posses a minimum at normal nuclear matter density as expected , in apposition to recent linear sigma model calculations  @xcite",
    "the thermodynamic potential for three colors @xmath61 given in eq.([omega ] ) corresponds precisely to the @xmath83 limit of the function @xmath84 @xcite @xmath85 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\sqrt{\\xi_+^2+\\delta^2 } + s\\sqrt{\\xi_-^2+\\delta^2 } + 2t\\ln(1+e^{-\\beta\\sqrt { \\xi_+^2+\\delta^2}})(1 + e^{-\\beta s\\sqrt { \\xi_-^2+\\delta^2 } } ) \\big\\ } , \\label{e : omextend}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath86 , and @xmath87 is the color superconducting condensate in the diquark channel .",
    "@xmath88 is a sign function , and @xmath89 for @xmath90 or @xmath91 . here",
    "the expression from @xcite has been modified to remove the form factor ",
    "instead a 3-d cutoff @xmath92 as is usual in the njl model and which was used in the previous section is to be understood .",
    "@xmath93 is a new coupling strength mediating a four - fermion interaction that is attractive in the diquark channel .",
    "the form for @xmath94 from eq.([omega ] ) thus indicates that the models are the same , and the same gap equation for the chiral transition is retained . for the superconducting sector , the gap obtained by differentiating @xmath95 with respect to @xmath87 is @xmath96 this expression is a relativistic generalization of the superconducting gap equation for electron pairs @xcite in which the quasiparticle energies @xmath97 and @xmath98 relative to the fermi surface are introduced . note that at @xmath24 , one recovers the result of @xcite for @xmath99 , assuming that the form factor of these authors is set to one . the phase transition line in the @xmath0-@xmath1 or @xmath0-@xmath41 planes",
    "can now be obtained quite simply .",
    "assuming that the superconducting phase transition can only occur in the region where chiral symmetry is restored , we may set @xmath100 .",
    "furthermore we assume the transition to be second order , driven by the condition @xmath101 .",
    "thus the @xmath0-@xmath1 critical curve satisfies @xmath102",
    "which , with obvious changes of variables reduces to @xmath103 unlike the case for electron pairing , in which @xmath104 , with @xmath105 the debye frequency , we can not regard the logarithmic term as being leading , and it is not possible to obtain a simple analytic expression for the right hand side of eq.([e : tosolve ] ) .",
    "we thus solve eq.([e : tosolve ] ) numerically for the critical line .",
    "clearly this depends on the choice of the strength @xmath93 and is a sensitive function thereof . arbitrarily demanding that @xmath106mev at @xmath107gev close to the values of ref .",
    "@xcite sets @xmath108 gev@xmath109 , or @xmath110 .",
    "the resulting curve is indicated by the dotted line in fig .",
    "4 . as can be seen , the qualitative behavior of the model of ref.@xcite is confirmed .",
    "we found a somewhat lower gap , @xmath87 being @xmath111 at the chiral transition point and zero temperature increasing up to @xmath112 at and @xmath113 and zero temperature .",
    "the general behavior of the gap parameter as a function of the chemical potential and temperature is given in fig .",
    "finally , we comment that although the diquark phase transition line was investigated here under the expectation that chiral symmetry is restored , this is not necessarily the case : in principle , the diquark phase transition line can extend into the region in which chiral symmetry is broken , i.e. where @xmath114 or @xmath34 . in practice",
    ", this turns out to be a function of the parameters chosen .",
    "if the diquark phase transition line enters into the region of chiral symmetry breaking at a temperature larger than the tricritical temperature , the dependence of @xmath45 that enters into eq.(23 ) is continuous , and a solution to this equation can be found . for our choice of @xmath93 , however , the diquark transition line would enter into the region where a first order phase transition takes place .",
    "thus @xmath45 is discontinous , and no physically accessible solution to this equation can be found .",
    "the situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "7 , in which eq.(23 ) is inverted and solved for @xmath93 and the functional dependence , as well as the numerical parameter value @xmath115 gev@xmath109 are plotted as a function of temperature for several values of @xmath1 .",
    "one sees from this figure that the line @xmath116gev@xmath109 can not intersect the curve @xmath117gev for example , which lies in the broken phase , and therefore there is no physically attainable solution .",
    "note however that by adjusting the value of the constant @xmath93 to a somewhat smaller value could admit a solution within this region .",
    "in analyzing the chiral phase transition in the njl model at finite temperature and density , we find the same behavior for the chiral and diquark phases as that reported in @xcite and @xcite , which use an instanton motivated interaction that is also four point in nature .",
    "that this must occur can be seen directly from the explicit form of the thermodynamical potential that is well - known in our case @xcite , and which is obtained from @xcite on setting the form factor to one and introducing a 3-d cutoff @xmath19 . in addition , we are easily able to give an approximate analytic form for the chiral phase curve in the @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath0-@xmath41 planes that is independent of the model parameters . we have examined the extended form of the thermodynamic potential that makes provision for a diquark condensate and obtained the appropriate critical line in the njl model .",
    "our qualitative results conform with those of @xcite .",
    "in addition , we find evidence for the appearance of a diquark condensate also within the region where chiral symmetry is not restored , but this is strongly parameter dependent .",
