    "current observational estimates of the ultraviolet ( uv ) luminosity density at redshifts @xmath10 ( for a comprehensive discussion see , e.g. , @xcite ) , on the other hand , may imply star formation rate ( sfr ) densities several times lower than the critical sfr density required to keep the intergalactic medium ( igm ) ionised .    the critical sfr density , @xmath11 originally derived by @xcite and here rescaled to match the most recent wmap estimate for the cosmic baryon density ( @xcite ) , is inversely proportional to the escape fraction @xmath12 , i.e. the fraction of ionising photons produced by star - forming galaxies that escape the interstellar medium ( ism ) to ionise the igm .",

    "most observational studies that compare the sfr density derived from estimates of the uv luminosity density at redshift @xmath6 to the critical sfr density assume an escape fraction @xmath15 and a clumping factor @xmath16 .",

    "our main motivation for computing the clumping factor of the igm is to evaluate the critical sfr density required to keep the igm ionised .",
    "the critical sfr density describes a balance between the number of ionising photons escaping into the igm ( parametrised by @xmath34 ) and the number of ionising photons that are removed from the igm due to photoionisations of recombining hydrogen ions ( parametrised by @xmath35 ) .",
