    "lattice results for the equation of state ( eos ) have long been used to model the hydrodynamic evolution of the thermal matter that is created in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "although state - of - the - art results exist for the eos at @xmath3  @xcite , with the advent of the beam energy scan ( bes ) experiment at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , it has become necessary to extend these results to moderately large values of the baryon chemical potential @xmath1 .",
    "specifically , values @xmath4 400 - 450 mev are expected to be reached at the lowest center - of - mass energies  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the well - known sign problem in lattice qcd prevents a straightforward extension of the usual techniques used to calculate the eos at @xmath3 to the region @xmath5  @xcite . while a complete solution to the sign problem is not yet known , various methods have been suggested to partially overcome it . among these , the method of taylor expansions is the most straightforward  @xcite .",
    "the method has the advantage that the only error ( apart from the usual statistical error ) is the one coming from the truncation of the taylor series .",
    "moreover , the various coefficients of the expansion bear a straightforward interpretation as either the cumulants of the various conserved charge distributions ( diagonals ) , or as the correlations between them ( off - diagonals ) .",
    "because of this , they can be used to probe deconfinement  @xcite and they can also be measured in experiments via the moments of different hadron multiplicity distributions  @xcite .    the basic thermodynamic quantity is the pressure @xmath6 , which at @xmath5 may be written as @xmath7    with three flavors of quarks , one has three chemical potentials .",
    "a change of basis allows us to express these in terms of conserved charge chemical potentials : baryon number , electric charge and strangeness : @xmath8 .",
    ".   is a completely general expression .",

    "by contrast , the baryon number density receives its leading contribution from @xmath26 susceptibilities and its first corrections from the @xmath0 ones .",
    "this makes it a good observable to study the impact of higher - order corrections .",
    "[ fig : freezeout ] ( left ) plots the baryon number density , in units of @xmath37 , on the freezeout curve as a function of the beam energy .",
    "we see that the leading - order description is a good one down to @xmath38 gev , at which point the leading and next - to - leading order results start to differ .",
    "going to still lower energies , we find that similarly , the @xmath32 and @xmath33 terms seem to start to differ below @xmath39 gev .",
    "a second way in which higher - order corrections might be important is seen from the energy density plot in the same figure .",
    "freeze - out is believed to happen when the energy density drops to a certain , constant value .",
    "we can check this hypothesis by calculating the energy density on the freeze - out curve .",
    "the zeroth - order result , which only takes the temperature dependence into account , remains roughly constant down to @xmath40 gev , below which it seems to dip .",
    "when @xmath26 and @xmath0 terms are included , the constant region is extended to slightly lower energies @xmath38 gev , although the current errors preclude a more quantitative statement .",
    "better statistics should certainly clarify the issue .",
    "however , it may be worth pointing out that the constant value of the energy density , @xmath41 gev/@xmath42 , is very close to the value in the crossover region and at the `` softest point '' of the @xmath3 eos ( ref .",
    "the qcd equation of state is a necessary input in hydrodynamic models of heavy - ion collisions , and calculating it from first principles has been one of the major programs in lattice qcd . with experiments to probe nuclear matter at finite density either running ( bes ) or planned ( bes - ii and fair ) , the interest has shifted to equations of state at @xmath5 . in this work ,",
    "we presented first results from an ongoing calculation by the bnl - bielefeld - ccnu collaboration to calculate the eos to fourth order in the baryon chemical potential .",
    "we expect that this will eventually yield an equation of state that is valid down to beam energies of @xmath43 gev and lower .",
