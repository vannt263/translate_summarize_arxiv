    "one of the challenging goals of neutrino experiments is the detection of cp violation in the neutrino sector .",
    "a convincing evidence would be the detection of an asymmetry between the oscillation rates of muon neutrinos and antineutrinos into electron neutrinos since , in the absence of cp violation , these rates are the same . for this test one",
    "needs a muonic neutrino beam and an antineutrino one .",
    "the electrons ( positrons ) produced in a far detector by the charged current interaction of the electron neutrinos ( antineutrinos ) are the signature for the @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) oscillation process , once the direct @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) background is eliminated .",
    "several obstacles can stand on the way of the detection of cp violation through the @xmath6 , @xmath7 asymmetry .",
    "one is that the interactions of neutrinos and antineutrinos with any nucleus are not identical but they differ by the sign of the axial vector interference term , creating an asymmetry unrelated to cp violation and which has to be fully mastered .",
    "this is not a trivial task due to the complexity of the nuclear dynamics .",
    "it reflects in the neutrino interactions and may obscure the message that one wants to extract on the oscillation mechanism .",
    "one example concerns the role of the multinucleon emission process which in a cherenkov detector is misidentified for a quasielastic one @xcite .",
    "this misinterpretation produces an apparent increase of the neutrino quasielastic cross section , at the origin of the so called axial mass anomaly detected in the miniboone experiments @xcite as now widely accepted @xcite .",
    "the detection of cp violation which involves a comparison between neutrinos and antineutrinos events needs an even more detailed understanding of the multinucleon processes since it concerns the difference between neutrino and antineutrino cross sections .",
    "this is not a priori obvious and it is the object of the present article .",
    "in order to illustrate the respective roles of the multinucleon components in the @xmath6 and @xmath8 cross sections , as we have introduced in a previous work @xcite , we start by giving below the following simplified expression ( we remind however that for the actual evaluation we use a more complete one ) for the double differential neutrino or antineutrino cross sections on a nuclear target such as @xmath9c @xmath10,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the plus ( minus ) sign applies to neutrinos ( antineutrinos ) . in this eq .",
    "( [ eq1:cross_section ] ) @xmath11 is the weak coupling constant , @xmath12 the cabibbo angle , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the nucleon electric , magnetic and axial form factors , @xmath16 and @xmath17 the initial and final lepton energies , @xmath18 the modulus of the final lepton momentum , @xmath19 and @xmath20 the energy and the momentum transferred to the nucleus and @xmath21 is the lepton scattering angle .",
    "the cross section on the nuclear target is expressed here in terms of the nuclear responses @xmath22 to probes with various couplings to the nucleon , isovector ( index @xmath23 ) or isovector with isospin and spin coupling ( index @xmath24 ) .",
    "for the last responses the isovector spin coupling can be spin transverse , @xmath25 , or spin longitudinal , @xmath26 .",
    "the responses are @xmath20 and @xmath19 dependent .",
    "the last term of eq .",
    "( [ eq1:cross_section ] ) which changes sign between @xmath6 and @xmath8 is the axial vector interference term , the basic asymmetry which follows from the weak interaction theory .",
    "it is expressed here in terms of isospin spin - transverse nuclear response .",
    "its evaluation for complex nuclei is not trivial due to the presence of many - body effects .",
    "this is why it is important to obtain an experimental information on this term , one object of the present work .",
    "now , for our description of the multinucleon component of the responses , we followed the experimental indications provided by the electron scattering data . in the transverse , or magnetic , data the dip between the quasielastic and the delta part of the response is filled , which we interpreted as an indication for the presence of two nucleon emission @xcite . in the charge response instead this component is absent . with these indications , for neutrinos we have introduced the multinucleon component only in the spin isospin response , the pure isovector one keeping its quasielastic character .",
    "this difference is at the origin of the statement in our work of ref .",
    "@xcite that the multinucleon effect should be relatively less pronounced for antineutrinos than for neutrinos , the reason being that the isovector response which is free from multinucleon effect plays a larger relative role for antineutrinos due to the negative sign of the interference term .",
    "this argument obviously holds only in the kinematical regions where the influence of the isovector component is significant .",
    "we have previously tested our model on the miniboone data for the differential cross sections @xcite , independently for neutrinos @xcite and antineutrinos @xcite .",
    "the good fit of the data provided by our model did not contradict our statement on the respective roles of np - nh .",
    "however in these works , the test was performed separately for the neutrinos and the antineutrinos and we did not specifically address the detailed comparison between the two . as this comparison is essential for the cp violation detection",
    "we want to investigate in the present work this question in more details . for cherenkov detectors , such as the miniboone or the super - kamiokande ones ,",
    "are we able to describe quantitatively the difference between neutrinos and antineutrinos nuclear interactions ?",
    "the wealth of experimental data which has accumulated in the last years by the miniboone experiment allows an experimental test for this comparison and we will explore the message which can be drawn from these data . the quantity best suited for this exploration is the measured double differential quasielastic - like ( _ i.e. _ which incorporates also multinucleon states ) cross section @xmath27 with respect to the muon energy @xmath28 and the muon emission angle @xmath21 , which is not affected by the reconstruction problem of the neutrino energy @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "however it is flux dependent , with @xmath29 where @xmath19 is the energy transferred to the nucleus and @xmath30 is the neutrino ( or antineutrino ) normalized flux .",
    "neutrino experiments measure @xmath27 while nuclear physics evaluations calculate the quantity @xmath31 , which is the basic ingredient for all analysis on neutrino data .",
    "the flux dependence in @xmath27 is a priori an obstacle to extract a universal comparison between the two cross sections for neutrinos and antineutrinos , applicable to cp violation experiments . for each set of flux profiles the measured differential cross sections are different . in particular",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath8 asymmetry for @xmath27 has two sources , one arises from the basic weak interaction theory , as given in eq .",
    "( [ eq1:cross_section ] ) .",
    "the second one which arises from the flux asymmetry has no universal character and is specific for each experiment .",
    "is there nevertheless something general and informative in the miniboone data ? it is the question that we will address in the following .",
    "let us consider the following combinations : the sum , @xmath32 , and the difference , @xmath33 , of the double differential cross sections for neutrinos and antineutrinos with respect to the lepton emission angle , @xmath21 , and to the energy @xmath19 transferred to the nucleus @xmath34 while for the difference @xmath33 the sign plus is changed to a minus one .",
    "notice from eq .",
    "( [ eq1:cross_section ] ) that the difference , @xmath33 , contains only one term , the axial vector interference one .",
    "it is this quantity which governs the difference in cross sections of @xmath35 and @xmath36 but it is not accessible directly from neutrino data since only derivatives with respect to the emitted lepton energy are measurable .",
    "we also introduce @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the corresponding flux integrated quantities , which are instead experimentally accessible in the miniboone data , @xmath39 @xmath40 in which quantities such as @xmath41 have been defined previously in eq .",
    "( [ eq2:sigma _ flux_folded ] ) .",
    "the miniboone experimental distribution of @xmath42 has been given by grange and katori @xcite in a tridimensional plot .     and",
    "@xmath43 fluxes derived from refs . @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "their half sum ( @xmath44 ) and half difference ( @xmath45 ) are also shown.,width=453,height=302 ]    if the normalized neutrino and antineutrino flux profiles would be identical , @xmath46 , their common value could be factorized in the integrals over the neutrino energies implicitly contained in the above eqs .",
    "( [ eq4:s ] ) and ( [ eq5:d ] ) . in this case",
    "only the axial vector interference term would survive in the difference @xmath38 , while the sum @xmath37 would totally eliminate this term .",
    "this would allow a direct experimental test of the interference part .",
    "however this is not quite the case as appears in fig .",
    "[ fig_fluxes ] which compares the two normalized miniboone fluxes . in view of this difference",

    "we have evaluated the sum @xmath37 and the difference @xmath38 with the real miniboone fluxes on the one hand and with only the mean flux @xmath56 on the other hand .",
    "these evaluations are performed with our theoretical model which has been described for instance in refs .",

    "they progressively depart .",
    "the fact that the mean flux curve is below the genuine flux one reflects the positive sign of @xmath52 for large @xmath53 values ( large @xmath59 values meaning also large @xmath53 values ) .",
    "notice also that for the smallest @xmath59 values , for which the neutrino energy can be small , one can detect a change in the sign of the effect , which becomes slightly negative , reflecting the sign change of @xmath60 . in spite of the ( moderate ) deviations at large muon kinetic energies , for all @xmath61 values",
    "the contribution from the mean flux remains dominant in the difference @xmath38 .",
    "this is fortunate since it means that the axial vector interference term is experimentally accessible in the miniboone data through the neutrino and antineutrino double differential cross sections difference .",
    "we can in particular test if our multinucleon component , which in our model is maximum in the axial vector interference term , i.e. , in the difference @xmath38 , is compatible , or not , with the data . while with the sum of the neutrino antineutrino cross sections instead we can explore its role in the remaining part of the cross section . in general",
    "when the @xmath6 and @xmath8 normalized flux difference is small the same conclusion applies : the difference in the measurable differential cross sections between neutrinos and antineutrinos is dominated by the axial - vector interference term .",

    "this test of the validity of our model for these combinations is important as it addresses directly to the question of our understanding of the neutrinos versus antineutrinos interactions , in particular for what concerns the crucial and more debated role of the multinucleon component .",
    "our predicted cross sections without the multinucleon part are also shown in figs .",

    "[ fig_dif_d ] .",
    "another check remains to be performed to fully confirm the necessity of the multinucleon piece , in particular in the axial vector interference term : in our description the collectivity of the quasielastic responses has been included in the form of the random phase approximation treatment , rpa .",
    "it produces a suppression effect of the quasielastic part due to the repulsive character of the particle - hole force @xcite . for the spin - isospin transverse response",
    "it is the ericson - ericson  lorentz - lorenz quenching arising from the mixture of delta - hole states into nucleon - hole ones @xcite .",
    "the question is then : if a good fit is obtained with the combined and opposite effects of rpa and of the multinucleon component , could it be that a similar good fit would be achieved by omitting both effects",
    ". would the simplest quasielastic description also account for the data ? in figs .",
    "[ fig_sum_s ] and [ fig_dif_d ] the effect of rpa is suppressed in the quasielastic cross section , which indeed has some enhancement effect . in particular for the cross section difference",
    "this enhancement is moderate and not enough to account by itself , for the data .",
    "we can safely conclude that a large multinucleon component is needed to describe the data for the axial vector interference term which governs the cross sections difference .",
    "the same conclusion applies to the cross sections sum , i.e. to the remaining part of the interaction , it is also appreciably influenced by the multinucleon component .",
    "our model for the neutrino nucleus interaction is able to describe both components . as an additional illustration of its success we report in fig .",
    "[ fig_ds_cos_tmu__sd ] the single differential cross sections , with respect to the muon kinetic energy or to the muon emission angle .",
    "as previously we deal with the sum and the difference for neutrinos and antineutrinos calculated with the true and the averages fluxes .",
    "we can observe again that the sum shows practically no sensitivity to the flux difference , while the cross sections difference displays some a mild sensitivity , in particular in the forward direction or at large @xmath61 values .",
    "our predictions which include the multinucleon component reproduce well the data . in our model",
    "the relative importance of the multinucleon term in the cross sections combinations depends on the role of the isovector response which is shown in fig . [ fig_ds_cos_tmu__sd ] , the smaller this role the larger the multinucleon contribution .",
    "it is the largest in the cross section difference .",
    "similarly the isovector response weight is larger in antineutrino cross sections than in neutrino ones , hence the smaller multinucleon contribution for antineutrinos .",

    "as previously pointed out the difference is more sensitive to the mean flux approximation which however gives the bulk of this difference . as a consequence",
    "the difference of the experimental miniboone points @xmath67 is directly related to the @xmath66 distribution of the axial vector interference term .",
    "this conclusion would apply as well to the miner@xmath6a neutrino @xcite and antineutrino @xcite @xmath66 distributions , due to the closeness of the neutrino and antineutrino normalized fluxes",

    "notice that the present study is done for the muonic neutrinos of the miniboone experiment , for which data are available while cp violating experiments through the asymmetry of the oscillations rates of muonic neutrinos and antineutrinos into electron ones involve the detection of electrons or positrons produced in a detector by the charged current interactions of these electron neutrinos .",
    "we have already addressed the question of electron neutrino cross sections , versus the muon neutrino ones @xcite .",
    "the effect of the small change in kinematics due to the smaller electron mass will not affect the present conclusions : the electron neutrino nuclear interactions produce by themselves an important @xmath4 @xmath68 asymmetry .",
    "the present study indicates that the multinucleon role is essential in this problem and to what precision this asymmetry can be mastered .",
    "in summary we have investigated two different combinations of the neutrino and antineutrino miniboone flux folded double differential cross sections on @xmath9c , their sum and their difference .",
    "they probe different pieces of the neutrino or antineutrino interactions with the nucleus .",
    "these quantities depend on the neutrino or antineutrino flux . in the case of identical neutrino and antineutrino normalized flux profiles ,",
    "the difference provides a direct access to the axial vector interference term , while the sum totally eliminates it . as this is not actually the case for the miniboone fluxes we have tested how much the flux difference influences the two combinations .",
    "we have shown that this influence is small both on the sum and on the difference of the cross sections .",
    "these combinations remain rather pure with respect to the axial vector interference term which is either dominant ( difference ) or nearly absent ( sum ) .",
    "this allows more specific tests of our theoretical model on the axial vector interference term , important for the cp violation data .",
    "our model gives a good fit for the miniboone data for the sum and the difference of the cross sections reproducing well the data in the full range of muon energy and emission angle .",
    "the introduction of the multinucleon component is necessary for a good fit , an important test for its presence in the axial vector interference term .",
    "the success of our description indicates that we can reach a good understanding of the nuclear effects in neutrino interactions , also for what concerns the comparison between neutrinos and antineutrinos cross sections .",
    "we have concentrated in this work on the interactions of muonic neutrinos where a complete set of data is available .",
    "our predictions can easily be extended to electron neutrinos , relevant for cp violation data .",
    "the nuclear cross section difference for neutrinos and antineutrinos stands as a potential obstacle in the interpretation of experiments aimed at the measurement of the cp violation angle , @xmath69 .",
