    "while the average number is larger for fainter thresholds , dependence of the average number on the distance from the galactic center is similar .",
    "the average number decreases with the distance because the distant subhalos were recently formed and do not satisfy the criteria of pop iiistar formation ( sec .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to the large average number of pop iii  survivors in nearby dwarf galaxies , the faint threshold can be realized for nearby dwarf galaxies .",
    "thus , the all sky survey of nearby dwarf galaxies is highly demanded for the detection of pop iiisurvivors .",
    "the increasing number of nearby dwarf galaxies refines the constraint on @xmath76 .",
    "in contrast to the pop iii  survivors in the milky way , the survivors in dwarf galaxies are as faint as @xmath71 and the numbers of the detectable pop iii  survivors and dwarf galaxies strongly depend on the limiting magnitude .",
    "therefore , the light collecting power is essential on the detection of survivors in dwarf galaxies .",
    "although the number of stars that are bright enough for the high - dispersion spectroscopy with @xmath77 m class telescopes is small , candidates of the survivors are reached with the narrow - band imaging and/or low / medium - dispersion spectroscopy with @xmath77-m class telescopes , and will be good targets for the follow - up high - dispersion spectroscopy with @xmath78 m class telescopes .",
    "@xcite provided the expected number of pop iii  survivors in the milky way .",
    "they reported that an unbiased survey of @xmath10 halo stars could impose a constraint on the low mass end of the pop iii  imf .",
    "this value is more than two orders of magnitude larger than our @xmath67 model ( figure [ fig : obs ] ) . even in the @xmath45 model ,",
    "more than an order of magnitude difference exists .",
    "they used a simple model to distinguish halo and bulge stars because they adopted a semi - analytic model based on merger trees extracted from extended press - schechter theory , which could not give the spatial distribution of halos .    in the model of @xcite , there are physical processes we do not include in our model , dynamical heating of gas during mass accretion and mergers .",
    "however , they reported that the main mechanisms to suppress pop iii  star formation are metal enrichment at low redshifts and the threshold mass of the minihalo at high redshifts , both of which are included in our model by different manners .",
    "the main reason for such large difference is the adoption of the imf of pop iiistars .",
    "whereas @xcite used a logarithmically flat imf from 0.01 to 100@xmath1 , we adopted the kroupa imf from 0.15 to 1.0 @xmath1 for low mass pop iiistars .",
    "consequently , the number of low mass pop iii  stars per minihalo is also largely different . in their model ,",
    "the average number was about 0.1 for an imf in the mass range 0.65 to 100 @xmath1 ( t. hartwig 2015 , private communication ) , which is nearly two orders of magnitude smaller than our fixed @xmath67 model .",
    "this large difference is sufficient to explain large gaps in the estimation of the sample sizes needed to constrain on the low mass end of the imf . from figure",
    "[ fig : obs ] , it is easy to infer that the large difference in the estimation of sample sizes would disappear when we used the @xmath79 model , consistent with @xcite .",
    "this means that our and their results qualitatively agree with each other although there is quantitative disagreement .",
    "why is the average number of pop iii  stars per minihalo in both models so different ?",
    "the decisive difference is that the model of @xcite used the lowest mass of the imf as an arbitrary parameter and tried to constrain it whereas the number of pop iii  stars is used in our model .",
    "in fact , the lower bound of the imf 0.65@xmath1 in their model was obtained to match the sample size of hamburg / eso survey .",
    "the radial number density of survivors ( figure [ fig : dist_dm ] ) distributes more concentrated than the dark matter and qualitatively agrees with @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , although the concentration of our results are less than that of @xcite .",
    "this quantitative disagreement can be explained by the difference of cosmological parameters .",
    "the parameter @xmath80 of @xcite is 0.9 , while 0.83 is used in our simulation .",
    "the press - schechter theory predicts the number of halos of @xmath81 at @xmath82 in @xmath83 by a factor of @xmath84 larger than @xmath21 .",
    "because earlier formed progenitor halos tend to concentrate on the center of halos , larger @xmath80 should result in a higher concentration of survivors .",
    "one may imagine that the difference can be explained by the way to select tracers of the low mass pop iii  stars .",
    "whereas we use randomly selected dark matter particles in minihalos , the most bound particles were used in @xcite . since",
    "pop iii  stars should be born in the central dense regions of minihalos , they might stay there with a high probability .",
    "however , in such situations , pop iii  stars could not be long - lived low mass stars because of subsequent mass accretion . on the other hand , some of stars could be kicked away from the central regions of minihalos to regions with shallower potential , via the gravitational many body interaction ( e.g. , * ? ?",

    "our method to select pop iii  tracers mimics this latter process .    to investigate how the distribution of survivors is sensitive to the choice of tracers",
    ", we selected the most bound particle from each minihalo as tracers and calculated the radial number density distributions of survivors .",
    "compared with the randomly selected model ( @xmath45 ) , we confirm that both distributions agree well .",
    "this suggests that the criteria of pop iii  forming minihalos and adopted cosmological parameters are more important for the distributions of survivors , and cosmological radiation hydrodynamical simulations with large volume are necessary to calibrate models .      in this study , we neglect some physical processes that can affect the number of survivors",

    "@xcite studied the accretion of the ism on a star in the galactic disk and concluded that it is generally negligible . on the other hand",

    "the fe abundance of hyper metal poor stars ( hmp ) can be explained by this pollution scenario .",
    "even if we take into account this pollution effect , the models with @xmath67 are still ruled out because only two stars of [ fe / h]@xmath86 have been discovered so far .",

    "on the other hand , @xcite suggest that there is little effect on the gas evolution by the typical streaming velocity .",
    "currently the effect of the streaming velocity is highly uncertain , and thus , it is needed to evaluate it accurately through large pop iii  formation simulations .      in the present paper , we have discussed on the observational possibility of finding pop iii  survivors .",

    "on the other hand , the theoretical imf of pop iii  stars extends to @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "thus , it is worth mentioning the observations to be compared with the high mass part of the pop iii  imf .",
    "metal poor stars could have been born in the remnants of pop iiistars .",
    "hence the comparison of the abundance ratios in the atmospheres of these stars with the theoretical predictions of the nucleosynthesis in the pop iii  stars could have great significance in constraining the high mass part of the imf .",
    "in fact , the observed abundance ratios provide little evidence of pair instability supernovae ( pisne ) , which should be found if some pop iii  stars form in the range of @xmath90 .",
    "it is rather consistent with the assumption that most of the pop iii  stars are less massive than @xmath91 to supply the metals by core collapse supernovae @xcite .",
    "we have to keep in mind that we can not directly conclude the less massive ( @xmath92 ) imf is favored , because the lack of pisne pattern is only evident in very metal poor stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath93 -3 , and has not been proved for [ fe / h]@xmath94 .",
    "in fact , at [ fe / h]=@xmath95 @xcite found a possible candidate of a second generation star formed in a remnant of a massive star with @xmath96 .",
    "further observations of the stars with higher metallicity will give us more information on pop iii  imf .",
