    "formation of black - hole will be studied for brane world scenario with dark matter having dark energy in the background .",

    "also for @xmath137 near the singularity @xmath118 the dark energy becomes insignificant and the total matter is governed by dark matter . for @xmath138 , though @xmath33 and @xmath32 both approaches to infinity near the singularity , but still the dark matter dominates over the dark energy .",
    "+ further , using this solution the expression for the interaction is given by ( from equation @xmath57 ) @xmath139 which approaches to @xmath140 at the singularity .",
    "the gravitational collapse of a homogeneous spherical cloud consists of dark matter and dark energy has been considered here in the background of brane world . to study the role of dark matter and dark energy in the final outcome of gravitational collapse ,",
    "both of them have been considered separately as well as in combination with or without interaction .",
    "+ when the collapsing fluid is in the form of dark energy with equation of state @xmath76 , then the collapse will lead to a black hole for @xmath141 while the singularity will be naked for @xmath142 .",
    "however for @xmath143 the end state of collapse will depend on the magnitude of @xmath144 .",
    "( if this quantity is greater than unity then there will be black hole otherwise there will be a naked singularity ) .",
    "then the time of formation of apparent horizon is given by @xmath145 this result is distinct from einstein gravity where the critical role is played by @xmath146 and there is no restriction on the parameters involved .",
    "+ then the section iv a combination of dark matter and dark energy is considered as collapsing fluid . due to the complicated form of the equations involved solutions",
    "are obtained only for particular value of the parameters . in step",
    "i solutions are obtained for @xmath101 ( without interaction ) for @xmath91 and solutions for @xmath121 ( with interaction ) are presented in step ii for @xmath91 and @xmath131 . in both cases ,",
    "the solutions are similar . at the time of singularity",
    "the collapsing cloud is clearly trapped .",
    "but for regular initial data , the initial instant of collapse should be chosen appropriately . as it is noted that @xmath147 both at @xmath148 and @xmath87 , so @xmath60 has a finite maximum value ( at the instant @xmath149 ) .",
    "if this maximum value of @xmath60 ( which depends on the brane tension @xmath14 ) is chosen to be less than unity ( in magnitude ) then any instant around @xmath150 may be taken as the starting epoch of the collapsing process .",
    "+ thus we conclude that the brane scenario has an effect on the collapsing process .",
