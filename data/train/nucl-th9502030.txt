    "a description of ground and excited states in terms of a mean field is a well established approach in nuclear structure .",
    "most of the nuclear phenomena can be considered as manifestations of the mean field properties , or the mean field can be used as a suitable framework and the first - order approximation .",
    "the mean field results from averaging the nucleon - nucleon interactions over states of individual nucleons . the averaging procedure , which must take into account the fermi statistics of nucleons , can be formalized in terms of a variational approach , and leads to the well - known hartree - fock ( hf ) selfconsistent equations @xcite .",
    "dynamic or time - dependent phenomena can be described by a corresponding time - dependent hf method .",
    "the nuclear state is then represented by a one - body density matrix , which evolves in time according to the hamilton equations , and represents a motion of a wave packet . such an approach has been applied to genuinely time - dependent problems , like nuclear reactions , but it is in fact best suited to describe stationary collective states .",
    "the nuclear rotation is an example of a collective motion for which linear combinations of stationary states of a given spin can be identified with a rotating wave packet . in this case",
    ", a transition from the time - dependent hf theory to a stationary problem can be achieved by introducing rotating intrinsic frame of reference . in this frame , the equations of motion are time - independent , however , the resulting density matrix is not invariant with respect to the time - reversal operator . as a consequence ,",
    "the mean field obtained for such a density matrix also loses its time invariance , and acquires new terms which are odd with respect to the time reversal .    properties of nuclear time - even mean fields are known rather well , because they are reflected in multiple static phenomena which can be studied experimentally @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "very little is known about properties of the time - odd mean fields .",
    "most studies were up to now carried out either within the adiabatic @xcite or semiclassical approximations @xcite . in particular , the adiabatic approximation to the nuclear translation , rotation , or quadrupole motion leads to the well - known thouless - valatin @xcite corrections to the mass , moment of inertia , or to the vibrational mass parameters , respectively .",
    "these corrections reflect the fact that a velocity - dependent mean field should be appropriately transformed to the intrinsic frame of reference @xcite corresponding to a given collective mode .",
    "in fact , simple estimations and numerical calculations @xcite show that the inertia obtained for effective forces without the effective - mass terms ( @xmath4=@xmath5 ) are very close to those for @xmath4@xmath6@xmath5 when the thouless - valatin corrections are consistently included .",
    "fast nuclear rotation is a phenomenon in which the collective motion should be described beyond the adiabatic limit .",
    "such a cranking model has been successfully used in explaining numerous high - spin effects in nuclei @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the properties of the rotating mean field explicitly depend on the angular velocity .",
    "however , most studies performed up to now were done in terms of phenomenological mean fields , which are not selfconsistently depending on the rotating states , and , therefore , do not incorporate time - odd terms . only in ref .",
    "@xcite an attempt has been made to include the effects of a zero - range interaction within the nilsson single - particle mean field .",
    "full selfconsistent cranking calculations @xcite are still rather scarce , and no explicit analysis of the time - odd mean - field components is available .    on the other hand , the discovery of the superdeformation @xcite , and the resulting avalanche of very precise data on high - spin states , allow for an attempt to study these unknown aspects of the nuclear mean field . in particular , the phenomenon of identical bands ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) provides an extremely rich and puzzling information on properties of fast rotating states . in terms of the mean field approaches explicitly depending on the time - odd components ,",
    "the calculated identical @xmath7-ray transitions have been obtained in two cases only , namely , ( i ) the hf cranking calculations with skyrme interaction gave yrast band of @xmath8hg identical to an excited band in @xmath8pb @xcite , and ( ii ) the identical bands in @xmath2dy and @xmath1 tb ( excited band ) were obtained in the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) theory @xcite . in both studies ,",
    "the authors invoked the time - odd components of the mean field as a crucial element of the obtained results .    in the present study we aim at a detailed analysis of these time - odd terms in the context of the identical bands phenomenon .",
    "we focus our attention on two classic and experimentally well studied pairs of identical bands , namely , on those in @xmath2dy and @xmath1 tb ( excited band ) , and in @xmath1 tb and @xmath3gd ( excited band ) .",
    "we perform our calculations in terms of the hf cranking method with the skyrme interactions .",
    "it was not in our intentions to give here a full account of the time - reversal breaking description that the selconsistent hf cranking approach really offers and the experiment may test .",
    "such a field of studies seems to emerge now in relation with the fast progress in the available experimental information . in particular",
    ", our choice of the illustrative material purposely minimizes rather than maximizes a possible magnitude of the time - odd effects .",
    "this is so , because we mainly discuss the role of the @xmath9{1/2}$ ] nilsson orbital known to interact only weakly via the coriolis term in the hamiltonian .    in all standard approaches , such as the woods - saxon ( ws ) , nilsson ,",
    "hf , or rmf cranking models , one signature member of this orbital is to a good approximation given by a staight line as a function of the angular velocity .",
    "this type of dependence can be opposed to dramatic changes of other aligning or interacting orbitals which are much more sensitive to the rotating field and hence to its time - odd components . on the other hand ,",
    "the specific behavior of the discussed orbital induces a regular behavior of various observables , and has a great advantage in the fact that the level repulsion or level crosings do not disturb the comparisons of primary interest here .    in section  [ sec3 ]",
    "we discuss the skyrme interaction and energy density with a particular emphasis on the relations between the time - even and time - odd components of the mean field .",
    "the hf cranking calculations are presented in section  [ sec4 ] , where several variants of the skyrme functional are used and the influence of the time - odd terms on the rotational properties is analyzed , and conclusions are presented in section  [ sec6 ] .",
    "the skyrme energy functional @xcite is a three - dimensional integral @xmath10 of the energy density @xmath11 which can be represented as a sum of the kinetic energy and of the potential - energy isoscalar and isovector terms @xmath12 where @xmath13 with @xmath14and the isospin index @xmath15 can have values 0 or 1 .",
    "coupling constants @xmath16 have superscripts corresponding to various density functions appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq109 ] ) .",
    "all of these coupling constants can , in principle , depend on particle densities , see refs .",
    "@xcite , but the most common choice @xcite restricts the density dependence to the @xmath17 and @xmath18 terms . in appendix  [ appa ]",
    "we give coupling constants @xmath16 expressed through the traditional parameters of the skyrme interaction .",
    "apart from the density - dependent coupling constants , the isoscalar energy density , @xmath19 , depends on the isoscalar density functions and the isovector one , @xmath20 , depends on the isovector density functions . for the particle densities , @xmath21 , the isoscalar and",
    "isovector parts are defined in the usual way as a sum and a difference of the proton and neutron contributions , respectively , @xmath22 and analogous expressions are used to define other densities .",
    "altogether we have to consider six position - dependent density functions @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 with definitions given in ref .",
    "whenever the isospin indices are omitted , we understand that the symbols may refer either to the isoscalar ( @xmath15=0 ) or isovector ( @xmath15=1 ) parts .    in the energy densities ( [ eq109 ] )",
    "there appear two scalar time - even density functions , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , one vector time - odd , @xmath25 , and two pseudo - vector time - odd ones , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and one pseudo - tensor time - even density function , @xmath28 .",
    "the vector time - even density @xmath29 which appears in eq .",
    "( [ eq109 ] ) is given by the antisymmetric part of the pseudo - tensor density , i.e. , @xmath30=@xmath31 , and is not an independent quantity .",
    "terms in @xmath32 and @xmath33 are bilinear in time - even and time - odd densities , respectively .",
    "therefore , we denote them by the superscripts `` even '' and `` odd '' .",
    "this notation is only used to indicate the dependence on two different classes of densities .",
    "it should not be confused with the fact that both @xmath34 and @xmath33 are of course _ even _ with respect to the time reversal . to every term in @xmath32",
    "there corresponds an analogous term in @xmath35 , as seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq109 ] ) .      by varying the energy density ( [ eq109 ] ) with respect to the six density functions",
    "@xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 one obtains the mean fields .",
    "details of calculations are presented in ref .",
    "here we only repeat the final results conforming to the notation introduced above .",
    "time - even and time - odd mean fields are obtained by a variation of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively , and they read @xmath36these fields are given by the six potential functions @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 which have tensor transformation properties respectively identical to the six density functions on which they depend through the following formulae    @xmath43    the tensor gradient operators in eqs .",
    "( [ eq209 ] ) and ( [ eq210e ] ) are defined @xcite as @xmath44=@xmath45 and @xmath46@xmath47@xmath48 .",
    "due to the density dependence of the coupling constants @xmath17 and @xmath49 one has to add to the isoscalar potential energy @xmath50 the rearrangement terms @xcite resulting from the variation of these coupling constants with respect to the isoscalar particle density , i.e. , @xmath51 these terms introduce an explicit dependence of the complete time - even isoscalar potential @xmath50+@xmath52 on the isovector density @xmath53 and on the time - odd densities @xmath54 .",
    "similar terms have to be also consistently taken into account whenever some other coupling constants are assumed to be density dependent .    finally , the neutron and proton hamiltonians , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , are obtained by combining the kinetic energy with the isoscalar and isovector mean fields : @xmath57    we are now in a position to discuss different time - odd terms in the mean fields .",
    "it is clear that the time - odd mean fields , @xmath58 , in eq .",
    "( [ eq209 ] ) directly result from the `` odd '' part , @xmath35 , of the energy density in ( [ eq109 ] ) , and depend on 10 time - odd coupling constants @xmath49 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 for @xmath15=0 and @xmath15=1 .",
    "similarly , the time - even mean fields depend on 10 time - even coupling constants @xmath17 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 . for the skyrme interaction ,",
    "the time - odd coupling constants are linear combinations of the time - even ones ( see appendix  [ appa ] ) , and therefore the time - odd mean fields are uniquely determined from the time - even mean fields . since the time - even fields are tested against numerous experimental observations which have a static character , they are much better known then the time - odd ones .",
    "in fact , the skyrme force parameters have been in the past almost uniquely fitted to the static properties only .",
    "a description of dynamic properties which do depend on the time - odd fields does not therefore ( for the skyrme force ) require new parameters to be introduced and fitted .",
    "on the other hand , one sometimes adopts a different point of view by considering the energy density to be a more fundamental construction than the skyrme interaction itself @xcite .",
    "in such a case , all 20 coupling constants of eq .",
    "( [ eq109 ] ) should be treated and adjusted independently . however , in the next section we show that some relations between time - odd and time - even coupling constants have an origin in the local gauge invariance of the energy density .",
    "as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the energy density derived from the skyrme interaction the kinetic density @xmath24 and the current density @xmath25 appear in the characteristic combination of @xmath67@xmath68@xmath69 .",
    "the same is true for two other pairs of densities appearing together in the combinations @xmath70@xmath71@xmath72@xmath68@xmath73 and @xmath74@xmath71@xmath75@xmath76@xmath77@xmath78@xmath79 .",
    "this gives the following relations between three pairs of time - even and time - odd coupling constants    @xmath80    the skyrme functional has now the form @xmath81    in ref .",
    "@xcite this structure has been interpreted as a result of the galilean invariance of the skyrme interaction . however , it has a deeper origin in the fact that the skyrme force is locally gauge invariant . in order to illustrate the role of the locally gauge invariant ,",
    "velocity dependent interactions let us consider an arbitrary finite - range and non - local , but velocity independent interaction given by @xmath82 to simplify the notation we disregard for a moment the spin and isospin variables .",
    "@xmath83 describes an interaction process where the particles 1 and 2 are located at @xmath84 and @xmath85 before the interaction , and at @xmath86 and @xmath87 after the interaction .",
    "when the system of particles is described by a one - body density matrix @xmath88 , its hf interaction energy reads @xmath89 for a local gauge transformation of the many - body hf wave function @xmath90 , @xmath91 where @xmath92 is an arbitrary real function of the position @xmath93 , one obtains the following gauge - transformed one - body density matrix @xmath94    the general interaction energy ( [ e202 ] ) is not invariant with respect to such a transformation .",
    "however , when the interaction is local @xcite , @xmath95 the corresponding interaction energy , @xmath96 becomes invariant with respect to the local gauge .",
    "the direct term is invariant because it depends only on the gauge - invariant local densities , which are denoted by the single argument , i.e. , @xmath97@xmath98@xmath99 . on the other hand , in the exchange term",
    "the gauge factors coming from two density matrices cancel one another .",
    "when the density functions defining the skyrme energy functional ( [ eq109 ] ) are calculated for the gauge - transformed density matrix ( [ eq203 ] ) one obtains the following relations :    @xmath100    and the three characteristic combinations of density functions , which appear in the energy density of eq .",
    "( [ eq109c ] ) , are then explicitly gauge invariant .",
    "transformation properties of @xmath24 and @xmath25 allow to interpret @xmath101 as a velocity field , @xmath102 which shows that the flow of matter obtained through the gauge transformation is irrotational , @xmath103@xmath78@xmath104=0 .",
    "the local gauge invariance of the skyrme interaction reflects the fact that its velocity dependence has been introduced only to simulate the finite range effects of the effective interaction . in this way",
    "the skyrme interaction conserves the local gauge invariance of a velocity - independent finite - range local interaction , such as the gogny force @xcite , for example .",
    "the galilean invariance is a special case of the local gauge invariance , for which the phase in eq .",
    "( [ eq111 ] ) is given by @xmath105 where @xmath106 is a constant linear momentum of the boost transformation .",
    "since the interaction energy does not depend on @xmath106 , the total energy ( [ eq107 ] ) is only modified through the kinetic energy [ the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq108 ] ) ] . using the transformation property of @xmath24 , eq .",
    "( [ eq112b ] ) , we have the energy increase under the boost transformation , @xmath107 equal to the translational energy of the boosted system .",
    "this result holds for an initially stationary solution ( i.e. , for vanishing currents , @xmath25=0 ) , however , due to the transformation property of @xmath25 , eq .  ( [ eq112d ] ) , the boost transformations can be added to one another by adding the corresponding momenta @xmath106 . for the boost transformation ,",
    "one obtains the obvious velocity field ( [ eq212 ] ) , i.e. , @xmath108      since the velocity field ( [ eq212 ] ) obtained through a gauge transformation is irrotational , it can not correctly describe physical rotations of nuclei .",
    "this is so , because the nuclei basically rotate as rigid bodies ( at least in the independent - particle approximation @xcite ) , and the velocity field of a rigid - body rotation , @xmath109=@xmath110 , has a non - zero curl , @xmath103@xmath78@xmath109=2@xmath111 , i.e. , is not irrotational .",
    "of course , interactions and nucleon - nucleon correlations ( pairing ) introduce an irrotational component in the velocity field ( moment of inertia decreases below the rigid - body value ) , but this field is never entirely irrotational .    in an analogy to the boost transformation , one may try to induce the rotation of a many - fermion system by adding for all particles a constant value , @xmath112 , to their projections of the angular momentum on a fixed ( say @xmath113 ) axis .",
    "such a procedure can be realized in terms of the twirl transformation given by the gauge function @xmath114 its velocity field has the form @xmath115 where @xmath111 is the vector of angular velocity oriented along the @xmath113 axis , and @xmath116 is the distance to this axis .",
    "one can see that the velocity field ( [ eq213 ] ) is singular at the rotation axis .",
    "the energy increase resulting from the kinetic energy density ( [ eq112b ] ) is then infinite for any arbitrarily small @xmath112 .",
    "the irrotational velocity field ( [ eq213 ] ) is of course very much different from the rigid - rotation velocity field , @xmath109 , even though both contain the same factor @xmath110 .",
    "this illustrative example shows that the nuclear rotation can not be realized by democratically distributing the angular momentum among all particles . in the cranking approximation , at a given value of the angular velocity",
    "some particles receive larger contributions ( aligning states ) and some smaller contributions ( high-@xmath117 states ) .",
    "a precise distribution can not be found without actually solving the quantal cranking equations .",
    "this example also shows that the gauge - invariant interaction must contribute to the rotational energy , contrary to what happens in the case of the translational motion .",
    "in the present study we have performed the hartree - fock ( hf ) calculations of superdeformed rotational bands using the skyrme effective interactions .",
    "the calculations have been done using the numerical code hfodd which employs a three - dimensional cartesian deformed harmonic oscillator ( ho ) basis to describe the single - particle wave functions . the details concerning the hfodd code will be presented elsewhere @xcite ; here we only give a few of its basic parameters pertaining to the present application .",
    "the calculations have been performed using a fixed basis given by the ho frequencies @xmath118=11.200 and @xmath119=6.246mev in the directions perpendicular and parallel to the symmetry axis , respectively .",
    "these values have been obtained by standard prescriptions developed for diagonalizing the deformed ws hamiltonian @xcite in the ho basis , and correspond to the ws potential with deformations @xmath120=0.61 and @xmath121=0.10 .",
    "the basis has been restricted to a fixed number , @xmath38 , of basis states having the lowest single - particle ho energies @xmath122=@xmath123+@xmath124+@xmath125+@xmath126+@xmath127 .",
    "the actual calculations have been performed with @xmath38=306 .",
    "this corresponds to the maximal numbers of oscillator quanta equal to 8 and 15 in the perpendicular and parallel directions , respectively .",
    "the stability of results with respect to increasing the size of the ho basis has been tested by performing calculations with @xmath38=604 , which introduces basis states up to 11 and 20 quanta in these two directions .",
    "it has been found that the rotational characteristics of the studied nuclei are almost independent of such an increase .",
    "for example , numerical inaccuracies in the dynamical moment @xmath0 and in the total angular momentum @xmath128 can be estimated to be smaller than 0.2@xmath129mev@xmath130 and 0.1@xmath131 , respectively .",
    "inaccuracies of relative values between different angular frequencies @xmath132 , or between different nuclei , are smaller than these estimates , because the numerical errors then cancel out .    in the present study we aim at investigating the role of different time - odd terms in the selfconsistent mean fields ( [ eq209 ] ) obtained for rotating superdeformed nuclei . as discussed in section  [ sec3 ] , this can be done by considering different values of 10 time - odd coupling constants appearing in the skyrme energy density , eq .",
    "( [ eq109 ] ) . for every given set of values of coupling constants we perform full selfconsistent calculations within the hf cranking method .",
    "in the present study , pairing correlations are not taken into account .",
    "below we separately discuss three cases corresponding to ( i ) the complete skyrme functional , ( ii ) the skyrme functional with certain time - odd terms omitted , but with the gauge invariance preserved , and ( iii ) with the gauge invariance violated .    as discussed in section  [ sec2 ] , the energy functionals corresponding to the standard skyrme interactions preserve the local gauge invariance .",
    "the 20 coupling constants appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq109 ] ) are then restricted by 6 conditions ( [ eq215a])-([eq215c ] ) , which leads to the energy density of eq .  ( [ eq109c ] ) . in table",
    "[ tab1 ] , the remaining 14 coupling constants are listed for the siii @xcite , skm * @xcite , and skp @xcite skyrme interactions .",
    "the values of the density - dependent coupling constants @xmath17 and @xmath133 are given for the vacuum ( @xmath23=0 ) and for the nuclear - matter saturation density ( @xmath23=@xmath134 ) characterizing a given force .",
    "the time - even coupling constants corresponding to the siii , skm * , and skp interactions are rather similar .",
    "the main difference consists in different values of the isoscalar - effective - mass coupling constant @xmath135 which is equal to 0 for skp ( effective mass @xmath136=1 ) , and 44.4mev@xmath71@xmath137 and 34.7mev@xmath71@xmath137 for siii and skm * , respectively ( effective masses @xmath136=0.76 and 0.79 ) . apart from that , the absolute values of the @xmath138 coupling constants are larger for skp than for siii and skm * , which gives better symmetry - energy properties @xcite within the skp parametrization as compared to the other two forces . on the other hand ,",
    "the skm * parameters have been adjusted so as to properly describe the surface energy at large deformation , and therefore this interaction was successfully applied in numerous studies of superdeformation .",
    "values of the time - odd coupling constants corresponding to the three skyrme interactions , table  [ tab1 ] , differ much more than those of the time - even ones .",
    "this illustrates uncertainties in determining the time - odd components of the mean field .",
    "the differences partly result from the fact that skp has been adjusted to give attractive matrix elements in the pairing channel , while those given by siii and skm * are repulsive .",
    "one should bear in mind , however , that for the skyrme interaction the time - odd coupling constants are unique functions of the time - even ones ( see appendix  [ appa ] ) and , in principle , one has no freedom for an independent readjustment .",
    "such a readjustment is possible only if we consider the hf theory based directly on the energy density functional and not on the skyrme interaction .    in the previous applications of the skyrme force to nuclear rotation @xcite , in the energy density ( [ eq109c ] ) the terms @xmath59 and @xmath139",
    "have been neglected in order to facilitate the calculations .",
    "the first of these terms gives purely time - odd contribution to the mean field , while the second one gives both time - even and time - odd contributions , because the gauge invariance implies that @xmath139=@xmath140 , eq .",

    "in fact , the term @xmath140 has also been usually neglected in most skyrme parametrizations applied to problems where the time - reversal symmetry is concerved , cf .",
    "ref . @xcite .",
    "since the hfodd code is organized in a different way , omitting some terms would not provide any serious simplifications , and the code may in fact handle the complete skyrme functional .",
    "this gives us a possibility to test the importance of different terms for the rotational properties of nuclei .",
    "there exist several high - spin observables which , when calculated from the hf solutions ( wave functions ) behave differently depending on whether various time - odd terms are included or not .",
    "this offers , in principle , a possibility of both better readjustment of the interaction coupling constants and better understanding of the underlying mechanisms .",
    "some of the physical quantities , as e.g. alignments and @xmath0-moments of intruder orbitals , are well recognized as responding strongly to the coriolis and centrifugal interaction effects .",
    "the same quantities are expected to respond relatively strongly to the time - odd terms in the mean - field hamiltonian .",
    "similarly , various families of orbitals having large high-@xmath141 components are systematically responsible for such precisely measurable effects as band - crossings ( back- or up - bending effects ) and related phenomena .    in this study",
    "we would like to illustrate the effects of the time - odd terms on yet another seemingly more subtle mechanism related to identical bands , leaving the aformentioned analysis of intruder orbitals for a later investigation .    in the following sections we present results of the hf cranking calculations for the yrast superdeformed bands in dysprosium , @xmath2dy(1 ) , and terbium , @xmath1tb(1 ) , and for the first excited bands in the corresponding isotones , @xmath1tb(2 ) and @xmath3gd(2 ) .",
