    "consider a very large nucleus , probably larger than can be physically realized .",
    "the nucleons are distributed homogeneously inside the nucleus .",
    "recently l. mclerran and r. venugopalan proposed a program of computing the gluon distribution fuctions for such a nucleus at small @xmath0 [ 1,2 ] .",
    "one of the interesting problems in the mclerran - venugopalan model for the small-@xmath0 part of the gluon distribution of such a large nucleus [ 1,2 ] is finding the classical solution for the gluon field treating the valence quarks of the nucleons in the nucleus as recoiless sources , which are delta functions along the light - cone when the nucleus is moving near the velocity of light . a convenient way to deal with the problem is by working in the light - cone gauge .",
    "the source is characterized by a two - dimensional color charge density @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a vector in the transverse direction .",
    "the proposed model assumes that in order to find the average value of any observable having longitudinal coherence length long compared to the nucleus , one calculates this observable for a given @xmath3 , and then averages it over all @xmath4 with the measure @xmath5 \\exp\\left ( -{1\\over 2{\\mu}^2 } \\int d^2 { x } { \\rho ^2 } ( \\underline{x } ) \\right ) , \\label{distrib}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the average charge density squared .",
    "we consider a large nucleus consisting of `` nucleons '' , which for simplicity of description are chosen to be just quark - antiquark pairs ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . valence quark and antiquark are treated as point particles free to move inside of the nucleon , but unable to get out .",
    "we are interested in the gluon field of the ultrarelativistic nucleus viewed in the laboratory frame .",
    "we assume that the field in each individual nucleon is not large .",
    "this allows us to approximate the covariant gauge potential of each quark by a single gluon exchange . in a covariant gauge the classical field of a single ultrarelativistic particle",
    "is proportional to a delta - function in the @xmath7 direction [ 3 ] . since in our model of ultrarelativistic nucleus",
    "different quarks have different @xmath7 coordinates in the laboratory frame , the fields of individual quarks do nt overlap , which allows us to superimpose them and justifies our single gluon exchange approximation",
    ". then the total field of the nucleus in the covariant gauge is the sum of the quark fields .",
    "we make a gauge transformation which changes the total potential to the light - cone gauge .",
    "so , we get a solution to the classical equations of motion in light - cone gauge , where the field , @xmath8 , is directly related to the gluon distribution in the small-@xmath0 region [ 1 ] .    following mclerran and venugopalan the nucleus",
    "is considered to be very large , thus although the field of each individual nucleon is weak , the total field is strong at low momentum in the light - cone gauge due to the overlap of the fields of a huge number of nucleons .",
    "still we can neglect the contributions of several nucleons , without changing the answer , i.e. , we work in the leading power of the number of nucleons .",
    "we may treat the source as classical only when we are at sufficiently small momenta that the individual quarks can not be resolved .",
    "it was shown in [ 1 ] that this requires that @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the typical momentum scale .",
    "the weak coupling approximation is valid when @xmath11 .",
    "then the momentum range we consider is @xmath12 .",
    "now the task is to construct the two - dimensional charge density , giving the correct classical solution .",
    "this is done by just substituting the classical solution in the equations of motion .",
    "the density we find this way happens to satisfy the gaussian distribution .",
    "we show this by calculating the correlation functions of the densities at different transverse points and proving that they are exactly what one would expect for the gaussian distribution ( [ distrib ] ) .",
    "that is we justify the method for averaging the observables proposed by mclerran and venugopalan .    in sect .",

    "4 we show that the charge density has a gaussian distribution by calculating the correlation functions .    in sect .",
    "5 we confirm the techniques proposed in [ 1 ] .",
    "we start with some random distribution of nucleons in the nucleus and quarks and antiquarks in the nucleons . the nucleons , in the rest frame of the nucleus ,",
    "are assumed to be spheres with equal radius , and the quarks and antiquarks are distributed randomly inside each sphere , with equal probability to be at any place inside the sphere , but with zero probability to get outside .",

    "the reason we separate them is because @xmath21 comes from the current @xmath22 , so the expression for @xmath21 should include a @xmath18 acting in each individual nucleon s color space .    in the laboratory frame for the ultra - relativistic nucleus",

    "the prime at the field or the field strength denotes the covariant gauge .",
    "the field strength in the covariant gauge is then @xmath26 from here on the subscript @xmath27 will mean that the object is a vector in the transverse space over this index .",
    "we now do a gauge transformation to transorm this field into the light - cone gauge .",
    "the potential in a new gauge is @xmath28 requiring the new gauge to be the light - cone gauge , @xmath29 , we obtain @xmath30 then the field in the light cone gauge is @xmath31 only transverse components are non - zero . substituting @xmath32 from ( [ covfs ] ) we get @xmath33 @xmath34 this is our estimate of the solution of the classical equations of motion for a given configuration of quarks inside the nucleons and nucleons inside the nucleus . formula [ [ clsol ] ]",

    "the contribution of each individual nucleon is negligible , it s their sum which matters .",
    "that means we can neglect these `` last '' nucleons .",
