    "<S> we present candidates for the global minimum energy solitons of charge one to nine in the skyrme model , generated using sophisticated numerical algorithms . assuming the skyrme model accurately represents the low energy limit of qcd </S>",
    "<S> , these configurations correspond to the classical nuclear ground states of the light elements . </S>",
    "<S> the solitons found are particularly symmetric , for example , the charge seven skyrmion has icosahedral symmetry , and the shapes are shown to fit a remarkable sequence defined by a geometric energy minimization ( gem ) rule . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate the energies and sizes to within at least a few percent accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> these calculations provide the basis for a future investigation of the low energy vibrational modes of skyrmions and hence the possibility of testing the skyrme model against experiment .    </S>",
    "<S> epsf    = cmu10 scaled1 = cmss12    the skyrme model presents an opportunity to understand nuclear physics as a low energy limit of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . </S>",
    "<S> it was first proposed as a theory of strong interactions of hadrons@xcite , but after a hiatus which lasted nearly twenty years it was shown to be in fact the low energy limit of qcd in the large @xmath0 limit@xcite . since </S>",
    "<S> then much work has suggested that the topological solitons in the model , known as skyrmions , can indeed be identified with classical ground states of light nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> however , before a more quantitative assessment of the validity of the model can be made , a thorough understanding of the structure and dynamics of multi - soliton configurations is required .    </S>",
    "<S> this is a highly non - trivial task since the skyrme model has many features which obstruct both analytic and numerical progress . </S>",
    "<S> there are two promising lines of attack . </S>",
    "<S> the first is to use the approximate correspondence between skyrme fields and su(2 ) instantons@xcite . using this semi - analytic approach </S>",
    "<S> , one can understand the right - angle scattering of two skyrmions@xcite and also calculate symmetric configurations of , for example , charge three and four@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the second is to use state of the art computer technology and a sophisticated numerical algorithm to evolve the dynamics of discretized configurations . </S>",
    "<S> this approach has the advantage of being quantitatively accurate , but has many other more practical difficulties associated with it , in particular the substantial computer resources required . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , it has been possible to design a working code which can evolve the dynamics of low energy configurations for many timesteps and also be modified to relax dynamically towards what are at least local minimum energy configurations .    in a recent letter@xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we presented the first results from our code , exhibiting the dynamics of symmetric configurations in the attractive channel and also the minima for charges one to four . </S>",
    "<S> these minima were already known from numerical relaxation calculations@xcite and also from instanton calculations@xcite . in this letter , we present what we describe as candidate minima for charges one to nine , which we firmly believe are in fact the global minima . </S>",
    "<S> these minima can be classified in terms of the isosurfaces of baryon density ( or energy density ) , which are seen to fit a remarkable pattern , obeying what we shall call a geometric energy minimization ( gem ) rule . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate accurately the energy and average size of each soliton . as in ref.@xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we shall assume the pion mass is zero  results for a physical value of the pion mass will be presented in future work . </S>",
    "<S> we do not expect that inclusion of a finite pion mass will effect the overall shape and symmetry of the soliton , rather it will just modify its energy and size .    </S>",
    "<S> the lagrangian of the massless skyrme model may be written in terms of the su(2 ) valued right currents @xmath1 as @xmath2[r^\\mu , r^\\nu])\\ , \\label{lag}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 and we have used scaled units of energy , @xmath4 , and length , @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> one can convert to an o(4 ) sigma model representation @xmath6 as described in refs.@xcite and deduce the dynamical equations of motion for @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the baryon density @xmath8 , whose spatial integral gives the integer - valued baryon number @xmath9 , is given by @xmath10 where latin indices run over the spatial values @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the above units are chosen so that the fadeev - bogomolny bound on the energy @xmath12 is simply @xmath13 .    </S>",
    "<S> the full details of the numerical methods are presented in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this includes an account of how the numerical algorithm works , how to construct the initial conditions and why we believe that the configurations represent the global minima . for the purposes of this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we include a brief outline for the layman . </S>",
    "<S> the basic procedure is to set up discretized initial conditions for static low energy configurations using either a simple ansatz for a single skyrmion and the product ansatz , or by calculating the holonomy of instantons , or a combination of both , as is the case for the higher charge configurations . </S>",
    "<S> the critical feature of the specific configurations chosen is that the skyrmions are in an attractive or nearly attractive channel . </S>",
    "<S> these configurations are then evolved using the discretized equations of motion . </S>",
    "<S> as the dynamics proceeds the system oscillates between maxima and minima of the potential energy . </S>",
    "<S> if one stops the dynamics at a minimum of the potential energy and then removes all the kinetic energy from the system , that is , set the time derivatives of the field to zero , the solution will gradually move towards a local minimum of the system . </S>",
    "<S> once the system is close to the minimum one can also incorporate dissipation which will speed up the process of relaxation . of course , as with any numerical minimization procedure , one can not be sure that one has found the global minimum . </S>",
    "<S> however , given sufficiently asymmetric , but attractive , initial conditions , as created using the product ansatz , it is likely that one will locate the global minimum .    for charges one to four it was possible to construct configurations using just the product ansatz , in which all the skyrmions are in a mutually attractive channel@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is not possible to use this naive approach to construct a maximally attractive channel of charge five or higher and therefore one must consider other approaches . in order for our algorithm to relax quickly to the minimum , we must construct a configuration with low energy , in which most of the skyrmions are attractive . </S>",
    "<S> it need not be the maximally attractive channel , but the algorithm will relax to the minimum quicker if it is close to the most attractive . </S>",
    "<S> some of the configurations chosen relax quicker than others , suggesting that in some cases we have selected the correct configuration and in others we have found one which works , but is perhaps not the best .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that it is best to mix the instanton approach for a known symmetric configuration , with a small number of single skyrmions added using the product ansatz to break the exact symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in the case of @xmath9=@xmath14 , it possible to construct a highly attractive configuration by adding in two single skyrmions either side of a @xmath9=@xmath15 tetrahedron . </S>",
    "<S> since the pion fields of the tetrahedron are similar to those of an anti - skyrmion at large distances , the configuration is of low energy and relaxes extremely quickly ( @xmath161000 timesteps ) to the minimum . using the analogy , to @xmath9=@xmath17 to @xmath9=@xmath18 scattering , we tried constructing @xmath9=@xmath19 and @xmath9=@xmath20 configurations by surrounding a @xmath9=@xmath15 tetrahedron with skyrmions in cyclic and tetrahedral configurations respectively using the product ansatz . </S>",
    "<S> these configurations relaxed toward the minimum in over 5000 timesteps , suggesting that in fact these are not the maximally attractive channel . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , they are of reasonably low energy and work eventually . for @xmath9=@xmath19 , one can relax to the minimum much more quickly by colliding two tetrahedra . </S>",
    "<S> reassuringly , it is the same minima as calculated before , providing a useful consistency check . in order to calculate configurations of higher charge @xmath21 </S>",
    "<S> , one can just add in a single skyrmion to the known minima of charge one less .    a useful way to represent </S>",
    "<S> a skyrmion is by displaying a surface of constant baryon density . in fig .  1 we display isosurfaces for the skyrmions of charge five to nine ( one to four are presented in ref.@xcite ) , using the same constant value for the baryon density in each case , to ensure that the relative sizes of the skyrmions are accurately represented . </S>",
    "<S> the baryon density has maxima at several points in space , which we can think of as vertices of a solid , and these are connected by links of slightly lower baryon density , which can be regarded as the edges of the solid . </S>",
    "<S> clearly in this way we can assign a solid to each skyrmion which accurately reflects the shape and symmetry of the skyrmion . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , for all the skyrmions we consider , the associated solid is remarkably close to being composed of regular or nearly regular polygons with a fixed edge length . given this fascinating result </S>",
    "<S> , we shall describe each solid in terms of its construction from polygons . </S>",
    "<S> included in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 alongside each baryon density plot is a photograph of the associated solid , constructed using a molecular model building kit . in table 1 </S>",
    "<S> we list the number of faces of each associated solid , together with the number of each type of polygon from which it is constructed .    </S>",
    "<S> [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     * table 2 * : calculated values of the charge ( @xmath22 ) , energy ( @xmath23 ) and soliton size ( @xmath24 ) in natural and physical units for @xmath25 to @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> also presented is the ionization energy @xmath27 , which is the energy required to remove one skyrmion . for a discussion of the accuracy of the results and comparison to previous calculations </S>",
    "<S> see the text .    </S>",
    "<S> we have calculated the discrete charge and energy for the minima on @xmath28 grids , which are displayed in table 2 . </S>",
    "<S> these energy values are less than the true values since the grid size is finite , but they are nonetheless within 2% accurate . </S>",
    "<S> one can make a better estimate of the overall energy by using the ratio @xmath29 as discussed in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen to be exact to 3 decimal places for the @xmath9=@xmath30 skyrmion and we suggest that it will be so for all the others=@xmath30 to @xmath9=@xmath18 differ very slightly from those presented in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the current values are the result of further relaxation of the same configurations . ] , since the third decimal place has not changed for many ( @xmath311000 ) timesteps . </S>",
    "<S> these values have been used to calculate the ionization energy ( @xmath32 ) , that is , the energy required to remove one skyrmion , which in general gives an indication of the classical binding energy . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account the fact that these energies will be modified by the quantisation of zero modes and also some low energy vibration modes , there is a remarkable trend which follows the pattern of light element binding energies . </S>",
    "<S> we have also calculated the average size of the soliton @xmath24 from the second moment of the baryon distribution as in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this value is extremely rough since it ignores the symmetries of the object , but nonetheless it gives an indication of the overall trend .    </S>",
    "<S> we should comment on the relevance of our work to previous calculations . in numerical work@xcite , </S>",
    "<S> similar to ours , configurations up to charge six were studied using a global minimization algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> our results for charges five and six differ from these earlier computations , which we attribute to numerical effects in the earlier work due to lack of resources ; for example , the grid we use contains almost five - times the number of points . for charge five </S>",
    "<S> the difference is small , we obtain the same symmetry group but identify different polygons forming the solid , which is possible thanks to our improved grid resolution . for charge six our results are very different , as we find a very symmetric configuration , whereas the earlier computation gave a structure with very little symmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> a different approach to constructing high charge configurations has used the skyrme crystal@xcite and involves cutting out sections@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although these configurations have low energy , they are not as low as those presented here , and they are fundamentally different in nature . </S>",
    "<S> the configurations presented here are shells with less baryon density in the centre , whereas those created from the skyrme crystal have internal structure since they are created from cubic configurations . </S>",
    "<S> such structures do not fit the gem rules since they are not trivalent . </S>",
    "<S> it is an open question as to whether the shell structure persists for higher charge .    </S>",
    "<S> we believe that the candidate minima which we have presented here are in fact the global minima since the initial conditions have natural asymmetry , we have in some cases got the same configuration from two different initial conditions and most of all the isosurfaces of the baryon density fit a remarkable sequence of polygons . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry properties of these polygons could be the starting point for an understanding of the moduli space structure of the skyrme model , leading to a study of low energy dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the physical properties of these classical nuclear ground states follow the trend of light elements , at least qualitatively , providing the impetus for a study of the low energy vibrational modes and the potential for a confrontation between the skyrme model and nuclear experiments . </S>",
