    "larmor s formula of electromagnetism @xcite states that an electric charge in uniform motion does not radiate . however , there are two ways to have radiation from a charge moving with constant velocity .",
    "the first way is to have a particle moving in a medium with velocity exceeding the phase velocity of light in that medium .",
    "this gives rise to the well - known vavilov - cherenkov radiation @xcite .",
    "the second way is to consider charge motion in inhomogeneous media .",
    "ginzburg and frank @xcite first discussed this effect by investigating a particle in uniform motion which crosses a planar interface between two media with dissimilar refractive index .",
    "this kind of radiation is known as transition radiation @xcite .",
    "more generally , any motion near finite - size objects also induces radiation , in a process called diffraction radiation @xcite .",
    "one of the first experimental verifications on this effect was provided by smith and purcell @xcite .",
    "the smith - purcell experimental set - up consisted of an electron moving close to the surface of a metal diffraction grating at right angles to the rulings .",
    "the theory of the smith - purcell effect has been discussed by several authors @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show the existence of gravitational diffraction radiation ( gdr ) and discuss its physical effects .",
    "the model under consideration is a braneworld scenario @xcite such as , for example , the randall - sundrum i model @xcite .",
    "braneworld models have attracted a lot of interest in recent years , revolutionizing our view of how our universe may be described .",
    "the central idea of braneworld scenarios is that the visible universe is restricted to a four - dimensional brane inside a higher - dimensional space , called the bulk .",
    "the additional dimensions are taken to be compact and other branes may be moving through the bulk .",
    "interactions of the visible brane with the bulk and hidden branes introduce effects not seen in standard physics .    in this set - up , a particle in uniform motion on the visible brane radiates gravitational waves due to the presence of a second ( hidden ) brane at finite distance , which plays the role of the metal diffraction grating of the smith - purcell experiment .",
    "gdr on the visible brane is generated by inhomogeneities on the hidden brane due , for example , to bulk - brane interactions and brane fluctuations @xcite .",
    "we will show that the amount of gdr depends on the size of extra dimensions and the length scale of brane perturbations .",
    "this result is general and independent on the fine details of the model . without loss of generality , in our computations we will consider a flat five - dimensional spacetime with the extra dimension taking values within the interval",

    "we replace the the gravitational field components with a single scalar degree of freedom , i.e.  rewrite the above equation as @xmath11 .",
    "this is a common procedure @xcite .",

    "if a hidden brane is present , the green s function has to be modified to take into account its effects .",
    "the hidden brane can be thought as a wall parallel to the particle direction of propagation at distance @xmath29 . by repeating the steps leading to eq.([powerangle ] ) it is straightforward to show that there is no radiation for uniform motion parallel to the wall .",
    "this result can be understood by boosting the solution to the rest frame of the particle .",
    "the problem is reduced to a static problem with one image particle on the other side of the wall .",
    "clearly , the reduction to the static configuration is only possible if the brane is smooth and infinite in the @xmath4 direction .",
    "if the brane is inhomogeneous in the particle direction of propagation , diffraction radiation is generated . in that case , the image configuration is time dependent and the system is equivalent to a set of oscillating charges in the particle reference frame .",
    "diffraction radiation can be understood as being generated by the reflection of the boosted static field on the nearby wall .",
    "we now compute the radiated power in the presence of a brane with typical longitudinal perturbations of length scale @xmath30 and transverse perturbations of length scale @xmath31 .",
    "these perturbations are modeled with a @xmath30-periodic lamellar grating with rulings of width @xmath32 perpendicular to the particle direction of motion as in fig.[braneworld3 ] .",
    "( the smith - purcell effect for a single grating with these characteristics has been discussed in ref .",
    "although this model is clearly an oversimplification , its main features do not depend on the choice of the perturbation structure : the existence of diffraction radiation is due to the excitation of propagating modes by evanescent waves and is independent of the particular mechanism by which the propagating modes are excited .     with length @xmath30 .",

    "the general solution for the field @xmath17 in the bulk is the sum of the inhomogeneous solution of the above equation plus a superposition of plane wave solutions of the two - dimensional helmholtz equation : @xmath36e^{i\\alpha_n x}\\right\\}\\ , , \\label{phi}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 . since the parameter @xmath40^{1/2}$ ] is pure imaginary , the first term in eq .",

    "this evanescent wave is the non - propagating part of the spectrum due to the particle in uniform motion .",
    "the second term in eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) represents a superposition of propagating plane waves .",
    "the physical interpretation of these propagating modes is that of radiation arising from the modes of the brane perturbations , which are excited by the evanescent waves . the amplitude @xmath41 of the gdr is thus expected to be of the order of the amplitude of the non - propagating modes , i.e. , @xmath42 where we have taken the relativistic limit @xmath43",
    "this can be shown by computing the amplitudes of the radiating modes as function of the evanescent wave amplitude @xmath44 .",

    "is related to the four - dimensional newton constant @xmath68 by @xmath69 .",
    "there are two natural length scales , the planck length , @xmath70 cm , and the size of the large extra dimensions , @xmath71 cm .",

    "upper bounds on @xmath77 range from @xmath78 for @xmath79 to @xmath80 for @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , gdr implies that the brane must be smooth on scales of order of the size of the large extra dimensions , i.e. , on scales much larger than the planck length .",
    "this fact has important consequences for the problem of initial conditions in models of brane cosmology .",
    "( see , e.g , ref .",
    "in higher - dimensional models of our universe , particles radiate gravitational waves due to the structure of the extra dimensions , specifically the presence of an inhomogeneous hidden brane .",
    "we have called this phenomenon  gravitational diffraction radiation \" because of its similarity with the electromagnetic diffraction radiation which is emitted by a charge moving near a metallic grating .",
    "gdr is a general phenomenon of all higher - dimensional braneworld scenarios .",
    "it applies to particles propagating both on the brane and in the bulk . as an example of its physical effects",
    ", we have discussed the gdr emitted by a particle on the visible brane and derived lower bounds on the scale of brane perturbations .",
    "the above results can be extended in several directions .",
    "for instance , this paper considers only inhomogeneities on the hidden brane .",
    "the visible brane is also inhomogeneous .",
    "therefore , free motion on the visible brane is not uniform from the five - dimensional perspective .",
    "this effect could be comparable to the gdr effect studied here .",
    "the derivation of gdr presented above is purely classical .",
    "although the scale of brane inhomogeneities suggests that the system can be treated as classical , the importance of quantum effects should be assessed .",
    "it would also be interesting to consider gdr emitted by photons or bulk particles . in the latter case ,",
    "gdr energy loss would manifest itself as a background of stochastic gravitational waves on the visible brane .",
    "gdr is originated by the lumpiness of the spacetime at small scales .",
    "thus gdr effects may show up in a variety of physical situations besides braneworld models .",
    "emission of radiation by free particles in a cosmic string background was discussed in ref .",
    "gdr could also play an important role in the very early universe or near the horizon of black holes .",
    "direct signatures are unlikely to be observed in these cases .",
    "however , gdr emission could lead to interesting predictions at theoretical level and possibly indirect observable effects .",
