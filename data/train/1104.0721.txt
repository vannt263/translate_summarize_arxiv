    "there is now substantial experimental@xcite and numerical@xcite evidence that a combination of frustration and low spin moments is the mechanism that produces novel quantum spin liquid phases in highly frustrated magnets ( hfms ) .",
    "it is not obvious , however , why this should be true . on the kagome lattice , large-@xmath1 spin models can exhibit order - by - disorder by quantum fluctuations at leading order in the semi - classical large @xmath2 limit@xcite .",
    "this induced order relieves the frustration of these `` spins '' and places them on similar grounds with unfrustrated ones at smaller @xmath2 .",
    "so , given the evidence for disordered spin liquid phases , the order - by - disorder phenomena must be much more delicate for ordinary su(2 ) spins .",
    "such a conclusion is further backed up by heroic efforts to compute high order large - s expansions@xcite . to address the mechanism that produces these new spin liquid phases",
    "then we need a description of these materials that does not begin by relieving the frustration and/or relying on the dominance of order - by - disorder .    to understand the connection between frustration understood at the classical level and the novel phases observed at low spin moments , one way to proceed would be to construct a semi - classical approximation that is still capable of describing non - ordered phases at smaller @xmath3",
    ". such a description would be similar to the quantum melting of an antiferromagnetic phase due to order parameter fluctuations@xcite only the dimension of the `` order parameter '' manifold , which are the classical ground states , would be larger , even growing with the size of the system in the highly frustrated case . at present , we know some features of this description . similar to the distinctions between even , odd and half odd integer spins@xcite in square lattice antiferromagnets , tunneling processes between classical ground states of kagome antiferromagnets leads to distinctions between integer and half odd integer spins@xcite .",
    "however , it is unclear at present how these tunneling processes and other fluctuations produce a spin liquid phase at smaller spin moments .    to make progress on such a semi - classical description of hfms , here i study , using dirac s `` generalized hamiltonian mechanics''@xcite , the `` dynamics '' of spins constrained to their ground state configurations . by counting the number of canonical coordinates needed to parametrize this surface ,",
    "i show that it is a null surface for the poisson bracket much like the light cone is a null surface in minkowsky spacetime ( see ch . 2 of @xcite ) . in simpler terms",
    ", this means that the number of canonical coordinates of the constrained phase space is not equal to its dimension .",
    "some coordinates are redundant non - canonical coordiantes . according to the dirac method ,",
    "this implies the constrained spin model has gauge dynamics .",
    "in particular , for the case of periodic boundary conditions , i find that the surface whose dimension is well known to grow with the system size@xcite has no canonical coordinates .",
    "for open boundary conditions , i find that this number depends on the existence of `` dangling triangles '' on the boundary of the kagome cluster and at best grows with its circumference .",
    "the constrained spin kagome model is therefore much like a `` doubled '' version of topological chern - simons electrodynamics characteristic of a @xmath0 spin liquid state@xcite .",
    "however , it does not require longer ranged interactions to construct as in the levin and wen models@xcite .",
    "this approach generalizes easily to other hfms though the counting of canonical coordinates is likely different in other cases with , for example , the number likely growing with the volume of the system on the pyrochlore lattice",
    ". we will conclude with a discussion of the implication of these results for the ordinary unconstrained heisenberg model and for more realistic models subject to various perturbations .",
    "in a highly frustrated magnet(hfm ) , spins are frustrated because they have many options to choose from and are unable to decide which is best . on the kagome lattice shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kag ] , the classical ground states of the nearest neighbor heisenberg model prefer a vanishing total spin on each triangle@xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 are the three components of the classical spin unit vector @xmath7 on site @xmath8 and the three sites @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 form any triangle on the lattice .",
    "this may happen in many materials including herbersmithite , the jarosite family , srcr@xmath11g@xmath12o@xmath13 and na@xmath14ir@xmath15o@xmath16 .",
    "spins `` suffering '' this condition are highly frustrated for they have difficulty deciding between the continuously many arrangements that satisfy it .",
    "such arrangements are described by the `` spin origami '' construction@xcite of drawing spin vectors on a piece of paper and literally folding the paper to obtain new spin directions ( see below ) .",
    "the resulting behavior of the spins is then collective and at finite temperatures , they enter a `` cooperative '' paramagnetic phase@xcite . furthermore , there is a wide class of other hfms with similar constraints@xcite such as the pyrochlore antiferromagnets where the analog of the spin origami construction leads to an effective maxwell - like gauge description and dipolar spin correlations@xcite . because of their novel low energy properties due to such constrained mechanical behavior , hfms continue to be promising materials@xcite to search for new phases of matter .",
    "in essence the origami sheet construction gives us an intuitive representation of the kagome ground state spin configurations .",
    "it is a duality transformation to a set of height vectors @xmath17 that live on the triangular lattice formed by the hexagons of the kagome lattice .",
    "these vectors are defined through the single spin shared by two neighboring hexagons and are directly analogous to displacement vectors of a two - dimensional solid membrane in three - dimensional space .",
    "specifically , the mapping between height vectors and spin vectors is @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the two hexagons that share the spin @xmath8 .",

    "a complete basis of tangent vectors can then be constructed by finding all vectors @xmath129 perpendicular to @xmath127 and adding as many of them to the set @xmath130 as we can to obtain a set @xmath131 that forms a basis of the tangent space at the point @xmath120 .",
    "as stated , the vector @xmath132 points along a gauge orbit ; the other @xmath129 vectors then point along `` physical '' directions . to see this ,",
    "consider the equation of motion for any phase space observable @xmath133 letting @xmath134 , as discussed in section [ subsec : counting ] , we obtain @xmath135 where @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "so @xmath132 is directly associated with the arbitrary lagrange multiplier function @xmath114 and any observable @xmath138 with @xmath139 perpendicular to @xmath132 evolves in time independent of this @xmath114 .",
    "now suppose @xmath138 was the phase space coordinate @xmath140 and we evolve it in time starting from a given initial conditions @xmath141 under two different choices of @xmath142 and @xmath143 . at an infinitesimal time @xmath144",
    "later , the two new points @xmath145 and @xmath146 are related by @xmath147 where @xmath148 is just the component of @xmath132 along the @xmath140 direction in phase space . so performing this same calculation for the other coordinates",
    ", we see that nearby physically equivalent points in phase space are connected by the vector @xmath132 and path from one of these points to the other is an unphysical gauge orbit .",
    "the remaining tangent vectors @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 that are linearly independent from @xmath132 then point along directions that can not be related by a change in @xmath114 .",
    "lets now apply this vector analysis to show that trajectories unrelated by a change in @xmath114 necessarily involve the motion of spins on more than one dangling triangle . to this end",
    ", we need to show that all linear combinations of @xmath149 , @xmath150 etc . , move spins on more than one dangling triangle . for a given dangling triangle ,",
    "we then need only define a set of vectors @xmath152 corresponding to the @xmath153 or @xmath154 coordinate of a bulk spin or a spin on our chosen dangling triangle and show that the set @xmath155 is linearly independent . for the case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nc ] , the linear independence of this set was found to be true for each dangling triangle .",
    "hence , the canonical modes , as expected from the inability to assign both a position and momentum variable to the spins on a given dangling triangle , are non - local and necessarily involve the motion of spins on more than one dangling triangle .",
    "it is useful to use the spin origami sheet construction to visualize the orbits defined by a tangent vector @xmath129 .",
    "using this vector , we can construct a small orbit by @xmath156 , @xmath157 . here",
    "@xmath158 is a point in the unconstrained phase space .",
    "this orbit essentially moves a small distance away from @xmath159 and shows how physical modes evolve in time in a given gauge . to see how this affects the spins , it is then straightforward to map @xmath160 to the set of spin vectors @xmath161 .",
    "it is not easy to understand the collective behavior by directly observing individual spin vectors so lets pass to the spin origami construction for visualization purposes .",
    "the result is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : nc ] b - d and movies of them are available online in the supplementary materials .",
    "the motion of multiple dangling triangles ( that have white or blue bonds ) is apparent in both the movie and in fig .",
    "[ fig : nc](b)-(d ) .",
    "in summary using the dirac approach , i found that the number of canonical coordinates @xmath41 , unlike the @xmath162 coordinates given by maxwell counting , is the same on all the intersecting surfaces characterized by folding patterns that make up the constrained phase space .",
    "in addition , this @xmath41 vanishes on any cluster with periodic boundary conditions and grows with the number of dangling triangles on clusters with open boundary conditions .",
    "the remarkable simplicity of this result allows us to make connections both with known results for the quantum heisenberg model and for systems whose hamiltonian is perturbed away from the nearest neighbor model .",
    "the results for @xmath41 here are very similar to doubled chern - simons electrodynamics expected to describe @xmath0 spin liquids@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 spin liquid picture recently gained greater acceptance through dmrg calculations showing a gap to all bulk excitations@xcite and entanglement entropy calculations consistent with a topological @xmath0 spin liquid@xcite .",
    "this suggests that even spin @xmath163 spins may know about the classical constrained phase space that forms the focus of this paper !",
    "the canonical degree of freedom counting also has implications for realistic hamiltonians of the form @xmath164 where @xmath165 are quantum spin operators , the first term is the nearest neighbor exchange and the second , characterized by an energy scale @xmath166 that is much smaller than @xmath167 , represents all other perturbations , including further neighbor exchange , dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions , ring exchange and impurities . in the limit @xmath168 ,",
    "the perturbations would induce a hamiltonian for the constrained phase space with energy scale @xmath166 .",
    "likely this induced hamiltonian would lead to so - called `` secondary constraints '' and freeze the spins into a single pattern , their ground state . for finite @xmath167 ,",
    "however , where both gauge and canonical modes are `` physical modes '' , the perturbing hamiltonian would lift the degeneracy of these zero modes giving them dispersion .",
    "however , because these modes transform differently under gauge transformations in the constrained model , they should remain as two distinct types of modes .",
    "the low energy sector is then spanned by two kinds of zero - modes ( the gauge and canonical modes of the constrained phase space ) and a third mode involving fluctuations outside of the constrained space such as the `` monopoles '' of ref .",

    "it is well known that electromagnetic waves are transverse with only two polarizations . viewed as a hamiltonian mechanical system",
    ", each polarization mode should consist of a position and momentum variable for each point in space .",
    "this means that electrodynamics has four canonical degrees of freedom per point in space .",
    "however , in the lagrangian view of electrodyamics ( without source terms ) , the action @xmath169 with @xmath170 is described in terms of four fields @xmath171 , the scalar and vector potentials . for each `` position '' field",
    "@xmath172 there should be a `` velocity '' field @xmath173 making a total of 8 degrees of freedom per point in space . from this perspective , it is not obvious that there are two polarizations of light .",
    "lets show this by passing to the hamiltonian formalism .",
    "a discussion along these lines is also available in ref .",
    "@xcite but here i present it in the language of the main body of this paper to facility an understanding of the calculations leading to its main result that @xmath75 in the bulk of the kagome constrained spin model .    to construct a hamiltonian , we first need to find the momentum fields @xmath174 .",
    "they are @xmath175 the time component of this equation , @xmath176 is a phase space constraint , for it does not relate the momentum variable @xmath177 to any velocity variables @xmath178 .",

    "this means that gauss s law @xmath180 is also a phase space constraint for it is only a relationship between the momentum densities @xmath181 .",
    "so , the constrained phase space is parametrized by the eight variables @xmath182 and @xmath172 subject to the two constraints @xmath183 and @xmath184 .    to find the number of physical degrees of freedom per point in space , @xmath55 , the approach used in the main text is to work in the unconstrained phase space using lagrange multipliers .",
    "then @xmath55 per point in space is given by @xmath185 where @xmath186 is the number of unconstrained degrees of freedom , @xmath187 is the number of constraint functions and @xmath115 the number of arbitrary lagrange multipliers not fixed by the requirement to remain in the constrained phase space .",

    "hence @xmath196 per point in space and as discussed above these four degrees of freedom correspond to the two polarizations of light .",
    "abelian chern - simon s theory is formally very similar to electrodynamics in two spatial and one time dimension .",
    "maxwell electrodynamics in this two - dimensional case would still have a lagrangian density @xmath197 , just @xmath198 does not include the @xmath199-direction .",
    "however , with only two spatial dimensions , the action @xmath200 is also allowed .",
    "notice it does not involve the `` metric tensor '' @xmath201 but instead only the antisymmetric tensor @xmath202 .",
    "this is a hint that space - time distance , defined by @xmath203 , may not be important in computing this action but that it may only depend on the topology of the space it is integrating over .",
    "it is therefore an interesting alternative to electrodynamics that can arise in a lower dimensional setting .    to count the physical degrees of freedom of chern - simons electrodynamics , let us again pass to the hamiltonian formalism using the language of the main text .",
    "see also ref .",
    "the unconstrained phase space has @xmath59 degrees of freedom per point in space with the three momentum variables @xmath204 because none of these three equations involve the velocity variables @xmath178 they are all phase space constraints .",
    "let us define these constraints through the functions @xmath205 so we have three constraints @xmath206 from the definition of the momentum variables .",
    "to see if there are any other constraints , we need to look at the equations of motion .",
    "they turn out to be the three equations @xmath207 so that there are no electric or magnetic fields .",
    "one of these equations , @xmath208 , does not involve any time evolution .",
    "it is therefore also a constraint .    in total",
    "then , we have @xmath209 constraints , @xmath210 and @xmath211 . because there are no electric and magnetic fields , the hamiltonian @xmath212 vanishes .",

    "given the two arbitrary lagrange multiplier functions @xmath224 and @xmath225 we have @xmath226 per point in space . hence , the number of canonical degrees of freedom per point in space is @xmath227 .",

    "using the language of this paper , i will show how similar in structure this model is to the kagome constrained spin model discussed in the main text .",
    "@xcite considers the mechanics of charged particles subject to an external magnetic field in two dimensions ( inspired by the fractional quantum hall effect ) . in the circular gauge ,",
    "the lagrangian of such particles is @xmath228 in the fractional quantum hall effect , the important limit of the above model is that of very large magnetic fields @xmath229 . as such , the authors consider the limit @xmath230 . after taking this limit , the lagrangian is linear in @xmath231 and the conjugate momenta are @xmath232 so there is no relationship between the momenta and the velocities . in passing to the hamiltonian formalism , these @xmath187 equations are the constraints @xmath233 in the @xmath234 dimensional unconstrained phase space and the hamiltonian is @xmath235 .",
    "we can work in this phase space by introducing lagrange multipliers through @xmath236 and imposing @xmath237 where summation over @xmath9 is implied .",

    "this system is not a gauge system .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom , all of which are canonical , is @xmath240 .",
    "the focus of the paper , however , is not directly on this model but on the extension of this model to include an additional constraint , that of fixed angular momentum .",
    "this alternative model is described by the lagrangian @xmath241 where @xmath242 is a parameter and @xmath99 is a lagrange multiplier that enforces a third constraint @xmath243 so that this system has @xmath60 .",
    "this fixes the angular momentum @xmath167 because after imposing @xmath244 and @xmath245 , @xmath246 .",
    "following the previous discussion on fixing the lagrange multipliers , we construct the constraint matrix @xmath247 , @xmath248 and obtain @xmath249 this matrix has eigenvalues @xmath219 , @xmath250 and the length of the eigenvector that corresponds to the zero eigenvalue @xmath251 is arbitrary .",
