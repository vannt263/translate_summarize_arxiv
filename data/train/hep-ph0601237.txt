    "it is well known that the tree - level couplings of the lightest minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) higgs boson ( @xmath2 ) to fermion pairs and gauge bosons tend to their standard model ( sm ) values in the decoupling limit , @xmath3 @xcite . as a consequence of this decoupling , distinguishing the lightest mssm higgs boson in the large @xmath4 limit from the higgs boson of the sm",
    "will be very difficult .",
    "our aim is to determine the nature of the decoupling limit at one - loop for the couplings of @xmath2 to sm particles .",
    "if some non - decoupling behavior of supersymmetric ( susy ) particles is found , it will provide a clear signal for some low energy observables , even if @xmath5 .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the @xmath2 coupling to @xmath6 .",
    "this coupling determines the partial width of @xmath7 , which is by far the dominant decay mode of @xmath2 in most of the mssm parameter space .",
    "therefore , accurate knowledge of the @xmath8 coupling is very important for higgs boson searches . in particular , we study the @xmath1 yukawa coupling mssm radiative corrections to the @xmath8 vertex at one loop level , and we explore their behavior in the decoupling limit . a detailed discussion of the susy - qcd corrections that arise from gluino and bottom - squark ( sbottom ) exchange have been previously given in  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that in the decoupling limit of both large susy mass parameters and large cp - odd higgs mass , the @xmath9 decay width approaches its sm value at one loop , with the onset of decoupling delayed for large @xmath10 values . however",
    ", this decoupling does not occur if just the susy mass parameters are taken large .",
    "the full diagrammatic formula for the on - shell ew ( electroweak)-yukawa corrections to the @xmath8 coupling will be presented in  @xcite .",
    "here we summarized the results obtained in this paper . in section  [ sec : masses ] we briefly review the decoupling limit in the higgs sector and the susy sector of the mssm .",
    "the @xmath1 yukawa corrections to the @xmath8 coupling are presented in section  [ sec : renormalization ] .",
    "some details of the renormalization procedure and a discussion of the decoupling properties of these corrections are included in this section .",
    "analytical and numerical results are collected in section  [ sec : analytic ] .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the properties of the mssm higgs sector at the tree - level are determined by just two free parameters , conventionally chosen as the mass of the cp - odd neutral higgs boson ( @xmath11 ) , @xmath4 , and the ratio of the vacuum expectation values ( _ _ vev__s ) of each doublet , @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "the decoupling limit in the mssm is defined by considering the parameter regime where @xmath13 . in this limit , the expressions for the higgs masses and mixing angle simplify  @xcite and two consequences are immediately apparent .",
    "first , @xmath14 , up to corrections of @xmath15 , and @xmath16 . second , @xmath17 up to corrections of @xmath18 .",
    "consequently , the effective higgs sector consists only of one light cp - even higgs boson , @xmath2 , whose couplings to sm particles are indistinguishable from those of the sm higgs boson .",
    "when radiative corrections to the cp - even higgs mass - squared matrix are taken into account , the upper bound on @xmath19 increases substantially to @xmath20 gev  @xcite .    summarizing the parameters of the squark sector ,",
    "the tree - level squark squared - mass matrix is : @xmath21 with ,    m_l_q^2 & = & m_q^2 + m_q^2 + 2m_z^2 ( t_3^q - q_q s_w^2 ) + m_r_q^2 & = & m_u , d^2 + m_q^2 + 2m_z^2 q_q s_w^2 + x_t & = & a_t- , x_b = a_b- , [ eq : sbottomparams ]    and @xmath22 .",
    "the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the soft - susy - breaking masses , @xmath25 is a soft - susy - breaking trilinear coupling and @xmath26 is the bilinear coupling of the two higgs doublet superfields .    in order to get heavy squarks , we need to choose large values for the appropriate soft susy breaking parameters and the @xmath26-parameter . since we are interested here in the limiting situation where the whole susy spectrum is heavier than the electroweak scale , we have made the following assumptions ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) ,    m_,u , d ~m_g ~~a_t , b ~m_susym_z , [ eq : limitq ]    where @xmath27 represents generically a common large susy mass scale .",
    "in addition , we have considered two extreme cases , maximal and minimal mixing , which imply certain constraints on the squark mass differences : a. close to maximal mixing ( @xmath28 ) : @xmath29 ) : @xmath30 .",
    "( [ eq : limitq ] ) also implies that the gluino is heavy .",
    "finally , the chargino mass matrix is given by ,    m_^= (    cc m_2 & m_w + m_w &    ) ,    and in order to get heavy charginos we consider the limit : @xmath31 .",
    "here we present the one - loop corrections to the partial decay width @xmath34 .",
    "we will then explore the decoupling behavior of these corrections for large susy masses , @xmath27 , and/or large @xmath4 .",
    "both numerical and analytical results will be presented elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the tree - level @xmath8 coupling is given by @xmath35 in lowest order this higgs - fermion vertex represents the yukawa coupling proportional to the fermion mass @xmath36 .",
    "note that in the limit of large @xmath4 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 tends to the sm coupling , @xmath39 .",
    "the vertex functions obtained from the set of one - loop diagrams are in general uv - divergent . for finite one - particle irreducible ( 1pi )",
    "green functions and physical observables , renormalization has to be performed by adding appropriate counterterms .",
    "we follow the conventions given in  @xcite for the renormalization procedure .      the radiatively - corrected @xmath8 coupling depends on the mixing angle @xmath41 . at tree - level , @xmath41 is determined by fixing @xmath10 and @xmath4 . at one - loop order , there are no @xmath42 corrections to this mixing angle  @xcite .",
    "however , once one - loop susy - ew effects are included , the one - loop radiative corrections to @xmath41 must be taken into account  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the dominant contributions to the higgs boson self - energies can be obtained by setting @xmath43 .",
    "consequently , these corrections can be absorbed into a redefinition of the cp - even neutral higgs mixing angle @xmath41 .",
    "this is the so - called @xmath44-approximation .",
    "more explicitly , we approximate the renormalized higgs boson self - energies by @xmath45 . consequently , the correction to the mixing angle , @xmath46 , is related to the renormalized self - energies and masses .",
    "neglecting terms beyond one - loop level , one obtains @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the renormalized @xmath2@xmath49 mixing propagator given in  @xcite .",
    "we can then absorb the contributions to the @xmath2@xmath49 mixing , due to the squarks / chargino loops , in the redefinition of the effective mixing angle @xmath41 . in this approximation one",
    "deduces that @xmath50 .      in this section",
    "we present explicit results for the @xmath51 ew - yukawa correction to the @xmath8 vertex .",
    "the leading yukawa contribution to the @xmath52 coupling arises from diagrams involving the exchange of virtual top - squarks , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fd ] .    at the one - loop level and @xmath51 ,",
    "the @xmath52 coupling can be written as , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the one - loop partial width and @xmath55 is the tree - level partial width as in  ( [ eq.hbbtree ] ) .",
    "@xmath56 denotes the @xmath51 radiative corrections to this vertex as given in fig .",
    "[ fig : fd ] , @xmath57 the triangle diagram , with the exchange of stops and charginos , contributes to @xmath58 , whereas the bottom self - energy diagram contributes to the contribution of the counterterms , @xmath59 .",
    "we have checked that other triangle contributions ( with one top - squark and two charginos ) and neutralinos contributions are subleading diagrams ; hence , these diagrams are not included here .",
    "note that our results are in agreement with the corresponding results of  @xcite .",
    "expansions in inverse powers of susy masses are performed in order to examine the decoupling behavior when the susy masses are large compared to @xmath60 .",
    "concretely , we perform expansions of the loop integrals and mixing angles for @xmath61 and isolate terms of @xmath62 . thus , by defining @xmath63 and including the leading @xmath64 terms ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath65 ) in the expansion , , we obtain the following result for the maximal mixing case , @xmath66 :    & & = m_t^2 + & & \\ { ( + ) f_1(r ) + o ( ) } , + [ eq : amalitical ]    where the functions @xmath67 are defined in ref .",
    "@xcite and have been normalized as @xmath68 .",
    "notice that the first term in  ( [ eq : amalitical ] ) is the dominant one in the limit of large @xmath27 [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : limitq ] ) ] and does not vanish in the asymptotic limit of infinitely large @xmath69 , @xmath26 and @xmath25 .",
    "therefore this term gives a non - decoupling susy contribution to the @xmath70 partial width which can be of phenomenological interest .",
    "moreover , since this term is enhanced at large @xmath71 it can provide important corrections to the @xmath72 total width , even for a very heavy susy spectrum .",
    "the sign of these corrections are fixed by the sign of @xmath73 .",
    "we find similar results for the minimal mixing case , @xmath74  @xcite .    from this result",
    ", we conclude that there is no decoupling of stops and charginos in the limit of large susy mass parameters for fixed @xmath4 .",
    "similar results have been found for the susy - qcd corrections  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , most numerical studies done so far on this subject indicate decoupling of heavy susy particles from sm physics . how do we then recover decoupling of the heavy mssm spectra from the sm low energy physics ?",
    "the answer to this question relies in the fact that in order to converge to sm predictions we need to consider not just a heavy susy spectra but also a heavy higgs sector .",
    "that is , besides large @xmath27 , the condition of large @xmath4 is also needed .",
    "thus , if @xmath3 , one can easily derive : @xmath75 by substituting this into  ( [ eq : amalitical ] ) we see that the non - decoupling terms cancel out and we end up with    & & _ susyew = m_t^2 + & & \\ { f_1(r ) 2 + o ( ) } +    which clearly vanishes in the asymptotic limit of @xmath76 and @xmath77 . therefore , we get decoupling if and only if both @xmath76 and @xmath78 are large .",
    "the above non - decoupling behavior is shown numerically in figs .",
    "[ fig : msma ] and  [ fig : mams ] for @xmath79 and susy parameters as defined in  ( [ eq : limitq ] ) .",
    "we show the dependence of @xmath56 on @xmath27 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : msma ] ) and @xmath4 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mams ] ) .",
    "clearly , in the limit of large @xmath27 , @xmath56 tends to a non - vanishing constant , and this constant tends to zero in the large @xmath4 limit .",
    "similarly , in the limit of large @xmath4 , @xmath56 tends to a non - vanishing constant , and this constant tends to zero in the large @xmath27 limit .",
    "the solid lines in these figures correspond to the exact computation of the squarks / chargino loops , and the dashed lines correspond to the results of the expansion as in  ( [ eq : amalitical ] ) .",
    "note that we have just considered the leading @xmath64 term in the expansion .",
    "the agreement between the exact results and the approximation derived from the expansion is recovered when the second term in the expansion is included .",
    "[ fig : msma ]    [ fig : mams ]    the non - decoupling behavior emerging when the susy mass scale is much larger than @xmath4 , can be derived from the low - energy effective theory that is obtained by integrating out the susy particles .",
    "this low - energy effective theory contains two higgs doublets , whose couplings to fermions are unrestricted ( _ i.e. _ , each higgs doublet couples to _ both _ up - type and down - type quarks ) , characteristic of the so - called general type - iii two higgs doublet model instead of the type - ii model that is assumed in the mssm with no radiative corrections included  @xcite .",
    "the fact that decoupling is recovered when all susy mass parameters and @xmath4 are equal is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dec ] .",
    "the @xmath80 corrections are plotted as a function of a common scale @xmath81 for different values of @xmath82 .",
    "clearly , @xmath56 decouples , but this decoupling is delayed at large @xmath10 . for example , even at @xmath83  tev , @xmath84% for @xmath85 .",
    "the corrections can be @xmath86% for @xmath87 and @xmath88  gev .",

    "in this paper we have studied the @xmath51 one loop yukawa corrections to the @xmath8 coupling , coming from diagrams involving the exchange of virtual stops and charginos , in the limit of large susy masses .",
    "we have performed expansions for the susy mass parameters large compared to the electroweak scale .",
    "we demonstrate that in the limit of large @xmath4 and large susy mass parameters , the corrections decouple like the inverse square of these mass parameters , and the sm expression for the @xmath89 one - loop coupling is recovered .",
    "that is , the ew - yukawa corrections to the @xmath8 coupling decouple in the limit of large susy masses and large @xmath4 .",
    "however , if the mass parameters are not all of the same size , then the decoupling behavior can be modified . if @xmath4 is light , then the corrections to the @xmath8 coupling generically do not decouple in the limit of large susy mass parameters .",
    "the decoupling behavior of the radiative corrections to the @xmath8 coupling implies that distinguishing @xmath2 from the sm higgs boson will be very difficult if @xmath11 and the susy spectrum are heavy , even after one - loop susy corrections are taken into account .",
    "however , because of the enhancement at large @xmath10 , the onset of decoupling is delayed , and the corrections can still be at the percent level for @xmath90 and all susy mass parameters and @xmath4 of order 1 tev . such effects could be detected in precision higgs studies and provide a critical window to the tev - scale .",
