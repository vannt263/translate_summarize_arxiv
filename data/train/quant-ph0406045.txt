    "for a 1d static detector located in the spatial interval @xmath0 $ ] ( see figure [ 1drid ] ) , the _ average dwell time _ of an ensemble of quantum systems with wave function @xmath1 from time @xmath2 up to time @xmath3 is generally agreed to be given by @xmath4 cf the reviews @xcite .",
    "it is motivated by classical reasoning @xcite , and it also has been derived within bohmian mechanics @xcite . in a recent work",
    "@xcite a corresponding dwell time operator has been investigated .",
    "dwell times of the type ( [ 1ddwelltime ] ) were associated with interaction times in collision processes long ago @xcite .",
    "the relevance of these interaction times to time resolved scattering experiments has been studied , e.g. , in @xcite . through these works",
    "it became clear , that _ differences _ of average dwell times formed between a scattering wave packet and its free incoming asymptote are measurable quantities .    with the introduction of the larmor clock by baz @xcite , dwell",
    "time expressions themselves have got measurable status .",
    "the idea is that a small and uniform magnetic field , which is confined to a small region of space , causes a larmor - precession of the spin - polarization vector of the scattered wave .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the larmor clock indeed reveals the average dwell time .",
    "if it also is capable of displaying the spectral distribution of some dwell time operator is still unclear .",
    "the specialization of the larmor clock to the case of one - dimensional scattering was done by rybachenko in @xcite . in this work ( to the authors knowledge for the first time ) a distinction into the dwell times of the finally transmitted respectively reflected partial waves has been introduced . for short such selective dwell times will further on be denoted as transmission and reflection times .",
    "another approach to transmission and reflection times , grounded on a specific experimental scheme , was introduced by the oscillating barrier model of bttiker and landauer @xcite .",
    "this model is widely believed to have ignited the tunnelling time controversy anew .",
    "a further extension of the larmor clock by bttiker @xcite incorporates the effect of spin - alignment with the magnetic field .",
    "more recently the interest in transmission times has been driven on the one hand by the very indirect time measurement techniques of the condensed matter community , especially in connection with tunnelling in semiconductor heterostructures or josephson junctions .",
    "on the other hand , the progress in laser cooling techniques in quantum optics delivers another valuable tool for future time resolved scattering experiments .",
    "it is no surprise that the detailed definition of transmission and reflection times depends on the situation under scrutiny .",
    "a systematic operator approach embodying several such possible definitions was given by brouard _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "it was shown , however , that transmission and reflection times derived within the framework of bohmian mechanics are not included in this catalogue ( @xcite , chapter 5 ) .",
    "bohmian mechanics comprises the mathematical concept of world lines or trajectories and with this the term ` particle ' obtains substance in quantum theory again .",
    "thus the notion of dwell time can be addressed in a straightforward manner , very much like in classical mechanics .",
    "the dwell time of a particle in the spatial interval @xmath0 $ ] is simply defined as the duration during which the particle s trajectory is localized within @xmath0 $ ] . for an elaborate discussion of bohmian mechanics see @xcite .",
    "as the numerical effort involved with the calculation of bohmian world lines is immense , there have been attempts to compute the bohmian transmission and reflection times without the sampling of trajectories .",
    "a related one - dimensional bound - state situation has , e.g. , been studied by stomphorst in @xcite . in the present paper a formulation without trajectories for the transmission and reflection times in a genuine scattering situation",
    "is presented .",
    "the derivation closely follows ideas developed for the treatment of 1d arrival time in @xcite . as an application the scattering from a double potential barrier , reminiscent of semiconductor - heterojunctions in ,",
    "e.g. , resonant tunnelling diodes , is considered .",
    "we consider a scattering situation in which the mller operators @xmath5 and @xmath6 exist and are asymptotically complete @xcite .",
    "@xmath7 denotes the scattering solution with incoming asymptote @xmath8 . the solution @xmath9 of the free schrdinger equation is chosen to be localized on the negative spatial semi - axis for @xmath10 .",
    "that is the case if and only if the fourier transform @xmath11 is localized on the positive half - line @xcite .    the bohmian transmission time in the above scattering situation is defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath12 denote the bohmian trajectory which at time @xmath13 passes through the point @xmath14 .",
    "there exists a critical value @xmath15 , such that @xmath16 for all @xmath17 and that @xmath18 for all @xmath19 . therefore the bohmian transmission time",
    "is defined as @xmath20}(\\gamma_x(t))\\ ] ] with @xmath21}$ ] the characteristic function on the interval @xmath0 $ ] and @xmath22 the heaviside step function .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "analogously the reflection time @xmath23 is defined by replacing the term @xmath24 in the right hand side of equation ( [ transt ] ) by @xmath25 .",
    "the critical trajectory @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) is implicitly defined by @xmath28 thereby @xmath29 is the transmission probability of the scattering system .",
    "the lower limit of the integral in ( [ transkoeff ] ) can equally be replaced by any finite @xmath30 .",
    "accordingly by @xmath31 , the reflection probability is defined .",
    "thus the conditional transmission respectively reflection times , i.e. transmission and reflection times normalized to the fraction of transmitted respectively reflected particles of the entire ensemble , are @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "\\times [ { \\ensuremath{\\tau_{i}}},{\\ensuremath{\\tau_{f}}}]$].[1drid],title=\"fig : \" ] +    from the computational viewpoint , the two terms @xmath34 and @xmath23 by means of bohmian mechanics are achieved in a straightforward manner .",
    "one chooses an appropriate sample of initial values on the configuration space @xmath35 , calculates the corresponding trajectories over a sufficient range of time , determines the dwell time for each trajectory , labels the trajectories as transmitted or reflected according to their position at large times and finally calculates , according to the weight of each trajectory and just as in classical statistics , the average times .",
    "that this programm involves formidable numerical effort is evident .",
    "however , the calculation of bohmian transmission and reflection times can be reduced to the computation of current density integrals along the edges at @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",

    "obviously an interesting task would be to construct a device , i.e. a clock , which measures the bohmian transmission and reflection times .",
    "such a clock should display the respective time , let us say , through the bohmian center of mass position of its hand at the instant of its readout , which presumably has to be chosen by the experimenter .",
    "the combined system s wave function would be modelled by an appropriate schrdinger equation , incorporating the interaction between the micro - system and the clock .",
    "there is a self - adjoint operator corresponding to the hand s positions .",
    "the crucial question is whether this observable s spectral distribution in a given state at the instant of its readout coincides with the respective bohmian transmission ( reflection ) time distribution .",
    "probably this is not the case for all states .",
    "however , similarly to the issue of exit time statistics @xcite , a subspace might be identified on which the bohmian distribution coincides with one of the standard quantum mechanical distributions .",
