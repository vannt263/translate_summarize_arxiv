    "delay is a generic problem in the control of chaotic systems .",
    "the effective delay time @xmath0 in any feedback loop is the sum of at least three delay times , the duration of measurement , the time needed to compute the appropriate control amplitude , and the response time of the system to the applied control .",
    "the latter effect appears especially when the applied control additionally has to propagate through the system .",
    "these response time may extend to one or more cycle lengths @xcite .",
    "for the formal situation of fixed point stabilization in time - continuous control , the issue of delay has been investigated widely in control theory , dating back at least to the smith predictor @xcite .",
    "this approach mimics the , yet unknown , actual system state by a linear prediction based on the last measurement .",
    "its time - discrete counterpart ( lplc ) discussed below allows to place all eigenvalues of the associated linear dynamics to zero , and always ensures stability .",
    "the ( time - continuous ) smith predictor with its infinite - dimensional initial condition had to be refined @xcite , giving rise to the recently active fields of _ model predictive control _ @xcite .",
    "for fixed point stabilization , an extension of permissible latency has been found for a modified proportional - plus - derivative controller @xcite .",
    "if one wants to stabilize the dynamics of a chaotic system onto an unstable periodic orbit , one is in a special situation . in principle",
    ", a proper engineering approach could be to use the concept of sliding mode control @xcite , i.  e.  to use a co - moving coordinate system and perform suitable control methods within it .",
    "however , this requires the quite accurate knowledge of the whole trajectory ( and the direction of the stable manifold ) with the respective numerical or experimental costs",
    ".    therefore direct approaches have been developed by explicitely taking into account either a poincar surface of section @xcite or the explicit periodic orbit length @xcite .",
    "this field of _ controlling chaos _ , or stabilization of chaotic systems , by small perturbations , in system variables @xcite or control parameters @xcite , emerged to a widely discussed topic with applications in a broad area from technical to biological systems . especially in fast systems",
    "@xcite or for slow drift in parameters @xcite ,",
    "difference control methods have been successful , namely the time - continuous pyragas scheme @xcite , etdas @xcite , and time - discrete difference control @xcite .    like for the control method itself ,",
    "the discussion of the measurement delay problem in chaos control has to take into account the special issues of the situation : in classical control applications one always tries to keep the control loop latency as short as possible . in chaotic systems",
    "however , one wants to control a fixed point of the poincar iteration and thus has to wait until the next crossing of the poincar surface of section , where the system again is in vicinity of that fixed point .    the stability theory and",
    "the delay influence for time - continuous chaos control schemes has been studied extensively @xcite , and an improvement of control by periodic modulation has been proposed in @xcite . for measurement delays that extend to a full period , however no extension of",
    "the time - continuous pyragas scheme is available .    in this paper",
    "we investigate time - discrete control schemes and focus on the question what limitations occur if one applies ogy control @xcite or difference feedback @xcite in the presence of time delay , and what strategies can be used to overcome these limitations .",
    "we show how the measurement delay problem can be solved systematically for ogy control and difference control by rhythmic control and a memory method and give constructive direct and elegant formulas for the deadbeat control in the time - discrete poincar iteration .",
    "while the predictive control method lplc presented below for ogy control has a direct correspondence to the smith predictor and thus can be reviewed as its somehow straightforward implementation within the unstable subspace of the poincar iteration , this prediction approach does not guarantee a stable controller for difference control .",
    "however , within a class of feedback schemes linear in system parameters and system variable , there is always a unique scheme where all eigenvalues are zero , the mdc scheme presented below .",
    "the method can be applied also for more than one positive ljapunov exponent , and shows , within validity of the linearization in vicinity of the orbit , to be free of principal limitations in ljapunov exponents or delay time . for zero delay ( but the inherent 1 period delay of mdc ) , mdc has been demonstrated experimentally for a chaotic electronic circuit @xcite and a thermionic plasma discharge diode @xcite , with excellent agreement , both of stability areas and transient ljapunov exponents , to the theory presented here .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . after introducing the notation within a recall of ogy control , we give a brief summary what limitations occur for unmodified ogy control ; details can be found in @xcite . in section [ secogy ]",
    "we introduce different memory methods to improve control , of which the lplc approach appears to be superior as it allows stabilization of arbitrary fixed points for any given delay .",
    "the stabilization of unknown fixed points is discussed in section [ sec : mdc ] , where we present a memory method ( mdc ) that again allows stabilization of arbitrary unstable fixed points .",
    "as shown in appendix  [ app1 ] , for all systems with only one instable lyapunov number , the iterated dynamics can be transformed on an eigensystem which reduces to the one - dimensional case .",
    "the explicit formulas for the case of higher - dimensional subspaces are given in appendices [ app_ogy ] and [ app_diff ] .",
    "the ogy method given by ott , grebogi and yorke @xcite stabilizes unstable fixed points ( or unstable periodic orbits utilizing a poincar surface of section ) by feedback that is applied in vicinity of the fixed point @xmath1 of a discrete dynamics @xmath2 .",
    "thus , for a chaotic flow ( or corresponding experiment ) one reduces the system dynamics @xmath3 to the discrete dynamics between subsequent poincar sections at @xmath4 .",
    "this description is fundamentally different from a stroboscopic sampling as long as the system is not on a periodic orbit , where the sequence of differences @xmath5 would show a periodic structure .    if there is only one positive ljapunov exponent , we can proceed considering the motion in unstable direction only ( see appendix [ app1 ] ) , i.  e.  a one - dimensional iterated map .",
    "( for 2 or more positive ljapunov exponents on can proceed in a similar fashion , see app .",
    "[ app_ogy ] and [ app_diff ] . )    in ogy control , the control parameter @xmath6 is made time - dependent .",
    "the amplitude of the feedback @xmath7 added to the control parameter @xmath8 is proportional by a constant @xmath9 to the distance @xmath10 from the fixed point , i.  e. @xmath11 , and the feedback gain can be determined from a linearization around the fixed point , which reads , if we neglect higher order terms , @xmath12[l]{$ + r_t \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\partial { } f}{\\partial { } r}\\right)_{x^{*},r_0 } $ } \\nonumber   \\\\ & = &   \\makebox[15em][l]{$ f(x^{*},r_0)+ \\lambda ( x_t - x^{*})+\\mu r_t $ } \\nonumber   \\\\ & = &   \\makebox[15em][l]{$ f(x^{*},r_0)+ ( \\lambda + \\mu \\varepsilon)\\cdot ( x_t - x^ { * } ) $ } \\ ] ] the second expression vanishes for @xmath13 , that is , in linear approximation the system arrives at the fixed point at the next time step , @xmath14 .",
    "the uncontrolled system is assumed to be unstable in the fixed point , i.  e.  @xmath15 .",
    "the system with applied control is stable if the absolute value of the eigenvalues of the iterated map is smaller than one , @xmath16 therefore @xmath9 has to be chosen between @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and this interval is of width @xmath19 and independent of @xmath20 , i.e. fixed points with arbitrary @xmath20 can be stabilized .",
    "this property however does not survive for delayed measurement .",
    "one has to develop further control strategies to cover this class of systems .      before discussing the time - discrete reduced dynamics in the poincar iteration",
    ", it should be clarified how this relates to an experimental control situation . on the first glance",
    ", the time - discrete viewpoint seems to correspond only to a case where the delay ( plus waiting time to the next poincar section ) exactly matches the orbit length , or a multiple of it .",
    "the generic experimental situation however comes up with a non - matching delay .",
    "application of all control methods discussed here requires to introduce an additional delay , usually by waiting for the next poincar crossing , so that measurement and control are applied without phase shift at the same position of the orbit . in this case",
    "the next poincar crossing position @xmath21 is a function of the values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 at a finite number of previous poincar crossings only , i.  e. it does not depend on intermediate positions .",
    "therefore the ( a priori infinite - dimensional ) delay system reduces to a finite - dimensional iterated map .",
    "if the delay ( plus the time of the waiting mechanism to the next poincar crossing ) is not matching the orbit length , the control schemes may perform less efficient . even for larger deviations from the orbit",
    ", the time between the poincar crossings will vary only marginally , thus a control amplitude should be available in time . in practical situations therefore the delay should not exceed the orbit length minus the variance of the orbit length that appears in the respective system and control setup .    in a formal sense , the poincar approach ensures robustness with respect to uncertainties in the orbit length , as it always ensures a synchronized reset of both trajectories and control . between",
    "the poincar crossings the control parameter is constant , the system is independent of everything _ in advance of _ the last poincar crossing .",
    "it is solely determined by the differential equation ( or experimental dynamics ) .",
    "thus the next crossing position is a well defined iterated function of the previous one .",
    "this is quite in contrast to the situation of a delay - differential equation ( as in pyragas control ) , which has an infinite - dimensional initial condition it ` never gets rid of ' .",
    "one may proceed to stability analysis via floquet theory @xcite as investgated for continuous @xcite and poincar - based @xcite control schemes .",
    "though a poincar crossing detection may be applied as well , the position will depend not only on the last crossing , but also on all values of the system variable within a time horizon defined by the maximum of the delay length and the ( maximal ) time difference between two poincar crossings ( due to the non - stroboscopic character ) .",
    "thus the poincar iteration would be a function between two infinite - dynamical spaces .",
    "apart from further mathematical subtleties , for a delay differential equation with fixed delay the major advantage of a poincar map , reducing the system dynamics to a low - dimensional system , thus completely breaks down .    for all control schemes discussed within this paper ,",
    "howvever the additional dimensionality is not a continuous horizon of states , but merely a finite set of values that were measured at the previous poincar crossings .",
    "to illustrate the problem , we recall the simple case where no modification of the ogy scheme is taken into account @xcite . for @xmath0 time steps delay , unmodified proportional feedback is applied : @xmath24 without loss of generality , we can choose @xmath25 if no control is applied , and @xmath26 in the remainder . using",
    "the time - delayed coordinates @xmath27 : @xmath28 to ensure stability , one has to fulfill @xmath29 for all eigenvalues @xmath30 .",
    "the stability area is investigated in @xcite , yielding a @xmath0-dependent maximal ljapunov number of @xmath31 for @xmath32 no control is possible @xcite .      as pointed out for difference control in the case @xmath33 in @xcite",
    ", one can eliminate the additional degrees of freedom caused by the delay term .",
    "one can restrict himself to apply control rhythmically only every @xmath34 timesteps ( @xmath35 for difference control ) , and then leave the system uncontrolled for the remaining timesteps",
    ". then @xmath36 appears to be time - dependent with @xmath37 and , after @xmath38 iterations of ( [ eq : matrixogyunmodified ] ) , we again have a matrix as in ( [ eq : matrixogyunmodified ] ) , but with @xmath39 instead of @xmath20 .",
    "equivalently , we can write @xmath40 what we have done here , is : controlling the @xmath38-fold iterate of the original system .",
    "this appears to be formally elegant , but leads to practically uncontrollable high effective lyapunov numbers @xmath39 for both large @xmath20 and large  @xmath0 .",
    "even if the rhythmic control method is of striking simplicity , it remains unsatisfying that control is kept quiet , or inactive , for @xmath0 time steps .",
    "even if the state of the system @xmath22 is known delayed by @xmath0 , one knows ( in principle ) the values of @xmath41 for @xmath42 , and one could ( in principle ) store the values @xmath43 of the control amplitudes applied to the system .",
    "this can be done , depending on the timescale , by analog or digital delay lines , or by storing the values in a computer or signal processor ( there are some intermediate frequency ranges where an experimental setup is difficult ) .",
    "both methods , rhythmic control and simple feedback control in every time step , have their disadvantages .    for rhythmic control",
    "it is necessary to use rather large control amplitudes , in average @xmath44 , and noise sums up to an amplitude increased by factor @xmath45 .    for simple feedback control the dimension of the system",
    "is increased and the maximal controllable lyapunov number is bounded by ( [ lmaxvontau ] ) .",
    "one might wonder if there are control strategies that avoid these limitations .",
    "this has necessarily to be done by applying control in each time step , but with using knowledge what control has been applied between the last measured time step @xmath46 and  @xmath47 . this concept can be implemented in at least two ways , by storing previous values of @xmath41 or previous values of @xmath48 ( lplc ) .",
    "the first memory method extends the single delay line to several delay lines , using one control gain coefficient for each : @xmath49    for @xmath50 steps memory ( and one step delay ) the control matrix is @xmath51 with the characteristic polynomial @xmath52 we can choose @xmath53 and evaluate optimal values for all @xmath54 by comparing with the coefficients of the product @xmath55 .",
    "this method allows control up to @xmath56 , therefore arbitrary @xmath20 can be controlled if a memory length of @xmath57 and the optimal coefficents @xmath54 are used .    for more than one step delay",
    ", one has the situation @xmath58 .",
    "this prohibits the trivial pole placement given above , ( choosing all @xmath30 to the same value ) and therefore reduces the maximal controllable @xmath20 and no general scheme for optimal selection of the @xmath54 applies .",
    "one can alternatively use the lplc method described below , which provides an optimal control scheme .",
    "one could wonder why to consider the previous state memory scheme at all when it does not allow to make all eigenvalues zero in _ any _ case .",
    "first , the case of up to one orbit delay and moderately small @xmath20 already covers many low - period orbits .",
    "second , there may be experimental setups where the feedback of previous states through additional delay elements and an analog circuit is experimentally more feasible than feedback of controlled amplitudes .",
    "in summary , all three methods discussed in this section have principal restrictions , but may be of advantage in special situations especially when a simple setup is required .",
    "if it is possible to store the previously applied control amplitudes @xmath59 , then one can predict the actual state @xmath41 of the system using the linear approximation around the fixed point .",
    "that is , from the last measured value @xmath60 and the control amplitudes we compute estimated values iteratively by @xmath61 leading to a _ predicted _ value @xmath62 of the actual system state .",
    "then the original ogy formula can be applied , i.  e. @xmath63 . in this method",
    "the gain parameters are again linear in @xmath60 and all @xmath64 with @xmath65 , and the optimal gain parameters can be expressed in terms of @xmath20 and @xmath66 .",
    "in contrast to the memory method presented in the previous subsection , the lplc method directs the system ( in linear approximation ) in one time step onto the fixed point .",
    "however , when this control algorithm is switched on , one has no control applied between @xmath46 and @xmath67 , so the trajectory has to be fairly near to the orbit ( in an interval with a length of order @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the interval halfwidth where control is switched on ) .",
    "therefore the time one has to wait until the control can be successfully activated is of order @xmath70 larger than in the case of undelayed control .",
    "the lplc method can also be derived as a general linear feedback in the last measured system state and all applied control amplitudes since the system was measured ; choosing the feedback gain parameters so that the linearized system has all eigenvalues zero .",
    "the linear ansatz @xmath71 leads to the dynamics in combined delayed coordinates + @xmath72 @xmath73 giving the characteristic polynomial @xmath74 all eigenvalues can be set to zero using @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the general formulas even for more than one positive lyapunov exponent or multiparameter control are given in appendix  [ app_ogy ] .",
    "one can also consider a nonlinear predictive logging control ( nlplc ) strategy as the straightforward extension to the lplc method for nonlinear prediction .",
    "if the system has a delay of several time steps , the interval where control is achieved becomes too small .",
    "however , if it is possible to extract the first nonlinearities from the time series , prediction ( and control ) can be fundamentally improved . in nlplc",
    "the behaviour of the system is predicted each time step by @xmath77 with using the applied control amplitudes @xmath78 for each time step .",
    "this equation has to be solved for @xmath6 using @xmath79 .",
    "a similar nonlinear prediction method has been described by petrov and showalter @xcite .",
    "they approximate the @xmath80 surface directly from the time series and use it to direct the system to any desired point .",
    "both taylor approximation or petrov and showalter method can be used here iteratively , provided one knows the delay length .",
    "both approaches could be regarded as a nonlinear method of model predictive control @xcite , applied to the poincar iteration dynamics .    from a practical point of view",
    ", it has to be mentioned that one has to know the fixed point @xmath1 more accurate than in the linear case .",
    "otherwise one experiences a smaller range of stability and additionally a permanent nonvanishing control amplitude will remain .",
    "this may be of disadvantage especially if the fixed point drifts in time ( e.g. by other external parameters such as temperature ) or if the time series used to determine the parameters is too short .",
    "as all methods mentioned above require the knowledge of the position of the fixed point , one may wish to stabilize purely by feeding back differences of the system variable at different times . without delay ,",
    "difference feedback can be used successfully for @xmath81 , and eigenvalues of modulus smaller than unity of the matrix @xmath82 are obtained only for @xmath83 , so this method stabilizes only for oscillatory repulsive fixed points with @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "due to the inherent one period delay of mdc , the @xmath0 period delay case of mdc corresponds , in terms of the number of degrees of freedom , to the @xmath34 period delay case of lplc .      in the presence of @xmath0 steps",
    "delay the linearized dynamics of a simple difference feedback @xmath85 is given by @xmath86 in delayed coordinates @xmath87 . as we have to use @xmath88 in addition to @xmath60 ,",
    "the system is of dimension @xmath35 , and the lower bound of lyapunov numbers that can be controlled are found to be @xcite @xmath89 the controllable range is smaller than for unmodified ogy control , and is restricted to oscillatory repulsive fixed points with @xmath90 .",
    "a striking observation is that inserting @xmath91 for @xmath0 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambdamaxogy ] ) leads exactly to the expression in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambdamaxdiff ] ) which reflects the fact that the difference feedback can be interpreted as a discretized first time derivative , taken at time @xmath92 . for details and stability area see @xcite .",
    "to enlarge the range of controllable @xmath20 , one again has the possibility to reduce the dimension of the control process in linear approximation to one by applying control every @xmath35 time steps . @xmath93 and",
    "the goal @xmath94 can be fulfilled by @xmath95 one has to choose @xmath96 between @xmath97 to achieve control as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : peri_difftau012345 ] .",
    "the case @xmath33 has already been discussed in @xcite . with rhythmic control",
    ", there is no range limit for @xmath20 , and even fixed points with positive @xmath20 can be stabilized by this method .    when using differences for periodic feedback , one still has the problem that the control gain increases by @xmath98 , and noise sums up for @xmath34 time steps before the next control signal is applied .",
    "additionally , now there is a singularity for @xmath99 in the `` optimal '' control gain given by ( [ eq : peridiff_opt ] ) .",
    "this concerns fixed points where differences @xmath100 when escaping from the fixed point are naturally small due to a @xmath20 near to @xmath101 .",
    "here one has to decide between using a large control gain ( but magnifying noise and finite precision effects ) or using a small control gain of order @xmath102 ( but having larger eigenvalues and therefore slow convergence ) .",
    "two other strategies that have been discussed by socolar and gauthier @xcite are discretized versions of time - continuous methods .",
    "control between @xmath103 and @xmath104 is possible with discrete - etdas ( @xmath105 ) @xmath106 and control between @xmath107 and @xmath104 is acheived with discrete - ntdas ( let @xmath108 be a positive integer ) @xmath109 both methods can be considered to be of advantage even in time - discrete control in the poincar section , e.g. if the number of adjustable parameters has to be kept small . whereas these methods are mainly applied in time - continuous control , especially in analogue or optical experiments , for time - discrete control the mdc strategy described below allows to overcome the limitations in the lyapunov number .",
    "one may wish to generalize the linear predictive feedback to difference feedback . in contrary to the lplc case , the reconstruction of the state @xmath60 from differences @xmath110 and applied control amplitudes @xmath111 is no longer unique . as a consequence ,",
    "there are infinitely many ways to compute an estimate for the present state of the system , but only a subset of these leads to a controller design ensuring convergence to the fixed point .    under these there exists an optimal every - step control for difference feedback with minimal eigenvalues and in this sense optimal stability .",
    "this memory difference control ( mdc ) method has been demonstrated in an electronic experiment @xcite and a plasma diode @xcite .    to derive the feedback rule",
    ", we directly make the linear ansatz @xmath112 leading to the dynamics in combined delayed coordinates @xmath113 with @xmath114    giving the characteristic polynomial @xmath115 all eigenvalues can be set to zero using @xmath116 @xmath117 and @xmath76 for @xmath118 .",
    "+ the general formulas even for more than one positive lyapunov exponent or multiparameter control are given in appendix  [ app_diff ] .",
    "we have presented methods to improve poincar - section based chaos control for delayed measurement . for both classes of algorithms , ogy control and difference control ,",
    "delay affects control , and improved control strategies have to be applied .",
    "improved strategies contain one of the following principle ideas : rhythmic control , control with memory for previous states , or control with memory for previously applied control amplitudes .    in special cases the unmodified control , previous state memory control , or rhythmic control methods",
    "could be considered , especially when experimental conditions restrict the possibilities of designing the control strategy .",
    "in general , the proposed lplc and mdc strategies allow a so - called deadbeat control with all eigenvalues zero ; and they are in this sense optimal control methods .",
    "all parameters needed for controller design can be calculated from linearization parameters that can be fitted directly from experimental data .",
    "this approach has also been sucessfully applied in an electronic @xcite and plasma @xcite experiment .",
    "here we derive how for one unstable dimension the stabilization problem reduces to the one - dimensional case . using a covariant basis from right eigenvectors @xmath119 and @xmath120 to eigenvectors @xmath121 und @xmath122 and the corresponding contravariant left eigenvectors @xmath123 and @xmath124 of matrix @xmath125 . we can transform the linearized dynamics @xmath126 with help of @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "we define as coordinates in the eigensystem @xmath129 and @xmath130 giving @xmath131 we consider a general ansatz that the control signal is linear in @xmath132 and @xmath133 , @xmath134 here @xmath135 is ogy control .",
    "for @xmath6 follows @xmath136 if control in stable direction is chosen zero , i.e. @xmath137 , the dynamics decouples in two two systems in stable direction ( that is unaffected , but was stable before ) and in unstable direction , @xmath138 this equation is only one - dimensional , so it is sufficient to investigate the one - dimensional control problem if there is only one instable direction .",
    "the generalization to higher - dimensional unstable subspaces is straightforward .",
    "we consider the motion around an unstable fixed point @xmath139 of the map @xmath140 where @xmath141 and @xmath142 have the same dimension of the phase space of the system ( although it is desirable to achieve control with a minor number of control parameters ) .",
    "the linear time evoution around the instable fixed point ( we choose @xmath143 and @xmath144 in the fixed point ) is given by jacobians @xmath145 and @xmath146 @xmath147 delayed measurement means that the applied control @xmath141 can only be computed from an older value @xmath148 .",
    "additionally one can store the control amplitudes @xmath149 applied in the meantime to the system and use the linearization to predict the present position @xmath150 ( linear predictive logging control , lplc @xcite ) .",
    "thus we have the general feedback ansatz @xmath151 under the condition that @xmath152 , the feedback can be chosen to @xmath153 iterating @xmath154 , one has @xmath155",
    "now we show that even fixed points whose exact position is not given ( only an approximative value is needed to determine the position of a @xmath69-ball inside which control is switched on ) can be stabilized by a difference control method that is similar to the lplc method given above , even if one has only delayed knowledge of differences of the system variables @xmath156 .",
    "combined with stored values of the meantime control amplitudes @xmath157 we propose the control scheme @xmath158 with the feedback matrices @xmath159 here we have to assume that not only @xmath160 but also @xmath161 is invertible . using the linear approximation one easily computes directly that this control leads to @xmath162 , and again this is a so - called deadbeat control scheme where all eigenvalues are zero .",
    "using the linearized dynamics , we have @xmath163 and the next iteration reads @xmath164 by this method the delay can be overcome and even fixed points whose position is known inaccurate can be stabilized from measured differences , provided that one has a sufficient number of control parameters , i.  e. @xmath165 , and both @xmath160 and @xmath161 are invertible .",
