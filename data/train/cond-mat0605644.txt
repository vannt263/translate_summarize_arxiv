    "in recent years a considerable amount of theoretical research activity @xcite has been stimulated by the conjecture that a certain class of dynamical systems might be governed by a peculiar thermal statistics , in which the usual boltzmann  gibbs exponential distribution is replaced by a type of power - law distribution originally proposed by tsallis @xcite . such a conjecture seems to be supported by phenomenological and computational evidence coming from various domains of physics and other disciplines .",
    "it has been proposed in various ways to define a generalized entropy function , according to formulae involving a parameter @xmath0 directly related to the characteristic exponent of the power - law distribution ( whence the frequently used name of `` @xmath0-distributions '' ) .",
    "it appears then natural to extend to these systems also the concept of temperature , in such a way that the validity of the second law of thermodynamics is preserved .",
    "however some difficulties have to be faced in order to define the condition of thermal equilibrium and to consistently generalize for these systems the zeroth law of thermodynamics .",
    "the simplest possibility is apparently that of treating systems at thermal equilibrium as statistically independent of one another @xcite .",
    "however , it has already been recognized that the assumption of such an independence has no fundamental justification .",
    "furthermore , the probability distribution for a composed system obtained by multiplication of two power - law distributions does not belong in general to the same category .",
    "this problem is not present in the boltzmann  gibbs case thanks to the identity @xmath4 , which represents a peculiar property of the exponential function . as a way out of this difficulty , a generalization of the zeroth law in the spirit of superstatistics @xcite has recently been proposed @xcite .",
    "a different approach to the thermodynamics of systems with power - law statistics has been developed following the observation that a distribution of this type can also be formally derived using standard arguments of equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "in fact , in the same way as the usual boltzmann ",
    "gibbs distribution is derived for a system in thermal contact with an infinite heat bath , a power - law distribution is obtained when the heat bath is instead characterized by a finite number of degrees of freedom and a power - law density - of - states function @xcite . in such a situation , it becomes natural to define the physical temperature by making use of the equipartition theorem @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that , when the inverse of this temperature is used as the integrating factor of the exchanged heat , in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics , the definition of the entropy has to be modified with respect to the original tsallis formula @xcite .",
    "it has however to be noted that the presence of a finite heat bath can only be assumed when the power - law distributions present a finite energy cut - off , which is not the case for all the possible ranges of the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the distinction between `` observed system '' on the one side , and `` heat bath '' on the other , which has been followed in refs.@xcite in analogy with familiar considerations of standard thermodynamics , appears somewhat fictitious when both systems are supposed to be finite . in the present paper we shall then abandon the concept of heat bath altogether , and we shall only use that of mutual thermal ( meta)equilibrium , in a form which can in principle be applied to systems obeying any ( _ a priori _ arbitrary ) generalized type of thermal statistics . if we consider a system composed of parts in mutual thermal contact , it is obvious that when the system is in a stationary state , its parts are in thermal metaequilibrium with one another ( of course , the parts in question may be either of homogeneous or of heterogeneous physical nature ) .",
    "we shall investigate , with the widest possible generality , the logical consequences of this simple fact in connection with the laws of thermodynamics .",
    "in particular , in order to determine the correct definition for the absolute temperature , we shall naturally impose the condition that , in accordance with the zeroth law , systems at equilibrium must have the same temperature .",
    "we shall see that such an approach applies equally well to tsallis distributions having a finite energy cutoff , and to those showing instead a power tail extending to infinitely large energies .    from a mathematical point of view , in order to apply in a consistent way the concept of thermal equilibrium to states described by tsallis statistics , we have first of all to establish under which conditions the probability distribution for a composed system , and the marginal distributions which are derived from it , can all have simultaneously a power - law dependence on the energy",
    ". we will show that a sufficient condition is that also the densities - of - states of all the subsystems considered are given by power functions of the energy .",
    "of course we know that this is indeed the case for ideal gases , and represents a good approximation for a quite large class of systems .",
    "for these systems we can then interpret tsallis statistics as a general description of metaequilibrium states , which is consistent with the zeroth law of thermodynamics .",
    "with respect to standard statistical mechanics @xcite , which is only based on the boltzmann ",
    "gibbs distribution , the new theory contains a set of additional parameters , the @xmath0 values of the systems considered .",
    "it will be shown that these parameters , in order for thermal equilibrium to establish , must be in a certain relationship with the respective numbers of degrees of freedom .",
    "the first and second laws of thermodynamics maintain their validity for systems governed by power - law distributions .",
    "an important point , which will emerge from our analysis , is that these laws , when considered in combination with the zeroth one , univocally determine the expression of both the temperature and entropy functions .",
    "it will turn out that , for systems to which our starting hypotheses can be applied , the correct expression for the entropy coincides with that originally proposed by rnyi @xcite .",
    "the consideration of power - law densities of states will also allow us to clarify some aspects of power - law distributions , which have often been overlooked in the past literature .",
    "it will be shown that the distributions with a finite energy cutoff have properties intermediate between the microcanonical and the canonical ensembles ( which are exactly obtained in the two limiting cases @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively ) , whereas those with an infinite power tail represent a basically new physical situation .",
    "the consideration of the parameter @xmath0 alone can be misleading . in the case of large systems , @xmath0 is in fact always necessarily close to 1 , but we will show that this by no means implies that the character of the distribution is necessarily close to boltzmann  gibbs .",
    "we propose the introduction of a new parameter @xmath1 , expressed as a function of both @xmath0 and the number of degrees of freedom , which provides an estimate of the actual deviations from the canonical distribution .",
    "sections [ prelim0][pdof ] deal with some basic facts about statistical thermodynamics , power - law distributions and power - law densities of states respectively .",
    "although some of the results we shall obtain in these sections are not completely new , we shall present them with an emphasis on those aspects which are at the basis of our particular approach to generalized thermodynamics .",
    "this will lead us in sec .",
    "[ class ] to our new classification of power - law distributions by means of the parameter @xmath1 , and in sec .",
    "[ thermo ] to the main results about the statistical expression of thermodynamic temperature and entropy .",
    "let us consider a system @xmath7 composed of two weakly coupled subsystems @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we shortly denote with @xmath10 the set of @xmath11 canonical variables @xmath12 of the phase space @xmath13 of the subsystem @xmath8 , and with @xmath14 the corresponding hamiltonian function .",
    "if the same notation is used for the subsystem @xmath9 , the fact that the coupling between the two is weak allows us to express with good approximation the hamiltonian @xmath15 of the complete system @xmath7 as @xmath16 .",
    "we define the function @xmath17 as the volume of the region of space @xmath13 corresponding to energies of the subsystem @xmath8 lower than @xmath18 . introducing the step function @xmath19 such that @xmath20 for @xmath21 , @xmath22 for @xmath23",
    ", we can write @xmath24 where @xmath25 stands for a @xmath11-dimensional volume element of @xmath13 . the derivative @xmath26 of the above function can then be identified with the `` density of states '' of @xmath8 : @xmath27 after defining in the same way the functions @xmath28 and @xmath29 for the subsystem @xmath9 , we obtain @xcite for the corresponding functions of the complete system @xmath7 : @xmath30    with each macroscopic state of the system is associated a probability density function @xmath31 on the space @xmath32 . as a consequence of liouville s theorem @xcite , a stationary probability density can only be a function of constants of motion of the system .",
    "it is usual in statistical mechanics to assume that @xmath31 is actually only a function of the energy .",
    "we will then write @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a function of a single real variable , on which no particular hypothesis is made for the moment .",
    "the marginal distribution @xmath35 for the subsystem @xmath8 , defined as @xmath36 , can then be expressed as @xmath37 , where    [ marginal ] @xmath38 we have similarly @xmath39 , with @xmath40    since @xmath41 represents the probability density function for the energy , defining the functional @xmath42 as the average of the function @xmath43 we have @xmath44 and similarly for @xmath45 and @xmath46 . making use of eqs.([omega ] ) and ( [ marginal ] ) we find @xmath47 or equivalently @xcite @xmath48 for the case of a system @xmath49 described by a microcanonical ensemble , the quantity @xmath42 was given the name of `` empirical temperature '' in ref .",
    "@xcite , on the grounds of the equipartition theorem . for our present purposes ,",
    "the main point is that eq .",
    "( [ theta ] ) has here been proved in a completely general way , independently of any assumptions about the specific form of the probability density or of the density - of - states functions . as we explained in the introduction , we assume that the parts of an isolated system in a stationary state are in thermal ( meta)equilibrium with each other",
    ". we can then affirm that the functional @xmath42 assumes the same value for any two systems for which this equilibrium condition is fulfilled .",
    "such a result is not sufficient to conclude at this point that @xmath42 represents the correct generalized definition of thermodynamical temperature , since the second law has not yet been taken into consideration . besides",
    ", there could exist in principle other quantities independent of @xmath42 which , at least for a certain class of systems , enjoy a property of the same form as that expressed by eq .",
    "( [ theta ] ) .",
    "if we denote the set of such hypothetical quantities with @xmath50 , we can provisionally conclude that a generalized formula for the inverse temperature @xmath51 in statistical mechanics , in order to be consistent with the zeroth law of thermodynamics , has to be expressible as an appropriate function of @xmath42 and @xmath50 of the form @xmath52      if the hamiltonian @xmath15 depends , besides on @xmath53 , also on some external parameters @xmath54 ( such as for instance the volume , or the linear dimensions of the system s container ) , then under the infinitesimal variations @xmath55 of these parameters the system performs on the surrounding environment the average work @xmath56 with @xmath57 . from the first law of thermodynamics we get @xmath58",
    "the above equation provides the expression in the language of statistical mechanics for the quantity of heat @xmath59 which is exchanged by the system in an infinitesimal reversible transformation .    according to the so called clausius theorem , which is based on the second law of thermodynamics",
    ", @xmath60 admits an integrating factor which can be identified with the inverse of the absolute temperature . it can be easily shown that a sufficient condition for the validity of an equivalent theorem in statistical thermodynamics is the existence of a real function @xmath61 , with a concavity of definite sign , such that the probability distribution @xmath31 can be obtained as a stationary point of the functional @xmath62 under the constraints    [ constra ] @xmath63 and @xmath64    equation ( [ constra1 ] ) simply imposes the correct normalization for the probability density , while eq .",
    "( [ constra2 ] ) fixes the value @xmath65 for the mean energy of the system .",
    "introducing the lagrange multipliers @xmath66 and @xmath67 , such a constrained extreme can be located as the zero of a functional derivative in the following way : @xmath68 the hypothesis we have made on the concavity of @xmath61 guarantees that @xmath69 is a monotone function , and therefore admits an inverse function which we call @xmath70 . from the last equation",
    "it then follows that we can write @xmath71 with @xmath72 equation ( [ moltiplic ] ) implies that @xmath73 for any arbitrary variations @xmath74 at fixed @xmath54 .",

    "the above equation shows that the state function @xmath67 , defined as the lagrange multiplier which solves the system of equations ( [ constra])([moltiplic ] ) , is an integrating factor for @xmath60 .",
