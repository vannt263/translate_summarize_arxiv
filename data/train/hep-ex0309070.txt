    "the continuing processes of gluon radiation and @xmath15production result in a parton shower which only terminates when the partons ( quarks and gluons ) reach energy scales of @xmath16  gev .",
    "final states at this stage are referred to as parton - level . at these scales",
    "the increasing strong coupling causes the formation of colourless bound states of quarks , i.e. hadrons .",
    "this process , known as hadronisation , is not well understood at a fundamental level in qcd but many successful models based on qcd have been developed .",
    "the hadronic final state after decays of short lived particles ( usually defined to have lifetimes @xmath17  ps ) is said as being at the hadron - level .",
    "it is well known that the hadronic final states in @xmath0  annihilation show a so - called jet structure , i.e. several groups of particles are observed in relatively small and separate regions of the solid angle around the interaction point .",
    "these structures are interpreted as remnants of the @xmath15  pair from the virtual photon or @xmath12  decay and possible energetic gluon radiation .",
    "many definitions of jet finding algorithms  @xcite or event shape observables ( see e.g.  @xcite ) are used to quantify the jet structure and compare with predictions from qcd .    jet finding algorithms cluster particles lying closely together in phase space . as an example in the durham algorithm  @xcite the distance between two particles @xmath18 and",

    "alternatively , the value of @xmath26 where an event changes from a 3-jet to a 2-jet configuration is characteristic for its structure , i.e. a large value of @xmath27 indicates the presence of a significant third jet .    at the time of writing data of observables such as jet production rates or event shape distributions measured at centre - of - mass energies @xmath3",

    "the value @xmath28  at a scale @xmath31 is given by @xmath32  at a reference scale @xmath33 and the logarithmic ratio of the energy scales @xmath34 .",
    "however , hadronisation effects scale like @xmath35 , with @xmath36 for many jet algorithms or event shape observables , implying that a meaningful comparison of qcd predictions with data requires a detailed understanding of the scale dependencies of perturbative qcd and as well as of the hadronisation effects .",
