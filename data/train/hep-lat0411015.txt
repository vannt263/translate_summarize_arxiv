    "@xmath6 is a linear combination of products of gauge links at time @xmath7 along paths @xmath8 and @xmath9 defines the spin structure of the operator . the @xmath10 means the average over the whole lattice .",
    "the energies are then extracted by fitting the @xmath2 with a sum of exponentials , @xmath11 where the number of exponentials , @xmath12 , is 2 , 3 , or 4 and the time range @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 is in practice a @xmath15 matrix for different fuzzings ( the indices are omitted in eq .",
    "[ equ_c2 ] for clarity ) .",
    "this fuzzing enables us to extract not only a more accurate value of @xmath16 , the energy of the ground state , but also an estimate of the first radially excited state , @xmath17 . after taking the continuum limit we can interpolate in the light quark mass and use charmed meson experimental results to interpolate in the heavy quark mass to get a @xmath0 meson .",
    "the energy spectrum was measured using different lattices : q3 is a @xmath18 quenched lattice ( for more details see @xcite ) , df2 is a @xmath18 lattice and df3 , df4 are @xmath19 unquenched lattices .",

    "here l@xmath21(@xmath22 ) means that the light quark spin couples to orbital angular momentum l giving the total @xmath23 .",
    "( since the heavy quark is infinitely heavy its spin does not play a role here . )",
    "however , in the case of qcd the confining potential is important for large distances and thus l@xmath22 should eventually lie higher than l@xmath21 for higher angular momentum states . experimentally this inversion is not seen for p - waves , and now the lattice measurements show that there is no inversion in the d - wave states either .",
    "in fact , the d@xmath21 and d@xmath22 states seem to be nearly degenerate , _",
    "i.e. _ the spin - orbit splitting is very small ( see fig .  [",

    "[ fig_x11 ] compares the ground state vector ( charge ) distribution with the scalar ( matter ) distribution .",
    "the matter distribution seems to drop off faster than the charge distribution .",
    "however , at @xmath38 the charge and matter distributions are roughly equal . also note that the p - wave matter distribution changes its sign .",
    "( hence the logarithmic scale in the s - wave plot but a linear scale in the p - wave plot in fig .",

    "[ fig_x12 ] the charge and matter first excited state distributions are compared . as expected ,",
    "a node is clearly seen in these excited state distributions .",
    "the radial distributions shown here are for df2 , but the analogous calculations for df3 and df4 are in progress .",
    "these distributions can be now treated as `` experimental data '' that needs understanding .    .",

    "there are several advantages for model makers : first of all , since the heavy quark is infinitely heavy , we have essentially a one - body problem . secondly ,",
    "on the lattice we know what we put in  one heavy quark and one light anti - quark  which makes the lattice system much more simple than the real world .",
    "we can , for example , try to use the dirac equation to interpret the s- and p - wave distributions . if the solutions of the dirac equation are called @xmath42 ( the `` large '' component ) and @xmath43 ( the `` small '' component ) we get @xmath44 for the charge distribution and @xmath45 for the matter distribution .",

    "the values of these parameters are not tuned yet , because at this stage we only want to show that a reasonable set of parameters can give a qualitative description of the lattice data .",
    "the qualitative agreement is surprisingly good  see fig .",
    "[ fig_dirac ] .",
    "the dirac equation approach gives a natural explanation , for example , to the fact that the matter distribution drops off faster than the charge distribution .",
    "also the change of sign in the p - wave matter distribution comes out automatically .",
    "the key points are :    * there should be several narrow @xmath0 states , in particular the @xmath47 that lies below the @xmath1 threshold . *",
    "the spin - orbit splitting is very small , contrary to the expectation predicted by a linearly rising potential that is purely scalar . * the radial distributions of s and p@xmath22 states",
    "can be qualitatively understood by using a dirac equation model ."
