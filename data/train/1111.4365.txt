    ", the relaxation will be markovian or non - markovian depending on the values of @xmath6 and @xmath16 .",
    "the case of the semiconducting bath is the opposite : @xmath254 show a gap as a function of the field @xmath6 for all @xmath258 , indicating non - markovian behavior at low @xmath6 and markovian behavior for fields @xmath259 as shown in the left panels of fig .",
    "[ figura7_v7 ] . finally , for large fields @xmath260 any finite @xmath6 leads to finite rates irrespective of the value of @xmath83 .",
    "consequently , we have the surprising result that there exists a range of fields @xmath261 and @xmath262 where @xmath263 and @xmath264 denote the corresponding chemical potentials for the semiconducting and metallic baths , for which the metallic bath is more effective in suppressing relaxation and decoherence than the semiconducting bath .",

    "the semiconducting bath has a lower rate and at very high temperatures the two baths are indistinguishable as expected .",
    "+ to summarize , we find that external magnetic fields do not necessarily reduce the relaxation and decoherence rates of the qubit .",
    "depending on the nature of the bath and the values of the field , one sees a rich and varied behavior of the rates .",
    "for instance , in the absence of an intrinsic qubit field ( @xmath234 ) , we find that the presence of a gap in the density of states leads to a non - monotonic variation of the rates as a function of the bath field @xmath16 . in the presence of both fields , @xmath6 and @xmath16 , an interplay between the two magnetic fields leads to a very interesting regime wherein for a qubit field @xmath276 , the metallic bath has lower rates as compared to the semiconductor .",
    "the bounds @xmath277 and @xmath278 are functions of the gap @xmath79 , the bath field @xmath16 and the temperature . for any given @xmath16 , there exists a value of the bath field @xmath242 for which we have an almost temperature independent relaxation . for very high bath fields",
    ", the relaxation rate goes to zero but the decoherence rate remains finite signaling the non - ising nature of the qubit - bath coupling .",
    "it would be very interesting to see if these features survive in the presence of an additional transverse field on the qubit .",
    "we have studied the decoherence and relaxation of a central spin weakly coupled to a bath of electrons described by different densities of states having a gap , using two well known approximation schemes , nz and tcl .",
    "though both methods predict an asymptotic markovian decay for a metallic bath , we have shown that in the case of a semiconducting bath , the tcl predicts a markovian behavior at low @xmath19 whereas the nz approximation predicts non - markovian behavior .",
    "the study of the validity of both approximation techniques is left for future work .",
    "we emphasize that one has to exert care when using approximation schemes to study the time evolution of the density matrix .",
    "we find that a gap in the spectrum , even one away from the fermi level , generates an intermediate power law regime for the coherences at finite temperatures .",
    "depending on the parameters of the problem , this power law regime can be made sufficiently large so as to be relevant for experiments .",
    "one might also question the validity of the weak coupling formalism used here since it is well known that even the equilibrium physics of the kondo model is governed by strong coupling physics , which leads to a complete screening of the kondo spin .",
    "this was explored in ref.@xcite , where numerical renormalization group methods were used to study the decoherence of the kondo spin .",
    "it was found that for any value of the coupling @xmath10 there is a kondo timescale @xmath279 beyond which the kondo spin gets screened dynamically .",
    "the weak coupling results discussed here were indeed valid for _ intermediate _ times @xmath280 . in this paper , since we are only interested in very small @xmath10 , we expect our results to be valid for realistically long times since the time scale @xmath281 as @xmath34 . + we have also calculated the relaxation and decoherence rate as a function of external magnetic fields applied on the bath and/or central spin .",
    "we encounter novel situations where for moderately large fields on the central spin alone result in a nearly temperature independent relaxation but a rapidly increasing decoherence .",
    "we find that the presence of gap anywhere in the density of states has important ramifications for the rates .",
    "this leads to the case where for a certain range of the bath field @xmath16 , there is a regime @xmath267 , where we have the surprising result that the metallic bath has lower rates of relaxation and decoherence as compared to the semiconductor . to conclude , there exists an interesting interplay between the gap in the density of states and the applied magnetic fields , which can have a lot of practical advantages for experiments on qubits .    -",
