    "the search for violations of fundamental symmetries has played a central role in the development of particle physics in the 20@xmath0 century . in particular ,",
    "tests of the discrete symmetries , charge conjugation @xmath1 , parity @xmath2 , and time - reversal @xmath3 , have been of paramount importance in establishing the structure of the standard model ( sm ) . perhaps the most famous example was the discovery of parity violation in the weak interactions @xcite , which led to the realization that matter fields should be combined into asymmetric left- and right - handed chiral multiplets , one of the cornerstones of the standard model .",
    "the observation of @xmath4 violation , via the mixing of kaons @xcite , also subsequently provided strong evidence for the presence of three quark and lepton generations , via the kobayashi - maskawa mechanism @xcite , prior to direct experimental evidence for the third family .",
    "it is interesting to recall that one of the first tests of this kind , actually pre - dating the discovery of parity violation in the weak interactions , was a probe of parity invariance within the  at the time unknown  theory of the strong interactions . in 1949 ,",
    "purcell and ramsey argued , in a way that at the time was not fully appreciated that , lacking a theory of the strong interactions , there was no way to `` derive '' parity invariance and thus one must confirm parity conservation by experimental tests , or discover the lack thereof , rather than rely on a belief that nature `` must be symmetric '' . as a probe of parity violation , purcell and ramsey proposed that one consider an intrinsic electric dipole moment of the neutron . placed in a magnetic and electric field , a neutral nonrelativistic particle of spin @xmath5 can be described by the following hamiltonian , h = - - d * e *  . [ starting ] under the reflection of spatial coordinates , @xmath6 , whereas @xmath7 .",
    "the presence of a non - zero @xmath8 would therefore signify the existence of parity violation .",
    "it was soon realized that @xmath8 also breaks time - reversal invariance . indeed , under time reflection , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "therefore a non - zero @xmath8 may exist if and only if both parity and time reveral invariance are broken .",
    "analysis of the existing experimental data on neutron scattering from spin zero nuclei led to the conclusion , @xmath11 cm @xcite .",
    "such a result probes physics at distances much shorter than the typical scale of nuclear froces @xmath12fm , or the compton wavelength of the neutron .",
    "this initial limit on the neutron edm implied that @xmath2 and @xmath3 were good symmetries of the strong interactions at percent - level precision .",
    "it was only some 25 years later with the emergence of qcd that the possibility of @xmath3-violation ( or @xmath4-violation , on assuming the @xmath13 theorem ) in the strong interactions had some theoretical underpinning .",
    "indeed , qcd allows for the addition of a dimension - four term , known as the @xmath14-term , with a dimensionless coefficient @xmath14 which , if nonzero , would signify the violation of both @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "this term is somewhat unusual , being a purely topological boundary term , but its value determines a superselection sector in qcd @xcite and its presence is intrinsically tied to an elegant feature of the theory , namely the mechanism via which the mass of the @xmath15 meson is lifted well - above the scale one might naturally expect given its apparent status as a goldstone boson @xcite .",
    "however , were @xmath16 , one would predict a neutron edm of sufficient size to ensure that the original analysis of purcell and ramsey would have detected it .",
    "in fact @xmath14 is now known to be tuned to better than one part in @xmath17 !",
    "this tuning is the well - known",
    "_ strong @xmath4 problem _ of the standard model , which has been with us for more than 25 years , and has led to interesting dynamical mechanisms for its resolution ; some of these have important consequences and predictions for other aspects of particle physics and cosmology .",
    "the required tuning of this @xmath4-odd parameter in qcd comes into sharp focus when we put qcd into its rightful place within the standard model , which necessarily means coupling it to the electroweak sector and massive quarks in particular . in this case",
    "the physical value of @xmath14 acquires a contribution from the overall phase of the quark mass matrix . in this sense",
    "the strong @xmath4 problem can be phrased as the absence , to high precision , of _ flavour - diagonal _ @xmath4-violation within the standard model .",
    "this situation could not contrast more strongly with the situation in the flavour - changing sector , which is where all currently observed @xmath4-violating effects reside .",
    "indeed , the original discovery of @xmath4-violation in the system of neutral kaons @xcite , can be explained within this sector through the elegant and indeed rather minimal model of kobayashi and maskawa , which links @xmath4-violation to the single physical phase in the unitary ckm mixing matrix describing transitions between the three generations of quarks @xcite .",
    "this picture has recently received significant support  indeed essential confirmation  through experiments using neutral @xmath18 mesons @xcite .",
    "in contrast to @xmath14 , the phase in the ckm mixing matrix requires no tuning at all  its effects are nicely masked in the appropriate channels by the flavour structure of the standard model .",
    "indeed , it turns out that the predictions for any @xmath4-violating effect in the flavour - conserving channel induced by ckm mixing are minuscule , thus denying any hopes of detecting the experimental manifestation of ckm physics in these channels in the foreseeable future .",
    "searches for flavour - diagonal @xmath4-violation , while insensitive to the ckm phase , thus inherit on the flip - side the status as one of the unique , essentially `` background '' free , probes of new physics .",
    "electric dipole moments , through continuous experimental development since the work of purcell and ramsey , remain our most sensitive probes of this sector .",
    "all existing searches have failed to detect any intrinsic edm , and indeed the precision to which edms are now known to vanish is remarkable , and sufficient to render them some of the most important precision tests of the standard model . in this more general context , the strong @xmath4 problem , associated with the tuning of @xmath14 , becomes just the most highly tuned example among many possible @xmath4-odd operators which could contribute to the observable edms of nucleons , leptons , atoms and molecules . anticipating",
    "the presence of such @xmath4-odd sources is not without motivation . indeed ,",
    "one of the strongest motivations comes from cosmology , where the success of the inflationary scenaro , together with the observed cosmological dominance of baryons over antibaryons , suggests that a non - zero baryon number was generated dynamically in the early universe .",
    "according to the sakharov criteria @xcite , this requires a source of @xmath4-violation , and within the standard model , neither the kobayashi - maskawa phase nor the @xmath14term can create conditions that would lead to the generation of an appreciable net baryon number .",
    "this strongly suggests the presence of another , yet to be discovered , source of @xmath4 violation in nature .",
    "although exceptions exist , e.g. the leptogenesis scenario , edms generally provide a highly sensitive diagnostic for these new @xmath4-odd sources .",
    "the second prominent motivation arises from theoretical prejudices about the physics of the fermi scale , i.e. the mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking , currently the focus of intense theoretical and experimental work .",
    "there are several theoretical motivations to believe that new physics , beyond the sm higgs boson , should become apparent at , or just above , this scale , with weak - scale supersymmetry ( susy ) being a prominent example .",
    "flavour - diagonal @xmath4-violation constitutes a powerful probe of these scales , since any new physics need not provide the same flavour - dependent suppression factors as does the sm , while the sm itself constitutes a negligible background .",
    "these precision tests are thus highly complementary to direct searches at colliders .",
    "a rough estimate , based on the decoupling of new physics as the inverse square of its characteristic energy scale @xmath19 , currently gives us the possibility to probe an order one @xmath4-violating source at up to @xmath20 gev .",
    "in many weakly coupled theories , such as susy , this scale is somewhat lower , but often is still beyond the reach of existing and/or projected colliders . as with the link between the kobayashi - maskawa mechanism and the three - generation structure , one might hope that flavour - diagonal @xmath4-violation , or perhaps the lack thereof , will tell us something profound about the matter sector .    the level of experimental precision achieved in edm searches has improved dramatically since the early work of purcell and ramsey , and has been broadened to many atomic and nuclear quantities . indeed , following significant progress throughout the past decade , the edms of the neutron @xcite , and of several heavy atoms and molecules @xcite have been measured to vanish to remarkably high precision . from the present standpoint , it is convenient to classify the edm searches into three main categories , distinguished by the dominant physics which would induce the edm , at least within a generic class of models .",
    "these categories are : the edms of paramagnetic atoms and molecules ; the edms of diamagnetic atoms ; and the edms of hadrons , and nucleons in particular .",
    "for these three categories , the experiments that currently champion the best bounds on @xmath4-violating parameters are the atomic edms of thallium and mercury and that of the neutron , as listed in table  1 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ explimit ]    the upper limits on edms obtained in these experiments can be translated into tight constraints on the @xmath4-violating physics at and above the electroweak scale , with each category of edm primarily sensitive to different @xmath4-odd sources .",
    "for example , the neutron edm can be induced by @xmath4 violation in the quark sector , while paramagnetic edms generally result from @xmath4 violating sources that induce the electron edm . despite the apparent difference in the actual numbers in table  [ explimit ] ,",
    "all three limits on @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 actually have comparable sensitivity to fundamental @xmath4 violation , e.g. superpartner masses and @xmath4-violating phases , and thus play complementary roles in constraining fundamental @xmath4-odd soources .",
    "this fact can be explained by the way the so - called schiff screening theorem @xcite is violated in paramagnetic and diamagnetic atoms .",
    "the schiff theorem essentially amounts to the statement that , in the nonrelativistic limit and treating the nucleus as pointlike , the atomic edms will vanish due to screening of the applied electric field within a neutral atom .",
    "the paramagnetic and diamagnetic edms result from violations of this theorem due respectively to relativistic and finite - size effects , and in heavy atoms such violation is maximized . for heavy paramagnetic atoms , i.e. atoms with non - zero electron angular momentum",
    ", relativistic effects actually result in a net enhancement of the atomic edm over the electron edm . for diamagnetic species ,",
    "the schiff screening is violated due to the finite size of the nucleus , but this is a weaker effect and the induced edm of the atom is suppressed relative to the edm of the nucleus itself .",
    "these factors equilibrate the sensitivities of the various experimental constraints in table  [ explimit ] to more fundamental sources of @xmath4 violation",
    ".    in this paper we will review in detail the calculational aspects of applying the current bounds on edms to constrain new @xmath4-violating sources . in order to make the discussion as systematic as possible",
    ", we will proceed by working our way upwards in energy scale , using several effective @xmath4-odd lagrangians at the relevant thresholds . in the next section ,",
    "we begin by discussing the current status of the experimental constraints within three generic classes , namely the neutron edm , and the edms of paramagnetic and diamagnetic atoms , and describing the contributions to these edms at the nuclear scale .",
    "we then move to the qcd scale and introduce an effective @xmath4-odd effective quark - gluon lagrangian which plays an important role in the subsequent analysis . the leading term in this effective theory , of dimension four , is the @xmath14-term and we breifly review the strong @xmath4-problem and some of its proposed resolutions .",
    "we then turn in section  3 to qcd computations of the edms , and dwell on some of the calculational aspects which are currently some of the major sources of uncertainty in the application of edm constraints ( for a detailed discussion of many other aspects we refer the reader to @xcite ) . in section  4",
    ", we turn to the generation of these observables within specific models of @xmath4-violation , reviewing first the significant sources of suppression within the standard model , and then focussing on weak scale supersymmetry , and the mssm in particular , as the source of new physics at the electroweak scale .",
    "we discuss the generic constraints that edms impose on combinations of @xmath4-violating parameters in the susy - breaking sector , and also explore some additional effects which may arise in special parameter regimes .",
    "we also emphasize the stringent edm constraints on combined sources of @xmath4- and flavour - violation in more general models .",
    "finally , we conclude in section  5 with an outlook on future experimental and theoretical developments .",
    "the majority of edm experiments are performed with matter as opposed to anti - matter .",
    "therefore , the conclusion about the relation between @xmath8 and @xmath4 violation relies on the validity of the @xmath13 theorem .",
    "the interaction @xmath24 for a spin 1/2 particle then has the following relativistic generalization [ relativ ] h_t , p - odd = - d * e * = -d ^_5 f_. parenthetically , it is worth remarking that the precision of edm experiments has now reached a level sufficient to provide competetive tests of @xmath13 invariance , since one can also consider a @xmath4-even , but @xmath13-odd , relativisitic form of @xmath24 , namely @xmath25 , with a preferred frame @xmath26 , which spontaneously breaks lorentz invariance and @xmath13 .",
    "the problem of calculating an observable edm from the underlying @xmath4 violation in a given particle physics model can be conveniently separated into different stages , depending on the characteristic energy / momentum scales . at each step",
    "the result can be expressed as an effective lagrangian in terms of the light degrees of freedom with wilson coefficients that encode information about @xmath4 violation at higher energy scales . as usual in effective field theory , it is convenient to classify all possible effective @xmath4 violating operators in terms of their dimension , with the operators of lowest dimension usually leading to the largest contributions .",
    "this logic may need to be refined if symmetry requirements imply that certain operators are effectively of higher dimension than naive counting would suggest .",
    "this is actually the case for certain edm operators due to gauge invariance , as discussed in more detail below .",
    "we will present this analysis systematically in order of increasing energy scale , working our way upwards in the dependency tree outlined in fig .  1 , which allows us to remain entirely model - independent until the final step where some high - scale model of @xmath4 violation can be imposed and then subjected to edm constraints .    a schematic plot of the hierarchy of scales between the cp - odd sources and three generic classes of observable edms .",
    "the dashed lines indicate generically weaker dependencies.,width=377 ]      let us begin by reviewing the lowest level in this construction , namely the precise relations between observable edms and the relevant @xmath4-odd operators at the nuclear scale . at leading order",
    ", such effects may be quantified in terms of edms of the constituent nucleons , @xmath21 and @xmath27 ( where the neutron edm is already an observable ) , the edm of the electron @xmath28 , and @xmath4-odd electron - nucleon and nucleon - nucleon interactions . in the relevant channels",
    "these latter interactions are dominated by pion exchange , and thus we must also consider the @xmath4-odd pion - nucleon couplings @xmath29 which can be induced by @xmath4-odd interactions between quarks and gluons . to be more explicit ,",
    "we write down the relevant @xmath4-odd terms at the nuclear scale , _",

    "the dependence of the observable edms on the corresponding wilson coefficients relies on atomic and nuclear many - body calculations which would go beyond the scope of this review to cover here ( see the reviews @xcite for further details ) .",
    "however , we will briefly summarize the current status of these calculations , before turning to our major focus which is the calculation of these coefficients in terms of higher scale @xmath4-odd sources .    as alluded to earlier on",
    ", it is convenient to split the discussion into three parts , corresponding roughly to the three classes of observable edms which currently provide constraints at a similar level of precision ; namely : edms of paramagnetic atoms and molecules , edms of diamagnetic atoms , and the neutron edm .",
    "@xmath31 _ edms of paramagnetic atoms  thallium edm _",
    "paramagnetic systems , namely those with one unpaired electron , are primarily sensitive to the edm of this electron . at the nonrelativistic level , this is far from obvious due to the schiff shielding theorem which implies , since the atom is neutral , that any applied electric field will be shielded and so an edm of the unpaired electron will not induce an atomic edm . fortunately , this theorem is violated by relativistic effects .",
    "in fact , it is violated strongly for atoms with a large atomic number , and even more strongly in molecules which can be polarised by the applied field . for atoms , the parameteric enhancement of the electron edm",
    "is given by @xcite , d_para(d_e ) ~10 d_e , up to numerical @xmath32 factors , with @xmath33 the angular momentum and @xmath34 the atomic number .",
    "this enhancement is significant , and for large @xmath34 , the applied field can be enhanced be a factor of a few hundred within the atom .",
    "this feature explains why atomic systems provide such a powerful probe of the electron edm , since the `` effective '' electric field can be much larger than one could actually produce in the lab .",
    "although the electron edm is the predominant contributor to any paramagnetic edm is most models , one should bear in mind that other contributions may also be significant in certain regimes . in particular , significant @xmath4-odd electron - nucleon couplings may also be generated , due for example to @xmath4 violation in the higgs sector . among these couplings , @xmath35 plays by far the most important role for paramagnetic edms because it couples to the spin of the electron and is enhanced by the large nucleon number in heavy atoms .    among various paramagnetic systems ,",
    "the edm of the thallium atom currently provides the best constraints on fundamental @xmath4 violation . a number of atomic calculations @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a more complete list ) have established the relation between the edm of thallium , @xmath28 , and the cp - odd electron - nucleon interactions @xmath35 : d_tl = -585 d_e - e  43  gev ( c_s^(0 ) - 0.2 c_s^(1 ) ) .",
    "[ dtl ] with @xmath35 expressed in isospin components .",
    "the relevant atomic matrix elements are known to within @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "as we discuss later on , current experimental work is focussing on the use of paramagnetic molecules , e.g. ybf and pbo @xcite , which can provide an even larger enhancement of the applied field due to polarization effects , have better systematics , and may bring significant progress in measuring / constraining @xmath28 and @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath31 _ edms of diamagnetic atoms  mercury edm _",
    "edms of diamagnetic atoms , i.e. atoms with total electron angular momentum equal to zero , also provide an important test of @xmath4 violation @xcite .",
    "in such systems the schiff shielding argument again holds to leading order .",
    "however , in this case it is violated not by relativistic effects but by finite size effects , namely a net misalignment between the distribution of charge and edm ( i.e. first and second moments ) in the nucleus of a large atom ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) . however , in contrast to the paramagnetic case , this is a rather subtle effect and the induced atomic edm is considerably suppressed relative to the underlying edm of the nucleus .    to leading order in an expansion around the point - like approximation for the nucleus , the contributions arise from an octopole moment ( which is only relevant for states with large spin , and will not be relevant for the cases considered here ) , and the schiff moment @xmath37 , which contributes to the electrostatic potential , v_e = 4 ( ) .",
    "@xmath4-odd nuclear moments , such as @xmath37 , can arise from intrinsic edms of the constituent nucleons and also @xmath4-odd nucleon interactions .",
    "it turns out that the latter source tends to dominate in diamagnetic atoms and thus , since such interactions are predominantly due to pion exchange , we can ascribe the leading contribution to @xmath4-odd pion nucleon couplings @xmath38 for @xmath39 corresponding to the isospin .",
    "there are of course various additional contributions , which are generically subleading , but may become important in certain models .",
    "schematically , we can represent the edm in the form d_dia = d_dia(s[|g_nn , d_n],c_s , c_p , c_t , d_e ) , where we note that electron - nucleon interactions may also be significant , as is the electron edm itself @xcite ( although in practice the electron edm tends to be more strongly constrained by limits from paramagentic systems and thus is often neglected ) .",
    "currently , the strongest constraint in the diamagnetic sector comes from the bound on the edm of mercury  at the atomic level , this is in fact the most precise edm bound in existence . as should be apparent from the above discussion , computing the dependence of @xmath23 on the underlying @xmath4-odd sources is a nontrivial problem requiring input from qcd and nuclear and atomic physics .",
    "in particular , the computation of @xmath40 is a nontrivial nuclear many - body problem , and has recently been reanalyzed with the result @xcite , s(^199hg ) = -0.0004 g|g^(0 ) -0.055 g|g^(1)+ 0.009 g|g^(2 ) e^3 , where @xmath41 is the @xmath4-even pion - nucleon coupling , and @xmath42 denote the @xmath4-odd couplings .",
    "the isoscalar and isotensor couplings have been significantly reduced relative to previous estimates , while the isovector coupling  which generically turns out to be most important  has been less affected ( within a factor 2 ) .",
    "this nonethless provides some indication of the difficulties inherent in the calculation , and makes precision estimates more difficult .",
    "moreover , it is worth noting that the suppression of the overall coefficient in front of @xmath43 below @xmath44 is the result of mutual cancellation between several contributions of comparable size , and therefore is in some sense accidental and may not hold in future refinements of these nuclear calculations .    putting the pieces together ,",
    "we can write the mercury edm in the form , d_hg & = & -(1.8 10 ^ -4 gev^-1 ) e|g_nn^(1 ) + 10 ^ -2 d_e + & & + ( 3.510 ^ -3 gev ) e c_s^(0 ) , where we have limited attention to the isovector pion - nucleon coupling and @xmath35 which turns out to be the most important for @xmath4 violation in supersymmetric models .",
    "@xmath31 _ neutron edm _",
    "the final class to consider is that of the neutron itself , whose edm can be searched for directly with ultracold neutron technology , and currently provides one of the strongest constraints on new @xmath4-violating physics . in this case , there is clearly no additonal atomic or nuclear physics to deal with , and we must turn directly to the next level in energy scale , namely the use of qcd to compute the dependence of @xmath21 on @xmath4-odd sources at the quark - gluon level .",
    "this statement also applies to many of the other quantities we have introduced thus far , including in particular the @xmath4-odd pion - nucleon coupling .",
    "indeed , it is only paramagnetic systems that are partially immune to qcd effects , although even there we have noted the possible relevance of electron - nucleon interactions .",
    "the effective cp - odd flavour - diagonal lagrangian normalized at 1 gev , which is taken to be the lowest perturbative quark / gluon scale , plays a special role in edm calculations . at this scale , all particles other than the @xmath45 and @xmath46 quark fields , gluons , photons ,",

    "in fact , in most models these operators are really dimension - six operators in disguise .",
    "the reason is that , if we proceed in energy above the electroweak scale and assume the system restores su(2)@xmath54 as in the standard model , gauge invariance ensures that these operators must include a higgs field insertion @xcite .",

    "in practice , this feature can also be understood in most models by going to a chiral basis , where we see that these operators connect left- and right - handed fermions , and thus require a chirality flip .",
    "this is usually supplied by an insertion of the fermion mass , i.e. @xmath63 , again implying that the operators are effectively of dimension six .",
    "consequently , for consistency we should also proceed at least to dimension six where we encounter the @xmath4-odd three - gluon weinberg operator and a host of possible four - fermion interactions , @xmath64 , where @xmath65 denotes several possible scalar or tensor lorentz structures and/or gauge structures , which are contracted between the two bilinears .",

    "the quadratic dependence of the vacuum energy on @xmath47 , since its determined effectively by a two - point function , implies that generic @xmath4-odd observables will inherit a leading linear dependence on @xmath47 . in particular ,",
    "although we will discuss a more detailed calculation in the next section , we can obtain a similar order of magnitude estimate for the neutron edm , d_n ~e ~|(6 10 ^ -17 )  e cm , where we identified @xmath79 and used conventional values for the light quark masses .",

    "to some extent , these two possibilities can also be motivated by two extreme reference points , namely when @xmath81 is either fully rotated to sit in front of @xmath48 , or to manifest itself as an overall phase of the quark mass matrix .",

    "an aspect of the axion mechanism that is perhaps not stressed as often as it should be is that there can be other contributions to the axion potential which shift its minimum away from @xmath94 @xcite . in particular",

    "an example of this type is the quark chromoelectric dipole moment , @xmath96 , appearing in ( [ manyedms ] ) .",

    "the size of this _ induced _ contribution to @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath97 , is linearly related to the coefficient of the @xmath4-odd operator @xmath95 generating @xmath98 .",
    "these effects therefore need to be taken into account in computing the observable consequences of @xmath4-odd sources in axion scenarios , and will be important for us later on .    before moving on ,",
    "it is worth recalling that , were it realized , the simplest solution to the strong @xmath4 problem would fall into the class we are discussing , namely the possibility that @xmath99 in the standard model lagrangian normalized at a high scale @xmath100 , or more generically , det@xmath101 . in this situation",
    ", the lagrangian already possesses the appropriate chiral symmetry without the addition of extra fields and , as we have discussed , @xmath102 then becomes unphysical .",
    "since the identification of light quark masses is indirect , using meson and baryon spectra and chiral perturbation theory , the possibility that @xmath99 has been debated at length in the literature @xcite , but is strongly disfavoured by conventional chiral perturbation theory analysis , with recent results implying @xmath103 @xcite , and this conclusion is beginning to be backed up by unquenched ( but chirally extrapolated ) lattice simulations which suggest similar values , @xmath104 @xcite .      another way to approach the strong @xmath4 problem is to assume that either @xmath2 or @xmath4 or both are exact symmetries of nature at some high - energy scale .",
    "then one can declare that @xmath106 be zero at this high scale as a result of symmetry .",
    "of course , to account for the parity- and @xmath4-violation observed in the sm , one has to assume that these symmetries are spontaneously broken at a particular scale @xmath107 .",
    "the model building problem that this sets up ",
    "one which has been made particularly manifest by the consistency of the recently observed @xmath4-violation in @xmath18-meson decays with the km mechanism  is that one needs to ensure that the subsequent corrections to @xmath14 are small , while still allowing for an order one km phase .",
    "symmetry breaking at @xmath107 may generate the @xmath14-term at tree level through e.g. imaginary corrections to the quark mass matrices @xmath108 and @xmath109 , | ~(m_u m_d)+[thind ] where such corrections could affect either the yukawa couplings @xmath110 or the higgs vacuum expectation values , @xmath111 ( in the sm @xmath112 ) , while the ellipsis denotes the phases of other coloured fermions . for comparison ,",
    "the sm ckm - type phase ( in basis - invariant form ) is @xcite _ km ~,[ckmphase ] and one is then led to consider models for flavour in which the second phase ( [ ckmphase ] ) can be large , as is required , while the first ( [ thind ] ) vanishes , or is at least highly suppressed .",
    "one class of models uses exact parity symmetry at some high - energy scale which implies @xmath113 reflection symmetry in the yukawa sector and thus hermitian yukawa matrices which do not contribute to @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "however , this necessitates the extension of the sm gauge group to incorporate @xmath114 , and the reality of @xmath111 comes as an additional constraint on the model which can be achieved _",
    "e.g. _ in its supersymmetric versions @xcite .",
    "one can instead just demand that @xmath4 be an exact symmetry at high scales , which is then broken spontaneously and @xmath4-violation enters via complex vacuum expectation values of additional scalar fields .",
    "models of this type can be constructed in which the mass matrices are complex , but have a real determinant @xcite , although often it is difficult to obtain a sufficiently large ckm phase .",
    "an interesting recent suggestion for getting round this problem is to use low - scale supersymmetry breaking @xcite ( see also earlier ideas @xcite ) , while @xmath4 is broken spontaneously at a much higher scale where susy is still exact .",
    "strong interactions in the @xmath4-breaking sector can then generate a large ckm phase , while a susy nonrenormalization theorem ensures that @xmath47 is not generated until the much lower scale where susy is broken .",
    "all models of the type discussed above , that attempt to solve the strong @xmath4 problem by postulating exact parity or @xmath4 at high scales , have to cope with the very tight bound on @xmath80 .",
    "indeed , it is not enough to obtain @xmath82 at tree level , as loop effects at and below @xmath115 can lead to a substantial renormalization of the @xmath14-term ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if the effective theory reduces to the sm below the scale @xmath115 , the residual _ low - scale _ corrections to the @xmath14-term can only come via the kobayashi - maskawa phase and the resulting value for @xmath116 is small .",
    "however , this does not guarantee that the threshold corrections at @xmath115 are also small , as they will depend on different sources of @xmath4-violation and do not have to decouple in the limit of large @xmath115 .",
    "such corrections are necessarily model - dependent . however ,",
    "if the underlying theory is supersymmetric at the scale @xmath115 and the breaking of supersymmetry occurs at a lower scale @xmath117 , one expects the corrections to @xmath80 to be suppressed by power(s ) of the small ratio @xmath118 @xcite .    to summarize this section , we comment that the way the strong @xmath4 problem is resolved affects the issue of how large additional non - ckm @xmath4 violating sources can be .",
    "the axion solution , as well as @xmath99 , generically allows for the presence of _ arbitrarily _ large @xmath4 violating sources above a certain energy scale .",
    "this scale is determined by comparison of higher - dimension @xmath4-odd operators ( i.e. dim@xmath119 ) induced by these sources with the current edm constraints . on the contrary",
    ", models using a discrete symmetry solution to the strong @xmath4 problem usually have tight restrictions on the amount of additional @xmath4-violation even at higher scales in order to avoid potentially dangerous contributions to the @xmath14-term .",
    "having discussed the @xmath14-term in detail , we now take a more general approach and consider all the relevant operators up to dimension six in the @xmath4-odd lagrangian ( [ 456 ] ) , and move to the next level in energy scale in fig .  1 .",
    "to proceed , we need to determine the dependence of the nucleon edms , pion - nucleon couplings , etc . ,",
    "on these quark - gluon wilson coefficients normalized at 1 gev , i.e. & & d_n = d_n(| , d_i , d_i , w , c_ij ) , + & & |g_nn = |g_nn(| , d_q , w , c_ij ) , [ goal ] the systematic project of deducing this dependence was first initiated some 20 years ago by khriplovich and his collaborators , and is clearly a nontrivial task as it involves nonperturbative qcd physics .",
    "it is nonetheless crucial in terms of extracting constraints , and in particular one would like to do much better than order of magnitude estimates so that the different dependencies of the observable edms may best be utilized in constraining models for new physics .",
    "it is this problem that we will turn to next . in order to be concrete",
    ", we will limit our discussion to the nucleon edms and pion - nucleon couplings .",
    "the electron nucleon couplings , of which @xmath35 plays the most important role for the edm of paramagnetic atoms , receive contributions from the semi - leptonic four - fermion couplings @xmath120 in ( [ manydim6 ] ) , which may be determined straightforwardly using low - energy theorems for the matrix elements of quark bilinears in the nucleon ( see _ e.g. _ refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "before we delve into some of the details of these calculations , it is worth outlining a checklist of attributes against which we can compare the various techniques available for these calculations .",
    "we list below several features that such techniques would _ ideally _ possess :    * _ chiral invariance _ , including the relevant anomalous ward identities , provides a very strong contraint on the manner in which @xmath4-odd sources may lead to physical observables in the qcd sector . as an example",
    ", distributng @xmath121 arbitrarily between @xmath122 and @xmath123 can not alter the prediction for @xmath124 , and the answer must also depend on the correct combination of quark masses , namely the reduced mass @xmath76 .",
    "these symmetry constraints are therefore very powerful , and allow a consistency check of the qcd estimates .",
    "calculations are therefore more transparent if these constraints can be `` built in '' . * in addition to these chrial properties , the need to deal first of all with the tuning of @xmath47 means that ideally the procedure should also corrrectly account for additional contributions generated under pq relaxation .",
    "as argued in the previous section , the presence of @xmath4-odd operators can shift the position of the axion expectation value , leading to a new class of contributions , @xmath125 . more specifically ,",
    "this is the case for the cedm sources , the presence of which implies that @xmath81 must be substituted not by zero but by @xmath126 given by @xcite : _ ind = -_q = u , d , s , [ theta_ind ] independently of the specific details of the axion mechanism . here",
    "@xmath127 determines the strength of the following mixed quark - gluon condensate , g_s gq m_0 ^ 2q , [ m021 ] thus pq symmetry may lead to additional vacuum contributions to the edm . * in order to make consistent use of the edm constraints on fundamental @xmath4-odd phases , it would be desirable to have the _ same method _ available for obtaining estimates of @xmath21 and @xmath128 in terms of the relevant wilson coefficients .",
    "since different techniques have different sources of errors , use of the same method may allow a reduction in the uncertainty between the relative coefficients which , given a suite of different constraints , is ultimately more important then the overall uncertainty . *",
    "ideally , the method used should allow for a systematic _ estimate of the precision _ of the relevant qcd matrix elements , i.e. within a framework allowing for a treatment of higher order subleading corrections . *",
    "the generic dependence of @xmath129 on @xmath130 poses an additional challenge for obtaining precise results , through the poorly known values of the light quark masses , and their strong dependence on the qcd normalization scale .",
    "this uncertainty can be ameliorated given a method which generates answers which depend only on scale invariant combinations such as _ i.e. _ @xmath131 or @xmath132 .",
    "* for edms , the contribution of operators that are not suppressed by the light quark masses , @xmath133 and @xmath134 , is of considerable phenomenological interest .",
    "an ideal method would lead to a quantitative prediction for whether @xmath135 or @xmath136 can compete with the contributions of light quark edms and cedms .",
    "a well - known example in the @xmath137 channel suggests that this may indeed happen : i.e. @xmath138 , where @xmath139 .    since this is a nonperturbative qcd problem , the tools at our disposal",
    "are limited .",
    "ultimately , the lattice may provide the most systematic treatment , but for the moment we are limited to various appoximate methods and none that are currently available can satisfy all of the demands listed above , although we will argue that combining qcd sum - rules with chiral techniques can satisfy most of them . while one can make use of various models of the infrared regime of qcd , we prefer here to limit our discussion to three ( essentially ) model - independent approaches , which vary both in their level of qcd input , and in genericity as regards the calculations to which they may be applied .",
    "however , we will first recall what is perhaps the most widely used approach for estimating the contribution of quark edms to the edm of the neutron .",
    "this is the use of the su(6 ) quark model , wherein one associates a nonrelativistic wavefunction to the neutron which includes three constituent quarks and allows for the two spin states of each . obtaining the contribution of quark edms to @xmath21",
    "then amounts to evaluating the relevant clebsch - gordan coefficients and one finds , d_n(d_q)^qm = ( 4d_d - d_u ) .",
    "although one may raise many questions regarding the reliability , and expected precision , of this result , we will emphasize here only the significant disadvantage that this approach can not be used for a wider class of cp - odd sources , relevant to the generation of @xmath21 and @xmath29 .",
    "although historically not the first , conceptually the simplest approach is a form of qcd power - counting which goes under the rather unassuming name of `` naive dimensional analysis '' ( nda ) @xcite . this is a scheme for estimating the size of some induced operator by matching loop corrections to the tree level term at the specific scale where the interactions become strong . in practice , one uses a dimensionful scale @xmath140 characteristic of chiral symmetry breaking , and a dimensionless coupling @xmath141 to parametrize the coefficients .",
    "the claim is that , to within an order of magnitude , the dimensionless `` reduced coupling '' of an operator below the scale @xmath78 is given by the product of the reduced couplings of the operators in the effective lagrangian above @xmath78 which are required to generate it .",
    "the reduced couplings are determined by demanding that loop corrections match the tree level terms , and for the coefficient @xmath142 of an operator @xmath143 of dimension @xmath144 , containing @xmath71 fields , is given by @xmath145 . a crucial , and often rather delicate ,",
    "point is the precise scale at which one should perform this matching . within the quark sector , the identification of this scale with @xmath146 often seems to work quite well .",
    "however , for gluonic operators , the implied matching occurs at a very low scale where @xmath147 is very large , up to @xmath148 , and nda has proved more problematic in this sector .    to illustrate this approach ,",
    "let us consider the neutron edm induced by @xmath14 , in this case realized as an overall phase @xmath149 of the quark mass matrix , and also the edm and cedm of a light quark .",
    "the dimension five neutron edm operator has reduced coupling @xmath150 . above the scale",
    "@xmath78 we need the reduced couplings of the electromagnetic coupling of the quark , @xmath151 , and the @xmath4-odd quark mass term , @xmath152 . thus we find , d_n(_q , ) ~e _ q ( ) , where the @xmath153-dependence reflects the choice of matching scale . to obtain a similar estimate for the contribution of a light quark edm , we note simply that it has a reduced coupling given by @xmath154 and thus d_n(d_q , ) ~d_q ( ) , which can be contrasted with the quark model estimate above .",
    "the contribution of the quark cedm is similar , but one needs in addition the reduced electromagnetic coupling of the quark , @xmath151 , so that d_n(_q , ) = _ q ( ) , where we have redefined the cedm operator so that @xmath155 .",
    "this makes the factor @xmath147 explicit , which seems crucial to the success of nda for gluonic operators as the matching needs to be performed at a large value of @xmath147 , e.g. @xmath148 as noted above .",
    "these examples indicate on one hand the simplicity of this approach and also its general applicability , but also the fact that it does not easily allow one to combine different contributions into a single result for the neutron edm . in particular , these estimates have uncertain signs and thus can only be used independently with an assumption that the physics which generates them does not introduce any correlations .",
    "this will not generically be the case .      historically , the first model - independent calculation of the neutron edm @xcite made use of chiral techniques to isolate an infrared log - divergent contribution in the chiral limit ( for an earlier bag model estimate see @xcite ) .",
    "this was one of the landmark calculations which made the strong @xmath4 problem , and indeed the magnitude of the required tuning of @xmath14 , quite manifest .",
    "the basic observation was that , given a @xmath4-odd pion - nucleon coupling @xmath29 , one could generate a contribution to the neutron edm via a @xmath156-loop ( see fig .",
    "2 ) which was infarared divergent in the chiral limit . in reality",
    "this log - divergence is cut off by the finite pion mass , and one obtains , d_n^ = g_nn|g_nn^(0 ) , [ clog ] where @xmath157 is the relevant uv cutoff , i.e. @xmath158 or @xmath159 .",
    "one can argue that such a contribution can not be systematically cancelled by other , infrared finite , pieces and thus the bound one obtains on @xmath160 in this way is reliable in real - world qcd .",
    "this reduces the problem to one of computing the relevant @xmath4-odd pion - nucleon couplings . for a given @xmath4-odd source @xmath161 , we have n ^a | o_cp |n^= n| [ o_cp , j^a_05 ] |n^+ rescattering , [ start ] justified by the small @xmath162-channel pion momentum .",
    "the possible rescattering corrections will be discussed below .",
    "if we now specialize to the @xmath14-term , as in @xcite , with @xmath163 then the commutator reduces to the triplet nucleon sigma term , and we find |g^(0)_nn(_q ) = p |",
    "|q^3 q |p ( 1- ) . [ gpinnscalar ] one can then determine @xmath164 from lattice calculations or , as was done in @xcite , by using global su(3 ) symmetry to relate it to measured splittings in the baryon octet .",
    "the final factor on the right hand side of ( [ gpinnscalar ] ) reflects the vanishing of the result in the limit that the chiral anomaly switches off and @xmath165 ( or @xmath15 in the three - flavour case ) is a genuine goldtone mode .",
    "this factor is numerically close to one and was ignored in @xcite .",
    "it arises because in ( [ start ] ) we should also take into account the fact that the @xmath4-odd mass term can produce @xmath165 from the vacuum and thus , in addition to the pcac commutator , there are rescattering graphs with @xmath165 produced from the vacuum and then coupling to the nucleon , and the soft pion radiated via the @xmath4-even pion - nucleon coupling @xcite .",
    "although this technique is not universally applicable , one can also contemplate computing the contribution of certain other sources , e.g. the quark cedms .",
    "using the same pcac - type reduction of the pion in @xmath166 as in ( [ start ] ) , one can reduce the calculation of @xmath128 to the matrix elements of dimension five @xmath4-even operators . in doing this",
    ", one has to take into account a subtlety for cedm sources , first pointed out in @xcite , namely that a second class of contributions , the pion - pole diagrams ( fig .",
    "3b ) , now contribute at the same order in chiral perturbation theory . in an alternative but",
    "physically equivalent approach , one can perform a chiral rotation in the lagrangian to set @xmath167 , thus making this additional source of @xmath4-violation explicit at the level of the lagrangian @xcite .",
    "after this consistent pcac reduction of the pion , the intermediate result for @xmath29 takes the following form , @xmath168 the second line in this expression contains the same matrix element as ( [ gpinnscalar ] ) , and vanishes when pq symmetry sets the axion minimum to @xmath126 ( [ theta_ind ] ) .",
    "the remaining terms are proportional to the following combination , n| q g_s gq - m_0 ^ 2 q |n , [ thisiswhatweneed ] which unfortunately _ can not _ be estimated using chiral techniques , and requires genuine qcd input .",
    "a naive vacuum saturation hypothesis in ( [ thisiswhatweneed ] ) leads to the vanishing of this expression .",
    "this is a rather fundamental problem which limits the precision of various approaches , _",
    "e.g. _ those based on the use of low energy theorems to estimate ( [ thisiswhatweneed ] ) @xcite , to obtain the dependence of @xmath29 on the cedms .",
    "this limited applicability is one problem that currently afflicts the chiral approach .",
    "a more profound issue is that the terms enhanced by the chiral log , while conceptually distinct , are not necessarily numerically dominant .",
    "indeed there are infrared finite corrections to ( [ clog ] ) which , while clearly subleading for @xmath169 , are not obviously so in the physical regime .",
    "this dependence on threshold corrections has been observed to provide a considerable source of uncertainty @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative to considering the chiral regime directly , is to first start at high energies , making use of the operator product expansion , and attempt to construct qcd sum rules @xcite for the nucleon edms , or the @xmath4-odd pion nucleon couplings .",
    "this approach in principle allows for a systematic treatment of all the sources , and is motivated in part by the success of such approaches to the calculation of baryon masses @xcite and magnetic moments @xcite . for a recent review of some aspects of the application of qcd sum rules to nucleons , see _",

    "a borel transform can be applied to suppress the contribution of excited states .",
    "however , a well - known complication @xcite of baryon sum rules in external fields is that the single pole terms , corresponding to transitions between the neutron and excited states , are not exponentially suppressed by the borel transform and thus provide the leading contribution from the excited states , with a coefficient which is not sign definite .",

    "the presence of both scalar and pseudoscalar couplings @xmath279 and @xmath280 breaks @xmath4 invariance .    assuming that the scalar mass @xmath100 is large , we integrate this field out and match the resulting coefficients with the wilson coefficients listed in ( [ manyedms ] ) and ( [ manydim6 ] ) . in particular , at tree level , we obtain the following contribution to ( [ en ] ) , c_s^(0 ) z_e ( 3(y_d + y_u ) + y_s+ ) , [ cij ] where the ellipsis stands for the contribution of heavy quark flavours , and the couplings are normalized at 1 gev .",
    "if we now make the assumption that there is no correlation with other sources of @xmath4 violation , e.g. the electron edm @xmath28 , then with the use of the experimental constraint on @xmath22 and the results of atomic claculations ( [ dtl ] ) , we arrive at the following limit on the @xmath4-odd combination of couplings and the mass @xmath100 , z_e ( y_d + y_u + 0.3y_s ) .",
    "given the most optimistic assumption about the possible size of these couplings , i.e. @xmath281 , we can conclude that the current experimental edm sensitivity translates to a bound on @xmath100 as high as @xmath282 gev .",
    "if instead we insert the largest kobayashi - maskawa prediction for the tl edm of order @xmath283 cm in place of the current sensitivity , we obtain @xmath284 gev , as the ulmitate scale which can be probed via these dimension 6 operators before the onset of the `` km background '' .    for comparison , allowing for arbitrarily large flavour - violating couplings of @xmath277 to fermions , we can also deduce the sensitivity level to new flavour physics ( nfp ) in a similar way .",
    "for example , requiring that four - fermion operators that change flavour by two units , e.g. @xmath285 and the like , do not introduce new contributions to @xmath286 , @xmath287 and @xmath288 that are larger than the sm contribution , one typically finds that @xmath289 gev in this scenario .",

    "( [ 131 ] ) that we should emphasize here : @xmath397 can be non - zero even if @xmath398 , and both im@xmath399 and @xmath400 are enhanced relative to ( [ oneloopth ] ) and ( [ simple_d ] ) by the large ratio @xmath401 , which can compensate the suppression associated with flavour violation . in the case of @xmath213 quark operators ,",
    "this enhancement factor is even larger , @xmath402 .",
    "as we have seen in the previous subsection , renormalization of @xmath403im@xmath404 can be very large , capable of producing bounds on @xmath396 and @xmath405 at the @xmath406 level or better unless @xmath80 is removed via pq symmetry . in the latter case , using ( [ 131 ] ) and similar results in the lepton sector , one obtains the following sensitivity of edms to the above combination of flavour changing transitions on electron , @xmath213 , and @xmath8 quark lines for @xmath407tev , ^e_131~10",
    "^ -4 - 10 ^ -3 ;  ^u_131~10 ^ -6 - 10 ^ -5 ;  ^d_131~10 ^ -4 - 10 ^ -3 .",
    "[ fl_constr ] thus , edms independently provide very stringent constraints on the combined sources of flavour- and @xmath4-violation in the soft - breaking sector .",
    "these constraints are complementary to those coming from @xmath267 and @xmath18 meson physics and searches for lepton flavour violation .",
    "note also that these calculations need to be modified in the large @xmath253 regime to include higgs - mediated contributions @xcite which may dominate over the one - loop results for @xmath240 ( [ flavourresults ] ) .",
    "it is important to realize that the apparent enhancement of edms in ( [ 131 ] ) by the ratios of heavy to light quark and lepton masses occurred because of the presence of flavour - changing terms in _ both _ @xmath393 and @xmath394 sectors of the squark / slepton mass matrices . indeed , to make this point transparent",
    "we can write _ 131^d = arg[(_13^d)_ll(_33^d)_lr(_31^d)_rr ] , in terms of `` mass insertions '' @xcite @xmath408 , which , although the distinction is not crucial here , are usually defined in a slightly different basis to the one we have been using .",
    "@xmath409 denotes here the average sfermion mass - squared .",
    "the status of the @xmath393 and @xmath394 insertions is in general rather different , and particularly so within the mssm where the latter are essentially absent .    to see this in more detail",
    ", we recall that flavour - changing terms in the @xmath393 sector are natural , as they are induced by renormalization group evolution of the soft - breaking parameters ( see e.g. @xcite ) even if one assumes the conditions ( [ prop ] ) at the unification scale",
    ". starting from the universal boundary conditions ( [ prop ] ) for all scalar masses , equal to @xmath127 , and @xmath188 parameters at some high - energy scale @xmath410 , one can obtain an expression for @xmath411 at a lower energy scale @xmath19 , which at one - loop is given by _ q^2 = m_0 ^ 2   * 1 * - ( ) ( * y*_u^_u + * y*_d^_d)+[yy ] the ellipsis denotes `` flavour - blind '' contributions and also higher - order terms .",
    "depending on the particular model of susy breaking @xmath410 can be anywhere between a few tens of tev and the planck scale .",
    "the presence of _ both _ up and down yukawa matrices in ( [ yy ] ) guarantees the appearence of flavour - changing contributions in the @xmath393 entries of the squark mass matrices . at the superpartner threshold , @xmath412 , the flavour changing terms in the down squark sector will evidently be m^2_dij - ( ) y_t^2 v_ti^ * v_tj , where @xmath269 is the ckm matrix , and @xmath413 is the top quark yukawa coupling .",
    "if the scale @xmath410 is very high , i.e. comparable to the planck or gut scale , the logarithm is large and can entirely offset the loop factor .",
    "therefore , the natural size of the 13 entry in the down squark @xmath393 sector is @xmath414 .",
    "the situation in the @xmath394 sector is completely different . there",
    "the absence of any @xmath299-dependence in the rg equations for @xmath415 forbids the generation of substantial flavour - changing transitions , unless the mssm spectrum is modified above certain energies so that the rg equations for the right - handed squark masses aquire flavour dependence .",
    "a number of susy scenarios have been proposed which describe plausible patterns of small deviations from ( [ prop ] ) , allowing for significant @xmath394 contributions . in models with so(10 )",
    "unification and @xmath416 the running of the soft - breaking parameters extends _ above _ the unification scale , where the rg equations are modified by the presence of new field degrees of freedom . for so(10 ) guts this modification introduces significant flavour dependence in the @xmath394 sector of squark and slepton mass matrices @xcite , even if the restrictions ( [ prop ] ) are imposed at the planck scale .",
    "the resulting flavour - changing terms for down squarks @xmath417 are of the same order of magnitude as in the @xmath393 sector , leading to the prediction @xmath418 , which is right at the border - line of current experimental sensitivity ( [ fl_constr ] ) , @xcite .",
    "similar effects may be generated by heavy sterile neutrinos .",
    "the light neutrino mass scale might , via the seesaw mechanism , be pointing to the existence of a new energy scale , @xmath419 related to heavy sterile ( or `` right - handed '' ) neutrinos . if @xmath410 is larger than @xmath420 , the rg equations for sleptons will be modified above @xmath420 with an effect similar to that above , namely a non - trivial flavour dependence will be imprinted on the slepton mass matrices .",
    "the importance of such an effect will depend on the size of the neutrino yukawa couplings @xmath421 and , with certain yukawa patterns , an observable or nearly - observable electron edm might be induced @xcite . of course , if the scale of susy breaking is lower than @xmath420 ( or @xmath422 ) there are no significant consequences for edms unless one allows for other `` diagonal '' phases in this sector .",
    "recent years have seen significant progress in the experimental tests of @xmath4-violation in the standard model .",
    "experimental verification of direct @xmath4 violation in kaon decay , and in particular the spectacular measurements of @xmath4 asymmetries for neutral @xmath18 meson decays at babar and belle have provided solid confirmation of the overall validity of the kobayashi - maskawa mechanism .",
    "the current status of @xmath4 violation in flavour changing processes is such that ( within errors ) it does not necessitate the introduction of any additional @xmath4-violating sources . at the same time",
    ", there is ample ( experimental ) room for the existence of new @xmath4-violating physics to which the @xmath267 and @xmath18 meson data is not sensitive .",
    "this concerns , primarily , @xmath4 violation in flavour - conserving channels .",
    "the existence of such new sources is hinted at , albeit indirectly , by the baryon asymmetry in the universe . the search for @xmath4 violation in flavour - conserving channels , and the search for edms in particular ,",
    "should thus remain high on the priority list for particle physics .",
    "the strong suppression of edms induced purely by the kobayashi - maskawa phase , combined with prospects for improving the experimental sensitivity , places edm searches at the forefront in probing @xmath4-violating physics beyond the standard model .",
    "moreover , beyond their direct sensitivity , current ( and future ) null results for edm searches also provide very powerful constraints on models for new physics .",
    "indeed , as we have discussed , the sensitivity for example to @xmath4 violation in the soft - breaking sector of susy models , allows us to probe soft - breaking masses as large as a few tev . in this indirect sense ,",
    "edms are often sensitive to energy scales beyond the reach of future collider experiments , and play a central role in the full suite of precision tests of the standard model .",
    "the scales probed by edms and by the constraints on flavour changing neutral currents are not too dis - similar , and the gap may continue to narrow with future progress in edm searches .",
    "this only heightens the tension between the observed @xmath4-violation in the flavour - changing sector and the lack thereof in flavour - diagonal channels , of which the strong @xmath4 problem is the most manifest example .",
    "we seem compelled to question whether @xmath4 and flavour are as intrinisically linked in general as they are within the kobayashi - maskawa model ?",
    "this is one aspect of what one might hope would be answered by a general `` theory of flavour '' .",
    "edms will clearly continue to provide a crucial probe in tackling this question .    in this concluding section",
    "we would like to emphasize some directions on the experimental and theoretical front that are likely to bring future progress in establishing the nature of flavourless @xmath4-violation at and above the electroweak scale .",
    "there are a number of developments in experimental techniques to search for edms which promise to narrow the gap between the current limits and the km background in all of the edm classes discussed in this review .",
    "in particular , novel techniques for storing neutrons in liquid helium , in progress at lansce in los alamos @xcite and under investigation for an experiment at psi , will help to improve the measurement of many fundamantal parameters in neutron physics , including @xmath21 . on another front , the suggestion that @xmath4-violating effects can be significantly enhanced in exotic nuclei possessing an octopole moment @xcite drives several experiments searching for edms of isotopes of ra and rn @xcite .",
    "we note that such experiments should be pursued primarily because of their potential to discover @xmath4 violation , as null results will not be as constraining as those from @xmath423 or @xmath23 due to large uncertainties in the calculations of nuclear matrix elements . in future measurements of paramagnetic edms",
    ", the resulting sensitivity to @xmath28 and @xmath35 will be significantly improved via the use of paramagnetic molecules , such as ybf and pbo , that can be polarized and thus allow a huge enhancement of the applied field @xcite .",
    "the anticipated precision will allow probes of the electron edm down to @xmath424 cm or below @xcite . in this regard",
    ", we should mention an interesting alternative approach , which involves the measurement of the tiny electron edm - induced magnetic flux when an electric field is applied to a particular garnet crystal .",
    "this project is also already in development at lansce @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most interesting proposal of recent years is the new approach to measure the edms of _ charged _ particles in storage rings .",
    "an initial proposal to measure the muon edm at the @xmath425 cm level @xcite has since evolved into the idea to measure the edms of ions and nuclei @xcite , and in particular the deuteron edm at the @xmath426 cm level .",
    "although clearly not a diamagnetic system , the deuteron edm can be placed in the same category as it is primarily sensitive to the same nuclear scale @xmath4-violating source , namely the @xmath4-odd pion - nucleon couplings @xmath29 .",
    "more precisely , one finds @xcite , d_d = ( d_n + d_p ) - ( 1.3 0.3  gev^-1 ) e |g_nn^(1 ) , [ dd ] where the second term generically dominates , leading to a similar dependence on @xmath4-odd sources as for mercury . however , in comparison to mercury , the deuteron edm proposal has the significant advantage of requiring only straightforward nuclear calculations , since it is a weakly bound state , which leads to the relatively precise dependence on @xmath427 in ( [ dd ] ) . using the result ( [ goneres ] ) for @xmath427 , and accounting for the subleading corrections , one obtains @xcite d_d 6^+11_-3 e ( _ d - _ d ) + o(_d + _ u , d_u , d_d ) .",
    "thus a measurement of @xmath428 at the @xmath429 cm level would correspond to a sensitivity to light quark cedms at the level of @xmath430 cm @xcite , which is at least two orders of magnitude better than the current limits from @xmath23 . above all else , these proposals to measure edms in storange rings deserve special considerations as they depart from the dominant philosophy that edm measurements demand the study of neutral objects in parallel electric and magnetic fields .",
    "to place this activity in context , we should bear in mind that probably the most important single question for particle physics  the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking  will be subjected to serious experimental scrutiny with the large hadron collider coming on line within a few years .",
    "besides the discovery of the higgs boson(s ) , it may provide an answer to the gauge hierarchy problem , and indeed uncover a plethora of new particles or resonances above the electroweak scale .",
    "edm experiments , which might of course discover new physics before the lhc switches on , can subsequently play a complementary role in providing constraints on ( or signatures of ) @xmath4-violating couplings ( e.g. in the higgs sector of the mssm ) .",
    "the projected level of sensitivity in coming years will be more than competetive in this regard with collider probes .",
    "moreover , strangely enough , the absence of new physics ( beyond the higgs  or whatever might play this role ) at the tev scale would not remove motivations for edm searches .",
    "indeed , as we argued in this review , edms are sensitive to @xmath4 violation at multi - tev scales , and thus represent one of the few classes of low - energy precision measurements that are sensitive to such high - energy scales .    another important experimental direction relevant to @xmath4-violating physics",
    "is the search for axions .",
    "as we reviewed , one of the more natural resolutions of the strong @xmath4 problem predicts the existence of a light pseudo - scalar particle , the axion .",
    "the developments of recent years in cosmology have lent considerable weight to the presence of a non - baryonic cold dark matter component of the energy density in the universe .",
    "although the popularity of supersymmetric models continues to focus attention on the lightest supersymmetric particle ( or lsp ) as a natural dark matter candidate at the weak scale , axions with a coupling @xmath431 below its astrophysical bound in fact still represent a viable alternative , thus providing additional motivation for the continuation of axion searches .      on the theoretical side , beyond questions of the precise generation mechanisms of @xmath4-odd sources in specific new physics models ,",
    "it is clear that the primary limitation on the full application of the observational bounds arises through the limited precision of qcd and nuclear calculations .",
    "perhaps the most afflicted quantity at present is the @xmath4-odd pion - nucleon constant , as induced in particular by the cedms of light quarks .",
    "as we have discussed , this is a fundamental parameter controlling the level of the constraints imposed by diamagnetic atoms , which can currently be calculated only to limited precision due to large cancellations in the relevant nucleon matrix elements .",
    "another important issue concerns the strange quark cedm contribution both to @xmath128 and the neutron edm @xmath21 , and whether or not it is underestimated in the leading - order sum - rules analysis @xcite .",
    "it would clearly be worthwhile to revisit these aspects .",
    "however , it seems likely that significant quantitative progress will come only from _ ab initio _ lattice calculations .",
    "this is a very challenging task , since a viable lattice calculation would necessarily have to respect chiral symmetry both at the level of quarks and gluons and also among the observable matrix elements between the hadronic states , since this is the underlying reason for the suppression of @xmath237 by @xmath76 and the partial suppression of @xmath432 .",
    "to that end , it will be important to implement a calculation displaying all the required symmetries , and in this sense @xmath237 would be a good place to start , as many features of the answer , such as the dependence on @xmath76 and on @xmath433 , are enforced by symmetry allowing for independent checks of the calculation .",
    "on the nuclear side , we noted that recent reanalyses of the schiff moment indicate that various many - body effects , e.g. polarization , can be significant and thus further progress in this area would assist significantly in improving the quality of constraints on @xmath434 in different isospin channels .",
    "it will also be important , in guiding future experimental ideas , to clarify the size of the enhancement of @xmath4 violation in exotic nuclei with octupole deformations .    in conclusion , the limits on flavour - diagonal @xmath4-violation produced by the null results of existing edm searches already provide strong constraints on new physics at and above the electroweak scale .",
    "developments in coming years promise to provide us with a wealth of new information about the nature of @xmath4 violation and tev - scale physics , complementary to studies of electroweak symmetry breaking at colliders and flavour studies with @xmath267 and @xmath18 mesons .",
