    "multiparticle azimuthal correlations are nowadays utilized regularly in anisotropic flow analysis by all major collaborations worldwide which are analyzing heavy - ion data . in",
    "@xcite they were introduced in their present form into the experimental heavy - ion physics as an improvement over the standard event plane method  @xcite and the two - particle correlation techniques  @xcite after if was realized that both of them are severely biased by contributions from unwanted sources of correlations typically involving only a few particles .",
    "such contributions in general are not related to correlations which originate from the collective nature of anisotropic flow , which typically involve all produced particles .",
    "a great deal of effort has been invested in the last fifteen years in developing the technology to enable efficient and exact evaluation of multiparticle azimuthal correlations , which would be free from trivial ( yet dominant ) contributions from autocorrelations .",
    "for this reason the sophisticated and efficient formalism of generating functions was proposed in  @xcite . however , despite its initial success it was eventually realized that this formalism is non - exact and limited in scope only to certain types of multiparticle correlations .",
    "recently the generic framework was developed in  @xcite which enables exact and efficient evaluation of any multiparticle azimuthal correlation ( for a detailed historical account on the development and usage of multiparticle azimuthal correlations in anisotropic flow analysis we refer to the introductory part of  @xcite ) .",
    "although widely used , very little is known about the statistical properties of multiparticle azimuthal correlations beyond their first moments . in this technical paper we therefore initiate the work which attempts to fill in this gap in the literature  the derivation of higher order moments and the derivation of the analytic expressions for the probability density functions ( p.d.f.s ) of multiparticle azimuthal correlations .",
    "if the anisotropic flow is the only source of correlations among produced particles and is quantified in the standard way , namely in terms of flow harmonics @xmath2 and symmetry planes @xmath3 which appear as two distinct degrees of freedom in a fourier series expansion of anisotropic distribution of produced particles in momentum space  @xcite , then the following analytic expression , derived first in  @xcite , follows for the first moments of multiparticle azimuthal correlations : @xmath4 in the above relation by @xmath5 we have denoted the generic @xmath6-particle azimuthal correlation evaluated in harmonics @xmath7 ( for a detailed definition and further discussion see  @xcite ) . the key point in the derivation of result ( [ eq : mixedharmonicsexpversion ] ) was the assumption that the collective anisotropic flow is the only source of correlations between produced particles .",
    "this assumption implies that a joint @xmath8-variate p.d.f . ,",
    "@xmath9 , will factorize into the product of @xmath8 single - particle marginalized p.d.f.s @xmath10 , @xmath11 : @xmath12 where @xmath13 labels the azimuthal angles of produced particles . in this work",
    "we will always assume that the factorization ( [ eq : factorization ] ) is exactly satisfied and that the functional form of each individual p.d.f .",
    "@xmath10 is exactly the same  @xcite and is given by the fourier series  @xcite ( for this reason , we will frequently use the terminology _ fourier - like _ p.d.f . in this paper ) .    of particular interest are isotropic multiparticle azimuthal correlations , for which @xmath14  @xcite , evaluated in a single harmonic @xmath8 ( i.e. in addition @xmath15 holds for any @xmath16 ) . for such specific correlations any dependence on symmetry planes",
    "@xmath17 cancels out in ( [ eq : mixedharmonicsexpversion ] ) and therefore one can use the first algebraic moment of @xmath6-particle azimuthal correlation to estimate directly the @xmath6th algebraic moment of the flow harmonic @xmath2 ( to be denoted by @xmath18 $ ] or @xmath19 ) .",
    "these higher order moments @xmath19 are particularly important in the study of physical processes which govern event - by - event flow fluctuations , when each higher order moment by definition provides an independent information on the underlying p.d.f . of flow fluctuations .",
    "for a recent theoretical review on flow fluctuations we refer to  @xcite , while for a recent review of the experimental results on flow fluctuations we refer to  @xcite . finally , we remark that none of the first moments of isotropic single - harmonic multiparticle azimuthal correlations can be used to estimate directly the very first moment of @xmath2 , i.e. its mean value @xmath20 .",
    "the mean value for instance can be estimated directly in a completely different approach which does not rely on correlation techniques and was published recently in  @xcite , or via the unfolding methods  @xcite .",
    "in general , the factorization ( [ eq : factorization ] ) will break down due to the presence of correlations which are involving only a few particles and all of which are commonly referred to as _ nonflow_. in such a case multiparticle azimuthal correlations will be systematically biased by contributions from nonflow and are not reliable estimators of the anisotropic flow properties .",
    "the further improvement in this context came with multiparticle cumulants .",
    "in the way they were originally deployed into the anisotropic flow analysis  @xcite , the higher order multiparticle cumulants were intended to be systematically less sensitive to unwanted nonflow correlations than the lower order ones . in this work",
    "we assume that nonflow is absent and that the factorization ( [ eq : factorization ] ) holds exactly , while the systematical biases in multiparticle azimuthal correlations due to nonflow will be addressed in our subsequent work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "s : on_the_road_towards_the_p.d.f . ]",
    "we motivate our work , define all observables of interest , present and discuss our main results and indicate the future directions of this project .",
    "our main results are the analytic expressions for the p.d.f.s of the real and imaginary parts of single - particle @xmath1-vectors and the analytic expressions for the characteristic functions of the real and imaginary parts of @xmath0-particle @xmath1-vectors , where @xmath0 is the total number of particles in an event .",
    "these results were obtained for the most general case of multichromatic anisotropic flow and without invoking the central limit theorem .",
    "the former results can be expressed solely in terms of chebyshev polynomials of the first kind , while the latter ones can be expressed solely in terms of bessel functions of the first kind . in section  [",
    "s : higher_order_moments ] we present the analytic results for the higher order moments of the real and imaginary parts of @xmath0-particle @xmath1-vectors , and utilize them to calculate higher order moments of isotropic multiparticle azimuthal correlations of interest .",
    "these results are used in the discussion on sensitivity of correlation techniques which shall be useful in the design considerations of the future detectors aiming at anisotropic flow measurements with multiparticle azimuthal correlations . in each appendix",
    "we provide self - contained materials with all technical steps detailed which were omitted in the derivation of the results presented in the main part of paper .",
    "one of the most important observables in the experimental anisotropic flow analysis is the @xmath1-vector ( sometimes also called the flow vector )  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1-vector evaluated in harmonic @xmath8 is a complex number which is defined for a set of @xmath0 particles as : @xmath21 where @xmath22 labels the azimuthal angle of @xmath23th particle . in this work",
    "we will make a notable difference between the _ @xmath0-particle _ @xmath1-vector defined above , and _ single - particle _ or _ unit _",
    "@xmath1-vector evaluated in harmonic @xmath8 , which is denoted by @xmath24 and defined as : @xmath25 depending on the context , the @xmath0-particle or the single - particle @xmath1-vector can be the more suitable observable to work with .",
    "the physical interpretation of @xmath0-particle @xmath1-vector is the following  if a set of @xmath0 azimuthal angles can define a mean or preferred direction in azimuth , than that direction can not be estimated navely by a sample mean @xmath26 , but is instead estimated with the direction in which @xmath0-particle @xmath1-vector points to  @xcite . for completeness sake , we also outline the definition of @xmath27 , which is called the _ reduced _ @xmath1-vector and defined as : @xmath28 the reduced @xmath1-vector is less sensitive to the biases originating from multiplicity fluctuations and is a particularly suitable observable for the event - shape engineering , which is a newly emerging field of research in heavy - ion collisions gaining a lot of attention of late  @xcite .    in the present work we will utilize @xmath1-vectors because of the following remarkable property :",
    "all multiparticle azimuthal correlations can be expressed analytically in terms of @xmath0-particle @xmath1-vectors evaluated ( in general ) in different harmonics  @xcite .",
    "this realization was a major recent breakthrough which eventually led to the exact and efficient evaluation of all multiparticle azimuthal correlations .",
    "the key point is that only a single pass over the data suffices to calculate the @xmath1-vectors defined in ( [ eq : qvector ] ) for in principle any number of different harmonics @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , the evaluation of analytic expressions which relate multiparticle azimuthal correlations with @xmath1-vectors require as well only a single pass over the data .",
    "such analytic equations were published for a few selected and most widely used azimuthal correlations in  @xcite , while the general answer was provided recently in  @xcite . taking everything into account , we conclude that in order to narrow down the statistical properties of multiparticle azimuthal correlations we are naturally led in the first step towards the study of statistical properties of their fundamental building blocks , the @xmath1-vectors .",
    "this is the main subject of the current paper .",
    "approximate p.d.f.s , usually derived under the assumption of central limit theorem and under the assumption that only one anisotropic flow harmonic is non - negligible , for various observables which are sensitive to anisotropic flow are already available in the literature .",
    "for instance , it was shown in  @xcite that the bessel - gaussian p.d.f . to leading order",
    "describes distribution of the modulus of reduced @xmath1-vector defined in ( [ eq : qvectorreduced ] ) .",
    "recently , power - law and elliptic - power p.d.f.s were studied in  @xcite which describe the distributions of eccentricities calculated from initial anisotropies in coordinate space . for the calculation of moments of initial anisotropies in the glauber approach",
    "we refer to  @xcite , the characterization of initial conditions with bessel - fourier expansion can be found in  @xcite , while for an alternative characterization with cumulant expansion we refer to  @xcite . for an overview of experimental results in this context ,",
    "we refer to the recent review  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we take an alternative route .",
    "our starting random observable is the azimuthal angle @xmath13 whose sample space is the interval @xmath29 and whose p.d.f .",
    "is given by : @xmath30\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : fourier_cn_sn}\\ ] ] we have found it more convenient in the following calculations to parametrize fourier - like p.d.f . with @xmath31 and @xmath32 harmonics instead of with amplitudes @xmath2 and symmetry planes ( phases ) @xmath3 , as has become customary in the field .",
    "the parametrization can be trivially changed by using relations @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "any multiparticle azimuthal correlation can be considered as a multivariate function of @xmath0 azimuthal angles @xmath35 , where @xmath0 is the total number of particles in an event . under the assumptions outlined in the introduction , the joint multivariate p.d.f .",
    "of @xmath0 azimuthal angles @xmath13 factorizes into the product of @xmath0 single particle p.d.f.s , the functional form each of which is given by the relation ( [ eq : fourier_cn_sn ] ) above .",
    "the problem of finding p.d.f . of multiparticle azimuthal correlation is therefore at its core equivalent to the problem of finding p.d.f .",
    "@xmath36 of a function @xmath37 of a starting random observable @xmath38 whose sample space @xmath39 and the p.d.f .",
    "@xmath40 are already known . from the conservation of probability it follows  @xcite : @xmath41 the above result , however , can not be applied directly in the cases which were encountered in this project .",
    "the reason for a limited direct applicability of result ( [ eq : conservationofprobability_mainpart ] ) lies in the fact that modifications and generalizations are required for the cases when both @xmath37 and @xmath40 are piecewise - defined functions , as well as for the case when @xmath37 does nt have a unique inverse .",
    "we have therefore , in appendix  [ app : distributions_of_functions_of_random_observables ] , provided self - contained material which generalizes the result ( [ eq : conservationofprobability_mainpart ] ) and we have illustrated in a detailed toy monte carlo example how this generalization can be utilized in practice .    by using the general procedure established in appendix  [ app : distributions_of_functions_of_random_observables ] for finding the p.d.f . of a function of random observable with known p.d.f .",

    "<S> we introduce a general procedure to pave the road towards the ultimate goal of deriving analytic expressions for the probability density functions ( p.d.f.s ) of multiparticle azimuthal correlations . </S>",
    "<S> all multiparticle azimuthal correlators can be expressed analytically in terms of the real and imaginary parts of @xmath0-particle @xmath1-vectors . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the analytic results for the p.d.f.s of single - particle @xmath1-vectors in the most general case and demonstrate that they can be expressed solely in terms of chebyshev polynomials of the first kind . </S>",
    "<S> this leads analytically to the expressions of the characteristic functions of @xmath0-particle @xmath1-vectors in terms of bessel functions of the first kind . from the obtained characteristics functions we calculate the higher order moments of the real and imaginary parts of @xmath0-particle @xmath1-vectors and use them to obtain the higher order moments of multiparticle azimuthal correlators </S>",
    "<S> finally , these results are used to investigate the sensitivity of multiparticle azimuthal correlations and to illuminate requirements necessary for future anisotropic flow measurements . </S>"
