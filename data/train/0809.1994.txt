    "we consider the tree - level vertex functional by including all the required external sources necessary for the functional formulation of the relevant symmetries of the theory and for the symmetric subtraction of the divergences .    the local functional equation ( lfe ) @xcite , which fixes the 1-pi amplitudes involving at least one goldstone boson ( descendant amplitudes ) in terms of goldstone - independent 1-pi amplitudes ( ancestor amplitudes ) , provides a hierarchy among 1-pi green functions .",
    "once the ancestor amplitudes have been subtracted , the lfe uniquely fixes the descendant amplitudes .",
    "the lfe holds together with the slavnov - taylor ( st ) identity , which guarantees the fulfillment of physical unitarity @xcite , and the landau gauge equation ( lge ) , which encodes the stability of the landau gauge - fixing under radiative corrections .    in the present paper",
    "the hierarchy is obtained by using the lfe and a set of external sources that ought to be complete in order to obtain all the descendant amplitudes .",
