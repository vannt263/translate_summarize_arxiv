    "an ever increasing amount of evidence indicates the existence of large amounts of dark matter in the universe @xcite . despite this overwhelming evidence ,",
    "the exact nature of the dark matter remains a mystery .",
    "numerous candidates have been proposed , including both baryonic and nonbaryonic matter @xcite .",
    "observations reveal that some of the dark matter in the galactic halo is baryonic , consisting of macho s @xcite ; however , present data indicates that macho s can not account for all of the dark matter implied by the galactic rotation curve @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a number of arguments based upon large scale motions in the universe and large scale structure formation indicate that @xmath10 , which is far in excess of the bounds on @xmath11 arising from cosmic nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "all considerations point toward non - baryonic matter comprising a sizable fraction of the universal density .",
    "if this is true , what is the dark matter ?    among the best motivated , and hence highly favored , of the nonbaryonic dark matter candidates is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) .",
    "experimental and theoretical considerations indicate that the lsp is a neutralino , @xmath5 , consisting of a linear combination of the supersymmetric partners of the photon ( @xmath12 ) , the z ( @xmath13 ) , and 2 higgs bosons ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) .",
    "note that the @xmath12 and @xmath13 are themselves linear combinations of the supersymmetric partners of the neutral w ( @xmath16 ) and b ( @xmath17 ) bosons , hence the neutralino composition is typically written as @xmath18 the motivation for supersymmetry ( susy ) arises naturally in modern theories of particle physics @xcite , although the nu s potential as a dark matter candidate was not realized until later @xcite . for a very large region of susy parameter space ,",
    "neutralinos provide densities that are in accord with the measured value of @xmath19 , thus explaining the dark matter .",
    "the is also detectable in at least two ways : indirectly , through the products of @xmath20annihilation in the sun , earth , and galactic halo @xcite , or directly , via elastic ( and inelastic @xcite ) neutralino - nucleus ( 2 ) scattering in a detector @xcite . in either case , the elastic scattering cross section is an essential ingredient . in this paper",
    "we discuss nuclear structure calculations relevant to scattering for several nuclei which are primary constituents of many current and planned direct detection experiments @xcite .",
    "physics at three distinct energy scales governs scattering .",
    "the composition and mass of the nu , and hence its interaction with quarks are fixed near the electroweak scale .",
    "the interaction of neutralinos with protons and neutrons is determined by the quark distribution ( both spin and density ) within the nucleon , which is determined at the qcd scale . at the modest momentum transfers available to dark matter",
    "neutralinos the interacts with the entire nucleus , not individual nucleons within it .",
    "thus , nuclear structure plays an important role in determining the cross section .",
    "the uncertainties in the electroweak scale physics ( the susy part of the problem ) are typically handled by considering large sweeps through susy parameter space @xcite .",
    "the qcd scale physics is currently the focus of much study and the relevant nucleon matrix elements continue to be measured with high precision @xcite .",
    "the necessary nuclear physics is not measurable for most nuclei but is amenable to calculation through a variety of methods .",
    "here we apply the nuclear shell model to the nuclei i127 , 129 , 31x , 125 , and 23 ( this last nucleus we discuss in an appendix ) in order to provide a consistent and correct set of nuclear input physics for determining the cross section .",
    "the scattering cross section has two distinct terms : a spin - independent , or _",
    "scalar _ , term , and a spin - dependent , or _",
    "axial _ term .",
    "it has been well established that for nuclei with @xmath2150 ( @xmath22 number of nucleons ) , the scalar piece of the interaction tends to dominate the scattering rate ; however , there are significant regions of parameter space where this is not so and the axial rate dominates @xcite .",
    "the importance of understanding the axial interaction is amply demonstrated by a recent susy interpretation of a fermilab scattering event @xcite .",
    "these papers claim that the might be an almost pure higgsino whose couplings to ordinary matter are completely dominated by the axial part . in this paper , we shall deal with the axial interaction .",
    "the relevant nuclear physics for the scalar interaction is well approximated by a fairly simple form factor , suitable for all nuclei@xcite .",
    "the axial response is far more complicated and requires detailed nuclear models .",
    "a variety of nuclear models have been used to calculate the axial response of nuclei used as targets in dark matter detectors . the conventional nuclear shell model @xcite",
    "has proven highly successful at accurately representing this response when a reasonable nuclear hamiltonian is used in a sufficiently large model space @xcite . until recently ,",
    "both of these ingredients have been absent for nuclei in the @xmath23 shell , including most of those included in this study . with recent advances in computer power and storage",
    ", we can now construct model spaces that contain most of the nuclear configurations that are likely to dominate the spin response of nuclei such as i127 . coupled with this ability to perform sufficiently large calculations",
    "is the recent development of several realistic nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath24 ) potentials @xcite .",
    "these potentials can then be converted into suitable nuclear interaction hamiltonians via the g - matrix / folded diagram technique @xcite . in this paper we consider two such nuclear interactions , one using the bonn a @xcite and the other the nijmegen ii @xcite @xmath24 potential .",
    "the diagonalization of the hamiltonian was performed using the shell model code antoine @xcite .",
    "the residual nuclear interaction based upon the bonn a potential has been described in ref .",
    "this hamiltonian has been derived for the model space consisting of the @xmath25 and @xmath26 orbitals ( which we use in this study ) .",
    "it was originally derived to describe light sn isotopes ( @xmath27110 ) which have no protons in the space . in order to find good agreement with observables for nuclei with @xmath28",
    ", the single particle energies ( spes ) were adjusted .",
    "we made an initial guess at the spes based upon the excited state energy spectra of nuclei with either a single neutron hole in the space ( @xmath7sn ) or a single proton in the space ( @xmath29sb and @xmath4sb ) .",
    "these initial spes were then used in conjunction with the two body matrix elements ( tbmes ) of the interaction to calculate observables for the nucleus i127 .",
    "we varied the spes until reasonable agreement between calculation and experiment was found for the following i127 observables : the magnetic moment ( @xmath30 ) , the low lying excited state energy spectrum , and the quadrupole moment ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "this procedure is similar to that performed in ref .",
    "the magnetic moment is extremely important , as it is the observable most closely related to the scattering matrix element and has traditionally been used as a benchmark of a calculation s accuracy . in fig .",
    "[ f : fig1 ] , we show the final spes used in our calculations . in table",
    "[ t : tab1 ] we show the final calculated values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 for i127 vs. the experimental values ; agreement is excellent .",
    "once the spes are specified , we have a reasonable hamiltonian to use for the nuclei we are studying .    in order to test the sensitivity of our results to the nuclear hamiltonian",
    ", we have also examined another one , derived from the nijmegen ii @xmath24 potential @xcite .",
    "we have used the codes and methods described in @xcite to convert the potential to a usable shell model interaction .",
    "the procedure is similar to that used for the bonn a force .",
    "the two sets of tbmes are generally similar but significant differences do exist .",
    "we initially used the same set of spes as above but found that a significant lowering of the @xmath32 spe was necessary in order to find agreement with the observables .",
    "the spes and comparisons with observables for this force are shown in fig .",
    "[ f : fig1 ] and tables  [ t : tab1 ] and [ t : tab2 ] .      to perform a full basis , positive parity , calculation of the i127 ground state properties in the space consisting of the @xmath25 and @xmath26 orbitals , we would need to have basis states consisting of roughly @xmath33 slater determinants ( sds ) .",
    "current , state of the art , calculations ( including those presented here ) can diagonalize matrices with basis dimensions in the range 12@xmath34 sds ; clearly severe truncations of the model space are needed .",
    "fortunately , given the size of the model spaces that can be treated , a truncation scheme that includes the majority of relevant configurations can be devised .",
    "our scheme is best understood by viewing fig .",
    "[ f : fig1 ] . as a base configuration",
    ", we have for protons : @xmath35 ( i.e. a total of 3 protons spread among the @xmath32 and @xmath36 orbitals ) and for neutrons : @xmath37 .",
    "we then assign the following values of the `` jump '' to each orbital : jump(@xmath38 ) = 0 , jump(@xmath39 ) = 1 , and jump(@xmath26 ) = 2 .",
    "the differences in these values is the cost of moving particles between the different ( sets of ) orbitals .",
    "hence , to move a proton from the @xmath32 to the @xmath36 costs nothing while moving one from the @xmath32 to the @xmath40 would cost 1 unit of jump ( to the @xmath26 would cost 2 units ) .",
    "it would cost 2 units of jump to move 2 neutrons from the @xmath41 to the @xmath26 , etc .... all that remains is to specify the total amount of jump available . in our truncation , we allow protons up to 3 units of jump , neutrons up to 4 units , and a total of up to 4 when adding the jump used by the protons plus neutrons . thus , if the protons remain in the @xmath32 and @xmath36 orbitals ( as they tend to do ) , the following neutron configurations are allowed : @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 . if 1 or 2 protons are excited out of the @xmath32 and @xmath36 orbitals ,",
    "the last 2 neutron configurations are not allowed . in this truncation ,",
    "the m - scheme dimension of the i127 model space is about 3 million sds .",
    "our results indicate that this space is more than adequate to describe the ground state properties of the nuclei considered .",
    "as mentioned above , our calculation of the observables agrees well with experiment .",
    "the major potential problem with this model space would be if it failed to allow enough neutron excitations into the @xmath26 orbital .",
    "it allows at most 8 neutrons out of a possible 12 in that orbital . in table",
    "[ t : tab3 ] we present the occupation numbers for i127 .",
    "we see that our interactions do not seem to prefer excitation of more than one extra neutron pair to the @xmath26 .",
    "most configurations have six neutrons in that orbital , while eight are allowed .",
    "hence , our model space is more than adequate .",
    "for the two xenon isotopes considered ( @xmath47 and 131 ) , we have used exactly this truncation scheme . for 125",
    "we used this scheme and also one where the total jump and total neutron jump was 6 ( instead of 4 ) .",
    "very little difference was noticed for the two truncations . in this paper",
    "we present the results for the larger truncation since it should be slightly more realistic .",
    "neutralinos in the halo of our galaxy are characterized by a mean virial velocity of , @xmath48 .",
    "the maximum characteristic momentum transfer in scattering is @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the reduced mass of the system .",
    "if the product @xmath51 is small ( @xmath52 ) , where @xmath53 is the nuclear size , the matrix element for spin - dependent scattering reduces to a very simple form @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the total nuclear spin operator , @xmath56 is a sum over all nucleons , and @xmath57 are nu - nucleon coupling constants which depend upon the quark spin - distribution within the nucleons and on the composition of the nu .",
    "much of the uncertainties arising from electroweak and qcd scale physics are encompassed by @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the normalization @xmath60 involves the coupling constants , masses of the exchanged bosons and various lsp mixing parameters that have no effect upon the nuclear matrix element .",
    "( 2 ) has often been written as @xmath61 with @xmath62 examples of the full cross section can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "equations ( 2 - 5 ) show that the couples to the spin carried by the protons and the neutrons . the matrix element ( 2 ) is similar to the magnetic moment operator : @xmath63 the _ free particle _",
    "@xmath64-factors are given by : @xmath65 , and @xmath66 ( in nuclear magnetons ) .",
    "given the similarities of eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 6 ) , it is no surprise that @xmath30 is often used as a benchmark on the accuracy of the calculation of and in @xmath67 .",
    "we follow that prescription as well . in the following section we will briefly outline some problems with this procedure .    in table",
    "[ t : tab2 ] we present the values for : , , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath30 that we calculate for each hamiltonian for the nuclei i127 , 129 , 31x , and 125 .",
    "we also include the experimentally measured magnetic moment , it is apparent that agreement is quite good for all nuclei .",
    "a number of other calculations of these quantities appear in the literature , and we include summaries of these calculations in the table as well .",
    "the following abbreviations are used for the various nuclear models : bonn a @xmath70 our calculation using the bonn a derived force , nijmegen ii @xmath70 our calculation using the nijmegen ii derived force , ogm @xmath70 the odd group model@xcite , ibfm @xmath70 the interacting boson fermion model @xcite , ispsm @xmath70 the independent single particle shell model @xcite , tffs @xmath70 the theory of finite fermi systems @xcite , and qtda @xmath70 the quasi tamm - dancoff approximation @xcite . in most previous experimental analyses ,",
    "the ogm values have been used  @xcite .",
    "examining our results for and in table  [ t : tab2 ] and comparing them to results from other nuclear models reveal several interesting facts . in almost every instance , our results show that the spin @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) carried by the unpaired nucleon is greater than that found in the other nuclear models ( except for the ispsm , where @xmath71 is maximal ) . despite our larger values for @xmath71 ,",
    "our calculations have significant quenching of the magnetic moment and are in good agreement with experiment in all cases ( see the later section on quenching ) .",
    "the reason that we find larger values of @xmath71 for the odd group is due to the fact that we allow more excitation of the even group of the nuclei ; allowing them to be a major contributor to the total nuclear spin : @xmath73 + + @xmath68 + @xmath69 .",
    "the naive expectation for @xmath69 in the bonn a calculation of i127 is zero .",
    "we find @xmath74 , @xmath69 is responsible for over 30% of iodine s total angular momentum ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "this explains both the large quenching of @xmath30 ( @xmath69 does not contribute to @xmath30 since @xmath76 ) and the large value of found .",
    "we note that most previous experimental analyses used the ogm value for i127 , = 0.07 .",
    "our results give a factor of @xmath77 increase in iodine s sensitivity to spin - dependent scattering over that previously assumed .",
    "due to the form factor suppression ( discussed below ) a sodium iodide detector s @xcite spin response is still dominated by 23 but not to the extent previously thought . for the remainder of the nuclei considered table  [ t : tab2 ] also reveals increased scattering sensitivity , although the factor of increase is much more modest .      as we noted earlier , the comparison of the computed magnetic moment vs. the experimental value has been used as the primary ( and in some cases , only ) indicator of a calculation s reliability .",
    "this seems quite reasonable in light of the similarities between the matrix elements in eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 6 ) .",
    "this prescription is not without several potential problems @xcite .",
    "not only does @xmath30 depend upon the orbital angular momentum @xmath78 but the spin angular momentum @xmath79 is subtly different .",
    "the matrix element ( 6 ) results from the non - relativistic reduction of the axial - vector current . because of this , it is not strongly affected by meson exchange currents ( mecs ) .",
    "the magnetic moment s spin operators , @xmath79 , are a result of the non - relativistic reduction of the vector current .",
    "they can be strongly affected by mecs @xcite .",
    "the effects of mecs upon @xmath30 is typically lumped together with several other effects to give effective @xmath64-factors @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , there is no hard and fast rule as to what effective @xmath64-factors are the best .",
    "we have chosen to remain with the free particle @xmath64-factors .",
    "as an example of the potential uncertainties this ambiguity leads to , we have also included , in table  [ t : tab2 ] , the calculated magnetic moment for our nuclei using a reasonable set of effective @xmath64-factors .",
    "the `` quenched '' magnetic moments are the values in parentheses in the table and the effective @xmath64-factors used are : @xmath80 , and @xmath81 .",
    "the table shows that these @xmath64-factors do little , overall , to improve the concordance between calculation and experiment .",
    "a related concern involves the quenching of the ( isovector ) gamow - teller ( gt ) @xmath64-factor , @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "the spin term of the gt operator also comes from the axial vector current and thus is closely related to the spin operators in eq .",
    "its is well established that most nuclear model calculations of gt strength require a reduction of @xmath82 of order 20% @xcite . whether this quenching of @xmath82 should also be applied to @xmath83 ( the isovector nu - nucleon coupling constant )",
    "is unknown @xcite .",
    "since there is no real guidance , and our magnetic moments agree well with experiment , we do not believe that any extra quenching of the spin matrix elements ( or equivalently the coupling constants @xmath84 and @xmath83 ) is desirable for these nuclei when calculating scattering rates . nonetheless , as pointed out in ref .  @xcite it is useful to keep these potential uncertainties in mind when calculating scattering rates .",
    "when the lsp was first proposed as a viable dark matter candidate , its preferred mass was between 5 and 10 gev @xcite . with a mass of this order and a typical galactic halo velocity ( @xmath85 ) ,",
    "the neutralino s total momentum ( @xmath86 ) was small compared to the inverse of the nuclear size ( @xmath87 ) and the zero momentum transfer limit was appropriate for studies of scattering .",
    "since then , experiments at accelerators have pushed the allowed mass , @xmath88 , to larger values ( there are ways around this if some of the theoretical assumptions are relaxed @xcite ) , and it has been shown that heavy nu s are just as viable as a dark matter candidate as the lighter ones@xcite . as @xmath88 becomes larger than a few 10 s of gev the product @xmath89 starts to become non - negligible and finite momentum transfer must be considered for heavier nuclei .",
    "the formalism for elastic scattering at all momentum transfers has been developed in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we follow precisely the definitions used in @xcite .",
    "it is a simple matter to go from our definitions to those used in ref .",
    "the formalism is a straight forward extension of that developed for the study of weak and electromagnetic semi - leptonic interactions in nuclei @xcite .",
    "the differential cross section is given by @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the spin structure function @xmath92 @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the transverse electric and longitudinal multipole projections of the axial - vector current operator @xcite .",
    "the double vertical lines imply that these are the reduced matrix elements of these operators . for their explicit form in the context ,",

    "we have used the codes from @xcite to calculate the actual wave functions . we have also calculated the bonn a structure function for i127 using harmonic oscillator wave functions .",
    "the differences in the two prescriptions are significant at very large momentum transfers but are minor at most relevant values of of the momentum transfer ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "it is useful ( and traditional ) to use the isospin convention instead of the proton - neutron formalism when discussing scattering at finite momentum transfer . writing the isoscalar coupling constant as @xmath98 and the corresponding isovector coupling constant as @xmath99 we may split @xmath91 into a pure isoscalar term , @xmath100 , a pure isovector term , @xmath101 , and an interference term , @xmath102 , in the following way : @xmath103 using this decomposition of @xmath91 it is a simple matter to derive the structure function for a of arbitrary composition .",

    "both of these nuclei are @xmath143 nuclei with an unpaired neutron . in the ispsm both of these nuclei",
    "would be represented by a neutron in the 3@xmath145 orbital and have virtually identical properties .",
    "table  [ t : tab2 ] shows that the magnetic moments are quite similar but that the distribution of the angular momentum in each nucleus is quite different .",
    "this is most obvious in the orbital angular momentum @xmath78 where the two distributions are quite different .",
    "[ f : fig6 ] reveals that while the structure functions have definite similarities , there are significant differences as well .",
    "we point all of this out to highlight the fact that seemingly very similar nuclei can have very different properties when examined in detail .",
    "if precise information on the spin distribution of a nucleus is required , detailed calculations must be performed .",
    "it is also useful to consider differences in @xmath91 that are the result of different nuclear models .",
    "@xmath91 has been calculated for 31x in the context of two other nuclear models , the qtda @xcite and the tffs @xcite , as well as here . in fig .",
    "[ f : fig7 ] we show @xmath91 for a pure @xmath17 as a function of @xmath146 for 31x .",
    "this figure is meant to be a direct analog of fig . 2 in ref .",
    "@xcite and fig . 3 of ref .",
    "examining the 3 figures yields some interesting conclusions .",
    "all three calculations show significant quenching compared to the single particle estimate .",
    "the spin distribution between the qtda and tffs is somewhat different while the full structure functions are quite similar .",
    "while the values for differ very little between our work and the qtda , the difference in the values of @xmath138 is almost a factor of 2 between the two calculations .",
    "finally , it should be noted that both the qtda and tffs calculations of @xmath91 asymptote to the single particle structure function .",
    "this is not the case in our calculations , which are well below the single particle estimate for all values of @xmath146 .",
    "this can also be seen in ref .",
    "@xcite where our values of @xmath147 for the bonn a calculation are compared to those of the qtda calculation . in that comparison , it is apparent that the shell model derived structure functions have a much steeper fall off as a function of @xmath146 .    finally , we mention the difference between the structure functions derived using wood - saxon wave functions vs. those derived using a harmonic oscillator basis . in fig .

    "[ f : fig5 ] we show the structure functions for i127 using both sets of basis states . significant differences between the two sets are apparent for extremely high momentum transfers but in the range that is most relevant for dark matter detection there is little difference .    in this section",
    "we have discussed the formalism of , and presented our results for , the axial structure function for several nuclei involved in dark matter detectors .",
    "accurate fits which are suitable for use in calculating event rates in detectors are presented in the appendices .",
    "several interesting features of the functions have been noted and it is apparent that no single simple parameterization of @xmath91 is suitable for all nuclei . finally we have compared our results to other calculations of 31x structure functions and noted several similarities and differences that arise from different nuclear models .",
    "in this paper we have calculated the full axial response for several heavy nuclei used in a number of direct dark matter detection experiments . with this set of structure functions , there now exists accurate calculations of the axial response to most , if not all , nuclei used as targets in dark matter detectors .",
    "we have used the largest model spaces practical in conjunction with realistic nuclear hamiltonians to construct our wave functions .",
    "two different nuclear hamiltonians have been used in order to investigate the sensitivity of our results to this particular input .",
    "the differences in the response due to the two forces is clearly visible in table  [ t : tab2 ] and figs .",
    "[ f : fig2][f : fig6 ] . in all cases ,",
    "reasonable agreement between calculation and experiment for the magnetic moment ( using free particle @xmath64-factors ) is achieved .",
    "it is obvious from the table that the differences between the two calculations are non - trivial but that they are quite a bit smaller than the differences coming from the use of alternate nuclear models .",
    "this shows that the interaction is not the primary uncertainty in calculations of the nuclear response .",
    "we have also attempted to examine the uncertainty due to the nuclear model chosen .",
    "a number of calculations of 31x s response have been performed .",
    "we find that our calculations are in reasonable agreement with other studies of the spin distribution and finite momentum response but distinct differences do exist . in the case of 31x",
    "it is not immediately obvious which calculation is to be preferred .",
    "the calculations presented here contain more excitations within the model space and use more modern and realistic nuclear interactions than the others in the literature . by restricting excitations within this model space ,",
    "the calculations presented in @xcite included excitations out of the space that we worked within .",
    "both calculations reproduce the magnetic moment well , with the qtda calculation doing slightly better .",
    "( we note that the qtda model , and a refined version of it , have been applied to i127 and was unable to reproduce the magnetic moment with sufficient accuracy  @xcite . )",
    "another improvement incorporated into these calculations of @xmath91 is the use of wood - saxon wave functions to evaluate the multipole operators in eq .",
    "the wood - saxon wave functions made a significant difference at extremely high momentum transfers when compared to the usual harmonic oscillator wave functions . at the more modest momentum transfers typical of `` average '' neutralinos",
    ", the difference is found to be small .",
    "now that these structure functions are available , we hope that they will be used by all experiments based upon the materials that we have studied",
    ". this will facilitate comparisons between different groups . to date , each experiment has used different structure functions in their analyses . a first step in this direction",
    "has already been taken by one group .",
    "the most recent analysis of the experiments based in the gran sasso laboratory uses the i127 and 129 structure functions presented here@xcite .",
    "we hope that other groups will follow suit so that all future results can be compared on equal footing .",
