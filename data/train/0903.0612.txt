    "when studying any quantum mechanical system , precise knowledge of its nature is crucially important . in quantum mechanics ,",
    "any observable phenomena can be explained rigorously , in principle , if we have complete knowledge of the system .",
    "more specifically , we need to identify the states of the system , and the hamiltonian that governs their dynamics . thus , the acquisition of all the relevant information on the states and hamiltonian is essential in understanding how nature behaves .",
    "the system of interest may include literally everything quantum mechanical , from high tc superconductors to microscopic structures in nanotechnology or even some highly complex processes in microbiology .",
    "the full information acquisition is , however , in general very hard from an operational as well as from a computational and mathematical point of view , even for small systems @xcite . for large many - body systems",
    "spectroscopy reveals only little information about the hamiltonian , and generally local addressing of its components is required in order to obtain details about the system .",
    "spins which can be controlled individually operate as a _ gateway _ , through which we can access and manipulate the system .",
    "a common dilemma is that such a gateway not only allows us to interact with the system , but also introduces noise to it . from a hamiltonian identification perspective",
    ", it is therefore crucial to find minimal gateways that suffice to obtain _ full _ knowledge on the system .",
    "while this is impossible to answer for generic systems , bounds can be derived if the topology of the system is known . in this context , some positive results have been presented for the case of 1-dimensional ( 1d ) chains of spin-1/2 particles @xcite .",
    "that is , the coupling strengths between neighboring spins can be estimated by accessing only the spin at the end of the chain .",
    "since schemes to initialize the state of spins as @xmath0 by operating on the chain end are known @xcite , such identification of the hamiltonian is sufficient to determine the dynamics of the system completely .",
    "these results are of interest in their own right , yet they were limited to the simplest of networks , i.e. , 1d chains .    in this paper , we suggest an estimation scheme for general graphs of spins . as well as the details of the hamiltonian identification procedure , we give a precise condition for the `` gateway '' ( accessible region ) that suffices to make the identification possible .",
    "for the important cases of finite 2d/3d lattices such a gateway is given by one edge or one face of the lattice , respectively .",
    "this is remarkable because the ratio between the gateway size and the unknown parameters is much higher than in the 1d case .",
    "we will also show that while in the 1d case the decay properties of the state in the gateway can identify the hamiltonian , in the 2d case we need its decay properties as well as the transport properties within the gateway .",
    "interestingly , our general condition turns out to coincide with the criterion for the controllability of spin networks @xcite .",
    "our results here thus indicate that hamiltonian - identifiable systems are quantum - controllable and vice versa .",
    "furthermore , they support the physical relevance of the topological properties discussed later .",
    "all _ coupling strengths ( black lines ) and local magnetic fields ( blue background ) of a 2-dimensional network @xmath1 of spins ( white circles ) can be estimated _ indirectly _ by quantum state tomography on a gateway @xmath2 ( enclosed by the dashed red line ) . the coupling strengths and field intensities are represented by the width of lines and the depth of the background color , respectively .",
    "the labeled spins @xmath3 and @xmath4 are used as examples in the proof of the main theorem . ]",
    "we will study a network with heisenberg - type interaction .",
    "this allows us to describe an estimation procedure that is numerically stable , mathematically simple , and efficient ( given that we consider arbitrary and large systems ) . what we attempt to estimate are the coupling strengths between interacting spins and the strengths of local magnetic fields .",
    "such inhomogeneous fields are very common in experiments , and can cause much trouble through dephasing . hence it is worthwhile estimating them ( such analysis was lacking in @xcite ) .",
    "another interesting new aspect we introduce in this paper is how to lift degeneracies on the system by applying extra fields on the gateway .",
    "we show that this is always possible , a result which might be relevant beyond the scope of estimation .",
    "our setup is an example of inverse problems that have been actively studied in plenty of fields in science and engineering",
    ". a classical counterpart among those problems that is closest to our quantum setting may be the estimation of spring constants in 1d harmonic oscillator chains @xcite .",
    "however , the resolution to this ( classical ) problem for generic graphs , even the 2d case , is still open",
    ". it would be intriguing if our results in a purely quantum setting could provide some clues to the analogous problem in classical settings .",
    "suppose that we have a network of spin-1/2 particles , such as the one in fig [ fig:2d ] .",
    "we assume that we have knowledge of the graph @xmath1 , which describes the network : nodes @xmath5 of the graph correspond to spins and edges @xmath6 connect spins that are interacting with each other .",
    "the pairwise interaction between spins is heisenberg type with a known anisotropy @xmath7 and there is an inhomogeneous magnetic field applied on the spins .",
    "then , the hamiltonian we consider has the form    @xmath8    where @xmath9 represent the _ unknown _ coupling strengths between spins @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and @xmath12 the _ unknown _ intensity of the magnetic field at @xmath11 , respectively . here",
    ", we also assume @xmath13 for all @xmath10 and @xmath11 , i.e. , ferromagnetic interactions , though the setup is readily generalized to other cases . in the above ,",
    "@xmath14 are the standard pauli matrices",
    ". the purpose of the following will be to estimate @xmath9 and @xmath12 over the entire set @xmath5 of spins by only accessing a small gateway , described by a subset @xmath15 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2d ] ) . for almost all practical cases of the hamiltonian identification problem , analyzing the dynamics in the _ single excitation sector _",
    "@xmath16 turns out to be sufficient .",
    "we will thus denote a single excitation state as @xmath17 when the spin @xmath18 is in the state @xmath19 and all others are in @xmath20 for clarity .",
    "the state with all spins in @xmath20 will be written as @xmath21    naturally , the nice challenge here is to obtain information about the inaccessible spins @xmath22 , which could be the large majority of the set .",
    "the question is however how small can the controlled @xmath2 be such that we can ( in principle ) still learn all the couplings and fields in @xmath23 intuitively the knowledge of the graph structure can be useful for making the estimation efficient .",
    "for instance , the smaller the number of non - vanishing couplings @xmath24 the more efficiently we can estimate them .",
    "however the efficiency should also depend on the structural property of the graph .    to answer this question ,",
    "we need to introduce a property , known as _ infecting , _ of a subset @xmath15 of the nodes  @xcite__. _ _ in many - body quantum mechanics this property has many interesting consequences on the controllability and on relaxation properties of the system  @xcite .",
    "the infection process can be described as follows .",
    "suppose that a subset @xmath2 of nodes of the graph is `` infected '' with some property .",
    "this property then spreads , infecting other nodes , by the following rule : an infected node infects a `` healthy '' ( non - infected ) neighbor if and only if it is its _ unique _ healthy neighbor .",
    "if eventually all nodes are infected , the initial set @xmath2 is called _ infecting_. the graph in fig .",
    "[ fig:2d ] is an example in which @xmath2 infects @xmath5 ( we encourage the reader to confirm this by coloring the nodes in region @xmath2 and applying the above propagation rule  this will make the following proof much more intuitive ) . with this definition",
    ", we can summarize the main result of the paper as the following    theorem : : :    _ assume that that @xmath2 infects @xmath25 then all    @xmath26 and @xmath12 can be obtained by acting    on @xmath2 only . _",
    "this theorem provides an upper bound on the smallest number of spins we need to access in order to perform hamiltonian tomography , i.e. given by the cardinality @xmath27 of the smallest set @xmath2 that infects @xmath25 to prove the above statement , we first present a lemma and its proof .",
    "lemma : : :    _ assume that @xmath2 infects @xmath5 and that all    eigenvalues @xmath28 @xmath29 ) in _",
    "@xmath16 _ are known .",
    "assume that for all    orthonormal eigenstates @xmath30 in _",
    "@xmath16 _ the coefficients    @xmath31 are known for all    @xmath32 then the @xmath26 and    @xmath12 are known .",
    "_    while the assumptions of the lemma may sound unrealistic , we will show later how they can be obtained by simple tomography experiments on @xmath33 _ _    proof  of  the  lemma : : :       we observe that the coupling strengths between spins _ within _ @xmath2",
    "are easily obtained because of the relation @xmath34 where we defined @xmath35 for the diagonal terms .",
    "since @xmath2 infects @xmath5 there is a @xmath36 and a @xmath37 such that @xmath4 is the only neighbor of @xmath3 outside of @xmath38 i.e. @xmath39 for an example see fig .",
    "[ fig:2d ] . using the eigenequation",

    "( [ eq : cmn ] ) , the left - hand side ( lhs ) is known for all @xmath44 this means that up to an unknown constant @xmath45 the expansion of @xmath46 in the basis @xmath30 is known . through normalization of @xmath47",
    "we then obtain @xmath48 and hence @xmath49 . redefining @xmath50",
    ", it follows by induction that all @xmath9 are known . finally , we have@xmath51 where @xmath52 stands for the ( directly connected ) neighborhood of @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the energy of the ground state @xmath55 .",
    "summing eq .",
    "( [ eq : magfield ] ) over all @xmath56 and using eq .",
    "( [ eq : e0 ] ) , we can have the value of @xmath57 , thus that of @xmath58 as well , since all other parameters are already known .",
    "then we obtain the strength of each local magnetic field , @xmath59 , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : magfield ] ) . @xmath60",
    "let us now describe how to obtain the information that is assumed to be known in the lemma .",
    "that is , we need to know the energy eigenvalues @xmath28 in @xmath16 and the coefficients @xmath31 for all @xmath61 by controlling / measuring the spins in @xmath2 .",
    "let us first consider the case where the eigenvalues in @xmath16 are non - degenerate .",
    "the general case will be described in section  [ sec : degeneracy - and - efficiency ] . to start the estimation",
    ", we initialize the system as @xmath62 as discussed in @xcite this can be done efficiently by acting on region @xmath2 only .",
    "then , we perform quantum state tomography on the spin @xmath61 after a time lapse @xmath63 . the entire state at @xmath63 is now@xmath64 where @xmath65 are the elements of the time evolution operator in the single excitation subspace . by repeating the preparation and tomographic measurements on spin @xmath11 for various times @xmath63 , we obtain the following matrix elements of the time evolution operator as a function of @xmath66 @xmath67 if we take @xmath68 and fourier transform eq .",
    "( [ eq : fourier ] ) we can get information on the energy spectrum of the hamiltonian in @xmath16 . up to an unknown constant @xmath58 , which will turn out to be irrelevant later , we learn the values of those @xmath28 corresponding to eigenstates that have non - zero overlap with @xmath69 we also obtain the values of @xmath70 for _ all _ eigenstates . due to the freedom in determining the overall phase of a state , we can assume that the coefficients for @xmath71 of all @xmath30 are real and positive , @xmath72 hence observing the _ decay / revival _ of an excitation at @xmath68 we can already learn some @xmath28 and all the @xmath73 .",
    "this is analogous to the @xmath74 case , where this knowledge would suffice to obtain the full hamiltonian @xcite .    in arbitrary graphs",
    "however this is no longer the case .",
    "in fact even if we observed the decay / revival at each @xmath61 we would only obtain the @xmath75 but could not determine their phase freely anymore . to obtain the required knowledge for the lemma , we need to observe the _ transport _ within @xmath33 this is represented by fourier transforming eq .",
    "( [ eq : fourier ] ) for @xmath76 allowing us to extract the coefficient @xmath31 correctly , including their relative phase with respect to @xmath73 .",
    "we also obtain those eigenvalues @xmath28 which have non - zero overlap with @xmath77 continuing this analysis over all elements of @xmath38 we learn all eigenvalues which have overlap with _ some _",
    "@xmath32 could there be eigenstates in @xmath16 which have no overlap with _",
    "any @xmath61 _ ? _ _ the answer is no , as it is shown in  @xcite .",
    "therefore we can conclude that all eigenvalues in the @xmath16 can be obtained .",
    "although tomography can not determine the extra phase shift @xmath78 it does not affect the estimation procedure .",
    "there are three equations that seem to require the explicit values of @xmath28 , namely eq .",
    "( [ eq : cmn ] ) for @xmath9 inside @xmath38 eq .",
    "( [ eq : main4estimation ] ) for @xmath79 and coefficients @xmath80 for a spin outside @xmath38 and eq .",
    "( [ eq : magfield ] ) for the magnetic fields .",
    "it is straightforward to see that for @xmath81 substituting @xmath82 into @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cmn ] ) gives the correct @xmath83 similarly , the invariance of eq .",
    "( [ eq : magfield ] ) is clear as it only depends on @xmath82 .",
    "less obvious is eq .",
    "( [ eq : main4estimation ] ) , however , the key is that the summation over @xmath84 contains the diagonal term @xmath85 then , by substituting @xmath82 into @xmath28 in the lhs of eq .",
    "( [ eq : main4estimation ] ) , it is straightforward to confirm that @xmath58 cancels out .",
    "therefore , the precise value of @xmath58 is not necessary for the hamiltonian identification .",
    "eventually , @xmath58 can be calculated by eq .",
    "( [ eq : e0 ] ) after having all @xmath9 and @xmath12 .",
    "the efficiency analysis of the hamiltonian tomography is roughly the same as in @xcite . due to the conservation of excitations",
    ", the sampling can be restricted to an effective @xmath86- dimensional hilbert space , and the speed is some polynomial in @xmath87 provided localization is negligible .",
    "one difference however is that in arbitrary graphs it might be less likely that the spectrum is non - degenerate .",
    "an explicit example can be given for a square lattice with equal coupling strengths , with the spectrum @xmath88 @xmath89 where the @xmath90 the @xmath74 energies of the corresponding chain .",
    "a uniform @xmath74 system on the other hand would typically be non - degenerate .",
    "of course exact degeneracy is highly unlikely ; however approximate degeneracy could make the scheme less efficient . here , we suggest to lift degeneracies by applying extra fields on the gateway @xmath33 since @xmath2 is only a small subset of the spin , it is not obvious at all that this is possible .",
    "we prove the following perhaps startling property of the infection property :    theorem : : :    _ assume that @xmath2 infects @xmath25 then there    exists an operator @xmath91 on @xmath2 that lifts    all degeneracies of @xmath92 in the single excitation    subspace . _ proof : : :       we will prove the above by explicitly constructing a @xmath91 that does the job",
    ". this @xmath91 will be very inefficient and even requires full knowledge of the hamiltonian , but is only introduced here for the sake of this proof .",
    "let us denote the eigenvalues of @xmath92 as @xmath90 and the eigenstates as @xmath93 where @xmath94 is a label for the @xmath95-fold degenerate states .",
    "let us first concentrate on one specific eigenspace @xmath96 corresponding to an eigenvalue @xmath97 since the eigenstates considered here are in the single excitation subspace , we can always decompose them as @xmath98 where we introduced the unnormalized states @xmath99 and @xmath100 in the single excitation subspace of @xmath2 and @xmath101 respectively . as shown in @xcite we know that @xmath102 .",
    "this is because if there was an eigenstate in the form of @xmath103 then applying @xmath92 repeatedly on it will necessarily introduce an excitation to the region @xmath38 in contradiction to being an eigenstate .",
    "in fact the set @xmath104 must be linearly independent : for , if it was linearly dependent , there would be complex numbers @xmath105 such that @xmath106 and because the eigenstates are degenerate , @xmath107 would be an eigenstate with no excitation in @xmath38 again contradicting ref .",
    "this leads to an interesting observation that the degeneracy of each eigenspace can be maximally @xmath108fold , because there can be only @xmath27 linearly independent vectors at most in the single excitation sector on @xmath33 thus minimal infecting set of a graph gives us some bounds on possible degeneracies .",
    "now we consider a hermitian perturbation @xmath109 ( to be specified later ) on the system and compute the shift in energies .",
    "we shall see that it suffices to assume that @xmath110 in first order , we need to compute the eigenvalues of the perturbation matrix @xmath111 can we find a @xmath112 such that all eigenvalues differ ?",
    "for that , note that @xmath113 are linearly independent , which means that there is a similarity transform @xmath114 ( not necessarily unitary , but invertible ) such that the vectors @xmath115 are orthonormal .",
    "the perturbation matrix can then be written as @xmath116 if we set @xmath117 we can see that the hermitian operator @xmath118 gives us energy shifts @xmath119 therefore , as long as we choose the @xmath120 mutually different from each other , the degeneracy in this eigenspace is lifted by @xmath121 this happens for an arbitrarily small perturbation @xmath122 we choose @xmath123 such that the lifting is large , but in a way such that _ no new degeneracies _ are created , i.e. @xmath124 where @xmath125 are the energy differences of @xmath126 however , the perturbation @xmath127 may well lift other degeneracies of @xmath92 `` by mistake '' . note that by construction @xmath112 conserves the number of excitations in the system ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : pert_matrix ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , we can now consider the perturbed hamiltonian @xmath128 and find its remaining degenerate eigenspaces in @xmath16 .",
    "naturally , the number of degeneracies with @xmath129 is less than that with @xmath92 . following the above procedure ,",
    "we pick one eigenspace and find an operator @xmath130 that lifts its degeneracy . keeping @xmath131 we continue to add perturbations , until we end up with a sum of perturbations that lift _ all _ degeneracies in @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath60    the above theorem demonstrates that degeneracies can in principle be lifted . in practice",
    ", we expect that almost all operators will lift the degeneracy , with a good candidate being an inhomogeneous magnetic field on @xmath33 one could even randomly choose operators on the gateway @xmath2 until the system shows no degeneracies .",
    "albeit being inefficient , our theorem shows that this strategy will eventually succeed .",
    "note also in the theorem it sufficed to consider operators within @xmath16 , i.e. @xmath132 with @xmath133 so maximally @xmath134 parameters need to be tested .",
    "for instance , if the system is a chain , @xmath135 necessarily corresponds to a magnetic field on spin @xmath136",
    "we have shown how a small gateway can efficiently be used to estimate a many - body heisenberg hamiltonian , given that the topology of the system is known .",
    "it is surprising to see how a simple topological property of a network of coupled spins - infection - implies so many far - reaching properties , from control to relaxation , from the structure of eigenstates to possible degeneracies , and , as we have shown here , for hamiltonian identification .",
    "our results can be seen as an example of inverse problems in quantum setting .",
    "it would be intriguing to explore a possible link between ours and similar problems in classical setting , such as 2d graphs of masses connected with springs .",
    "also , it would be interesting to study if the methods of @xcite , which does not require state preparation , can be applied to this setup .",
    "a further application could be found , for example , in estimating the hidden dynamics in an environment of an controllable system , such as a nanoscale device @xcite . of course",
    ", generalizing the present results to a wider class of many - body hamiltonian will be important from both theoretical and practical perspectives ."
