    "question [ question gaffney ] was asked by g.  ishikawa ( @xcite ) , and independently by t.  gaffney during ams spring western section meeting at the university of hawaii ( 2012 ) .",
    "it is easily seen that @xmath267 is non - singular , @xmath268 is the normal form of ( cusp)@xmath150 and @xmath269 is the normal form of ( swallowtail)@xmath44 .",
    "thus , in the case @xmath270 , proposition [ proposition 5 ] , theorem [ theorem 2 ] and theorem [ theorem 1 ] are the affirmative answers to question [ question gaffney ] respectively .",
    "therefore , question [ question gaffney ] asks essentially the case @xmath271 . even in this case , there is a criterion of legendrian @xmath255 singularities ( theorem [ a_k criterion ] ) .",
    "however , there seems to be no criteria for the @xmath43-equivalence class of @xmath263 @xmath272 .",
    "hence , it seems that we can not expect an analogy of the proof of theorem [ theorem 1 ] .",
