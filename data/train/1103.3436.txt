    "observations in the low - energy gamma - ray band from hundreds of kev to tens of mev provide a unique window on such phenomena as gamma - ray lines from nuclear de - excitation produced by nucleosynthesis in supernovae , e.g. , @xmath17ni , @xmath17co , and @xmath18ti @xcite ; gamma - ray lines from long - lived isotopes spread throughout our galaxy , such as @xmath19al and @xmath20fe @xcite ; electron  positron annihilation lines from the galactic center @xcite ; neutron capture lines from solar flares @xcite ; and gamma - ray resonant absorption along lines of sight toward gamma - ray bright quasars due to delta - resonance or giant dipole resonance @xcite .",
    "furthermore , radiation from black hole accretion disks has been detected @xcite , and radiation of neutral pions produced by ions accelerated in the strong gravitational potential of black holes is also expected to be detected @xcite .",
    "we can also observe nonthermal processes in low - energy gamma - rays : synchrotron radiation or inverse compton - scattered gamma rays in gamma - ray pulsars @xcite , active galactic nuclei ( agn ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "in addition , there are diffuse galactic gamma rays probably produced by bremsstrahlung and inverse compton scattering of electrons @xcite , and diffuse extragalactic gamma rays , which are thought to be a combination of emissions from agns and type ia supernovae @xcite or the combined emission from the comptonization process including nonthermal electrons in accretion disk coronae of agns @xcite .",
    "in addition , the measurement of photon polarization through low - energy gamma - ray observations from nonthermal processes , such as synchrotron radiation and compton scattering , would present a powerful diagnostic tool for astrophysics @xcite .",
    "however , observation of this low - energy gamma - ray band is difficult because of the following reasons : the dominant process in a detector is compton scattering and large backgrounds of photons are produced in the hadronic process between cosmic rays and a satellite body .",
    "therefore , mev gamma - ray astronomy has not advanced in comparison with x - ray or other gamma - ray bands .",
    "in fact , comptel onboard the compton gamma ray observatory ( _ cgro _ ) discovered only @xmath21 steady gamma - ray sources in the @xmath22@xmath23 mev band @xcite , whereas egret detected @xmath24 sources @xcite , and _ fermi _ found @xmath25 sources during the first 11 months of the all - sky survey @xcite in the sub - gev / gev region above @xmath5 mev .",
    "comptel , which was the first compton telescope onboard a satellite , localized the direction of an incident gamma ray on an event circle superposed on the sky by measuring the direction of a compton - scattered gamma ray and the energies of both the scattered gamma ray and a compton - recoil electron .",
    "after the launch , the sensitivity of comptel was found to be mainly determined not by diffuse cosmic gamma rays but by 1 ) locally produced background gamma rays ; 2 ) non - compton - scattering events such as multiple - photon events due to hadronic interaction , bremsstrahlung , or annihilation of positrons ; and 3 ) events due to other particles such as neutrons , even after effective background rejection by time - of - flight measurement between a compton scattering material and an absorber of the scattered gamma rays @xcite .",
    "comptel s limited sensitivity made it desirable to create a new instrument with a higher sensitivity in the sub - mev / mev region .",
    "therefore , we developed an electron - tracking compton camera ( etcc ) consisting of a three - dimensional tracker of compton - recoil electrons and an absorber of compton - scattered gamma rays by a new detection method with powerful background rejection @xcite . compared with comptel",
    ", the etcc can restrict the direction of an incident gamma ray to a reduced arc on the compton circle by measuring the three - dimensional track of the compton - recoil electron in addition to the energy of the compton - recoil electron and the energy and direction of the compton - scattered gamma ray .",
    "moreover , the angle between the direction of the scattered gamma ray and that of the compton - recoil electron can be used for powerful background rejection by checking the consistency between the measured and kinematically calculated values .",
    "the etcc can also detect the polarization of an incident gamma ray , because the azimuth angle distribution of compton scattering has an asymmetry for polarized gamma rays .",
    "because we had already confirmed the detection principle of the etcc by ground - based experiments @xcite , we initiated an experiment to observe sub - mev gamma rays from celestial objects by using a balloon - borne camera , the sub - mev gamma - ray imaging loaded - on - balloon experiment ( smile ) .",
    "for the first flight of smile ( hereafter smile - i ) , in order to study the background gamma rays for observations of celestial objects and verify the background rejection capability , we observed both atmospheric gamma rays , generated by the interaction between cosmic - ray particles and nuclei in the atmosphere , and diffuse cosmic gamma rays at an altitude of up to @xmath26 km @xcite .    since the 1960s ,",
    "several experiments have been conducted to observe diffuse cosmic gamma rays .",
    "the first detection was using the _ ranger 3 _ satellite between @xmath27 kev and @xmath28 mev in 1962 @xcite .",
    "thereafter , the existence of these rays was confirmed using the satellites _ ers-18 _ between @xmath29 and @xmath30 mev @xcite ,",
    "_ oso-3 _ between @xmath31 and @xmath5 kev @xcite , _ apollo 15 _ in the energy range of @xmath32@xmath33 mev @xcite , and _ kosmos 461 _ between @xmath34 kev and @xmath1 mev @xcite , and by using several balloons @xcite .",
    "while these gamma - ray observatories used phoswich counters , observations by using a balloon - borne double - compton telescope in the energy range above @xmath6 mev began in the 1970s @xcite .",
    "subsequently , observations by using satellites have continued with , for example , the high energy astronomy observatory ( _ heao _ ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the solar maximum mission ( _ smm _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , _ cgro _",
    "@xcite , and _ integral _ @xcite that is based on coded aperture imaging .",
    "an mev bump , which is in excess near a few mev in the _ apollo _ observations , remained a mystery for a long time but is now rejected , because comptel revealed that it was an artifact from delayed gamma - rays produced in radioactive decays in the instrument @xcite .",
    "atmospheric gamma rays have been observed by balloon experiments since the 1960s @xcite .",
    "low - energy atmospheric gamma rays are mainly produced by bremsstrahlung from secondary cascade electrons @xcite , and the electron ",
    "positron annihilation line is also detected @xcite .",
    "some models for atmospheric gamma rays exist , for example , the ling model @xcite and the qinetiq atmospheric radiation model ( qarm ; * ? ? ?",
    "previous observations showed that the flux of atmospheric gamma rays depends on the zenith angle , and models produced by the following scientists are based on the observational results : ling , costa @xcite , and graser @xcite .",
    "cosmic and atmospheric charged particles and neutrons could present large backgrounds in gamma - ray observations ; thus , the estimation of the fluxes of these particles is essential @xcite .",
    "the fluxes of these particles fluctuate on the basis of solar activity , observation altitude , and cutoff rigidity .",
    "a few models for energy spectra of these particles at balloon altitudes have been proposed , such as mizuno s model @xcite and qarm .",
    "recently , in addition to an etcc , balloon experiments with new detection methods have been performed to achieve higher sensitivity in the sub - mev / mev band .",
    "for example , a double - compton camera using a liquid xe detector : the lxegrit @xcite ; multiple compton cameras @xcite by using semiconductors : the nuclear compton telescope ( nct ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) ; an electron - tracking compton camera using an electron tracker made of a semiconductor : the medium energy gamma - ray astronomy ( mega ) telescope @xcite ; and a gamma - ray lens : claire @xcite .",
    "also , such experiments have renewed the attention given to observations of diffuse cosmic gamma rays , atmospheric gamma rays , and the background formed by cosmic rays at balloon altitudes .    in this paper ,",
    "we report the observational results of smile - i .",
    "we first reconstructed the gamma - ray events and then estimated the background produced by the interaction between cosmic ray and the materials surrounding the detector during the flight .",
    "next , we simulated the scattering of diffuse cosmic gamma rays in the atmosphere .",
    "after that we obtained the fluxes of diffuse cosmic and atmospheric gamma rays measured with smile - i . finally , we determined the detection sensitivity of smile - i , and estimated the expected detection sensitivity of a future smile mission .",
    "figure  [ fig : mev_camera ] shows a schematic of the etcc developed by us .",
    "the electron tracker detects the three - dimensional track and the energy of the compton - recoil electron , while the absorber detects the absorption point and energy of the compton - scattered gamma ray . by summing the momenta of both the recoil electron and the scattered gamma ray ,",
    "we obtain the momentum of the incident gamma ray as @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 are the four - dimensional momenta of the incident gamma ray , scattered gamma ray , and recoil electron , respectively .",
    "thus , we can obtain a completely ray - traced gamma - ray image .",
    "the unit vector of the incident gamma ray @xmath39 is described by @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are unit vectors in the directions of the scattered gamma ray and the recoil electron , respectively , and @xmath43 is the scattering angle given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 are the energy of the scattered gamma ray , kinetic energy of the compton - recoil electron , electron mass , and light speed , respectively .",
    "@xmath49 , which is the angle between the scattering direction and the recoil direction , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mev_camera ] , is geometrically measured for each incident gamma ray , @xmath50 and this angle is also obtained from a calculation by the compton scattering kinematics : @xmath51 by comparing @xmath52 with @xmath53 , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a cut parameter , we can select only compton scattering events .",
    "thus , compton imaging with electron tracking is an effective method for mev gamma - ray astronomy , with the serious problem of a large background , as described in section  1 .    for smile",

    "we provide a detailed description of our etcc design in the following paragraphs . as a tracker for detecting compton - recoil electrons",
    ", we developed a gaseous time projection chamber ( tpc ; * ? ? ?",

    "the latter is our original gaseous two - dimensional imaging detector with micro - pixel electrodes produced using printed circuit board technology .",
    "a seed electron drifts into the @xmath10-@xmath62m - thick gem with a velocity of @xmath63 cm @xmath62s@xmath64 at an electric field of @xmath65 v cm@xmath64 , and the first multiplication is caused by the gem with a gain of approximately @xmath67 .",
    "then , the multiplied electrons drift to the @xmath62-pic , and the second multiplication is caused by the @xmath62-pic with a gain of @xmath68",
    ". therefore , we obtain a high gas gain above @xmath69 , which is enough to detect compton - recoil electrons .",
    "the signals from the @xmath62-pic are read using amplifier - shaper - discriminator chips @xcite , which feed an output signal from a charge amplifier to a flash analog - to - digital converter to measure the recoil - electron energy , and a discriminated digital signal to a position encoder that encodes the electron track by using field - programmable gate arrays with a 100-mhz clock @xcite .",
    "because the @xmath62-pic consists of fine - structure pixels with a pitch of @xmath65 @xmath62 m , this tpc has a fine three - dimensional position resolution of @xmath70 @xmath62 m , where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are resolutions perpendicular and parallel to the drift direction , respectively @xcite .",
    "as an absorber for detecting compton - scattered gamma rays , we used @xmath73-pixel - scintillator arrays @xcite , each of which consists of @xmath74 gso : ce scintillator pixels with a pixel size of @xmath75 mm@xmath76 .",
    "for the photon sensor of the scintillation camera , we selected a multi - anode photomultiplier tube ( hamamatsu photonics , flat - panel h8500 ) , which consists of @xmath74 anode pixels with a pixel size of @xmath77 mm@xmath78 .",

    "i , the detection efficiency and the effective area for parallel light is required . however , irradiating the entire system of smile - i by using parallel light in a laboratory is very difficult . instead , we simulated the irradiation with geant4 ( ver 9.0-patch01 ; * ? ? ? * ) by using a mass model shown in fig .",

    "the absorber had an energy resolution of @xmath81 % at full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) and an energy threshold of @xmath23 kev , the tracker had an energy resolution of @xmath82 % at fwhm and an energy threshold of @xmath83 kev , and the veto counter had an energy resolution of @xmath10% at fwhm and an energy threshold of @xmath84 kev .",
    "the time resolutions of the absorber and the veto counter were not considered , because our etcc did not use the event selection based on the time - of - flight between the compton scattering target and the absorber .",

    "table  [ tab : res ] shows the energy and the angular resolutions of the etcc as a function of the incident energy , measured at a ground - based experiment .",
    "the angular resolution of the etcc is defined by two parameters : the angular resolution measure ( arm ) , which is the accuracy of the scattering angle @xmath43 , and the scatter plane deviation ( spd ) , which is the determination accuracy of the compton - scattering plane @xcite . in general , the theoretical limit of the arm is doppler broadening caused by the undetectable momentum of the compton - target electron , and the spd is limited by the multiple scattering of the compton - recoil electron ; thus , an etcc using a gas with a higher atomic number has a poorer angular resolution due to the larger multiple scattering , although it has a higher detection efficiency .",

    "therefore , for gamma rays with energies above the second break , the probability of scattering is so low that @xmath172 decreases .",
    "moreover , rayleigh scattering contributes a large amount ( more than @xmath67% ) to the scattering component ratio under @xmath10 kev .",
    "compared with the previous calculation and simulations of the scattered component ratio function , our simulation result has a difference of @xmath173% from the simulation of horstman at @xmath23@xmath5 kev @xcite , @xmath174% from the calculation of makino at hundreds of kev @xcite , and @xmath175% from the simulation of schnfelder above @xmath6 mev @xcite .",

    "<S> we observed diffuse cosmic and atmospheric gamma rays at balloon altitudes with the sub - mev gamma - ray imaging loaded - on - balloon experiment i ( smile - i ) as the first step toward a future all - sky survey with a high sensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> smile - i employed an electron - tracking compton camera comprised of a gaseous electron tracker as a compton - scattering target and a scintillation camera as an absorber . </S>",
    "<S> the balloon carrying the smile - i detector was launched from the sanriku balloon center of the institute of space and astronautical science / japan aerospace exploration agency ( isas / jaxa ) on september 1 , 2006 , and the flight lasted for @xmath0 hr , including level flight for @xmath1 hr at an altitude of @xmath2@xmath3 km . during the level flight , we successfully detected @xmath4 downward gamma rays between @xmath5 kev and @xmath6 mev at zenith angles below @xmath7 degrees . to obtain the flux of diffuse cosmic gamma rays </S>",
    "<S> , we first simulated their scattering in the atmosphere using geant4 , and for gamma rays detected at an atmospheric depth of @xmath8 g @xmath9 , we found that @xmath10% and @xmath11% of the gamma rays at energies of @xmath12 kev and @xmath6 mev , respectively , were scattered in the atmosphere prior to reaching the detector . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , by using geant4 simulations and the qinetiq atmospheric radiation model , we estimated that the detected events consisted of diffuse cosmic and atmospheric gamma rays ( @xmath13% ) , secondary photons produced in the instrument through the interaction between cosmic rays and materials surrounding the detector ( @xmath14% ) , and other particles ( @xmath15% ) . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained growth curve was comparable to ling s model , and the fluxes of diffuse cosmic and atmospheric gamma rays were consistent with the results of previous experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the expected detection sensitivity of a future smile experiment measuring gamma rays between @xmath12 kev and @xmath16 mev was estimated from our smile - i results and was found to be ten times better than that of other experiments at around @xmath6 mev . </S>"
