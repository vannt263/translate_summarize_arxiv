    "damped ly@xmath0 ( dla ) systems are complexes of neutral gas detectable in the spectra of background quasars as hi absorption lines with large column densities , n(hi)@xmath9 10@xmath10 atoms @xmath11 ( wolfe et al .",
    "the damped ly@xmath0 absorptions are found at all redshifts @xmath12 and are associated with metal lines of low ionization and often high ionized species as well .",
    "although the exact nature of the dla systems has yet to be clarified , there is consensus on the fact that they are the progenitors of present - day galaxies . damped",
    "galaxies might be massive rotating disks which will evolve to the present - day spiral galaxies ( wolfe et al .",
    "1986 , 1995a , prochaska & wolfe 1997 ) or less massive objects progenitors of dwarf galaxies ( tyson 1988 , pettini et al .",
    "1990 , meyer and york 1992 , steidel et al .",
    "understanding which interpretation is the more appropriate has important implications for any theory of galaxy formation and evolution . imaging in the field of the background quasars suggests that more than a single population of galaxies give rise to the dlas , even though the results are sometimes ambiguous , especially at high redshift ( briggs et al .",
    "1989 , steidel & hamilton 1992 ) . at @xmath13 1",
    "the candidate associations include gas - rich galaxies with a variety of morfological types ( le brun et al .",
    "1997 ; lanzetta et al .",
    "very recently rao & turnshek ( 1998 ) discovered two dla absorbers at very low redshift ( z=0.091 , z=0.221 ) and by means of imaging observations they exclude that they are luminous spiral galaxies .",
    "dla galaxies have low metallicities , typically between 1% and 10% of solar , a signature of the enrichment of the first stellar generations .",
    "the precision obtained in abundance studies of dlas is remarkable and comparable to that attained in the interstellar studies of our own galaxy , thus offering important clues for understanding the nature of these objects .",
    "element abundance ratios are tracers of galactic chemical evolution ( see e.g. lauroesch et al . 1996 , matteucci , molaro & vladilo , 1997 ) , however the results obtained for dla galaxies are subject to some debate .",
    "the typical overabundance of @xmath0-elements compared to iron - peak elements ( @xmath0/fe ) found in galactic metal - poor stars is observed in dlas by means of the si / fe ratios , which is interpreted as a signature of the first stages of chemical evolution of a spiral galaxy like the milky way ( wolfe et al .",
    "1995b , lu et al . 1996 ) . on the other hand , the @xmath0/fe ratios in dlas",
    "are observed close to solar when a dust - free diagnostic such as s / zn is used ( molaro , centurin & vladilo 1998 ; hereafter mcv ) , or when the observed abundances of refractory elements ( as fe and si ) are corrected by dust depletion ( vladilo 1998 ) .",
    "nitrogen is an important element when attempting to understand the chemical history of dla galaxies .",
    "the nucleosynthesis of n , which takes place mainly in low and intermediate mass stars , is quite complex and can be used to probe conditions typical of early stages of galactic chemical evolution .",
    "although the dominant processes which lead to the enrichment of n are still not fully understood it seems clear that secondary synthesis of n  which occur in stars of all masses  plays an important role at high metallicities ( vila - costas & edmunds 1993 ) . in this case secondary origin of",
    "n refers to its production in the cno cycle from seed c and o nuclei created in earlier generation of stars . however , at low metallicity levels , nitrogen observations in halo stars ( carbon et al .",
    "1987 , tomkin & lambert 1984 ) and in hii regions of dwarf irregular galaxies ( thuan , izotov & lipovetsky 1995 ; kobulnicky & skillman 1996 ) require a significant primary component in the synthesis of this element . primary production of n is obtained in intermediate mass stars when freshly synthesized c in the helium - burning shell penetrates into the hydrogen - burning shell of the same star where it is converted into n during the asymptotic giant branch phase of their evolution ( renzini & voli , 1981 ) .",
    "even though a general consensus is lacking , it has been suggested that primary n might be also produced ",
    "esentially by the same mechanism  in massive stars of low metallicities ( woosley & weaver , 1995 ) .",
    "this production is strongly dependent on the assumed treatment of convection in stellar interiors but it seems necessary in order to explain the high n abundances relative to o observed in some dwarf irregular galaxies and some dlas ( matteucci , molaro & vladilo , 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "a further advantage of n is that it is not depleted onto dust in the galactic interstellar medium ( savage & sembach 1996 ; mayer , cardelli & sofia 1997 ) ; therefore n abundances measured in dla systems and in extragalactic hii regions are expected to reflect the real ( gas plus dust ) n abundances .",
    "the first attempt to detect nitrogen in dlas was made by pettini , lipman & hunstead ( 1995 ) who derived a stringent upper limit ( [ n / h]@xmath14 3.15 ) for the absorber at @xmath15=2.279 towards qso 23481444 .",
    "the upper limit on the [ n / o ] ratio in this system ( @xmath14 1.24 ) implied the lowest ratio ever found either in stars or galaxies at low metallicity , in line with a secondary origin of nitrogen .",
    "pettini and colleagues argued that this result is consistent with a delayed delivery of n created mainly in intermediate mass stars compared to o enrichment produced in short - lived massive stars ( edmunds & pagel 1978 ; garnett 1990 ) .",
    "nitrogen was first detected in the damped absorbers at z=1.776 towards mc 1331 + 170 ( green et al .",
    "1995 ; kulkarni et al . 1996 ) and at z=3.390 towards qso 0000 - 2620 ( vladilo et al .",
    "1995 ; molaro et al .",
    "1996 ) . in both cases",
    "the reported n / o abundance ratio is much higher than the upper limit derived by pettini , lipman & hunstead ( 1995 ) .",
    "these results gave the first indication of an intrinsic dispersion of nitrogen abundances in dlas , as pointed out by vladilo et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and molaro et al .",
    "the high nitrogen abundance ratios are not easy to understand and non conventional chemical evolution models of the type used for dwarf irregular galaxies have been proposed by matteucci , molaro & vladilo ( 1997 ) .    in a subsequent work , lu et al .",
    "( 1996 ) found a stringent upper limit in the dla at @xmath15=2.994 towards qso 1946 + 7658 , in line with the result reported by pettini and colleagues .",
    "( 1996 ) interpreted this low n / o value as an evidence of the first stages of chemical evolution of a spiral galaxy like the milky way .",
    "more recently , four new nitrogen abundances were obtained by lu , sargent & barlow ( 1998 ) offering further evidence for an intrinsic dispersion of the nitrogen abundances in dlas . from the analysis of the [ n / si ] ratios in dla galaxies",
    "the latter argue that the observed dispersion can be expected considering the time delay between oxygen and nitrogen delivery .    in this paper",
    "we describe three new ni abundance determinations in the dla systems at @xmath15 = 2.309 towards qso 0100 + 1300 , at @xmath15 = 2.827 towards qso 1425 + 6039 , and at @xmath15 = 3.025 towards qso 0347@xmath23819 .",
    "the detections are based on the six ni lines of the multiplets at 1134 and 1200 .",
    "a preliminary report for the dla system towards qso 0347@xmath23819 was given in vladilo et al .",
    "in section 2 and 3 we present our observations and column density measurements which also include sii , siii , oi , and feii determinations .",
    "abundance measurements for all the dlas with nitrogen detections are compiled from our data and from the literature , and are presented in section 4 .",
    "element - to - element ratios in particular n / zn , n / fe , and n / s are discussed in section 5 in connection to the origin of n in the framework of chemical evolution models .",
    "the implications for our understanding of the nature of dla galaxies are summarised in section 6 .",
    "as part of a search for nitrogen absorptions in dlas we obtained optical spectra of qso 0100 + 1300 ( v=16.6 ) , qso 1425 + 6039 ( v=15.8 ) , and qso 03473819 ( v=17.3 ) .",
    "the spectra of the first two qsos were obtained with the utrecht echelle spectrograph ( walker & diego 1985 ) at the nasmyth focus of the 4.2 m william herschel telescope of the observatorio del roque de los muchachos on la palma island .",
    "the spectra of qso 03473819 were obtained with the caspec spectrograph at the cassegrain focus of the eso 3.6 m telescope at la silla , chile ( pasquini & dodorico 1989 ) . in both",
    "spectrographs an echelle grating of 31.6 grooves / mm and a 1024x1024 tektronik ccd with square pixels of 24 @xmath16 m in size were used .",
    "the ccd was binned at a step of 2 pixels along the dispersion and the slit width was set at 2.1 `` ( caspec ) and 2.2 '' ( ues ) in order to project the slit onto 2 binned pixels of the detector .",
    "the slit width matched the seeing which was around 2 arcsecs during the observations .",
    "the full width at half maximum of the instrumental profile , @xmath17 , was measured from the emission lines of the thorium - argon lamp spectra recorded frequently during the observations .",
    "the resulting resolving power r= @xmath18/@xmath17 was r @xmath19 27000 ( ues spectra ) and 19500 ( caspec spectra ) , corresponding to a velocity resolution of @xmath20v @xmath19 11.5 km s@xmath21  and 15.4 km s@xmath21 , respectively .",
    "the journal of the observations is given in table 1 .",
    "the spectra taken on different nights were reduced separately and then averaged using weights according to the square of their s / n ratios .",
    "cosmic ray removal , sky subtraction , optimal order extraction and wavelength calibration were performed using the echelle routines implemented within the midas software package developed at eso .",
    "typical internal errors in the wavelength calibrations are of @xmath19 0.01 - 0.02  .",
    "the wavelength scale of the spectra was corrected to vacuum heliocentric scale . finally , each order of the spectra was normalised using a spline to connect smoothly the regions free from absorption features",
    ". the signal - to - noise ratios of the final spectra  estimated from the @xmath22 scatter of the continuum near the absorptions under study  are typically in the range between 10 and 20 . for the two dlas at higher redshift ,",
    "the oi 1302 , oi 1355  and siii 1304transitions fall in a part of the spectrum where the signal - to - noise ratios can be as high as 45 thanks to the increase of the ccd quantum efficiency towards the red .",
    "column densities have been derived by best fitting theoretical voigt profiles to the observed absorption lines via @xmath23 minimization .",
    "this step was performed using the routines fitlyman ( fontana & ballester 1995 ) included in the midas package . before the fit",
    ", the theoretical profiles were convolved with the instrumental point spread function determined from the analysis of the emission lines of the arcs .",
    "portions of the profiles contaminated by intervening ly @xmath0 absorbers were excluded from the fit .",
    "the fitlyman routines determine column densities , broadening parameters ( @xmath24 values ) and redshifts of the absorption components , as well as the fit errors for each of these quantities .",
    "the laboratory wavelengths of the transitions investigated are listed in table 2 together with the oscillator strenghts adopted for computation of theoretical profiles .",
    "when several unsaturated transitions are detected for a given element , the column density is estimated by applying the fit procedure both to the individual transitions and to the full set of available lines .",
    "no differences were found between the mean column density resulting from individual fits and the column density obtained from the simultaneous fit of all the available lines . in these cases",
    "we adopted the dispersion from individual measurements as conservative column density errors .",
    "nitrogen column densities were determined from the six transitions of the two ni multiplets at @xmath181134  and @xmath181200  ( see table 2 ) .",
    "the ni lines occur in the ly @xmath0 forest , but the identification of the absorptions is quite reliable because it is very unlikely that each one of the six transitions is blended with a ly @xmath0 interloper .",
    "the oscillator strengths span about one order of magnitude offering a large dynamical range for the measurement of the column density .",
    "the detection of the faintest transitions of the @xmath18 1134multiplet is especially important to get rid of saturation effects .",
    "these transitions are not saturated and therefore uncertainties in @xmath24(ni ) do not affect the derived ni column densities .",
    "the fits of nitrogen lines for the three dla systems under investigation are shown in fig . 1 , 2 and 3 and the resulting column densities",
    "are reported in table 3 . in the same table",
    "we list the rest of extant determinations of ni column densities or upper limits taken from the literature . in total",
    "there are nine ni detections available : four from our project , one from kulkarni et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , four from the recent measurements reported by lu , sargent & barlow ( 1998 ) .",
    "in addition there are eight upper limits ( pettini , lipman & hunstead 1995 ; lu , sargent & barlow 1998 ) .    in order to understand the nucleosynthetic origin of nitrogen",
    "it is necessary to compare its abundance with that of other elements .",
    "in addition to the nitrogen lines , we therefore searched for transitions of important species such as oi , siii , sii , and feii which fall in the wavelength range of our spectra ( see table 2 ) .",
    "column densities and @xmath24 values of these elements for the dlas towards qso 03473819 and qso 1425@xmath256039 are reported in table 4 and for the system towards qso 0100 + 1300 are given in mcv .    for saturated transitions ,",
    "lower limits to the column density were estimated from the equivalent width obtained from the best fit to the absorption .",
    "for undetected transitions , upper limits to the column density were derived from 3@xmath26 upper limits of the equivalent width . in both cases",
    "the conversion from equivalent widths to column densities was performed in the optically thin limit ( linear part of the curve of growth ) .",
    "oxygen column densities in dlas are generally uncertain by more than one order of magnitude owing to the saturation of the oi 1302  line which is present even at low metallicities . in order to constrain the oi column density",
    "we fitted the oi 1302  line by adopting the @xmath24 value obtained from the analysis of the ni multiplets , which is expected to trace the same neutral gas as oi .",
    "the @xmath24 value of both atoms should in fact be very similar : @xmath27 = 0.94 @xmath28 for pure thermal broadening and @xmath27 = @xmath28 for pure turbulence .",
    "the other accessible oi transition at 1356  is extremely weak ( f@xmath29 = 1.248 x 10@xmath30 ) and is not detected in the dla systems under study ( see e.g. fig . 4 and fig .",
    "the derived upper limits are given in table 4 .",
    "measurements of sii column densities are derived from the sii triplet at 1254  which is generally unsaturated .",
    "this triplet , however , can be contaminated by the lyman @xmath0 forest and we have been able to measure the sulphur column density only for two of the three dla systems under study . as far as iron",
    "is concerned , there are six feii transitions available , listed in table 2 . for each of the three dla galaxies studied here , there are one or two feii unsaturated lines , and free from blends , which have allowed us to derive reliable iron column densities .",
    "silicon transitions in the available spectral ranges are usually heavily saturated hampering attempts to derive accurate siii column densities .",
    "more details on the measurements performed in individual systems are given in the next sub - sections .",
    "the ni column density of this system was measured via the simultaneous fit of the two lines at shorter wavelength of the ni 1134  multiplet .",
    "as one can see in fig .",
    "1 , the reddest transition of this multiplet is in fact contaminated by a ly @xmath0 interloper .",
    "the ni 1200  multiplet presents strong contamination and is highly saturated .",
    "the column density that we derive  log n(ni ) = 14.69(@xmath60.07 )  is at variance with the one found by lu , sargent & barlow ( 1998 ) , log n(ni)= 15.29 @xmath6 0.35 ( see table 3 ) .",
    "these authors obtained this result by means of keck hires data , but details on the measurement are deferred to a subsequent paper . the large error bar reported by lu , sargent &",
    "barlow ( 1998 ) suggests that n(ni ) was obtained from the 1200  multiplet .",
    "in fact , the 1134  multiplet falls below the spectral range usually covered by hires observations ( see table 1 in lu et al .",
    "we stress that our measure relies instead on the analysis of the unsaturated ni absorptions at @xmath31 1134.1 and 1134.4  .",
    "the main absorption component of the system towards qso 0100 + 1300 falls at @xmath1 = 2.30907 in our spectra . a secondary component at @xmath32 @xmath3 35 km s@xmath21 has been also detected in the most intense absorption lines of this system ( wolfe et al .",
    "1994 , mcv ) .",
    "analysis of the most intense ni lines does not yield information on this component , owing to ly@xmath0 contamination .",
    "however , close inspection of our spectrum redwards of the 1134.41  line shows a portion free from ly@xmath0 contamination without traces of absorption exceeding the noise level . therefore the @xmath32 @xmath3 35 km s@xmath21 component  if present in ni at all  must be negligible compared to the main one .",
    "wolfe et al . ( 1994 ) in their higher resolution ( @xmath33=8 km",
    "s@xmath21 ) spectra at redder wavelengths ( 4427 - 6900 ) revealed an asymmetric profile of the main component suggesting the presence of an additional component at @xmath32 @xmath3 8 km s@xmath21 .",
    "the effect of this double structure of the main component on the column density of ni is negligible .",
    "in fact , using a two - cloud model the ni fit gives a total column density within 0.01 dex of the one - cloud model .",
    "abundances of other elements like sii , feii , mgii , mnii , pii ( from our data ) and znii ( from wolfe et al .",
    "1994 ) in this system are discussed in mcv .",
    "the intense siii 1304  and oi 1302  absorptions outside the lyman @xmath0 forest show two components ; the stronger lying at @xmath1= 3.02476 and the weaker at @xmath1= 3.02562 ( see fig .",
    "the column density of the secondary component is less than 10% of that of the main one for both species . for ni , feii and sii ,",
    "only the main component is clearly detected . in these cases",
    "we used a single component fit and adopted the resulting column density as the total column density .",
    "the ni multiplets are clearly identified , but some contamination from lyman @xmath0 absorption is visible , particularly in the vicinity of some lines of the 1134  multiplet . to minimize contamination we measured the column density by fitting the central parts of the line profiles .",
    "the weakest line of the 1134  multiplet  noisy and apparently contaminated  was excluded from the fit .",
    "results are shown in fig . 2 and in table 3 .",
    "the column density of siii was estimated from the analysis of the 1304  line , which falls outside the lyman @xmath0 forest and has the lowest oscillator strength among the available siii transitions .",
    "this fit gives log n(siii ) = 15.07 @xmath6 0.43 and @xmath24 = 21 @xmath6 5 km s@xmath21 .",
    "an attempt to fit also simultaneously the 1193transition , which appears to be unblended , yields instead log n(siii ) = 15.50 @xmath6 0.69 and @xmath24 = 17 @xmath6 4 km s@xmath21 .",
    "silicon abundance must obviously be treated with some caution .    the analysis of ni and siii yields consistent values of the broadening parameter , although the value @xmath24= 17.9 @xmath6 1.1 km s@xmath21  derived from the ni multiplets is more precise .",
    "we adopted this value , with a 3@xmath26 error ( @xmath6 3.3 km s@xmath21 ) , to fit species for which the @xmath24 value is undetermined .",
    "there is only one transition of the sii triplet which is not contaminated by ly @xmath0 interlopers , namely the one at 1260 .",
    "the identification is supported by the perfect coincidence of the redshift and by the narrowness of the absorption profile .",
    "we obtain log n(sii ) = 14.77 @xmath6 0.06 where the error is the fit error at a fixed value of @xmath24 .",
    "an additional @xmath6 0.06 error results when the above mentioned range of possible @xmath24 values is taken into account .",
    "the sii column density is fairly independent of the adopted value of the broadening parameter .",
    "many feii transitions of this system are potentially present in the spectral range of our spectra ( see fig .",

    "the intervening hii regions will have in general a different kinematics from the hi gas and this will lead to differences in the radial velocity profiles of neutrals ( originated only in hi gas ) and singly ionized species ( originated both in hi and hii gas )",

    "a fraction of the elements in dlas are expected to be in the form of dust grains thus reducing the gas phase abundance which is precisely what we are measuring .",
    "the evidence for dust in dlas is manyfold .",
    "one is the differential reddening of quasars with and without foreground damped absorption ( pei , fold & betchold 1991 ) .",
    "another piece of evidence comes from the apparent enhancement of the zn to cr abundance ratio in dla systems ( pettini et al .",
    "1994 , 1997 ) .",
    "based on the expectation that zn tracks cr , pettini and colleagues interpret the observed [ zn / cr ] enhancement as a signature of cromium depletion onto dust grains .",
    "vladilo ( 1998 ) calculated dust - to - gas ratios in dlas with fe , cr , and zn measurements and found quantitative agreement with the dust - to - gas ratios based on the reddening determinations by pei , fold & betchold ( 1991 ) .",
    "the detection of the 2175  emission bump in high redshift mgii absorbers ( malhotra 1997 ) and the realization that type ii snae can produce dust ( danziger et al . 1991 ) also suggest that dust is present in the early stages of galactic evolution .",
    "depletions in dla absorbers are expected to be lower than in the galactic ism since the dust - to - gas ratios in dlas are between @xmath19 2% and @xmath19 25% ( vladilo 1998 ) that of the galactic ones .",
    "however , care must be taken when converting column densities into abundances while considering elements which are known to be depleted from gas to dust .",
    "there are different pieces of evidence which indicate that nitrogen is not depleted in the interstellar medium . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the large activation energy of n@xmath44 prevents involvement of nitrogen in the gas - phase reactions which lead to dust formation in stellar atmospheres ( gail & sedlmayr 1986 ) , and hence interstellar accretion of n onto dust grains is not expected . from the observational point of view , two recent works confirm that interstellar n is not depleted into dust grains . on the one side , interstellar hst observations of the ni @xmath181160  doublet ( meyer , cardelli & sofia 1997 ) show that the gas - phase abundance of nitrogen does not decrease in sight lines with higher h@xmath44 fraction which are indicative of self - shielding environments more hospitable to grains . on the other , iso observations of the n - h stretch spectral region at 2.96 @xmath16 m limit the solid - state of n abundance to log ( n / h)@xmath45 @xmath46 , corresponding to a n depletion lower than 0.01 dex , for the line of sight to iv cyg no . 12 which is known to be heavily reddened ( whittet et al . 1997 ) .    among the elements considered here , also o , s and zn are almost unaffected by depletion in galactic interstellar clouds , their typical deficiency with respect to solar values being in the range [ @xmath47 , [ 0.00 ] , and [ @xmath48 dex , respectively ( meyer et al .",
    "1998 , savage & sembach 1996 , roth & blades 1995 ) .",
    "by contrast , refractory elements such as si and fe are known to be depleted by 1 or 2 dex in the galactic ism . in particular , a fraction of iron as high as about 94@xmath49 is locked in dust grains in the warm gas of the galactic disk , and a fraction even greater in cold clouds ( savage & sembach 1996 ) .",
    "these elements are expected to be depleted also in dlas and in section 5 we discuss how to estimate the amount of depletion .",
    "the measurement of dust depletion in the galactic ism relies on the adoption of a suitable reference level for the elemental abundances .",
    "the solar abundance pattern is usually adopted as a standard , but there are indications that the pattern observed in nearby b - type stars might be more appropriate ( see savage & sembach 1996 ) .",
    "metal abundances are typically @xmath50 dex lower in b - type stars than in the solar system and some authors prefer to use 2/3 of the solar system values as a standard for `` cosmic '' abundances ( see savage & sembach 1996 , mathis 1996 ) .",
    "adoption of this abundance reference would yield dust depletions consistently lower in absolute values .    the average interstellar abundance of nitrogen , @xmath14log(n / h)@xmath9@xmath51 = 4.12@xmath60.02 ( meyer , cardelli & sofia 1997 ) , is slightly deficient with respect to the solar value log ( n / h)@xmath52=4.03 @xmath60.07 ( grevesse & noels 1993 ) , yielding an underabundance @xmath14[n / h]@xmath9@xmath51 = 0.09@xmath60.07 .",
    "also nearby b stars show a similar underabundance , with @xmath14log(n / h)@xmath9@xmath53 = 4.17@xmath54 ( venn 1995 ) .",
    "these results indicate non depletion of n into interstellar grains if the b - type star reference is adopted , or depletion of @xmath55 dex if the solar pattern is adopted .",
    "meyer et al . (",
    "1997 ) pointed out that limitations in deriving [ n / h ] in the galactic ism no longer lie in the measurement itself , but in the accuracy of the oscillator strenghts and in the solar photospheric determinations .",
    "due to these uncertainties the authors claimed that it is still premature to rule out an interstellar n abundance either equal to , or 2/3 of solar .",
    "we adopt here the solar reference pattern , and for nitrogen the solar photospheric value of grevesse & noels ( 1993 ) quoted above .",
    "this is not in sharp contrast with the fact that we assume nitrogen to be undepleted in dlas because the expected absolute value for galactic depletion @xmath56 dex would become negligible at the low dust - to - gas ratios typical of dla absorbers .",
    "consequences of adopting the b stars as standard for the abundances are considered in the next section .",
    "the absolute nitrogen abundances in dla absorbers shown in table 5 span more than two orders of magnitude , with 3.7 dex @xmath14 [ n / h ] @xmath57 dex . from the point of view of chemical evolution models ,",
    "relative abundances are more reliable than absolute abundances because they generally depend only on the elemental nucleosynthesis and stellar lifetimes , whereas absolute abundances are affected by specific assumptions underlying the models . here",
    "we discuss the abundance of nitrogen relative to the iron - peak and to @xmath0 elements , which are the main products of type ia snae and type ii snae , respectively .",
    "we compare measurements of [ n / fe ] and [ n/@xmath0 ] ratios in dlas and in other astrophysical sites of similarly low metallicity , namely galactic halo stars , blue compact galaxies , and dwarf irregular galaxies .",

    "the large scatter in the stellar measurements reflects the difficulties in deriving n abundances from nh bands .",

    "there is general consistency between dla , bcg , and halo star measurements , with the exception of a few cases in which the [ n / fe ] are lower in dlas .",
    "however , the interpretation of the observed [ n / fe ] ratios must take into account that iron is one of the most refractory elements , while nitrogen is undepleted , as we discussed in section 4.3 . before drawing any conclusions from the comparison of the [ n / fe ] ratios",
    "it is hence necessary to take into account the presence of dust .",
    "the [ n / fe ] values corrected for dust depletions are shown in fig .",
    "7 where we use the same symbols for dlas as in fig . 6 .",
    "the net effect of the correction is a diagonal shift of the points  at different lengths for each object  which results from the increase in fe abundance at invariant n abundance .",
    "the iron depletions were estimated with two methods .",
    "for the dlas which have both fe and zn abundance measurements we estimated the amount of depletion by assuming that zinc tracks closely iron , [ zn / fe ] @xmath19 0 , as is indeed observed in galactic stars with metallicities @xmath61 [ fe / h ] @xmath62 ( sneden , gratton , & crocker , 1991 ) and in the large magellanic cloud stars ( russel & dopita 1992 ) , and by assuming that dust in dlas is of the same type as the galactic one . with both assumptions we estimated the fe and zn depletions starting from the galactic interstellar values @xmath63(fe ) = @xmath64 dex and @xmath63(zn ) = @xmath65 dex ( savage & sembach , 1996 , roth & blades 1995 ) ) .",

    "this spread is specific to n and has no equivalent in other abundance ratios measured in dlas , which are remarkably similar both at face values ( see e.g. fig .",
    "23 by lu et al . 1996 ) and after correction for dust depletion ( vladilo 1998 ) .    as can be seen in fig .",

    "the slight underabundance of the measurements taken at face value shown in fig .",
    "6 is in fact amplified after correction for dust depletion .",

    "6 would shift in the same direction as the dla points in fig .",
    "therefore , we can not exclude that [ n / fe ] measurements in bcgs are consistent with dla determinations , as they were before the correction for the presence of dust .",
    "after correction for dust depletion the majority of the dla data are in line with a pure secondary origin of nitrogen , which in fig .",

    "this behaviour is quite different from that of halo metal - poor stars which show a constant [ n / o ] with metallicity , consistent with a primary origin of nitrogen .",
    "the difference between the nitrogen abundances of galactic metal - poor stars and dlas suggests that the chemical enrichment history of these dlas has been somewhat different from that experienced by our own galaxy .",
    "however , there is at least one remarkable exception for qso 0000 - 2620 where the nitrogen remains particularly high , at the level observed in galactic halo stars .",
    "the [ n/@xmath0 ] ratio is an important tool when unravelling the nucleosynthetic history of nitrogen .",
    "the abundances for the @xmath0 elements s , si , and o are reported in table 5 .",
    "unfortunately it is quite difficult to obtain accurate oxygen abundances in dlas , as we have discussed in section 3 .",
    "this problem has often been circumvented by taking s or si as a proxy for o , under the assumption that the [ @xmath0/o ] ratio does not evolve with metallicity .",
    "s and si are @xmath0-elements produced in the same massive stars that produce o , and therefore the ratios between these elements are predicted to vary little , if at all , with time ( timmes woosley & weaver 1995 ) .",
    "however , some caution must be taken when using silicon as a proxy of oxygen . from the theoretical point of view , type i snae produce more silicon than oxygen ( nomoto et al .",
    "1984 ; thielemann et al .",
    "the observations indicate that si traces o in galactic stars ( kilian - montenbruck , gheren & nissen 1994 ; venn 1995 ) , but is slightly underabundant relative to o in extragalactic hii regions ( garnett et al . 1995 ) .",
    "this underabundance is interpreted as due to si depletion onto dust grains .",
    "in addition to the uncertainty due to silicon depletion , we remark that si lines are often saturated even at the low column densities typical of dlas . for these reasons",
    "we prefer to adopt sulphur as a tracer of the @xmath0-elements .",
    "sulphur is found to track closely oxygen in galactic stars ( see references in lauroesch et al .",

    "the `` pmassive '' curve with a plateau assumes primary n both in intermediate mass stars and in massive stars , where in all the other tracks it is secondary .",

    "7  that the dispersion of n abundances is real and not due to different amounts of dust among the dlas .",

    "the [ n / s ] value in the dla towards qso 0930 + 2858 ( empty square in the middle of fig .",

    "the value for the dla towards qso 2343 + 1230 ( empty square at the top of the figure ) falls well above the area limited by the evolutionary tracks with secondary plus primary production of nitrogen .",

    "this last determination was obtained by constraining the @xmath24 value of the saturated oxygen lines from the broadening obtained from the nitrogen lines ( see discussion in section 3 ) . even considering the uncertainty of the oxygen measurement",
    "it is clear that nitrogen has an intrinsically high abundance in this dla .",
    "it is important to note that for specific dla systems the [ n/@xmath0 ] and [ n / fe]@xmath7 values are mutually consistent .",
    "the same points which show a secondary behaviour in [ n/@xmath0 ] also show a secondary behaviour in [ n / fe]@xmath7 .",
    "we stress that the [ n / fe ] and [ n / s ] results would not lead to consistent results if iron depletion were not taken into account .",
    "the different values of n / o observed at a given o / h metallicity in dlas may be attributed to a delay between the delivery of o and n into the ism when the star formation proceeds in bursts ( edmunds & pagel 1978 ) .",
    "this delay has also been suggested by garnett ( 1990 ) to explain the n / o scatter in dwarfs irregulars . according to this picture , galaxies which have experienced a recent episode of star formation show low n / o ratios due to the quick production of o in massive stars and the prompt return to the ism which is over after a few 10@xmath68 years . on the other hand , in galaxies that have been quiescent for a long period , nitrogen",
    "would be returned to the ism after a few 10@xmath69 years mainly as a product of intermediate mass stars . during the long quiescence",
    "the n / o ratio will increase at about constant o / h . in this model , different ages or temporal gaps from recent bursts of star formation",
    "are responsible for the dispersion of the n / o ratios , with low values implying a recent burst and high values pointing to a long quiescent period .",
    "skillman ( 1998 ) discussed two cases of dwarf irregular galaxies with values of [ n / o ] around 0.7 for which there is clear evidence of recent star formation , in agreement with the interpretation of a prompt o enrichment of the ism .",
    "however , some problems arise in this scenario if dla abundances of other elements are considered .",
    "if the delayed model also applies to dlas , then it seems reasonable to expect an overabundance of the @xmath0-elements relative to iron - peak elements when low values of [ n / o ] are observed , i.e. in the phase temporally near the starburst .",
    "in fact in this phase the elemental production is dominated by type ii snae which are rich in @xmath0-elements .",
    "the few cases in which a measurement of the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratio and of nitrogen abundances are available do not conform with this prediction .",
    "for instance , as discussed in mcv , the dla galaxies towards qso 0100 + 1300 and qso 1331 + 1700 have [ s / zn ] @xmath19 0 even if they show the lowest [ n/@xmath0 ] values . in the absorber towards qso 1331 + 1700",
    "it has been suggested that an intervening hii region could lead to an artificially low [ n / s ] ratio ( see section 4.2 ) , since [ n / o ] @xmath9 [ n / s ] in this system ( kulkarni et al .",
    "for the system towards qso 0100 + 1300 it is improbable that the [ n / s ] ratio is artificially lowered due to an intercepted hii region since independent fits of the ni and sii lines give consistent @xmath24 values ( see mcv ) , while differences between the profiles of the two species would be expected if contribution from hii regions were present .",
    "the low [ n / s ] value in this dla absorber is therefore difficult to understand in the framework of the n - delayed model since the expected overabundance of the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratio is not appreciable .    also the highest [ n/@xmath0 ] ratios observed in the dlas in fig .",
    "8 are difficult to reconcile with the delayed nitrogen release .",
    "in fact in this model , n / o ratios are expected to lie in the region limited by the tracks of primary and secondary nitrogen production ( vila - costas & edmunds , 1993 ) .",
    "as we mentioned before , the system towards qso 2343 + 1230 , and perhaps also the one towards qso 0000 - 2620 , lie well above the track of primary plus secondary production instead .",
    "matteucci , molaro & vladilo ( 1997 ) showed that the highest n / o values observed in dla galaxies can only be reproduced by chemical evolution models which assume primary production of n in massive stars , together with selective galactic winds which carry away , preferentially , the products of type ii snae explosions , such as oxygen and other @xmath0 elements .",
    "we conclude that the time delay model requires other _ ingredients _",
    "( for example selective galactic winds among others ) in order to explain some of the n / o ratios observed in dlas , once they are integrated with the other abundances observed in these galaxies .",
    "new abundance determinations are needed in order to understand how common are the very low and extremely high ratios in dla galaxies .",
    "we have presented three new measurements of nitrogen abundances in dla galaxies , increasing by 50% the number of determinations available in the literature ( not including upper limits ) .",
    "the abundances of nitrogen have been discussed in connection with the iron - peak elements ( iron and zinc ) and @xmath0-elements ( represented by sulphur ) for the nine absorbers with available n data .",
    "the effect of dust depletion on the abundance determinations has been taken into account .",
    "we have compared the nitrogen measurements in dla galaxies with measurements in other astrophysical sites of low metallicity and with predictions from chemical evolution models .",
    "the main results of the present work can be summarised as follows .    *",
    "the n / s and n / fe abundance ratios show a scatter of one order of magnitude or more , at variance with the remarkably low scatter observed for other elemental ratios measured in dla galaxies .",
    "* when the presence of dust is considered to correct the iron abundances , a substantial fraction of [ n / fe ] values are lower than those in galactic halo stars .",
    "a similar conclusion holds for the [ n/@xmath0 ] ratios obtained from the [ n / s ] measurements which are expected to be unaffected by dust depletion .",
    "these results suggest that the chemical evolution of dla galaxies has been somewhat different from that experienced by the milky way . *",
    "the [ n / fe ] ratios in bcgs are similar to those measured in dla galaxies and this similarity may remain also after correction for the presence of dust , provided this correction is also appropriate for bcgs .",
    "the n / o ratios in dwarf galaxies have similar values and exhibit a similar spread to those observed in dla galaxies .",
    "* when compared with theoretical evolution models , it is not possible to explain the observations in dla galaxies by invoking a unique production mechanism .",
    "some cases are consistent with a secondary behaviour of nitrogen , while others require primary production .",
    "this may suggest that dla absorbers include galaxies with different chemical histories .",
    "most of the scatter of the nitrogen abundances can also be interpreted in the framework of the delayed model for nitrogen production ( edmunds & pagel , 1978 ; garnett 1990 ) .",
    "however in this scenario dla galaxies with low [ n/@xmath0 ] values , which should be temporally close to the starburst , are expected to show an enhancement of @xmath0-elements which is instead not observed , making necessary the addition of new ingredients to the model in order to explain the observed abundance ratios . * in one or possibly two dla galaxies there is evidence for an extremely high n / o ratio , well above the values measured in galactic halo stars or in extragalactic hii regions .",
    "the few dla systems with n / o ratios higher than those in any other astrophysical site can not be accommodated in the framework of the delayed nitrogen model : in this case differential galactic winds plus primary n production in massive stars are required as ingredients of the chemical evolution model ( matteucci et al ."

    "<S> comparison with chemical evolution models show that the lowest [ n / fe]@xmath7 and [ n/@xmath0 ] dla values are close to what would be expected for a pure secondary origin of nitrogen , while higher values are mostly consistent with a primary component . </S>",
    "<S> the behaviour of nitrogen abundance ratios can be ascribed , in general , to the delayed release of nitrogen in the course of evolution . </S>",
    "<S> however it is difficult to conciliate this interpretation with the lowest [ n/@xmath0 ] values measured , since an expected enhancement of @xmath0-elements respect to the iron - peak elements is not observed simultaneously in these dla galaxies . in two cases , </S>",
    "<S> relatively high [ n/@xmath0 ] values are observed which require also a more complex chemical evolution to be explained . </S>"
