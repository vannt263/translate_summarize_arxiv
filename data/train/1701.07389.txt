    "a topological superconductor forms a new state of quantum matter and possesses a pairing gap in the bulk and gapless surface states which in some cases form non - trivial majorana bound states.@xcite the majorana bound states can be interpreted as fermionic particles equivalent to their own antiparticles , and have potential applications in fault - tolerant topological quantum computation.@xcite additionally to p - wave superconductors like @xmath10 or d+id superconductors on hexagonal lattices,@xcite new platforms to host majorana bound states based on proximitizing ordinary singlet - spin superconductor to a material with a strong spin - orbit interaction were proposed.@xcite in addition to spectroscopic signatures of the majorana bound states,@xcite recent experiments on josephson junctions ( jjs ) based on rashba wires or topological insulators , which could show topologically non - trivial modes , have attracted a lot of attention.@xcite    josephson junctions containing a topologically protected andreev level exhibit @xmath1-periodicity in respect to the superconducting phase difference @xmath11.@xcite hence , the measurement of topological properties of the jj involves a probing of the periodicity of the electronic properties of the junction .",
    "this can be achieved by means of the ac - josephson effect.@xcite for example , when the jj is biased by dc- and ac - currents @xmath12 , the average voltage develops plateaus at integer multiples of @xmath13 , i.e.  @xmath14 , @xmath15 being an integer number.@xcite these plateaus are known as shapiro steps and are the result of a synchronization process between the external driving frequency @xmath6 and the frequency of the junction @xmath16 .",

    "finally , the `` shapiro steps regime '' ( green and blue areas ) , is the region limited by @xmath116 and @xmath117 . following the arguments presented above , we distinguish an inner blue region @xmath110 where we expect to observe the even steps only .",
    "increasing further @xmath5 , we expect to observe a crossover where odd steps appear together with even steps , with a dominating even steps contribution .",

    "nevertheless , this reasoning is vague and deserves a quantitative study .",
    "therefore , in order to understand this phenomenon we perform a perturbative approach to the equation of motion in the next section .",
    "we study two asymptotic limits of the 2s - rsj model that have experimental relevance .",
    "first , the low intensity limit @xmath32 is the limit where we can expect to observe only even shapiro steps even for @xmath8 .",
    "second , the high intensity limit , @xmath9 , where both steps are present . before entering into the study of the asymptotic limits , it is convenient to rewrite eq .   using dimensionless units .",

    "we use the 2s - rsj model to understand the relation between the dynamics of the junction and the width of the shapiro steps , and in particular we focus on the reasons that make the even steps dominate over the odd steps for a fixed ratio @xmath8 .",
    "this phenomenon @xcite is important because it has been observed in different experiments@xcite , and could help to determine the presence of topological superconductivity .",
    "we provide a qualitative explanation of this phenomenon in terms of the washboard potential , and obtain a phase diagram of the widths of the shapiro steps as a function of @xmath5 and @xmath20 .",
    "remarkably , using some elementary reasonings we find the range of ac - bias , i.e.  @xmath5 , where the non - linear dynamics of the junction causes a regime in which the even steps dominate over the odd steps .",
    "increasing further @xmath5 we expect to find a crossover to a situation where odd steps are present although even steps dominate . then , at very high values of @xmath5 , both contributions become comparable .    furthermore , we study analytically the shapiro step width as a function of @xmath6 in two different limits of @xmath5 : the low intensity limit @xmath32 , and the high intensity limit @xmath9 .",
