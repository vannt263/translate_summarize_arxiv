    "a number of recent developments are aimed at overcoming this limitation and are greatly contributing to the understanding of the physics of strongly correlated systems.@xcite in quantum cluster theories@xcite the @xmath0-dependence is introduced by considering a small number of sites , instead of the single correlated site of dmft , and embedding them in a bath , i.e. , a dynamical mean - field host determined self - consistently .",

    "the hybridizations are given by the two - step hopping processes that are lost when cutting the cluster out of the original lattice.,width=288 ]    the general cdmft hybridization sum - rule ( [ sumrule ] ) can be easily visualized : the integral over the brillouin - zone of the cluster projects the single - electron part of the full hamiltonian to the cluster ( see eqn .",
    "( [ hc ] ) ) .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath58 are thus the two - step hoppings that are possible on the cluster .",
    "likewise the integral over the hamiltonian squared gives the second moments , only that here the intermediate site is not restricted to the cluster .",
    "thus the sum - rule matrix is given by the second - order paths between cluster - sites that proceed via a site outside the cluster .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ sumrule3 ] .",
    "as a special case , for a single site we obtain the second equality in ( [ singlesite ] ) .",
    "the vanishing of a matrix element in the sum - rule only implies that the corresponding matrix element of the bath green matrix decays faster than @xmath59 for large @xmath60 . for a diagonal element , however , all terms in @xmath61 are positive .",
    "thus a vanishing sum means that all terms must be zero .",
    "hence the sum - rule implies that cluster - sites that are so far in the interior that they can not be reached by hopping from outside the cluster do not couple to bath and that all matrix elements of the bath green function involving such a site @xmath62 are given by @xmath63 for all @xmath60 . in that sense",
    "the bath hybridizes only to the surface of the cluster and we see that the hybridization - strength to these sites does not decrease for increasing cluster size @xmath2 .",

    "interestingly this means that for a @xmath39-dimensional system in cdmft the overall coupling to the bath scales as @xmath78 , while in dca it scales as @xmath79 . for non - local properties a dca calculation is therefore expected to converge faster with cluster size.@xcite for a calculation where we represent the bath by discrete degrees of freedom this decrease in hybridization strength does , however , not help very much as we still need bath - sites to fit the hybridizations , even if they are small . with increasing dca cluster size we thus have to parametrize @xmath2 baths , one for each @xmath71 . in cdmft the situation is more fortunate , as the sum - rules imply that many hybridizations vanish and we only need to parametrize the coupling of surface - sites to the bath .",
    "the lack of translational invariance in cdmft has two important practical implications .",
    "first , the full green matrix has to be calculated , instead of just its diagonal .",
    "second , when calculating local quantities , like the density per site , in cdmft we have a choice of inequivalent sites , or we could consider the average over all sites . in a gapped system",
    "the best choice is the innermost site , @xcite however , in such a situation it might be better to do a straight lanczos calculation with @xmath12 cluster sites , instead of using @xmath3 bath sites.@xcite",
    "in the absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking the symmetries of the cluster ( point - symmetries in cdmft and additionally translation symmetry in dca ) are reflected in the green matrix . in a symmetry",
    "broken state with long - range order , like an antiferromagnet or a charge - density wave , the symmetry of the green matrix is accordingly lowered . to exploit this symmetry",
    "we introduce vectors on the cluster that transform according to its irreducible representations .",
    "we write these vectors as @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the irreducible representation and @xmath82 counts linear independent vectors transforming according to @xmath81 . on an @xmath2-site cluster",
    "we can choose @xmath2 such vectors that are orthonormal . defining the matrix @xmath83 of these vectors , we can block - diagonalize the bath green matrix : @xmath84 has blocks of dimension @xmath85 corresponding to the different irreducible representations @xmath81 . since @xmath84 is block diagonal for all @xmath60 , it follows from equation ( [ diagbath ] ) , that @xmath86 must also block - diagonalize the individual hybridization matrices @xmath87 .",
    "therefore the hybridization vectors must transform according to an irreducible representation : they can be written as @xmath88 for some irreducible representation @xmath81 . if the @xmath31 also had components @xmath89 of a different irreducible representation @xmath90 this would produce a hybridization matrix that could not be block - diagonalized .",
    "we thus find that the bath - sites can be arranged into sets corresponding to the different irreducible representations . for fitting a block of the symmetrized bath green matrix",
    "we need then only consider bath - sites of the respective irreducible representation .",
    "if the block is one - dimensional we can choose the corresponding hybridization real .",
    "an early example is the bonding - antibonding transformation introduced in reference .      as an example we consider a linear cluster of 3 sites as shown in figure [ bath3 ] .",

    "we can conclude that a cluster replica gives rise to @xmath85 bath - sites of symmetry @xmath81 . by working with cluster replica we thus sacrifice the freedom of choosing the irreducible representations for the bath individually .",
    "moreover , it is not straightforward to find a proper parametrization .",
    "@xmath143 must be chosen such that all accidental degeneracies can be lifted . for symmetries with higher - dimensional irreducible representations there will be , however , corresponding essential degeneracies . moreover , working with cluster replica , we can not fit the individual blocks of the bath green matrix with the minimal set of symmetry - adapted parameters , but have to solve the optimization problem for the full bath green matrix and all parameters .",
    "thus , using cluster replica is less flexible than using individual irreducible representations and it leads to a more complicated fitting procedure , in particular when considering large baths .",
    "we now discuss the one - dimensional hubbard model , for which exact results are available from the bethe ansatz@xcite and which has been studied with cdmft using lanczos@xcite and qmc,@xcite as well as with the variational cluster approximation.@xcite here going from single - site dmft to a cluster description makes a qualitative difference : for a paramagnetic single - site calculation antiferromagnetism is completely suppressed , while on a cluster we will have short - ranged antiferromagnetic correlations , even if we impose a paramagnetic bath .",
    "this inclusion of antiferromagnetic correlations might well be the cause for the spectacular difference between the single - site and 2-site cdmft calculations of the density as a function chemical potential reported in reference . for illustration , in fig .",
    "[ afsinglesite ] , we compare the density as a function of the chemical potential for a single - site calculation with paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic bath.@xcite they represent two limiting cases , the former being always metallic , the latter yielding a gap , which is overestimated as we are using an antiferromagnetic bath to mimic the short - ranged correlations present in the hubbard chain .",

    "the af curve comprises a left and a right branch : the left one has been obtained by fixing the magnetization from 0.01 to 0.82 ( from left to right ) and determining the chemical potential .",
    "the right branch has been obtained by just decreasing the chemical potential from the half - filling value ( @xmath151 ) down to the point where convergence is no longer found ( @xmath152 ) .",
