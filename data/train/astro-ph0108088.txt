    "it is my sincere pleasure to be able to present a talk at this conference in honor of dr .",
    "ray weymann and his many contributions to astronomy . rather than",
    "delve into a lengthy description of the known properties of high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) , i will instead concentrate on some recent observational results that provide new information about hvcs that you may not have heard about before .",
    "i hope that this talk stimulates as much discussion about what we do not yet know about hvcs as it does about what we do know .",
    "first , a very brief introduction to hvcs is in order . despite their simple name ,",
    "high velocity clouds have a long history of being contentious subjects of debate .",
    "most hvcs have been identified through their  21 cm emission , which occurs at velocities well outside the range expected for typical interstellar clouds ( typically , @xmath0 kms@xmath1 ) . within the last decade it has also been possible to study hvcs in absorption using ultraviolet spectrographs in space .",
    "some of these clouds have been confirmed to be galactic in nature since they are observed in the absorption - line spectra of stars at known distances .",
    "others , such as the magellanic stream , are clearly located outside the normally recognized confines of the galaxy . the case for an extragalactic origin of some  hvcs",
    "has been presented recently by several authors ( e.g. , blitz et al .",
    "1999 ; braun & burton 1999 ; see also gibson et al . - this volume - for additional references and a concise discussion of the pros and cons of an extragalactic location for hvcs )",
    ". there are several comprehensive reviews of the sky distribution of hvcs and the known properties and locations of some of the better - studied clouds ( wakker & van  woerden 1997 ; wakker 2001 ) .",
    "much of what is known about the kinematics , morphologies , and angular projections of hvcs onto the sky comes from  21 cm emission studies .",
    "however , many hvcs are now known to contain significant quantities of ionized gas .",
    "the ionized gas has been traced through both its h@xmath2 emission ( e.g. , bland - hawthorn et al . 1998 ; tufte , reynolds , & haffner 1998 ) and its absorption - line signatures in ionized species such as ciii - iv , siiii - iv , and ( e.g. , sembach et al .",
    "1999 ; sembach et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the existence of an ionized component to the high velocity cloud system has several obvious ramifications .",
    "first , it indicates that there is material in a form that heretofore has not been readily observed .",
    "the extent of this ionized gas is presently unknown , although new h@xmath2 imaging techniques hold great promise for revealing very low levels of emission regardless of the distances of the clouds ( e.g. , glazebrook & bland - hawthorn 2001 ) .",
    "second , the ionization of this gas must be maintained by an energy source either internal or external to the hvcs .",
    "since there are as yet no known stars that emit significant numbers of ionizing photons directly associated with hvcs , it seems likely that most of the energy must come either from photons emanating from somewhere outside the clouds or from collisional processes occurring between the clouds and other interstellar or intergalactic material .",
    "third , the detection of high velocity  along many sight lines through the milky way halo ( sembach et al .",
    "2000 , 2001c ; savage et al .",
    "2001 ) suggests that there may be dynamical interactions between some hvcs and a hot galactic corona or local group medium .",
    "it is to this third point that the rest of this article is devoted .",
    "the study of highly ionized high velocity gas traced through   absorption became possible with the commissioning of the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( @xmath3 ) in late 1999 ( moos et al . 2000 ) .",
    "conversion of ov into  requires @xmath4  ev , an energy well above the heii absorption edge at 54.4  ev .",
    "is an excellent tracer of collisional processes at temperatures @xmath5k ( sutherland & dopita 1993 ) .",
    "has an observable resonance doublet at 1031.926 , 1037.617 .",
    "of the two lines , the stronger ( 1031.926 ) line is more frequently observed since the weaker line is often blended with other atomic and molecular lines ( e.g. ,  @xmath6 , @xmath7 , h@xmath8 ( 50 ) r(1 ) @xmath9 and h@xmath8 ( 50 ) p(1 ) @xmath10 ) .",
    "high velocity absorption in the  1031.926   line can be blended with nearby h@xmath8 ( 60 ) p(3 ) absorption at 1031.191  ( 214 kms@xmath1 ) and ( 60 ) r(4 ) absorption at 1032.349  ( + 122 kms@xmath1 ) .",
    "when a comparison between both members of the  doublet has been possible in the milky way halo and hvc studies to date , the results have indicated that there is no unresolved saturated structure in the lines at @xmath3 resolution ( fwhm  @xmath11 kms@xmath1 ) .",
    "this result is consistent with production of the  in collisionally - ionized gas at temperatures @xmath12k .",
    "examples of the  @xmath13 absorption in several high velocity clouds observed by @xmath3 are shown in figure  1 .",
    "these include the magellanic stream , complex c , and hvcs believed to be located outside the galaxy in the local group .",
    "absorptions from both the milky way halo and the high velocity gas are evident .",
    "the faint solid grey line overplotted on each spectrum is a model of the h@xmath8 absorption features expected in the velocity range shown ( see sembach et al .",
    "the  hvcs in figure  1 are relatively well - separated from the lower velocity absorption .",
    "they occur at velocities similar to those of lower ionization species ( such as  or ) and have strengths ranging from @xmath14 ( tons210 ) to @xmath15 ( ngc7469 ) times the strength of the milky way halo absorption .",
    "a second type of high velocity gas detected in  absorption occurs along some sight lines through the milky way halo .",
    "figure  2 shows an example of a high velocity  absorption wing in the direction of 3c273 ( sembach et al .",
    "this feature is shallow and very broad , roughly 150 kms@xmath1  in width .",
    "the absorption is present in data obtained in multiple @xmath3 channels and has no counterpart in lower ionization species .",
    "the column of  contained in this wing is approximately 10% of the total column along the sight line .",
    "these high velocity wings are seen along several other sight lines currently under study and will be described in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the favored interpretation for the high velocity wing toward 3c273 is that the absorption traces the expulsion of hot gas out of the galactic disk into the halo in the loop  i / loop  iv region of the sky .",
    "the high ion ratios observed are consistent with the expectations for radiatively cooling gas in a fountain flow or supernova remnant ( see sembach et al .",
    "2001c ) .",
    "most of the  hvcs studied so far have readily identifiable counterparts in . in the case of at least one large hvc , that of complex c",
    ", the  absorption along several sight lines through the hvc traces the  velocity structure quite well .",
    "figure  3 shows the @xmath13 absorption toward four complex  c sight lines together with the  21 cm emission profiles  observed with the nrao 140-foot telescope and the feii @xmath16 profiles observed with @xmath3 .",
    "the  emission velocities and strengths change substantially across complex  c. for the four sight lines shown , the complex  c  velocities range from @xmath17 kms@xmath1  toward mrk876 to @xmath18 kms@xmath1  toward mrk817 .",
    "( this sight line pair has the smallest angular separation of the set , @xmath19 . )",
    "the  @xmath13 absorption profiles clearly reveal gas at the complex  c velocities traced by  and feii .",
    "the  profiles are smoother than the  emission or low ionization absorption , but track the neutral gas well ; there appears to be a strong correlation between the   velocity structure and the velocity structure of lower ionization stages .",
    "the  hvc line strength is roughly comparable along the mrk817 , mrk279 , and pg1259 + 593 sight lines , while the strength toward mrk876 is about a factor of two higher .",
    "the opposite is true for the hvc  emission ; the strength of the emission toward mrk876 is less than that along the other three sight lines .",
    "we show a second comparison of the  and low ionization lines in another hvc in figure  4 .",
    "this hvc , observed along the ngc1705 sight line ( @xmath20 ) , traces material associated with the magellanic stream near the lmc ( see sembach et al .",
    "this hvc has a multi - component structure as revealed by the space telescope imaging spectrograph data shown in figure  4 .",
    "multiple ionized gas components traced by siiii @xmath21 are spread over a velocity range of @xmath22140 kms@xmath1 .",
    "the  absorption is centered near the velocity of the strongest low ionization component traced by the oi @xmath23 line . furthermore , the  tracks closely the high velocity ( @xmath24 kms@xmath1 ) absorption wing seen siiii , suggesting either that there is a hot component of the cloud centered on the strongest low ionization component , or that there is a highly ionized leading edge to the cloud .",
    "the width of the  absorption ( fwhm @xmath25 kms@xmath1 ) is much broader than expected for a single - component gas at @xmath26k , suggesting that the   may trace multiple hot gas components or that the the absorption is broadened by non - thermal motions having velocities on the order of 50 kms@xmath1 .",
    "the answer to this question is still being sought . however , from the information that is now available , it seems quite likely that _ some _ of the  hvcs are tracing material in the vicinity of the milky way rather than material within the milky way .",
    "several lines of evidence support this conclusion : + 1 )  absorption is observed in several large hvcs known to lie at large distances from the galactic plane ( e.g. , the magellanic stream ) .",
    "other excellent candidates for hvcs located in the distant galactic halo or local group based on their ionization properties or abundances include the civ hvcs toward mrk  509 ( sembach et al .",
    "1999 ) and complex  c ( wakker et al . 1999 ) .",
    "+ 2 )  has been observed in the compact hvc toward tons210 ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "this detection is significant since many of the observed properties of compact hvcs are best described if they are extragalactic clouds within the local group .",
    "the compact hvcs have small angular sizes ( @xmath27 ) and are isolated .",
    "their velocity dispersion as a group of clouds is minimized in the local group standard of rest , and they have a spatial distribution similar to that of dwarf galaxies in the local group ( braun & burton 1999 ) .",
    "the compact hvc toward tons210 also has a sub - solar metallicity that is consistent with a location outside the galaxy , although a more definitive measure of the metallicity is required to exclude a galactic location ( sembach et al .",
    "+ 3 ) high velocity  absorption is observed along sight lines through the halo along extragalactic lines of sight ( e.g. , sembach et al .",
    "2000 ) . a much larger sample currently being analyzed in conjunction with the wisconsin group ( savage , wakker , richter ) indicates that high velocity  along extended paths through the halo and local group is common .",
    "however , there have not yet been any definitive detections of high velocity  observed toward halo stars located within a few kiloparsecs of the galactic plane  an early study by zsargo et al .",
    "( 2001 , and work in preparation ) of 1012 sight lines shows no evidence of high velocity .",
    "not all of the high velocity  is located at large distances from the galactic plane .",
    "the kinematics and high ion ratios suggest a galactic origin for the high velocity  wing toward 3c273 .",
    "furthermore ,  is observed at intermediate - high velocities in several other large - scale structures in both the milky way and the magellanic clouds : for example , the scutum supershell ( sterling et al .",
    "2001 ) and supernova remnant snr00577226 in the direction of hd5980 in the smc ( hoopes et al .",
    "the presence of  in hvcs indicates that the gas is collisionally ionized at temperatures of @xmath28k .",
    "photoionization by starlight is unlikely .",
    "photoionization by the extragalactic ultraviolet background may produce some , but not in the quantities observed .",
    "the typical  column densities predicted for large ( @xmath29 kpc ) low density ( @xmath30 @xmath31 ) clouds at @xmath32 are of the order of @xmath33 @xmath31 ( see sembach et al .",
    "1999 ) , an order of magnitude less than the typical column densities observed .",
    "the distances of the magellanic stream and complex  c are not likely to be large enough to accommodate higher columns produced by photoionization .",
    "the coincidence of neutral ( or weakly ionized ) gas at velocities similar to those of many of the  hvcs suggests that production of the  might involve contact interfaces between the cool / warm material and hot ( @xmath34k ) gas .",
    "this hotter gas may take the form of a pervasive , hot galactic halo or local group medium with a density @xmath35 @xmath31 .",
    "alternatively , the  may trace cooling regions of hot gas structures associated with the assembly of the milky way . additional stis data for the  hvcs observed by @xmath3 would help to constrain the various ionization mechanisms in the clouds .",
    "i would like to thank and acknowledge my collaborators on various aspects of this work , each of whom have contributed to the results presented in this paper : blair savage , tim heckman , claus leitherer , brad gibson , and mary putman .",
    "i also thank the @xmath3 operations team at the johns hopkins university for their outstanding efforts in making @xmath3 a superb far - ultraviolet observatory .",
    "finally , i thank john mulchaey and the other workshop organizers for making this a truly enjoyable and memorable meeting ."
