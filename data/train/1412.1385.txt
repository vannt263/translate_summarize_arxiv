    "this did not affect the asymmetry of the lineshape , indicating that an inhomogenous mw field in the cavity could not be the cause of the observed effect .    to investigate the effect of sample geometry further , a set of samples of dimensions 1@xmath63 mm ,",
    "where l ranged from 0.5 to 4 mm was studied .",
    "the samples were again of 10 nm py capped with 10 nm cu , and 5 nm ta to prevent oxidation .",
    "we notice that the sample length in the direction parallel to the applied field is the main parameter that determines the asymmetry of the fmr lineshapes , given by the parameter @xmath15 .",
    "figure [ fig : rot_length_thick]b shows the dependence of sample length when the varying dimension is parallel to the applied field .",
    "we see that the asymmetry increases with the sample s length and reaches a value where @xmath15 appears to diverge at a length of about 3.3 mm .",

    "[ fig : rot_length_thick]a ) , suggest that the effective driving field has the dominating contribution oriented in the sample plane ; the contribution from the component perpendicular to the sample plane should not depend on the direction of the sample edges with respect to the applied field . as the effective driving field appears to be dominated by the in plane components",
    ", this indicates that the induced local field perturbing the fm is larger than the external field",
    ". this could be possible due to the close proximity to the induced currents at the fm / nm interface .",
    "we now compare the length series with the rotational measurements by using a simple geometric approximation : we consider that the length of the sample parallel to the applied field is given by @xmath60 , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the length ( 3 mm ) and width ( 1 mm ) of the sample , and @xmath56 corresponds to the applied field parallel to the short side of the sample .",

    "the expression for the induced field is thus proportional to the sample size .    as an estimate for the strength of the induced field",
    ", we calculated this for a square sample , @xmath77 , using the above expression for @xmath78 .",
    "the sheet resistance was measured to be @xmath79 for samples with 10 nm py capped by 10 nm cu and 5 nm ta .",

    ", we obtained that at a dimension of about 2@xmath552 mm the induced field equals the mw field .",
    "our estimate corresponds with what we see in the experiments : when the sample size approaches the mm scale , the effects become increasingly important .",
    "next , we focus on another important parameter that governs the effect of eddy currents : the thickness of the nm layer .",

    "however , for nm layers in this thickness regime , the conductivity depends strongly on the thickness .",
    "this is due to increased interface scattering in thin films when the thickness is of the same order as the electron mean free path . due to this we estimate the film resistance , @xmath98 , as a function of thickness by introducing a correction factor , @xmath99 , which describes a correction to the film conductivity compared to its bulk value . in @xcite",
    "it was found that the increase in conductivity is close to linear in film thickness below 20 - 30 nm , before reaching an asymptotic value for thicker films . in our calculations we thus considered @xmath99 to be a linear function of the film thickness below 20 nm : @xmath100 , where @xmath91 is the nm thickness and we set @xmath101 nm .    from the rotational measurements",
