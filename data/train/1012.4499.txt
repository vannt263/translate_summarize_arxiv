    "cold atoms in optical lattices provide us with an excellent tool to investigate notoriously difficult problems in condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "recent progress towards this goal is exemplified by the experimental observation of the fermionic mott insulator @xcite in a binary mixture of repulsively interacting @xmath2 atoms loaded into an optical lattice , and of the crossover between bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) superfluidity and bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) @xcite in a mixture of @xmath3 atoms with attractive interactions .    at the same time , ultracold quantum gases also allow us to investigate systems which have no immediate counterparts in condensed matter .",
    "this is the case for fermionic mixtures where three internal states @xmath4 are used , instead of the usual binary mixtures that mimic the electronic spin @xmath5 .",
    "these multi - species fermi mixtures are already available in the laboratory , where three different magnetic sublevels of @xmath6 @xcite or @xmath7 @xcite , as well as a mixture of the two internal states of @xmath3 with a lowest hyperfine state of @xmath2@xcite have been successfully trapped . in the case of alkali atoms ,",
    "magnetic or optical fano - feshbach resonances can be used to tune magnitude and sign of the interactions in the system , and in the case of ytterbium or group ii atoms , it is possible to realise three - component mixtures where the components differ only by nuclear spin , and therefore exhibit su(3 ) symmetric interactions @xcite . moreover , loading these mixtures into an optical lattice would give experimental access to intriguing physical scenarios , since they can realize a three - species hubbard model with a high degree of control of the hamiltonian parameters .",
    "multi - species hubbard models have attracted considerable interest on the theoretical side in recent years .",
    "first studies were focused on the @xmath1-symmetric version of the model with attractive interaction . by using a generalized bcs approach @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the ground state at weak - coupling spontaneously breaks the @xmath8 symmetry down to @xmath9 , giving rise to a color superfluid ( c - sf ) phase , where superfluid pairs coexist with unpaired fermions . within a variational gutzwiller technique @xcite the superfluid phase",
    "was then found to undergo for increasing attraction a phase transition to a fermi liquid trionic phase , where bound states ( trions ) of the three different species are formed and the @xmath1-symmetry is restored .",
    "more recently @xcite , the same scenario has been found by using a self - energy functional approach for the half - filled model on a bethe lattice in dimension @xmath10 . it was suggested @xcite that this transition bears analogies to the transition between quark superfluid and baryonic phase in the context of quantum chromo dynamics .",
    "both the attractive and the repulsive version of the model was addressed by numerical and analytical techniques for the peculiar case of spatial dimension @xmath11 @xcite , while mott physics and instabilities towards ( colored ) density wave formation have been found in the repulsive case in higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "it is important to mention that substantial differences are expected in the attractive case at strong coupling when the lattice is not present @xcite .",
    "those differences are essentially related to the influence of the lattice in the strong coupling limit in the three - body problem , favoring trion formation @xcite with respect to pair formation in the continuum , as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "here we consider the @xmath1-symmetric system in a lattice for @xmath0 in the presence of attractive two - body interactions by combining dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) and variational monte carlo ( vmc ) .",
    "we analyze several cases of interest for commensurate and incommensurate density .",
    "ground state , spectral , and finite temperature properties are addressed .",
    "more specifically we focus on the transition between color superfluid and trionic phase and on a better understanding of the coexistence of magnetism and superfluidity in the color superfluid phase already predicted in the @xmath1 symmetric case @xcite but also when the @xmath1-symmetry is explicitly broken @xcite .",
    "we show that the existence of a spontaneous magnetization leads the system to separate in color superfluid domains with different realizations of color pairing and magnetizations whenever the total number of particles in each hyperfine state is conserved .",
    "this would represent a special case , due to the underlying @xmath1 symmetry , of a more general tendency towards phase separation in three - component fermi mixtures .",
    "we point out that all this rich and interesting physics arises merely from having three components instead of two .",
    "indeed the analogous @xmath12 system would give rise to the more conventional bcs - bec crossover , where the superfluid ground state evolves continuously for increasing attraction @xcite .",
    "moreover in the @xmath12 case superfluidity directly competes with magnetism @xcite .",
    "the case under investigation can be realized with ultracold gases by loading a three - species mixture of @xmath7 @xcite or another group ii element such as @xmath13sr into an optical lattice , or alternatively using @xmath3 in a large magnetic field .",
    "however , some realizations with ultracold atoms are plagued by three - body losses due to three - body efimov resonances @xcite , which are not any more pauli suppressed as in the two - species case .",
    "the three - body loss properties and their dependence on the magnetic field have been already measured for @xmath3 @xcite , while they are still unknown for three - component mixtures of certain group - ii elements . loading a gas into an optical lattice could be used to suppress losses , as a large rate of onsite three - body loss can prevent coherent tunneling processes from populating any site with three particles @xcite . as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite for bosonic systems , in the strong loss regime a hamiltonian formulation is still possible if one includes an effective hard - core three - body interaction , which leads to new interesting physics @xcite .",
    "the effect of this dynamically generated constraint on the fermionic system in @xmath11 with attractive interactions was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that the constraint may help to stabilize the superfluid phase in some regions of the phase diagram .    for these reasons",
    "we also study the effect of including a three - body constraint in the model , as representative of an @xmath1 symmetric mixture in the strong - loss regime . the asymmetric case in the strong loss regime , which is directly relevant for experiments on @xmath3 close to a feshbach resonance , has been already addressed in a separate publication @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the following sections we first introduce the model ( sec .",
    "[ model ] ) and then the methods used ( sec . [ methods ] ) . later on we present our results , focusing first on the unconstrained system ( sec .",
    "[ unconstrained ] ) , for commensurate and incommensurate densities and then on the effects of the three - body constraint ( sec . [ constrained ] ) .",
    "the emergence of domain formation within globally _ balanced _ mixtures is discussed in detail in sec .",
    "[ phase_separation ] .",
    "final remarks are drawn in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "three - component fermi mixtures with attractive two - body interactions loaded into an optical lattice are well described by the following hamiltonian @xmath14 where @xmath4 denotes the different components , @xmath15 is the hopping parameter between nearest neighbor sites @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the chemical potential for the species @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we introduced the onsite density operators @xmath20 .",
    "the three - body interaction term with @xmath21 is introduced to take the effects of three - body losses in the strong loss regime into account according to refs .",
    "@xmath22 corresponds to the case when three - body losses are negligible . while the model and the methods are developed for the general case without @xmath1-symmetry , in this paper we concentrate on the @xmath1-symmetric case reflected by species - independent parameters @xmath23 in this case the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) reduces to an @xmath1 attractive hubbard model if @xmath22 .",
    "note that the three - body interaction term is a color singlet and thus does not break @xmath1 for any choice of @xmath24 . on the basis of previous works , the ground state of the unconstrained model",
    "is expected to be , at least in the weak coupling regime , a color superfluid , i.e. a phase where the full @xmath25 symmetry of the hamiltonian is spontaneously broken to @xmath9 @xcite . as shown in @xcite",
    ", it is always possible to find a suitable gauge transformation such that pairing takes place only between two of the natural species @xmath18 , @xmath26 and in this paper we choose a gauge in which pairing takes place between the species @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 channel ) , while the third species stays unpaired . whenever the @xmath1-symmetry is _ explicitly _ broken , only the pairing between the natural species is allowed to comply with ward - takahashi identities @xcite .",
    "this reduces the continuum set of equivalent pairing channels of the symmetric model to a discrete set of three ( _ mutually exclusive _ ) options for pairing , i.e. @xmath30 or @xmath31 . in this case",
    "the natural choice would be that pairing takes place in the channel corresponding to the strongest coupling when the mixture is globally balanced .",
    "we can always relabel the species such that strongest attractive channel is the channel @xmath29 .",
    "other pairing channels can be studied via index permutations of the species .",
    "therefore the formalism developed here is fully general and includes both the symmetric and non - symmetric case , while only in the @xmath1-symmetric case our approach corresponds to a specific choice of the gauge .",
    "in order to investigate the model in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) in spatial dimensions @xmath32 we use a combination of numerical techniques which have proven to give very consistent results for the non - symmetric case @xcite .",
    "in particular , we use dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) for @xmath33 and variational monte carlo ( vmc ) for @xmath34 .",
    "dmft provides us with the exact solution in infinite dimension and a powerful ( and non - perturbative ) approach in @xmath35 , which has the advantage of being directly implemented in the thermodynamic limit ( without finite size effects ) .",
    "vmc allows us to incorporate also the effect of spatial fluctuations which are not included within dmft , even though the exponential growth of the hilbert space limits the system sizes that are accessible .",
    "dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) is a non - perturbative technique based on the original idea of metzner and vollhardt who studied the limit of infinite dimension of the hubbard model @xcite . in this limit , the self - energy @xmath36 becomes momentum independent @xmath37 , while fully retaining its frequency dependence .",
    "therefore the many - body problem simplifies significantly , without becoming trivial , and can be solved exactly . in this sense dmft is a _",
    "quantum _ version of the static mean - field theory for classical systems , since it becomes exact in the same limiting case ( @xmath10 ) and can provide useful information also outside of this limit , fully including local quantum fluctuations . in 3d , assuming a momentum independent self - energy , has proved to be a very accurate approximation for many problems where the momentum dependence is not crucial to describe the physics of the system such as the mott metal - insulator transition @xcite where the frequency dependence is more relevant than the @xmath38 dependence .      in this work ,",
    "we generalize the dmft approach to multi - species fermi mixtures in order to describe color superfluid and trionic phases , which are the expected phases occurring in the system .",
    "the theory can be formulated in terms of a set of self - consistency equations for the components of the local single - particle green function @xmath39 on the lattice .",
    "since we are dealing here with superfluid phases involving also anomalous components of the green function , we use a compact notation in terms of mixed nambu spinors @xmath40 , where we already assumed that pairing takes place only between the first two species , as explained in the previous section , and we omit the subscript @xmath41 ( spatially homogeneous solution ) .",
    "we reiterate that this specific choice is valid without loss of generality in the @xmath1-symmetric model , and has the same status as fixing the phase of a complex condensate order parameter in theories with global phase symmetry .",
    "the local green function @xmath42 in matsubara space then has the form @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are respectively the normal and anomalous green functions in imaginary time , and @xmath46 and @xmath47 are their fourier transforms in matsubara space , where @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) .    in practice the original lattice model ( [ hamiltonian ] ) in the dmft approach can be mapped , by introducing auxiliary fermionic degrees of freedom @xmath50 , on a single impurity anderson model ( siam ) , whose hamiltonian reads @xmath51   + \\sum_{l } w_{l}\\left[a_{l,1}^{\\dagger}a_{l,2}^{\\dagger}+h.c.\\right ]   , \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the anderson parameters @xmath52 have to be determined self - consistently .",
    "self - consistency ensures that the impurity green function of the siam is identical to the local component of the lattice green function .",
    "the components of the non - interacting green function for the impurity site , which represent the dynamical analog of the weiss field in classical statistical mechanics , can be expressed in terms of the anderson parameters as @xmath53 where @xmath54 .",
    "the self - consistency equations for the local green functions now have the form @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the number of lattice sites , @xmath57 is the lattice green function within dmft and @xmath58 is the density of states of the lattice under consideration .",
    "the independent components of @xmath59 have the form @xmath60 where @xmath61 and the self - energy can be obtained by the following local dyson equation @xmath62 where @xmath63    once a self - consistent solution has been obtained , the impurity site of the siam represents a generic site of the lattice model under investigation .",
    "therefore several static thermodynamic quantities can be directly evaluated as quantum averages of the impurity site . as evident from the previous equations",
    ", dmft is explicitly formulated in a grand canonical approach where the chemical potentials @xmath17 are given as input and the onsite densities @xmath64 are calculated .      to characterize the different phases",
    ", we evaluated several static observables such as the superfluid ( sf ) order parameter @xmath65 , the average double occupancy @xmath66 and the average triple occupancy @xmath67 .",
    "as suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite , in order to gain condensation energy in the c - sf phase , it is energetically favorable to induce a finite density imbalance between the paired species ( @xmath29 in our gauge ) and the unpaired fermions . to _",
    "quantitatively _ characterize this feature we introduce the local _ magnetization _",
    "@xmath68    from the normal components of the lattice green functions in eqs .",
    "( [ glatt1 ] ) , ( [ glatt2 ] ) and ( [ glatt3 ] ) we can extract the dmft momentum distribution @xmath69 and the average of kinetic energy per lattice site @xmath70 it is evident from the expression of @xmath59 given in eqs .",
    "( [ glatt1 ] ) , ( [ glatt2 ] ) and ( [ glatt3 ] ) that @xmath71 only depends on the momentum @xmath38 through the free - particle dispersion @xmath72 of the lattice at hand . the internal energy per lattice site @xmath73 can then be obtained as @xmath74 is the average potential energy per lattice site .",
    "solving the dmft equations is equivalent to solving a siam in presence of a bath determined self - consistently .",
    "we use exact diagonalization ( ed ) @xcite , which amounts to truncating the number of auxiliary degrees of freedom @xmath75 in the anderson model to a finite ( and small ) number @xmath76 . in this way",
    "the size of the hilbert space of the siam is manageable and we can exactly solve the anderson model numerically . here",
    "we would like to point out that this truncation does not reflect the size of the physical lattice but only the number of independent parameters used in the description of the local dynamics .",
    "therefore we always describe the system in the thermodynamic limit ( no finite - size effects ) .",
    "we use the lanczos algorithm @xcite to study the ground state properties ( up to @xmath77 ) and full ed for finite temperature ( up to @xmath78 ) . due to the increasing size of the hilbert space ( @xmath4 instead of @xmath79 ) in the multi - component case the typical values of @xmath80 which can be handled sensibly",
    "is smaller than the corresponding values for the @xmath12 superfluid case .",
    "however , in thermodynamic quantities , we found indeed only a very weak dependence on the value of @xmath80 and the results within full ed at the lowest temperatures are in close agreement with @xmath81 calculations within lanczos .",
    "a definite advantage of ed is that it allows us to directly calculate dynamical observables for real frequencies without need of analytical continuation from imaginary time . in particular",
    ", we can directly extract the local single - particle green function @xmath82 and the single - particle spectral function @xmath83      the variational monte carlo ( vmc ) techniques described in this subsection can be used to calculate the energies and correlation functions of the homogeneous phases at @xmath81 in a canonical framework .",
    "the basic ingredients of the vmc formalism are the hamiltonian and trial wavefunctions with an appropriate symmetry . in principle",
    ", the formalism presented here can be applied to any dimension , even though here we use it specifically to address the system on a two - dimensional square lattice .    the canonical version of hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) for three - components fermions with generic attractive interactions is given by @xmath84 where the three - body constraint is imposed by using the projector @xmath85 and in the unconstrained case we set @xmath86 equal to the identity .",
    "practical limitations do not permit a general trial wave function equally accurate both for the weak- and the strong - coupling limit .",
    "due to this reason we introduce different trial wavefunctions for different coupling regimes .    in the weakly interacting limit , which we operatively define as @xmath87 , we use the full hamiltonian ( [ eqn_hbare ] ) along with the weak - coupling trial wavefunction defined in the next subsection . here",
    "@xmath88 is the bandwidth . at strong - coupling this",
    "wavefunction results in a poor description of the system . in order to gain insight into the strong coupling regime",
    ", we derive below a perturbative hamiltonian to the second order in @xmath89 , which we will combine with a strong - coupling trial wavefunction . again",
    "the strong - coupling wavefunctions are incompatible with the hamiltonian ( [ eqn_hbare ] ) , as will be clarified below .",
    "we can therefore address confidently both limits of the model while at intermediate coupling we expect our vmc results to be less accurate .      in order to derive a perturbative strong - coupling hamiltonian for the constrained case we make use of the wolff - schrieffer transformation @xcite @xmath90 and keep terms up to the second order in @xmath89 . in the expression above , @xmath91 is the projection operator to the hilbert subspace with fixed numbers of double occupancies in each channel ( @xmath92 , @xmath93,@xmath94 ) , and @xmath95 is a unitary transformation defined in [ appendix ] .",
    "so we obtain the perturbative hamiltonian ( see [ appendix ] ) , which reads : @xmath96 where @xmath97 . here",
    "we define double occupancy operators as @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) and single occupancy operators as @xmath100 .    for the case",
    "where the @xmath1-symmetry is restored ( @xmath101 ) , the perturbative hamiltonian can be written in a compact notation @xmath102   - \\frac{j^2}{u } \\sum\\limits_{\\langle i',i \\rangle ; \\langle i , j \\rangle;\\sigma } d^\\dagger_{i',\\sigma } f_{i,\\sigma } f^\\dagger_{i,\\sigma } d_{j,\\sigma } \\\\ & & \\hspace{-1.25 cm } - \\frac{j^2}{u } \\sum\\limits_{\\langle i , j ' \\rangle ; \\langle i , j \\rangle;\\sigma'\\ne\\sigma } d^\\dagger_{i,\\sigma ' } f_{j',\\sigma ' } f^\\dagger_{i,\\sigma } d_{j,\\sigma }   + \\frac{j^2}{u } \\sum\\limits_{\\langle i',i \\rangle\\sigma ' ; \\langle i , j \\rangle\\sigma } f^\\dagger_{i',\\sigma ' } d_{i,\\sigma ' } d^\\dagger_{i,\\sigma } f_{j,\\sigma }   +   { \\cal o}(\\frac{j^3}{u^2 } ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the double occupancy operator is now defined as @xmath103 .    now , rather than conserving the number of double occupancies @xmath104 in each channel , only the total number @xmath105 is conserved due to the @xmath1-symmetry . indeed",
    "( [ eqn_pert2 ] ) contains terms where the tightly bound dimers are allowed to change the composition through second order processes .",
    "thus , the @xmath1-symmetric case , in contrast to the case with strongly anisotropic interactions is qualitatively different from the bose - fermi mixture , because the bosons - tightly bound dimers - can change composition as described above , while such a process was not allowed in the case of the strong anisotropic interactions .",
    "we also notice that the last of the @xmath106 terms contributes only when @xmath107 .      without the 3-body constraint three fermions with different hyperfine states",
    "can occupy the same lattice site and we expect them to form trionic bound states at sufficiently strong coupling",
    ". correspondingly the many - body system should be in a trionic phase with heavy trionic quasiparticles , as mentioned in previous studies @xcite .",
    "therefore we expect that our perturbative approach can provide a description of the trions in the strong coupling limit .",
    "first we consider the extreme case @xmath108 . in this limit formation of local trions",
    "takes place , i.e each site is either empty or occupied by three fermions with different hyperfine spins .",
    "their spatial distribution is random , because any distribution of trions will have the same energy . for finite @xmath15 with @xmath109",
    "the hopping term can break a local trion , but this would result in a large energy penalty .    according to perturbation theory up to third order we could have two different contributions : ( i ) one of the fermions hops to one of the neighboring sites and returns back to the original site ( second order perturbation ) , ( ii ) all three fermions hop to the same nearest neighbor site ( third order perturbation ) . as we show below , due to the first process",
    "there is an effective interaction between trions on nearest neighbor sites .",
    "also due to this process the onsite energy has to be renormalized . the second process ( ii ) describes the hopping of a local trions to a neighboring site .",
    "after straightfroward calculations ( see [ appendix ] ) we obtain that the effective interaction between two trions on neighboring sites is @xmath110 for the @xmath1-symmetric case this expression is simplified and we obtain @xmath111 therefore the nearest - neighbour interaction between trions is repulsive in the @xmath1-symmetric case .    for the hopping coefficient",
    "we obtain @xmath112 where @xmath18 , @xmath26 and @xmath113 are different from each other in the sum .    in the @xmath1-symmetric case , the expression again simplifies to @xmath114    so we obtain the following effective hamiltonian @xcite @xmath115 here @xmath116 is the creation operator of a local trion at lattice site @xmath41 and @xmath117 is the trionic number operator . because the effective hopping of trions results from a third order process and the interaction from second order , more precisely @xmath118 , the effective trion theory is interaction dominated .",
    "since the interaction describes nearest - neighbour repulsion , the strong coupling limit clearly favors a checkerboard charge density wave ground state at half - filling , which we will discuss in more detail in sec .",
    "[ unconstrained ] .      in order to describe a normal fermi liquid phase without superfluid pairing , we use the following trial wavefunction @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the vacuum state and @xmath121 for a 2d square lattice with only nearest - neighbor hopping .",

    "the system is superfluid and the magnetization finite . with increase of the temperature , both @xmath146 and @xmath162 decrease and then vanish _ simultaneously _ at the critical temperature @xmath290 .",

    "[ pd_constraint_n0.48 ] ) , the c - sf is partially magnetized and therefore intrinsically different from the case with only two species .",
    "this is also visible in the behavior of the critical temperature where the @xmath1-symmetry is restored in the normal phase .",
    "we found indeed that the critical temperature first increases with the interaction strength @xmath161 , similarly to the @xmath12 case .",

    "this power - law behavior only appears for very large @xmath161 ( bosonic limit ) @xcite , while in the @xmath1 case this regime occurs _ immediately _ for @xmath302 .",
    "the smooth crossover in @xmath303 and the maximum of in the critical temperature characteristic of the @xmath12 case , here are replaced by a cusp at @xmath300 , which marks the abrupt transition from one regime to the other .",
    "one of the main results of this work is the close connection between superfluidity and magnetization in the c - sf phase .",
    "indeed we found that in the c - sf phase , away from the particle - hole symmetric point , the magnetization is always non - zero . on the other hand ultracold gas experiments",
    "are usually performed under conditions where the global number of particles @xmath304 in each hyperfine state is conserved , provided spin flip processes are suppressed .",
    "the aim of this section is to show that domain formation provides a way to reconcile our findings with these circumstances . in particular , combining dmft and vmc findings , we will show that a globally homogeneous c - sf phase is unstable with respect to formation of domains with different c - sf phases in the thermodynamic limit .    to be more specific , we will consider the case when the global numbers of particles in each species are the same , i.e. @xmath305 , at @xmath81 , though the discussion can be easily generalized to other cases .",
    "the simplest solution compatible with @xmath306 is clearly a non - polarized c - sf phase with energy @xmath307 per lattice site .",
    "this phase is actually unstable and therefore not accessible in a grand canonical approach like dmft , where we fix the global chemical potential @xmath218 and calculate the particle densities @xmath278 as an output .",
    "since , as shown in sec .",
    "[ unconstrained ] and sec .",
    "[ constrained ] , the system is _ spontaneously _ magnetized in the color superfluid phase out of half - filling , there is no way to reconcile the dmft result with the global constraint @xmath306 assuming the presence of a single homogeneous phase .",
    "the vmc approach , on the other hand , operates in the canonical ensemble , and it can be used to estimate the ground state energy per lattice site for specific trial configurations . for the homogeneous configuration , we have @xmath308 , where @xmath309 and @xmath56 is the number of lattice sites .",
    "+    let us now contrast this situation with the spatially non - uniform scenario in which we have many color superfluid domains in equilibrium .",
    "each of these domains corresponds to one of the solutions obtained above , and therefore this phenomenon can be seen as a special form of phase separation . for two or more phases to be in thermodynamic equilibrium with each other at @xmath81 ,",
    "they need to have the same value of the grand potential per lattice site @xmath310 for the same given value of the chemical potential @xmath218 , while the onsite density of particles for each species @xmath278 can be different in the different phases .",
    "possible candidate phases for the system considered in this paper are suggested by the underlying @xmath1-symmetry .",
    "indeed if we consider c - sf solutions corresponding to different gauge fixing , i.e. with pairing in different channels , they will have the same total onsite density @xmath138 and therefore the same energy and grand potential , since they correspond to different realizations of the spontaneously broken symmetry . if we consider for simplicity only the three solutions with pairing between the _ natural species _ sketched in fig .",
    "[ ps ] , then this mixture of phases has globally the same number of particles @xmath306 in each hyperfine state whenever we choose the fraction of each phase in the mixture to be @xmath311 and @xmath309 in each domain .",
    "in fact in each domain we have the same densities @xmath312 in the paired channel and @xmath313 for the unpaired fermions , even though they involve different species in different domains .",
    "this scenario is therefore compatible with the global number constraint @xmath306 and we can compare its energy with the energy @xmath307 of the globally homogeneous c - sf phase .",
    "the vmc calculations reported in fig .",
    "[ energy_difference ] clearly indicate that for a fixed onsite density @xmath138 , the ground state energy per lattice site is lower by having a finite magnetization , i.e. @xmath314 and therefore @xmath315 and @xmath316 is the energy per lattice site in the i - th domain .",
    "thus a globally homogeneous c - sf phase has higher energy than a mixture of polarized domains with the same @xmath299 and is therefore unstable with respect to phase separation .",
    "it should be noted however , that the configuration sketched in fig .",
    "[ ps ] only represents the _",
    "simplest possible _ scenario compatible with the global boundary conditions @xmath306 . indeed in the @xmath1-symmetric case we have continuous set of equivalent solutions , since solutions obtained continuously rotating the pairing state from 1 - 2 to a generic linear combination of species have the same energy and are therefore equally good candidates for the state with domain formation .",
    "moreover , it is well known that having a continuous symmetry breaking is intrinsically different from the discrete case , because of the presence of goldstone modes @xcite . in large but finite systems",
    ", the surface energy at the interface between domains , which is negligible in the thermodynamic limit , will become relevant .",
    "on one hand a continuous symmetry breaking allows the system to reduce the surface energy cost through an arbitrarily small change of the order parameter from domain to domain , pointing toward a scenario where a large number of domains is preferable in real systems . on the other hand , when the system is finite , increasing the number of domains decreases their extension , reducing the bulk contribution which eventually defines number and size of the domains at equilibrium .",
    "based on our current approaches , we can not address the issue of what is the real domain configuration in a finite system , neither the question if different scenarios with microscopical modulations of the sf order parameter take place @xcite .",
    "similar conclusions concerning the emergence of domain formation in the c - sf phase have been already drawn in @xcite and also in a very recent work @xcite , which addresses the same system in continuum space .    in real experiments",
    "both finite - size effects and inhomogeneities due to the trapping potential could play an important role in the actual realization of the presented scenario .",
    "furthermore , as the @xmath1-symmetry in the cold atomic systems is not fundamental but arises as a consequence of fine - tuning of the interaction parameters , imperfections will also arise from slight asymmetries in these parameters .",
    "we have shown before @xcite that in the strongly asymmetric limit , phase separation is a very robust phenomenon .",
    "we may therefore conjecture that interaction parameter asymmetries favor this scenario .",
    "the combination of the findings in the present paper on the @xmath1 case with those on the strongly - asymmetric case in @xcite suggests that phase - separation in globally _ balanced _ mixtures is a quite general feature of three - species fermi mixtures .",
    "however , the phases involved are in general different in different setups . in the strongly - asymmetric case in presence of a three - body constraint ,",
    "the color superfluid phase undergo a spatial separation in superfluid dimers and unpaired fermions @xcite . in this case , the presence of the constraint is crucial to the phase - separation phenomenon , as testified by its survival well above the critical temperature for the disappearance of the superfluid phase @xcite . in the fully @xmath1 symmetric case instead , the presence of the constraint only modifies the nature of the underlying color superfluid phase favoring fully polarized domains at strong coupling .",
    "the formation of many _ equivalent _ color superfluid domains can be seen as a special case of phase separation reflecting the @xmath1 symmetry . in this case the phase separation phenomenon is strongly connected to the superfluid and magnetic properties of the color superfluid phase and it is expected to disappear at the critical temperature @xmath296 and for the peculiar particle - hole symmetric point at half - filling in the unconstrained case .",
    "we have studied a su(3 ) attractively interacting mixture of three - species fermions in a lattice with and without a three - body constraint using dynamical mean - field theory ( @xmath317 ) and variational monte carlo techniques ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "we have investigated both ground state properties of the system and the effect of finite temperature and find a rich phase diagram .    for the unconstrained system",
    ", we found a phase transition from a color superfluid state to a trionic phase , which shows additional charge density modulation at half - filling .",
    "the superfluid order as well as cdw disappear with increasing temperature .    in the presence of the three - body constraint ,",
    "the ground state is always superfluid , but for strong interactions @xmath318 the system becomes fully polarized for fixed total density @xmath138 .",
    "it is remarkable that according to our calculations the system stays fully polarized in a range of low temperatures . for high temperatures a transition to the non - superfluid @xmath1 fermi liquid phase",
    "the critical temperature has a cusp precisely at @xmath319 .",
    "this is in contrast to the @xmath12-symmetric case , where a smooth crossover in the critical temperature takes place .",
    "the c - sf phase shows an interesting interplay between superfluid and magnetic properties . except in the special case of half - filling , the c - sf phase _ always _ implies a spontaneous magnetization which leads to domain formation in balanced 3-component mixture .",
