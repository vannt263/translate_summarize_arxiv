    "detection of the optic disc , the fovea , blood vessels and veins are very important for pathological analysis of retinal image @xcite . since severity of diseases depends on location of features of corresponding diseases with respect to those essential features .",
    "also some pathological features occurs in specific areas .",
    "the optic disc ( od ) can be observed as bright part of normal retinal image , and the fovea as the darkest region . in pathological images",
    "sometimes it s very hard to detect the optic disc and the macula region due to abnormalities caused by different diseases . in most of the recent works on detection accuracy of the optic disc and the macula region in pathological images",
    "is very low , no proper validation of detection region is presented .",

    "it is not possible to give a complete analysis of these works .",
    "a few works were selected for discussing .",
    "@xcite have used line operator to detect circular brightness structure of the optic disc .",
    "their method failed to address large illuminance variation effect with neighbouring regions and limited to clear circular brightness structure .",
    "matched filter based method was proposed by abdel et al .",
    "@xcite , they first preprocesses the images by illumination normalization and histogram equalization .",
    "their algorithm performance depends on the vessel segmentation . and will be effected by adverse illuminance variation .",
    "using retinal vessel direction informtion foracchia et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a geometrical parametric model for the optic disc detection .",
    "the algorithm need vessel segmented images and hence vessel segmentation performance effect its results .",
    "a probability map based localization of the optic disc is presented by budai et al .",
    "@xcite , they have constructed two probability map .",
    "one is brightness based from the brightness of image and other is vessel segmentation based . and combination of these two map was used to locate the optic disc . and this method failed to address the problems of illuminance variation and difficulty involves in pathological images",
    ". a model based approach was used by li et al .",
    "@xcite to detect the optic disc , the macula and exudates . principal component based method was used to locate the optic disc and active shape based method for shape detection of the optic disc and the fovea .    in this work , two new novel method for detection of retinal features is developed .",
    "the optic disc detection is based on saliency map that can capture significant variation of local structure .",
    "once the potential probable location of the optic disc detected , a probabilistic latent semantic analysis based unsupervised method was used to validate whether the region is the optic disc or not , this is based on specific vasculature structure in that region .",
    "this method gives us 100 % accuracy in optic disc detection in different challenging images with pathological symptoms .",

    "the macula region detection by using the information of the optic disc location and the main courses of blood vessels is described in section ( c ) .",
    "this method comprises of mainly two parts . in the first stage detection and validation of the optic disc",
    "is performed , while the fovea detection is dependent on od detection .",
    "a complete overview of the method used in this work is explained in the fig .",
    "2 .",
    "the optic disc is one of the most important anatomical structures of retina .",
    "the optic disc is also known as the blind spot , because there are no light sensitive rods or cones to respond to a light stimulus .",
    "the retinal arteries and veins emerge from the left of the optic disc .",
    "its central white depression called the physiologic cup and horizontal diameter of it should not exceed 1/2 that of entire disc , otherwise it s a sign of pathologic optic disc cupping reasons behind glaucoma . for detection of optic disc",
    "a saliency region detection algorithm @xcite was used to identify salient region of the image , based on image local structure variation . for",
    "this first image will be convert to cie lab colour space , where luminance value from @xmath0 channel of image and colour value from @xmath1 and @xmath2 channel can be seperated .",
    "conversion process is described @xcite as follows .",

    "saliency is computed on the basis of variation of local contrast of a image patch with respect to neighbourhood .",
    "even if the colour vaiation is low but with strong structural variation sm can capture od .",
    "this process is repeated at different scales for getting better accuracy in constructing the map and keeping finer details .",

    "@xmath20 in the final map @xmath21 , due to presence of different pathological symptoms in retinal images , other features along with optic disc also got detected .",
    "to get final location of optic disc a validation method will be applied .",
    "final saliency map may have different regions , optic disc or non - optic disc .",
    "to validate whether a region is optic disc we have used a unsupervised probabilistic latent semantic analysis classification algorithm .",
    "the optic disc structures consist of a complex pattern of vessels originate from it , no other part of retina has this structures , this concept have been exploited for classification and this method is independent of luminance of optic disc region .",
    "even if due to some pathological region luminance is depreciated our method still can accurately detect the optic disc .",
    "the specific vasculature structure may be defected due to several pathological problems , to address this problem , the part based classification model was exploited .",
    "our model comprised six classes , five classes for the optic disc and its parts and the sixth class is other retinal features for differentiation . the optic disc is divided into four parts as shown in fig .",
    "4 . this formulation efficiently detect the optic disc even if its structure is defected .",
    "in the testing phase around each regions multiples window shifted to right , left , top and bottom was chosen .",
    "variable window sizes as shown in fig . 3 and window pixels value will be that of original image at those pixels location . below stages",
    "involves in designing the classifier have been discussed . since image is a very high dimensional data , pre - process it to reduce its dimensionality by using visual codebook formation method .",
    "each image will be represented as a bag of visual words . by using histogram of words concept",
    ", each image will be converted to a document with previously designed vocabulary .      for extracting meaningful edges information from images",

    "this algorithm generate similar codes for similar descriptors by sharing bases .",
    "locality also leads to sparsity .",
