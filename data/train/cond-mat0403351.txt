    "the study of electronic devices at the nanoscale is of paramount importance both from the scientific and the technological point of view .",
    "one important aspect is related to spin polarized electronic transport in magnetic materials , a field usually known as spintronics @xcite .",
    "this has been subject of intense study in recent years , @xcite since the discovery of the giant magnetoresistance effect ( gmr ) in magnetic multilayers .",
    "@xcite gmr is the drastic change of the electrical resistance of a magnetic multilayer when a magnetic field is applied .",
    "the effect of the field is to align ferromagnetically the magnetization vectors of adjacent magnetic layers , which otherwise are oriented antiparallel to each other .",
    "the parallel state has a lower resistance than the antiparallel and this produces the magnetoresistance .",
    "gmr has already led to the construction of the present generation of magnetic data storage devices . however , in order to reach storage densities of the order of terabit / in@xmath2 a substantial downscaling of the read / write devices is needed . one possible avenue to this target is given by magnetic point contacts ( mpc s ) , where the lateral size of the typical contacts approaches the atomic scale .",
    "recent experiments have shown that nanoscaled magnetic point contacts may present huge magnetoresistance @xcite reaching up a few hundred thousand percent .",
    "@xcite this result alone can be seen as a major leap toward nanoscopic magnetic memory read / write devices .",
    "in addition , it is important to report that electro - deposited nickel point contacts present highly asymmetric @xmath0-@xmath1 characteristics typical of a diode - like behaviour .",
    "@xcite a complete explanation of both these effects is still lacking .    to date there is a large debate around the origin of the large magnetoresistance effects in mpc s . on the one hand , it has been argued that magnetic field - induced mechanical effects can produce a large gmr .",
    "in fact , either magnetostriction , dipole - dipole interactions between the apexes@xcite and magnetically induced stress relief@xcite may have the effect of compressing the nanocontact once a magnetic field is applied .",
    "this enlarges the cross section of the mpc and consequently the resistance of the junction decreases . on the other hand , there are also strong indications that mechanical effects alone are not able to account for whole magnetoresistance .",
    "specifically garca _ et .",
    "al . _ have shown that the behaviour of mpc s does not comply with mechanical changes , in particular with magnetostriction effects .",
    "@xcite    one important step toward the understanding of the magnetoresistance effect in point contacts comes from the work of bruno.@xcite he has shown that if the magnetic moments on the apexes of the constriction are not aligned parallel to each other , then a domain wall ( dw ) will be formed inside the constricted region .",
    "the main features of this dw are quite different from those of the well know bloch @xcite and nel @xcite walls .",
    "in particular , the crucial point is that the length of the dw is predicted to be as long as the diameter of the constriction .",
    "this result suggests that the dw trapped in an atomic scale mpc may be very sharp , only a few atomic planes long . at this",
    "length scales a dw produces a rather strong spin - dependent scattering potential and large magneto - induced effects are somehow expected . in this context",
    "it is important to report that such an extreme confinement has been already achieved by contacting two magnetic grains with different orientation . @xcite    since bruno s seminal idea a number of theoretical works on transport through magnetic domain walls have been presented .",
    "@xcite these consider equilibrium transport in the spirit of the landauer - bttiker formalism ; @xcite current induced effects such as charging of the point contact and , quite possibly , movement of the domain wall have not been taken into consideration .",
    "however in low dimensional systems such as these even small biases might cause charge accumulation inside the mpc , changing its transport properties.@xcite    in this work we investigate whether the transport properties of mpcs , in particular the magnetoresistance effect and the asymmetry in the @xmath0-@xmath1 curves , can arise from electronic effects only .",
    "we model the magnetoresistance in mpc using the typical spin - valve scheme : we assume that in the absence of a magnetic field , the magnetization vectors of the two leads are aligned opposite to each other ( antiparallel state ) .",
    "therefore in the zero field situation a sharp dw is formed inside the mpc .",
    "then , when a magnetic field is applied , the magnetic moments of the leads align parallel to each other and the wall is eliminated ( parallel state ) . in this configuration",
    "the resistance is reduced giving rise to a gmr - like effect .",
    "our task is to calculate the @xmath0-@xmath1 curves of both the parallel and antiparallel states , assuming a simple but reasonable electronic structure for the material forming the mpc and considering charging effects .",
    "we also investigate the effects of the position of the dw inside the constriction .",
    "when the dw is positioned in the centre of the constriction , we expect symmetric @xmath0-@xmath1 curves , since no asymmetry is present in the mpcs .",
    "however , if the position of the wall is shifted from the midpoint , and charging effects are present , we expect the appearance of asymmetric @xmath0-@xmath1 curves .",
    "it is noteworthy to mention that a linear response landauer - bttiker approach to transport can not account for charging effects , and therefore can not describe asymmetric @xmath0-@xmath1 characteristics .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next sections",
    "we introduce our self - consistent technique based on the non - equilibrium green s function formalism @xcite with tight - binding hamiltonians.@xcite then we will use our method to study the effects due to the existence of a domain wall on the electronic transport of mpc s .",
    "in order to describe the transport properties of mpc s , including charging effects , we use the non - equilibrium green s function approach based on the keldysh formalism.@xcite we start by dividing an open system into three distinct regions : two semi - infinite electrodes and a central scattering region where the mpc is located . here",
    "the leads act as charge reservoirs , therefore they set the temperature and electronic distribution of the junction in the steady state . in principle calculating the electronic structure of such a system would involve the solution of a quantum mechanical problem for a non - periodic open system , which consist of an infinite number of degrees of freedom . however , there are two reasons that allow us to focus only on the central scattering region .",
    "firstly , we note that most of the potential drop occurs at the nanoconstriction .",
    "this observation underpins the assumption that the relevant modification of the electronic structure due to the presence of a bias will occur to those degrees of freedom corresponding to the central region .",
    "secondly we assume that the rearrangement of the electronic structure in the central region does not change the electronic structure of the electrodes . note that this is a well sustained approximation for good metals where the screening length is very short and the relaxation of the charge density occurs within a few atomic planes . under this condition",
    "their dynamics can be neglected with the exception of a rigid shift of the chemical potential due to the bias .",
    "therefore we reduce our problem to that of calculating the green s function of the central scattering region .    using an orthogonal tight - binding model we construct the retarded green s operator of the scattering region in the presence of the leads as follows@xcite @xmath3^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the hamiltonian of the scattering region and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the leads self - energies .",
    "these are energy dependent potentials added to the hamiltonian to account for the interaction with both the left and the right lead .",
    "the self - energies are matrices of the same dimension of @xmath4 and of the form @xmath7 and @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the surface green s functions for the left and right leads respectively and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) is the coupling matrix between the scattering region and the left ( right ) lead .",
    "note that @xmath13 given by the equation ( [ green ] ) is formally the green s function of the effective hamiltonian @xmath14 for the scattering region in presence of the leads @xmath15 this hamiltonian is non - hermitian since the @xmath16 s are not hermitian , consequently the number of electrons in the scattering region is not conserved .",
    "one of the crucial aspects of the method is computing the surface green s functions @xmath17 .",
    "several ways for calculating the surface green s functions of a semi - infinite system are available in the literature , ranging from recursive methods @xcite to semi - analytical solutions .",
    "@xcite in this work we use the technique presented by sanvito _ et .",
    "_ @xcite that calculates the surface green s function exactly .",
    "the method first constructs the green s function of an infinite system and then derives the surface green s functions @xmath17 by introducing the appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "following this procedure a general semi - analytical expression for the surface green s function is derived .",
    "the benefit of our method is to avoid the typical complications of the recursive methods , preserving information about the individual scattering states in the leads .",
    "@xcite    this formulation of the transport problem can account for finite bias .",
    "as we discussed previously the bias @xmath1 is assumed not to change the electronic structure of the leads , but only to shift all energy levels .",
    "therefore @xmath1 is introduced as a rigid shift of the leads hamiltonian on - site energies @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the identity matrix .",
    "this in turn redefines the leads self - energies in the following way @xmath20    in contrast to the leads , due to the presence of a large potential drop , the effects of a finite bias on the scattering region need to be calculated self consistently .",
    "this is done by noting that @xmath21 is a function of the scattering region single particle charge density only@xcite @xmath22 .",
    "this property gives us a clear prescription for performing a self - consistent calculation .",
    "we first compute the scattering region green s function ( equation ( [ green ] ) ) for @xmath23 , where the hamiltonian @xmath21 is evaluated at a given initial charge density @xmath24 .",
    "then from the green s function @xmath13 we calculate the new charge density @xmath25 , which is then used to construct the new hamiltonian @xmath26 .",
    "this procedure is iterated until reaching self - consistency , that is when @xmath27 .",
    "note that a fundamental requirement is that the final self - consistent density matrix matches exactly that of the leads at the boundaries .",
    "therefore we usually enlarge the scattering region to contain a few atomic planes of the leads ( those where the electronic structure is different from that of the bulk ) .",
    "the exact number of such planes depends on the screening length of the material considered . as a general rule we add as many planes as necessary for the charge density of the more external plane to match exactly that of the infinite leads . in this case",
    "the description of the leads in terms of self - energies is perfectly justified .    within this scheme",
    "the density operator of the scattering region @xmath28 is evaluated from the green s function @xmath13 @xmath29 \\mathbf{g}^\\dagger,\\ ] ] where @xmath30,\\ ] ] and @xmath31 is the fermi distribution function calculated at the chemical potentials of the leads @xmath32 .",
    "in general it can be very clumsy to solve the equation ( [ density ] ) numerically , since the integration has to be performed over the entire real axis .",
    "however , we can both add and subtract the term @xmath33 to the equation ( [ density ] ) rewriting the density operator as @xmath34 where now @xmath35 f\\left(\\varepsilon-\\mu_\\mathrm{l}\\right ) ,   \\label{d_equil}\\ ] ] @xmath36.\\ ] ]    we can interpret @xmath37 as the density matrix at equilibrium , _ i.e. _ the one calculated when both the reservoirs have the same chemical potential @xmath38 , and @xmath39 as the out of equilibrium charge density obtained when a potential bias @xmath1 is applied across the device .",
    "the separation of @xmath28 into @xmath37 and @xmath39 has some important numerical advantages .",
    "firstly @xmath39 is bounded by the difference between the fermi functions @xmath40 and therefore one needs to perform the integration only in the energy range between the two chemical potentials . secondly , since the green s function @xmath13 is analytical , @xmath37 can be integrated in the complex plane using a standard contour integral technique .",
    "@xcite in this way we have reduced an unbounded integral over the real energy axis to a bounded one over the real axis plus a well behaving unbounded integral in the complex plane .",
    "in addition , the lower limit of the contour integral is set by the lowest between the bottom of the conduction band of the leads and the deepest of the energy levels of the scattering region .",
    "once self - consistency has been achieved and both the charge density and the potential have been calculated , we can finally evaluate the current through the device @xmath41    the term @xmath42 is the energy - dependent total transmission probability @xmath43@xcite note that the total current is nothing but @xmath44 times the energy - dependent total transmission coefficient integrated over the bias window .",
    "this latter depends not only on the electron energy but also over the bias applied @xmath1 , since the potential across the device is bias - dependent . however",
    ", this does not mean that the electrons exchange energy while passing through the device .",
    "on the contrary the transport is still phase - coherent .",
    "the current is carried by electrons crossing the device with probability @xmath45 , leaving an occupied state of the lead with the higher chemical potential and filling an empty state at the same energy in the other lead . at low bias ( @xmath46 ) and temperature",
    "( @xmath47 ) , the equation ( [ current ] ) reduces to the well - known linear response landauer - bttiker formula.@xcite",
    "the theoretical approach to transport described in the previous section is general and can be applied to a number of different systems and model hamiltonians .",
    "figure [ drawing ] shows a sketch of the point contact used in the present calculations .",
    "our structure consists of two semi - infinite rods representing the leads connected through a constricted region containing four atomic planes with a square four - atom cross section .",
    "this models a nickel nanowire connected to two current / voltage electrodes .",
    "each atomic site is described by a spin - dependent two - orbital tight - binding model .",
    "one orbital forms a broad band and represents the @xmath48 orbitals while the other forms a narrow band and represents the @xmath49 orbitals .",
    "spin degeneracy is lifted on the @xmath49 states by adding a spin - dependent contribution to the on - site energy .",
    "the spin @xmath50 on - site energy for the @xmath51-th orbital at each site ( @xmath51 labels both the position @xmath52 and the orbital @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) is given by @xmath55 the first term , @xmath56 is the spin independent band centre . the second term , which is not zero only for the @xmath49 orbitals is a stoner - like term with @xmath57 the exchange integral , @xmath58 and @xmath59 the magnetic moment at each site .",
    "this latter is given by the difference in the @xmath49 orbital occupation between majority and minority spins .",
    "finally , the last term is introduced to ensure charge neutrality .",
    "@xcite it is proportional to the difference between the self - consistent atomic charge density @xmath60 and that at equilibrium @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath62 is calculated self - consistently from the non - equilibrium density matrix @xmath28 ( equation ( [ dm ] ) ) .",
    "the total number of electrons and the orbital occupation are respectively given by @xmath63\\ ] ] and @xmath64\\:,\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the projector over the state @xmath66 .",
    "finally here we consider only first nearest neighbour coupling with elements @xmath67 , @xmath68 and an hybridization term @xmath69 .            before turning our attention to the non - equilibrium problem , we must set the parameters of the calculation , _ i. e. _ we must determine some reasonable values for @xmath56 , @xmath70 , @xmath57 and @xmath71 . in particular , the leads depicted in figure [ drawing ] should describe the bulk properties of a strong ferromagnet ( a ferromagnet where the majority spin band is completely occupied ) . to this purpose we performed self - consistent calculations of the electronic structure of a 3@xmath723 infinite rod ( representing the leads ) .",
    "we assume an atomic occupation of three electrons per atom ( two electrons in the @xmath48 orbitals and one electron in the @xmath49 orbital ) , and we fix @xmath67 and @xmath68 in order to reproduce the correct bandwidth of the @xmath48 and @xmath49 band of ni respectively .",
    "@xcite then we set @xmath57 , @xmath69 and @xmath71 to give respectively the stoner instability , the charge transfer from the @xmath49 to the @xmath48 band , and the local charge neutrality . a good description of a strong ferromagnet is given by the following choice of parameters : @xmath73  ev , @xmath74  ev , @xmath75  ev , @xmath76  ev , @xmath77  ev , @xmath78  ev and @xmath79  ev .",
    "figure [ dos ] shows the dos resulting from our calculations , where one can clearly see a completely filled @xmath49 band for majority spin and an half - filled @xmath49 band for the minority .",
    "we are now ready to calculate the @xmath0-@xmath1 curve of the nanocontact . in our calculations",
    ", we considered two possible configurations depending on whether the magnetizations in each of the leads are aligned parallel or anti - parallel with respect to each other . in the latter case",
    ", a domain wall will appear in the middle of the constriction with characteristic length scales comparable to the length of the nanowire .",
    "in addition , we study the effect of the position of the dw on the @xmath0-@xmath1 characteristics of the mpc . in all cases presented here we consider collinear spins .",
    "this is justified by a recent calculation from imamura _ et .",
    "@xcite who have used a heisenberg model in a mean field approximation to show that , in the case of a domain wall pinned in a constriction , there is no spin precession and minority and majority bands can be treated separately .",
    "as mentioned previously we model a point contact following the sketch of figure [ drawing ] , where we consider a simple cubic lattice of nickel atoms with the mpc composed by a two - atom - wide four - atom - long chain connected to two semi - infinite rods representing the current / voltage electrodes .",
    "we start by considering the situation where no magnetic field is applied to the mpc . in this case",
    "we assume that a dw forms inside the constriction .",
    "however it is worth noting that the position of the dw is not _ a priori _ determined , since in general it is given by pinning centers in the junction .",
    "these are not present in our calculations and therefore we have considered two possibilities : 1 ) the dw is situated half way across the device ( symmetrical case ) , and 2 ) the dw is situated between the third and fourth transversal plane ( asymmetrical case ) . it important to stress that in both the situations the domain wall is abrupt and that the direction of the magnetization changes by 180@xmath80 across the bloch wall .",
    "-@xmath1 characteristic for the asymmetric domain wall.,width=264 ]    figure [ asymmetric ] shows our results for all these cases . as a matter of notation , in all the @xmath0-@xmath1 curves presented hereafter we define positive bias when the current flows from the left hand - side to the right hand - side ( from plane one to four ) and we use the left - hand side lead to set the spin direction . in figure [ asymmetric ]",
    "the dashed curve shows our result for a symmetric dw and the dotted line the asymmetric .",
    "we can clearly see that an asymmetric @xmath0-@xmath1 curve appears when the domain wall is asymmetrically placed with respect to the junction .",
    "ev).,title=\"fig:\",width=283 ]  ev).,title=\"fig:\",width=283 ]  ev).,title=\"fig:\",width=283 ]    before discussing the reason for this asymmetry we consider the case when a magnetic field strong enough to align the magnetic moment of the leads is applied .",
    "we simulate this situation by setting the magnetization of the leads to be parallel to each other .",
    "the self consistent solution now does not present any bloch wall and the corresponding @xmath0-@xmath1 characteristic is also shown in figure [ asymmetric ] ( solid line ) . from the picture",
    "it is clear that the current for the parallel configuration is larger than that of both the antiparallel ones at any bias .",
    "this of course means that the point contact presents positive magnetoresistance at any bias .",
    "it is also worth noting that such a magnetoresistance increases as the bias increases , in particular for the case in which the dw is asymmetrically placed in the junction .",
    "this suggests that a large gmr entirely due to the electronic properties of the point contact can be obtained , although for a fully quantitative estimation a more realistic description of the electronic structure and the structural conformation of the point contact is needed .",
    "let us now turn our attention to the asymmetry properties of the @xmath0-@xmath1 curves . in order to achieve a qualitative understanding of the underling physics",
    "it is useful to calculate the transmission coefficients as a function of the energy for different biases and for the three situations studied ( parallel , antiparallel symmetry and antiparallel asymmetric ) .",
    "these are presented in figure [ transm ] .",
    "since the current is essentially given by the energy integral of the transmission coefficient over the bias window ( see the equation ( [ current ] ) ) , from the picture one can establish the relative contribution of the different spin currents to the total current for a given bias .",
    "for the parallel case ( figure [ transm]a and [ transm]b ) the current has contributions from both the spin directions , although the majority spins contribute to the transmission coefficient below the fermi level and the minority contribute above .",
    "borrowing the notation from molecular transport theory @xcite we can say that the majority spin conductance is through the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) , while the minority is through the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) .",
    "the situation changes drastically when we look at the antiparallel alignment .",
    "consider first the symmetric dw case .",
    "from the figures [ transm]c and [ transm]d one can see that the conductance around @xmath81 is dominated by majority spins for positive bias and by minority spins for negative bias .",
    "we can understand this behaviour by looking at the cartoon of figure [ cartoon ] .    here",
    "we schematically model our magnetic point contact as a magnetic molecule .",
    "when the magnetization of the two leads are aligned parallel to each other ( and to the molecule ) the molecule presents a majority spin homo and a minority spin lumo state ( figure [ cartoon]a ) .",
    "both these states extend through the whole molecule and can give rise to resonant transport .",
    "in contrast , in the antiparallel case the dw formed inside the molecule splits the homo and lumo states .",
    "in fact , since the transmission through the dw is small and the coupling with the leads strong , we can now model our system as two molecules strongly attached respectively to the left and the right lead , but weakly coupled to each other .",
    "this gives rise to the level scheme presented in figure [ cartoon]b , which is strictly valid only in the case the dw resistance is infinite . within this scheme the left hand - side part of the pc couples strongly with the left lead therefore presenting a majority spin homo and a minority spin lumo",
    "the situation is opposite on the right hand - side since the magnetization of the right lead is rotated .",
    "recalling the fact that we do not consider the possibility of spin mixing , this configuration presents a large resistance since there are no resonant states with the same spin extending through the entire point contact .",
    "if we now apply a bias there will be level shifting .",
    "this aligns the majority spins homo on the left with the lumo on the right for positive bias ( figure [ cartoon]c ) and the minority lumo on the left with the homo on the right for negative bias ( figure [ cartoon]d ) .",
    "therefore this mechanism leads to majority spin conductance for positive bias and minority spin conductance for negative .    from this simple scheme it is also easy to explain the symmetry properties of the @xmath0-@xmath1 curves .",
    "these are mainly given by the charging properties of the whole structure .",
    "for positive bias and symmetric dw charge is accumulated in the first two atomics planes to the left of the dw and it is depleted in the two atomic planes to the right .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure [ occup_sym ] where we present the net charge on each atomic plane as a function of bias voltage . according to the equation ( [ escat ] )",
    "charge accumulation ( depletion ) moves the molecular levels toward higher ( lower ) energies . in the case of a symmetric dw the molecular states to the left and to the right of the bloch wall charge in a symmetric way with respect to the bias direction",
    "this means that the level alignment responsible for the large current will occur for the same bias difference independently from the bias polarity .",
    "in contrast , when the dw is between the third and the fourth plane , more charge can be accumulated ( depleted ) to the left of the dw with respect to the right ( see figure [ occup_asym ] ) , since more states ( atomic planes ) are available .",
    "in other words the energy levels do not shift at the same rate for positive and negative bias .",
    "this means that the alignment of the energy level now depends on the bias polarity , leading to an asymmetric @xmath0-@xmath1 curve .",
    "note that the mechanism for asymmetry proposed here does not require different coupling between the point contact and the two leads , but only a non - symmetric position of the dw within the point contact .",
    "in summary , we have calculated the @xmath0-@xmath1 curve for a model magnetic point contact , and demonstrated that large magnetoresistance can be obtained solely from its electronic properties .",
    "this is the result of strong scattering through a domain wall pinned inside the contact .",
    "we have also investigated the rle of the position of the dw inside the junction and its effect on the @xmath0-@xmath1 curves .",
    "our main result is that largely asymmetric @xmath0-@xmath1 curves can be found when the dw is asymmetrically placed inside the point contact , although the whole structure does not present any structural asymmetry .",
    "we have interpreted this result in terms of the charging properties of the junction and of spin - dependent homo / lumo alignment .",
    "although our results are semi - quantitative and a more accurate description of the electronic structure of the materials forming the point contact is needed , we believe that large asymmetry of the @xmath0-@xmath1 curve and gmr are a common feature of atomic scale magnetic point contacts .",
