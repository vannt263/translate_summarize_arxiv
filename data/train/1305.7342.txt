    "recent observations of the bottom meson decays @xmath21 by belle @xcite and babar @xcite seem to reveal an interesting feature : the observed @xmath9 dependence of the differential branching fraction , @xmath22 , seems to have a dip at a small value of @xmath9 ( @xmath23 ) , i.e. @xmath24 gev@xmath25 . on the other hand , the lhcb experiments have reported a dip in @xmath26 @xcite and no dip in @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "as we emphasize in the end of the final section , these experimental results are very suggestive to us .",
    "of course , we can not deduce such the existence of a dip only from the current @xmath0 decay data , because the amount of data is still not sufficient .",
    "besides , we can not see such a dip in the data of cdf @xcite . nevertheless , in this paper , we dare to investigate a possibility that a dip in @xmath28 is true , because it means that there is a new contribution to the decays @xmath21 in addition to the conventional electroweak penguin decay @xcite , @xmath29 where @xmath30 and , for simplicity , we have dropped contribution from @xmath31 . in the conventional analysis @xcite",
    ", they use effective hamiltonian to perform this transition ( see for a review @xcite ) .",
    "although we have certainly @xmath9 dependence in their hamiltonian , we omit such term due to smallness of its wilson coefficient . as a result , the differential branching fraction does not have the @xmath9 pole and it can not also explain the dip at small @xmath9 region .",
    "on the other hand , in the recent analysis @xcite-@xcite , they have promoted to improve the analysis at the low recoil region , that is the large @xmath32 of the order of the @xmath16-quark mass .    actually , recent calculations about rare b meson decay channels seem to become high accuracy by developments of these studies . in the research of flavor physics , however , it is essential to pay attention to flavor - dependent phenomena .",
    "any suggestions for flavor physics will not be obtained from flavor - blind phenomena .",
    "unfortunately , recent development of the high energy physics and qcd seems to weaken characteristics of the quark flavors .",
    "for example , recall that , during four years after discovery of the charmed mesons ( 1975 ) , people had believed that lifetimes of the charmed mesons @xmath33 and @xmath34 are @xmath35 speculated by qcd , until a possibility of @xmath36 is pointed out in 1979 @xcite and , until the observation of @xmath37 at spear is , in fact , reported @xcite .",
    "again , let us direct our attention to @xmath38 decays",
    ". there must be some differences between @xmath39 and @xmath40 , as far as @xmath41 emission is done by photon , because of the charge difference between @xmath42 and @xmath43 in @xmath44 .",
    "nevertheless , most peoples have investigated only quantities without distinction between @xmath13 and @xmath12 , because effects from the spectator quark @xmath3 seems to be negligibly small . in this paper",
    ", we would like again to pay attention to valence quarks in hadrons without qcd corrections , and thereby , we would like to find some differences among the quark flavors .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is not to discuss the absolute value of @xmath45 quantitatively , but to discuss the shape of @xmath22 qualitatively .",
    "we will speculate that if the  observed \" dip in the @xmath9 distribution of @xmath21 is true , a contribution due to photon emission from the  spectator \" quark in the @xmath0 meson @xmath5 .",
    "in the conventional model , photon which produces a lepton pair is emitted via the effective interaction ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) , @xmath46 .",
    "however , in the present paper , we discuss a case in which such photon is emitted from the  spectator \" quark @xmath47 as well as the @xmath48 transition happens in the opposite side of the @xmath47 .",
    "nevertheless , we will use the terminology  spectator \" quark for @xmath47 in the @xmath0 meson @xmath5 for convenience . ]",
    "is important .",
    "the first analysis of the  spectator \" quark contribution to @xmath21 has been done by beneke , feldmann and seidel @xcite .",
    "( for a recent analysis , for example , see ref.@xcite and the references therein . )",
    "if contribution from the spectator quark to the @xmath21 is sizable , the @xmath9 dependence of @xmath49 will be considerably different between @xmath12 and @xmath13 in so far as there is a dynamics which can distinguish the spectator quarks .",
    "our interest is in this difference between @xmath12 and @xmath13 decays .",
    "( for isospin asymmetries , for example , see @xcite and @xcite . )",
    "in order to see the difference clearly , for the moment , we dare to drop form factor effects . for recent study of the form factor effects , for example ,",
    "see ref.@xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is not to give a good fitting to the observed branching ratios and the differential branching ratios .",
    "it is to make a comparison between photon emission from the spectator quark and that from @xmath48 transition qualitatively .",
    "usually , the emission of photon from quarks is considered as that from the transition @xmath48 , eq .",
    "( [ eq:1.1 ] ) , so that the decay amplitude has no @xmath9 pole .",
    "the interaction gives a decay amplitude of @xmath21 @xmath50 \\ , , \\label{eq:1.3 } \\ ] ] where @xmath51 is a form factor in the meson currents for the effective quark interaction ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) .",
    "however , if the photon can be emitted from the `` spectator '' quark line which can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , the decay amplitude will have a factor @xmath52 differently from the effective interaction ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) . in this paper",
    ", we consider a possibility that photon can be emitted from the `` spectator '' quark line , @xmath53 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "( of course , we will take other three diagrams similar to fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] into consideration as discussed later . )",
    "the contribution ( [ eq:1.3 ] ) is not entire one in the current estimates of the @xmath54 decays .",
    "there are actually many other contributions which are not included into this work .",
    "for instance , the most well known contribution is so - called weak annihilation @xcite",
    ". we will use ( [ eq:1.3 ] ) as the typical one of the conventional estimates . in our calculations , we do not apply any qcd corrections , _ e.g. _ form factor effects , so that we will also neglect such corrections in the conventional contributions , too .",
    "although such a treatment looks like an oversimplified one , it is useful to see contributions from valence quarks individually .",
    "for example , we illustrate @xmath9 dependence in @xmath55 later in figs .",
    "[ fig:6 ] and [ fig:8 ] by introducing a parameter @xmath56 .",
    "since we illustrate the standard model contribution by a curve with @xmath57 , we can easily see corrected curves with @xmath58 by imaging the standard model contribution correctly for the curve with @xmath57 . of course",
    ", we do not consider that such neglected corrections are unnecessary .",
    "those considerations will become important in quantitative fitting to the data .",
    "however , in this paper , we give only qualitative study .",
    "due to photon emission from spectator quark .",
    ", width=302 ]    the purpose of the present paper is to demonstrate sizable contribution of photon emission from the spectator quark rather than to propose a new mechanism of the @xmath16-@xmath17 transition . in the present model ,",
    "the photon emission from the spectator quark @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) , @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) is independent of the @xmath16-@xmath17 transition mechanism , and the characteristic results are due to a straightforward estimate of the quark propagator which can not be incorporated into the factorization method .",
    "therefore , in the present paper , to specify the origin of the @xmath16-@xmath17 transition is not essential . at present ,",
    "the most likely candidate of such a @xmath16-@xmath17 transition will be the so - called gluon - penguin contribution without discrimination of spectator quarks .",
    "however , it is also interesting to consider another possibility , an exchange of a family gauge boson @xmath61 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] instead of the gluon penguin . here",
    "@xmath61 is a family gauge boson which changes family number from  2 \" to  3 \"",
    ". we will give a brief review of the family gauge boson model @xcite in the next section ( and also [ app : a ] ) .",
    "the results for @xmath12 and @xmath13 will be highly dependent as whether we adopt family gauge boson model or gluon penguin model .    in sec .  3",
    ", we discuss our assumptions in the effective valence quark model . in sec .  4 , we give a form factor - like function @xmath62 which gives contribution of photon emission from quarks .",
    "( however , as we emphasize in sec .",
    "3 , the factor @xmath62 is not the so - called  form factor \" . in the present prescription , we do not introduce any form factor .",

    ", we put an assumption in order to calculate the function @xmath62 simply .",

    "( [ eq:1.3 ] ) and we do not take qcd corrections into consideration in this our naive results . finally , sec .",
    "7 is devoted to the concluding remarks .",
    "our results are somewhat different from the conventional one .",
    "the reason of the difference is in that in the present calculation we straightforwardly calculate effects of the quark propagator between the gauge - boson mediated vertex and the emitted photon vertex .",
    "we will emphasize the meaning of our prescription .",
    "as we stated in sec .  1 , we demonstrate spectator effects based on a family gauge boson model . as we show in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , the energy - momentum due to @xmath16-@xmath17 transition is transmitted to the spectator quark @xmath59 mediated by a family gauge boson @xmath61 .",
    "the family gauge boson model @xcite has somewhat peculiar characteristics differently from conventional family gauge boson models .",
    "the model has the following characteristics : ( i ) the family symmetry is u(3 ) [ not su(3 ) ] , so that we have nine family gauge bosons ( not eight those ) .",

    "( iii ) @xmath65-@xmath66 , @xmath34-@xmath67 and @xmath12-@xmath68 mixings are caused only through non - zero quark - family mixing ( @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) .",
    "note that if the u(3 ) family symmetry is broken by @xmath71 and/or @xmath72 of u(3 ) as a conventional family gauge boson , a direct transition @xmath73 will appear , while , in the present model , there are no such scalars .",
    "for example , @xmath74-@xmath75 mixing is only caused through the down - quark mixing @xmath76 . if we suppose @xmath77 ( i.e. @xmath78 ) , the gauge boson contribution to the @xmath74-@xmath75 mixing is suppressed enough by the ckm elements.-@xmath79 mixing is mode with @xmath80 ( @xmath81 is family number ) , while @xmath82 is mode with @xmath83 .",

    "( for more details , see [ app : a ] . )",
    "such a family gauge boson model without a direct mixing @xmath73 was first proposed by sumino @xcite .",
