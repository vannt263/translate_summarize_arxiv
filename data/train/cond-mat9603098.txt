    "due to its simplicity the normal metal single electron double junction ( 1e2j , shown schematically in fig .  [ fig1 ] ) is one of the best  studied systems of single electronics , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "the common theoretical approach uses `` orthodox theory''@xcite to find a master equation for the charge probability of the island between the two junctions .",
    "the stationary solution of this master equation is known analytically.@xcite since the derivation of the equation itself restricts its solution to slow processes on the time scale of @xmath0 the system appears more or less transparent within `` orthodox theory . ''",
    "however , if one applies `` orthodox theory '' to the 1e2j one realizes that the structure of the stationary solution restricts its practical use to both low voltages and temperatures where the energy scale is the coulomb energy @xmath1 .",
    "therefore the investigation of @xmath2level systems , taking into account the most important charge states only , was introduced.@xcite using this method , main features of single electron tunneling ( set ) , such as coulomb blockade or the coulomb staircase , can be understood theoretically .    here",
    "we present an alternative method of solving the master equation that is mainly applicable at either high voltage and negligible temperature or high temperature and small voltage . in these cases",
    "the stationary solution of the master equation simplifies and provides access of the full time ",
    "dependent solution . in this regard",
    "the presented approach is complementary to that of a @xmath2level system .",
    "we use this solution for the calculation of the current and the current noise in a 1e2j for frequencies",
    "@xmath3 .",
    "the physical relevance of our results lies in clarifying the asymptotic behavior of the 1e2j rather than in unveiling new set effects .",
    "in fact , the latter can not be expected in the considered domain .",
    "furthermore , the treatment may be used as an easy  to  handle approximation in specific cases .    in sec .",
    "[ main ] we present the general approach . in secs .",
    "[ ohmic ] and  [ thermal ] this general approach is applied to the case of a high voltage at low temperature ( ohmic limit ) and low voltage but high temperature ( thermal limit ) , respectively .",
    "both stationary mean current through a 1e2j and current noise power spectrum are calculated .",
    "the results are discussed and limiting cases are compared with known results .",
    "let @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the tunneling rates in right and left direction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) across the @xmath6th junction if @xmath7 excess charges reside on the island between the junctions .",
    "then the matrix @xmath8    \\big[\\delta_{y\\,x+1}+\\delta_{y\\,x}\\big]\\\\     & & + \\big[r_2(x)+l_1(x)\\big]\\big[\\delta_{y\\,x}+\\delta_{y\\,x+1}\\big ]    \\big\\ } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] enables to write the `` orthodox '' master equation @xmath9 of @xmath7 excess charges on the island as the @xmath7th component of the vector @xmath10 . due to the underlying tunneling of charges",
    "@xmath7 is integer .",
    "the left and right eigenfunctions are given by @xmath11 with the eigenvalues @xmath12 .",
    "it can be shown@xcite that one of the eigenvalues equals zero ( let it be @xmath13 ) .",
    "the corresponding eigenfunction @xmath14 describes the stationary solution of the master equation ( [ me ] ) .",
    "it obeys the detailed balance condition @xmath15 left and right eigenfunctions are related through@xcite @xmath16 from eq .",
    "( [ lr ] ) we see that @xmath17 .",
    "the orthogonality relation of the left eigenfunctions reads @xmath18 thus , the eigenfunctions @xmath19 form a set of orthogonal polynomials with the weight function @xmath20 ( `` set polynomials '' ) . as an example , these polynomials are shown in table  [ tab1 ] for a special case . in general",
    ", @xmath19 is a polynomial of order @xmath2 in @xmath7 .",
    "if the stationary solution of the master equation ( [ me ] ) is known , an arbitrary time dependent one follows readily from eqs .",
    "( [ lr ] ) and ( [ ortho ] ) : @xmath21 where the @xmath22 are adjusted to meet the initial probability distribution @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath25 , which determine the time  dependence ,",

    "now we turn to the case of zero temperature .",
    "then the detailed balance property ( [ db ] ) causes the ratio @xmath27 to be a rational function of the bias voltage @xmath28 , and of the dimensionless charges @xmath29 and @xmath7 . whereas @xmath7 describes the integer part of the charge , which is altered during tunneling processes , the parameter @xmath30 expresses the influence of background charges and/or an applied gate voltage . in the following",
    "we will make use of the additional dimensionless parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "if @xmath34 is integer and obeys @xmath35 for an arbitrary other integer @xmath36 , the ratio @xmath27 can be written as @xmath37 with @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",

    "the `` binomial points '' of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] correspond to voltages where the @xmath52@xmath45 characteristic of the 1e2j touches the asymptotic line . for the symmetric 1e2j with @xmath53 this happens for @xmath54 with integer @xmath36 .",
    "next we present our result of the current noise of a 1e2j .",
    "the method of calculation has been described in refs .   and  .",
    "it takes advantage of the representation of the conditional probability @xmath55 and the matrix elements of @xmath56 in terms of the eigenfunctions @xmath57 .",
    "after several steps ( see appendix ) we obtain @xmath58 for zero frequency . since a realistic estimation shows that @xmath59 typically , the result ( [ st0 ] ) is valid in a wide range of frequencies , down to the regime where @xmath60noise becomes predominant .",
    "( [ st0 ] ) yields the ordinary shot noise formula in the limit of an extremely asymmetric 1e2j ( @xmath61 or vice versa ) , where the current across both junctions is uncorrelated .",
    "the shot noise is halved for a symmetric 1e2j in agreement with earlier results.@xcite    additional noise suppression in double junctions in dependence on the bias voltage was both theoretically predicted@xcite and experimentally observed.@xcite our result ( [ st0 ] ) does not recover this suppression since the `` binomial points '' are located at bias values where this suppression does not occur .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the results for symmetric and asymmetric 1e2j are shown . for the symmetric system the noise is suppressed .",
    "an additional suppression occurs between the `` binomial points '' in comparison to @xmath62 . for higher bias the use of ( [ st0 ] ) as approximation improves .",
    "this improvement is best for the symmetric 1e2j .",
    "let us now consider the case of dominating temperature @xmath63 .",

    "( [ lambdat0 ] ) .",
    "while our consideration has been exact within orthodox theory so far , the treatment requires several approximations from now on .",
    "since many states are significantly occupied , the above charge state sums can be replaced by integrals @xmath68 .",

    "even if this expansion yields positive powers in @xmath7 , which are integrated later on , its use is justified by @xmath20 of ( [ phi0th ] ) , which decreases very rapidly with increasing @xmath73 . for the stationary current",
    "we find @xmath74 this high temperature result is independent of the double junction s symmetry",

    "this result coincides with the high temperature limit of ref .  , but gives a correction to the known expression as well . in case of symmetric 1e2j ( or more generally : for @xmath78 ) the term @xmath79 in ( [ stth ] ) simplifies to unity and it becomes clear that the nyquist formula yields an upper bound of the noise of a 1e2j",
    "this fact expresses the partial coherence between tunneling events on both junctions . at high temperature ,",
    "however , this coherence get lost .",
    "this behavior does not correspond to the @xmath80formula@xcite @xmath81 using the current @xmath82 through the system and the bias voltage @xmath45 , which predicts elevated noise above @xmath83 .",
    "we want to point out that the @xmath80formula was derived for the single junction ( 1e1j ) and does not allow for coherence effects of both junctions .",
    "we have presented a method allowing access to the time  dependent solution of the master equation that is used in the semiclassical `` orthodox theory '' to describe the behavior of an ultrasmall single electron double junction .",
    "this method is based on general properties of master equations .",
    "we can show that the stationary solution of the master equation is sufficient to determine any time ",
