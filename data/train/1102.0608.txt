    "packings of rods in three dimensions have been extensively studied due to their rich theoretical @xcite and industrial aspects with applications to lyotropic liquid crystals , bio - packings like dna , powders and construction materials @xcite .",
    "this rich behavior is related to the number of degrees of freedom , which gives rise to interesting liquid crystal phases beyond the usual crystal - liquid - gas phases",
    ". however , the existence of intrinsic correlations seems to prohibit any theoretical study so far attempted , except for infinitely thin hard rods in thermal equilibrium , where these correlations vanish as shown by onsager s virial theory @xcite : onsager s second order truncation of the free energy becomes exact in the limit of infinitely thin particles @xcite .    when a suspension of rods settles by gravity , a jammed phase develops where each particle is at mechanical equilibrium and thermal agitation does not play a role .",
    "the present paper is the starting point of a series that will investigate the jammed phases of packings of rods from a statistical mechanical point of view using edwards ensemble theory for jammed granular matter @xcite .",
    "the applicability of the theory to the study of same - size ball packings in two @xcite , three @xcite , and infinite dimensions @xcite and for polydisperse ball packings @xcite motivates the present work . as in onsager s equilibrium theory , rodlike jammed particles of different orientations can be treated as belonging to different species .",
    "thus , the problem of non - spherical monodisperse particles can be mapped to the problem of polydisperse spheres and the framework developed in @xcite for jamming of different size balls can be readily applied to the jamming of hard rods .",
    "this paper is mainly technical and presents an algorithm for the calculation of the voronoi diagram of a set of spherocylinders .",
    "the voronoi volume of a single particle in edwards statistical mechanics ( also called the _ volume function _",
    "@xcite ) is the analogue of the energy associated to a particle in the classical boltzmann statistical mechanics .",
    "we study spherocylinders ( a cylinder of length @xmath0 and diameter @xmath1 capped with two semispheres of radius @xmath2 at both ends ) as a model of hard rods since their voronoi diagram is the same as the one of line segments .",
    "spherocylinders constitute therefore a special case of non - spherical particles which are easier to treat than , for instance , ellipsoids of revolution . however , the general concepts are expected to apply to these more complicated shapes as well .",
    "the limiting aspect ratio @xmath3 is discussed as a generalization of onsager s equilibrium results as well as the spherical limit , @xmath4 , as a generalization of the equilibrium phases of hard spheres .",
    "the following results are relevant for the present study :    _ ( i ) _ onsager s theory for equilibrium thin rods @xcite , @xmath3 , predicts a first order transition between an isotropic phase stable below the freezing point at the volume fraction @xmath5 , and a nematic phase stable above the melting point @xmath6 .    _",
    "( ii ) _ onsager s transition is analogous to the freezing transition of equilibrium hard spheres ( @xmath4 ) @xcite between an isotropic phase stable below @xmath7 and a crystalline phase stable above @xmath8 .    _ ( iii ) _ philipse _ et al .",
    "_ experimentally studied isotropic jammed phases of thin rods @xcite and showed that the volume fraction of the random close packing ( rcp ) as a function of aspect ratio can be fitted as @xmath9 .",
    "this formula is valid for @xmath10 and has been related to excluded volume arguments from onsager @xcite showing that @xmath11 is half the isostatic coordination number of rods , @xmath12 .",
    "when @xmath13 new physics beyond the onsager limit appears as the isostatic limit of spherical particles @xmath14 is approached continuously from @xmath15 @xcite .    _",
    "( iv ) _ jin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite found numerically that jammed hard spheres undergo a first - order phase transition analogous to the equilibrium one .",
    "this scenario has been proposed by radin _",
    "the jammed isotropic phase is stable from random loose packing , rlp , @xmath16 , to rcp , @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the crystal phase is stable from the melting point @xmath18 to fcc , @xmath19 . between melting and freezing a glass - crystal mixture coexists .    _",
    "( v ) _ the application of the edwards ensemble to jammed elongated particles has been treated by mounfield and edwards @xcite .",
    "this approach uses a phenomenological mean - field volume function to describe the microscopic interactions between rods .",
    "the phase behavior predicted by mounfield and edwards is rather simple with no evidence of a discontinuous change in the symmetry of the system , suggesting no phase transition in contrast to onsager s model .",
    "we notice that edwards model , being phenomenological , does not explicitly take into account the steric interaction between rods .    here",
    "we calculate a volume function based on the voronoi volume which accounts for excluded volume effects and orientational interactions , crucial to determine the phase behavior of the system .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to investigate the phases of jammed rods for all aspect ratios .    ,",
    "i.e. , solving for the point where @xmath20 is the same as solving @xmath21.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "for the study of jammed packings , edwards ensemble theory uses the volume as a conserved quantity instead of the energy as in the classical boltzmann statistical mechanics .",
    "the volume associated to each particle is the voronoi volume @xcite defined as all the points of the space that are nearer to the particle than to any other one .",
    "the voronoi boundary between two particles is then the hypersurface that contains all the points that are equidistant to both objects ( fig .",
    "[ rod ] ) .    in geometry",
    ", the calculation of the voronoi diagram of a set of ellipsoids is an old and complicated problem .",
    "the calculation of the voronoi diagram of spherocylinders is simpler than the one for ellipsoids thanks to the following property : the voronoi diagram of a set of spherocylinders of length @xmath0 and radius @xmath2 is equivalent to the one of segments of length @xmath0 , see fig .  [ rod ] .",
    "this equivalence is analogous to the case of equal size spheres .",
    "the voronoi diagram of spheres can be calculated by considering only the set of sphere centers .",
    "such equivalence disappears for instance , when the system consists of spheres of different size .",
    "the radius @xmath2 of the spherocylinders thus does not appear explicitly in the calculation of the voronoi boundary as outlined in the next sections .",
    "however , the radius enters naturally as a limiting condition for the possible configurations of the spherocylinders : for given orientations of the spherocylinders the radius determines a minimal separation such that the volumes are not overlapping .    furthermore , since the voronoi diagram of a set of objects can be deduced from the one between every pair of objects , the problem is reduced to the calculation of the voronoi boundary between two segments .",
    "this voronoi boundary is composed of nine analytical surfaces that have to be evaluated and properly cut to define the continuous and differentiable voronoi boundary .",
    "these surfaces arise as the voronoi boundary due to the following interactions which must be treated separately : a _ point - point _",
    "interaction between any two ends of the segments ( four interactions in total ) , a _ line - point _",
    "interaction between one segment and the end of the other segment ( four interactions ) , and a _ line - line _ interaction between the two segments ( one interaction ) .",
    "the principle of the algorithm is the calculation of these nine surfaces and determine where to cut them to form a continuous and differentiable voronoi boundary .",
    "we use the parameters displayed in fig .  [ param ] .",
    "let us set the origin of the coordinate system at the center of rod @xmath22 , the vector @xmath23 points to the center of the rod @xmath24 .",
    "we are interested in the calculation of the voronoi boundary along a generic direction @xmath25 parameterized by @xmath26 . a point on rod @xmath22",

    "( [ ppsol ] ) we recover the voronoi boundary between two hard spheres as calculated in @xcite : @xmath82",
    "as an example of the algorithm , we apply it to different situations in 2 dimensions , fig .",
    "we consider the rod @xmath22 on the left and the rod @xmath24 on the right .",
    "the top - left panel shows the voronoi boundary in different colors corresponding to different interactions : a point - point interaction at the top of the boundary in red , then a point - line interaction in green , then a line - line interaction in blue , then another point - line interaction in green and so on .",
    "the other panels are analogous .",
    "an important fact we should underline is that the three types of interactions are each composed by four ( for point - point and point - line ) or one ( for line - line ) of the nine surfaces . in dimension",
    "greater than 2 and for general angular configurations , the equation describing the surfaces of the point - line interaction and the line - line interaction are quadratic and the ones of the point - point interaction are linear .",
    "we thus obtain a surface made by a selection of four planes ( due to the point - point interaction ) , four paraboloids of revolution ( point - line ) and one hyperbolic paraboloid ( line - line ) cut and paste together . in the limit @xmath83 , we only keep the hyperbolic paraboloid .",
    "the two dimensional case is special because the line - line equation always gives birth to a line .",
    "we thus obtain a curve made by a selection of five lines and four parabola .",
    "the contribution of the different interactions , noted : @xmath84 for line - line , @xmath85 for point - line and @xmath86 for point - point , naturally changes with the ratio @xmath87 and may lead to different trends in the behaviour of the volume fraction of the packing as a function of the aspect ratio , thus explaining the results of @xcite .",
    "it is evident that for long but finite rods , @xmath84 will intervene much more than point interactions .",
    "thus , @xmath88 and reverse for small rods .",
    "we expect that :    _ ( i ) _ for very large ratio only @xmath84 needs to be considered .    _ ( ii ) _ for large ratio , only @xmath84 and @xmath85 .    _",
    "( iii ) _ for small ratio , only @xmath86 and @xmath85 .    _",
    "( iv ) _ for very small ratio ( slightly deformed spheres ) , only @xmath86 .",
    "these remarks are important to understand the behaviour of the volume fraction as a function of aspect ratio and will be analyzed in future works .",
    "we have shown how to calculate the voronoi boundary between two spherocylinders as a boundary composed by analytical surfaces .",
    "the calculation of the voronoi diagram for a set of spherocylinders is then possible as well as the calculation of the voronoi volume .",
    "the analytical expression for the voronoi boundary is highly simplified in the limit @xmath83 , i.e. , in the onsager limit for finite radius @xmath2 , since only the solution scaling with @xmath65 given by the line - line interaction eq .",
    "( [ ll ] ) needs to be considered ; the surface is then a hyperbolic paraboloid .",
    "the different solutions involving point interactions appear because of the finite extension of the spherocylinders and make the boundary more complicated and not scaling with @xmath65 .",
    "these cases do not appear for infinite extension of the rods , thus onsager limit corresponds to the simplest one .",
    "the next step is to incorporate these expressions in order to calculate the excluded volume and excluded surface for two interacting particles .",
    "the statistical theory for the mean voronoi volume of a rod should be similar to that of ( multi disperse ) spheres @xcite .",
    "thus , the calculation of the probability distribution to find a particle contributing to the voronoi boundary can be performed .",
    "this calculation is analogous to the sphere case and can be performed by integrating over theta functions as in @xcite .",
    "in addition to the integration over the vector @xmath23 one eventually also has to integrate over the possible directions of the rod @xmath24 , @xmath30 .",
    "such a calculation is in progress .",
    "it is interesting to compare the case of rods of finite length to the one of infinite length .",
    "the thickness @xmath1 of the rods does not intervene in any of the formulas of the voronoi boundary in both cases and will intervene only to determine the possible interactions . for spheres ,",
    "we have approximated @xcite the pair correlation function to a step function for the background term and a delta function for the contact term and , on average , this approximation has small influence on the final prediction of the volume fraction of the packing . for rods with infinite length ,",
    "the pair correlation function ( as a function of distance and angles ) is equiprobable for non overlapping configurations as shown in @xcite .",
    "this means that the approximation of @xcite for the background and contact terms may becomes exact for infinite rods . for rods of finite length ,",
    "the correlation function is not equiprobable , and considering the pair correlation function as a step - function becomes an approximation ."
