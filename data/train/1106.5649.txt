    "the rise in occupancy foreseen in the innermost part of the lhcb tracking stations from a higher lhc luminosity , suggests alternative tracking solutions should be explored for the lhcb upgrade  @xcite .",
    "a new tracking option will require a more granular and faster detector , capable of withstanding degradation from the higher radiation rates and must also satisfy the requirement of covering the large area of the innermost region ( i.e. @xmath0  m@xmath1 ) while retaining good spatial resolution with a low material budget .    in this work we present a preliminary study a position tracker made of thick scintillating fibres to replace a large area gas - based tracking detector , made of straw tubes , for the upgrade of the lhcb detector .",
    "the use of scintillating fibres in tracking detectors dates to the last couple of decades  @xcite and improvements to this technology have and continue to occur .",
    "relatively thick scintillating fibres ( in the range of 0.7 to 1  mm ) would be coupled with photo - sensor detectors , most likely either multi - anode photomultiplier tubes ( ma - pmt ) or silicon photomultipliers ( sipm ) .",
    "a quite extensive body of literature  @xcite@xcite , along with the work presented in this report , show that single or double cladding scintillating fibres provide a good light yield , can be resistant to larger radiation doses , while providing ease of operation and construction .",
    "these could then be applied to produce detector with a spacial resolution which would meet lhcb tracking requirements with minimal dead time , so as to avoid pile up effects in the detector .",
    "the geometry of the current outer tracker ( ot ) detector was chosen to limit the occupancy of the hottest regions in the ot detector to below 10% at nominal run conditions at @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the 5  mm cell diameter of the straws was chosen to limit the drift time within the period of three bunch crossings , while maintaining a manageable number of readout channels .",
    "the current ot detector has been designed to withstand irradiation intensities that correspond to an incident rate of 250  khz per cm of wire length at nominal luminosity ( 500 khz / cm@xmath1 )  @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to an integrated charge dose of 2.5  c / cm after 10  run - years of @xmath4  s. the upgraded detector should be able to withstand irradiation levels in the hottest region corresponding at least up to a luminosity of @xmath5 , an increase of one order of magnitude , for 10 years of operation .",
    "the present geometry and design of the straw drift tube chambers limit their effectiveness to @xmath6 with little or no margin for safety , requiring a device with smaller channel size ( or faster response ) and better radiation hardness , given the damage caused by the large doses of radiation expected  @xcite .    in terms of geometry ,",
    "improvements in the occupancy can be gained by using a detector with a smaller profile : a 1  mm scintillating fibre provides a factor of 5 better than the straw drift tube , a 0.7  mm improves by a factor of 7 .",
    "as well , the decay time of a scintillating fibre is typically 2.53.5  ns with a signal delay of 5.33 ns / m  @xcite . assuming a fast photodetector , this feature could be used to discriminate particles belonging to different bunch crossings ( therefore reducing the pile - up in the detector ) .      in gas based devices ,",
    "high radiation doses result in damage to the anode wire , either creating deposits on the wire affecting the electric field around the wire , or causing physical damage to the wire surface , resulting in sparking or other effects that increase noise and reduce gain  @xcite .",
    "these effects are largely difficult to predict and are only discovered after their exposure to radiation _ in situ_. the damage to scintillating fibres due to radiation is well understood and generally progresses linearly with the dose , but the damaging effects can also be undone via hot air curing or other processes  @xcite .",
    "radiation will typically damage the scintillation light producing fluors which have been added to the plastic core ( typically polystyrene ) of the fibre .",
    "damage to the fluors results in a reduction in the intensity of the light produced by an ionizing particle track .",
    "this damage is impossible to recover .",
    "different studies by manufacturers and other groups have resulted in a set of dyes which are resistant to damage .",
    "damage to the plastic core of the fibre , typically degrades the optical transmission properties of the fibres below 500  nm , degrading the bulk attenuation length with increased radiation dose .",
    "damage to the polystyrene dominates the light yield loss and typically reduces the optical transmission at wavelengths below 500  nm by 30 - 60% after 10 mrad ( 6.2@xmath7  mev / g )  @xcite .",
    "however , it is possible to recover large fraction of optical damage to the core via annealing in hot air  @xcite . new types of fast , green , radiation - hard scintillating fibres are available from manufacturers kuraray(scf - mj78(80 ) ) and saint - gobain ( bcf-20 ) , such that the majority of the spectrum is above 500  nm and the radiation damage effects are mitigated .",
    "given the current rate of 500  khz / cm@xmath1 in the hot regions of the outer tracker , the expected rate for an order of magnitude increase in luminosity will be 5  mhz / cm@xmath1 . with a plastic fibre density of @xmath8  1.05  g/@xmath9  @xcite and an energy deposit per unit length for minimum ionizing particles of 2  mev / cm  @xcite",
    ", we can expect 2  mev@xmath10g@xmath11cm@xmath1 in the fibres . at the upgraded luminosity",
    ", the hottest spots can expect a dose rate of 10  mhz@xmath10mev / g . over 10 years ( @xmath12 ) of running , this results in an maximum integrated dose in the fibres of @xmath13  mev / g .",
    "after 10 years of running at the upgrade luminosity , the light yield in the plastic fibres will be a little more than 30 - 60% reduced without annealing , less so if annealed .",
    "radiation damage to the tracker would result in a lower photoelectron yield , degrading the resolution and efficiency , as the analog position resolution is expected to be proportional to the inverse of the square root number of photoelectrons , @xmath14 .",
    "irradiation tests would have to be done to quantify this effect .",
    "a digital tracker resolution would be affected by increased false - negative hits due to the decreased light yield in individual channels .    while the rate of thermal neutrons in the lhcb upgrade is currently unknown , the damage to scintillating fibres has been studied previously in references  @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the thermal neutron damage results in a reduction in the number of photoelectrons and a degraded attenuation length proportional to the integrated flux of neutrons , similar to ionizing radiation damage .",
    "the main contributions to the resolution in a fibre tracker are represented by the pitch of fibres , the poisson nature of the photoelectron distribution , and the efficiency of the photosensor to detect single photons .    in a binary readout mode , where only the channel producing a signal above threshold is recorded ,",
    "the resolution is dominated by the channel width , with a strong contribution from adjacent channel crosstalk .",
    "typically , one can gain from overlapping two channels such that the resolution will be proportional to the overlapped regions , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : fib1 ] .",
    "naively , the resolution goes as the width/@xmath15 such that two 1  mm fibre channels overlapped by 50% would produce a detector position resolution of 0.15  mm , as on the left of fig .",
    "[ fig : fib1 ] .",
    "however , using round fibres , there is very little scintillating material near the edges of each channel and therefore , in case of very thin detector layers , each event can undergo large fluctuation in the amount of traversed active material .",
    "this effect , coupled with the quantum efficiency of the photodetector , light yield attenuation in the fibres and electronics crosstalk , will increase the number of false - negative and false - positive hits degrading the resolution of the detector  @xcite .    ,",
    "but the variation in track length in the scintillating material degrades an energy weighted resolution and will not provide more information than a digital hit based resolution .",
    "track a will provide a good signal in both channels , track b is a single channel hit and track c provides a weak signal in one of the shared hit channels.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    an alternative to the binary method , is to use an analog approach .",
    "if one arranges the fibres such that the position in the channel is proportional to the amplitude of the signal seen in that channel , one can gain additional position information with respect to a binary digital readout .",
    "the ideal case is in panel a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : thickpos ] . practically , this is more easily accomplished with a few square fibres per channel as in fig .",
    "[ fig : thickpos]b ) where the fibre staggering in each channel is smaller than the contribution to the position resolution from the charge resolution",
    ". the analog method will be effective if the photosensor has good single photoelectron resolution such that one can precisely measure the relative amplitude in each channel and correctly determine the position .",
    "an analog readout would require photon counting photosensors along with charge - measuring electronics .",
    "this type of analog readout would produce an excellent resolution with larger diameter fibres , reducing the number of channels needed to cover a given region , but at the cost of increased hardware expenses per channel and overall material budget for a good light yield .",
    "square fibres would also be preferred due to ( @xmath16 ) the lack of gaps between fibres compared to round fibres and ( @xmath17 ) the narrower path - length distribution which produces a consistent signal . however , the square fibres cost approximately double compared to round fibres .",
    "[ fig : thickpos]d is the experimental prototype setup , with only a small amount of fibre overlap .",
    "channels which have shared hits will have very good resolution , but single channel hits will dominate with a degraded resolution .        in both readout cases ,",
    "the poisson nature of the photoelectron statistics requires the light yield to be large so that more than a few photoelectrons will be detected .",
    "this reduces the probability that no photoelectrons being detected to be negligible .",
    "false - negative hits severely degrade the resolution of the digital / binary readout option .",
    "the binary method would also need a significant light yield at the photodetector , > 5 photoelectrons , such that low fluctuations will still exceed the electronics noise of about 12 photoelectrons .",
    "the analog method would require enough light to precisely determine the amplitude of energy deposited in that channel .",
    "fibres typically produce enough light to detect 3 - 5 photoelectrons / mm of track length ( 15 - 25 pe / mev deposited ) with a bialkali readout of 25% quantum efficiency near the charged particle track .",
    "double clad fibres would improve the trapping efficiency by at least 50% .",
    "typical single clad fibres have a trapping efficiency ( due to total internal reflection ) of 3.5% of the produced scintillation light while double clad fibres capture 5.6% ( 7.3% for square )  @xcite",
    ". new super- and ultra - bialkali cathode photodetectors have been produced recently by hamamatsu which have average quantum efficiencies of 30 and 42% , respectively .",
    "a prototype scintillating fibre detector was constructed and tested with cosmic rays at laboratori nazionali di frascati dellinfn ( lnf ) using 60 parallel columns of six kuraray  scsf81sj single clad , 1.00@xmath180.05  mm fibres with a peak emission wavelength of 437  nm ( blue ) .",
    "the fibre columns have a 1.35  mm mean horizontal pitch and 0.74  mm vertical fibre pitch .",
    "the variation in pitch has not been measured yet , but will have some contribution to the position resolution .",
    "the fibres were glued with optical epoxy intermittently along their length , and with the fibres in each channel ganged together and readout with a 64 channel hamamatsu 8500 ( h8500 ) multi - anode photomultiplier tube ( ma - pmt ) .",
    "the test setup , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schem ] , included four layers of muon drift tubes ( mdt ) inter - spaced with the fibre detector for tracking purposes .",
    "the 11 drift tubes were 3  cm in diameter , with a 30  @xmath19 m diameter au - w wire operated at hv=4600 v. a 40:60 ar  isobutane gas mixture in limited streamer regime ensured large amplitude signals and stable operation .",
    "two scintillator paddles in coincidence formed the trigger / gate for the setup , with one paddle placed directly on top of the mdts and one placed 60  cm below the fibre detector , ensuring nearly vertical tracks .",
    "the scintillating fibre tracker is placed between the top three tubes and the bottom eight tubes , as shown in fig .",
