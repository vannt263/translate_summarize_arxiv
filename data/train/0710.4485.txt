    "the dissolution process of star clusters is an old problem in stellar dynamics .",
    "once a star cluster has formed somewhere in a galaxy , it tends to lose mass due to dynamical interactions until it has completely dissolved .",
    "it turned out that the physics behind the dissolution of star clusters is intricate and fascinating for theory .",
    "if a star cluster of finite mass were isolated , in virial equilibrium ( i.e. @xmath2 ) and the velocity distribution given by a maxwellian @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the velocity , the escape velocity and the velocity dispersion , respectively , the fraction of stars which are faster than the rms escape speed were given by @xmath7 .",
    "this simple analytical result was published by ambartsumian ( 1938 ) and two years later , independantly by spitzer ( 1940 ) who named this effect `` evaporation '' . the relevant process which brings stars above the escape speed and lets them evaporate , is two - body relaxation . the time scale of relaxation , which determines the rate of dynamical evolution of a star cluster , yields thus an upper limit to the lifetime of any star cluster .",
    "however , since @xmath8 is so small ( and relaxation time relatively long ) , the evaporation time is much longer than a hubble time for typical globular clusters . following a suggestion of chandrasekhar ( 1942 ) , king ( 1959 ) studied the effect of `` potential escapers '' .",
    "these are stars which have been scattered above the escape energy but which have not yet left the cluster .",
    "these may be scattered back to negative energies within a crossing time and remain bound .",
    "hnon ( 1960 , 1969 ) stressed the importance of few close encounters between stars for the rate of mass loss of star clusters .",
    "the fokker - planck approximation , which is widely used to study the dynamical evolution of star clusters , neglects strong encounters by construction .",
    "nevertheless , close encounters could still be interpreted statistically as a certain discontinuous markov process ( tscharnuter 1971 ) . however , direct @xmath9-body models seem to be ideally suited to study this phenomenon in more detail .",
    "spitzer & shapiro ( 1972 ) estimate that `` close encounters may produce effects perhaps as great as 10 percent of the `` dominant '' distant encounters '' and ignore them .",
    "nature provides an environment for star clusters in which the escape rate is typically strongly enhanced as compared with the slow evaporation rate of isolated star clusters : the tidal field of a galaxy induces saddle - like troughs in the walls of the potential well of a star cluster ( cf .",
    "figure 1 ) .",
    "it therefore lowers the energy threshold in star clusters above which stars can escape from zero to a negative value ( wielen 1972 , 1974 ) .",
    "moreover , if we consider a star cluster in the tidal field of a galaxy as a dynamical system , the tidal field can change the system s dynamics in a dramatical way as compared with an isolated system .    in general , the escape process from star clusters in a tidal field proceeds in two stages : ( 1 ) scattering of stars into the `` escaping phase space '' by two - body encounters and ( 2 ) leakage through openings in the equipotential sufaces around saddle points of the potential .",
    "the `` escaping phase space '' is defined as the subset of phase space , from which escape is possible .",
    "it is well understood that the time scale for a star to complete stage ( 1 ) scales with relaxation time . on the other hand ,",
    "the time scale for a star to complete stage ( 2 ) depends mainly on its energy ( but also on its location in phase space as we will see ) .",
    "when we neglect the effect of two - body relaxation for the consideration of stage ( 2 ) , the motion of a single star in the star cluster is determined between times @xmath10 and @xmath11 only by the smooth gravitational potential in which the star moves .",
    "the potential itself is generated by the other stars in the star cluster disregarding their `` grainyness '' and by the superposed galactic gravitational field , which is due to the matter distribution of the galaxy . within this framework , we will study stage ( 2 ) of the escape process in this paper . in this connection ,",
    "the work of fukushige & heggie ( 2000 ) is of major interest .",
    "their main result is an expression for the time scale of escape for a star in stage ( 2 ) which has just completed stage ( 1 ) .",
    "the dependance of the escape process on two time scales which scale differently with the particle number @xmath9 imposes a severe scaling problem for @xmath9-body simulations .",
    "the scaling problem is of relevance since the it is on today s general - purpose hardware architectures not yet simply feasible to simulate the evolution of globular clusters with realistic particle numbers of a few hundred thousands or even millions of stars by means of direct @xmath9-body simulations .",
    "the result of fukushige & heggie has been applied in baumgardt ( 2001 ) to solve the important scaling problem for the dissolution time of star clusters in the special case of circular cluster orbits .",
    "the obtained scaling law @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the dissolution and half - mass relaxation times , respectively has been verified , e.g. in spurzem et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "the problem of escape has also a long history in the context of the theories of dynamical systems and chaos .",
    "it is well - known for a long time , that certain hamiltonian systems allow for escape of particles towards infinity .",
    "such `` open '' hamiltonian systems have been studied by rod ( 1973 ) , churchill et al .",
    "( 1975 ) , contopoulos ( 1990 ) , contopoulos & kaufmann ( 1992 ) , siopis et al . ( 1997 ) , navarro & henrard ( 2001 ) and schneider , tl & neufeld ( 2002 ) . the related chaotic scattering process , in which a particle approaches a dynamical system from infinity , interacts with the system and leaves it , escaping to infinity , was investigated by many authors , as eckhardt & jung ( 1986 ) , jung ( 1987 ) , jung & scholz ( 1987 ) , eckhardt ( 1987 ) , jung & pott ( 1989 ) , bleher , ott & grebogi ( 1989 ) and jung & ziemniak ( 1992 ) .",
    "chaotic scattering in the restricted three - body problem has been studied by benet et al .",
    "( 1997 , 1999 ) .",
    "typically , the infinity acts as an attractor for an escaping particle , which may escape through different exits in the equipotential surfaces .",
    "thus it is possible to obtain basins of escape ( or `` exit '' basins ) , similar to basins of attraction in dissipative systems or the well - known newton - raphson fractals .",
    "special types of basins of attraction ( i.e. `` riddled '' or `` intermingled '' basins ) have been explored by ott et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and sommerer & ott ( 1993 , 1996 ) .",
    "basins of escape have been studied by bleher et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , and they are discussed in contopoulos ( 2002 ) .",
    "reasearch on escape from the paradigmatic hnon - heiles system has been done by de moura & letelier ( 1999 ) , aguirre , vallejo & sanjun ( 2001 ) , aguirre & sanjun ( 2003 ) , aguirre , vallejo & sanjun ( 2003 ) , aguirre ( 2004 ) and seoane seoane seplveda ( 2007 ) .",
    "these papers served as the basis of this work . relatively early , it was recognized , that the key to the understanding of the the chaotic scattering process is a fractal structure in phase space which has the form of a cantor set ( cantor 1884 ) and is called the chaotic saddle .",
    "its skeleton consists of unstable periodic orbits ( of any period ) which are dense on the chaotic saddle ( e.g. lai 1997 ) and introduce chaos into the system ( e.g. contopoulos 2002 ) .",
    "the properties of chaotic saddles have been investigated by different authors , as hunt ( 1996 ) , lai et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , lai ( 1997 ) or motter & lai ( 2001 ) . both hyperbolic and non - hyperbolic chaotic saddles occur in dynamical systems . in the first case , there are no kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) tori , which means that all periodic orbits are unstable . in the second case , there are both kam tori and chaotic sets in the phase space ( j. c. vallejo , priv . comm . and e.g. lai et al . 1993 ) .",
    "we note that all of the above references on the chaotic dynamics are exemplary rather than exhaustive since there exists a vast amount of literature on these topics .",
    "the aim of this paper is to allude to the importance of this last - mentioned branch of research for the field of stellar dynamics of star clusters .",
    "we will study the escape process from star clusters within the framework of chaotic dynamics .",
    "in section 2 , we introduce the tidal approximation , i.e. approximate equations of motion for stellar orbits in a star cluster which is embedded in the tidal field of a galaxy . in section 3",
    ", we describe our ( very simple ) model of the gravitational potential . in section 4",
    ", we discuss poincar surfaces of section , which show the effect of a coriolis asymmetry .",
    "furthermore , we discuss the basins of escape in section 5 and the chaotic saddle and its stable and unstable invariant manifolds in section 6 .",
    "section 7 contains the discussion and conclusions .",
    "the `` tidal approximation '' which is widely used in stellar and galactic dynamics for studies of stellar systems in a tidal field is nothing else than a simple approximation which , historically , has been applied already in the @xmath15th century in `` hill s problem '' ( e.g. stumpff 1965 , szebehely 1967 , siegel & moser 1971 ) in the context of the ( rather intricate ) lunar theory .",
    "the difference to the tidal approximation lies merely in the form of the gravitational potentials which are used . the assumption that a star cluster moves around the galactic centre on a circular orbit allows to use the epicyclic approximation to calculate steady linear tidal forces acting on the stars in the star cluster . as in the circular restricted three - body problem the appropriate coordinate system is a rotating reference frame in which both the star cluster centre and the galactic centre ( i.e. , the primaries ) are at rest . its origin is the star cluster centre , sitting in the minimum of the effective galactic potential .",
    "the x - axis points away from the galactic centre ; the y - axis points in the direction of the rotation of the star cluster around the galactic centre ; the z - axis lies perpendicular to the orbital plane and points towards the galactic north pole .",
    "we define scaled corotating coordinates @xmath16 as    @xmath17    where @xmath18",
    "are galactocentric cylindrical coordinates , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the radius and the frequency of the circular orbit , respectively , @xmath21 is a length scale ( i.e. the tidal radius defined in equation ( [ eq : rtidal ] ) below ) and @xmath22 is time ( in the context of `` hill s problem '' cf .",
    "glaschke 2006 ) .",
    "since the coordinate system is rotating , centrifugal and coriolis forces appear according to classical mechanics . in addition",
    ", tidal forces enter the equations of motion for stellar orbits near the origin of coordinates .",
    "to first order , we have in the rotating frame    @xmath23    where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the star cluster potential and the axisymmetric galactic potential , respectively . the second - last term on the right hand side in ( [ eq : eqm1b ] ) is the centrifugal force and the last terms in ( [ eq : eqm1b ] ) and ( [ eq : eqm2b ] ) are coriolis forces . according to binney & tremaine ( 1987 ) ,",
    "the epicyclic frequency @xmath26 and the vertical frequency @xmath27 are given by    @xmath28    thus the equations of motion can be written as    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the ( specific ) force vector from the other cluster member stars which typically depends non - linearly on the coordinates .",
    "it is of interest for the following discussion that the equations of motion ( [ eq : eqm1 ] ) - ( [ eq : eqm3 ] ) are invariant under time reversal . ) - ( [ eq : eqm3 ] ) . in our case , the effective potential ( [ eq : effpot ] ) and the coriolis forces are time - symmetric , which implies the same symmetry of the equations of motion . ]",
    "note that under a time reversal the frequencies also change their sign . also , the equations of motion ( [ eq : eqm1 ] ) - ( [ eq : eqm3 ] ) admit an isolating integral of motion , the jacobian    @xmath31    where        @xmath32    is the effective potential , which is plotted in figure 1 for the 2d case .",
    "other isolating integrals are not given in the form of a simple analytical expression .",
    "however , some solutions of ( [ eq : eqm1 ] ) - ( [ eq : eqm3 ] ) are subject to a third integral ( hnon & heiles 1964 ) , as has been demonstrated numerically by fukushige & heggie ( 2000 ) , who calculated a poincar surface of section . in principle , one may obtain power series expansions of such third integrals , see , e.g. the original works by gustavson ( 1966 ) and finkler , jones & sowell ( 1990 ) and the review in moser ( 1968 ) .",
    "also , third integrals can be related to the existence of killing tensor fields which are well - known in general relativity ( clementi & pettini 2002 ) . at last , the tidal radius ( king 1962 )    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the star cluster mass , provides a fundamental length scale of the problem .",
    "it is the distance from the origin of coordinates to the lagrangian points @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( which lie on the @xmath35 axis , see figure [ fig : effpot ] ) .",
    "the characteristic frequencies @xmath36 and @xmath27 arise as properties of the galactic gravitational potential . throughout the paper ,",
    "we use the values of the characteristic frequencies in the solar neighborhood .",
    "all of them can be expressed in terms of oort s constants @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( see , e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 ) : @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "the vertical frequency @xmath27 can be derived from the poisson equation for an axisymmetric system ( see oort 1965 ) and @xmath43 is the local galactic density , which contributes to the dominant first term .",
    "we obtain both dimensionless parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 using the values of oort s constants given in feast & whitelock ( 1997 ) and the value for local galactic density given in holmberg & flynn ( 2000 ) .",
    "it is then convenient to choose the following system of units :    @xmath46    the resulting length unit is the tidal radius @xmath21 and the formulation of the dynamical problem with its equations of motion is completely dimensionless . for the star cluster ,",
    "we use a plummer model , the most simple analytic model for a star cluster ( see appendix a ) .",
    "the density profiles of king models which have a cutoff radius , where the density drops to zero , fit the measured density profiles of globular clusters better than plummer models ( king 1966 ) .",
    "since they are tidally limited by construction , they are at first glance ideally suited for our purpose .",
    "however , the gravitational force field can only be tabulated from a numerical integration of a non - linear differential equation .",
    "we have made a compromise which is not relevant for the interesting physics : we choose the plummer radius in such a way , that the plummer model ( see appendix a ) is the best fit to a king model with @xmath47 ( i.e. with concentration @xmath48 ) , which completely fills the roche lobe in the tidal field , i.e. the density of the king model approaches zero at the tidal radius ( [ eq : rtidal ] ) .",
    "the fit of the density profiles is quite acceptable for density contrasts of @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the central density and the density as a function of radius , respectively . for the deviation between the king density profile and the plummer fit",
    "we obtain @xmath52 .",
    "the ratio of the plummer radius to the king radius and the `` concentration '' of the plummer model ( which can only be defined because of the existence of a tidal radius ) are then @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively . in our units ,",
    "the plummer radius is therefore @xmath55 .    as a more technical remark",
    ", we note that we used an @xmath56th - order runge - kutta scheme for the orbit integrations .",
    "the relative error in the jacobian @xmath57 was always limited to @xmath58 for all orbit integrations .",
    ". left : regular retrograde orbit , right : chaotic prograde orbit .",
    "the variable @xmath59 is defined in equation ( [ eq : chat]).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]     or @xmath1 .",
    "only schematically , two orbits are shown which cross the @xmath35 axis with @xmath60.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    a critical jacobi constant    @xmath61    is given by the value of the effective potential ( [ eq : effpot ] ) at the lagrangian points @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "for our model we have @xmath62 . for a jacobian @xmath63",
    "the equipotential surfaces are open and particles can escape . furthermore , we define the dimensionless deviation from @xmath64 by    @xmath65    where @xmath57 is some other value of the jacobian .",
    "the dimensionless deviation @xmath59 is positive for @xmath63 if @xmath57 and @xmath64 are both negative , which is always the case in this paper .",
    "a first insight can be gained by calculating poincar surfaces of section which are shown in figure [ fig : poincare ] for two different jacobi constants : the upper left surface of section is at the critical jacobian @xmath64 at which all orbits still remain within a bounded area in phase space and we have no escapers .",
    "we can see that this is a system with divided phase space , i.e. we have both chaotic and regular orbits .",
    "it is striking that the left half of the surface of section is almost completely occupied by regular , quasiperiodic orbits .",
    "these orbits are retrograde with respect to the orbit of the star cluster around the galactic centre ( fukushige & heggie 2000 ) , as can be seen by looking at the sketch in figure [ fig : sketch ] , and they are subject to a third integral of motion . on the other hand , most of the prograde orbits are chaotic apart from a few smaller regular islands .",
    "since the effective potential is mirror - symmetrical with respect to both the @xmath35- and @xmath66-axes ( see figure [ fig : effpot ] ) , the asymmetry seen in the surfaces of section must be due to the coriolis forces .",
    "thus such a behaviour might be termed a `` coriolis asymmetry '' ( cf .",
    "innanen 1980 ) .",
    "the coriolis forces are special in the sense that their direction is not perpendicular to the tangent plane to the equipotential surfaces but to the velocity of a particle .",
    "the upper right surface of section is at a higher jacobi constant .",
    "the particles can leak out through the openings in the equipotential surfaces and escape towards infinity ( positive @xmath35-direction ) or the galactic centre ( negative @xmath35-direction ) .",
    "it is remarkable , that only the chaotic orbits escape , while the regular , quasiperiodic orbits remain within the tidal boundary of the star cluster , since the third integral restricts their accessible phase space and hinders their escape . in star clusters ,",
    "two - body relaxation may scatter stellar orbits beyond the critical jacobi constant .",
    "however , if the orbits are retrograde , the stars will remain bound to the star cluster with high probability until two - body relaxation further scatters them into the escaping phase space .",
    "the two lower surfaces of section in figure [ fig : poincare ] indicate the orbital structure in position space at @xmath67 , where all orbits are restricted to the region within the almond - shaped tidal boundary of the star cluster ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : effpot ] ) .",
    "one notes that certain parts of the chaotic regions of the lower surfaces of section are less densely filled by stellar orbits which is a common property of dynamical systems .",
    "figure [ fig : orbit2d ] shows typical examples of the two main types of orbits .",
    "the regular orbit resembles a rosette orbit in an axisymmetric potential or a loop orbit which suggests that the third integral is some sort of generalization of angular momentum ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "we found indeed that the angular momentum is approximately conserved for the left orbit of figure [ fig : orbit2d ] , while it is not at all conserved for the right orbit .",
    "other types of orbits can be found which are associated with the smaller regular islands in the surfaces of section and which may look rather interesting . at last , we remark that the difference between retrograde and prograde orbits appears prominently in @xmath9-body models of dissolving _ rotating _ star clusters within the framework of the tidal approximation : where either the regular or the chaotic domains in phase space are more strongly occupied by stellar orbits due to the existence of a net angular momentum of the cluster in one direction ( see ernst et al . 2007 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : basins ] shows the basins of escape for a tidally limited star cluster within the framework of the tidal approximation . for the plots on the left - hand side ,",
    "@xmath68 orbits have been integrated ; for the plots on the right - hand side , it were @xmath69 orbits , depending on the area of the surface of section containing initial conditions .",
    "the phase space is divided into the escaping phase space ( red and yellow regions ) and the non - escaping phase space ( black regions ) .",
    "the red regions denote initial conditions , where the escaping stars pass @xmath0 while the yellow regions represent initial conditions , where the escaping stars pass @xmath1 .",
    "the black regions show those initial conditions , where stars do not escape .",
    "these are first and foremost the regular regions where a third integral is present .",
    "note that the stable manifold of the chaotic saddle is not marked in black , since it is of lebesgue measure zero ( cf . section 6 ) .",
    "since there exist regular regions ( with kam tori ) , the system is non - hyperbolic , i.e. there exist stable periodic orbits with corresponding elliptic points in the surfaces of section ( cf .",
    "section 4 and figure [ fig : poincare ] ) .",
    "we can see that in the escaping phase space there exist regions , where we have a very sensitive dependance of the escape process on the initial conditions , i.e. a slight change of the initial conditions makes the star escape through the opposite lagrangian point .",
    "this is the classical indication of chaos .",
    "it is interesting to note that these regions arise from immediate vicinity of the black regions where orbits are regular . in these domains of phase space the red and yellow regions",
    "are completely intertwined with respect to each other : the boundary between these regions is fractal .",
    "the volume in phase space occupied by these regions ( with sensitive dependance on the initial conditions ) increases as the jacobian @xmath57 approaches the critical jacobi constant @xmath64 ( i.e. in the limit @xmath70 ) and the exits become smaller . at @xmath70",
    "there is a maximal `` fractalization '' of phase space ; when the system approaches the limit of small exits the basins become uncertain ( aguirre & sanjun 2003 ) .",
    "the term `` uncertain '' means that we become unable to follow the real trajectory of a particle by means of numerical integration .",
    "moreover , the following theorem can be formulated : `` _ for all points @xmath71 in the escaping phase space of an open hamiltonian system , and for all @xmath72 ( precision of the experiment ) , there exists a critical size of the exits @xmath73 such that for all @xmath74 we can find a point @xmath75 in a ball centreed in p and radius @xmath76 that belongs to a different basin than @xmath71 _ '' ( aguirre & sanjun 2003 ) .",

    "it is the invariant set of non - escaping orbits for time @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the chaotic saddle has the form of a cantor set ( cantor 1884 ) which is formed by the intersection of its stable and unstable manifolds .",
    "the fact that the system is non - hyperbolic implies that there are tangencies between the stable and unstable manifolds , i.e. that their angle is not always bounded away from zero ( lai et al .",
    "the unstable ( hyperbolic ) points in the intersection of the poincar surface of section with the chaotic saddle correspond to unstable periodic orbits . as is well - known ( e.g. contopoulos 2002 ) ,",
    "these introduce chaos into the system since they repel the orbits in their neighbourhood in the direction of their unstable eigenvectors .",
    "the remarkable similarity of our system with the hnon - heiles system ( see aguirre , vallejo & sanjun 2001 ) is that the fractal dimension of the chaotic saddle tends to three ( i.e. the black areas in figure [ fig : saddle ] grow until we have a maximal fractalization of the phase space , cf .",
