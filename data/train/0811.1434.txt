    "at present there is much interest in a precise experimental determination of the pion electric and magnetic polarizabilities , @xmath12 and @xmath13 . within the framework of current algebra @xcite it has been shown ( long ago ) that the polarizability difference @xmath14 of the charged pion is directly related to the axial - vector - to - vector form factor ratio @xmath15 measured in the radiative pion decay @xmath16 @xcite . at leading ( nontrivial ) order the result of chiral perturbation theory @xcite , @xmath17 ,",
    "is of course the same after identifying the low - energy constant as @xmath18 .",
    "recently , the systematic corrections to this current algebra result have been worked out in refs.@xcite by performing a full two - loop calculation of ( real ) pion compton scattering in chiral perturbation theory .",
    "the outcome of that extensive analysis is that altogether the higher order corrections are rather small and the value @xmath19@xmath20",
    "@xcite for the pion polarizability difference stands now as a firm prediction of the ( chiral - invariant ) theory . the non - vanishing value @xmath21@xmath20 @xcite for the pion polarizability sum ( obtained also at two - loop order ) is presumably much too small to cause an observable effect in low - energy pion compton scattering .",
    "however , the chiral prediction @xmath22@xmath20 is in conflict with the existing experimental determinations of @xmath23@xmath20 from serpukhov @xcite and @xmath24@xmath20 from mainz @xcite , which amount to values more than twice as large .",
    "certainly , these existing experimental determinations of @xmath14 raise doubts about their correctness since they violate the chiral low - energy theorem notably by a factor 2 .    in that contradictory situation",
    "it is promising that the ongoing compass @xcite experiment at cern aims at measuring the pion polarizabilities with high statistics using the primakoff effect .",
    "the scattering of high - energy negative pions in the coulomb field of a heavy nucleus ( of charge @xmath25 ) gives access to cross sections for @xmath7 reactions through the equivalent photons method @xcite . in practice ,",
    "one preferentially analyzes the spectrum of bremsstrahlung photons produced in the reaction @xmath26 in the so - called coulomb peak .",
    "this kinematical regime is characterized by very small momentum transfers to the nuclear target such that virtual pion compton scattering @xmath27 occurs as the dominant subprocess ( in the one - photon exchange approximation ) .",
    "the deviations of the measured spectra ( at low @xmath28 center - of - mass energies ) from those of a point - like pion are then attributed to the pion structure as represented by its electric and magnetic polarizability @xcite ( taking often @xmath29 as a constraint ) .",
    "it should be stressed here that the systematic treatment of virtual pion compton scattering @xmath30 in chiral perturbation theory yields at the same order as the polarizability difference @xmath14 a further pion - structure effect in form of a unique pion - loop correction @xcite ( interpretable as photon scattering off the `` pion - cloud around the pion '' ) . in the case of real pion compton scattering @xmath31",
    "this loop correction compensates partly the effects from the pion polarizability difference @xcite . a minimal requirement for improving future analyses of pion - nucleus bremsstrahlung @xmath32",
    "is therefore to include the loop correction predicted by chiral perturbation theory .",
    "the relevant analytical formulas for doing this have been written down in the appendix of ref.@xcite .    at the required level of accuracy",
    "it is also necessary to include higher order electromagnetic corrections to the pion - nucleus bremsstrahlung reaction @xmath33 .",
    "such radiative corrections have been considered some time ago in the works of akhundov et al .",
    "@xcite and they have been implemented into the numerical program called rcforgv .",
    "unfortunately , no accessible sources to the underlying analytical expressions for the photon - loop amplitudes ( which are necessary for an independent implementation into new data analyses ) have been given by these authors .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to fill this gap .",
    "we will re - evaluate the one - photon loop radiative corrections to virtual pion compton scattering @xmath27 and present for each class of diagrams the corresponding analytical expressions . the calculation gets considerably simplified by considering the t - matrix of @xmath27 in the laboratory frame and exploiting the circumstance that the time - like polarization vector @xmath34 of the virtual photon is orthogonal to the space - like polarization vector @xmath35 of the real bremsstrahlung photon . incorporating furthermore crossing - symmetry",
    ", one finds that only two dimensionless amplitudes , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , depending on three dimensionless lorentz - invariant kinematical variables , need to be specified .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section2",
    ", we review the cross section for pion - nucleus bremsstrahlung ( in the one - photon exchange approximation ) and define the t - matrix of virtual pion compton scattering @xmath36 in the laboratory frame together with the tree - level born contributions .",
    "section3 is devoted to the calculation of the one - photon loop radiative corrections .",
    "we present analytical expressions for the amplitudes @xmath3 and @xmath4 of order @xmath37 as they emerge from 9 classes of one - photon loop diagrams .",
    "dimensional regularization is used to treat both ultraviolet and infrared divergencies of the loop integrals .",
    "while the ultraviolet divergencies drop out in the renormalizable scalar quantum electrodynamics at work , the infrared divergencies get removed ( in the standard way ) by including soft photon radiation below an energy cut - off @xmath6 .",
    "we evaluate in section4 the resulting finite ( real ) radiative correction factor @xmath38 with a small energy cut - off @xmath6 introduced in the @xmath28 center - of - mass frame .",
    "numerical results are presented for this part of the radiative corrections in the region of low @xmath28 invariant masses , where pion - nucleus bremsstrahlung is used to extract the pion polarizabilities .",
    "the detailed evaluation of the finite ( virtual ) radiative correction factor is not possible at this stage , since it requires specification and implementation of the actual experimental conditions ( such as pion beam energy , constraints on the detectable energy and angular ranges , etc . ) .",
    "in section5 , we go beyond the works of akhundov et al . @xcite and extend the calculation of the radiative corrections to virtual pion compton scattering @xmath27 by including the leading pion structure effect ( at low energies ) in form of the polarizability difference @xmath39 . in an effective field theory approach this feature can be elegantly handled by a suitable ( gauge - invariant ) two - photon contact - vertex . in the appendix",
    ", we study some two - photon exchange processes specific to scalar quantum electrodynamics which turn out to be negligibly small .",
    "our analytical results for the radiative corrections to virtual pion compton scattering can be utilized for analyzing the data of the compass experiment at cern which aims at measuring the pion polarizabilities via high - energy pion - nucleus bremsstrahlung @xmath40 .",
    "in order to keep this paper self - contained , we start with reviewing the cross section for pion - nucleus bremsstrahlung in the one - photon exchange approximation",
    ". consider the process , @xmath41 , where a virtual photon transfers the ( small ) momentum @xmath42 from the nucleus ( of charge @xmath25 ) at rest to the ( high - energetic ) charged pion .",
    "the extremely small recoil energy @xmath43 of the nucleus can be ( safely ) neglected .",
    "the corresponding fivefold differential cross section in the laboratory frame reads @xcite : @xmath44 with @xmath45 the fine - structure constant and @xmath46 a squared amplitude summed over the final state ( real ) photon polarizations @xmath47 : @xmath48 it has been derived from a t - matrix for the virtual compton scattering subprocess , @xmath49 , of the form @xmath50 with @xmath51 and @xmath52 two ( in general complex ) amplitudes . since the electromagnetic interaction with the heavy nucleus involves only the charge density , the polarization four - vector of the virtual ( coulomb ) photon has only a time - component : @xmath53 .",
    "the quantities @xmath54 and @xmath55 in eq.(2 ) are the angles between the momentum vectors @xmath56 and @xmath57 and between @xmath56 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "moreover , @xmath59 is the angle between the two planes spanned by @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the photon energy is denoted by @xmath62 , where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the initial and final pion energies in the laboratory frame .",
    "taking into account crossing - symmetry , the t - matrix for virtual pion compton scattering , @xmath65 , in the laboratory frame can be further decomposed as : @xmath66 + \\vec \\epsilon^{\\,\\ , * } \\cdot \\vec p_2 \\big [ e_1 \\ , b(u , s , q)+ e_2 \\ , a(u , s , q)\\big]\\bigg\\ } \\,.\\ ] ] here , we have introduced the ( convenient ) dimensionless mandelstam variables : @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( given by lorentz - squares of momentum four - vectors ) , which obey the constraint @xmath71 . in the physical region one has : @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the less obvious condition @xmath76 can be deduced by considering its left hand side in the @xmath28 center - of - mass frame . due to the prefactor @xmath77 in eq.(3 )",
    "the two independent amplitudes @xmath3 and @xmath4 become also dimensionless quantities .",
    "the crossing symmetry of the t - matrix , which corresponds to an invariance under the transformation @xmath78 and @xmath79 , is manifest according to the decomposition written in eq.(3 ) .",
    "the advantage of working with dimensionless amplitudes and variables shows up already when calculating the born terms for a point - like pion .",
    "the ( three ) tree diagrams of scalar quantum electrodynamics shown in fig.1 lead to the following extremely simple expressions : @xmath80 where we suppress from now on the dependence of @xmath3 and @xmath4 on the third variable @xmath5 . note that the right diagram in fig.1 involving the two - photon contact - vertex of scalar qed vanishes , due to the orthogonality of the time - like virtual photon and the space - like real photon polarizations , @xmath81 . the @xmath82-channel pole term ( generated by the left diagram in fig.1 ) enters into the t - matrix through the ( crossed ) amplitude @xmath83 .",
    "the contributions of the pion polarizabilities ( predominantly their difference @xmath84 ) to the amplitudes @xmath85 and @xmath86 can be found in eq.(27 ) .",
    "in this section , we present analytical results for the one - photon loop radiative corrections of order @xmath37 to the invariant amplitudes @xmath85 and @xmath86 of virtual pion compton scattering .",
    "we use the method of dimensional regularization to treat both ultraviolet and infrared divergencies ( where the latter are caused by the masslessness of the photon ) .",
    "the method consists in calculating loop integrals in @xmath87 spacetime dimensions and expanding the results around @xmath88 .",
    "divergent pieces of one - loop integrals generically show up in form of the composite constant : @xmath89 containing a simple pole at @xmath88 .",
    "in addition , @xmath90 is the euler - mascheroni number and @xmath91 an arbitrary mass scale introduced in dimensional regularization in order to keep the mass dimension of the loop integrals independent of @xmath87 .",
    "ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) divergencies are distinguished by the feature of whether the condition for convergence of the @xmath87-dimensional integral is @xmath92 or @xmath93 .",
    "we discriminate them in the notation by putting appropriate subscripts , i.e. @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the basic aspects of mass @xmath96 and coupling constant @xmath97 renormalization in scalar qed have been discussed in section 2 of ref.@xcite .",
    "the gauge condition @xmath98 eliminates those ( five ) loop diagrams where both the incoming virtual photon and the outgoing real photon are connected by the two - photon contact - vertex of scalar qed ( in first or second order ) .",
    "one can also drop the diagrams with a tadpole - type self - energy insertion ( the loop consisting of a single closed photon line ) since it is set to zero in dimensional regularization .",
    "thus we are left with 24 one - photon loop diagrams which we group into the ( separately crossing - symmetric ) classes i - ix , shown in figs.2 - 10 . due to an increasing number of internal pion propagators their evaluation rises in complexity . in order to simplify all calculations ,",
    "we employ the feynman gauge , where the photon propagator is directly proportional to the minkowski metric tensor @xmath99 .",
    "we can now enumerate the analytical expressions for @xmath85 and @xmath86 as they emerge from the 9 classes of contributing one - photon loop diagrams .        : for this class of diagrams the tree level amplitude in eq.(4 )",

    "it would be most important to clarify , whether these non - perturbative corrections are the same for pions and electrons or not .      as a supplement to the subject ,",
    "we evaluate in this appendix those two - photon exchange contributions ( of order @xmath214 in the transition amplitude ) which are specific to the two - photon contact - vertex of scalar qed .",
    "the pertinent one - loop diagrams are shown in fig.16 .",
    "additionally possible box and crossed box type diagrams , where one exchanged virtual photon and the emitted real photon are connected by the contact - vertex vanish as a consequence of the gauge condition @xmath98 .",
    "for the evaluation of the ( triangular ) loop we use a non - relativistic ( static ) propagator @xmath215 for the intermediate heavy nucleus . by dividing out the factor",
    "@xmath216 we can translate the two - photon exchange processes into a correction to the t - matrix @xmath181 of virtual pion compton scattering . putting all pieces together we find from the photon - loop diagrams in fig.16 the following contribution : @xmath217 it has a structure very similar to the t - matrix in born approximation ( see eqs.(3,4 ) ) . making this comparison explicitly ,",
    "one deduces that the coupling terms @xmath218 in eq.(37 ) carry the relative suppression factors @xmath219 , respectively .",
    "although @xmath220 is already sizeable for a lead target ( @xmath207 ) , the ratio @xmath221 of ( virtual photon ) momentum transfer to beam or scattered pion energy reduces it by at least three orders of magnitude .",
    "we are considering here the typical kinematical situation , @xmath222gev and @xmath223mev , where high - energy pion - nucleus bremsstrahlung @xmath224 is used to extract the pion polarizabilities .",
    "in passing we note that the diagrams in fig.16 with the contact - vertex replaced by the polarizability vertex give rise to a t - matrix that differs from eq.(37 ) merely by an additional prefactor @xmath225 ( using @xmath226@xmath20 ) .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the two - photon exchange mechanisms in fig.16 , specific to the pseudo - scalar pion , are negligibly small .",
