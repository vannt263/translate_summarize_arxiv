    "as an approximation to control problems for critically - loaded stochastic networks , harrison ( in @xcite , see also @xcite ) has formulated a stochastic control problem in which the state process is driven by a multidimensional brownian motion along with an additive control that satisfies certain feasibility and nonnegativity constraints .",
    "this control problem , that is , usually referred to as the _ brownian control problem _ ( bcp ) has been one of the key developments in the heavy traffic theory of controlled stochastic processing networks ( spn ) .",
    "bcps can be regarded as formal scaling limits for a broad range of scheduling and sequencing control problems for multiclass queuing networks .",
    "finding optimal ( or even near - optimal ) control policies for such networks  which may have quite general non - markovian primitives , multiple server capabilities and rather complex routing geometry  is in general prohibitive . in that regard ,",
    "bcps that provide significantly more tractable approximate models are very useful . in this diffusion approximation approach to policy synthesis , one first finds an optimal ( or near - optimal ) control for the bcp which is then suitably interpreted to construct a scheduling policy for the underlying physical network . in recent years",
    "there have been many works @xcite that consider specific network models for which the associated bcp is explicitly solvable ( i.e. , an optimal control process can be written as a known function of the driving brownian motions ) and , by suitably adapting the solution to the underlying network , construct control policies that are asymptotically ( in the heavy traffic limit ) optimal .",
    "the paper @xcite also carries out a  similar program for the crisscross network where the state ",
    "space is three dimensional , although an explicit solution for the bcp here is not available .",
    "although now there are several papers which establish a rigorous connection between a network control problem and its associated bcp by exploiting the explicit form of the solution of the latter , a systematic theory which justifies the use of bcps as approximate models has been missing . in a recent work @xcite it was shown that for a large family of _ unitary networks _",
    "( following terminology of @xcite , these are networks with a structure as described in section [ secsetup ] ) , with general interarrival and service times , probabilistic routing and an infinite horizon discounted linear holding cost , the cost associated with any admissible control policy for the network is asymptotically , in the heavy traffic limit , bounded below by the value function of the bcp .",
    "this inequality , which provides a useful bound on the best achievable asymptotic performance for an admissible control policy , was a key step in developing a rigorous general theory relating bcps with spn in heavy traffic .",
    "the current paper is devoted to the proof of the reverse inequality .",
    "the network model is required to satisfy assumptions made in @xcite ( these are summarized above theorem [ ab937 ] ) .",
    "in addition , we impose a nondegeneracy condition ( assumption  [ non - deg ] ) , a condition on the underlying renewal processes regarding probabilities of deviations from the mean ( assumption  [ ldp ] ) and regularity of a certain skorohod map ( assumption  [ ab1012 ] ) ( see next paragraph for a discussion of these conditions ) . under these assumptions",
    "we prove that the value function of the bcp is bounded below by the heavy traffic limit ( limsup ) of the value functions of the network control problem ( theorem  [ main1016 ] ) . combining this with the result obtained in @xcite ( see theorem  [ ab937 ] )",
    ", we obtain the main result of the paper ( theorem [ maincorr ] ) .",
    "this theorem says that , under broad conditions , the value function of the network control problem converges to that of the bcp .",
    "this result provides , under general conditions , a rigorous basis for regarding bcps as approximate models for critically loaded stochastic networks .",
    "conditions imposed in this paper allow for a wide range of spn models .",
    "some such models , whose description is taken from @xcite , are discussed in detail in examples [ exammodel](a)(c ) .",
    "we note that our approach does not require the bcp to be explicitly solvable and the result covers many settings where explicit solutions are unavailable . most of the conditions that we impose are quite standard and we only comment here on three of them : assumptions [ ab148 ] , [ g - column ] and [ ab1012 ] .",
    "assumption [ ab148 ] says that each buffer is processed by at least one basic activity ( see remark [ rem - ht ] ) .",
    "this condition , which was introduced in  @xcite , is fundamental for our analysis .",
    "in fact , @xcite  has shown that without this assumption even the existence of a nonnegative workload matrix may fail .",
    "assumption [ g - column ] is a natural condition on the geometry of the underlying network . roughly speaking",
    ", it says that a nonzero control action leads to a  nonzero state displacement .",
    "assumption [ ab1012 ] is the third key requirement in this work .",
    "it says that the skorohod problem associated with a certain reflection matrix @xmath0 [ see equation ( [ refmat ] ) for the definition of @xmath0 ] is well posed and the associated skorohod map is lipschitz continuous . as example",
    "[ exammodel ] discusses , this condition holds for a broad family of networks ( including _ all _ multiclass open queuing networks , as well as a large family of parallel server networks and job - shop networks ) .",
    "the papers @xcite noted earlier , that treat the setting of explicitly solvable bcp , do much more than establish convergence of value functions .",
    "in particular , these works give an explicit implementable control policy for the underlying network that is asymptotically optimal in the heavy traffic limit . in the generality treated in the current work , giving explicit recipes ( e.g. , threshold type policies ) is unfeasible , however , the policy sequence constructed in section [ subconstruct ] suggests a general approach for building near asymptotically optimal policies for the network _ given _ a near optimal control for the bcp .",
    "obtaining near optimal controls for the bcp in general requires numerical approaches ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , discussion of which is beyond the scope of the current work .",
    "we now briefly describe some of the ideas in the proof of the main result ",
    "theorem [ main1016 ] .",
    "we begin by choosing , for an arbitrary @xmath2 , a suitable @xmath3-optimal control @xmath4 for the bcp and then , using @xmath4 , construct a sequence of control policies @xmath5 for the network model such that the ( suitably scaled ) cost associated with @xmath6 converges to that associated with @xmath4 , as @xmath7 .",
    "this yields the desired reverse inequality .",
    "one of the key difficulties is in the translation of a given control for the bcp to that for the physical network .",
    "indeed , a ( near ) optimal control for the bcp can be a very general adapted process with rcll paths . without additional information on such a stochastic process",
    ", it is not at all clear how one adapts and applies it to a given network model .",
    "a control policy for the network needs to specify how each server distributes its effort among various job classes at any given time instant . by a series of approximations",
    "we show that one can find a  rather simple @xmath3-optimal control for the bcp , that is , easy to interpret and implement on a network control problem . as a first step , using pde characterization results for general singular control problems with state constraints from @xcite ( these , in particular , make use of the nondegeneracy assumption  assumption [ non - deg ] ) , one can argue that a near - optimal control can be taken to be adapted to the driving brownian motion and be further assumed to have moments that are subexponential in the time variable ( see lemma [ cont - bcp ] ) . using results from @xcite , one can perturb this control so that it has continuous sample paths without significantly affecting the cost .",
    "next , using ideas developed by kushner and martins @xcite in the context of a two - dimensional bcp , one can further approximate such a control by a process with a fixed ( nonrandom ) finite number of jumps that take values in a finite set . two main requirements ( in addition to the usual adaptedness condition ) for such a process to be an admissible control of a bcp ( see definition [ bcp ] ) are the nonnegativity constraints ( [ ab934 ] ) and state constraints ( [ ab440 ] ) .",
    "it is relatively easy to construct a pure jump process that satisfies the first requirement of admissibility , namely , the nonnegativity constraints , however , the nondegenerate brownian motion in the dynamics rules out the satisfaction of the second requirement , that is , state constraints , without additional modifications .",
    "this is where the regularity assumption on a certain skorohod map ( assumption [ ab1012 ] ) is used .",
    "the pure jump control is modified in a manner such that in between successive jumps one uses the skorohod map to employ minimal control needed in order to respect state constraints .",
    "regularity of the skorohod problem ensures that this modification does not change the associated cost much .",
    "the skorohod map also plays a key role in the weak convergence arguments used to prove convergence of costs .",
    "the above construction is the essential content of theorem [ main - bcp ] .",
    "the @xmath3-optimal control that we use for the construction of the policy sequence requires two additional modifications [ see part ( iii ) of theorem [ main - bcp ] and below ( [ 111 ] ) ] which facilitate adapting such a control for the underlying physical network and in some weak convergence proofs , but we leave that discussion for later in section [ nearopt ] ( see remark [ on3 ] and above theorem [ newmain518 ] ) .    using a near - optimal control @xmath4 of the form given in section [ nearopt ] ( cf .",
    "theorem  [ newmain518 ] ) , we then proceed to construct a sequence of policies @xmath8 for the underlying network .",
    "the key relation that enables translation of @xmath4 into @xmath8 is ( [ y - defn ] ) using which one can loosely interpret @xmath9 as the asymptotic deviation , with suitable scaling , of @xmath10 from the nominal allocation @xmath11 ( see definition [ defn - ht ] for the definition of nominal allocation vector ) .",
    "recall that @xmath4 is constructed by modifying , through a skorohod constraining mechanism , a pure jump process ( say , @xmath12 ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath4  has sample paths that are , in general , discontinuous . on the other hand , note that an admissible policy  @xmath6 is required to be a lipschitz function ( see remark [ rem921 ] ) .",
    "this suggests the following construction for @xmath6 . over time periods ( say , @xmath13 ) of constancy of  @xmath12",
    "one should use the nominal allocation ( i.e. , @xmath14 ) , while jump - instants should be stretched into periods of length of order @xmath15 ( note that in the scaled network , time is accelerated by a factor of @xmath16 and so such periods translate to intervals of length @xmath17 in the scaled evolution and thus are negligible ) over which a nontrivial control action is employed as dictated by the jump vector ( see figure  [ policyfig ] for a more complete description ) .",
    "this is analogous to the idea of a discrete review policy proposed by harrison @xcite ( see also @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "there are some obvious difficulties with the above prescription , for example , a nominal allocation corresponds to the average behavior of the system and for a given realization is feasible only when the buffers are nonempty .",
    "thus , one needs to modify the above construction to incorporate idleness , that is , caused due to empty buffers .",
    "the effect of such a modification is , of course , very similar to that of a skorohod constraining mechanism and it is tempting to hope that the deviation process corresponding to this modified policy converges to @xmath4 ( in an appropriate sense ) , as @xmath7 .",
    "however , without further modifications , it is not obvious that the reflection terms that are produced from the idling periods under this policy are asymptotically consistent with those obtained from the skorohod constraining mechanism applied to ( the state process corresponding to ) @xmath12 .",
    "the additional modification [ see ( [ ab543 ] ) ] that we make roughly says that jobs are processed from a given buffer over a small interval @xmath18 , only if at the beginning of this interval there are a `` sufficient '' number of jobs in the buffer .",
    "this idea of safety stocks is not new and has been used in previous works ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the modification , of course , introduces a  somewhat nonintuitive idleness even when there are jobs that require processing .",
    "however , the analysis of section [ secproof ] shows that this idleness does not significantly affect the asymptotic cost .",
    "the above very rough sketch of construction of  @xmath6 is made precise in section [ subconstruct ] .",
    "the rest of the paper is devoted to showing that the cost associated with  @xmath6 converges to that associated with @xmath4 .",
    "it is unreasonable to expect convergence of controls ( e.g. , with the usual skorohod topology)in particular , note that @xmath6 has lipschitz paths for every @xmath15 while @xmath4 is a ( modification of ) a  pure jump process ",
    "however , one finds that the convergence of costs holds .",
    "this convergence proof , and the related weak convergence analysis , is carried out in sections [ secconvprf ] and [ weakcgce ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ secsetup ] describes the network structure , all the associated stochastic processes and the heavy - traffic assumptions as well as the other assumptions of the paper .",
    "the section also presents the spn control problem , that is , considered here , along with the main result of the paper ( theorem [ maincorr ] ) .",
    "section [ nearopt ] constructs ( see theorem [ newmain518 ] ) a  near - optimal control policy for the bcp which can be suitably adapted to the network control problem . in section [ secproof ] the near - optimal control policy from section [ nearopt ]",
    "is used to obtain a sequence of admissible control policies for the scaled spn .",
    "the main result of the section is theorem  [ mainweak ] , which establishes weak convergence of various scaled processes . convergence of costs ( i.e. , theorem [ jrtoj ] ) is an immediate consequence of this weak convergence result .",
    "theorem  [ maincorr ] then follows on combining theorem  [ jrtoj ] with results of @xcite ( stated as theorem [ ab937 ] in the current work ) .",
    "finally , the collects proofs of some auxiliary results .    the following notation will be used .",

    "we will call a function @xmath37 nonnegative if @xmath38 for all @xmath39 .",
    "a function @xmath37 is called nondecreasing if it is nondecreasing in each component . all ( stochastic ) processes in this work will have sample paths that are right continuous and have left limits , and thus can be regarded as @xmath40-valued random variables with a  suitable @xmath41 . for a polish space @xmath42 , @xmath43 will denote the corresponding borel sigma - field .",
