    "<S> we present the first @xmath0 ( conservative ) or @xmath1 ( sum of lines significance ) detection of two warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) filaments at @xmath2 , which we find along the line of sight to the blazar mkn  421 . </S>",
    "<S> these systems are detected through highly ionized resonant metal absorption in high quality _ chandra_-acis and -hrc low energy transmission grating ( letg ) spectra of mkn  421 , obtained following our two target of opportunity requests during two outburst phases ( @xmath3 and 60 mcrab ; 1 crab = 2@xmath4 erg s@xmath5 @xmath6 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> columns of he - like oxygen and h - like nitrogen can be detected in the coadded letg spectrum of mkn  421 down to a sensitivity of n@xmath7 @xmath6 and n@xmath8 @xmath6 respectively , at a significance @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the two intervening whim systems that we detect , have ovii and nvii columns of n@xmath10 @xmath6 n@xmath11 @xmath6 , and n@xmath12 @xmath6 , n@xmath13 @xmath6 respectively </S>",
    "<S> . we identify the closest of these two systems with an intervening whim filament at @xmath14 km s@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the second system , instead , at @xmath15 km s@xmath5 , is identified with an intervening whim filament located @xmath16 mpc from the blazar . </S>",
    "<S> the filament at @xmath14 lies @xmath17 mpc from a known hi ly@xmath18 system at @xmath19 km s@xmath5 ( shull et al . , </S>",
    "<S> 1996 ) whose 3@xmath20 maximal hi kinetic temperature , as derived from the observed line fwhm , is @xmath21 k. this temperature is inconsistent with the temperature measured for the x - ray filament , so if the systems are related a multiphase whim is required .    combining uv and fuv upper limits on the hi ly@xmath18 and the ovi@xmath22 transitions , with our measurements in the x - rays , </S>",
    "<S> we show that , for both filaments , equilibrium collisional ionization ( with residual photoionization by both the diffuse uv and x - ray background , and the beamed emission of mkn  421 along our line of sight ) provides acceptable solutions . </S>",
    "<S> these solutions define ranges of temperatures , metallicity ratios and equivalent h column densities , which are in good agreement with the predictions of hydrodynamical simulations for the formation of large scale structures in the universe .    from the detected number of whim filaments along this line of sight we can estimate the number of ovii filaments per unit redshift with columns larger than @xmath23 @xmath6 , @xmath24 , consistent , within the large 1@xmath20 errors , with the hydrodynamical simulation predictions of @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we measure a cosmological mass density of x - ray whim filaments @xmath26_{-1}}$ ] , consistent with both model predictions and the estimated number of missing baryons at low redshift . </S>"
