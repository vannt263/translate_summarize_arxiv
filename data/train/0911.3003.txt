    "it is a simple consequence of the quantum inverse scattering  @xcite formalism ( going back to baxter s ` z invariance '  @xcite ) that new integrable vertex models can be obtained from basic ones by allowing for some staggering of the spectral parameters .",
    "if the basic @xmath3-matrix is associated with a single crossing , one can in this way build ` block ' @xmath3-matrices , using @xmath4 crossings , with @xmath5 , and staggering the spectral parameters ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : r - stag ] ) .",
    "-matrices for a basic vertex model ( left ) , and for a staggered vertex model with @xmath6 ( right ) . ]    while constructing the model and writing down the bethe equations is straightforward , the physics of the models thus obtained presents interesting subtleties . a striking example was discussed in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , in relation with the antiferromagnetic potts model  @xcite .",
    "it was found then that the case @xmath6 for the six - vertex model has a non - compact continuum limit  @xcite in a certain regime of the spectral parameter ( see below for a more accurate definition ) , and may be related to the complex sine - gordon ( sg ) model . while major difficulties remain in this case , the other regime of the spectral parameter turns out to be also of interest , and somewhat more tractable .",
    "its study is the main goal of this paper .    before launching into details , a general discussion about vertex models",
    ", spin chains and field theories seems useful .",
    "indeed , the correspondence between integrable spin chains with @xmath7 or @xmath8 symmetry and quantum field theories has been investigated in great details already . in the antiferromagnetic regime , it is well known that a chain of spin @xmath9 corresponds to a level-@xmath10 weiss - zumino - witten ( wzw ) model in the @xmath7 case , and to a deformation of this theory in the cartan direction for @xmath8  @xcite",
    ". cursory examination of the literature would suggest nothing much remains to be done in this area .    from the @xmath11-matrix point of view ,",
    "models with higher values of the spin @xmath9 are obtained by projecting tensor products of ( @xmath10 ) fundamental representations of @xmath12 onto higher spin .",
    "this construction has a close parallel in conformal field theory ( cft ) , where higher level ( @xmath10 ) representations of current algebra are obtained by combining ( @xmath10 ) level one representations .",
    "there are several reasons why it would be interesting to build integrable models which are _ not _ projected onto irreducible @xmath12 components . in the case",
    "@xmath13 for instance , this would correspond to models of pairs of spin-@xmath14 variables .",
    "this can be reinterpreted more physically in terms of ladders , or , in terms of electron physics , pairs of wires or channels .",
    "the latter case is of the highest importance .",
    "for instance , the two - channel kondo model  @xcite or the two - channel interacting resonant level models  @xcite are usually solved by going to an even - odd basis , which effectively amounts to solving the problem in the level @xmath15 sector .",
    "many physical questions are however related to the mixture of the even and odd degrees of freedom  _ e.g. _ because it corresponds to transport of electrons between wires .",
    "the search for integrable cases where this mixture could be studied is a priority .    to have a better idea of what to expect , it is useful to turn to the cft point of view .",
    "imagine starting with two @xmath7 kac - moody algebras at level 1 , represented by the currents @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the sums @xmath19 are well known to provide then a kac - moody algebra at level 2 .",
    "of course , each level 1 corresponds to central charge @xmath20 , while level 2 has central charge @xmath21 .",
    "the point is that in taking two copies of level 1 , an ising model cft factors out , according to the well known - decomposition @xmath22 this can be illustrated quickly using bosonisation .",
    "introduce two chiral bosons @xmath23 with propagators @xmath24 the two level-1 current algebras are obtained through @xmath25 it is convenient to introduce now symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of the bosons : @xmath26 so we have @xmath27 the field @xmath28 is a majorana fermion  @xcite . the field @xmath29 is another one , which is orthogonal to the currents @xmath30 , and is discarded in the construction of @xmath31 . corresponding to this splitting , the sum @xmath32 of the two one - boson hamiltonians decomposes as @xmath33 where @xmath34 , and @xmath30 are the currents at level two .",
    "quantum deformations of @xmath31 are obtained by adding to the hamiltonian @xmath35 a cartan deformation proportional to @xmath36 .",
    "we can as well deform the full hamiltonian , obtaining in this way a theory made of two majorana fermions and one boson with anisotropy - dependent radius .",
    "this should be the continuum limit of the models we are after .",
    "we will show in the following that these models are obtained by the general staggering construction , with @xmath6 and an appropriate choice of the spectral parameters .",
    "interestingly , it can be shown  @xcite that the staggered models correspond algebraically to solutions of the yang - baxter equations based on ` bigger ' irreducible representations of the quantum affine algebra @xmath37 .",
    "this occurs ultimately because finite - dimensional irreducible representations of quantum affine algebras are isomorphic to products of evaluation representations , which are themselves ` decorations ' ( with the spectral parameter ) of the usual spin-@xmath9 representations of @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "another important application of the staggered model is that it can be used to produce a lattice discretisation of a _ massive _ qft .",
    "this is done , following ref .",
    "@xcite , by introducing into the staggered model an additional ( purely imaginary ) staggering of the spectral parameters . using this approach",
    ", we obtain a scattering theory involving two types of massive particles , where the scattering between particles of the same type ( resp .",
    "different types ) is given by the sine - gordon @xmath38-matrix ( resp .",
    "the sine - gordon @xmath38-matrix with an imaginary shift in the rapidity ) .",
    "it turns out that such a scattering theory ( but with massless particles ) arose before  @xcite in the context of minimal models of cft perturbed by the @xmath39 operator . consider the action : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the action of a minimal model of cft .",
    "the problem of finding the thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) equations for the renormalisation - group flow of the theory   was first studied by zamolodchikov in ref .",
    "the results depend crucially on the sign of the coupling @xmath42 . for @xmath43 ,",
    "the model   becomes massive .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the corresponding @xmath38-matrix is the simple rsos @xmath38-matrix and that the tba diagram is of the @xmath44 type , with a massive particle at one end of the diagram . for @xmath45 ,",
    "the model   describes the massless flow between two consecutive minimal models . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a tba diagram was proposed , without resorting to an @xmath38-matrix : this diagram is also of the @xmath44 type , but with mass terms @xmath46 at the two ends of the diagram .",
    "it was found later , in ref .",
    "@xcite , that the corresponding scattering theory consists in massless left / right particles , interacting through the sg and shifted - sg @xmath38-matrices .    in summary",
    ", we construct here a non - critical lattice model whose continuum excitations are described by a massive version of the @xmath38-matrix for the flow between minimal models of cft .",
    "we also propose an effective qft for this model , with one boson and two majorana fermions which interact with each other .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "potts ] , we expose in more detail the construction of the model and its various lattice formulations , as well as the relation with spin chains and anyonic chains . in section",
    "[ sec : bethe - ansatz ] , we present the bethe - ansatz solution , and obtain the critical exponents , through the study of low - energy excitations . in section  [ sec : z - torus ] , we discuss the associated cft , and exhibit the full operator content through the study of torus partition functions .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : massive ] , we study the integrable massive deformation , and derive its scattering theory , tba equations and ground - state energy scaling function .",
    "this allows us to propose an interacting effective qft .",
    "some important but quite long calculations are done in the appendices .",
    "in this section , we first recall the definition of the potts model  @xcite on the square lattice and its equivalence to a loop model based on the temperley - lieb ( tl ) algebra  @xcite . then we introduce a solvable case , involving a staggering of the spectral parameters , and we obtain the expression   for the associated one - dimensional hamiltonian , in terms of the tl generators .",
    "this solvable model has two critical regimes : regime i corresponds to the antiferromagnetic critical transition  @xcite ; regime ii contains a mixture of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic couplings , and is the subject of the present paper .",
    "finally , we explain the relation to majumdar - ghosh spin chains  @xcite and anyonic chains  @xcite .      .",
    "each cluster configuration corresponds to precisely one loop configuration . ]",
    "the @xmath47-state potts model  @xcite is a model of classical spins with nearest - neighbour interactions .",

    "we may write the boltzmann weights as : @xmath51 = \\prod_{\\langle ij \\rangle } \\left [ 1 + v_{ij } \\delta(s_i , s_j ) \\right ] \\",

    "so the partition function can be written as : @xmath53 where the sum is over all possible subgraphs ( or cluster configurations ) @xmath54 , and @xmath55 is the number of connected components of @xmath54 .",
    "the fortuin - kasteleyn model is , in turn , transformed to a dense loop model . consider the lattice @xmath56 obtained by the union of the original square lattice and its dual .",
    "each face of @xmath56 contains exactly one potts bond . by decorating these faces as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fk - tl ] , we obtain configurations of closed loops on the lattice . the partition function is then : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the number of closed loops .    in the present study , we will restrict ourselves to the case when the couplings are @xmath59 on horizontal bonds and @xmath60 on vertical bonds .",
    "then , for the loops , a plaquette can be of two types , according to the direction of the potts bond it contains .",
    "the local boltzmann weights for the loop plaquettes can be written : @xmath61 where @xmath62 for plaquettes of type 1 and @xmath63 for plaquettes of type 2 .",
    "the non - local weights for closed loops are encoded in the temperley - lieb algebra  @xcite , with generators @xmath64 : @xmath65 these relations are interpreted graphically as follows : @xmath66 is the site index in the horizontal direction , and @xmath67 is the represented by the second term of eq .   at position @xmath66",

    "<S> new solvable vertex models can be easily obtained by staggering the spectral parameter in already known ones . this simple </S>",
    "<S> construction reveals some surprises : for appropriate values of the staggering , highly non - trivial continuum limits can be obtained . the simplest case of staggering with period two ( the @xmath0 case ) for the six - vertex model </S>",
    "<S> was shown to be related , in one regime of the spectral parameter , to the critical antiferromagnetic potts model on the square lattice , and has a non - compact continuum limit . here </S>",
    "<S> , we study the other regime : in the very anisotropic limit , it can be viewed as a zig - zag spin chain with spin anisotropy , or as an anyonic chain with a generic ( non - integer ) number of species . from the bethe - ansatz solution </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the central charge @xmath1 , the conformal spectrum , and the continuum partition function , corresponding to one free boson and two majorana fermions . finally , we obtain a massive integrable deformation of the model on the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , its scattering theory is a massive version of the one for the flow between minimal models . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding field theory is argued to be a complex version of the @xmath2 toda theory . </S>"
