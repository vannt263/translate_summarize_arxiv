    "in recent years , order versus disorder in substitutional semiconductor alloys has motivated several theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite studies .",
    "special emphasis is given to the understanding of the physical mechanisms behind observed deviations from random distributions in the atomic positions .",
    "the distribution of different species over the atomic sites in such compounds is largely responsible for variations in electronic properties such as the band gap , the density of states at the fermi energy and electron confinement levels .",
    "moreover , the atomic correlations in these systems are responsible for processes such as interface segregation and clustering , which are fundamental in defining the atomic scale structure and roughness of heterostructure interfaces .",
    "in particular , in@xmath0ga@xmath1as semiconductor alloys with @xmath5 have been the subject of experimental studies indicating deviations from randomicity in their atomic configurations @xcite .",
    "@xcite identified a strong correlation between in atoms in @xmath6 samples .",
    "clusters of 2  3 in atoms were reported to form preferentially along the [ 001 ] growth direction , in second - nearest - neighbor ( 2nn ) positions . chao _",
    "@xcite investigated @xmath7 samples and , in apparent contradiction with zheng s results , no strong correlations were found in for 2nn pairs along the growth direction , whereas important anti - correlation for first - nearest - neighbor ( 1nn ) pairs along [ 110 ] was reported @xcite .",
    "the absence of clustering of in atoms in @xmath8 quantum wires was also noted by pfister _",
    "chao and zheng emphasize that the mechanism behind the clustering / anticlustering effects in these alloys is the strain induced by in atoms , due to the @xmath9 mismatch between the gaas and inas lattice parameters .",
    "both studies @xcite were based on in@xmath0ga@xmath1as alloys grown using molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) on gaas ( 001 ) substrates at temperatures @xmath10 .",
    "the alloy samples were kept below the critical thickness on gaas substrate .",
    "cross - sectional images for cleaved @xmath11 @xcite and @xmath12 @xcite surfaces , obtained from scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) were used to determine the in distribution in the alloy .",
    "we follow here the orientation convention of pashley _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "the only apparent reason for the discrepancy concerning the second - neighbor clustering tendency in these experiments is the in concentration range : cluster formation was reported in @xmath6 samples @xcite , while no second - neighbor correlation was identified in samples with smaller values of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "we investigate this possibility presenting a theoretical study for in - in pair correlations within a keating model potential @xcite to describe the elastic interactions in the alloy .",
    "the monte carlo metropolis algorithm is used to determine the thermodynamic equilibrium configuration at finite temperatures .",
    "phase - diagram calculations predict that ingaas alloys are completely miscible at the growth temperature @xcite , but no detailed theoretical analysis of pair correlation functions has been found in the literature .",
    "therefore , one of the goals of the present work is to determine if the resulting in - in correlations are a consequence of bulk thermodynamics or if growth kinetics is important .",
    "our simulations are then performed within two models , according to the boundary conditions : a bulk model ( fully periodic ) and an epitaxial growth model ( periodic only in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 directions ) .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we define the pair correlation function , @xmath13 as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the probability of finding two in atoms at @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which , for homogeneous alloys , is only a function of the relative position @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the equivalent quantity calculated for a random alloy with the same composition . if @xmath20 we have correlation between the atoms that form the pair , and if @xmath21 we have anticorrelation .",
    "correlation indicates an effective attraction between the atoms , and anticorrelation implies a net repulsion .",
    "the keating potential provides a good description for elastic energies in iii - v semiconductor alloys @xcite .",
    "it is given by @xmath22 ^{2}+\\sum \\limits_{\\angle ijk}\\frac{3}{% 8d_{ij}d_{jk}}\\beta _ { ijk}\\left [ { \\bf r}_{ij}\\cdot { \\bf r}_{jk}+\\frac{% d_{ij}d_{jk}}{3}\\right ] ^{2},\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the equilibrium bond length between atoms @xmath24 and @xmath25 in the corresponding zincblend binary compound , @xmath26 is the relative position vector between nearest neighbors in different sublattices and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the bond - stretching and bond - bending constants , respectively .",
    "the elastic energy thus results from two contributions : the first summation ( performed over nearest - neighbor pairs ) refers to the excess energy due to the bond - length variations and the second term ( three - center term ) gives the contribution due to the deviations of bond angles from their ideal tetrahedral values .",
    "values for @xmath29 @xmath27 and @xmath30 were taken from ref .",
    "in particular , the difference between @xmath31  and @xmath32  leads to the structural mismatch in the system . for heterogeneous bond angles ,",
    "@xmath30 was taken as the geometric mean of the bond - bending constants for the binary compounds : @xmath33    calculations are carried out in supercells with @xmath34 conventional cubic unit cells of the fcc lattice along the @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 directions , respectively , resulting in a system with @xmath35 atoms .",
    "in@xmath0ga@xmath1as semiconductor alloys are modeled by supercells in which @xmath36 sites of the group - iii sublattice are occupied by in atoms and the remaining sites by ga , while the @xmath37 group - v sublattice sites are occupied by as atoms . for a given configuration ,",
    "the energy is minimized by relaxing all the atomic positions in the supercell .",
    "initially , we set the atoms to be randomly distributed , and evolution to thermodynamic equilibrium at the growth temperature ( @xmath38 k ) is carried out through the monte carlo metropolis algorithm , via first - neighbor in  @xmath39  ga positions exchanges .",
    "the calculations are performed at constant volume . in the bulk model ( section 3 )",
    "we use the vegard s law @xcite to give the approximated value for the lattice parameter and for the epitaxial growth model ( section 4 ) we keep the lattice parameter to the gaas value , aiming to describe a strained growth process .",
    "for the bulk model , after @xmath40 mc steps the system attains thermodynamic equilibrium and statistically independent ( @xmath41 mc steps apart ) alloy configurations are collected into an ensemble to calculate the pair correlation function .",
    "this procedure is repeated for 6 initial random alloy configurations , leading to analyzed ensembles of at least 100 configurations for each temperature and composition .",
    "the third column of table [ bulk ] shows our results for @xmath42 and @xmath43 in in@xmath0ga@xmath1as .",
    "notice an anticorrelation ( repulsion ) between 1nn pairs and a correlation ( attraction ) between 2nn pairs .",
    "these results are in qualitative agreement with experiments .",
    "however , quantitative agreement is poor : chao s @xcite experiments indicate a much stronger anticorrelation for 1nn pairs than what is predicted by bulk thermodynamics .",
    "in addition , the observed experimental discrepancy regarding the 2nn correlation can not be explained as a composition effect within the bulk model : there is no increase in the calculated correlation upon increasing in concentration from 5% to 20% .",
    "although not significantly larger than one , the 2nn correlation is clearly present .",
    "it is somewhat surprising that there can be such an effective attraction ( for 2nn pairs ) between in atoms based on elastic effects alone . since in atoms are larger than ga ones , one should expect that in impurities should compress the lattice locally and therefore repel each other . to see this in more detail , let s consider the interaction of two isolated in impurities in gaas .",
    "we define a pair interaction energy as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the keating energy for the supercell with two impurities and @xmath46 the elastic energy for a single impurity , calculated to be @xmath47 mev .",
    "the interaction energy is displayed in table [ tab ] .",
    "notice a net attraction ( negative energy ) along the [ 001 ] direction and a net repulsion ( positive energy ) along [ 110 ] , consistent with the mc results .",
    "the interaction energy is therefore highly anisotropic , as can also be visualized in figure [ energy ] .",
    "these results can in fact be explained by the intricate geometry of the zincblende structure , as we can see by considering the mean ga - as bond length deviations induced at nearby site by a single in impurity @xmath48 where @xmath24 is a ga site and the sum in @xmath25 is performed over the as sites nearest neighbors to @xmath24 .",
    "negative ( positive ) @xmath49 at a given site means that the lattice is locally compressed ( expanded ) at that site by the nearby in impurity , and therefore suggests that putting a second in impurity at that site will be energetically unfavorable ( favorable ) .",
    "one can see from table [ tab ] that even a larger impurity such as in in gaas can produce a local _ expansion _ of the zincblende structure along certain directions ( for instance , the [ 001 ] direction ) .",
    "an exact opposition between the signs of @xmath49 and @xmath50 can also be readily seen ion the table , thus supporting the argument given above .",
    "the highly anisotropic nature of the pair interactions is in agreement with first - principle calculations for these energies @xcite .",
    "interaction energies are determined there from a series expansion in terms of multiatom contributions , fitted to a set of ordered structures .",
    "their results are in qualitative agreement with the present keating model calculations , giving the most repulsive interactions between first and fourth neighbors [ ( 110 ) and ( 220 ) ] , while the less repulsive ones correspond to second and third neighbors [ ( 002 ) and ( 211 ) respectively ] .",
    "quantitatively , our results in table [ tab ] are lower than those in ref.@xcite by several mev and , in particular , no attractive pair interactions result from the first - principle fits .",
    "aiming at a more realistic model describing the experiments , we propose a simple description of epitaxial growth : _ ( i ) _ no periodic boundary conditions are imposed in the @xmath4 ( growth ) direction ; _ ( ii ) _ the first two ( bottom ) monolayers , with @xmath51 , represent the gaas substrate , and the atomic species are fixed as in bulk gaas .",
    "atomic positions are fixed according to gaas only in the @xmath52 plane ; _ ( iii ) _ growth in the @xmath4 direction proceeds by adding a single alloy monolayer at a time , until @xmath53 : the in  @xmath39  ga exchanges in the mc algorithm are restricted to the most recently grown monolayer ( free surface ) and the next monolayer is introduced only after thermal equilibrium has been attained .",
    "atomic correlations between successive monolayers are thus induced by the in distribution in the inner layers .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption since , at typical mbe growth rates , the time scales for atomic processes at the free surface are much shorter than those in the previously grown planes . in addition",
    ", as can be seen in table [ segreg ] , there is an elastic - induced attraction between in impurities and the surface . allowing bulk - surface in exchanges would produce in segregation at the growing surface , an effect that is known to occur but which we do not intend to describe here . in this present model",
    ", we do not treat dangling bonds , i.e. , the surface is described simply as a truncated semi - infinite solid .    in the fourth column of table [ bulk ] , we present the pair correlation function for 5% and 20% in concentrations in in@xmath0ga@xmath1as .",
    "there are now two inequivalent in - plane 1nn pairs directions , @xmath54 $ ] and @xmath55 $ ] . for the epitaxial growth model ,",
    "the configurational averages were performed over 20 different configurations for each concentration and temperature .",
    "the statistical ensemble in the epitaxial growth model is considerably smaller than for the bulk model , since each growth process here contributes with a single configuration to the ensemble .",
    "moreover , the bottom monolayers are fixed in composition to be of gaas , which decreases the total number of in pairs in each generated configuration .",
    "this leads correspondingly to larger statistical error bars .",
    "we note that for @xmath7 , @xmath56 along @xmath54 $ ] is significantly reduced with respect to the bulk model behavior ( see table [ bulk ] ) , while pairs along @xmath55 $ ] become essentially uncorrelated .",
    "this is an interesting feature of the epitaxial growth model : the free surface induces important anisotropy between the @xmath54 $ ] and @xmath55 $ ] directions , and the correlation function in the bulk is approximately the average between those calculated for the two inequivalent directions in the epitaxial growth model .",
    "the experimental results of ref.@xcite give @xmath57 along @xmath54 $ ] for @xmath7 and @xmath38 k. our corresponding values for the bulk and epitaxial models , @xmath58 and 0.56 respectively , indicate that epitaxial growth is a decisive ingredient in the observed experimental behavior .",
    "although the agreement is still not quantitative , our results confirm that the observed 1nn anti - correlation has an elastic origin . for 2nn pairs with @xmath6",
    ", we do not observe significant increase of the correlation function above the random value .",
    "however , the correlation enhancement in going from 5% to 20% seems to be present in the epitaxial growth model , although error bars are too large to allow a more precise statement .",
    "therefore , only elastic effects and a simple epitaxial growth do not provide a clear and quantitative explanation for the clusters formation reported in ref.@xcite , even though we detect a _ tendency _ for in - in attraction in the growth direction in many of the cases studied .",
    "perhaps a more sophisticated growth model , including aspects such as surface reconstruction and step - mediated growth , is necessary to better evaluate such results .                                        calculated ( bulk and epitaxial growth models ) and experimental correlation functions calculated for different in concentrations ( @xmath2 ) in the alloy and in - in relative positions ( * r * )",
