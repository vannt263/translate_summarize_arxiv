    "( ii ) _ an intermediate minkowski region , where resonances are described by regge trajectories and _ ( iii ) _ the strong interacting , low - energy region , described by chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath2pt ) @xcite .",
    "regge trajectories , _ i.e. _ a linear growth of the square of the resonance masses like @xmath3 gev@xmath4 for the vectors , were conjectured long ago , before qcd , and very well verified phenomenologically @xcite .",
    "this relation , thought to be valid in qcd for large number of colours , @xmath5 , has been proven by t hooft only in 2 dimensions @xcite .",
    "also other arguments have been proposed for the validity of regge theory aside from the experimental evidence : lattice , flux tube , confinement @xcite : we insist on these theoretical motivations of regge trajectories through this paper since we believe that qcd dynamics favours this physical picture .",
    "low energy qcd properties , like the chiral symmetry breaking ( @xmath2sb ) parameters , @xmath0 and the gasser - leutwyler coefficients @xmath6 s of the @xmath7 chiral lagrangian have been studied in the framework of holographic models of qcd , based on the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "several five dimensional set - ups have been proposed .",
    "the basic feature of hard - wall ( hw ) models is to simulate confinement by cutting drastically the extradimension of the ads@xmath8 in the ir , producing an infinite spectrum of kaluza - klein ( kk ) states to be identified with vector resonances of increasing masses .",
    "@xmath2sb in the axial sector is triggered either by a scalar field in the bulk @xcite or by appropriate boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "these models were actually anticipated by a deconstruction model @xcite . also the sakai - sugimoto model @xcite , a string set- up , shares this feature of an infinite spectrum of kk states . a recent review of all these models and their relation with the light - front holographic qcd approach is ref @xcite .",
    "all these models have a good description of the deep euclidean region ; for instance the correct two point function recover the partonic log , and a pretty well description of low energy qcd , obtaining the chiral parameters @xmath0 and the gasser - leutwyler coefficients @xmath6 s which are close to the physical values .",
    "in fact , it was observed that these hw models @xcite have the same two point vectorial green function as the one obtained by migdal long ago who proposed an _ ad hoc _ prescription to perform the analytic continuation of the perturbative deep euclidean qcd result to the minkowski region @xcite .    in order to reproduce resonances masses with a regge spacing",
    ", one can consider a 5d model with ads metric and an additional field , the dilaton @xcite .",
    "however , in this model it can be shown that the partonic log of the two point vectorial green function @xmath9 with the euclidean momentum @xmath10 , receives @xmath11-corrections differently from what holds in perturbative qcd operator product expansion ( ope ) used in the holographic models @xcite differs by a factor @xmath12 from the @xmath13 used in @xcite . ]",
    "nevertheless , we find extremely interesting to have a model where the regge region would be analytically related to the deep euclidean region even though with the wrong ope .",
    "this will be exactly our starting point : ope tells us the correct green functions in the deep euclidean in terms of gluon and quarks condensates .",
    "is it possible to modify the dilaton profile , @xmath14 , such to comply with qcd requirements in the intermediate ( regge ) region and uv ( ope ) region ? once this question has been answered in the affirmative , we are naturally led to add ress another important problem , that does not have a satisfying answer in this `` linear confinement '' holographic approach @xcite : how to implement the effects of chiral symmetry breaking into our model . if we look at the expansion of both vector - vector and axial - axial correlator @xmath15 for large euclidean momentum , qcd predicts @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we should then be able to take into account the difference appearing at order @xmath19 in the ope expansion of the vector and axial correlators .",
    "on the other hand , in the low and intermediate region in minkowskian momentum , chiral symmetry is broken at the level of the mass spectra of resonances , with the appearance of the pion as the corresponding pseudo - goldston boson of @xmath2sb .",
    "if we were able to deal with these aspects in a holographic model , we would have , in principle , closed the circle , since we would have a description of all three energy ranges of qcd .",
    "in fact , implementing the correct ope and mass spectrum for the axial sector , we will propose our post - diction of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( one of the the chiral @xmath20 coefficients ) in terms of our input parameters , _",
    "i.e. _ the regge spacing and the qcd condensates . our model , beside being a novel proposal for holographic qcd , links naturally to previous 4d qcd work where a phenomenological matching between low energy and ope was realised through regge theory ( or veneziano model ) @xcite .",
    "we have organized this paper in the following way . in section [ sec:1 ]",
    "we summarize the relevant properties of the existing soft wall model ( sw ) and focus on the vectorial two - point function .",

    "indeed , the corresponding eigenvalue equation for wave functions @xmath50 of the normalizable modes can be obtained from ( [ eq : eqmotionvector ] ) by requiring @xmath51 , which gives @xmath52 and the equation @xmath53 with the vanishing boundary conditions @xmath54 the authors of ref .",
