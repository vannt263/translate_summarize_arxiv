    "molybdenum oxide ( @xmath0 ) is a transition metal oxide showing extraordinary and versatile electrical , structural , chemical and optical properties , which depend on the oxidation state of mo , on the degree of crystallinity , on the sample morphology and on environmental conditions .",
    "this material system , particularly in the form of thin and ultra - thin films , finds applications in a variety of technologically relevant fields , including catalysis @xcite , gas sensors @xcite , optically switchable coatings @xcite , building - blocks for high - energy density solid - state microbatteries",
    "@xcite , smart windows technology @xcite , flexible supercapacitors @xcite , thin film transistors ( tfts ) @xcite and organic electronics @xcite . owing to its high work function  reported to reach 6.9 ev [ ]  and to the layered structure of @xmath1 , @xmath0 is currently also employed as a 2d material beyond graphene and as efficient hole contact on 2d transition metal dichalcogenides for _ p_-type field effect transistors ( _ p_-fets ) @xcite . in view of a reliable device performance ,",
    "the control over the chemical and physical properties of the @xmath0 system is mandatory .",
    "it has been recently reported @xcite that in @xmath0 with @xmath2 , oxygen vacancies originated from partially populated _ d_-states , give rise to occupied energy states within the forbidden gap  reported to be @xmath3 3.0 ev at room temperature @xcite  becoming bands above a critical concentration and driving the fermi level close to the conduction band .",
    "the oxygen vacancies concentration , and consequently the averaged oxidation state of mo , is a key parameter directly affecting the properties of the @xmath0 system .",
    "when fully oxidized , @xmath4 for @xmath5 with the corresponding formal oxidation state 6 + , @xmath0 is a standard closed _ _",
    "d__@xmath6 oxide , transparent and devoided of oxygen vacancies . in this case",
    ", there are no occupied states within the wide band gap and the material follows an insulating behaviour . by reducing the metal cations , that is , by increasing the amount of oxygen vacancies , @xmath5 forms a series of stable and metastable suboxides ( @xmath0 , @xmath7 ) , reported @xmath8 by magnli @xcite and kihlborg @xcite , showing semiconducting behaviour and a gradually increasing opacity . these sub - stoichiometric oxides",
    "present a complex x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) spectrum , resulting from the convolution of three different mo valence states , namely + 6 , + 5 and + 4 .",
    "moreover , @xmath9 , with formal oxidation state + 4 and with the 4__d__@xmath10 electron configuration , shows metallic conductivity and the highest opacity of the whole series . lately , the effects of air exposure on @xmath0 have attracted considerable attention @xcite .",
    "for instance , recent developments in the field of organic solar cells have shown the critical impact of air exposure on the electronic structure of the @xmath11 surface and , consequelty , on the device efficiency and lifetime @xcite .",
    "surface hydration or hydroxylation are suggested as possible mechanisms for reduction of cations in the @xmath0 system and , thus , for electronic structure changes . in particular , the hydroxylation mechanism is supported by recent density functional theory ( dft ) calculations @xcite .",
    "moreover , several reports from the field of organic electronics @xcite point at gap states formed not only by oxygen vacancies and cation reduction , but also by organic adsorbates at the interface between @xmath0 and the organic layers .",
    "process engineering for devices fabrication generally involves standardized steps in which thin layers are treated with various photo - resists and solvents , but systematic studies on the effects of processing on the properties of @xmath0 films are still wanted . in this work , we report on the effects of processing on the stability of ultra - thin @xmath0 layers treated with conventional photo - resist ( shipley s1818 ) and solvents .",
    "the in - depth study is carried out on a series of @xmath3 10 nm thick amorphous @xmath0 layers fabricated by means of reactive sputtering and presenting different stoichiometry , spanning  over the series  from a metallic to a fully oxidized phase and including , in particular , mo , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath5 .",
    "a combination of xps , angle resolved xps ( arxps ) and x - ray reflectivity ( xrr ) techniques is employed to determine the charge state of the cations , the valence band spectra and the structural arrangement of the samples as - grown and upon treatment / exposure .",
    "a list of the as - grown samples under study is provided in tableii of the appendix , while the labeling followed to identify the samples series according to the exposure / processing , is given in tablei .",

    "a basic two layered structure is defined , consisting of one alkaline earth boro - aluminosilicate substrate and the @xmath0 layer .",
    "the best fom is generally achieved by adding a second layer of @xmath0 , while keeping the total thickness constant and using the density of the two @xmath0 layers as parameter . in thist way a gradient of densities due to different oxidation states and/or chemisorbed impurities along the whole profile is simulated .",
