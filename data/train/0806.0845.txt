    "in recent years , it has been debated in the literature about possible alternatives to black holes , the black hole mimickers , which would look observationally almost like black holes but would have no horizon .",
    "the existence of such objects can , in principle , put in doubt astrophysical data which otherwise are considered as observational confirmation in favor of black holes @xcite . on one hand , it is clear that the properties in the near - horizon region where gravity is strong can be quite different for both type of objects . on the other hand , the statements about the difficulties in discerning black holes from their mimickers are usually related to measurements at spatial infinity .",
    "thus , one should insist on the question : can an observer at infinity catch the difference between both type of objects in some indirect way , or even rule out some possible mimicker ? in our view , the answer is positive and is connected with key properties , namely , regularity or singularity , of the corresponding geometries .",
    "it turns out that the requirement of full regularity up to an arbitrary neighborhood of the gravitational radius of the object enables one to rule out the potential mimickers in most of the cases .",
    "the goal of the present work is to examine the near - horizon properties , and their connection with far away asymptotic properties , of some candidates to black mimickers .",
    "we study spherically symmetric configurations , and make , two major divisions , or classes , on those candidates .",
    "first , uncharged or charged but non - extremal objects , and second extremal objects . within the uncharged or charged but non - extremal one can invoke as black hole mimickers , non - extremal @xmath0-wormholes on the threshold of the formation of an event horizon , some of which are called black foils @xcite ( see @xcite for the construction with other purposes of @xmath0-wormholes , which actually can also act as mimickers ) , and gravastars @xcite . within the extremal charged class one can invoke extremal @xmath2-wormholes on the threshold of the formation of an event horizon , quasi - black holes @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , and wormholes on the basis of quasi - black holes from bonnor stars , to name a few .",
    "we want to elucidate , whether or not the objects belonging to these two classes remain regular in the near - horizon limit .",
    "the arguments of @xcite which rule out non - extremal limiting configurations as becoming singular do not apply to the wormhole case @xcite . thus , we carry out the corresponding analysis anew for both classes of objects .",
    "for our purposes we write a generic spherically symmetric metric as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the radial coordinate , and the @xmath5 are generic parameters , that depend on each situation we are studying . for instance",
    "when treating wormholes one has @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , such that @xmath8 and @xmath9 . here",
    "@xmath10 is the radius of the would be horizon when @xmath11 is zero , @xmath12 is the radius of the other possible horizon , @xmath11 is in principle a small quantity , and @xmath13 is the radius of a possible matter shell , satisfying @xmath14 . in other situations , e.g. , for gravastars , one has @xmath15 and , possibly , the energy density and the pressure should be somehow included . for the metric ( [ 1 ] ) the components of the riemann tensor in an orthonormal frame , the hat frame , are equal to , @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 where a prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath4 . here",
    "these components of the riemann tensor have a simple physical meaning . the @xmath20 component in eq .",
    "( [ k(r ) ] ) yields the radial geodesic deviation , the @xmath21 component in eq .",
    "( [ n(r ) ] ) yields the angular deviation , and analogously for the @xmath22 and @xmath23 components in eqs .",
    "( [ f(r ) ] ) and ( [ h(r ) ] ) . in summary",
    ", they describe the deviation of geodesics in the corresponding directions . in general , forcing a matching at @xmath13 , with @xmath24 , surface stresses @xmath25 appear , which , in a coordinate frame , are equal to @xcite @xmath26 \\text { , }   \\label{00}\\ ] ] @xmath27 + \\left ( \\frac { d\\phi } { dl}\\right )",
    "_ { + } -\\left ( \\frac{d\\phi } { dl}\\right ) _ { -}\\ , ,   \\label{22}\\ ] ] @xmath28 being equal to @xmath29 , and @xmath30 being the proper radial distance .",
    "now , if metric ( [ 1 ] ) represents a wormhole , than the areal radius @xmath31 should have a local minimum at the throat .",
    "thus , we have two branches emerging out of the minimum radius , one with @xmath32 and the other with @xmath33 . then , @xmath34 @xmath35 there are also the bulk stress - energy components , but those do not interest us here and do not need computation .    in some situations one has to deal here with naked behavior .",
    "this means there are cases in which the kretschmann scalar and other curvature quantities are finite on the horizon in a static coordinate system , but some of those quantities may blow up in a freely falling frame . such a kind of behavior is called naked behavior , and many instances of it have been found @xcite . another example is with quasi - black holes @xcite .",
    "one of the features typical of quasi - black holes , consists in precisely showing naked behavior on and beyond the quasihorizon surface .",
    "in addition , metrics obtained by gluing two spacetimes , can have a similar behavior , but now the surface stresses , which are finite in a static coordinate frame , blow up in a free - falling frame .",
    "thus , since we have found in eqs .",
    "( [ k(r)])-([22 ] ) the curvature and surface stresses in a static frame for the spacetime in question , we now examine the behavior of the same quantities for a free - falling frame .",
    "consider then a radial local boost from a static frame with four - velocity @xmath36 to a free - falling frame with the velocity @xmath37 . under a boost",
    "the four - velocity transforms according to @xmath38 , where the orthonormal vector @xmath39 is pointing in the radial outward direction , and @xmath40 is the velocity boost parameter . in relation to the tidal forces in the bulk , the curvature components ( [ k(r)])-([n(r ) ] ) in the orthonormal basis responsible for tidal forces transform according to @xmath41 @xmath42 where a bar means a quantity evaluated in the freely falling frame , @xmath43 ( see equation ( [ h(r ) ] ) for the definition of @xmath44 ) , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is the energy of the particle frame ( see e.g. @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the most interesting situation arises when @xmath47 is finite ( so , the kretschmann scalar is also finite ) but @xmath48 diverges .",
    "the corresponding horizons can be called truly naked @xcite . in relation to the surface stresses , it is useful to define the quantity @xmath49 which represents the energy density of the shell as observed by the observer with the four - velocity @xmath50 . in a static frame @xmath51 .",
    "then , considering a boosted motion along a radial geodesic with energy @xmath46 , one obtains @xmath52 this is a useful expression for analyzing naked behavior of wormholes and other objects . for the wormhole case it reduces to @xmath53 where @xmath13 is the radius at which the shell is located , and we took into account eq .",
    "( [ s00 ] ) .",
    "there are many ways of making wormholes @xcite . in this section",
    "we are interested in making wormholes from charged metrics , more general than the reissner - nordstrm metric , but for certain choices the metrics can be reduced to the reissner - nordstrm metric . even for",
    "this metric one probably can think of many manners of making wormholes .",
    "we are interested in two different ways , that easily lead to the threshold of black hole formation , and the discussion of how they mimic black holes",
    ". then we compound both ways into one single way .",
    "the first way is the surgery approach , see ( see in particular section 15.2.1 of @xcite ) .",
    "pick up a spherically symmetric metric of the form @xmath55 , where @xmath10 is the radius of the would be horizon , @xmath12 is the radius of the other possible horizon , and @xmath13 is the radius of a possible matter shell , satisfying @xmath56 .",
    "take for instance the non - extremal reissner - nordstrm metric , where @xmath57 , with @xmath58 and @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 being the mass and electrical charge of the object , respectively , and @xmath62 is newton s constant ( we use @xmath63 ) . cut the metric at some @xmath13 and join the resulting spacetime with a symmetric branch .",
    "this is a non - extremal reissner - nordstrm surgery ( the schwarzschild surgery , with no charge and so @xmath64 , being a particular case of this ) , resulting in a non - extremal wormhole with a thin shell of matter at @xmath13 , the throat . in brief , one places at some radius , @xmath13 , a thin shell which separates two regions , with non - extremal geometries , with @xmath13 also defining the throat .",
    "then , one introduces another radial coordinate @xmath30 , such that @xmath65 with @xmath66 , and which covers the whole of the manifold , @xmath67 .",
    "the function @xmath68 is monotonically decreasing for the branch @xmath69 , which we call the @xmath70 branch , and monotonically increasing for @xmath71 , the + \" branch .",
    "in general , giving this construction , surface stresses @xmath25 appear .",
    "a second way , i.e. , another approach , to build wormholes , is through metrics of the type @xmath72 , where @xmath0 is a small quantity , @xmath73 is the radius of the would be horizon when @xmath0 is zero , and @xmath74 is the radius of the other possible horizon @xcite .",
    "metrics of this type , depending on the parameter @xmath0 , can be generically call @xmath0-spacetimes , which in special cases can become wormholes , i.e. , @xmath0-wormholes . in @xcite the model with metric @xmath75 , was considered , where thus @xmath76 , with @xmath77 being chosen appropriately . in turn , in @xcite the model with metric @xmath78 , was considered , where thus @xmath79 , with @xmath77 being chosen appropriately , and with @xmath80 being an additional parameter .",
    "thus , a generic @xmath0-metric of the type given above yields a generic spacetime that comprehends the two cited models , one model studied in @xcite , the other in @xcite .",
    "one can calculate the riemann tensor for the @xmath0-metric , and of course , since spacetime is not empty , there is a smooth energy - momentum tensor associated to the metric but we do not need to calculate it here .",
    "all these @xmath0-spacetimes are smooth .",
    "now , take the @xmath0-metric to construct a wormhole , i.e , an @xmath0-wormhole .",
    "since for the construction we need to impose some more conditions , in particular on the the potentials @xmath81 and @xmath77 of the @xmath0-metric , let us adopt the following approach .",
    "first , as above , one introduces the radial coordinate @xmath30 , such that @xmath65 and @xmath82 .",
    "the function @xmath68 is monotonically decreasing for the @xmath83 branch , @xmath69 , and monotonically increasing for the @xmath84 branch , @xmath71 .",
    "second , the dependence of the function @xmath81 on the parameter @xmath0 , @xmath85 , which can be of the type of the models considered above @xcite , is such that @xmath86 , and the dependence of the function @xmath77 on the parameter @xmath0 is also such that @xmath87 , so in the limit @xmath88 the original wormhole configuration indeed approaches a black hole .",
    "third , if the first derivative @xmath89 is continuous at the throat , we have @xmath90 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "when @xmath77 does not depend on @xmath0 at all , the throat is situated on the possible would be horizon .",
    "this is the approach used in @xcite to build a wormhole .",
    "this approach is smooth as long as @xmath91 . as a particular instance of this approach",
    ", one can choose @xmath77 as being reissner - nordstrm , @xmath92 , as usual .",
    "for @xmath93 one has a non - extremal choice for @xmath77 , the case @xmath94 , i.e. , @xmath95 , yielding the schwarzschild potential @xmath77 as a particular case , the one chosen in @xcite .",
    "such @xmath2-wormholes have been called foils in @xcite . when @xmath96 we have the full non - extremal reissner - nordstrm metric .",
    "so , let us compound both approaches , the surgery approach of @xcite , and the @xmath0 approach of @xcite .",
    "write then a generic @xmath2-metric with surgery as @xmath97 i.e. , from ( [ 1 ] ) one chooses @xmath98 where @xmath0 is a small quantity , @xmath10 is the radius of the would - be horizon ( if @xmath99 ) , and @xmath13 is the radius of a possible matter shell , satisfying @xmath56 .",
    "since we are studying here non - extremal metrics we have , when @xmath100 , that @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "essentially , what we have done is a surgery on @xmath11-metrics , non - extremal reissner - nordstrm ( with schwarzschild included ) metrics being particular @xmath100 instances .",
    "this can also be thought of as a one - parametric deformation of the original @xmath11-wormhole metric by gluing two branches at the throat @xmath13 , with @xmath24 .",
    "now , given the general @xmath11-metric with surgery , ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ epsilonwormpot ] ) , and the correspondent wormhole construction , we are interested in getting a spacetime that mimics a black hole .",
    "it is then not hard to understand that there are two distinct situations to obtain spacetimes on the threshold of being black holes .",
    "if there is no shell , then wormholes approach black holes when @xmath103 .",
    "if there is a shell but @xmath104 then the wormhole throat approaches the horizon when @xmath105 .",
    "therefore , there is a play of two small parameters @xmath11 and @xmath106 and the limiting procedure should be considered with great care .",
    "it gives rise to two distinct situations , depending on the order one takes the limiting procedures .",
    "situation bt : this situation is achieved by , in the end turning the wormhole metric into the metric of a black hole ( b ) ( i.e. , taking @xmath103 as the last operation ) , after first having moved the shell towards the minimum throat ( t ) radius ( i.e. , taking @xmath105 as the initial operation ) .",
    "formally , this means taking the limits in the following order @xmath107 .",
    "situation tb : this situation is achieved by , in the end the location of the shell approaches the throat ( t ) ( i.e. , taking @xmath105 as the last operation ) , after first turning the wormhole metric into a black hole ( b ) ( i.e. , taking @xmath103 as the initial operation ) .",
    "formally , this means taking the limits in the following order @xmath108 . note the case considered in @xcite for the metric ( [ 1 ] ) is a particular instance of the bt situation , since there @xmath109 always , and one only takes the @xmath103 limit .",
    "so the situation bt is the one that yields black foils , following the nomenclature of ds .",
    "one can calculate from equations ( [ n(r)])-([h(r ) ] ) that the components @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 of the riemann tensor are always finite , and from equation ( [ 00 ] ) that both limits when applied to @xmath110 give zero , i.e. , @xmath111 .",
    "but for the quantities @xmath47 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 ( see equations ( [ k(r ) ] ) , ( [ 22 ] ) and ( [ sigmacapital ] ) ) the situation may be different depending on the order one takes the limits .",
    "now , as we have been seeing , in treating this problem there are many levels of distinction .",
    "first , we can specify two models of @xmath0-metrics with surgery which depend on the parameter @xmath0 and @xmath13 , namely the model considered in @xcite , where @xmath114 , and @xmath77 is non - extremal , or some appropriate generalization of it , which we will call model 1 , and the model given in @xcite , where @xmath115 and @xmath77 non - extremal , or some appropriate generalization of it , which we will call model 2 .",
    "second , within each of the two cases provided by model 1 and model 2 , we should study the situations bt and tb .",
    "furthermore , as we want to examine the regularity of the system under discussion , the relevant quantities which we are going to calculate are the spacetime curvature components , and the surface stresses which appear on the glued boundary , i.e. , the shell .",
    "we will also study the naked behavior of each case .",
    "so , within each situation we have to study the behavior of the scalars , and in addition the naked behavior .",
    "thus we have eight distinct cases to analyze .",
    "we consider these eight cases , each in turn .      here",
    "we consider the one - parametric deformation , eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ epsilonwormpot ] ) , such that for @xmath99 our metric represents the gluing of two non - extremal black holes .",
    "note that in this non - extremal case the function @xmath77 of the metric ( [ 1 ] ) does not need to contain the parameter @xmath0 , so we put @xmath116 .",
    "model 1 _    let the metric have the form ( [ 1 ] ) together with ( [ epsilonwormpot ] ) .",
    "for model 1 choose the metric potentials as @xmath117 where @xmath118 can be any function that satisfies @xmath101 and @xmath119 .",
    "for instance @xmath77 can be reissner - nordstrm , @xmath120 with @xmath121 and @xmath59 , with the case @xmath64 being the schwarzschild case , the one chosen in @xcite .",
    "let us now work out generically the general behavior of this model , i.e. , how the curvature and stress - tensor quantities behave , and also work out generically the naked behavior .",
    "then we apply these behaviors to the two situations bt and tb . in doing so",
    ", we will display the properties of the quantities @xmath47 , @xmath122 , which characterize regular or singular general behavior , and the properties of the quantities @xmath48 , @xmath113 which characterize non - naked or naked behavior .",
    "as for understanding the general behavior note that , from equations ( [ k(r ) ] ) and ( [ 22 ] ) , explicit calculations give @xmath123 and @xmath124 in relation to naked behavior , note that since from ( [ n(r ) ] ) one has @xmath125 , and from ( [ h(r ) ] ) one has @xmath126 , one finds @xmath127 .",
    "thus , from ( [ barn ] ) @xmath128 \\ , .",
    "\\label{newbarn}\\ ] ] with this we can now study the situations bt and tb .    0.4 cm _",
    "situation bt : _ as for the general behavior , one has that for a non - extremal system @xmath101 and @xmath119 .",
    "then , it follows from equation ( [ e ] ) that @xmath129 and so , @xmath130 correspondingly , the kretschmann scalar @xmath131 also diverges .",
    "it was shown in @xcite for the choice @xmath132 that for @xmath133 there exist geodesics which have no analogue for the schwarzschild black hole metric .",
    "the timelike particles which move along them oscillate between turning points which are situated at different sides of the throat .",
    "however , the problem is that in the limit @xmath103 these geodesics pass through a region of a strong gravitational field .",
    "this gives rise to tidal forces in the radial direction which are of order @xmath134 .",
    "if @xmath135is exponentially small @xcite , the tidal forces are exponentially large .",
    "in addition , from equation ( [ 22e ] ) , it follows that @xmath136 now let us analyze the naked behavior .",
    "here one has , @xmath137 , @xmath138 .",
    "so , @xmath139 , @xmath140 .",
    "thus , there is infinite contraction in the longitudinal direction and infinite transversal stretching .",
    "moreover , since @xmath101 and @xmath141 , we obtain immediately from ( [ sigmacapital2 ] ) and ( [ efv ] ) that in the situation bt one has @xmath142    0.4 cm _",
    "situation tb : _ as for the general behavior , now one finds , @xmath143 .",
    "so , @xmath144 a result equal to that of a black hole .",
    "also , @xmath145 , so @xmath146 note that equation ( [ inf ] ) is in agreement with the behavior of surface stresses of a wormhole obtained by gluing two copies of the schwarzschild metric ( see equation 15.46 of @xcite ) .",
    "now let us analyze the naked behavior .",
    "one has , @xmath147 , so @xmath48 is finite and negative .",
    "thus , one obtains finite deformation in both directions .",
    "moreover , it also follows from ( [ sigmacapital ] ) that in the situation tb @xmath148 i.e. , @xmath113 diverges .",
    "thus , a free - falling observer encounters diverging surface energy density .",
    "the same conclusion applies to the flux @xmath149 .",
    "concluding here model 1 , we can say that there are two nonequivalent limits but each of them is bad \" in that in the bt situation the kretschmann scalar diverges , whereas in the tb situation it is the surface stresses that diverge .    0.5 cm 7.4 cm _",

    "thus , a free - falling observer encounters diverging surface energy density in the situation tb .",
    "the same conclusion applies to the flux @xmath170 .",
    "concluding here model 2 , we can say that in both situations , bt and tb , the curvature components remain finite but the limiting values of @xmath47 do not coincide .",
    "moreover , in both situations the surface stresses diverge .    0.5 cm    _ overall conclusions for models 1 and 2 _    0.1 cm    as an overall conclusion for the situation tb in models 1 and 2",
    ", we find the results agree for both models .",
    "this can be explained and generalized as follows . since ,",
    "in the situation tb , the limit @xmath88 is taken first , the dependence of the metric on @xmath0 drops out in the final expressions for the curvature and surface stresses , so any model gives the same result .",
    "in addition , assuming that for @xmath99 one has @xmath171 , and taking into account that @xmath101 and @xmath172 , we obtain immediately from ( [ sigmacapital2 ] ) that in the situation bt , @xmath164 , and in the situation tb , @xmath113 diverges .",
    "this holds independently of the kind of the model used .",
    "thus , a free - falling observer encounters diverging surface energy density in the situation tb .",
    "the same conclusion applies to the flux @xmath173 . in the non - extremal cases just studied , it turned out that each of the limits under discussion is singular : either the kretschmann scalar or surface stresses on the throat ( or both ) diverge .",
    "thus , the limit is singular . in other words ,",
    "a black hole mimicker made from a wormhole , and in particular a black hole foil , is not smooth .",
    "it is convenient to summarize the results in a table shown in figure [ table ] .",
    "3.7 cm    [ width=16.0 cm ] table.eps    0.5 cm      although the singular or almost singular behavior of these black hole mimickers based on @xmath0-wormholes casts doubts on their real existence , it is worth our while to study a little more on the effects of such mimickers on infalling sources and their detection by far away observers .",
    "intuitively it is clear that there should be some observational effects if infalling sources are distorted by stronger than normal tidal fields .",
    "first , we point out that indeed the fact that tidal forces grow unbound when @xmath103 , can be used , in principle , to distinguish a black hole from an @xmath0-wormhole which mimics it .",
    "suppose a small mass falling freely into a massive body , such as an @xmath0-wormhole .",
    "consider , for example , the situation bt .",
    "one can compare two approaches . in the first approach ,",
    "one neglects the size of the small mass and considers the geodesic along which such a point - like small mass moves @xcite . then",
    ", if the throat is very close to the would - be horizon and subsequent pulses are emitted near the throat , the intervals of time measured at infinity , grow unbound as @xmath174 in the limit @xmath175 .",
    "so an observer at infinity can not distinguish the fall of matter into a wormhole with vanishingly small @xmath11 from absorption of matter by a black hole , if the interval of observation time is less than @xmath176 , by construction a very long interval , see @xcite for details .",
    "in the second approach , however , one takes the finiteness of the size of the free - falling small mass into account .",
    "then , the overall picture changes since due to the growing tidal forces the small mass gets deformed .",
    "if the small mass is a luminescent source , such a change can in principle be detected by an observer at infinity .",
    "moreover , such changes happen much quicker than the typical times needed to penetrate the immediate vicinity of a horizon .",
    "the intervals of time during which the size of a small mass changes can be estimated from eq .",
    "( [ kinf ] ) and the geodesic deviation equation . for a process occurring near the throat it yields for the proper time the value @xmath177 , so that @xmath178 , as @xmath103 .",
    "the corresponding interval of time @xmath179 at infinity is @xmath180 is finite .",
    "therefore , in case of stretching , an observer at infinity would see an extended distorted image of an infalling small mass .",
    "if the tidal forces are infinite , as they can be in some of the cases shown above for @xmath0-wormholes , then the stretching is correspondingly large .",
    "of course , it is also possible that infinite contraction in some direction converts an extended small mass to zero size in this direction , see @xcite . for the usual black holes , tidal forces",
    "are also present but such forces are much weaker than for @xmath0-wormholes , where near the throat they can be as large as one likes for sufficiently small @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the key point is to look not to single geodesics as in @xcite , but to the separation between geodesics of the same congruence .",
    "such a separation delivers , to an observer at infinity , meaningful information about the region of strong gravity where a black hole or a @xmath0-wormhole can be situated , and such information has very different properties , which depend on the massive body in question .",
    "second , we indicate what further physical changes could be expected by performing some interesting estimates of the effects . here , one can take advantage of known results ( see @xcite , section 32.6 ) .",
    "suppose then that a box of small proper mass @xmath181 and proper length @xmath30 is freelly falling towards an object of mass @xmath60 .",

    "it is worth noting that this conclusion and its derivation is very close to the statement that quasi - black holes can not be non - extremal , if only finite surface stresses are allowed ( see sec .",

    "the only difference is that in the whole inner region @xmath207 everywhere for quasi - black holes whereas for gravastars @xmath208 can be non - zero there .",

    "we consider the one - parametric deformation ( [ 1 ] ) such that for @xmath99 our metric represents the gluing of two extremal reissner - nordstm black holes .",

    "a natural question arises : what happens if we start out our analysis with two extremal black hole spacetimes , i.e. , putting @xmath252 and @xmath253 , and the shell in - between the two spacetimes lies on the event horizon and so is lightlike ?",
    "more precisely , we are interested whether the stresses on the shell remain finite or become infinite",
    ". one can expect from our previous results that they are finite but this is not so obvious in advance .",
    "we have seen already that taking different limiting procedures in the near - horizon limit is a rather delicate issue .",
    "moreover , the formalism for lightlike shells @xcite somewhat differs from that for timelike ones , so we perform our analysis anew .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case of taking two extremal reissner - nordstrm black holes .",
    "the reason for this choice is that only extremal black holes are good candidates for gluing without severe singularities , i.e. , the gluing procedure maintains a finite kretschmann scalar throughout the spacetime as well as finite stresses on the glued surface .",
    "this case is also a majumdar - papapetrou case , and could be analyzed in the next section as well , but since it is also a limit of what has been done above , namely the null limit of a timelike wormhole throat with two extremal external vacuum spacetimes , we discuss it now . to match two extremal reissner - nordstrm spacetimes at the light - like surface @xmath253 we follow the general formalism for light - like shells @xcite .",
    "we write the metric in kruskal - type coordinates @xmath254 let the surface @xmath253 correspond , say , to @xmath255 . then , the effective energy density is @xmath256 , ( see , e.g. , equation ( 3.99 ) of @xcite ) .",
    "here @xmath257n^{\\alpha } $ ] , where the indexes @xmath84 and @xmath83 refer to the different sides of the shell , and the null vector @xmath258 is such that @xmath259 , with @xmath260 being a null tangent vector .",
    "now , the only nonvanishing components of @xmath261 and @xmath262 , are by construction @xmath263 and @xmath264 .",
    "since there is no rest frame in the null case , the measured energy density @xmath265 depends on the chosen observer . to check that it is finite and non - zero",
    ", it is sufficient to check that @xmath266 $ ] is finite and non - zero . for this purpose , it is sufficient to exploit the result of @xcite where it is shown that @xmath267 on the horizon . in our case , as we deal with two black holes instead of a single one , the coordinate @xmath4 increases on both sides of the shell .",
    "thus , @xmath268 has different signs and takes the values @xmath269 on each side .",
    "so indeed , the difference is equal to @xmath270 and is finite and non - zero . in general , there are other contributions to the effective stress - energy tensor of the shell due to effective pressures and currents , but it is easy to show that in our case they are absent .",
    "it is worth noting that the gluing in our case differs from the gluing between different extremal reissner - nordstrm black holes considered in @xcite , in that we replaced the usual metric inside the horizon by their @xmath83 branch .",
    "it also differs from the wormhole construction used in @xcite where two spheres were cut out from a vacuum majumdar - papapetrou system , or more precisely , they were cut from a single spacetime containing two extremal reissner - nordstrm black holes .",
    "0.3 cm    _ classical electron models _    0.1 cm    as a by - product of this light - like shell construction , and a very interesting one , we have just found a configuration that represents a regular wormhole configuration which is also a black hole .",
    "more important perhaps , in addition , it can serve as a classical model for an elementary particle in that ( i ) the system is characterized by a minimum number of fixed parameters like mass and charge and ( ii ) it is free of a central singularity inside .",
    "we are aware that it is not entirely of electromagnetic nature because it has stresses on the horizon , a kind of poincar stresses .",
    "but , anyway , such a surface stress , can be considered as a mild singularity when compared to the usual central singularity . in this model",
    "a free - falling observer can penetrate to the inside but , of course , can not return back to the original asymptotic region , due to the existence of a horizon .",
    "so the wormhole is an untraversable one .",
    "thus , the body under discussion combines features of an untraversable wormhole and a regular black hole , and can be called a worm - black hole . since the proper distant to the extremal horizon is infinite , such a hybrid construction is similar to the null wormholes , or n - wormholes for short , see @xcite .",
    "note that it differs from configurations representing quasi - black holes .",
    "for example , in some quasi - black hole models , see @xcite , there is a region @xmath271 which becomes degenerate in the quasihorizon limit .",
    "this region is missing in our worm - black hole model , since the black hole metric beyond the horizon is replaced by a branch with an areal radius that grows away from the horizon .",
    "it also differs from the model considered in @xcite where the external reissner - nordstrm part was glued to the bertotti - robinson metric that leads to surface stresses that vanish in the horizon limit in the static frame but grow unbound in the free - falling one , and as a result , the inner region becomes impenetrable for a free - falling observer ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "another candidate for the role of a black hole mimicker is a quasi - black hole . roughly speaking",
    ", it is an extremal object that appears when the system approaches the quasihorizon as nearly as one likes , along a family of quasi - static configuration .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that such a limit can correspond to an extremal quasihorizon only if we restrict ourselves to static configurations which are regular in the strong sense .",
    "the latter means that the kretschmann scalar should be finite everywhere in the system , and surface stresses at the quasihorizon should be finite as well .",
    "there are subtleties in the non - trivial relation between regular and singular features of quasi - black holes @xcite .",
    "for example , the whole region can look degenerate from the viewpoint of a distant observer and , nevertheless , the kretschmann scalar remains finite in that region .    in more detail",
    ", consider the static spherically symmetric metric ( [ 1 ] ) , and let it represent a spacetime in which there is an inner matter configuration , attached to an asymptotic flat exterior region .",
    "the @xmath5 in ( [ 1 ] ) stand for the radius @xmath13 of the configurations and possibly some other parameters connected with the particular object one is analyzing .",
    "for instance , the parameter @xmath0 also enters in the analysis , and here has a slightly altered meaning .",
    "it means a small deviation from a quasi - black hole , rather than from a black hole solution as in section [ nonextremalepsilonsurg ] , see also below .",
    "suppose the spacetime in question has the following properties : ( a ) the function @xmath118 in ( [ 1 ] ) attains a minimum at some @xmath272 , such that @xmath273 , with @xmath274 , this minimum being achieved either from both sides of @xmath275 or from @xmath276 alone , ( b ) for such a small but nonzero @xmath0 the configuration is regular everywhere with a nonvanishing metric function @xmath277 , at most the metric contains only delta - function like shells , and ( c ) in the limit @xmath278 the metric coefficient @xmath279 for all @xmath280 .",
    "these three features define a quasi - black hole . in turn , these three features imply that , there are infinite redshift whole regions when @xmath281 , a free - falling observer finds in his own frame infinitely large tidal forces in the whole inner region , showing thus naked behavior , although the curvature scalars are finite .",
    "moreover it has some form of degeneracy since , although the spacetime curvature invariants remain perfectly regular everywhere , in the limit , outer and inner regions become mutually impenetrable and disjoint . for a free - falling external nearby observer",
    "it is as if a null singular horizon is being formed . for external far away observers",
    "the spacetime may be said to be naively indistinguishable from that of extremal black holes .",
    "however , if one makes experiments with infalling luminescent extended small masses , one might find differences , since as discussed previously @xcite , due to the naked behavior , quasi - black holes enlarge grossly the tidal forces on an infalling small mass when compared to the tiny effect of an extremal black hole on the same small mass .",
    "thus , as with the extremal @xmath0-metrics studied before , the naked behavior shows that quasi - black holes are not so good mimickers , as was previously thought , but they are still better than black foils @xcite where the singularity is more severe .",
    "a further important property is that quasi - black holes must be extremal . for a quasi - black hole the metric",
    "is well defined and everywhere regular .",
    "however , when @xmath99 , quasi - black hole spacetimes become degenerate , almost singular , see @xcite .",
    "the quasi - black hole is on the verge of forming an event horizon , but it never forms one , instead , a quasihorizon appears . in summary quasi - black holes",
    "have normal general behavior and singular naked behavior .",
    "quasi - black holes may appear from bonnor stars , i.e. , systems composed of extremal charged dust and vacuum , from self - gravitating higgs magnetic monopole systems , and from composite spacetimes even in the case of pure electrovacuum , in which these vacuum systems are composed of an exterior reissner - nordstrm part glued to an inner bertotti - robinson spacetime or of an exterior reissner - nordstrm part glued to an an inner minkowski spacetime , see @xcite for a full discussion and references .",
    "bonnor stars are majumdar - papapetrou matter systems with either a sharp or smooth boundary to an exterior vacuum . since bonnor stars are paradigmatic to understand the formation of quasi - black holes ( see @xcite )",
    ", it is interesting to use those stars on the threshold of forming a quasi - black hole to understand whether wormholes on the basis of quasi - black holes which can be formed from bonnor stars , can mimic extremal black holes or not .",
    "this is an interesting variant , although with similarities , to wormholes on the basis of extremal @xmath0-metrics .",
    "we use bonnor stars , both in their compact version @xcite , as well as in their extended one @xcite .",
    "now , we start from the configuration which contains majumdar - papapetrou matter inside and vacuum outside , a compact bonnor star @xcite .",
    "let us have a compact object , a bonnor star , with extremal dust for @xmath282 , joined to an extremal reissner - nordstrm metric for @xmath283 .",
    "the potential @xmath284 can be written as @xmath285 with the mass density @xmath286 and the function @xmath287 being connected through @xmath288 .",
    "the function @xmath287 can be interpreted as the proper mass enclosed within a sphere of a radius @xmath4 .",
    "in addition , for extremal dust , one has @xmath289 , where @xmath290 is the electric charge within this sphere . at the boundary @xmath291",

    ", one can take the following procedure .",
    "cut the solution somewhere in the interior at some radius @xmath295 and discard the region @xmath296 .",
    "one obtains a majumdar - papapetrou matter region for @xmath297 , and a vacuum region for @xmath298 . for definiteness , let this spacetime be situated on the left .",
    "a symmetric right branch , also containing interior and exterior , is again cut at the radius @xmath299 , and glued to the symmetric left branch , producing thus a boundary shell at @xmath300 .",
    "then , it follows from the field equations that the left branch is given by @xmath301 \\,,\\quad r_{1}\\leq r\\leq r_{0}\\ , ,    \\notag \\\\",

    "therefore , in this limit , the matter between right and left boundaries becomes negligible and the construction corresponds to gluing two extremal reissner - nordstrm black holes in the situation tb of section [ nonextremalepsilonsurg ] .",
    "thus in the limit of our interest , @xmath304 , it is not surprising that the results coincide with ( [ 2bt1 ] ) and ( [ 2bt2 ] ) where @xmath305 .",
    "indeed , one finds @xmath306 and @xmath307 being finite as well .",

    "there is yet another procedure to produce a wormhole . in the above considerations",
    ", we performed a symmetric construction , in the sense that the @xmath84 and @xmath83 branches differed by the sign of @xmath89 only .",
    "now , we start again from a compact bonnor star configuration which contains matter inside and vacuum outside .",

    "however , one should not forget about some subtleties connected with the fact that singular behavior can , in general , manifest itself not only in the value of the kretschmann scalar . even if this scalar is finite , a naked behavior is possible or even inevitable as was shown in in the present paper and in @xcite ( see , e.g. , sec .",
    "v of @xcite for a discussion about other subtleties in which the singular features of quasi - black holes are revealed ) .",
    "there is also another candidate for the role of a non - extremal black hole mimicker , a gravastar @xcite .",
    "however , the corresponding surface stresses grow unbound when the radius approaches the gravitational radius , as we have seen .    from an astrophysical viewpoint , the situation bt in the non - extremal case ,",
    "i.e. , a black foil , is more interesting since it implies no necessity of making a shell by hand .",
    "it is the case considered in @xcite .",
    "one of the questions raised in @xcite is whether it is possible or not to distinguish between a true non - extremal black hole , a schwarzschild black hole say , and a wormhole .",
    "the main conclusion of @xcite is that it is impossible to distinguish for any finite time in the limit under discussion .",
    "this conclusion is reached on the basis of considering properties of bodies moving along separate fixed geodesics and emitting signals detected at infinity . however , if from single geodesics we shift our attention to a congruence of geodesics , it turns out that the strong gravity forces , on the near horizon region , leave their imprint on the form of a moving body and , thus , on the properties of signals which an observer at infinity is detecting .",
    "if the surface of the body is luminescent , an observer at infinity would see either a finite width instead of a point , a continuous detection instead of separate pulses , and so on .",
    "it is essential that in the case discussed in @xcite the corresponding proper time of deformation tends to zero when the curvature grows unbound , with the time at infinity being finite .",
    "thus , at least in principle , an observer can distinguish between a black hole and an almost singular wormhole .",
    "the singular nature of the limit in the non - extremal case makes also questionable the applicability of the membrane paradigm used in @xcite . the key point in this paradigm",
    "consists in boundary conditions according to which a free - falling observer sees a finite value of physical fields on the horizon ( see @xcite , sec .",
    "ii ) . however , in the problem under discussion , typically , this observer as well as the geometry itself become ill - defined . only in some cases ( see model 2 , situation tb ) the curvature components remain finite in the free - falling frame . but even in such situations the infinite surface stresses on the horizon surface makes the physical meaning of the membrane paradigm unclear since this paradigm relies heavily on the concept of a regular surface .",
    "objects based on nearly extremal wormholes , although of less interest astrophysically perhaps , have a much better behavior in the sense that both the geometry and surface stresses remain finite .",
    "moreover , typically , there is no naked behavior . in this case , the effect of strong curvature is much less pronounced than in the case of quasi - black holes where a naked behavior is typical @xcite . in this sense ,",
    "a wormhole composed on the basis of two extremal black holes seems to be the best mimicker of an extremal black hole .",
    "as by - product , we have obtained a model of a regular black hole !",
    "thus , if we try to arrange a ranking of black hole mimickers , both non - extremal and extremal , the list looks as follows from top to bottom : wormholes on the basis of extremal black holes or on the basis of quasi - black holes , quasi - black holes , wormholes on the basis of non - extremal black holes ( and within these the best are black foils ) , and gravastars .",
    "bearing in mind that in observational astrophysics it is difficult to find extremal configurations ( the would be best mimickers ) , whereas non - extremal configurations are really bad mimickers , the task of distinguishing black holes from their mimickers seems to be less difficult than one could think of it .",
    "in the present paper we have restricted ourselves to static spherically symmetric spacetimes .",
    "meanwhile , in a recent work @xcite the status of black hole mimickers is undermined in the rapidly rotating case as well since it is argued that they are unstable . we have also circumscribed our discussion to particular wormholes , gravastars and quasi - black holes @xcite-@xcite , since these objects are well adapted to our goal of examining the near - horizon properties and their connection with far away asymptotic properties . however , there are many other objects with properties that make them also potential black hole mimickers ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and which are worthy of study within our formalism .",
