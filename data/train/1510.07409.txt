    "the interaction of an antiproton with a nucleus is studied within the relativistic mean - field model @xcite . in this model , the interaction among ( anti)nucleons is mediated by the exchange of the scalar ( @xmath19 ) and vector ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) meson fields , and the massless photon field @xmath22 . in order to incorporate the @xmath0 into the model we extended the standard lagrangian density for nucleonic sector by the lagrangian density which describes the antiproton interaction with the nuclear medium : @xmath23{\\psi_j}\\\\ & + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\partial_\\mu{\\sigma } \\partial^\\mu { \\sigma } -m_\\sigma^2 { \\sigma}^2\\right ) - \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{1}{2 } { \\omega}_{\\mu \\nu } { \\omega}^{\\mu \\nu } - m_{\\omega}^2 { \\omega}^\\mu { \\omega}_\\mu ) \\\\ & - \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{1}{2 } { \\vec{r}}_{\\mu \\nu}\\cdot{\\vec{r}}^{\\mu \\nu } - m_\\rho^2{\\vec{\\rho}}_\\mu \\cdot{\\vec{\\rho}}^\\mu ) - \\frac{1}{4 } { f}_{\\mu \\nu } { f}^{\\mu\\nu } \\\\ & - \\frac{1}{3 } g_2 { \\sigma}^3 - \\frac{1}{4 } g_3 { \\sigma}^4 + \\frac{1}{4}d({\\omega}^\\mu { \\omega}_\\mu)^2~ , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 denotes the mass of the ( anti)nucleon ; @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 are the masses of the considered meson fields ; @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the ( anti)nucleon couplings to corresponding fields  @xmath32 and @xmath33 represent the strengths of the @xmath19 and @xmath34 field self - interactions .",
    "the field tensor fulfills @xmath35 , and correspondingly for the @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the equations of motion are derived using the variational principle employing the mean - field and no - sea approximations .",
    "furthermore , we are dealing with stationary states and spherically symmetric nuclei .",
    "we assume that single particle states do not mix isospin , i.  e. , only the neutral component of the isovector @xmath38-meson field is considered .",
    "the dirac equations for nucleons and antiproton then read : @xmath39\\psi_j^{\\alpha}=\\epsilon_j^{\\alpha } \\psi_j^{\\alpha } , \\quad j = n,\\bar{p}~,\\ ] ] where @xmath40 are the scalar and vector potentials and @xmath41 denotes single particle states .",

    "the coupled system of the equations of motion eq .   and",
    "eq .   is solved fully self - consistently by iterative procedure .",
    "the nucleon - meson coupling constants and meson masses were adopted from the nonlinear rmf model tm1 for heavy nuclei and tm2 for light nuclei @xcite .",
    "these two rmf parametrizations proved successful in the description of ground state characteristics of ordinary nuclei in the corresponding mass regions , however , it is not guaranteed that they will provide consistent account of the properties of @xmath0 nuclei ( e.g. @xmath0 and total binding energies ) , particularly their @xmath45 dependence .",
    "moreover , since tm1 and tm2 yield quite different compressibilities of nuclear matter , they could predict different size of the nuclear core modifications due to the antiproton .",
    "we thus performed calculations of selected @xmath0 nuclei using the rmf nl - sh parametrization @xcite as well , and studied model dependence of our results .",
    "the antiproton placed in a nucleus causes strong polarization effects resulting in the high central density of the nuclear core , reaching up to 4 times the nuclear matter density .",
    "the application of standard rmf models for the description of nuclear matter at such densities has to be considered as extrapolation .",

    "the equations of motion in the rmf model are derived on the hartree level where each nucleon moves in mean fields created by _ all _ nucleons bound in the nucleus .",
    "consequently , the nucleon feels in addition a kind of `` attraction '' as well as `` repulsion '' from itself . in ordinary nuclei",
    "this self - interaction has only a minor ( 1/a ) effect .",
    "however , the potential acting on the antiproton in a nucleus is much deeper than the potential acting on nucleons and so the impact of the @xmath0 self - interaction could become pronounced . in order to explore the role of the @xmath0 self - interaction , we performed calculations where the @xmath0 source terms were omitted in the klein - gordon equations for the boson fields acting on the antiproton , i.e. @xmath58 and compared them with the results of regular calculations according to eq .  .",
    "the impact of the unphysical @xmath0 self - interaction depends on the depth of the @xmath0 potential .",
    "the deeper is the @xmath0 potential the larger is the role of the @xmath0 self - interaction .",
    "we will demonstrate in the following section that the effect of the @xmath0 self - interaction is negligible for the @xmath0 potential consistent with available experimental data .      on the level of hadron degrees of freedom the strong interaction between nucleons",
    "is understood as a meson exchange process .",
    "when going from the @xmath4 interaction to @xmath5 interaction the g - parity transformation , which consist of charge conjugation and rotation in isospin space , seems to be a natural link for the medium and long range part of the interaction which is governed by the meson exchange . to describe the @xmath0-nucleus interaction we thus make use of the g - parity transformation .",

    "we should stress that g - parity is surely a valid concept for the long and medium range @xmath0 potential .",
    "however , the @xmath0 annihilation plays a crucial role in the @xmath3 and @xmath0-nucleus interactions .",
    "it has a major contribution in the short range region and it is not clear to what extent it affects the elastic part of the interaction .",
    "moreover , various many - body effects could cause deviations from the g - parity values in the nuclear medium as well @xcite .",
    "therefore g - parity should be regarded as a mere starting point to determine the @xmath0-meson coupling constants in standard rmf models .",
    "it is to be noted that a recent approach @xcite which incorporates the momentum dependence of the mean fields yields the @xmath0 potential consistent with in - medium antinucleon phenomenology while retaining the g - parity symmetry .",

    "it is to be stressed here that due to sizable modifications of the nuclear core caused by the deeply bound antiproton , the dynamically evaluated @xmath0 potential becomes considerably deeper than the corresponding potential deduced from the analysis of @xmath0 atoms , as will be demonstrated in section 4 .",
    "the annihilation of the antiproton in the nuclear medium is an inseparable part of any realistic description of the @xmath0-nucleus interaction .",
