    "studies of the stellar populations of massive galaxies suggest that they form the bulk of their stars at early epochs ( @xmath0@xmath162 ) , with the more massive galaxies building up their stellar component at earlier epochs and on shorter timescales ( see review by renzini @xcite ) .",
    "these findings suggest the existence of a population of massive , gas - rich starburst galaxies at early cosmic times  properties which are consistent with those of smgs .",
    "smgs are typically intense ( @xmath17500yr@xmath15 ) , optically obscured , relatively short - lived ( @xmath18100myr ) starbursts at high redshift , implying rapid gas consumption timescales at high star formation efficiencies ( e.g. , smail et al .",

    "most smgs have sizes of a few kpc and are dynamically complex , exhibiting the properties of gas - rich , major mergers ( e.g. , tacconi et al.@xcite ) .",
    "the physical properties of the star - forming material in these extreme galaxies are best studied using rotational emission lines of molecular gas tracers , most commonly co. molecular gas is the fuel for star formation , and has been detected in @xmath1630 smgs to date .",
    "these typically have large gas reservoirs of @xmath1610@xmath12  ( see review by solomon & vanden bout @xcite ) .",
    "the difficulty of such studies is reflected in the moderate number of detections and limited level of detail of most experiments .",
    "a promising way to overcome these limitations is to study strongly gravitationally lensed smgs , as lensing provides a boost in sensitivity and spatial resolution .",

    "<S> the gas mass , gas mass fraction , gas depletion timescale , star formation efficiency , and specific star formation rate are typical for an smg . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity structure of the gas reservoir suggests that the brightest two lensed images are dynamically resolved projections of the same dust - obscured region in the galaxy that are kinematically offset from the unresolved fainter images . </S>",
    "<S> the resolved kinematics appear consistent with the complex velocity structure observed in major , ` wet ' ( i.e. , gas - rich ) mergers . </S>",
    "<S> major mergers are commonly observed in smgs , and are likely to be responsible for fueling their intense starbursts at high gas consumption rates . </S>",
    "<S> this study demonstrates the level of detail to which galaxies in the early universe can be studied by utilizing the increase in effective spatial resolution and sensitivity provided by gravitational lensing . </S>"
