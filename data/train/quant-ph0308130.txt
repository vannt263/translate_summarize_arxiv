    "a sat problem , associated with the combinatorial search problem@xcite , is well known as one of the most difficult _ nondeterministic polynomial _ ( np ) problems . as the first problem to be shown np - complete@xcite ,",
    "the sat problem is a central problem in combinatorial optimization . on conventional computers ,",
    "one expects that no efficient algorithm to solve random sat problem in polynomial time can be found , whereas quantum computers can simultaneously evaluate all search states ( _ quantum parallelism _ ) which endows quantum computation with the extraordinary capabilities superior to its conventional counterpart . as a result , of pratical interest",
    "is whether the computational resources for np problems can be reduced on quantum computers .",
    "the most striking results so far were obtained for certain np and some difficulty problems@xcite . for instance , hogg@xcite put forward a highly structured quantum algorithm to solve a 1-sat and maximally constrained @xmath0-sat problem in a single step with probability 100% on a ground state input @xmath1 which have been experimentally implemented in nmr ensemble quantum computing@xcite .    in standard quantum computation ,",
    "quantum computers are machines that operate and control pure quantum states according to quantum mechanics . in turn , the proposals of nmr ensemble quantum computing@xcite involve manipulations of highly mixed states , i.e. , pseudo - pure states , and has achieved rapid devolopment in recent years . at the beginning of the proposals , it has been proved that an expectation value quantum computer ( evqc ) ( e.g. , a nmr quantum computer ) is capable of solving np - complete problems in polynomial time , such as the sat problems@xcite .",
    "such an evqc can not only judge if the sat formula is satisfiable but also count the number of satisfying assignments .",
    "furthermore , in 1998 , knill et al .",
    "@xciteproposed the `` one - qubit '' model of quantum computation where the initial state is a truly mixed state , i.e. , the first qubit is 0 and the other qubits are completely random , and described the power of this model . in the same year , madi et al.@xcite presented a parallelization scheme for quantum computation with mixed superposition states by using the operators in spin liouville space , which has been utilized to solve certain sat problems when only the existence of a solution is considered .    in this paper , a general method",
    "is given to construct quantum circuits for random sat problems with c@xmath2-not and not gates .",
    "the size of the circuit is evaluated to be approximately the size of the given sat formula .",
    "analogous to the `` one - qubit '' model of quantum computation , we present a parallelization scheme of solving random sat problems through these constructed circuit with a truly mixed state .",
    "the information contained in the line - splittings is used to extract the explicit knowledge of satisfying assignments from inspection of multiplet of just one qubit . in principle , hence , a np - complete sat problem is solved in polynomial time on a nmr quantum information processor which invokes _",
    "quantum parallelism_. meanwhile , we have experimentally implemented several typical sat problems on a 3- or 4-qubit nmr quantum information processor by this scheme .",
    "these experiments exclude the extreme difficulty of the pseudo - pure state preparation because truly mixed superposition states for parallelizaion acts as inputs instead of pure states . in practice",
    ", this analogous parallelization scheme can be applied to other problems of intrest@xcite .",
    "a sat problem@xcite is described in terms of a logic formula @xmath3 in conjunctive normal form ( cnf ) , consisting of @xmath4 logical clauses @xmath5 over a set of @xmath6 boolean variables @xmath7 with @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "each clause is the logic or connection ( @xmath10 ) of some chosen variables or their negations , e.g. , @xmath11 .",
    "the logic formula @xmath3 can be expressed as the logical and connection ( @xmath12 ) of all clauses , i.e. , @xmath13 a solution to the sat problem is an assignment @xmath14 by specifying a value for each variable @xmath15 , satisfying the formula @xmath3 , that is , @xmath16 .",
    "an important restricted case of sat is @xmath0-sat@xmath17when all the clauses have exactly @xmath0 variables , which is np - complete for @xmath18@xcite .",
    "an example of the 3-sat problem with three variables ( @xmath19)and three clauses ( @xmath20 ) is the propositional formula @xmath21 .",
    "this problem has five solutions , e.g. , @xmath22 , an assignment with the bit representation 110 .",
    "the study of random @xmath0-sat problems for @xmath18 has played a major role in both classical and quantum computational sciences .    from the achievements of quantum computing ,",
    "it is possible to convert the boolean operations into a sequence of unitary transformations by designing a resultant _ reversible _ gate @xmath23 where the input @xmath24 is the control registe and a work one - bit @xmath25 whose initial state @xmath26 is the target qubit to store the computational output of the formula @xmath3 . here",
    ", variable @xmath15 is viewed as the @xmath27-th bit @xmath28 whose state is represented by @xmath29 which can be equal to either @xmath30 or @xmath31 .",
    "@xcite gives a practical method of constructing quantum boolean circuits ( qbc ) for boolean functions by using not and general multi - bit controlled - not gates .",
    "the toffoli gate has been shown to a well - known _",
    "reversible _ gate sufficient to implement all boolean functions@xcite .",
    "for example , the operation of ( @xmath32 ) is performed by a toffoli gate ( see figure 1(a ) ) , while an alternative , simple performance of ( @xmath33 ) is to combine a toffoli gate with not gates ( see figure 1(b ) ) because the not gate is itself reversible .    therefore , the @xmath34 gate for the cnf formula @xmath3 of eq .",
    "( 1 ) can be easily constructed with qbcs . due to the or connection of some variables in each clause , the unitary transformation to compute every clause",
    "is realized by one generalized multi - bit controlled - not gate @xmath35 sandwiched by not gates as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a set of the control bits which includes the @xmath27-th bit iff variable @xmath15 or @xmath38 appears in the clause @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the target bit whose state @xmath41 is initialized into @xmath42 as an additional scratchpad to store the value of the clause @xmath39 , and @xmath43 represents the not gate on the _",
    "i-_th bit . the first pair of @xmath44 on the bits @xmath45 are used to realize the @xmath46 operations in the clause @xmath39 with the second @xmath47 on the bits @xmath28 are the requirement of the or operation in the clause in the light of figure 1 ( b ) . in general , @xmath48 additional qubits",
    "@xmath49 are required .",
    "the @xmath34 gate to realize the sat formula @xmath3 is obtained by multiplying all clause gate @xmath50 followed by one @xmath51 gate to perform the and operation of all @xmath4 clauses , i.e. ,    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is a set of all scratchpad bits @xmath54 storing the results of @xmath4 clauses , respectively , as the control bits and the value of the cnf formula @xmath3 is given through the work bit @xmath25 whose initial state @xmath55 is set to @xmath56 .",
    "thus a sat problem can be simulated by cnot - based circuits .",
    "for example , the qbc to simulate a 3-sat mentioned above is shown in figure 2 ( a ) .",
    "usually , this @xmath34 gate in eq .",
    "( 4 ) originally generated by this construction can be further simplified to get the most effecient circuit by some logic rules@xcite .    in the circuit model of computation , the number of elementary gates of a circuit and the number of time steps required are often checked to evaluate the size of the circuit so as to determine its complexity .",
    "we first concetrate on the @xmath0-sat problem because of its importance .    for the simplest case of 1-sat problems , the gate sequence to simulate a given 1-sat formula @xmath57 with @xmath4 clauses can be simplified as @xmath58 which requires one c@xmath59-not gate and several not gates .",
    "llikewise for @xmath0-sat  problems with one clause @xmath60 , @xmath61 which requires one c@xmath62-not gate and several not gates .",
    "since it is proved that the two - qubit c - not gate and single - qubit gates consist of a set of univeral quantum logic gates , we use them to investigate the size of these circuits .",
    "iterating the construction of c@xmath59-not from c@xmath63-not@xcite , the overall @xmath64 gates including @xmath65 c - not and @xmath66 single - qubit gates are needed to obtain a c@xmath59-not gate . accordingly , plusing at most @xmath67 not gates , the overall circuit complexity is @xmath68 .",
    "similarly , the quantum circuit for a @xmath0-sat problem with one clause needs only @xmath69 gates . in these two cases of sat ,",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath48 are of the same order @xmath70 so that these qbcs can simulate such a sat problem with the polynomial computational cost in a single run .    according to the circuit configuration of eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , the qbc for random @xmath0-sat problem with @xmath4 clauses ( @xmath71 ) requires @xmath4 c@xmath62-not , one c@xmath59-not and at most @xmath72 not gates , so that its size of @xmath73 is almost equal to the size of the @xmath0-sat formula .",
    "for instance , a np - complete 3-sat needs @xmath74 c - not , @xmath75 single - bit and at most @xmath76 not gates .",
    "however , such a qbc has to involve @xmath4 additional qubits as the scratchpads which would waste vast space and increase the difficulty of this procedure .",
    "economizing on space is also an important aspect to investigate the efficiency of the circuit . the simplification by the logic rules@xcite might reduce the complexity of the qbc and optimize its space at some extent .",
    "it is also possible to decrease the number of scratch - pad qubits by the `` refreshed '' scheme@xcite .",
    "concretely , we can divide the computation into smaller steps of roughly equal size , run each step , copy the output , then run this step backward to clear up the scratch - pad qubits which can be used in the next steps due to the _ reversibility _ of quantum circuit@xcite .",
    "the requirement of the step division is to remain the input unchanged before and after each step , which can easily satisfied in our qbc construction .",
    "so the computation can proceed to completion by constructing a ` recursive ' procedure to generate the minimal amount of scratch - pad bits .",
    "further , random sat problems are analogous to random @xmath0-sat problems and their circuit sizes are less than the corresponding @xmath77-sat where @xmath77 is the maximal number of variables in clauses",
    ".    therefore , random sat problems can be simulated by quantum circuits .",
    "using qubits instead of bits , we give a paralleization scheme for solving random sat problems through these qbcs with truly mixed states as the inputs other than pseudo - pure states in a nmr quantum processor .      in nmr quantum computing , _",
    "spin-@xmath78 nuclei are chosen as computational qubits @xmath79,@xmath80 ... ,@xmath81 representing _ n _ variables in the sat problems , one as the work qubit @xmath25 and some additional qubits as scratchpad qubits @xmath40 if needed . just as the general computation",
    ", our scheme is divided into three steps : ( 1 ) the preparation of the initial state ; ( 2 ) the process of computation ; and ( 3 ) the measurement of the computational results .",
    "we prepare the nmr ensemble into a mixed superposition state @xmath82 of @xmath83 equally populated states @xmath84 multiplied by @xmath85 : @xmath86 if the qbc for a given sat problem involves _",
    "scratchpad qubits @xmath54 . here , we adopt the convenient representation of the @xmath27-th spin polarization operators in liouville spin space@xcite : @xmath87 which represent the spin - up and spin - down states , respecitvely , where @xmath88 is a @xmath89 unit matrix and @xmath90 is the z component of pauli operators of the @xmath27-th spin .",
    "note that the work qubit @xmath25 and all scratchpad qubits @xmath40 are in the @xmath42 state and all computational qubits @xmath28 are random states includes all @xmath83 assignments of _ n _ variables , neither pure nor pseudo - pure states . when no scratchpad qubits are involved in the circuit constructed , such as the 1-sat and",
    "_ k_-sat with one clause , the `` one - qubit '' model of quantum computation proposed by knill et al .",
    "is obtained@xcite .",
    "step 2 . the @xmath34 gate for the qbc constructed above",
    "is carried out on such an input state @xmath91 of eq .",
    "( 8) which is transformed to the output state @xmath92 :    @xmath93    becuase of the and operation between clauses , the values of all clauses @xmath94 stored in the states of _ m _ scratchpad qubits @xmath54 have to be equal to 1 in order to satisfy the formula @xmath3 . it can be seen from eq .",
    "( 9 ) that , the solutions of the sat formula @xmath3 , i.e. , those states @xmath95 , are labelled by the state of the work qubit @xmath25 @xmath96 . to see the proper performance of these qbcs ,",
    "let me see a simple 1-sat with the formula @xmath97 , through @xmath34 consisting of a c@xmath98-not gate and two not gates with no scratchpad qubits , @xmath99 which demonstrates that the solution of the 1-sat is @xmath100 .",
    "the last step of computation is to extract efficiently the results of computation stored in the work qubit @xmath25 .",
    "quantum strong measurement prohibits such a successful process .",
    "however , in some special cases , ensemble weak measurements ever considered as disadvantages in nmr quantum computing can be advantageous . according to the spectral implementation of a quantum computer@xcite ,",
    "2@xmath2 logic states of _ n _ computational qubits are assigned to individual spectral resonance lines of the work qubit @xmath25 when all resonance lines are distinguishable .",
    "moreover , it can be recoginized@xcite from eq . ( 9 ) that after a @xmath101 detection pulse on spin @xmath25 the @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) state gives a positive absorptive peak in a nmr spectrum with properly set reciever phase settings , while the @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) state gives a negative peak . as a result , we label the positive domain as the _ false _ space and the negative _ true _ space . all scratchpad qubits",
    "@xmath40 should be decoupled during the measurement because the solutions are irrelevant to these qubits .",
    "the result is put into evidence by the sign of the resonance of spin @xmath25 , i.e. , the solutions of a sat problem corresponding to the positive resonance lines of spin @xmath25 after a @xmath101 detection pulse should be found in the _ true _ space if there exists the solution .",
    "it is , of course , necessary to obtain a reference signal against which the phases of other signals of interst can be determined , but this is easily achieved by acquiring a nmr signal from thermal equilibrium @xmath106 of spin @xmath25 .",
    "the physical system used in our experiments is the carbon-13 labeled alanine @xmath107 dissolved in @xmath108 .",
    "all experiments were performed on a varian inova500 spectrometer with a probe tuned at 500.122mhz for @xmath109h and at 125.768mhz for @xmath110c .",
    "the measured nmr parameters are listed in table 1 .",
    "three @xmath111c nuclear spins of 99% abundance were chosen as a 3-qubit system with decoupling all protons , while three @xmath110c and one @xmath109h nuclear spins as a 4-qubit system with decoupling the methyl protons . in both of the two separate systems ,",
    "spin c@xmath112 was chosen as the work qubit @xmath25 due to its well - resolved scalar @xmath113 couplings to all other spins .",
    "spins c@xmath114 , c@xmath115 and @xmath109h being directly joined with c@xmath116 , representing qubits @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath117 .",
    "their reference spectra of thermal equilibrium are shown in figure 3 .",
    "the key of sucessful experiments is how to implement effeciently the c@xmath2-not gates which are elementary operations in these qbcs for sat problems .",
    "the c@xmath2-not gate can be implemented in many ways . in all experiments ,",
    "the c - not gate was accomplished via the appropriate rotation and delay with selective refocusing schemes@xcite , while the c@xmath2-not gate when @xmath118 by a single low - power transition - selective pulse@xcite which are very efficient and reliable on our parallelization scheme becuase the input state remains always along z axis when applying these transition - selective pulses@xcite . in all experiments ,",
    "we employed a low - power _ gaussian _ pulse of length 80@xmath119 to selectively excite an individual transition . a technique was used to realize a c@xmath59-not gate in a more - qubit ( @xmath120 ) system , i.e. , decoupling the irrelevant qubits only when applying the line - selective pulse .",
    "for example , to implement the c@xmath121-not gate with spins c@xmath122 and c@xmath115 as the control qubits and spin @xmath25 as the target qubit in a 4-qubit system , we first decoupled spin @xmath109h , then realized the c@xmath121-not gate just like that in a 3-qubit system and finally recoupled spin @xmath109h",
    ".    begin with some simple speical cases of modified sat problems such as @xmath123 and @xmath124 . as the and or or  operation connects the same variable or their negation , a scratchpad qubit @xmath80 is introduced in the circuit to store their values by a c - not gate .",
    "then the scheme described in sec .",
    "ii was performed .",
    "first the mixed state @xmath125 was prepared from thermal equilibrium by this following pulse sequence : @xmath126 where @xmath127 and @xmath128 denote @xmath129 and @xmath130 rotations about @xmath131 axis on spin @xmath27 and so forth , @xmath132 describes a time evolution of @xmath133 under the scalar coupling between spins @xmath25 and @xmath80 with the selective refocusing @xmath134 pulses @xmath135 and @xmath136@xcite and @xmath137 represents a pulsed - field gradient ( pfg ) along z - axis .",
    "the experimental results are shown in figure 4 , ( a ) and ( c ) for the number of variables @xmath138 ( on the left column ) on the 3-qubit homonuclear system ; ( b ) and ( d ) for @xmath139 ( on the right column ) on the 4-qubit system with qubit @xmath117 as the variable @xmath140 . due to the experimental limitation",
    ", we artificially subtract the information related to spin @xmath80 by removing its relevant resonance lines .",
    "there is no corresponding resonance lines in the _ true _ space for the case of @xmath141 ( see figure 4 ( a ) and ( b ) ) , indicating that no solutions exists in the problem of @xmath142(i.e . , @xmath143 ) ,",
    "but for @xmath144 ( see figure 4(c ) and ( d ) ) , all resonance lines appear in the _ true _ space , indicating that the logic expression @xmath145 .",
    "furthermore , we also experimentally tested other two cases : @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "as shown in figure 4 ( e)-(h ) , the resonance lines related to the solutions are separated from the _ false _ space , appearing in the _ true _ space , which are in good agreement with the theoretical expectations . in the same way , we can test these simple formulas on a larger number of variables ( @xmath148 ) , i.e. , to search assignments satisfying these formulas in a larger database .",
    "in addition , all the logic formulas of 1-sat of two and three variables , and the @xmath0-sat with one clause were experimentally implemented on such a 3-qubit or 4-qubit nmr quantum processor .",
    "qubits @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath117 are viewed as the variables @xmath149 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 , respectively .",
    "the initial input state @xmath102 from thermal equilibrium was more easily prepared by applying radio - frequency ( rf ) @xmath101 pulses on all other qubits except for @xmath25 , followed by a pfg .",
    "figure 5 shows the spectra of spin @xmath25 after the execution of these quantum circuits for all 1-sat and 2-sat of one clause with two variables .",
    "figures 6 and 7 show the experimental results of the partial problems for 1-sat , 2-sat and 3-sat of three variables . from these figures",
    "one can see that the solutions of a given sat problem are achieved from the resonance lines in the _ true _ space , as theoretically expected .",
    "accordingly , the parallel computation for sat problems with mixed states succeeds in nmr ensemble quantum computing .",
    "besides , from these figures , we can also see the small but significant distortions of the phases arising from the difficulty of implementing perfect selective pulses and inhomogeneity of the static magnetic field .",
    "it can be also seen that the distortions become larger as the system size is increased .",
    "in addition , the signal decay is mainly due to the relaxation effect of the low - power , long - duration transition - selective excitation .",
    "in summary , we give a general construction of qbcs for random sat problems by using c@xmath2-not and not gates and present a parallelization scheme for solving them with mixed states on a nmr quantum information processor .",
    "this model is an extension of `` one - qubit '' quantum computation .",
    "the present model uses quantum parallelism to perform computation in an essential way and then uses the topological nature of the nmr spectrum to obtain the computational results by monitoring spin @xmath25 with a single detection pulse , which in principle makes random np - complete sat problems be solved in polynomial time .",
    "meanwhile , we have experimentally implemented the scheme for several typical sat problems on a 3-qubit or 4-qubit nmr quantum processor .",
    "the experimental results are well consistent with the theoretical expectations . compared to hogg s algorithm@xcite ,",
    "this present scheme with a truly mixed input state avoids the pseudo - pure state preparation in nmr quantum computing so as to simplify the process of the whole experiment to solve such a problem .",
    "moreover , its feasibility is not limited in the restricted case of sat ( e.g. , hogg s algorithm for 1-sat and maximally constrained @xmath0-sat ) , but for random sat problems .",
    "however , it will require some additional qubits as scratchpads , which may increase the potential difficulty of finding a suitable sample . in principle",
    ", we can build up a recursive ( `` refresh '' ) procedure to minimize the number of scratchpads for saving space and the run - time cost . in order that all database can be distinguishable , the chosen sample is required to have a spin which has resolved scalar @xmath113 couplings to all other computational spins .",
    "though liquid - state nmr faces the difficulty of the scalability , the scheme of effectively finding the solutions to random sat problems with a great many variables presented in this paper can not only be realized in nmr quantum processors with a few qubits , but also might be feasible or instructive for other scalable quantum - processor implementations with similar features to the liquid - state nmr counterpart .",
