    "<S> we find that emission power for forward detuning @xmath67 is roughly independent of @xmath14 while photon emission for reverse detuning @xmath68 increases with @xmath14 [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : emission](c ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the power ratio @xmath69 approaches unity as @xmath53 approaches @xmath54 and the peaks merge [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : theory](b ) ] .    </S>",
    "<S> we model the behavior of the emitted power with increasing @xmath14 using a master equation approach . </S>",
    "<S> we describe the system by three possible states : qubit in the excited state @xmath65 ( excess electron in antibonding state ) , qubit in ground state @xmath70 ( excess electron in bonding state ) and qubit in state @xmath71 , which we define as the state with no excess electrons in the dots . </S>",
    "<S> this describes the system around the lower triple point . for the upper triple point </S>",
    "<S> , the third qubit state corresponds to two extra electrons in the dots leading to the same result . </S>",
    "<S> we arrive at the following rate equation for the occupation probabilities of the three qubit states @xcite : @xmath72 here , we neglect the relaxation rate @xmath73 from the excited to the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> this is justified because we estimate @xmath74 @xcite , which is significantly smaller than the tunneling rates to the leads @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> the same holds for the resonator - dot coupling @xmath76  mhz . we confirmed that including @xmath73 in the rate equation does not significantly affect the power ratio even for @xmath77  mhz .    </S>",
    "<S> because the resonant emission signal is generated in transitions from the excited state we expect the emission power to be proportional to @xmath78 , which is obtained using the steady - state condition @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> this yields the emission power ratio @xmath80    the experimental results are well approximated by this model [ black solid line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : theory](b ) ] </S>",
    "<S> . there is , however , a systematic deviation , such that the power ratios in all experimental data are slightly higher than the model predicts . we can account for this deviation by considering energy dependent tunnel rates @xmath3 and @xmath4 , see ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> note that , as for the resonant detuning [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : theory](a ) ] , there is no free fitting parameter .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we investigated photon emission from a biased double quantum dot dipole coupled to a microwave cavity . </S>",
    "<S> we clearly distinguish between background emission and resonant photon emission of the qubit generated in inelastic interdot transitions . </S>",
    "<S> we found photon emission for both forward and reverse interdot detuning with respect to source - drain bias reflecting the distribution of wavefunctions in the hybridized electronic states . </S>",
    "<S> we modeled the results using a master equation approach for the double quantum dot and found good agreement with the experiment . in future experiments , </S>",
    "<S> microwave correlation function measurements could be used to investigate photon statistics @xcite . for the low photon rates we detect from single - electron interdot transitions in our experiments </S>",
    "<S> photon antibunching is predicted @xcite .    </S>",
