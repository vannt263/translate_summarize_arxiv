    "the gama survey is a highly complete multi - wavelength database @xcite and galaxy redshift ( @xmath6 ) survey @xcite covering 280deg@xmath3 to a main survey limit of @xmath7mag in three equatorial ( g09 , g12 and g15 ) and two southern ( g02 and g23 ) regions .",
    "the spectroscopic survey was undertaken using the aaomega fibre - fed spectrograph in conjunction with the two - degree field ( 2df ) positioner on the anglo - australian telescope and contains @xmath2217,000 reliable redshifts covering @xmath8 with a median redshift of @xmath9 .",
    "the survey , and associated products , have provided a wealth of information regarding galaxy properties ( @xmath10 * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , large scale structure ( @xmath10 * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and the spatial distribution and properties of intermediate mass halos ( @xmath10 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to mention but a few key science projects .",
    "however , by its construction , the survey is necessarily limited to @xmath11 systems .",
    "little is known about the early time evolution of gama derived properties as we are essentially only , albeit comprehensively , probing these quantities over the last @xmath12gyrs . as such , it would greatly benefit the survey to obtain a high redshift benchmark with which to compare to the extensive low redshift data set .    while there are a number of spectroscopic surveys , and associated analysis , which extend to high redshift ( @xmath10 vvds , vipers , deep2 , zcosmos , primus - see below for details ) , in their current state , the variety of input catalogue selections , redshift identifications and subsequent analysis renders a direct comparison with gama problematic .",
    "however , it is possible to use these existing data sets to produce a gama comparable high redshift sample .",
    "the cosmic evolution survey region ( cosmos * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is ideally suited to this task , with extensive multi - wavelength broadband coverage from x - ray to radio wavelengths , including deep hubble space telescope imaging over the full 1.8deg@xmath3 region @xcite , and deep nir data from the ultravista survey @xcite , numerous spectroscopic campaigns and a comprehensive photometric redshift catalogue @xcite . in combination",
    "these data can be used to produce a highly complete , magnitude limited , sample of sources in the region with robust spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "essentially we can perform a comprehensive analysis of all available redshift information in the region to produce an accurate redshift catalogue , using the most robust and highest precision redshift available for each source .",
    "clearly , high resolution spectra are desirable and are in fact essential for analyses such as the identification of intermediate mass halos ( @xmath10 * ? ? ?",
    ". however , lower resolution redshifts , if robust , are likely to be adequate for a significant amount of the gama - type analysis , such as structural decomposition and mass - size evolution .",
    "in addition to the extensive multi - wavelength data already available , deep karl g. jansky very large array ( jvla ) 21-cm observations are currently underway in the cosmos regions as part of the cosmos hi large extragalactic survey ( chiles see , * ? ? ?",
    "chiles is an ska pathfinder survey which will target 21 cm hi emission at @xmath13 in a single @xmath20.3deg@xmath3 fwhm pointing in the cosmos region . forming a robust , magnitude limited spectroscopic sample in the chiles region",
    "will allow the chiles data to be fully exploited , leading to deep hi stacking of optically selected sources in order to constrain the low gas mass end of the hi mass function .",
    "in addition , comprehensive optically selected samples provide an accurate quantification of local environment through large - scale - structure , group catalogues and the local galaxy density .",
    "hi is a poor tracer of environment since it is anti - biased due to gas stripping in the highest density regions . as such",
    ", optical samples are required to constrain the environment of hi detected galaxies helping to explain the seemingly contradictory results of the environmental dependance on the hi mass function ( @xmath10 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    in conjunction with sed derived stellar masses ( such as those produced by gama and ultimately the sample here ) , the chiles data and spectroscopic catalogue defined in this work will allow a complete analysis of the baryonic mass function and stellar / gas mass ratios in a significantly large sample of galaxies .    while the majority of the cosmos region data has been made publicly available in a reduced",
    ", immediately useable format , one notable exception is the eso large - program spectroscopic survey , zcosmos @xcite - undertaken using the visible multi - object spectrograph ( vimos ) .",
    "the zcosmos survey targeted a total of @xmath14 sources in the cosmos region split into a ` bright ' survey ( targeting 20,000 i - band selected sources at @xmath15 ) and a ` deep ' survey ( targeting 10,000 colour - selected sources at @xmath16 ) . to date , the zcosmos team have only publicly released 10,109 redshifts from the ` bright ' survey ( the 10k release , * ? ? ? * ) . in this paper",
    "we re - reduce the entire zcosmos - bright data and provide the redshifts which were not publicly released as part of the the zcosmos - bright 10k sample - full details of the zcosmos survey can be found in @xcite and are summarised in section [ sec : spec_reduc ] .",
    "in addition to the zcosmos data set , there are a number of other spectroscopic surveys in the cosmos region .",

    "the spectral resolution of primus spectra is somewhat lower than zcosmos ( @xmath21500kms@xmath17 or r@xmath220 ) , but as noted above , is adequate for the bulk of our future analysis .    in this paper",
    "we construct an @xmath18-band and @xmath19-band magnitude limited sample in a sub region of cosmos ( the g10 region ) compiled from the zcosmos - bright 10k sample , primus , vvds , sdss and our own zcosmos re - reduction and analysis . where spectroscopic redshifts are not available we supplement our final catalogue with the accurate ( 30-band ) photometric redshifts of @xcite",

    "all data from this analysis , as well as a tool for displaying photometric data associated with each source in the cosmos region is made publicly available ( see appendix for details ) .",
    "to re - reduce all archival zcosmos - bright data we produced a bespoke r pipeline for the reduction of vimos spectroscopy .",
    "this pipeline is similar to that used in the redshift survey towards the cmb cold spot @xcite .",
    "briefly , all zcosmos - bright data and calibration files were downloaded from the eso archive ( pid:175.a-0839 , p.i .",
    "lily ) , then reduced and calibrated in a fully automated process ( see figure [ fig : flow ] ) .",
    "initially all science frames were matched with the correct calibration files using their mask number and observation date .",
    "we then identified all spectra in each individual science and flat field frame by taking a cross section through the image and identifying regions of the frame which are above the background level ( the fits header slit positions are found to be inaccurate and vary in offset with the true positions as a function of observation time and frame position ) .",
    "we extracted each 2d spectrum , removed bad pixels and cosmic rays , and flat fielded all raw science frames .",
    "next we performed a sky subtraction by fitting a weighted second order polynomial fit to each spectrum row , perpendicular to the dispersion axis ( weightings are used to exclude regions of source flux in the background estimation ) .",
    "zcosmos spectra were obtained using a ` jitter along the slit ' technique , where the target source is positioned at different pixel positions along the slit during each exposure .",
    "we corrected for jitter offsets and median combined all spectra .",
    "each combined spectrum is then wavelength calibrated by convolving the inverse fourier transforms of an arc lamp spectrum and known arc lamp emission line list .",
    "the vimos instrument was known to suffer from flexure issues during the zcosmos observations ( which have now been improved ) , these problems can cause variable wavelength offsets along the dispersion axis between individual exposures .",
    "this distortions are non linear and as such can not be corrected for by a rigid offset . in previous iterations of our reduction pipeline",
    "we have taken the time consuming approach of wavelength calibrating individual exposures , and correcting each spectrum for wavelength distortions prior to combination . however , in the zcosmos observations , we found the differences between wavelength distortions over individual exposures to be small ( a 2 pixel offset at most ) , and to be most pronounced at the very red end of each spectrum - where emission lines are strongly contaminated by skylines and are largely unusable .",
    "as such , we do not correct for this effect , but do allow for non - linear wavelength solutions in our final wavelength calibration .",
    "we note that for a small number of cases this marginally reduces our redshift accuracy , but will not significantly alter our results .    at this stage",
    "the pipeline outputs a reduced two - dimensional spectrum .",
    "we then median compressed each spectrum along the dispersion axis and identified the source continuum flux position along the spatial axis .",
    "we traced the continuum position of each source along the dispersion axis in order to identify any curvature in the spectrum on the ccd and performed an optimal extraction of source flux ; tracing the source curvature and identifying pixels in each row which have flux @xmath24 of the background level .",
    "lastly , we output wavelength calibrated , optimally extracted one - dimensional spectra for each zcosmos - bright target source .    the autoz fitting code does not use spectral shape in its redshift fitting , only emission and absorption features .",
    "hence , our pipeline is designed to maximise signal to noise in spectral features and does not conserve spectral shape or flux .",
    "four randomly selected examples of the final one - dimensional spectra from our reduction , can be seen in figure [ fig : specs ] .",
    "we find that our re - reduction of the zcosmos - bright data produces spectra which are largely consistent in signal to noise to the zcosmos - bright 10k release spectra . in some cases",
    "we find slightly higher signal emission line features ( as in gama catalogue i d , cataid=6000800 ) , while in other cases we find the signal to noise of emission line features slightly reduced ( as in cataid=6001080 ) .",
    "however , in using the original zcosmos - bright publicly released data in combination with our new reduction , we can hope to improve the number of galaxies with reliable redshifts in the cosmos region ( if only those which benefit from our new reduction method ) .",
    "we found that for @xmath21000 of the zcosmos - bright spectra our pipeline failed to successfully extract a one - dimensional spectrum .",
    "this was generally due to one of four problems :",
    "i ) the target source spectrum was heavily distorted on the ccd - causing the continuum to fall at the large angle across the spectrum and not entirely lie within the extracted 2d spectrum , ii ) the target source continuum was extremely close to the edge of the extracted 2d spectrum and fell partially off the edge , iii ) fringing in the sky lines at the red end of the spectrum were extremely strong and source continuum could not be identified and iv ) no source continuum could be identified but there were possible faint emission line features . in these cases",
    "we visually inspected the 2d spectra for each source and manually extracted a 1d spectrum , allowing for curvature .          in order to obtain redshifts from our independent zcosmos - bright data reduction we used an adapted version of the automatic redshift fitting code developed for gama spectroscopy , autoz @xcite . briefly",
    ", autoz continuum subtracts the target spectra and cross correlates with a sample of continuum subtracted galaxy templates to identify both absorption - line and emission - line features . in this process , deviations in the high - pass filtered spectra",
    "are clipped to exclude uncorrected artefacts and to reduce the significance given to single - line matches . for full details of the autoz code",
    "see @xcite .",
    "for use with our zcosmos data we applied a wrapper to the autoz code to perform additional skyline masking and to smooth the galaxy templates to zcosmos scales . if our initial best - fit autoz redshift is consistent with mis - identified sky lines ( as happens frequently for single line redshifts at @xmath25 in the zcosmos data ) , we use more heavily masked skylines in our reduced spectra and repeated our autoz analysis .",
    "autoz was run over all @xmath220,000 sources from our zcosmos reduction , details of how these redshifts were used in the construction of the final g10 sample are given in the following section .",
    "note that we do not use the redshift confidences provided by autoz in this work as they are calibrated for a specific telescope and instrumental setup .",
    "however , we do provide confidences for all autoz fits in our final g10 catalogue .",
    "to build our catalogue we initially matched the 2007 photometric catalogue described in @xcite to the updated 2008 cosmos catalogue including the deep subaru observations of @xcite , to obtain the optical - nir photometric data available for each source .",
    "we then matched each photometric source to the accurate 30-band photometric redshift catalogues of @xcite .",
    "these catalogues all contain cosmos survey ids and as such , do not require position matching .",
    "following this , we matched the zcosmos-10k bright @xcite , primus @xcite , vvds @xcite and sdss - dr10 @xcite sources to the photometrically identified sources using a 2@xmath26 match criteria - retaining quality flags for all sources .",
    "while the zcosmos - bright raw data is publicly available through the eso archive , we do not have access to the input catalogues of targets selected for the vimos observations .",
    "the zcosmos raw data contains the multi - object spectrograph ( mos ) slit position , but there is ambiguity between the slit position and the true sources targeted by the observation .",
    "in addition , multiple sources may fall in the same slit and hence , we must discern which photometric object relates to our re - reduced spectrum .",
    "we reconstructed the zcosmos - bright input catalogue using the details outlined in @xcite .",
    "we selected sources using the hst f814 magnitude , where available , and canada france hawaii telescope ( cfht ) @xmath19-band observation for regions without hst data , with a liberal criterion of @xmath27mag ( the zcosmos input catalogue is defined at @xmath28mag but is stated to contain a number of sources at @xmath19>@xmath29mag ) .",
    "both magnitudes were obtained from the @xcite catalogue used in the zcosmos input selection .    during the compilation of this catalogue we applied multiple position matching algorithms to match the raw data spectra positions to the photometric catalogue . however , due to the ambiguity between slit and true source positions , all algorithms resulted in a low efficiency of true source matching when visually inspected . in order to over come this , we visually inspected @xmath30 position matches and assigned the best visual match . in this process",
    "we initially estimated the source position within each slit by identifying the continuum emission offset from the slit centre and matched to the nearest @xmath28mag source .",
    "we then visually identified the best matched @xmath28mag source to each slit - taking into account all surrounding slit position .",
    "if no @xmath28mag source was within 10@xmath26 of the slit position ( the size of the zcosmos long - slit ) , we matched to a @xmath31 source . in this process",
    "we also identified possible repeat observations of the same source ( where two slit positions uniquely match to a single source ) and zcosmos-10k sources which are likely to be secondary sources which fall within the slit of primary target ( where two zcosmos-10k source uniquely match with a single slit position ) .",
    "we note that in our position matching we do not find a match for 245 zcosmos-10k sources .",
    "however , none of these sources have unmatched slit positions with 10@xmath26 and as such , are unlikely to be mis - matched to our spectroscopic catalogue .",
    "these galaxies are most likely to be targets for which our reduction pipeline has failed .",
    "we can estimate the failures in our matching to be consistent with the outlier rate between our redshift distributions ( section [ sec : sample ] ) , as any sources which is poorly matched in position are likely to have discrepant redshifts . comparing our final g10 with zcosmos-10k , primus , and the photometric redshifts",
    ", we obtain an outlier rate ( @xmath32 ) of @xmath33 .",
    "should the zcosmos - bright input catalogue be publicly released , it will be possible to test this validity further .",
    "the resultant @xmath19-band and @xmath18-band magnitude distribution of our re - reduced matched spectroscopic sample can be seen in figure [ fig : imag ] .",
    "this is consistent with the details of the zcosmos - bright input catalogue give in @xcite .",

    "in order to obtain the most robust and highest resolution redshifts for the full cosmos region we compared autoz , zcosmos-10k , primus , vvds , sdss and photometric redshifts for all sources in the region . in this manner",
    "we automatically assign redshifts as a first pass . in a second step , all sources are visually inspected and automatic redshift reliability assignments ( given below ) are superseded .",
    "firstly , sources were assigned one of the twelve classes given in table [ tab : red_origin ] , with a lower class number superseding a higher number from 1 - 10 ( classes 11 and 12 are additionally added vvds and sdss spectra ) .",
    "here we use a liberal matching criterion of redshifts agreeing to within @xmath3410% of the most robust redshift , but note that all sources are subsequently visually inspected and as such , the 10% match is only a rough estimate .",
    "classes are : 1=autoz and zcosmos-10k redshifts agree to within 10@xmath35 ( while this data has the same origin it is reduced and redshifted in a completely different manner ) , 2= autoz and primus redshifts agree to within 10@xmath35 , 3=zcosmos-10k and primus agree to within 10@xmath35 , 4=reliable zcosmos-10k ( as indicated by the zcosmos team ) redshift but does not meet any of the above criteria ( quality flags used are the same as those selected by * ? ? ?",

    ", we then additionally added robust vvds ( vvds team flags q=2 , 3 , 4 , 22 , 23 & 24 ) and sdss ( z@xmath37 < 0.001 & class=`galaxy ' ) redshifts to sources which do not currently have a robust redshift ( @xmath38 classes 5 - 10 ) .",
    "these are assigned classes 11 and 12 respectively .    for ease of use in our sample",
    "we then split our classifications into sources with robust redshifts from vimos or sdss spectra ( z_use=1 ) , robust redshifts from either vimos , sdss or primus spectra ( z_use=1@xmath392 ) , non - robust redshift but a spectroscopic observation ( z_use=3 ) and no spectra ( z_use=4 ) .",
    "these classifications form the basis of our final g10 sample . through our automatic redshift reliability assignments",
    "we obtain 12,776 robust vimos or sdss redshifts and an additional 5,437 robust primus redshifts .    following our automatic redshift reliability assignments",
    "we then visually inspected the 1d and 2d spectra for all @xmath220,000 zcosmos - observed sources and promoted sources with good redshifts to z_use=1 , and demoted those with unclear redshifts to z_use=3 . our final robust high resolution ( z_use=1 )",

    "these cutouts can also include overlays of @xcite source positions and zcosmos - bright slit positions including the position matching discussed in this work .",
