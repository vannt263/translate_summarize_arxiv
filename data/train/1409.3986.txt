    "the @xmath169 diffuse in a periodic box of size @xmath170 ; in the equilibrium state , they are distributed independently and uniformly throughout the box .",
    "if particle indices are ignored , the trajectories of the @xmath171 are the same as those of independent freely diffusing particles ( with no hard - core interaction ) .",
    "this mapping is valid because in terms of the density field , a `` collision '' between two particles has the same effect as two particles diffusing past each other .",
    "this means that multi - point space - time correlations of the density can in principle be calculated exactly .",
    "however , the activity @xmath15 requires that we keep track of particle indices and collisions .",
    "this means that the activity fluctuations in the model are not trivial , as is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : fdm ] .",
    "when evaluating the structure factor @xmath34 for the bhpm  we use the definition @xmath172 with @xmath173 and @xmath174 integer , so that @xmath175 at equilibrium ( @xmath43 ) , independent of @xmath35 .",
    "we argue that this structure factor has the same small-@xmath35 behaviour as the structure factors calculated directly from the particle positions @xmath3 , as follows .",
    "the structure factor for small @xmath35 can be inferred from the fluctuations of the number of particles @xmath176 within regions ( subsystems ) of size @xmath177 .",
    "the ` hat ' notation indicates that @xmath176 is a fluctuating quantity . for a homogeneous system , and assuming that @xmath104 is much larger than the particle spacing , we can equivalently consider the size @xmath178 of a subsystem ( or region ) containing exactly @xmath179 particles .",
    "if we take @xmath180 then we expect @xmath181 at equilibrium , this relation is most easily proved via correlation - response formulae for the isothermal compressibility , but we argue here that it also holds in the out - of - equilibrium states found in biased ensembles . to see this , define a local density @xmath182 , which may either be written as @xmath183 or obtained equivalently as @xmath184 . the variance of the local density",
    "may then be written either in terms of @xmath176 or @xmath178 .",
    "we assume ( based on a self - averaging argument ) that for large @xmath179 the fluctuations of @xmath178 are small , from which we obtain ( [ equ : fluct ] ) .",
    "finally , we note that if @xmath168 is the size of the hard particles then the probability distribution of @xmath178 satisfies @xmath185 , where @xmath186 is the distribution for particles of size @xmath168 and @xmath187 is the distribution for point - particles .",
    "hence @xmath188 is equal in both representations , which is sufficient to establish that the structure factors @xmath34 are equal ( up to a multiplicative constant ) . to simulate the bhpm",
    ", we use a monte carlo ( mc ) scheme : in each mc move a particle @xmath189 is chosen at random and a displacement @xmath190 is chosen uniformly between @xmath191 and @xmath192 .",
    "the move is rejected if moving the particle to @xmath193 involves a particle overlap , otherwise it is accepted . for small @xmath190 ,",
    "this scheme is equivalent to solving the langevin dynamics of the interacting particles ; a time @xmath194 in the langevin system corresponds to @xmath195 attempted mc moves per particle .",

    "as long as the frequency cutoff @xmath226 satisfies @xmath238 , we obtain @xmath239 while the derivation of this equation required a saddle - point approximation [ equivalent to the truncation at quadratic order in ( [ equ : lag - phi ] ) ] , it can be shown that this approximation becomes exact in the limit of large-@xmath104 . finally , converting from the rescaled parameters @xmath240 , @xmath241 , @xmath242 to the bare quantities",
    "@xmath210 , @xmath35 , @xmath37 yields ( [ equ : fh - sq ] ) of the main text .",
    "the requirement that @xmath104 be large while @xmath241 and @xmath242 are of order unity implies that ( [ equ : fh - sq ] ) is valid only for very small @xmath35 and @xmath37 , as discussed in the main text .",
    "now suppose that , instead of coupling @xmath243 to activity , we couple @xmath114 to the particle current @xmath113 . within fluctuating hydrodynamics , we write @xmath244 with @xmath245 . using the method of martin - siggia - rose - dedominicis - janssen  @xcite , we arrive at a path integral with lagrangian @xmath246 the system has periodic boundaries : if we assume ( as expected ) that @xmath247 for some @xmath248 , the last term in ( [ equ : lag - h ] ) vanishes after integration over @xmath11 .    expanding about the homogeneous stationary profile as in the activity - biased case , the analogue of ( [ equ : lag - quad ] ) of the main text is @xmath249 stability of the homogeneous profile requires @xmath250 , which is the case for exclusion processes and the bhpm .",
    "to proceed , we rescale co - ordinates as in the previous section , defining in addition @xmath251 .",
    "the calculation is almost identical so we give only a brief discussion : we find @xmath252 to obtain the structure factor , we perform a frequency integral , and the term @xmath253 plays no role since it can be absorbed by a shift of the integration variable .",
    "hence we arrive at the result for the structure factor ( in terms of the bare variables ) : @xmath254 ( note @xmath255 , by assumption . ) this is the same form as ( [ equ : fh - sq ] ) of the main text , but with @xmath256 and @xmath257 .",

    "<S> these results provide another example  @xcite of hyperuniformity emerging in non - equilibrium states , and they show that the dynamical phase transition identified in  @xcite corresponds physically to the appearance of hyperuniformity . more generally , the theory of fluctuating hydrodynamics indicates that these dynamical phase transitions should be generic ( `` universal '' ) in systems with locally - conserved hydrodynamic variables such as energy or density . the interplay between these phase transitions and the  glass transitions \" found previously in biased ensembles of trajectories  @xcite merits further study  diffusive large - scale behaviour is not a necessary condition for those glass transitions  @xcite , but the analysis presented here indicates that phase - separated states may compete with homogeneous glassy states in systems that are biased to low activity .    </S>",
