    "the theory of error - correcting codes for classical information has been extensively studied for almost fifty years . a fundamental question in coding theory concerns",
    "what _ capacity _ of information can be successfully transmitted through a noisy channel . call a code that maps @xmath3-bit inputs into @xmath4-bit codewords an @xmath5 code , and define its capacity to be @xmath6 . for any specific @xmath4-bit channel ,",
    "let its _ capacity _ be the maximum capacity of all @xmath5 codes that successfully transmit information through it .",
    "this capacity is often taken as an asymptotic limit as @xmath4 tends towards infinity .",
    "we consider two basic kinds of @xmath4-bit noisy channels .",
    "the first is one that flips any subset of up to @xmath7 bits of each codeword that passes through it . in this model ,",
    "transmission through the channel is considered successful if the @xmath3 bits of data can always be perfectly recovered .",
    "call a code that achieves this a _ @xmath7-error - correcting code_. asymptotically , it is natural to take @xmath7 as some fixed fraction @xmath0 of @xmath4 , written as @xmath8 and understood to mean @xmath9 . a second model of a noisy channel is one where each bit of each codeword that passes through it is flipped independently with probability @xmath0 . in this model , commonly referred to as the _ binary symmetric channel _ , there is no absolute bound on the number of possible errors that occur .",
    "therefore , a probabilistic definition of successful transmission is required . call a code",
    "for which the probability of successful recovery for any @xmath3 bits of data is at least @xmath10 an _ @xmath11-error - correcting code_.    the subject of error - correcting codes for _ quantum _ information is much younger , developing within the past couple of years , though it has received considerable attention during this time @xcite .",
    "much of the above terminology extends naturally to quantum information by considering qubits instead of bits .",
    "call a quantum code that maps @xmath3-qubit data to @xmath4-qubit codewords an @xmath12 code .",
    "we need to specify the behavior of noisy quantum channels .",
    "a natural quantum analogue of the first model is to allow any @xmath7 qubits of each codeword that passes through it to be altered",
    ". we can take this to mean : apply an arbitrary unitary transformation to all the qubits selected for alteration . an apparently stronger definition allows the unitary transformation to also involve another set of qubits , representing an `` external environment '' , thereby simulating the effect of `` decoherence '' .",
    "an apparently weaker definition limits the unitary operations to being among : @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , the standard pauli spin matrices , and @xmath16 , the unit matrix .",
    "it turns out that , by reasoning similar to that in @xcite , these three definitions of `` alter '' can be shown to be equivalent , in the sense that a code that is _ @xmath7-error - correcting _ with respect to the apparently weaker one will automatically be @xmath7-error - correcting with respect to the apparently stronger one .",
    "a quantum analog of the binary symmetric channel is the _ depolarizing channel _",
    ", where each bit of each codeword that passes through it is independently subjected to : @xmath16 with probability @xmath17 , and @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 each with probability @xmath18 .",
    "call a code that achieves a fidelity of at least @xmath10 on such a channel an _ @xmath11-error - correcting code_.    it has previously been shown @xcite how to take some special classical linear codes ( binary and over @xmath19 ) with certain properties and transform them into quantum codes with error - correcting capabilities . in the present paper , we show how to transform quantum codes with certain properties into classical codes with error - correcting capabilities .",
    "we do not propose this as a means for constructing new classical codes ; rather , this is a means for translating existing proofs of the _ non_existence of certain classical codes into new proofs of the nonexistence of certain quantum codes .",
    "our specific results , which apply to the class of _ stabilizer _ quantum codes ( defined in the next section ) , are :    by these results , we can immediately assert that , when we restrict our attention to stabilizer codes , the classical upper bounds in @xcite apply .",
    "in particular , when a quantum channel is subject to @xmath8 errors , the asymptotic capacity is bounded above by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the binary entropy function defined as @xmath22 . in fact , a slightly stronger but more complicated upper bound is proven in @xcite .",
    "this stronger bound is plotted in fig . 1 .",
    "this upper bound is stronger than the previously established @xmath23 bound in @xcite , though the latter bound has the advantage that it applies to nonstabilizer codes as well .",
    "it is noteworthy that all of the quantum codes proposed to date for the channels described above are stabilizer codes .",
    "other upper bounds exist for _ nondegenerate _ quantum codes ( see @xcite for a definition of nondegenerate ) .",
    "one is @xmath24 , and is based on an analogue of the classical `` sphere packing bound '' @xcite , and another asserts that the asymptotic capacity is zero if @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "it remains an open question whether the @xmath26 bound also applies to degenerate codes .",
    "very recently , it has been announced that the @xmath25 threshold bound _ does _ extend to nondegenerate codes , and this will be appear in a forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that there exist some degenerate stabilizer codes that outperform all known nondegenerate codes on the depolarizing channel , for some values of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the best lower bound for this channel that we are aware of is @xmath27 @xcite .    for the depolarizing channel with error probability @xmath0 ,",
    "our results imply that , for stabilizer codes , the capacity is upper bounded by @xmath2 , the bound for the classical binary symmetric channel @xcite .    for some values of @xmath0 , this is stronger than the previously established upper bound of @xmath23 @xcite , though the latter bound applies to nonstabilizer codes as well .",
    "the best lower bound that we are aware of for this channel is @xmath26 @xcite , and a slightly larger value for some values of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "should any improvements to the upper bounds in @xcite for classical coding occur , they will automatically apply to quantum stabilizer codes .",
    "our results demonstrate interesting connections between quantum stabilizer codes and classical linear codes , and , for some instances of channels , yield stronger upper bounds than those that have appeared to date .    in sections",
    "ii and iii , we provide a brief overview of quantum stabilizer codes and classical linear codes . in section iv",
    ", we describe how to construct a binary linear code from a quantum stabilizer code , and , in section v , we show that this construction yields the error - correcting properties required for theorems 1 and 2 .",
    "in @xcite it has been shown that many quantum codes can be described in terms of _",
    "stabilizers_. define a stabilizer as a set of @xmath4-qubit unitary operators such that : each operator is a tensor product of @xmath4 matrices of the form @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , with a global phase factor of @xmath28 ; and , the set of operators is an abelian group .",
    "the code that is defined by a stabilizer is the set of all @xmath4-qubit quantum states that are fixed points of each element of the stabilizer .",
    "a stabilizer can be most easily described by a set of operators that generate it .",
    "if one negates the phase factor of some of the generators , the resulting code will change , but will have identical characteristics to the original code .",
    "thus , one can always take the phase of each generator to be @xmath29 without any loss of generality .",
    "it is convenient to denote the generators of a stabilizer in the language of binary vector spaces , as in @xcite .",
    "denote the generator @xmath30 as the @xmath31 bit vector @xmath32 , where , for @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 for example , @xmath36 is denoted as latexmath:[$(\\ , 1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ ,    of any two generators @xmath32 and @xmath38 is equivalent ( modulo a phase factor of @xmath39 ) to @xmath40 , where @xmath41 denotes the bit - wise sum in modulo two arithmetic . also , @xmath32 and @xmath38 commute if and only if    @xmath42    where @xmath43 denotes the inner product in modulo two arithmetic .    a stabilizer",
    "can then be written as an @xmath44 matrix whose rows represent the generators .",
    "for example , @xmath45 represents the eight generators of the stabilizer of a specific @xmath46 code that is 1-error - correcting ( see @xcite for a detailed analysis of this code ) .",
    "in general , if there are @xmath4 qubits and @xmath47 generators , we can encode @xmath48 data qubits ( in the above example , @xmath49 ) .",
    "the error correcting capabilities of the code are related to commutativity relationships between the error operators and the generators @xcite .",
    "an @xmath5 binary linear code is a @xmath3 dimensional subspace of @xmath50 over modulo two arithmetic .",
    "it is sufficient to specify a basis @xmath51 for such a code .",
    "then the codeword for the @xmath3-bit string @xmath52 can be taken as the linear combination @xmath53 ( this mapping is a bijection between @xmath54 and the code ) . a natural way of specifying such a code is by an @xmath55 _ generator matrix _ , whose rows are @xmath51 .",
    "an example of such a code is @xmath56 which is a @xmath57 code that is 1-error - correcting .",
    "consider a quantum stabilizer code specified by a @xmath58 matrix @xmath59 .",
    "we shall show how to construct the generator matrix of a classical binary linear code with similar error - correcting capabilities .",
    "our construction involves a transformation of the generator matrix into a useful standard form along the lines of that in @xcite .",
    "this conversion is accomplished by applying a series of basic transformations of the following two types , each of which leaves the error - correcting characteristics of the code unchanged .",
    "the first is a _ row addition _",
    ", where the @xmath60row is added to the @xmath61row , where @xmath62 .",
    "this corresponds to replacing the @xmath61generator with the product of the @xmath61and @xmath60generator , and setting its phase to @xmath29 .",
    "the second is a _ column transposition _",
    ", where @xmath61column is transposed with the @xmath60column in the submatrices @xmath63 and @xmath64 simultaneously .",
    "this corresponds to transposing the @xmath61qubit position with the @xmath60qubit position .",
    "we begin by applying transformations of the above types to the matrix @xmath59 in order to obtain @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the rank of the submatrix @xmath63 , and @xmath67 .",
    "this is like performing gaussian elimination on the @xmath63 submatrix .",
    "next , by performing row additions among the last @xmath68 generators and column transpositions among the last @xmath69 qubit positions , the matrix can be further converted to the form @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the rank of @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "this is like performing gaussian elimination on the submatrix @xmath72 of ( [ stand1 ] ) .",
    "note that if @xmath75 and @xmath76 and then one of the last @xmath77 generators would not commute with one of the first @xmath66 generators .",
    "therefore , we can set @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 .",
    "thus , the form ( [ stand2 ] ) becomes @xmath81 where @xmath82 .",
    "call any set of generators in this form ( [ standard ] ) _ in standard form_.    for a generator matrix in standard form , consider the classical binary linear code generated by the @xmath83 matrix @xmath84 we claim that this classical code has similar characteristics to the original quantum code . before stating this precisely ,",
    "consider as an example the aforementioned @xmath46 code , that corrects one error , whose stabilizer was given by ( [ eight ] ) .",
    "converting it to standard form yields @xmath85 which is an equivalent @xmath46 code .",
    "the resulting binary linear code is @xmath86 which is a well - known @xmath87 code that corrects one error .",
    "thus , in this example , we obtain a classical code with slightly better capacity .",
    "the reader may recall that previous constructions of @xmath88 quantum codes have been based on the same classical code ( [ seven ] ) @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the present connection is quite different , as it involves an @xmath46 quantum code .    in the next section",
    "we shall show that , for any @xmath7-error - correcting @xmath12 quantum stabilizer code that is in standard form ( [ standard ] ) , the matrix ( [ classical ] ) generates a @xmath7-error - correcting @xmath89 binary linear code .",
    "also , for the case of the depolarizing channel , we shall show that , for any @xmath11-error - correcting @xmath12 quantum stabilizer code in standard form ( [ standard ] ) , the matrix ( [ classical ] ) generates an @xmath11-error - correcting @xmath89 binary linear code .",
    "furthermore , by applying operations of the types below , which also do not affect the error - correcting capabilities of the code @xcite , we can guarantee the additional property that @xmath90 , which slightly sharpens the result .",
    "the first operation is the _ column switch _ , in which the @xmath61column of submatrix @xmath63 is transposed with the @xmath61column of submatrix @xmath64 .",
    "this corresponds to : in the @xmath61qubit position , changing each instance of a @xmath13 in each generator to a @xmath15 , and each instance of a @xmath15 to a @xmath13 ( while leaving each @xmath16 and @xmath14 intact ) .",
    "the second operation is the _ column addition _ , in which the @xmath61 column of submatrix @xmath64 is added to the @xmath61column of submatrix @xmath63 .",
    "this corresponds to : in the @xmath61qubit position , changing each instance of a @xmath14 in each generator to a @xmath15 , and each instance of a @xmath15 to a @xmath14 ( while leaving each @xmath16 and @xmath13 intact ) .",
    "see @xcite for an explanation of why these two operations do not affect the characteristics of the code .",
    "in this section , we show that the constructions of the previous section satisfy the claimed error - correcting properties .",
    "the classical code whose generator matrix is given by ( [ classical ] ) consists of @xmath91 codewords in the space @xmath92 .",
    "we shall construct an _ isomorphism _ between this code and a restricted version of the quantum code specified by ( [ standard ] ) .",
    "the restricted version of the quantum code consists of @xmath91 codewords that are contained in a special set @xmath93 of @xmath94 distinct @xmath4-qubit states .",
    "this set @xmath93 has the property that it is closed with respect to @xmath15 errors among the first @xmath95 qubit positions .",
    "intuitively , the effect of bit errors on classical codewords within the space @xmath92 is equivalent to the effect of @xmath15 errors in the first @xmath95 qubit positions on quantum codewords within the space @xmath93 .",
    "formally , the isomorphism that we shall construct is a mapping @xmath96 , such that :    1 .",
    "@xmath97 is bijective .",
    "2 .   for each @xmath98 that is a codeword of the classical code , @xmath99 is a codeword of the quantum code .",
    "3 .   for each codeword @xmath98 of the classical code , and each error vector @xmath100 , @xmath101    the existence of such an isomorphism means that an error in the @xmath61bit of the classical code ( for any @xmath102 ) corresponds to a @xmath15 error in the @xmath61qubit of the restricted version of the quantum code . more precisely ,",
    "if the quantum code can correct any @xmath7 errors then it can correct any @xmath7 @xmath15 errors among the first @xmath95 qubit positions , and then the following procedure for correcting any @xmath7 errors in the classical code exists . given a codeword @xmath103 subjected to an error vector @xmath104 of weight bounded by @xmath7 ,",
    "first apply the mapping @xmath97 to it . by the second and third properties of @xmath97 , the result is @xmath99 subjected to at most @xmath7 @xmath15 errors among the first @xmath95 qubit positions , which can therefore be corrected . by the first property",
    ", @xmath105 can be applied to this corrected quantum codeword , yielding the correction of the original codeword . therefore , if we establish that there exists a @xmath97 that satisfies the above three properties then the classical code specified by ( [ classical ] ) must correct at least as many errors as the quantum code specified by ( [ standard ] ) .    for the case of the depolarizing channel with parameter @xmath0 ,",
    "if the quantum code attains fidelity @xmath10 then it attains fidelity @xmath10 for a channel that applies @xmath15 in each of the first @xmath95 qubit positions independently with probability @xmath0 ( in fact we may need to slightly modify the code by applying some column switch and column addition operations  defined in section iv  along the lines of the `` twirling '' techniques explained in @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the corresponding classical code is correcting with probability at least @xmath10 on a binary symmetric channel with parameter @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the existence of the above @xmath97 also suffices for this noisy channel model .    in order to construct a bijection @xmath97 with the above properties",
    ", we shall construct a useful basis for the quantum code .",
    "we begin with the stabilizer specified by the matrix in standard form ( [ standard ] ) .",
    "call the operators corresponding to the respective rows of this matrix @xmath106 . define the additional operators @xmath107 in terms of the matrix @xmath108 where @xmath109 , and @xmath110 in terms of the matrix @xmath111 by considering ( [ standard ] ) , ( [ phase ] ) , ( [ bit ] ) , and recalling the criterion for commutativity ( [ commute ] ) ,",
    "it is straightforward to verify that :    * @xmath112 is a set of @xmath4 independent commuting operators .",
    "* @xmath113 is a set of @xmath4 independent commuting operators . *",
    "each @xmath114 and @xmath115 commute if @xmath116 and anticommute if @xmath117 .",
    "using these properties , we can construct a basis @xmath118 for the code with some useful structural features .",
    "first , set @xmath119 to be the quantum state stabilized by @xmath112 ( this state is unique up to a global phase factor ) .",
    "in fact , @xmath120 is a quantum state with this property .",
    "next , for each @xmath121 , set @xmath122 . since @xmath114 commutes with @xmath115 if and only if @xmath117 , @xmath123 is in the + 1-eigenspace of each @xmath106 and the @xmath124 eigenspaces of @xmath107 , respectively .",
    "therefore , these states are an orthogonal basis for the quantum code .",
    "now , define the function @xmath96 as @xmath125 for each @xmath98 .",
    "we shall show that @xmath97 satisfies the three required properties . by considering ( [ standard ] ) and",
    "( [ phase ] ) , the operator that applies @xmath15 to the @xmath61qubit ( and @xmath16 to all other qubits ) anticommutes with the @xmath61generator in the sequence @xmath126 and commutes with all others .",
    "therefore , @xmath99 is in the @xmath127 eigenspaces of @xmath126 , respectively ( recall that @xmath128 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath99 is orthogonal for each distinct @xmath103 .",
    "this proves the first property , that @xmath97 is a bijection .",
    "also , due to the close similarity between ( [ classical ] ) and ( [ bit ] ) , @xmath129 so the second property for @xmath93 holds .",
    "finally , the third property for @xmath93 holds because , using ( [ phi ] ) and ( [ similar ] ) , @xmath130 thus , @xmath97 satisfies the three required properties .",
