    "since we have already discussed the dependence of @xmath54 on @xmath53 above , we will focus here on the fano factor calculated over long time windows , @xmath36 .",
    "we first consider parameter regimes where the effective rate of presynaptic inputs is much slower than the rate of vesicle recovery ( @xmath216 ) . in such a regime , each contact is likely to recover between two consecutive presynaptic spikes and therefore all @xmath1 contacts are likely to have a vesicle ready to release when each spike arrives ( fig .",

    "for the irregular and regular input models , eq .   should be interpreted heuristically , as it was derived heuristically .",

    "regardless , we verify numerically that eq .   is accurate when",
    "@xmath38 is decreased toward zero while keeping @xmath64 fixed ( fig .",
    "[ f : rinvsfx ] ) .",
    "we now discuss the statistics of the postsynaptic response when the effective presynaptic spiking is much faster than vesicle recovery ( @xmath205 ) .",
    "in such a regime , incoming spikes occur much more frequently than recovery events and synapses becomes depleted .",
    "as a result , the number of vesicles released over a long time window is determined predominantly by the number of recovery events in that time window and largely independent from the number of presynaptic spikes ( fig .",
    "[ f : tracesslowfast]b ) @xcite .",
    "the synaptic response therefore inherits the poisson statistics of the recovery events so that @xmath228 for the poisson input model , this limit can be made more precise in the @xmath229 limit by expanding eq .   in terms of the parameter @xmath230 to obtain @xmath231 which converges to 1 as @xmath232 . for the irregular and regular input models , we verify in fig .",

    "as discussed above , this promotes poisson - like variability in the synaptic response .",
    "this provides one possible mechanism through which irregular poisson - like firing can be sustained in neuronal populations  @xcite .",
    "we used continuous time markov chain methods to derive the response statistics of a stochastic model of short term synaptic depression with three different presynaptic input models .",
    "we then used this analysis to understand how the mean presynaptic firing rate and the variability of presynaptic spiking interact with synaptic dynamics to determine the mean rate of vesicle release and variability in the number of vesicles released .",
    "this analysis revealed a number of fundamental , qualitative dependencies of response statistics on presynaptic spiking statistics .",
    "some of the dependencies have been previously noted in the literature and some have not .",
    "the number of vesicles released over a time window is smaller for irregular inputs than for more regular inputs ( figs .",
    "[ f : rinvsrx ] and [ f : tracesbg ] ) given the same number of presynaptic spikes .",
    "thus , regular presynaptic spiking is more efficient at driving synapses .",
    "this mechanism competes with a well - known property of excitable cells : that they are driven more effectively by irregular , positively correlated synaptic input currents  @xcite .",
    "in addition , a _ population _ of presynaptic spike trains drives a postsynaptic neuron more efficiently when the population - level activity is more irregular , for example due to pairwise correlations  @xcite .",
    "together , these results suggest that a postsynaptic neuron is most efficiently driven by presynaptic populations that exhibit small or negative auto - correlations , but positive pairwise cross - correlations .",
    "our model predicts that the de - correlating effects of short term depression and stochastic vesicle dynamics can produce negative temporal auto - correlations in the synaptic response even when presynaptic spiking is temporally uncorrelated or positively correlated , in agreement with previous studies  @xcite .",
    "this yields a response fano factor that decreases with window size , as observed in some recorded data  @xcite .",
    "we note , though , that some parameter choices can yield positively a correlated synaptic response when presynaptic inputs are positively correlated  @xcite and neuronal membrane dynamics can introduce positive correlations to a postsynaptic spiking response even when synaptic currents are not positively correlated in time  @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with several studies showing positive temporal correlations in recorded spike trains  @xcite .",
    "we predict that moderate or high firing rates can induce a poisson - like synaptic response even when presynaptic inputs are non - poisson ( fig .",
    "[ f : rinvsfx ] and @xcite ) .",
    "this is because even moderate firing rates can deplete synapses and depleted synapses inherit the poisson - like variability of synaptic vesicle recovery ( fig .",
    "[ f : tracesslowfast]b and @xcite ) . at lower firing rates , short term depression and synaptic variability can increase or decrease fano factor .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ f : rinvsfx]b , the response fano factor is larger than the presynaptic fano factor ( @xmath206 ) at low firing rates , decreases at higher firing rates , then approaches @xmath234 at higher firing rates .",
    "this complex dependence of firing rate on fano factor might be related to the stimulus dependence of fano factors observed in several cortical brain regions  @xcite .",
    "our conclusion that fast presynaptic spiking causes poisson - like variability in the synaptic response relied on the assumption that vesicle recovery times are exponentially distributed .",
    "the exponential distribution is a justifiable choice for recovery times only if recovery times obey a memoryless property : having already waited @xmath5 units of time for a recovery event , the probability of waiting an additional @xmath235 units of time does not depend on @xmath5 .",
    "the precise mechanics of vesicle re - uptake and docking determine whether this is an appropriate assumption .",
    "if recovery times have a different probability distribution , then the synaptic response will inherit the properties of this distribution at high presynaptic firing rates instead of inheriting the poisson - like nature of exponentially distributed recovery times .",
    "previous methods have been developed to analyze the synaptic response of the model used here . in   @xcite ,",
    "the model restricted to the @xmath236 case is analyzed for presynaptic spike trains that are renewal processes .",
    "this includes the poisson and the regular input model discussed here , but excludes the irregular input model in which the spike train is a non - renewal inhomogeneous poisson process . in  @xcite approximations",
    "are obtained for the case where the presynaptic spike train is an inhomogeneous poisson process , but the approximation is only valid when the rate - modulation of the poisson process is small compared to the average firing rate .",
    "thus , these approximations are only valid for the irregular input model when @xmath237 .",
    "other studies  @xcite use a deterministic synapse model that implicitly treats the number of available vesicles as a continuous rather than a discrete quantity .",
    "this deterministic model represents the trial average of the model considered here and can vastly underestimate the variability of a synaptic response  @xcite .",
    "a more detailed synapse model allows for multiple docking sites at a single contact  @xcite .",
    "this model can yield different response properties than the model used here in certain parameter regimes  @xcite .",
    "even though this more detailed model can be represented as a continuous - time markov chain , the analysis of this model would be significantly more complex than the analysis considered here since it would be necessary to keep track of the number of readily releasable vesicles at each contact separately .",
    "this would result in a markov chain with @xmath238 states where @xmath1 is the number of contacts , @xmath239 is the number of docking sites per contact and @xmath240 is the number of states used for the presynaptic input model ( @xmath241 for the poisson input model , @xmath242 for the irregular input model , and @xmath243 for the regular input model ) .    to quantify the synaptic response to a presynaptic spike train , we focused on the statistics of the number of vesicles released in a time window .",
    "postsynaptic neurons observe changes in synaptic conductance in response to presynaptic spikes .",
    "the synaptic conductance are often modeled in such a way that they can be easily derived from our process @xmath14 through a convolution : @xmath244 where @xmath245 is the synaptic conductance elicited by a presynaptic spike train and @xmath246 is a kernel representing the characteristic postsynaptic conductance elicited by the release of a single neurotransmitter vesicle . since this",
    "mapping is linear , the statistics of @xmath245 can easily be derived in terms of the statistics of @xmath14  @xcite ."
