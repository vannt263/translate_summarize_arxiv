    "it is well known that the interaction of charged spin-1/2 fermions with the electromagnetic field is described by the minimal coupling in the form of dirac equation .",
    "pauli @xcite suggested a non - minimal coupling of spin 1/2-particle with electromagnetic fields , which can be interpreted as an effective interaction of fermion to describe the anomalous magnetic moment of fermions .",
    "pauli interaction is particularly interesting for describing the interaction of neutral particle with electromagnetic field provided it has a non - vanishing magnetic dipole moment @xcite .",
    "one of the immediate possibilities @xcite is the electromagnetic interaction(pauli interaction ) of neutrinos , which are recently confirmed to have a non - zero mass with mixing @xcite .",
    "the presence of the magnetic dipole moment implies that neutrino can directly couple to the electromagnetic field , which leads to a variety of new processes @xcite .",
    "one of the interesting phenomena with the strong electromagnetic field configuration is the pair creation of particles .",
    "the well known example is the schwinger process with the minimal coupling , in which charged particles are created in pairs @xcite under a strong electric field .",
    "however it has been demonstrated that no particle creation is possible under the pure magnetic field configuration even with the spatial inhomogeneity @xcite . for a neutral particle with the pauli interaction ,",
    "the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field coupled directly to the magnetic dipole moment plays an interesting role analogous to the electric field for a charged particle .",
    "the non - zero gradient of the magnetic field can exert a force on a magnetic dipole moment such that the neutral fermion can get an energy out of the magnetic field .",
    "hence it will affects the vacuum structure greatly for the strong enough magnetic field as for the case of charged particles in the strong electric field .",
    "it is then interesting to see whether the vacuum production of neutral fermion with a non - zero magnetic moment in an inhomogeneous magnetic field is possible on the analogy of the schwinger process .",
    "interestingly it has been demonstrated in 2 + 1 dimension that the magnetic dipole coupled to the field gradient induces pair creations in a vacuum @xcite . in this work , we will present a realistic calculation in 3 + 1 dimension for the pair production rate of neutral fermions with non - vanishing magnetic dipole moment .",
    "the simplest lagrangian for the neutral fermion , which couples to the external electromagnetic field , was suggested by pauli long time ago @xcite .",
    "the dirac equation with pauli term is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 , ~~g_{\\mu\\nu}=(+,-,-,-)$ ] .",
    "@xmath2 in the pauli term measures the magnitude of the magnetic dipole moment of fermion .",
    "pauli term can be considered as an effective interaction which describes anomalous magnetic moment of fermion or as an effective magnetic moment induced by the bulk fermions in a theory with large extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "the corresponding pauli hamiltonian operator is @xmath3 where @xmath4 . if the magnetic field is stronger than the critical field , @xmath5 , a negative energy state of @xmath6 appears .",

    "this implies the renormalization of the magnetic moment @xmath2 to the measured value and the coupling of @xmath61 to zero presumably . the effective potential , eq.(@xmath62 ) , for uniform magnetic fields is found to be real , which implies a stable magnetic background of @xmath63 .",
    "for magnetic fields weaker than the critical field @xmath64 , using a contour integration in the fourth quadrant , the integration can be done along the negative imaginary axis giving the finite real effective action as @xmath65 the leading radiative correction term for a weak @xmath66 field is @xmath67    for an inhomogeneous field configuration , @xmath68 , the effective potential is given by @xmath69 where an additional divergent contribution at @xmath59 is removed by adding a local counter term of @xmath70 in the second term .",
    "the leading radiative correction terms of the effective potential for a small gradient weak @xmath66 field are calculated as given by @xmath71    it is found that the effective potential , eq.(@xmath72 ) , has a non - vanishing imaginary part , which implies that the background of inhomogeneous magnetic field configuration is unstable against the creation of neutral fermions with pauli interaction . from the imaginary part of the effective potential eq.(@xmath72 ) , we obtain the production rate density , @xmath73))$ ] .",
    "introducing dimensionless parameters defined as @xmath74 , the production rate density @xmath75 in the unit of the fermion mass is finally given by @xmath76 where @xmath77 since the scale of inhomogeneity less than compton wavelength of the fermion is irrelevant to the particle production through this process , we take in this work the spatial gradient of the magnetic field @xmath78 to be smaller than the ratio of field strength , @xmath79 , to the compton wavelength @xmath80 , that is , @xmath81 .",
    "the integration eq.(@xmath82 ) is a finite integration , but has singularities along the imaginary @xmath83 axis similarly to the schwinger s result , where the residue calculation gives the analytic wkb type expression .",
    "however , the integration eq.(@xmath82 ) has essential sigularities along the imaginary axis , so that it seems not possible to get a usual analytic wkb type expression using a contour integration .",
    "therefore we use numerical integrations to investigate the properties of the production rate density given by eq.(@xmath82 ) . for the numerical calculation",
    ", we consider the case of @xmath84 and @xmath85 as an example .",
    "numerical integrations of the production rate density show that the second term of eq.(@xmath82 ) is negligible compared to the first term for @xmath85 .",
    "the production rate shows exponential monotonic decrease for @xmath86 and @xmath84 .",
    "the production rate , @xmath75 , is calculated for @xmath87 and @xmath88 as a function of @xmath89 .",
    "the results in the unit of @xmath90 are as shown in [ fig.1 - 2 ] .",
    "the results of numerical calculations are represented by dots in the figures .",
    "the numerical integrations of eq.(@xmath82 ) suffer from large oscillatory fluctuation , which is an unavoidable feature due to the violent oscillations in the integrand as discussed in @xcite . to get an analytic expression",
    ", we obtain the best fit of the numerical results to the curves in the form of @xmath91 for [ fig.1 - 2 ] .",
    "we can observe that the particle creation rate is an exponentially decreasing function with respect to the inverse of the field gradient , @xmath92 which shows the characteristics of the non - perturbative process .",
    "this can be understood as a quantum tunnelling through a potential barrier of height @xmath93 of a particle exposed to an potential energy @xmath94 due to the inhomogeneous magnetic field coupled to the magnetic dipole moment through pauli interaction .",
    "it is similar to the schwinger process of electron - positron pair creation in the strong electric field , where the creation rate is decreasing exponentially @xcite , @xmath95 .",
    "one can see that the production rate is suppressed very rapidly when the field strength becomes weaker than @xmath96 as well as the inhomogeneity scale is bigger than compton wave length scale . for the inhomogeneity in the compton wave length scale ,",
    "the rate per unit time per unit volume is typically of order @xmath97 for the critical field strength .",
    "however for the realistic estimation of the production rate , more precise information on the mass and magnetic moment of a particle and the strength of the magnetic field as well as the scale of the spatial inhomogeneity of the field in consideration are needed for the observational possibility . as a possible environment ,",
    "let us consider the pair creation of neutrino with a non - zero magnetic dipole moment in the vicinity of the very strongly magnetized compact objects with @xmath98 g as a typical strength @xcite .",
    "taking the possible magnetic moment to be as large as the experimental upper bound @xmath99 and the mass of the neutrino to be @xmath100 ev constrained by the solar neutrino observations , the critical field strength is estimated to be @xmath101 g. one can see that the condition for @xmath102 or @xmath103 assumed in this work is satisfied .",
    "since the the scale of the inhomogeneity is naturally about the size of the compact object , @xmath104 m , which is much larger than the compton wave length @xmath105 m , the production rate is expected to be substantially suppressed from the typical rate such that it may not provide sufficiently high luminosity for the neutrino detectors .",
    "we have examined the vacuum production of neutral fermions in inhomogeneous magnetic fields through pauli interaction .",
    "the fermions , which are coupled to the background electromagnetic field through pauli interaction , are integrated out and there appears an imaginary part in the effective action .",
    "it turns out that the production rate density depends on both the gradient and the strength of magnetic fields in 3 + 1 dimension , which is quite different from the result in 2 + 1 dimension @xcite , where the production rate depends only on the gradient of the magnetic fields , not on the strength of the magnetic fields .",
    "the difference can be attributed to the different nature of spinors in 3 + 1 and 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "the vacuum production of fermion with the pauli interaction is found to be a magnetic effect .",
    "explicit calculations with a linear electric field configuration of @xmath106direction with a constant gradient along @xmath106direction such that @xmath107 shows that the effective potential has no imaginary part when the singularities are regularized properly .",
    "it can be also shown by substituting @xmath108 and @xmath109 in the effective potential for a pure magnetic field eq.(@xmath110 ) with the @xmath111 integration along the imaginary axis .",
    "therefore one can see that the pair creation through pauli interaction is a purely magnetic effect .",
    "it is an interesting result when compared to the pair creation of charged particles through the minimal coupling , which is known to be an electric effect @xcite .",
    "although the production rate density in this work has been derived for @xmath112 , it can be applicable to various types of magnetic fields provided that the magnetic field is linear in the scale of compton wavelength of the particle considered because the particle production rate density is a local quantity",
    ". it may be therefore applicable to a spatially slowly varying @xmath113 as a good approximation if the gradient variation is very small in the compton wavelength scale .",
    "for the realistic calculation of the production rate , more precise information on the mass and magnetic moment of a particle and the strength of the magnetic field as well as the scale of the spatial inhomogeneity of the field in consideration are needed for the observational possibility ."
