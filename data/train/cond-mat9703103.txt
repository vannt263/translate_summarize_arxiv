    "<S> 54.8pt 54.8pt we show that weak off - diagonal disorder in degenerate ground state conjugated polymers results in a finite density of randomly positioned kinks ( solitons and antisolitons ) in the lattice dimerization . for realistic values of the disorder </S>",
    "<S> , these kinks should clearly show up in the optical and magnetic properties .    for over thirty years </S>",
    "<S> , conjugated polymers have provided a rich field of fundamental and technological research @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they belong to a large class of quasi - one - dimensional peierls materials , in which the lattice distorts due to its interaction with itinerant electrons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> much attention has been devoted to trans - polyacetylene , which has a doubly degenerate ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the degeneracy allows for topological excitations , solitons , which are kinks in the lattice dimerization accompanied by a local distortion of the electron density @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> solitons provide a simple explanation of the unusual properties of doped trans - polyacetylene @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they also feature in quantum lattice fluctuations , which lead to subgap optical absorption @xcite and may be responsible for an enhanced nonlinear optical response @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> solitons were first found in the free - electron ssh model @xcite . their topological nature , however , allows them to survive also in the presence of on - site coulomb repulsion ( peierls - hubbard model ) @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> although real polymer materials contain many types of defects , most theoretical studies have been restricted to perfect chains . due to the quasi - one - dimensional nature of polymers , however , any disorder will play a major role in determining their properties . in this letter , we study the effects of weak disorder in the electron hopping amplitudes in polyacetylene chains . </S>",
    "<S> such ( off - diagonal ) disorder arises from random chain twists that diminish the overlap between the @xmath0-orbitals of neighboring carbon atoms . in previous analytical studies , </S>",
    "<S> off - diagonal disorder was modeled by small fluctuations of the peierls order parameter around an average value @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> numerical calculations showed , however , that if the lattice configuration of a weakly disordered chain described by the ssh model is allowed to relax , it may contain solitons , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , large ( nonperturbative ) variations of the order parameter @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the lattice response to the disorder can not be neglected . an analytical theory for this phenomenon and an estimate ( either numerical or analytical ) for the density of thus created kinks , have sofar not been given . in this letter , we address these issues and we show that , in fact , arbitrarily small off - diagonal disorder leads to a finite density of solitons . </S>",
    "<S> our arguments also hold in the presence of electron correlations .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider a half - filled chain , in which itinerant ( @xmath0 ) electrons interact with the classical carbon lattice . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the chain hamiltonian contains three contributions : ( i ) the electron hopping between adjacent carbon atoms , ( ii ) the elastic energy of the lattice , and ( iii ) the coulomb repulsion between the electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the hopping amplitude has the form , @xmath1 here the first term is the bare amplitude and the second term describes the electron - phonon interaction , where @xmath2 is the coupling constant and @xmath3 denotes the displacement of the @xmath4th carbon atom from its uniform - lattice position . finally , the third term is a random contribution , which we include to describe the conformational disorder . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the fluctuations @xmath5 are frozen ( `` quenched '' disorder ) and that they are independent for different links . </S>",
    "<S> we will restrict ourselves to zero - temperature properties .    </S>",
    "<S> as we shall shortly see , for weak disorder the spatial extension of a disorder fluctuation necessary to create a kink is much larger than one lattice unit , which allows us to use a continuum model </S>",
    "<S> . then eq.([hop ] ) is replaced by , @xmath6 where the lattice dimerization @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is the lattice constant ) describes the alternating part of the hopping amplitude determined by the shifts @xmath3 of the carbon atoms ( cf . the continuum version of the ssh model @xcite ) and @xmath9 describes the disorder part with a gaussian correlator , @xmath10 note , that while chain twists always decrease the hopping amplitudes ( @xmath11 ) , @xmath12 can be both positive and negative , as it is the alternating part of the fluctuations .    </S>",
    "<S> it should now be realized that in a consistent treatment of disorder , @xmath13 implicitly depends on the @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that at zero temperature @xmath13 for a particular disorder realization is found by minimizing the total ( electronic plus lattice ) energy </S>",
    "<S> . the total energy reads , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath14 + \\frac{1}{\\pi \\lambda v_f } \\int \\!\\!dx \\delta_{lat}^{2}(x ) \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the dimensionless electron - phonon coupling constant ( @xmath16 is the spring constant ) , @xmath17 is the bare value of fermi velocity , and we set @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the electron energy depends on @xmath19 defined by eq.([model ] ) , which includes the changes of the hopping amplitudes due to both the lattice distortion and the disorder . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that in what follows we will not need an explicit expression for the electron energy , which enables us to include the electron - electron interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we will assume , however , that in the absence of disorder the total energy of a half - filled chain has two minima , both corresponding to a uniform dimerization , @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> we will also assume that the model admits soliton solutions , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , apart from the above minima , the total energy has an infinite number of extrema @xmath21 corresponding to the presence of @xmath22 kinks ( solitons and antisolitons interpolating between @xmath23 and @xmath24 and vice versa ) , whose positions are described by the @xmath22-dimensional vector @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> both the ssh and the peierls - hubbard model have these properties . </S>",
    "<S> if the average separation between neighboring kinks is large compared to the correlation length @xmath26 , the configuration with @xmath22 kinks has energy , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the energy needed to create a single soliton . </S>",
    "<S> the kinks can be either charged and spinless or neutral with spin @xmath29 @xcite . in the ssh model , </S>",
    "<S> the two types have the same energy , while in the presence of coulomb repulsion the neutral soliton is energetically favorable @xcite and in undoped chains will be the only type of kink that occurs at zero temperature .    at weak disorder , @xmath30 , </S>",
    "<S> linear response theory predicts small fluctuations of the ground state lattice configuration around the uniformly dimerized lattice . </S>",
    "<S> we will show , however , that for arbitrarily weak disorder the ground state configuration can not be found using linear response theory , as the configuration with small fluctuations around a chain containing a number of solitons may have a lower energy than the one with small fluctuations around uniform dimerization .    </S>",
    "<S> to first order in @xmath12 , the correction to the energy of a multikink configuration reads , @xmath31 where the extremum condition for the ordered configuration @xmath21 was used . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the change of the total energy of the uniformly dimerized state ( @xmath32 ) due to disorder reads , @xmath33 consider now , on the other hand , the same chain with an antisoliton at @xmath34 and a soliton at @xmath35 , chosen in such a way that the whole disorder fluctuation lies between @xmath34 and @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the change of energy due to disorder for this configuration equals @xmath36 , because between @xmath34 and @xmath35 @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> we thus find that in the disordered chain , the configuration with a soliton - antisoliton pair is energetically favorable to the uniform configuration if @xmath38 here @xmath39 , which in the case of the ssh model equals 1 . </S>",
    "<S> it should be stressed that as long as the kink density is indeed small compared to @xmath40 , the entire effect of electron - electron interactions is contained in the factor @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that , no matter how small the disorder is , the fluctuations in @xmath42 grow with the chain size , so that for a sufficiently long chain the inequality eq.([pair ] ) will certainly be fulfilled .    </S>",
    "<S> the creation of kinks by off - diagonal disorder is illustrated in fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> the thick line is the ground state order parameter @xmath43 for a discrete chain of 160 carbon atoms , obtained by numerically minimizing the total energy for one particular realization of the disorder . in this example </S>",
    "<S> , we neglected the coulomb repulsion and used standard ssh parameters . </S>",
    "<S> it is clearly seen that the order parameter fluctuates near a soliton - antisoliton pair configuration . </S>",
    "<S> the disorder realization that was used as input is visualized by the thin line , which gives @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the thin line in fact directly represents the order parameter along the chain if we neglect the lattice relaxation . in that case </S>",
    "<S> , no lattice kinks are created .    in order to obtain an estimate for the density of disorder - induced kinks , we consider a disorder fluctuation with spatial size @xmath46 and constant value @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> then , according to eq.([pair ] ) , the threshold for the creation of a soliton - antisoliton pair is , @xmath48 to be of the order of unity , we obtain the average density of kinks : @xmath49 the condition @xmath50 ensures that the typical value of @xmath51 is large enough to stabilize a soliton - antisoliton pair . </S>",
    "<S> the probability to find such a pair with separation much smaller than the average given by eq.([answer ] ) , is suppressed ( cf .  </S>",
    "<S> eq.([p ] ) ) as it requires a large disorder fluctuation . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> lattice configurations in which the average distance between the kinks is significantly larger than @xmath46 given by eq.([answer ] ) are statistically less likely . </S>",
    "<S> similar arguments were used to estimate the typical domain size for the ising model in a random magnetic field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the analogy is not accidental : it can be shown that the statistical properties of the disorder - induced kinks are indeed described by the latter model .    </S>",
    "<S> we next address the question whether our first - order expansion around multi - kink configurations is a meaningful approach . </S>",
    "<S> first , we estimate second - order effects . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , we again consider the fluctuation with spatial size @xmath46 and magnitude @xmath52 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the ratio @xmath53 of the second- and first - order corrections to the total energy can be expressed in terms of the renormalized frequency of the phonon with wave - vector @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> this frequency can be calculated in the two limiting cases for the on - site electron - electron interaction @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> we then find : @xmath56 plus higher order terms in powers of @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our approach is valid as long as the average distance between the kinks is much larger than the correlation length ( dilute gas of kinks ) .    </S>",
    "<S> second , we should stress that , although the energies of the multi - kink configurations are calculated perturbatively , the stabilization of kinks by weak disorder is clearly a non - perturbative effect . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that for growing disorder the minimal - energy lattice configuration with a finite density of kinks does not evolve continuously from the uniformly dimerized configuration . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , as long as the second - order correction to the energy due to disorder is relatively small , each multikink lattice configuration does not change much in the presence of weak disorder . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , their energies , even in the linear regime , may change appreciably for sufficiently long chains . </S>",
    "<S> this fact is illustrated in fig .  2 , where we plot the energies of several multi - kink configurations , with 0 to 4 soliton - antisoliton pairs , as a function of the magnitude of the disorder . here </S>",
    "<S> , the shape of the disorder fluctuation is assumed to be fixed , and the slopes of the plotted lines depend on the particular choice of the kink positions . from this figure </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the increase of the number of soliton - antisoliton pairs in the minimal - energy configuration for a given shape of the disorder fluctuation occurs discontinously in the region where the energies are still linear in the disorder .    </S>",
    "<S> elsewhere , we show in detail that the estimate for the density of disorder - induced kinks eq.([answer ] ) is , in fact , the exact result in the limit where the average distance between kinks is much larger than the correlation length @xmath58 ( dilute gas of kinks ) and much smaller than the length of the chain @xmath59 . the exact solution was obtained by noticing that the disorder averaged free energy of the chain at sufficiently low temperature has the form of a matrix element of the green function describing the relaxation of a spin-@xmath29 in a random magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the coordinate along the chain plays the role of the ( imaginary ) time in which the relaxation takes place , while the kinks correspond to spin - flips . </S>",
    "<S> the green function was found by solving the corresponding fokker - planck equation .    </S>",
    "<S> we now discuss the consequences of the disorder - induced solitons for the optical and magnetic properties . in the absence of electron - electron interactions , </S>",
    "<S> the finite density of kinks leads to the appearance of a peak in the single - particle density of states at @xmath60 , because each kink carries an electron state with zero energy @xcite . at weak disorder </S>",
    "<S> this peak is sharp since the distances between the kinks are large , so that the splitting of the energies of the electron states localized near different kinks due to their mutual interaction is very small ( @xmath61 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the peak in the density of states should result in a midgap peak in the optical absorption spectrum . in undoped trans - polyacetylene , however , this peak is not observed . </S>",
    "<S> this can be ascribed to a small magnitude of disorder , which is , however , unlikely , since the average ( presumably disorder limited ) conjugation length of trans - polyacetylene is known to be of the order of several tens of carbon atoms @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the on - site coulomb repulsion decreases the neutral soliton energy@xcite ( @xmath62 ) , thus increasing the kink density ( eq.([answer ] ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , at the same time , the coulomb interaction shifts the absorption peak resulting from the neutral kinks towards higher energies , where it may merge with the peak resulting from interband transitions . </S>",
    "<S> this may explain the absence of a clear midgap peak in the absorption spectrum , but it does not reconcile the theory with magnetic measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the neutral disorder - induced kinks have spin @xmath63 and should contribute to the magnetic susceptibility . </S>",
    "<S> however , the observed curie susceptibility for undoped trans - polyacetylene corresponds to only one free spin per 3000 carbon atoms @xcite , which is much smaller than the average density of kinks given by eq.([answer ] ) for the disorder magnitude used in @xcite to fit the absorption spectrum .    </S>",
    "<S> this contradiction between theory and experiment clearly poses questions as to the applicability of the ssh or the peierls - hubbard models to trans - polyacetylene . </S>",
    "<S> here we note several factors that may solve this problem . </S>",
    "<S> first , interchain interactions counteract the formation of free kinks , binding them into pairs . </S>",
    "<S> second , quantum lattice motion induces an effective interaction between the spins of neighbouring solitons , resulting in a spin - liquid with a singlet ground state . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the free spins of solitons can be bound by chemical impurities . </S>",
    "<S> further research is needed to see whether the quantitative effects of these factors are strong enough to account for the strong reduction in the number of observed free spins .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that in peierls chains arbitrarily weak off - diagonal disorder induces a finite density of neutral solitons . </S>",
    "<S> as we discussed , these solitons strongly affect the observable properties of the chains . </S>",
    "<S> we believe , that they also play an important role in the phase transition of disordered materials into the peierls state .    </S>",
