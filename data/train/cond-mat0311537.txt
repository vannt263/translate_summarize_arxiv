    "the discovery of unconventional high - temperature superconductivity by bednorz and mller@xcite in 1986 took many in the community by surprise .",
    "subsequent developments and some of the initial confusions are documented in the textbook by enz.@xcite among many others , anderson@xcite pointed out in 1987 that high-@xmath1 superconductivity should be understood in terms of a competition between a mott insulating state in the limit of zero hole doping and a superconducting state at optimal doping . meanwhile ,",
    "experimental evidence for the d - wave nature of high-@xmath1 superconductivity was found,@xcite and general features of the phase diagram were established.@xcite however , the nature of the pseudogap phase is still being debated .",
    "however , now there is increasing consensus that this regime can be described by in terms of a d - density - wave.@xcite    recently , laughlin proposed a very intuitive formulation regarding how to deal with superconductors close to a mott insulating state .",
    "this  gossamer superconductivity \" is characterized by a very small superfluid density and spectral weight of the superconducting quasiparticles .",
    "@xcite in this contribution , we will apply laughlin s idea to a more general situation : unconventional superconductivity in the presence of unconventional density wave ( udw ) order .",
    "more precisely , for high-@xmath1 cuprates we study d - wave superconductivity in the presence of a d - density wave .",
    "@xcite this could either be a charge density wave or a spin density wave order parameter , although the distinction between these two possibilities is not of importance for the following discussion . here",
    ", we wish to examine whether some features of the pseudogap phase can follow from the proposed model , as it was suggested by tallon and loram@xcite based on a phenomenological approach .",
    "furthermore , the recently observed weakening of superconductivity in the @xmath2 salts when the sample is rapidly cooled may be interpretetd within the model we are presenting in this paper .",
    "@xcite    when both the superconductivity and the density wave are conventional , this competition is not of great interest as long as the system can be reduced to a single band or a single fermi surface . in this case",
    ", there is typically little room for coexistence , and one of the order parameters , usually the superconductivity , dominates over the the other one.@xcite a similar statement holds if only one of the two competing order parameters is conventional .",
    "however , the situation changes completely when two unconventional order parameters are considered @xcite .",
    "if we look at heavy fermion systems and organic superconductors , we see signs for gossamer superconductivity almost everywhere , for example in cecu@xmath3si@xmath3 @xcite , uru@xmath3si@xmath3 @xcite , upd@xmath3al@xmath4 , cerhin@xmath5 , cecoin@xmath5 @xcite , and the @xmath6-(et)@xmath3 salts @xcite . therefore gossamer superconductivity",
    "as defined above may be a pervading feature in high-@xmath1 cuprates , heavy fermion superconductors and organic superconductors .    here , we report calculations for nodal superconductivity in the presence of nodal density wave order . for simplicity , we limit ourselves to quasi - two - dimensional systems with cylindrical fermi surfaces .",
    "we denote the superconducting and density wave order parameters by @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively , with angular dependence @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the maximum values of the corresponding order parameters .",
    "further , we limit ourselves to @xmath13 ( i.e. @xmath14-wave ) while for @xmath15 we consider the two cases ( a ) @xmath16 and ( b ) @xmath17 .",
    "the first case describes many features of the superconductivity in the pseudogap phase in high-@xmath18 cuprates , while we conjecture that the second case applies for the glassy phase of @xmath6-(et)@xmath3x with x = cu[n(cn)@xmath3]br .",
    "let us consider a one - band quasi - two - dimensional fermi surface where a nodal superconductor and a nodal density wave coexist . as a model hamiltonian we can think of a generalized hubbard model @xcite .",
    "the green function is given in @xmath20 spinor space as @xmath21 where the pauli matrices @xmath22 and @xmath23 are operating on the particle - hole space and the @xmath24 and @xmath25 space , respectively , where @xmath26 is the nesting vector for the nodal density wave .",
    "we have assumed here that the udw is a charge density wave .",
    "the green function possesses poles at the quasiparticle energies @xmath27 which is well known in the literature .",
    "@xcite here , @xmath28 is the imperfect nesting term .",
    "less well - known , perhaps , is the quasiparticle density of states ( dos ) given by    @xmath29    where the sum has to be taken over the two terms with @xmath30 . here , @xmath31 denotes the angular average over @xmath32 . in the limit @xmath33",
    "this expression reduces to a very familiar form @xmath34 in particular , for case ( a ) when @xmath35 we have @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind .",
    "this has the same form as in @xmath39-wave superconductors,@xcite with the only exception that the @xmath39-wave gap has to be replaced by the total gap @xmath40 . on the other hand , for case ( b ) when @xmath41 and @xmath17 the dos develops a complete gap below @xmath42 and we find @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",
    "here we have assumed @xmath45 . the corresponding dos with @xmath46 0.1 , 0.3 , and 0.5",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "except for the opening of the energy gap with increasing @xmath11 , the dos looks very similar to the case of @xmath11 = 0 , with a characteristic logarithmic singularity at @xmath47 .    , and ( b ) with @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=245 ] , and ( b ) with @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=245 ]    as we shall see in the following , for case ( a ) a non - vanishing @xmath28 is crucial for the presence of two order parameters . in fig .",
    "1(a ) we show the corresponding dos for the choices @xmath11 = 0 ( @xmath50 ) , @xmath11 = 0.1@xmath12 ( @xmath51 ) , and @xmath11 = 0.3@xmath12 ( @xmath52 ) . due to the presence of two order parameters , the logarithmic singularity at @xmath47",
    "splits into two singularities , which are now located at @xmath53 .",
    "we expect this double - peak structure to be accessible to scanning tunneling microscope measurements in the pseudogap phase of the high-@xmath1 cuprates .    very recently ,",
    "new measurements of the dos in underdoped bi2212 were reported.@xcite indeed , they show a clear double - peak structure . unfortunately , it was pointed out later that the secondary peak is a likely artifact of the heating process.@xcite however , based on the present model calculation we conclude that a second peak should indeed be visible in a careful experiment .",
    "for case ( a ) with @xmath54 , the gap equations are given by @xmath55 for @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively . here , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the dimensionless coupling constants for superconductivity and density wave .",
    "also , it is assumed here that @xmath58 , because otherwise there is no chance for the udw to occur .",
    "furthermore , for the survival of a finite superconducting component we also need @xmath59 .",
    "then , for small @xmath28 one finds @xmath60 , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the corresponding order parameters in the zero - temperature limit .",
    "moreover , for the energy gap that can be observed by scanning tunneling microscopy we find at low temperatures @xmath63 .",
    "thus , in the limit @xmath64 and @xmath65 , scanning tunneling microscopy will still identify @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , the puzzling result that the detected gap @xmath66 , where @xmath1 is the transition temperature of the pseudogap phase , can be naturally interpreted in terms of a d - density wave.@xcite finally , since the corresponding superfluid density at zero - temperature is given by @xmath67 there should be a substantial reduction of this quantity in the coexistence regime .    for the case ( b ) where @xmath68",
    "the gap equations are now given by @xmath69 in contrast to case ( a ) , here we always encounter coexistence of two order parameters , even when @xmath70 .",
    "in particular , for the case @xmath70 , eqs . 10 and 11",
    "can be solved at zero temperature .",
    "\\\\ \\frac{\\delta_2 ( 0 ) - \\delta_1 ( 0)}{\\delta_2 ( 0 ) + \\delta_1 ( 0 ) } & = & \\lambda_1^{-1 } - \\lambda_2^{-1 } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are cut - off energies .",
    "furthermore , the zero - temperature superfluid density is given by @xmath74 although the superfluid density is reduced in the present case , the reduction is not as severe as it is for case ( a ) .",
    "in this paper , we have analyzed the properties of a nodal superconductor in the presence of a nodal density wave .",
    "our preliminary results look very consistent with experimental observations that have been reported for the pseudogap region of the high-@xmath1 cuprates .",
    "for example , in contrast to the large quasiparticle energy gap observed by scanning tunneling microscopy , the corresponding superfluid density and the specific heat associated with superconductivity are much reduced.@xcite the present model calculation appears to describe these features consistently , although more measurements on this issue are clearly necessary .",
    "the application of this model to other potential  gossamer superconductors \" is promising .",
