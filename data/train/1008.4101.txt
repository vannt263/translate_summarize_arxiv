    "h  i emission lines are one of the defining characteristics of the classification of pre - main - sequence sun - like sources known at t tauri stars ( tts ) . still in the midst of formation , the less evolved tts , known as classical tts ( ctts ) , are surrounded by optically thick disks of gas and dust . in most cases , these young pre - main - sequence stars are still interacting with and accreting matter from the innermost regions of their disks via stellar magnetic fields . in this magnetospheric accretion paradigm , the stellar magnetosphere guides disk material from the inner disk onto the stellar surface through magnetic channels .",
    "the gas travels along these channels or so - called accretion columns near free - fall velocities , terminating in an accretion shock at the stellar surface .",
    "it is generally accepted that the gas is heated and ionized prior to and after reaching the stellar surface and that the characteristic h  i emission lines result , in part , from recombining and accreting hydrogen gas confined to these magnetic channels @xcite .",
    "balmer h@xmath2 emission is the dominant h  i feature present in the optical spectra of ctts , and the emission line strength ( or line width ) is often invoked as a measure of accretion rates for these sources @xcite .",
    "spatially resolved observations of h@xmath2 emission lines in these young stellar objects ( ysos ) also show it to be a strong component of the optical line emission from outflows , indicating that the underlying stimulation mechanisms for the h  i lines is likely to be a combination of phenomena .",
    "magnetospheric accretion models can successfully reproduce many aspects of the h  i emission features detected in the spectra of young stars .",
    "however , they notably fail to account for the highest velocity gas in the h  i line wings @xcite .",
    "spectro - astrometric observations of the pa@xmath3 emission feature in the ctts dg  tau show that the high velocity blue - shifted gas ( @xmath4  @xmath5  -200  km  s@xmath6 ) is extended in the same direction as [ fe  ii ] at 1.644  @xmath7 m , a forbidden emission line feature that traces the known outflow in the dg  tau system .",
    "this illustrates why a model producing h  i emission from accretion funnels does not account for high velocity gas forming the h  i line wings @xcite . while the high velocity gas is spatially shifted by as much as 0.@xmath85 around dg tau ( or @xmath1  70  au at the distance of taurus - auriga ) , the majority of the pa@xmath3 emission remains coincident with the source .",
    "although these results demonstrate that there are multiple processes for stimulating h  i emission lines , the bulk of the emitting gas does seem to arise from radii within 14  au of the central source constraining the emission to the magnetospheric accretion columns , inner gaseous disk , and the base of disk winds and outflows .    in the infrared , br@xmath0 ( 2.16  @xmath7 m ) emission serves as a surrogate for h@xmath2 as a signpost for circumstellar disk accretion in tts @xcite .",
    "br@xmath0 line luminosities appear to correlate with mass accretion luminosity in brown dwarfs , ctts , and herbig ae / be stars ( haebes ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , br@xmath0 and other lines in the infrared are less affected by optical depth effects that have proven problematic for using balmer series lines to infer temperatures , densities , and geometries of the emitting gas .",
    "historically , the problem of predicting the spectra emerging from a recombining hydrogen gas has been divided in to two distinct cases , a and b @xcite .",
    "case a theory applies to very low density gases that are optically thin to all transitions of the hydrogen atom , including the ultraviolet photons associated with the lyman series transitions .",
    "case b theory , which applies to higher density gases which are optically thick to uv photons but optically thin to all n @xmath9 2 transitions , is often applied to the environments of t tauri stars . in a case",
    "b model of a recombining atomic hydrogen gas , br@xmath0 is @xmath10.8 - 1% of the flux of h@xmath2 for a wide range of densities and temperatures ( 10@xmath10 @xmath11 n@xmath12 @xmath11 10@xmath13  @xmath14 , 5000k @xmath11 @xmath15 @xmath11 20000k ) .",
    "h@xmath2 is known to be a strong component in optical line emission from yso outflows @xcite , it seems natural that a corresponding component of the br@xmath0 emission would also arise from the outflows . yet , to date , there has been little evidence in the literature for spatially resolved br@xmath0 emission in the vicinity of ysos , and hence nearly all br@xmath0 emission is assumed to arise from magnetospheric processes within the inner accretion zone .",
    "in fact , infrared interferometric observations of haebe stars reveal that the br@xmath0 often arises from very compact locations within the dust sublimation radius of the circumstellar disk @xcite .",
    "though , a small extended br@xmath0 emission component can not be ruled out based on these observations .",
    "further interferometric and spectro - astrometric programs that seek to reveal the inner @xmath11 au environments show that the compact br@xmath0 is not always well modeled by disk emission alone @xcite .",
    "the analysis implies that a non - negligible component from outflowing gas needs to be incorporated into the models to explain the br@xmath0 emission structure .    as an extension of the spectro - astrometric and interferometric studies mentioned above",
    ", imaging spectroscopy of these tts can provide us with considerable insight into the geometric distribution of h  i emitting gas in accreting systems .",
    "three - dimensional imaging spectroscopy techniques can help to disentangle the respective contributions to the h  i emission features . with just one pointing of a telescope , imaging spectroscopy with integral field units ( ifus ) can provide three - dimensional x , y , @xmath16 datacubes at high spatial resolution with simultaneous coverage of many emission lines of interest .",
    "there has recently been an increase in the capabilities for adaptive optics ( ao ) fed near ir integral field spectroscopy at 8 - 10 meter class observatories @xcite .",

    "the data sets for this study were acquired for commissioning and system verification of nifs in october 2005 and february 2006 , gto time in december 2006 , and in queue mode in february 2007 ( see table  1 ) . for each observation , a standard set of calibrations",
    "were acquired using the gemini facility calibration unit , gcal .",

    "the cw  tau and haro  6 - 10 data were processed in a similar manner to all other data , as described above and in @xcite .",
    "all or part of the data for each source in this project was observed during photometric conditions and were flux calibrated using k - band magnitudes estimated by comparison to the brightness of the a0 standard star used for telluric correction . with the exception of haro 6 - 10 , the derived fluxes of the systems ( combined in the case of multiples ) were within 10 - 15% of published or 2mass magnitudes .",
    "for haro  6 - 10 , the nifs ifu spectra were compared to infrared k - band images acquired nearby in time for a complimentary project , the difference in flux was less than 0.2 magnitudes between the two observations .",

    "the clear detection of spatially extended emission from the haro  6 - 10  s jet prompted us to take a closer look at the br@xmath0 emission in all tts for which k - band ifu spectra had been obtained .",

    "* ) is at odds with the relative brightnesses of the lobes of the scattered light edge - on disk reflection nebula associated with this source .",
    "the southwestern lobe of the hv tau c scattered light nebula is brighter , and was thus thought to be associated with the blue - shifted ( closer ) lobe of the outflow .",

    "these curves were derived for each source by calculating the mean flux within 0.@xmath808 wide pixel annuli from the central stellar position and computing the standard deviation from the mean .",
    "this standard deviation of continuum subtracted line emission provides a measure of the uncertainty in the subtraction process , and thus can be used to gauge the s / n of the spatially extended line emission .",
    "though , the continuum subtracted plots do have the extended br@xmath0 flux included within the field .",
    "as a result , the measured standard deviations in the spatial bins with appreciable br@xmath0 flux are correspondingly higher , and the accuracy of the subtraction process is thus under - estimated .",
    "overplotted in each of the four panels is a dashed line that shows the magnitude of the point - source subtracted br@xmath0 flux with increasing distance from the central stellar position .",
    "comparison of the dashed curve with the solid curve provides an estimate of the measured s / n of the extended br@xmath0 emission .",

    "this result is seemingly at odds with the proposition that xz  tau  a is the more actively accreting star and the main driving source of the herbig - haro flow associated with this system @xcite although rw  aur exhibits very strong , centralized br@xmath0 emission flux , rw  aur  b showed no measurable br@xmath0 emission associated with stellar mass accretion from its circumstellar disk .",
    "the central region of br@xmath0 emission for t  tau  n was saturated in the data , making a proper measurement of the continuum subtracted br@xmath0 flux and point - source subtracted flux difficult .",
    "the surrounding spatial and spectral regions nearby are not saturated , and were used to estimate the 2.16  @xmath7 m flux level based on the shape of the psf .",
    "a cursory fitting analysis done at velocities on and off of the emission line using the a 0 spectral type telluric calibrator as a psf reference showed that the br@xmath0 emission associated with t  tau  n is not appreciably extended compared to the point - source continuum emission .",
    "the line emission is asymmetric around the t  tau  s psf , and is brighter to the northwest at the location of t  tau  sb .",
    "hence , the br@xmath0 line emission associated with the nearby 0@xmath251 t  tau  s a+b binary seems to arise preferentially from the @xmath26 component , and it is stronger than the continuum flux ( i.e. , the t tau sb / sa flux ratio is greater in br@xmath0 ) .",
    "this causes the apparent enhancement in br@xmath0 emission at the position of the companion in figure  7b .",
    "extraction of the individual spectra of the blended components was not done because of the saturation of t  tau  n , which would need to serve as a psf calibrator .",
    "@xcite showed that the br@xmath0 line luminosity from young stars correlates with the mass accretion rate , as determined from uv excess emission .",

    "the flux extraction volumes were chosen to be the same , so the difference in the atomic hydrogen outflow masses between the two stars is determined by the difference in their detected br@xmath0 flux values .",
    "having chosen the flux extraction volumes to correspond to the average @xmath42 proper motions of these jets , these estimates approximate the mass outflow rates for dg  tau and haro  6 - 10  s in solar masses per year .",
    "based on this analysis , we derive average electron densities on the order of a few @xmath2010@xmath39  @xmath14 for the dg  tau and haro  6 - 10  s outflows .",
    "these densities are consistent with the large values of 10@xmath39 to 10@xmath13  @xmath14 for n@xmath12 that are often found within the inner one hundred au regions of young star outflows derived by inspecting [ fe ii ] and other forbidden emission species @xcite .",
    "these electron densities are also very consistent with past values found in the inner dg  tau high velocity blue - shifted jet @xcite .",
    "the hydrogen outflow rates of 1.2@xmath2010@xmath31  m@xmath29  yr@xmath6 for dg  tau and 1.4@xmath2010@xmath31  m@xmath29  yr@xmath6 for haro  6 - 10  s represent lower limits for the true mass outflow levels derived in this manner .",
    "these mass outflow rates are underestimates of the true mass flow because only the fraction of the gas that has recently been heated by the shock radiates in the emission species that is studied .",
    "we also only detect the gas in the high velocity component of the outflow , not in lower velocity flow surrounding the jet axis @xcite .",
    "moreover , the derived br@xmath0 flux in the outflowing volume was not corrected for any line of sight extinction effects which might further serve to increase the derived mass outflow rate , particularly in the obscured class  i star , haro  6 - 10  s. thus , we predict that the true @xmath43 values are greater than 1.2@xmath2010@xmath31m@xmath29  yr@xmath6 for dg  tau and more than 1.4@xmath2010@xmath31m@xmath29  yr@xmath6 for haro  6 - 10  s.",

    "we detect spatially resolved br@xmath0 from dg  tau , haro  6 - 10  s , hl  tau and hv  tau  c , which represents 50% of the tts systems in our sample .",
    "we do not spatially resolve br@xmath0 line emission in the environments of xz  tau , rw  aur , t  tau and cw  tau .",
    "two stars within these latter systems , rw  aur  b and xz  tau  a , exhibit no br@xmath0 emission at all .    in two of the blue - shifted velocity channels ,",
    "the spatially extended br@xmath0 from haro  6 - 10  s makes up @xmath120% of the total spatially integrated line flux .",
    "integrated over the whole velocity width , about 10@xmath232% of the br@xmath0 emission from haro  6 - 10  s is spatially resolved at distances of greater than 0.@xmath81 ( 14 au ) in the extended outflow ( entirely from the blue - shifted velocity component ) .",
    "the spatially extended br@xmath0 emission makes up @xmath12% of the total line flux for dg  tau .",
    "all of the detected br@xmath0 flux seems to arise from the outflow for hv  tau  c , but the star is not seen directly because the continuum flux is measured only from the scattered light nebulosity .",
    "the inner magnetospheric accretion region of hv  tau  c may be shielded by the inner rim of the central circumstellar dust disk in our edge - on viewing orientation , hence in this case we might not see the strong central br@xmath0 component in the scattered light nebulosity .",
    "hl  tau has considerable br@xmath0 emission scattered off of its surrounding outflow cavity walls , and the fraction of spatially extended br@xmath0 emission is estimated to be 18@xmath237% of the line flux from the central position .",
    "observations of hl  tau were acquired with an occulting disk in the beam , so the total point source flux is estimated from the psf shape in the target acquisition setup images and the resulting value is significantly less certain .    the majority of the integrated br@xmath0 flux that we measure is spatially unresolved from the position of the central stellar sources in our data , with the noted exception of the edge - on disk system hv  tau  c. nifs data can spatially resolve the bright br@xmath0 emission beyond @xmath10.@xmath81 from the star , or about @xmath114  au .",
    "additional br@xmath0 emission likely arises from the outflows in regions closer than our resolution limit , where it can not be detected .",
    "overall , the extended br@xmath0 line emission that we detect beyond @xmath114  au distances from the parent stars comprises anywhere from a few percent ( dg  tau ) to all of the detected line flux from these systems ( hv  tau  c ) .",
    "all of the sources that we have studied here are known to drive herbig - haro outflows .",
    "it is not clear why some stars exhibit extended br@xmath0 emission , while other sources with strong and collimated outflows do not .",
    "however , from information presented in table  2 , we see that the stars that have appreciable spatially extended br@xmath0 emission also have stronger estimated levels of optical visual extinction , a@xmath44 , toward the stellar photosphere .",
    "the stars where we do not find extended br@xmath0 emission all have lower estimated optical obscurations . in the systems where extended br@xmath0 emission is seen ,",
    "the stronger levels of stellar continuum flux attenuation from the high visual extinction may make the weak spatially extended emission easier to detect .",
    "the stars that do not exhibit extended br @xmath0 emission have brighter stellar continuum flux , which may be a result of less obscuration by natal material because of a slightly older evolutionary state , or a perhaps a more inclined viewing geometry that directly reveals more of the central photosphere of the star .",
    "thus , spatially extended br@xmath0 emission may exist toward the other stars , but the bright continuum flux might prevent us from detecting it .",
    "several recent spectro - astrometric and interferometric investigations of inner yso disks have sought to spatially resolve the atomic hydrogen associated with the magnetospheric recombination regions within 1  au from the target stars @xcite .",
    "the spectro - astrometric study of @xcite revealed that an appreciable amount of pa@xmath3 emission from the blue and red - shifted velocity profiles arises from spatially extended distances from a tts .",
    "three of their four targets exhibited spatially resolved pa@xmath3 emission , two revealed evidence for spatially extended bi - polar red and blue - shifted components .",
    "this is an important finding , since the broadened emission line wings seen in the h  i profiles from ctts have never been well explained by magnetospheric accretion models .",
    "evidence from this pa@xmath3 study and now our br@xmath0 project suggest that the h  i emission from tts does have non - negligible components from the outflow on spatial scales that were unresolvable prior to the current generation of sensitive instrumentation on 8 - 10 meter class telescopes .    thus far",
    ", spectro - interferometric studies of br@xmath0 that can spatially resolve the inner magnetospheric accretion region have largely concentrated on the brighter herbig ae / be stars ( haebes ; @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , most interferometric data reveals that the br@xmath0 emission surrounding the haebes arises from a centralized location that is spatially more compact than the infrared continuum emission , with perhaps some contribution from an outflowing wind @xcite .",
    "the compact h  i likely arises predominantly from the accretion - driven processes within the star - disk boundary ; either from the central stellar mass accretion engine or from a stellar or disk wind @xcite .",
    "further work is warranted to better reveal the central emission location of h  i from ttss , and the fraction of h  i emission that is truly spatially extended from the parent star in comparison to the higher mass haebes .",
    "although we do detect spatially extended br@xmath0 emission from 50% of our sample targets , the bulk of the line emission from most stars does arise within @xmath114  au from the central unresolved point sources .",
    "while the spatially extended h  i seems to affect the wings of the velocity line profile shapes @xcite , it is likely that the majority of the low velocity h  i is emitted via magnetospheric processes in the central disk - star accretion region .",
    "@xcite presented a large - scale multi - epoch near - infrared spectroscopic survey of 15 actively accreting tts in taurus - auriga .",
    "they compared the h  i line ratios of 16 paschen and brackett series emission features and found little variations in these ratios from epoch to epoch and from source to source .",
    "for the first time , a statistically significant correlation was found between the observed h  i line ratios in tts systems and those predicted by case  b line recombination theory @xcite for a tightly constrained gas temperature and electron density . while the range of electron densities bary et al .",
    "find for the emitting h  i gas agrees with that predicted by magnetospheric accretion models , the temperatures are substantially lower than expected for accreting gas  @xmath11  2000  k and 10@xmath45  @xmath14  @xmath11  @xmath46  @xmath18  10@xmath47  @xmath14 . ] .",
    "these results suggest that the emission is from a recombining gas not in local thermodynamic equilibrium and is instead being stimulated by a non - thermal process .",
    "in addition , these results may also suggest a combination of emission sources for the emitting h  i gas in the central regions and that the observed h  i line fluxes are a superposition of emitting gas with different physical conditions .",
    "as such , one might not necessarily expect a linear correlation between detected br@xmath0 flux from the central star and the liberated accretion luminosity measured from the uv excess emission , as found by @xcite .",
    "however , the correlation does exist and the mass accretion rates we derived from our measured br@xmath0 line fluxes are consistent with those found in past studies of tts . taken in combination",
    ", these results further confirm the connection between accretion and outflow activity .",
    "deriving accurate mass outflow values is notoriously difficult .",
    "this is in part because the emission line regions in outflows measure only material in the post - shock area of a jet and do not sample outflow material ahead of the shock .",
    "shocks from outflows and their associated optical and infrared emission lines are obvious observational manifestations of mass outflow activity , but they are the result of fast material plowing into slower clumps of gas in the outflow path . hence , material can ( and does ) exist in the outflow without these detectable emission features if there is no slower material in the flow path to cause the shock . methods described in the literature for measuring mass outflow rates from classical ttss rely largely on measuring the mass flux from forbidden emission line species and converting this to an outflow rate based on estimates of the gas ionization fraction @xcite .",
    "the different observational techniques derive mass outflow to mass accretion ratios in the range of 1 to 10% .",
    "in some cases , multi - wavelength or emission line studies of the same system find @xmath43/@xmath27 values that differ by factors of @xmath110 , even for the same system ( e.g. , dg  tau , see below ) .",
    "measurement of mass outflow rates using atomic hydrogen emission species has been difficult in the past because of the strong optical depth effects in optical balmer emission species .",
    "the infrared brackett features are less optically thick , and may serve as a more robust tracer of the atomic hydrogen gas mass in the young star outflows .    in the previous section , we derived the first masses of ionized hydrogen using br@xmath0 emission for the dg  tau and haro  6 - 10  s outflows .",
    "comparison of the mass accretion rates with our derived atomic hydrogen mass outflow rates for dg  tau and haro  6 - 10  s ( see table  2 ) reveals that the outflowing h  i mass is estimated at @xmath110 - 15% of the mass accreting onto the central star .",
    "moreover , our derived mass outflow rates are also lower limits , implying that the actual ratio of @xmath43/@xmath27 may be larger than 10 - 15% for these two sources .",
    "these ratios are consistent with @xmath43/@xmath27 values predicted by the theory of mass accretion efficiency and magnetocentrifugal launching mechanisms ( i.e. , disk winds and accretion - driven stellar winds ) for young star outflows @xcite , and are on the high side in comparison with ratios found from other observational investigations @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that we find @xmath43/@xmath27 values for dg  tau and haro  6 - 10  s that seem in the high range compared to ratios derived from other observations .",
    "additionally , the @xmath43 rates we find are lower limits , as discussed in @xmath485 .",
    "however , the uncertainties in the derivation of both the @xmath43 and @xmath27 values can be very large .",
    "our lower limit for the value of m@xmath49 in dg  tau and haro  6 - 10  s is derived from straightforward assumptions on the physics of lte atomic hydrogen in recombination regions .",
    "as noted above , the hydrogen recombination emission area very close to the central star is possibly excited by non - thermal processes in the inner magnetospheric region @xcite .",
    "hence , it seems feasible that these non - lte conditions may extend into the inner regions of the outflow , making our h  ii - like analysis of hydrogen emitting mass correspondingly uncertain .",
    "this is likely one of the largest sources of uncertainty in our analysis , but it is also difficult to characterize .",
    "we also estimate an additional source of error in our selection of the emission volume that was chosen to represent one year worth of jet motion .",
    "moreover , the correlation of integrated br@xmath0 line luminosity with stellar mass accretion luminosity has an intrinsic scatter @xcite , and deviation in @xmath43/@xmath27 by a factor of several for a given target can result from using this method to derive the stellar mass accretion rate .",
    "multiple observations of accretion indicators from large sample of tts demonstrate the highly variable nature of accretion activity in these young stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the effects from intrinsic time variation in the accretion and outflow properties are not an issue in our study because the mass outflow and mass accretion rates are derived simultaneously from the same data set .",
    "the blue - shifted jet emerging from dg  tau is arguably one of the best studied outflows associated with a young star .",
    "it was among the first cttss for which a collimated jet - like outflow was discovered @xcite .",
    "since its discovery , the hh  158 outflow from dg  tau has been investigated with high spatial resolution imaging and spectroscopy with @xmath50 , ground - based adaptive optics systems , and spectro - imaging techniques @xcite .",
    "this outflow has observationally revealed the structure of collimated yso jets in great spatial detail ; they are typically comprised of an on - axis high velocity component ( hvc ) at radial velocities greater than @xmath150  km  s@xmath6 that can extend to spatial distances of hundreds of au from the star , and an encompassing shell of lower velocity gas that extends only about @xmath1100  au away from the central star @xcite . although he  i 10830 emission is commonly attributed only to stellar winds in the inner @xmath110 au environments of ctts , @xcite detect he  i 10830 emission from dg tau at the jet velocity , spatially extended over   0.5 arcsec ( @xmath170au ) of the jet , though their spectroastrometry did not find extension in the low - velocity he i 10830 emission . @xcite and @xcite described the blue - shifted hh  158 jet as having an  onion - skin \" structure , with high velocity low density gas on - axis , surrounded by successive layers of lower velocity , higher density gas .",
    "integrated over the width of the jet axis , the @xmath43/@xmath27 values derived for the dg  tau jet from past studies lie in the range of 0.05 - 0.1 @xcite , though most of these estimates use large mass accretion rate of @xmath110@xmath13 m@xmath29  yr@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "@xcite analyzed the kinematics of dg  tau s jet and found evidence for velocity asymmetries across the jet axis , and they interpret this result as evidence for rotation within the inner jet channel .",
    "this controversial finding challenges the theories of magnetospheric interaction at the inner star + disk + outflow boundary region .",
    "the outflow from dg  tau has served as a laboratory to test the physics of yso jets , so it is fitting that our first discovery of spatially extended br@xmath0 from cttss includes this system . in dg  tau , the spatially extended br@xmath0 emission that we detect arises from the high velocity , on - axis gas in the blue - shifted outflow .",
    "interestingly , this h  i coincides very closely in projected location with the recently discovered x - ray emission in the jet @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the blue - shifted outflow from dg  tau has emission from soft x - rays out to spatially extended distances of several hundred au from the central star .",
    "the temperatures of the soft x - ray emission regions associated with the extended x - ray jet are on the order of a few times 10@xmath13k .",
    "these temperatures pose a problem for understanding jet heating mechanisms .",
    "the standard jet shock models for yso outflows can not explain temperatures on the order of 10@xmath13k , and this argues strongly in favor of some form of non - thermal excitation of the gas ; for example by ohmic heating from magnetic dissipative currents @xcite .",
    "the detected br@xmath0 emission from the dg  tau blue - shifted outflow seems to correspond to gas nearby to these super - heated regions , and thus if strong magnetic fields significantly effect the physical conditions in the inner flows then our simple method of deriving @xmath43 assuming thermal case  b recombination of atomic hydrogen at temperatures of @xmath110@xmath39k would be correspondingly inaccurate . further tests and comparison of the physical conditions in br@xmath0 and x - ray emitting jets could help clarify the physics in the inner regions of the outflows .",
    "unfortunately , as previously mentioned , hl  tau , hv  tau  c and haro  6 - 10  s are class  i protostars or cttss with circumstellar disks viewed in a nearly edge - on configuration , and all three of these systems have very strong optical obscuration ( see table  2 ) .",
    "it is likely not feasible to detect the soft x - ray emission from these jets to further test the physical conditions of the br@xmath0 emission environments .",
    "we have presented the results of our k - band integral field spectroscopy study of the br@xmath0 line emission from eight t tauri star systems .",
    "the key points of our study are :    \\1 ) using adaptive optics fed integral field spectroscopy , we have spatially resolved br@xmath0 line emission in the circumstellar environments around four of our eight survey target stars : dg  tau , haro  6 - 10  s , hl  tau and hv  tau  c.    \\2 ) the spatially extended br@xmath0 emission arises predominantly from the hydrogen recombination regions associated with the inner herbig - haro outflows from these young stars .",
    "only hl  tau shows a significant contribution of stellar br@xmath0 emission scattered into our line of sight off of the outflow cavity walls .",

    "although we spatially resolve br@xmath0 emission from outflows in our high - contrast measurements , the majority of the integrated br@xmath0 from most systems is spatially unresolved and may arise from the magnetospheric accretion processes at the location of the central stellar source ( with the exception of hv  tau  c ) .",
