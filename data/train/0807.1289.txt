    "transforms are an important tool in the theory of ( ordinary and partial ) differential equations and in stochastic analysis . in probability theory",
    "the fourier transform of a random variable , which represents the characteristic function of the corresponding distribution , is widely used .",
    "fourier ( and laplace ) transforms have become increasingly popular in mathematical finance as well . on the one hand , for example , via a complex laplace transform and the convolution theorem one may derive pricing formulas for one dimensional european options ( e.g. , see @xcite ) . on the other hand , laplace and fourier transforms are known in closed form for many classes of processes .",
    "a famous example is the so - called lvy - khintchine formula which provides an explicit expression for the characteristic function of a lvy process .",
    "more recent financial literature goes well beyond lvy processes and attempts to establish explicit or semi - explicit formulas for derivatives where underlyings are modelled , for instance , by affine processes ( see among others @xcite,@xcite and @xcite ) or more general it - lvy processes ( e.g. see @xcite )",
    ". theoretical analysis of affine processes is done in the seminal paper by duffie , filipovi and schachermayer @xcite and has led to a unique characterization of affine processes .",
    "in particular , it is shown that the problem of determining the ( conditional ) fourier transform of an affine process @xmath0 corresponds to the problem of solving a system of generalized riccati differential equations in the time variable @xmath1 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "although closed form solutions of this system can be found in important cases , there is no generic approach to solve such a system in the general multi - dimensional case . in this article",
    "we establish some kind of functional series representation for the fourier transform , hence the characteristic function of the process under consideration and , in principle , for more general transforms .",
    "the most natural one is a taylor expansion in time @xmath1 around @xmath2 .",
    "this approach leads to expansions where the coefficients can be recursively computed without solving linear or non - linear differential equations as , for instance , in the case of the so called wkb expansions for transition densities ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , it turns out that in many cases the resulting power series converges only in @xmath3 this problem corresponds to a difficulty which is well known in semi - group theory and in the theory of parabolic differential equations : small time expansions for the solutions of parabolic equations are usually possible in a neighborhood of some @xmath4 while an expansion around @xmath2 may have zero convergence radius . in this paper",
    "we prove that for a generator with affine coefficients the fourier transform extends holomorphically into a disc around @xmath2 and a strip containing the positive real axes , under some mild regularity conditions .",
    "then , for multi - dimensional affine processes we obtain convergent expansions for the fourier transform and its logarithm on the whole time line .",
    "hence , we have ( affine ) series representations for the exponent of the characteristic function of a general multi - dimensional affine process .",
    "more generally , we develop a framework based on a concept of analytic vectors which allows for functional series expansions for a class of holomorphic transforms which covers the standard fourier transform .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "the basic setup is described in section  [ bs ] . in section [ avt ]",
    "we introduce the notion of analytic vectors associated with a given generator and study functional series expansions for the corresponding transform .",
    "section [ gena ] is devoted to the cauchy problem for affine generators . in section [ laff ]",
    "we derive series representations for the logarithm of the fourier transform corresponding to a generator with affine coefficients .",
    "section  [ ex ] gives an explicit representation for these expansions in a one - dimensional case .",
    "finally , section [ itolevy ] contains results for affine it - lvy processes which mainly follow from previous sections .",
    "more technical proofs are given in the appendix .",
    "let @xmath5 be a standard filtered probability space where the filtration @xmath6 satisfies ` the usual conditions ' . on this space we consider for each @xmath7 a compensated poisson random measure @xmath8 on @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a poisson random measure with ( deterministic ) intensity kernel of the form @xmath11 satisfying @xmath12 for any @xmath13 such that @xmath14 ( closure of @xmath15 ) .",

    "further , by assumption , the kernel @xmath22 satisfies,@xmath23 @xmath18 @xmath24 the function @xmath25 has bounded derivatives of any order .",
    "let us assume @xmath26 to be a standard brownian motion in @xmath27 living on our basic probability space , and consider the it - lvy sde : @xmath28 for deterministic functions @xmath29 @xmath30 which satisfy sufficient regularity and/or mutual consistency conditions such that ( [ itolev ] ) has a unique strong solution @xmath31 called an it - lvy process , which can be regarded as a strong markov process ( e.g. , see @xcite , @xcite ) .    as a well - known fact , the above process @xmath32 can be connected to some kind of evolution equation in a natural way . as a sufficient additional condition we may assume , for example , that the uniform ellipticity condition holds : there exists @xmath33 such that@xmath34 or , as another example , that @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 are affine in @xmath38 and satisfy the mutual admissibility conditions of @xcite in the framework of affine processes . in this context we consider a pseudo generator @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the space of continuous functions @xmath41 @xmath42 equipped with the topology of uniform convergence on compacta , and @xmath43 is the space of functions @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 which are two times continuously differentiable .",

    "the closure of @xmath54 is denoted by @xmath55 as such @xmath56 can be seen as a relaxation of the notion of a generator of a strongly continuous feller - dynkin semigroup associated with the process @xmath57 for which the hille - yosida theorem applies .",
    "this semigroup is usually defined on the banach space @xmath58 i.e. the set of continuous functions on @xmath59 which vanish at infinity , equipped with the supremum norm , and its generator coincides literally with @xmath54 on a dense subdomain of @xmath60 by slight abuse of terminology however , we will also refer to @xmath56 as generator when @xmath56 is considered in connection with the process @xmath32 given via ( [ itolev ] ) .",
    "let now @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath46 be a dense subset of bounded continuous functions @xmath64 which have bounded derivatives of any order . with respect to the ( closed ) generator ( [ cla ] ) we consider for each @xmath65 @xmath45 @xmath66 the ( generalized ) cauchy problem @xmath67 where @xmath68 is some open ( maximal ) domain , and assume that problem ( [ fbk1 ] ) has a unique solution .",
    "for instance , see @xcite for mild conditions which guarantee existence of unique global solutions of integro - differential evolution problems .",
    "in particular , if some ellipticity condition is satisfied we may have @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 for mixed type generators , such as affine generators , existence , uniqueness , and the maximal domain @xmath68 has to be considered case by case .",
    "for example , if @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 are affine in @xmath38 and satisfy the admissibility conditions in @xcite , existence and uniqueness are ensured in a domain of the form @xmath68",
    "@xmath69 @xmath71 ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "we underline , however , that in this article the main focus is on functional series representations for the solution of , and we therefore merely assume that sufficient regularity conditions for the coefficients in ( [ gen ] ) ( hence ( [ itolev ] ) ) are fulfilled .",

    "hence , since @xmath56 is closed,@xmath115    in order to study generalized transforms associated with a set of analytical vectors @xmath66 in domains containing the non - negative real axis we introduce for @xmath116 the sequence @xmath117 in ( [ qseq ] ) the coefficients @xmath118 @xmath119 are determined by the identity @xmath120 and are usually called unsigned stirling numbers of the first kind .",
