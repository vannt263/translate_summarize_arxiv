    "in recent few decades , the quantum information technology has developed with extremely high speed .",
    "experimental results demonstrate that the quantum communication and computation are much more efficient than their classical counterparts in many aspects . in almost all the practical quantum communication and computation tasks ,",
    "the maximally entangled quantum states may be the most important resources @xcite .",
    "for example , in the fields of quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum dense coding @xcite , quantum communication @xcite , and entanglement - based quantum key distribution @xcite , one needs to use the maximally entangled states to set up the quantum entanglement channel .",
    "however , the quality of the maximally entangled states are easily degraded , for the entangled particles may inevitably interact with the channel noise during the storage and transmission process .",
    "the maximally entangled state may degrade to the mixed state or less - entangled pure state , which can not set up the high quality quantum entanglement channel @xcite .",
    "therefore , in practical applications , we need to recover the mixed states or the less - entangled pure states into the maximally entangled ones .    entanglement concentration is an effective method for extracting the maximally entangled quantum states from less - entangled pure states @xcite . in 1996 , bennett _ et al . _",
    "proposed the first entanglement concentration protocol ( ecp ) , which is called the schmidt projection method @xcite .",
    "the ecp requires some collective and nondestructive measurements , which are difficult to realize under current experimental condition .",
    "after that , various ecps have been put forward , successively @xcite .",
    "for example , in 1999 , bose _",
    "proposed an ecp with entanglement swapping @xcite , which was improved by shi _",
    "_ in 2000 @xcite .",
    "in 2001 , zhao _ et al . _ and yamamoto _ et al . _ proposed two similar ecps , independently @xcite , in which the optical polarization beam splitters ( pbss ) are adopted to complete the parity check measurement for photons . in 2008 , sheng _",
    "_ adopt the cross - kerr nonlinearity to construct the quantum nondemolition detector , which makes the ecp can be used repeatedly to further concentrate the less - entangled state . in 2010 ,",
    "the ecp for single - photon entanglement was also proposed by sheng _",
    "so far , most ecps have focused on the single - photon and two - photon systems",
    ". only a few ecps deal with the multi - photon system , for its high operational complexity , .",
    "recently , the cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) have been proved to be a powerful platform for performing the qip tasks of the photon - atom states , due to the controllable interaction between atoms and photons @xcite . with the atoms strongly interacting with local cavities",
    ", the spatially separated cavities could serve as quantum nodes , and construct a quantum network assisted by the photons acting as a quantum bus @xcite . especially , during the past few years , available techniques have achieved the input - output process relevant to optical low - quality ( q ) cavities , such as the microtoroidal resonator ( mtr ) @xcite .",
    "it is attractive and applicable to combine the input - output process with low - q cavities , for it can accomplish high - quality qip tasks with currently available techniques . in 2009 ,",
    "an _ et al .",
    "_ showed that when a photon interacts with an atom trapped in a low - q cavity , different polarization of the input photon can cause different phase rotation of the output photon , which is called the photonic faraday rotation @xcite .",
    "the photonic faraday rotation only works in low - q cavities and is insensitive to both cavity decay and atomic spontaneous emission . in 2012 ,",
    "based on the photonic faraday rotation , peng _ et al .",
    "_ proposed an ecp for the multi - photon greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state @xcite , in which they can distill one pair of maximally entangled multi - photon ghz state from two pairs of less - entangled pure multi - photon ghz states with some probability .",
    "however , this ecp is not optimal , for after the concentration , one pair of less - entangled multi - photon state has to be wasted . in this paper",
    ", we will put forward an improved ecp for less - entangled multi - photon ghz state . in our protocol , we only require one pair of less - entangled multi - photon state , an auxiliary photon and a three - level atom trapped in the low - q cavity . with the help of the photonic faraday rotation , we can successfully distill the maximally entangled multi - photon ghz state with the same success probability as ref .",
    "moreover , our ecp can be used repeatedly to further concentrate the discarded items in ref .",
    "@xcite and obtain a higher success probability . especially , if we consider the practical operation and imperfect detection , our ecp is more powerful .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we first explain the basic principle of the photonic faraday rotation . in sec .",
    "iii , we explain our ecp for the less - entangled two - photon state . in sec .",

    "the state @xmath2 and @xmath0 couple with a left ( l ) polarized and a right ( r ) polarized photon , respectively.,width=302 ]    the photonic faraday rotation is the key element of our ecp . in this section , we will briefly explain the basic input - output relation for a single photon pulse coherently interacting with a trapped three - level atom . as shown in fig .",
    "1 , a three - level atom is trapped in a low - q cavity , where the state @xmath1 represents the excited state , and the states @xmath2 and @xmath0 represent two zeeman sublevels of the ground state , respectively . a single photon pulse with the form @xmath3 enters the low - q cavity and interacts coherently with the three - level atom .",

    "it indicates that if the single - photon pulse senses the empty cavity , the output photon state will convert to @xmath19 . on the other hand ,",
    "when the single photon couples to the three - level atom , as the photon experiences an extremely weak absorption during the photon - atom interaction process , we can consider that the output photon only experiences a pure phase shift without any absorption for a good approximation . in this way , with strong @xmath11 , weak @xmath12 and @xmath15 , eq .",

    "<S> a recent paper ( phys . rev . a * 86 * , 034305 ( 2012 ) ) proposed an entanglement concentration protocol ( ecp ) for distilling one pair of maximally entangled multi - photon greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state from two pairs of less - entangled multi - photon states with the photonic faraday rotation . in this paper , we put forward an improved ecp for arbitrary less - entangled multi - photon ghz state . in the ecp , we only require one pair of less - entangled multi - photon state and one auxiliary photon , and the whole concentration process only requires local operations . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , our ecp can be used repeatedly to further concentrate the less - entangled multi - photon state and obtain a higher success probability . if consider the practical operation and imperfect detection , our protocol is more efficient . </S>",
    "<S> this ecp may be useful in current quantum information processing . </S>"
