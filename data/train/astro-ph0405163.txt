    "type ia supernovae are one class of luminous stellar explosions .",
    "these are the predominant explosive events in old stellar environments such as elliptical galaxies .",
    "the ejecta of these objects are rich in intermediate mass and iron group elements . explaining the nature of these objects is therefore critical for understanding galactic chemical evolution @xcite .",
    "these supernovae also are the key component of one method used to determine the history of the universe and probe the origin of dark energy @xcite .    the work presented in this _ letter",
    "_ builds on many previous observational and theoretical contributions to the field of type ia sne , and on advances in fluid dynamics , nuclear physics , and computational science .",
    "current ideas about the type ia supernova explosion mechanism follow from the original work of arnett , nomoto , and khokhlov @xcite , who pioneered deflagrating and detonating massive white dwarfs originally proposed by @xcite as the core component of type ia supernovae .    despite decades of effort",
    ", these events remain an unsolved mystery .",
    "proposed explosion scenarios include white dwarf detonations @xcite , coalescing pairs of white dwarfs @xcite , deflagrations or delayed detonations of massive white dwarfs @xcite , and collapse in a strong gravitational field @xcite . none of these scenarios accounts for all the observed features of type ia supernovae .",
    "some models produce energetic explosions but fail to explain the observed ejecta compositions , while others successfully produce the observed chemically stratified ejecta but require including ad hoc physics .    here",
    "we report the results of multi - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of the long - term evolution of a massive white dwarf following an essentially central ignition .",
    "the initial evolution results in a deflagration front and formation of a rayleigh - taylor unstable buoyancy - driven bubble that is accelerated to supersonic speeds on its way to the stellar surface .",
    "we follow the evolution beyond bubble breakout and observe formation of gravitationally confined flow across the surface of the star .",
    "the flow is focused at the point opposite the breakout location , where the matter is compressed and heated , igniting a detonation wave just above the stellar surface .",
    "we find that the star expands substantially during the evolution .",
    "this expansion produces a density distribution that , when overrun by the detonation wave , can be expected to result in ejecta that are strongly layered and rich in intermediate mass elements , as is typical of type ia supernovae . the modest asymmetry in the expansion of the star",
    "can also be expected to produce a mild amount of global asymmetry in the explosion .",
    "the simulations presented here were performed with the adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamics code flash  @xcite .",
    "the numerical scheme includes self - gravity solved using a multipole expansion .",
    "we have established that to properly account for asymmetries in the mass distribution and to ensure momentum conservation in the model , at least @xmath0 multipole moments are needed in the expansion . in the simulations reported here , we used @xmath1 multipole moments .",
    "the rest of the physics modules are identical to those used in our previous study @xcite , in particular the evolution of the deflagration front is computed with a flame capturing scheme with energy release accounting for carbon , magnesium , and silicon burning @xcite .",
    "the computational domain is a two - dimensional region in cylindrical geometry covering a region from @xmath2  km to @xmath3  km in the z - direction and extending up to @xmath3  km in radius .",
    "we employed an outflow - only boundary condition at all domain boundaries , except along the symmetry axis at @xmath4 where we used a reflecting boundary condition .",
    "the adaptive mesh was used to track flow features at a maximum effective resolution of 8  km ( corresponding to an effective grid resolution of @xmath5 ) .",
    "the simulation was executed at courant number of @xmath6 , and the time step was limited to a maximum of @xmath7  s.    the initial conditions consist of a @xmath8 solar mass isothermal white dwarf composed of equal amounts of carbon and oxygen with a temperature of @xmath9k .",
    "the progenitor model was mapped to the computational grid following the procedure employed in @xcite .",
    "the nuclear flame was initiated as a small spherical region of completely burned material placed in hydrostatic equilibrium with its surroundings .",
    "the ignition region centered at @xmath10  km had a radius of @xmath11  km .",
    "figure [ f : density_sequence ] depicts several moments in the evolution of the density of the star from the point of bubble breakout to just prior to the ignition of the detonation .",
    "the rapid ascent of the bubble toward the stellar surface accelerates the stellar material located just above the bubble .",
    "this piston - like behavior results in the formation of a bulge filled with high - pressure high - momentum nuclear ash . during breakout ,",
    "bubble material is expelled mostly radially , while the high pressure of the burned material accelerates the surface layers laterally ( fig .",
    "[ f : density_sequence](a ) ) .",
    "this material races along the stellar surface , followed by the magnesium - rich bubble material . both remain gravitationally confined to a relatively thick @xmath12  km layer ( fig .",
    "[ f : density_sequence](b ) ) . at @xmath13",
    "s , this flood of surface material converges at the point opposite to the bubble breakout location , forming a conical compressed region bounded by the shock .",
    "this structure stretches down the symmetry axis beginning at @xmath14  cm ( fig .",
    "[ f : density_sequence](c ) ) .    at this point in the evolution ,",
    "conditions in the shocked region approach the detonation regime .",
    "by @xmath15  s , material upstream of the confluence region has density of @xmath16  g  @xmath17 and moves at velocity @xmath18  km  s@xmath19 .",
    "downstream of the shock , the density of the nuclear fuel is @xmath20  g  @xmath17 and the temperature reaches @xmath21  k. due to a mild density gradient present in the flooding material ( fig .",
    "[ f : detail](a ) ) ,        the post - shock density slowly increases with time while the temperature remains relatively constant . at @xmath22",
    "s , the post - shock conditions are suitable for igniting the nuclear fuel : the density exceeds @xmath23",
    "g  @xmath17 and the temperature is @xmath24  k. the detonation point can be seen as a slightly over - pressured region located near the symmetry axis at @xmath25 )  cm ( fig .",
    "[ f : detail](b ) ) .",
    "the detonation wave born in the region above the stellar radius will sweep through the white dwarf , which underwent a substantial evolution from the moment of the ignition of the deflagration . during its ascent ,",
    "the rising bubble displaced about 5% of the stellar mass .",
    "this mass displacement , combined with the pressure wave caused by nuclear energy release , leads to expansion of the star .",
    "thermal expansion is present from the onset of the deflagration with that part of the star nearest the deflagration experiencing relatively stronger thermal expansion .",
    "the global evolution of the stellar matter is , however , primarily in response to the softening of the gravitational potential caused by mass displacement .",
    "this expansion has a mostly radial character and becomes effective only after bubble breakout .",
    "figure [ f : mass_distribution ]    s after the deflagration began near the center of the star ) .",
    "the expansion velocity increases linearly from the stellar center and leads to a steady decrease in the density of the star at all radii . at the moment of the ignition of the detonation , almost half of the stellar mass has densities below @xmath26  g  @xmath17 .",
    ", width=302 ]    shows the evolution of density during the course of the simulation . shown is the amount of mass in several density intervals . the material with density @xmath27  g  @xmath17 will undergo burning to iron peak elements , while material with density below @xmath28  g  @xmath17 will burn into intermediate mass elements .",
    "several points can be noted here .",
    "there is almost no stellar expansion prior to the bubble breakout ( @xmath29  s ) .",
    "the breakout is followed by relatively fast expansion of the densest material ( @xmath30  g  @xmath17 ) , which is succeeded by uniform expansion ( identified by a simultaneous increase in the expansion rates at @xmath31  s ) .",
    "this process continues until the ignition of the detonation , with the most rapid expansion at densities between @xmath32  g  @xmath17 and @xmath26  g  @xmath17 . at the time of detonation",
    "the amount of mass at the densities characteristic for production of intermediate mass elements , @xmath33  g  @xmath17 , is 0.35  @xmath34 .",
    "the amount of mass at densities above @xmath26  g  @xmath17 , required for production of the iron peak elements , is 0.71  @xmath34 .",
    "we presented a gravitationally confined detonation ( gcd ) mechanism for type ia supernova explosions .",
    "the basic components of the proposed scenario are a rising deflagrating bubble expelling a small amount of stellar matter , the associated stellar expansion caused by the shallower potential well , the flood of stellar material across the surface following the bubble breakout , and a detonation in an gravitationally confined environment .    in the gcd scenario ,",
    "not imposing any asymmetries in the initial conditions is of paramount importance .",
    "a deflagration front is born very close to the white dwarf center .",
    "such an essentially central ignition is more probable than the idealized conditions adopted in standard deflagration or delayed detonation models , primarily because the central region of the star is convective .",
    "this type of ignition results in a rising deflagrating bubble accelerated by buoyancy to supersonic speeds on its way to the stellar surface .",
    "the transonic phase of the bubble s rise is accompanied by the formation of a bow shock ahead of the bubble that compresses and heats the nuclear fuel .",
    "our attempts to associate this region with a possible transition to detonation failed .",
    "we discovered , however , that the flood of the expelled surface layers that follows the bubble breakout remains confined to low radii above the star .",
    "this flood races around the star and is ultimately focused into a hot , compressed , high density region located just above the stellar surface .",
    "conditions in this region satisfy the criteria necessary for a detonation .",
    "one important aspect of the gcd mechanism is that stellar expansion is a natural consequence of the essentially central ignition of a deflagration .",
    "the flame releases energy and displaces mass , softening the gravitational potential well leading to expansion of the star .",
    "the expansion will slow down on a time scale comparable to the sound crossing time of the white dwarf as the star tries to reach a new equilibrium .",
    "therefore , we expect that at still later times , if not for the fact that the detonation will completely disrupt the white dwarf , the initial expansion would be followed by contraction of stellar material and the star would oscillate .    because of this pre - expansion , the detonation front born above the stellar surface will encounter densities similar to those found in models where pre - expansion results from a centrally ignited large - scale deflagration  @xcite .",
    "the estimate of nucleosynthetic yield for intermediate mass ( iron peak ) elements is a lower ( upper ) limit in view of the fact that the stellar expansion continues after the moment of the detonation . determining the final yields",
    ", however , requires simulating the detonation .",
    "the actual conditions across the detonation wave , particularly the amount of compression , will influence the results .",
    "also , the yields can be modified by delaying or by accelerating the ignition of the detonation to create a family of type ia supernovae with diverse spectral characteristics .",
    "the exact timing of the detonation depends on several factors .",
    "the structure of the progenitor influences energy release by the deflagration .",
    "it also affects the strength and mass of the stellar layers being pushed around the star .",
    "the radius of the progenitor regulates the time required by the streaming matter to reach the confluence point .",
    "all these factors determine the time available for stellar pre - expansion and will be a source of diversity in gcd models .",
    "some properties of the proposed model are , however , largely independent of the precise details of the ignition of the detonation or stellar progenitor",
    ". the explosion will be powerful .",
    "all the stellar fuel will be consumed by the detonation . despite the perturbation introduced by the deflagration",
    ", the star will retain most of its radially symmetric stratification .",
    "therefore , the subsequent explosion will display characteristics well - known from one - dimensional investigations @xcite .",
    "in particular , we expect the distribution of nucleosynthetic products in velocity space to agree with the observed layered structure of type ia supernova ejecta .",
    "the model also naturally admits certain asymmetries .",
    "the deflagration consumes only about 5% of the stellar mass .",
    "we expect a similar level of variation in the resulting spectra and luminosities , in agreement with degree of diversity present in the observations @xcite .",
    "in addition , because the stellar shape is distorted by the rising bubble and the formation of the detonation on one side of the star , we expect a noticeable asymmetry in the stellar ejecta",
    ". these orientation effects might be responsible for peculiar events such as sn 1991 t @xcite .",
    "because the gross properties of observed type ia supernovae can be accounted for in the gcd model , detailed observations will be required to verify the proposed mechanism .",
    "one possibility is to obtain information about the degree of asymmetry in these explosions , using precision polarimetric measurements .    in this short communication",
    ", we have not presented simulations that support all of our predictions .",
    "rather , we have presented a logical sequence of events that naturally leads to a type ia supernova explosion .",
    "several of these steps need to be carefully studied .",
    "in particular , the proposed detonation mechanism bears many similarities to the process of confined fusion studied in terrestrial laboratory experiments , which is notoriously difficult and prone to instabilities . for this reason",
    ", the early stages of the detonation should be studied very carefully .",
    "the expected computational demands and challenges are severe and clearly approach limits of feasibility . despite the fact that such a study lies in the future",
    ", we are confident in the basic components of the proposed gcd mechanism .",
