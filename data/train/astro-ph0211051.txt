    "the ultra - high energy ( uhe ; @xmath0 ev ) cosmic ray research has been initiated about 40 years ago .",
    "several experiments have been carried out and at present agasa @xcite , hires @xcite and yakutsuk @xcite experiments are in operation to observe air showers initiated by uhe cosmic rays ( see for a review @xcite ) .",
    "today the number of recorded events is already big enough to convince even strong sceptics that the cosmic ray energy spectrum extends well beyond the theoretically expected greisen - zatzepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff around @xmath2 ev @xcite .",
    "the origin and nature of these particles are still unsolved questions .",
    "the problem is that it is very difficult to extend our understanding of particle acceleration to such extraordinary high energies and the propagation of these particles in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation restricts the distance to their potential sources within several tens of megaparsecs ( 1 mpc @xmath3 cm ) .",
    "various models of uhe cosmic ray origin have been proposed .",
    "they are currently a subject of very intensive discussion ( see for a review @xcite ) .",
    "models can be categorized into two basic groups of `` scenarios '' : `` bottom - up '' and `` top - down '' .",
    "conventional `` bottom - up '' scenarios look for astrophysical sources called `` zevatrons '' ( 1 z ev = @xmath4 ev ) that can accelerate particles to energies in excess of @xmath5 ev .",
    "the composition of uhe cosmic rays is expected to be hadronic .",
    "possible candidates include clusters of galaxies , active galactic nuclei ( agn ) radio lobes , agn central regions , young neutron stars , magnetars , gamma ray bursts , etc .    in the `` top - down '' scenarios uhe cosmic rays instead of being accelerated",
    "are generated from decay of some exotic very heavy ( @xmath6  @xmath7 ev ) _ x - particles _ that are supposed to have been formed in the early universe .",
    "the sources of x - particles may be topological defects ( cosmic strings , cosmic necklaces , magnetic monopoles , domain walls ) @xcite or long - lived super - heavy relic particles @xcite .    the cascade process initiated by a super - high energy neutrino ( @xmath8 ev ) in the relic neutrino background ( the so - called z - burst model )",
    "@xcite is another possible scenario which is a hybrid of astrophysical zevatrons with new particles @xcite .",
    "in general , `` top - down '' and `` hybrid '' scenarios predict a rather high flux of uhe neutrinos exceeding the observed cosmic ray flux .",
    "gamma rays account for a part or most of the highest energy cosmic rays above @xmath5 ev , whereas nucleons would dominate at lower energies .",
    "thus the primary composition , especially the gamma ray content ( reffered to as gamma / proton ratio ) , is a powerful discriminator between the models of the uhe cosmic ray origin .",
    "it should be mentioned that even within conventional  bottom - up ",
    "models one can expect a significant gamma / proton ratio due to the decay of neutral pions produced in cosmic ray interactions with the 2.7 k cmb photons . under certain circumstances ( extragalactic magnetic field strength , distance to the sources , maximal proton energy , slope of the proton energy spectrum , etc . ) , the subsequent electromagnetic cascade in the intergalactic space can lead to a uhe gamma ray flux comparable to the observed cosmic ray flux @xcite .",
    "air showers initiated by uhe gamma rays have characteristic features in comparison with `` ordinary '' hadronic showers .",
    "two effects must be taken into account for a study of air shower development in case of gamma ray primaries ",
    "the _ landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) _ effect and _ cascading in the geomagnetic field_.    the influence of the lpm effect @xcite on shower development has been studied by many authors during the last thirty years .",
    "the effect reduces the bethe - heitler ( bh ) cross sections for bremsstrahlung and pair production at energies @xmath9 ev in the atmosphere leading to a significant elongation of the electromagnetic shower and large fluctuations in the shower development .",
    "generally , this effect is well understood although there is no commonly accepted standard code taking into account the lpm effect in electromagnetic shower modeling .",
    "it should be pointed out that other possible mechanisms of suppression of bremsstrahlung and pair creation processes at extremely high energies have to be more carefully studied @xcite .",
    "once the electron - positron pair is produced in uhe gamma ray interaction with the geomagnetic field away from the earth s surface , it initiates an electromagnetic  cascade  due to synchrotron radiation before entering the atmosphere . as a result ,",
    "the energy of the primary gamma ray is shared by a bunch of lower energy secondary particles which are mainly photons and a few electron - positron pairs .",
    "the influence of the lpm effect on subsequent showers in the atmosphere is significantly weakened .",
    "the history of electromagnetic cascade calculations in the geomagnetic field is also long enough since it started with the work of mcbreen and lambert @xcite .",
    "the main results of previous works @xcite are in a good agreement .",
    "recent calculations refined the previous ones revealing some practically important features in the cascading process .",
    "for example , in @xcite it is shown that the study of two major components of the giant air showers , the size spectra and muon content , can reveal the nature of the uhe cosmic rays if the specific dependence on the shower arrival direction is observed . some observables that can be extracted from the pierre auger observatory detectors ( longitudinal profiles , lateral distribution and front curvature )",
    "are discussed in @xcite . in @xcite the technique of adjoint cascade equations was applied to study uhe gamma ray shower characteristics in the geomagnetic field and in the atmosphere emphasizing the muon component of air shower .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to study in details the uhe gamma ray shower characteristics that are measurable by air fluorescence detectors .",
    "it is also important to know the difference in longitudinal shower development between gamma ray and hadronic showers which can be used for an effective separation between these primary species . in the following",
    ", we will discuss the dependence of uhe gamma ray shower characteristics on the incident direction and the possibility of detecting such showers in the future experiments .",
    "about sixty years ago soon after auger s discovery of the extensive air showers , pomeranchuk @xcite estimated the maximal energy of primary cosmic ray electrons and gamma rays that is allowed to enter the atmosphere after interactions with geomagnetic field . according to his calculations ,",
    "the maximal electron energy @xmath10 due to radiation in the geomagnetic field is a few times @xmath11 ev ( @xmath12 ev for vertically incident electrons on the geomagnetic equatorial plane ) .",
    "whatever energy greater than @xmath10 electrons have , they lose their energies rapidly down to below @xmath10 .",
    "the analogous gamma ray energy due to pair creation in the geomagnetic field is @xmath13 ev .",
    "similar to cascading in matter , the main elementary processes leading to particle multiplication in magnetic field are magnetic bremsstrahlung ( synchrotron radiation ) and magnetic pair production . it is well known that essentially non - zero probabilities for magnetic bremsstrahlung and pair production require both strong field and high energies @xcite .",
    "the relevant parameter determining the criteria for this is : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the particle energy , @xmath16 is the magnetic field strength ( the component perpendicular to the particle trajectory ) , @xmath17 is the electron mass and @xmath18 g.    the total probabilities ( cross sections ) for radiation and pair production for a given value of the magnetic field strength depend only on @xmath19 and are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "magnetic pair production has significant probability for @xmath20 0.1 . for effective shower development",
    ", however , one needs even higher values of @xmath21 because the radiated photon spectrum becomes harder with increasing @xmath19 .",
    "the maximal photon energy estimated by pomeranchuk ( @xmath13 ev ) comes from the condition @xmath22 .",
    "we use the expressions of bayer et al .",
    "@xcite for the differential probabilities ( per unit length ) for magnetic bremsstrahlung and magnetic pair production :    @xmath23    \\label{eq1}\\ ] ]    for bremsstralung , and @xmath24\\ ] ] @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the electron and photon energies and @xmath28 , @xmath29 . here",
    "@xmath31 @xmath32 is the modified bessel function known as macdonald s function .",
    "while for @xmath33 ( strong field ) the electromagnetic cascade develops similar to the cascade in matter @xcite , in case of @xmath34 1 the photon interaction length increases sharply with decreasing photon energy .",
    "electrons continue to radiate and the shower becomes a bunch of secondary photons carrying more than @xmath35 of the primary energy .",
    "in our simulation studies of air showers initiated by gamma rays and hadrons ( proton or iron ) , we use the aires code ( version 2.2.1 ) @xcite incorporated with qgsjet hadronic interaction model @xcite .",
    "aires includes the lpm effect in simulation of electromagnetic showers . for simulations of electromagnetic cascades in the geomagnetic field",
    "we use our original code .    to simulate showers initiated by uhe gamma rays , we first model cascading in the geomagnetic field starting with a single uhe gamma ray far away from the earth s surface down to the top of the atmosphere . then secondary particles that reach the top of atmosphere are set as an input for the aires code .",
    "finally , the air shower initiated by the uhe gamma ray is constructed as a superposition of lower energy gamma ray sub - showers . in practice ,",
    "we use a library of pre - simulated showers in the atmosphere which has been calculated by the aires code .",
    "we simulate the electromagnetic cascade in the geomagnetic field by injecting a uhe gamma ray at a distance of @xmath36 away from the earth s surface where @xmath37 is the earth s radius of @xmath38 cm .",
    "the primary gamma ray and secondary particles are propagated by taking account of pair production and synchrotron radiation on each step ( a step - size of 1 km ) .",
    "only particles above a threshold energy of @xmath39 ev are followed in the simulation until they reach the top of the atmosphere .",
    "this threshold energy is low enough to neglect the contribution of sub - threshold particles in the cascade .    in order to examine the properties of electromagnetic cascades as a function of the incident direction , we divide uniformly the sky by bins of @xmath40 for both azimuth and zenith angles to 1085 points and",
    "simulate 50 events for each point . in our simulation",
    "we use the international geomagnetic reference field ( igrf ) and world magnetic model ( wmm ) which provide a good approximation for the geomagnetic field up to 600 km above sea level @xcite . above this altitude the geomagnetic field is extrapolated from this model .    in the present work",
    "we examine the properties of uhe gamma ray showers for the location of utah , usa ( long .",
    "= @xmath41 w , lat .",
    "= @xmath42n and 1500 m above sea level ) near the site of the hires experiment . in this location",
    ", igrf gives the field of 0.53 g pointing @xmath43 downword from @xmath44 east of the geographical ( true ) north .",
    "the simulations of atmospheric showers are carried out independently from the geomagnetic cascading process . using aires code",
    ", we first prepare a library of sub - showers initiated by gamma rays with zenith angles of @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 and energy fixed between @xmath48 and @xmath4 ev at logarithmically equally spaced values ( 10 energies per decade ) .",
    "the number of all charged particles are recorded at 5 g @xmath49 intervals in vertical depth .",
    "the library contains 500 showers at each energy .",
    "it should be noted that this number is significantly greater than the maximal number ( @xmath50 ) of secondary gamma rays from the geomagnetic cascade in each energy bin .",
    "the construction of uhe gamma ray initiated shower is carried out by a method similar to the so - called  boot - strap  method as following : @xmath51-th secondary particle with energy @xmath52 at the top of atmosphere is followed by a sub - shower with the nearest energy @xmath53 selected randomly from the library . the secondary electron is replaced by a gamma ray with the same energy . by summing up the sub - showers @xmath54 with a weight @xmath55 , the atmospheric shower initiated by a single gamma ray with energy @xmath56 is represented as a superposition of sub - showers with total energy @xmath57 .    in the present work we also aimulate",
    "amples of 500 hadron ( proton and iron ) initiated showers for the same zenith angles and energy range to compare the results .",
    "the cascade development is determined by the features of the cross sections of the processes and the field strength .",
    "the maximal values of the parameter @xmath19 which governs cascading do not much exceed 1 , e.g. @xmath58 for @xmath5 ev and @xmath59 g , and @xmath60 for @xmath61 ev and same @xmath16 , i.e. one can expect only a few gamma ray interactions ( pair creations ) in the shower .",
    "but such @xmath16 values are characteristic for the surface of the earth .",
    "the field strength rapidly decreases with the geocentric distance , @xmath62 , which means that the cascade starts not far from the surface of the earth .",
    "the first interaction of the gamma rays with the energies of interest occurs in relatively narrow range of distances not further than @xmath63 .",
    "for example , the mean altitude of the first interaction of vertical gamma rays with primary energy @xmath64 ev is about 5300 km .",
    "the typical shower profiles averaged over 1000 showers for @xmath65 ev and different threshold energies for secondary photons and electrons are shown in fig . 2 ( bottom panel ) .",
    "the zenith angle is @xmath66 and the azimuth corresponds to north ( strong field ) .",
    "for comparison in this figure is also shown the shower profile for the secondary photons with energy above @xmath39 ev in a shower coming from south ( weak field ) .",
    "this picture differs too much from the cascade development in the matter . as the primary energy distributes between the electron and photon components ( see the top panel of fig .",
    "2 ) , the mean photon energy decreases and when @xmath67 the mean free path for pair production sharply increases ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . the energy of the electron component starts to return quickly to the photon component and the shower converts to a beam of photons carrying the bulk of the primary energy . for the case shown in fig .",
    "2 ( strong field ) the mean number of gamma ray interactions per shower in the geomagnetic field is approximately @xmath68 ( 1.11 for the sample of 1000 showers ) which means that there is almost no pair creation after the initial interaction . for @xmath69 ev and same conditions",
    "this number increases to 4.16 .",
    "this is the reason for the much smaller number of electrons than photons in the shower . in our example , for the strong field , the mean number of electrons reaching the top of the atmosphere , is 2.22 ( = @xmath70 ) for @xmath39 ev threshold energy .",
    "these electrons carry @xmath71 of the primary energy . in the case of weak field ( line with symbols in fig .",
    "2 ) , the probability of the primary gamma ray to interact in the geomagnetic field is only @xmath72 and this happens on an average of @xmath73 km from the sea level .    in utah ,",
    "the southern sky region is close to the direction of the geomagnetic field and hence the effect of geomagnetic cascading is relatively small .",
    "gamma rays arriving from the northern sky region travel through stronger field whose strength increases with the zenith angle . generally , primary gamma rays are most affected by the geomagnetic field when they come from the northern sky or near the horizon .",
    "3 shows maps for the gamma ray conversion ( interaction ) probability ( grey scale ) with the geomagnetic field for all incident directions in horizontal coordinates .",
    "the different panels correspond to primary energies @xmath74 , @xmath5 , @xmath75 and @xmath4 ev .",
    "the radial coordinate is the zenith angle @xmath76 .",
    "the inner circles correspond to @xmath77 and @xmath78 , and the outer one is of the horizon .",
    "azimuths are as labeled ` n ' denotes the true north ) . dashed curves indicate the opening angles of @xmath79 , @xmath78 and @xmath80 to the local magnetic field .",
    "the region with smaller probability is around the direction which is parallel to the local geomagnetic field . from this region ,",
    "primary gamma rays are most likely to enter the atmosphere without interaction .",
    "thus , this region can be referred to as `` window '' for the primary gamma rays . through this window they can reach the top of the atmosphere surviving interaction and be observed as ` lpm showers ' .",
    "the size of this window shrinks rapidly with increasing primary energy and almost all gamma rays with @xmath56 @xmath81 ev initiate a geomagnetic cascade above the atmosphere .",
    "4 shows maps of the average multiplicity of the secondary particles ( number of electrons plus photons above @xmath39 ev ; grey scale ) at the top of atmosphere on the same coordinates as in fig .",
    "the average energy of secondary particles ( @xmath56/multiplicity ) is plotted in fig .",
    "the patterns of these maps match well the field strength , i.e. the direction of the geomagnetic field at the ground level , which reflects the fact that the first interaction occurs not far from the earth s surface .    for low primary energy and/or weak field strength , i.e. small @xmath82 , the primary gamma ray does not or only once produces electron - pair before reaching the top of the atmosphere .",
    "the produced electrons continuously radiate photons by magnetic bremsstrahlung and the multiplicity increases with the primary energy .",
    "nevertheless , radiated photons can hardly interact again with the geomagnetic field unless @xmath19 @xmath83 .    for the direction with very strong field ( or very high primary energy ) , i.e. large @xmath84 , e.g. for the northern sky region or near - horizontally incident gamma rays , the multiplicity is almost proportional to the primary energy which leads to a nearly constant average particle energy at the top of the atmosphere ( see fig .",
    "this energy is about a few times of @xmath11 ev . in the sky regions where the conversion probability is 100% the maximal average energy of the secondary particles , which are mainly photons , do not exceed several times @xmath1 ev",
    "this is consistent with the estimation by pomeranchuk @xcite described previously and thus the lpm effect is ineffective in the atmosphere except for the window regions .",
    "the multiplicity distribution of secondary particles at the top of the atmosphere for different incident zenith angles ( @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 and azimuths corresponding to north and south , are plotted in fig .",
    "each histogram includes 1000 simulated showers .",
    "the columns in the first bin of each panel correspond to the primary gamma rays that do not interact in the geomagnetic field . in regions with 100% conversion probability",
    "the fluctuations are small for large @xmath84 due to the better cascade development by the more gamma ray interactions above the astmosphere .",
    "7 shows the average energy distribution ( spectrum ) of secondary particles at the top of the atmosphere .",
    "the data belong to the same set of simulated showers as in fig .",
    "the ` surviving ' primary gamma rays manifest themselves by the columns in the last bins of some histograms .",
    "the maximum of the spectrum shifts towards the higher energies when @xmath56 increases .",
    "however , except for the cases where the probability of survival primaries is large , i.e. the conversion probability is not close to 100% , this shift slows down for @xmath56 @xmath88 ev and the shape of the spectrum remains almost same for the highest energies . as mentioned previously , the multiplicity of secondaries is almost proportional to @xmath56 . the spectra display sharp cutoff at a few times @xmath1 ev and subsequent sub - showers in the atmosphere",
    "are not affected by the lpm effect .",
    "we discuss this in the next subsection .",
    "we estimate the lateral spread of particles at the top of the atmosphere .",
    "all particles are contained within a radius of about 10 cm .",
    "this value is much greater than 0.1 mm given in @xcite but is still too small to be taken into account .",
    "thus , successive shower developments in the atmosphere can be correctly expressed as a superposition of atmospheric sub - showers initiated by secondary particles with such energy spectra .",
    "8 shows examples of individual shower developments initiated by primary gamma rays with @xmath89 and @xmath4 ev .",
    "left and right panels correspond to azimuths from north and south , respectively .",
    "zenith angles are @xmath85 , @xmath46 and @xmath90 . dashed curves represent the average shower profiles for proton primaries .",
    "this figure illusrates very well a remarkable feature of the shower development at these energies  significantly small fluctuations in the case that the primary gamma ray interacts with the geomagnetic field .",
    "the largest fluctuations in the shower development can be found for @xmath91 ev , @xmath92 and incident direction from south . in this case",
    "the primary gamma ray conversion probability in the geomagnetic field is only several percent and the lpm effect affects strongly the shower development in the atmosphere .",
    "increasing primary energy leads to significant decrease of fluctuations and this trend is stronger for the sky regions close to the horizon ( large @xmath16 ) .",
    "these two effects are more pronounced for northern sky regions .    fig .",
    "9 shows distributions of the average depth of the shower maximum in the atmosphere @xmath93 for showers with @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath5 , @xmath75 and @xmath4 ev .",
    "we present the cases of zenith angles of @xmath46 and @xmath47 in left and right panels , respectively . in each panel ,",
    "the solid line indicates the distribution of proton showers .",
    "dotted and dashed lines represent those for gamma ray showers from azimuths of north and south , respectively .",
    "the shape of @xmath93 distributions of gamma ray showers noticeably varies with primary energy and incident direction . as the primary energy increases",
    ", the distributions become narrower and the mean values are almost constant for energies @xmath88 ev ( see also fig .",
    "some distributions having two maxima or long tail to the deeper @xmath96 result from a mixture of converted and not - converted gamma rays above the atmosphere .    in fig .",
    "10 , maps of @xmath96 are shown on the same coordinates as in figs .",
    "the data for this figure are obtained by the following approximation .",
    "the simulation of the shower development is based on the method described in the previous section . for a given zenith angle we use data from the library of pre - simulated showers with similar zenith angle .",
    "since the magnitude of the lpm effect depends on the atmospheric density profile along the particle trajectory , there is a small dependence on the incident zenith angle . in the vertical region for @xmath5 ev , this effect possibly matters and @xmath93 can be higher than shown due to the lack of air shower library for this direction . for higher primary energy or other sky region , however , primary gamma rays are converted and thus it is not necessary to take into account the lpm effect for the estimation of @xmath93 .    in each map ,",
    "i.e. for each @xmath56 , @xmath97 reflects the dependence of geomagnetic cascading on the incident direction .",
    "typically , gamma ray showers with larger @xmath97 are predominantly coming from southern sky region . only for @xmath98",
    "ev there is a small window where gamma ray showers are affected by the lpm effect .",
    "this region may serve as a probe for uhe gamma ray presence .",
    "11 shows the relation between @xmath93 and @xmath99 for gamma ray showers . for comparison ,",
    "corresponding relations for proton and iron primaries are also drawn in the figure .",
    "incident azimuths of gamma rays are from north and south . dashed lines and thick solid lines are for zenith angles of @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "the dotted curve indicates the case of no geomagnetic field .",
    "for proton and iron showers @xmath93 increases with @xmath56 and the slope of the relation , i.e. the elongation rates are almost constant and are 54 and 56 g @xmath49/decade , respectively . the elongation rate for gamma ray showers is greater than those of hadronic ones and is also constant according to the electromagnetic cascade theory up to energies @xmath100 ev . above this energy",
    "the lpm effect steepens the relation of @xmath93 versus @xmath99 as shown by the dotted line in the figure .",
    "the geomagnetic cascading starts to `` work '' approximately at the same energy , about several times @xmath1 ev . at this energy which depends on the incident direction",
    ", @xmath93 reaches its maximum . above this energy",
    "the geomagnetic cascade develops well enough to suppress the lpm effect in the atmosphere .",
    "this leads to a rapid decrease of @xmath101 .",
    "the slow increase of @xmath93 after its minimum results from the slow increase of the fraction of secondary photons above the threshold for the lpm effect ( see fig .",
    "the multiplicity also increases proportionally to @xmath56 which leads to almost constant average photon energy in the bunch above @xmath5 ev .",
    "it must be noted that a superposition of bh sub - showers has smaller @xmath101 than a single bh shower with an energy equal to the sum of the sub - shower energies .    in fig .",
    "12 , the fluctuations of @xmath96 ( the standard deviation of @xmath102 distribution ) are shown as a function of primary energy .",
    "the line key is the same as in fig .",
    "11 but the case of no geomagnetic field is not shown .",
    "similar to @xmath93 , the fluctuations for gamma ray showers vary typically depending on primary energy and incident direction , while those for proton and iron showers are almost constant , @xmath103 g @xmath49 and @xmath104 g @xmath49 , respectively .    for gamma ray showers ,",
    "the picture between @xmath105 and @xmath5 ev is similar to that in fig .",
    "large fluctuations are due to the lpm effect . for energies at which the geomagnetic cascading is effective , the fluctuations decrease rapidly with the energy . at the highest energies , the fluctuations tend to be as small as those for iron showers .",
    "this behavior attributes to a competition between the lpm effect and geomagnetic cascading as in fig .",
    "our study shows that the longitudinal development of gamma ray showers is not simply scaled with primary energy .",
    "shower development in the energy region above @xmath106 ev shows very specific dependence both on the primary energy and incident direction .",
    "@xmath93 of gamma ray showers is larger than that expected for proton showers .",
    "furthermore , the elongation rate of gamma ray showers shows considerable variation with energy depending on their incident directions .",
    "the future observation of these longitudinal shower characteristics with better statistical accuracy would be the possible key for studying the uhe gamma ray flux .",
    "also , additional information may be obtained from the properties of @xmath96 fluctuations .    in order to acquire a definite conclusions of the primary composition of uhe cosmic rays",
    ", more elaborate considerations may be required due to a limited statistics and difficulty in separating between gamma ray and hadronic showers .",
    "for example as is shown above , the fluctuations of @xmath96 for gamma ray showers become even less than those for proton showers and are close to iron showers above @xmath5 ev .",
    "we expect that the development of a number of uhe showers would be measured with a better accuracy in the near future which will be the first decisive step in looking for uhe gamma rays .    if the observed showers develop slowly from the sky region nearby the window ( see figs .",
    "2  4 and 9 ) showing typical characteristics of lpm showers , this could be a noticeable and physically important evidence of the uhe gamma ray presence .",
    "as was earlier mentioned in @xcite , magnetic bremsstrahlung process may be important for the shower development at high altitudes where the atmospheric density is very low . according to the estimations in @xcite , made by numerical integration of the system of cascade equations ,",
    "the interaction of shower particles with the geomagnetic field inside the atmosphere becomes important for cascades created by primary gamma rays with energies higher than @xmath107 ev .",
    "for example , injecting the gamma rays with energy @xmath5 ev vertically into the atmosphere , the number of particles in showers at sea level calculated only with lpm effect is @xmath108 less than that in showers when interactions with the geomagnetic effect ( for @xmath109 g ) taken into account .",
    "this difference increases with the primary energy up to @xmath110 2.5 times for @xmath4 ev . using our own simple hybrid code for one - dimensional atmospheric shower simulation",
    "we obtain similar results showing also a noticeable shift of the shower maximum .",
    "this work is now in progress .",
    "planned projects ( auger @xcite , euso @xcite , etc . ) to study uhe cosmic rays promise to observe individual shower development with better accuracy .",
    "it is important to find the effective and reasonable physical parameters from simulation studies in order to discriminate gamma ray showers from hadronic ones on event by event basis",
    ". it can be also strong probe by including the fluctuation study in addition to average shower development in the discussions about the composition of uhe cosmic rays .",
