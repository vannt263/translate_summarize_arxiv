    "two - neutron transfer reactions such as ( @xmath7,@xmath8 ) or ( @xmath8,@xmath7 ) have been used for many years in order to study the nucleon pairing correlations in the stable nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding pair transfer modes are usually described in terms of pairing vibrations or pairing rotations  @xcite , which are associated with the pair correlation .",
    "it has been established that the two - neutron transfer amplitude is influenced by collective modes caused by the cooper - pair superfluidity  @xcite . in the superfluid nuclei @xmath0o , @xmath9pb , and @xmath10sn ,",
    "the cooper pair with short range space correlation has been theoretically predicted  @xcite .",
    "the size of the cooper pair is estimated to be comparable to the average inter - nucleon distance  @xcite .",
    "recently , there is a renewal of interest on experimental nucleon pair , alpha cluster , and more generally multinucleon transfer channels at bombarding energies above and below the coulomb barriers  @xcite .",
    "the effect of correlations between nucleons on the nuclear breakup or decay mechanism has been studied both experimentally and theoretically  @xcite .",
    "studies of pairing effects in both finite nuclei and nuclear matter have intensified interests in the recent years  @xcite .",
    "attention has been paid to the properties of the pair correlation in the neutron - rich nuclei with the neutron skin and the neutron halo  @xcite .",
    "the ( @xmath7,@xmath8 ) reactions on light - mass neutron - rich nuclei such as @xmath11he and @xmath12li point out the importance of the pair correlations in these typical halo or skin nuclei .",
    "the experimental signatures of a spatial two - neutron correlation or the di - neutron correlation between two weakly bound neutrons forming the halo in @xmath11he and @xmath12li have been reported in refs .",
    "there exists also several studies demonstrating enhancement of the pair correlation in the nuclear surface and exterior regions of the neutron - rich nuclei  @xcite .",
    "a possible link between the pair transfer and the surface enhancement of the pairing in medium and heavy neutron - rich nuclei has been suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite and more recently discussed in @xcite it has been argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that the pair transfer can be a possible probe of different models of the pairing interaction . in literature",
    "@xcite , the origin of the small size of cooper pair on the nuclear surface is still under discussions .",
    "it can be a consequence of the enhanced pairing correlations or of the finiteness of the single - particle wave functions .",
    "a strong spatial correlation between the nucleons gives rise to specific features like dineutron or alpha clustering formation and to the possibility of a contribution to the transfer from the simultaneous one - step pair transfer mechanism . by describing the capture ( fusion ) reactions at sub - barrier energies within the quantum diffusion approach , we want to demonstrate indirectly the strong dineutron spatial correlations in the surface region of stable nuclei .",
    "we will consider the capture reactions with the negative one - neutron transfer ( @xmath13 ) and the positive two - neutron transfer ( @xmath14 ) ( before crossing the coulomb barrier ) , where the one - step neutron pair transfer is expected to be dominant .",
    "the study of this process is one of the important points in the understanding of pairing correlations in nuclei .",
    "the distinction between two - step sequential and one - step cluster transfer is a great challenge , not only in nuclear physics but also in electron transfer between ions or atomic cluster collisions  @xcite .",
    "note that the capture ( fusion ) reaction following the neutron pair transfer is the indirect way of the study of pairing effects .",
    "in the quantum diffusion approach  @xcite the collisions of nuclei are treated in terms of a single collective variable : the relative distance between the colliding nuclei .",
    "the nuclear deformation effects are taken into consideration through the dependence of the nucleus - nucleus potential on the deformations and mutual orientations of the colliding nuclei .",
    "our approach takes into account the fluctuation and dissipation effects in the collisions of heavy ions which model the coupling with various channels ( for example , coupling of the relative motion with the non - collective single - particle excitations and low - lying collective modes such as dynamical quadrupole and octupole excitations of the target and projectile  @xcite ) .",
    "we have to mention that many quantum - mechanical and non - markovian effects accompanying the passage through the potential barrier are considered in our formalism  @xcite through the friction and diffusion .",
    "the two - neutron transfer with the positive @xmath15-value was taken into consideration in  @xcite .",
    "our assumption is that , just before the projectile is captured by the target - nucleus ( i.e. just before the crossing of the coulomb barrier ) , the two - neutron transfer occurs and can lead to the population of the first excited collective state in the recipient nucleus  @xcite ( the donor nucleus remains in the ground state ) .",
    "so , the motion to the @xmath16 equilibrium starts in the system before the capture because it is energetically favorable in the dinuclear system in the vicinity of the coulomb barrier .",
    "for the reactions under consideration , the average change of mass asymmetry is connected to the two - neutron transfer ( @xmath17-transfer ) . since after the transfer the mass numbers , the isotopic composition and the deformation parameters of the interacting nuclei , and , correspondingly , the height @xmath18 [ @xmath19 is the position of the coulomb barrier ] and shape of the coulomb barrier change , one can expect an enhancement or suppression of the capture . if after the neutron transfer the deformations of interacting nuclei increase ( decrease ) , the capture probability increases ( decreases ) .",
    "when the isotopic dependence of the nucleus - nucleus potential is weak and after the transfer the deformations of interacting nuclei do not change , there is no effect of the neutron transfer on the capture . in comparison with ref .",
    "@xcite , we assume that the negative transfer @xmath20values do not play visible role in the capture process .",
    "our scenario was verified in the description of many reactions @xcite .",
    "the calculated results for all reactions are obtained with the same set of parameters as in refs .",
    "@xcite and are rather insensitive to the reasonable variation of them .",
    "one should note that the diffusion models , which include quantum statistical effects , were also treated in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the capture cross section is the sum of the partial capture cross sections @xcite    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the reduced de broglie wavelength , @xmath23 is the reduced mass ( @xmath24 is the nucleon mass ) , and the summation is over the possible values of the angular momentum @xmath25 at a given bombarding energy @xmath26 .",
    "knowing the potential of the interacting nuclei for each orientation with the angles @xmath27 , one can obtain the partial capture probability @xmath28 which is defined by the probability to penetrate the potential barrier in the relative distance coordinate @xmath29 at a given @xmath25 .",
    "the value of @xmath28 is obtained by integrating the propagator @xmath30 from the initial state @xmath31 at time @xmath32 to the final state @xmath33 at time @xmath8 ( @xmath34 is the momentum ) : @xmath35 . \\label{1ab_eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath36 is an internal turning point . the second line in ( [ 1ab_eq ] )",

    "the classical action is calculated for the realistic nucleus - nucleus potential . then the realistic nucleus - nucleus potential is replaced by an inverted oscillator which has the same barrier height and classical action .",
    "so , the frequency @xmath47 of this oscillator is set to obtain an equality of the classical actions in the approximated and realistic potentials .",
    "the action is calculated in the wkb approximation which is the accurate at the sub - barrier energies . usually in the literature",

    "( [ pc_eq ] ) . for @xmath62 ,",
    "it is natural to start our treatment with @xmath63 and @xmath64 defined by the kinetic energy at @xmath65 . in this case",
    "the friction hinders the classical motion to proceed towards smaller values of @xmath29 . if @xmath61 at @xmath66 , the friction almost does not play a role in the transition through the barrier .",
    "thus , two regimes of interaction at sub - barrier energies differ by the action of the nuclear forces and the role of friction at @xmath67 .",
    "to calculate the nucleus - nucleus interaction potential @xmath68 , we use the procedure described in refs .  @xcite .",

    "@xcite from a comparison of the calculated capture cross sections with the existing experimental data .",
    "the choice of the projectile - target combination is crucial in the understanding of pair transfer phenomenon in the capture process . in the capture reactions with @xmath13 and @xmath14 ,",
    "the two - step sequential transfer is almost closed before capture .",
    "so , choosing properly the reaction combination , one can reduce the successive transfer in the process .",
    "for the systems studied , one can make unambiguous statements regarding the neutron transfer process with a positive @xmath15 value when the interacting nuclei are double magic or semimagic nuclei . in this case",

    "figure 6 gives an interesting insight in the one- and two - neutron transfers .",
    "as seen , a strong enhancement of @xmath144 and @xmath145 occurs with increasing bombarding energy .",

    "we also note that the energy windows where the two - nucleon channel becomes dominant increases as the neutron nucleus become more exotic .",
    "this evidently supports our assumption about important role of the two - neutron transfer ( compared to the one - neutron transfer ) in the capture process , because in the tdhf calculation the scattering trajectory of two heavy ions at energy near the coulomb barrier is close to the capture trajectory .",
    "note that in the capture process the system trajectory crosses the barrier position @xmath19 at any energies .",
    "the results of our calculations predict that there is the crossing point of @xmath145 and @xmath144 at energy very close to the coulomb barrier . just before reaching @xmath154",

    "thus , our assumption about two - neutron transfer before the capture is correct .",
