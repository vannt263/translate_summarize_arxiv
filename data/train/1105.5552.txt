    "nonwoven materials or fleece are webs of long flexible fibers that are used for composite materials , e.g.  filters , as well as in the hygiene and textile industries .",
    "they are produced in melt  spinning operations : hundreds of individual endless fibers are obtained by the continuous extrusion of a molten polymer through narrow nozzles that are densely and equidistantly placed in a row at a spinning beam .",
    "the viscous or viscoelastic fibers are stretched and spun until they solidify due to cooling air streams . before the elastic fibers lay down on a moving conveyor belt to form a web , they become entangled and form loops due to the highly turbulent air flows .",
    "the homogeneity and load capacity of the fiber web are the most important textile properties for quality assessment of industrial nonwoven fabrics .",
    "the optimization and control of the fleece quality require modeling and simulation of fiber dynamics and lay  down .",
    "available data to judge the quality , at least on the industrial scale , are usually the mass per unit area of the fleece .    a stochastic model for the fiber deposition in the nonwoven production was proposed and analyzed in ref .",
    "its core is a stochastic ornstein  uhlenbeck process for the random motion of the fiber .",
    "the aim of this paper is to determine the parameters of the ornstein  uhlenbeck process from available mass per unit area data , i.e.  the occupation time in mathematical terms . for the sake of simplicity , we focus on a one  dimensional version of the ornstein  uhlenbeck process .    the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ s : model ]",
    "we introduce the ornstein  uhlenbeck process as a prototypic model for the fiber deposition . section  [ s : theory ] is devoted to the derivation of the expectation value for the occupation times .",
    "an algorithm to estimate the parameters in the ornstein  uhlenbeck process from available occupation times is presented along with numerical experiments in section  [ s : numerics ] .",
    "finally , we draw some conclusions and give an outlook to open questions .",
    "as a prototypic model for the fiber deposition , we consider the general one  dimensional ornstein  uhlenbeck process @xmath0 the equilibrium @xmath1 and the stiffness @xmath2 govern the deterministic part whereas the diffusion parameter @xmath3 and a standard wiener process ( or brownian motion ) @xmath4 contribute the stochastic part . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we consider mainly the centered process @xmath5 satisfying @xmath6    the real - valued random variable @xmath5 models the deposition point of an individual fiber on the fleece . if we follow the random variable over a time interval @xmath7 $ ] for @xmath8 , we obtain the path of an individual fiber . to introduce the mathematical analog of the mass per unit area",

    "it models the time , the random process spends inside the spatial interval @xmath9 $ ] during the time interval @xmath7 $ ] . in terms of our physical model for the nonwoven production",
    ", the occupation time can be interpreted as the mass of fiber material deposited inside the interval @xmath9 $ ] , i.e.  the mass per unit area of the final fleece .",
    "this quantity is easily accessible even on the scale of industrial production and hence it will serve as the input to our parameter estimation problem .    in the next chapter , we will present tools from white noise analysis to derive the expectation of the occupation time for the centered ornstein  uhlenbeck process @xmath5 .",
    "although it is possible to derive the results by classical stochastic analysis methods , we use a white noise approach to generalize the concepts also to higher dimensions , where one can give a rigorous meaning to multidimensional donskers delta functions as a white noise distribution , in later research .",
    "moreover in future work an extension to more complicated processes ( e.g. with fractional noise term ) is planed .",
    "thereafter we show , how to estimate the parameters @xmath16 , @xmath17 of the process from available data for the occupation times .",
    "we start by considering the gelfand triple @xmath18 , where @xmath19 denotes the schwartz space of rapidly decreasing smooth functions , @xmath20 the hilbert space of real  valued square integrable ( equivalence classes of ) functions on @xmath21 w.r.t .  lebesgue measure and @xmath22 the topological dual of @xmath19 , i.e.  the space of tempered distributions .",
