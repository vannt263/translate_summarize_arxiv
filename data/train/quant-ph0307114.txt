    "entanglement is a strange feature of quantum theory and gives rise to a non - local correlation called the einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) correlation  @xcite .",
    "the epr correlation was originally discussed to address the foundation of quantum theory .",
    "however , it is now widely recognized as a vital resource in quantum communication such as quantum teleportation  @xcite and quantum cryptography  @xcite .",
    "thus , to perform precise quantum communication , we must understand the properties of the epr correlation in various physical situations .",
    "recently , a number of articles  @xcite have discussed how entanglement is affected by the lorentz transformation in the regime of special relativity  @xcite .",
    "for example , the present authors previously discussed the epr correlation with moving observers who share a common rest frame  @xcite . in that study , we showed that the perfect anti - correlation of an epr pair of spins in the _ same _ direction deteriorates in the observers rest frame , and that the degree of the violation of bell s inequality  @xcite decreases apparently as the velocity of the observers increases . to utilize the perfect epr correlation and the maximal violation of bell s inequality",
    ", the moving observers must measure the spins in appropriately chosen _",
    "different _ directions ; the choice of such directions depends on the velocity of the observers and on that of the particles .    in this paper",
    ", we extend these considerations to a regime of general relativity by introducing a gravitational field . in general relativity , a gravitational field",
    "is represented by a curved spacetime , which entails a breakdown of the global rotational symmetry .",
    "a spin is , on the other hand , known to represent the rotational symmetry of a system .",
    "thus , the spin in general relativity can be defined only locally by invoking the local rotational symmetry of the local inertial frame . in the present paper , we show explicitly how to extract the _ non - local _ correlation from the _ locally _ defined spins .",
    "we also investigate how to extract the non - local correlation beyond the event horizon , which arises in strong gravitational fields and uniquely features the problem of general relativity .    as a consequence of the local definition ,",
    "a particle moving in curved spacetime is accompanied by a precession of its spin due to the acceleration of the particle by an external force and the difference between local inertial frames at different points .",
    "these effects of the particle s motion result in a continuous succession of local lorentz transformations .",
    "since a lorentz transformation rotates the spin of the particle according to the wigner rotation  @xcite , the motion of the particle leads to a continuous succession of local wigner rotations of the spin , producing spin precession .",
    "spin precession caused by acceleration may be viewed as a generalized thomas precession in curved spacetime .",
    "on the other hand , spin precession caused by a change in the local inertial frame is an effect of spacetime curvature .    applying both forms of spin precession to a relativistic epr state near the schwarzschild black hole ,",
    "we show that acceleration and gravity deteriorate the perfect anti - correlation in directions that would be the same as each other if the spacetime were flat , and that they apparently decrease the degree of the violation of bell s inequality , as in the case of moving observers in special relativity  @xcite . to exploit the perfect epr correlation and the maximal violation of bell s inequality",
    ", the observers must measure the spins in appropriately chosen different directions .",
    "identification of the appropriate directions depends on the velocity of the particles , the curvature of the spacetime , and the positions of the observers .",
    "surprisingly , while the parallel transport in general relativity can define which directions are the same as each other in curved spacetime  @xcite , the appropriate directions are _ not _ the same as each other even in this sense .",
    "we also show that , near the event horizon of the black hole , the appropriate directions depend quite sensitively on the positions of the observers , because the spin precession induced by the particle s motion becomes very rapid there .",
    "therefore , even a very small uncertainty in the identification of the observers positions leads to a fatal error in quantum communication near the event horizon .",
    "in particular , static observers can not extract the epr correlation from circularly moving particles unless they can find their own positions with infinite accuracy . to exploit the epr correlation on ( and beyond ) the event horizon",
    ", the observers must fall into the black hole together with the particles .",
    "an interesting distinction between the present general - relativistic problem and the special - relativistic one  @xcite is that in the former the lorentz transformation arises from the motion of the particle , not from that of the observer , because neither the general coordinate system nor the local inertial frame is changed at each point .",
    "this means that we could extend previous work on special - relativistic quantum information to the regime of general relativity only by considering moving particles in a gravitational field .",
    "recently , quantum communications with accelerated observers have been discussed  @xcite using the davies - unruh effect  @xcite in minkowski spacetime .",
    "however , their protocols have no special - relativistic analogy , since they do not involve the lorentz transformation . actually , their resources are not the entanglement between spins .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : spin ] formulates a spin-@xmath4 particle in a curved spacetime and shows a spin precession induced by the motion of the particle . as an example , the schwarzschild spacetime is considered .",
    "section  [ sec : eprbell ] discusses the epr correlation and bell s inequality in the schwarzschild spacetime , and explains how to extract the epr correlation on and beyond the event horizon subject to an uncertainty in the identification of observers positions .",
    "section  [ sec : summary ] summarizes our results .",
    "in general relativity , a gravitational field is represented by a curved spacetime with metric @xmath5 . to define a spin in the curved spacetime",
    ", we introduce a local inertial frame at each point using a vierbein ( or a tetrad ) @xmath6 and its inverse @xmath7 defined by  @xcite @xmath8 and @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the minkowski metric . here and henceforth",
    ", it is assumed that latin letters run over the four inertial - coordinate labels @xmath11 , that greek letters run over the four general - coordinate labels , and that repeated indices are to be summed .",
    "the general - coordinate labels are lowered by @xmath5 and raised by its inverse , @xmath12 , defined by @xmath13 .",
    "the inertial - coordinate labels are lowered by @xmath14 and raised by its inverse , @xmath15 , defined by @xmath16 .",
    "the vierbein represents the coordinate transformation from the general coordinate system @xmath17 to the local inertial frame @xmath18 at each point .",
    "therefore , the vierbein and its inverse transform a tensor in the general coordinate system into one in the local inertial frame , and vice versa . for example , a tensor @xmath19 in the general coordinate system can be transformed into that in the local inertial frame at @xmath17 via the relation @xmath20 . clearly , the choice of the local inertial frame is not unique , since the inertial frame remains inertial under the lorentz transformation .",
    "the choice of the vierbein therefore has the same degree of freedom known as the local lorentz transformation .",
    "in fact , definitions ( [ eq : defe ] ) and ( [ eq : defei ] ) remain unaltered under the local lorentz transformation , i.e. , @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "although this transformation @xmath24 is a lorentz transformation , it has no connection with the lorentz transformation that is included as a special case in the general coordinate transformation .    using the local lorentz transformation",
    ", we can define a particle with spin @xmath4 in curved spacetime .",
    "it is well known that a `` particle '' is not defined uniquely in quantum field theory in curved spacetime  @xcite , since the `` time '' coordinate to define the positive energy is not unique ; this non - uniqueness is an origin of particle creation such as hawking radiation  @xcite .",
    "however , in the present formulation , our particle is specified by the vierbein @xmath25 , which relates the local time to a global time . a spin-@xmath4 particle in curved spacetime",
    "is then defined as a particle whose one - particle states furnish the spin-@xmath4 representation of the local lorentz transformation , not of the general coordinate transformation .",
    "in fact , the dirac field in the curved spacetime  @xcite is spinor under the local lorentz transformation , while it is scalar under the general coordinate transformation . more specifically , consider a massive spin-@xmath4 particle moving with four - velocity @xmath26 , which is normalized as @xmath27 the four - momentum is given by @xmath28 , with @xmath29 being the mass of the particle .",
    "accordingly , the four - momentum in the local inertial frame becomes @xmath30 using the vierbein . in the local inertial frame at point @xmath17 ,",
    "the one - particle state in quantum theory is specified by the third - component @xmath31 ( = @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) of the spin as @xmath34 , as in special relativity .",
    "this state indicates not a localized state at @xmath17 with definite momentum @xmath35 , but rather an extended state whose momentum is @xmath35 if it is viewed in the local inertial frame at @xmath17 . by definition ,",
    "the state @xmath34 transforms as the spin-@xmath4 representation under the local lorentz transformation .",
    "note that , in the case of special relativity , a one - particle state @xmath36 in the spin-@xmath4 representation transforms under a lorentz transformation @xmath37 as  @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a @xmath40 unitary matrix that rotates the spin of the particle according to the wigner rotation @xmath41 .",

    "to get rid of this effect , the observers rotate the directions of the measurement about the @xmath104-axis through the angles @xmath150 , respectively .",
    "that is , the spin component of one particle is measured in the @xmath214-direction ( component @xmath215 ) or in the @xmath206-direction ( component @xmath216 ) , and the spin component of the other is measured in the @xmath217-direction ( component @xmath218 ) or in the @xmath219-direction ( component @xmath220 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the degree of the violation of bell s inequality still decreases as @xmath221 due to acceleration and gravity .",
    "of course , local realistic theories can not be restored , since eq .",
    "( [ eq : relbell ] ) is a consequence of local unitary operations .",
    "this decrease means that it is a different set of directions that maximally violates bell s inequality . to utilize the violation of bell s inequality for quantum communication",
    ", the observers must take into account the general - relativistic effect arising from acceleration and gravity .",
    "more specifically , the spin component of one particle must be measured in the @xmath222-direction or in the @xmath206-direction in the local inertial frame at @xmath147 , and the spin component of the other must be measured in the @xmath223-direction or in the @xmath224-direction in the local inertial frame at @xmath212 .    however , in practice , it becomes difficult to observe the violation of bell s inequality when an uncertainty in @xmath178 is near the horizon .",
    "even if the directions of measurement are adjusted so that bell s inequality is maximally violated , the error in @xmath143 decreases the degree of violation as @xmath225 .",
    "this value must be greater than @xmath104 to verify the violation of bell s inequality .",
    "therefore , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : err ] ) , @xmath177 and @xmath107 must satisfy at least @xmath226 for a given uncertainty @xmath177 , there exists a radius @xmath227 ( @xmath116 ) such that static observers at @xmath228 can not observe the violation of bell s inequality from circularly moving particles . to see the violation of bell s inequality at @xmath228",
    ", the observers must fall into the black hole together with the particles , using the vierbein ( [ eq : kruvb ] ) and the four - velocity ( [ eq : krufv ] ) .    using a different definition of a relativistic spin ,",
    "czachor  @xcite obtained a decrease in the degree of violation of bell s inequality .",
    "this decrease was caused by the inertial motion of particles in minkowski spacetime .",
    "in contrast to this result , bell s inequality is unaffected except for a trivial rotation in our formulation in that case .",
    "czachor s effect is thus different from ours .",
    "terno  @xcite discussed a relation of different choices of relativistic spin operators to the violation of bell s inequalities .",
    "we considered the epr correlation and the violation of bell s inequality with accelerated particles in a gravitational field . using relativistic quantum theory in curved spacetime , we explictly derived the local wigner rotation during the motion of the particle .",
    "considering particles in a circular motion in the schwarzschild spacetime , we showed that acceleration and gravity deteriorate the epr correlation in the directions that are the same in non - relativistic theory , and apparently decrease the degree of the violation of bell s inequality .",
    "this finding indicates neither a breakdown of the non - local correlation nor a restoration of local realistic theories .",
    "in fact , if the spins are measured in appropriately chosen different directions , we can obtain the perfect anti - correlation and the maximal violation of bell s inequality .",
    "our results mean that , in order to utilize the non - local correlation and the violation of bell s inequality for quantum communication , we must take account of the relativistic effect by adjusting the directions of measurement ; otherwise , the accuracy of quantum communication is reduced . in principle , we need information about the four - velocity and the vierbein in order for the communication to be perfect .    moreover , we showed that near the event horizon even a small uncertainty in the identification of observers positions results in a fatal error in identifying the measurement direction needed to maintain the perfect epr correlation , because of an extremely rapid spin precession .",
    "in particular , static observers on the horizon can extract the epr correlation from circularly moving particles only if they have infinite accuracy as to their own positions . to exploit the epr correlation on and beyond the horizon",
    ", the observers must choose a four - velocity and vierbein that are not singular at the horizon , and thus the observers must fall into the black hole together with the particles .",
    "this example demonstrates that the choices of four - velocity and vierbein are important to the ability to communicate non - locally in a curved spacetime using an epr pair of spins .",
