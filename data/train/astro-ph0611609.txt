    "stellar evolution has long shown rather clearly that in the main - sequence ( ms ) region stars burn hydrogen in their cores by a combination of the pp chain and the cno tri - cycle .",
    "the former is the more important in low - mass stars , @xmath2 , and the latter in more massive stars . in the low - mass stars much",
    "@xmath3he is produced in a region outside the main h - burning core , and because the convective core is small or absent in such stars this @xmath3he survives and is mixed ( iben 1967 ) into the surface convection zone ( scz ) as the star ascends the first giant branch ( fgb ) .",
    "the initial abundance of @xmath3he may be increased above its primordial value , taken to be @xmath4 , by a factor of nearly 10 .",
    "1a illustrates the distribution of  ( and other isotopes ) in a @xmath5 pop ii star towards the end of its ms life .",
    "the figure is the result of a 1d ( i.e. spherically symmetric ) calculation .",
    "is enriched above its initial value ( the same as its surface value since this star has only a slight convective envelope ) in a broad peak extending over nearly half the mass of the star .",
    "the peak abundance is a factor of @xmath6 larger than the initial value .",
    "0.1truein 0.2truein .",
    "( a ) profiles of the abundances of certain nuclei in a star which has evolved to roughly the end of the ms . although we only model a pop ii star here , the enrichment of   is just as considerable for relatively metal - rich pop i stars like the sun",
    ".  shows a major peak where the abundance reaches @xmath6 times the initial ( surface ) abundance .",
    "( b ) the same star later , when the scz reaches its maximum inward extent .",
    "the  peak has been homogenized , to a factor of 9 larger than its initial value .",
    "the inert , h - depleted core is about @xmath7 . 0.1truein    in later evolution , a large scz develops which mixes and homogenises the outer @xmath8 ( fig .",
    "the surface   abundance is raised from the initial @xmath9 to @xmath10 , i.e. by a factor of @xmath11 .",
    "later still , as the star climbs the fgb , the scz is diminished by ( a ) nuclear burning below its base , in a zone that marches outwards , and ( b ) stellar - wind mass loss from its surface .",
    "the evidence for the latter is that the next long - lived stage after the fgb is the horizontal branch ( hb ) , and hb stars appear to have masses that are typically @xmath12 , substantially less than the masses of stars capable of evolving to the fgb in less than a hubble time ( faulkner 1966 , 1972 ) .",
    "process ( b ) leads to enrichment of the interstellar medium ( ism ) in   ( steigman et al .",
    "1985 , dearborn et al . 1986 , 1996 ) .",
    "only relatively low - mass stars contribute to this enrichment , because in massive stars the convective core becomes a large enough fraction of the total stellar mass that it mixes the   peak to the center , where the   is burnt to .",
    "roughly , we expect that stars in the mass range @xmath13 are the ones that contribute to  enrichment ; but this is a substantial majority , by combined mass as well as by number , of all stars capable of substantial evolution in the galaxy s lifetime . yet the ism s abundance of , at @xmath14 by mass , is little different from that predicted by big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "this is a major problem ( hata et al .",
    "1995 , olive et al .",
    "1995 ) : either the big bang value is too high , or the evolution of low - mass stars is wrong .    in this paper",
    "we identify a mechanism by which low - mass stars destroy ( on the fgb ) the   that they initially produce during their ms evolution .",
    "amusingly , this mechanism is driven by the  itself , in a narrow zone just above the main hydrogen - burning shell that is characteristic of fgb stars .",
    "once the scz has reached its deepest extent , part - way up from the base of the fgb , it retreats , and can be expected to leave behind a region of uniform composition with the  abundance of @xmath10 as seen in fig .",
    "this region is stable to convection according to the usual schwarzschild criterion , and is quite extensive in radius although small in mass .",
    "the h - burning front moves outwards into the stable region , but preceding the h - burning region proper is a narrow region , usually thought unimportant , in which the  burns .",
    "the reaction that mainly consumes it is @xmath15 which is an unusual reaction in stellar terms because it _ lowers _ the mean molecular weight : two nuclei become three nuclei , and the mean mass per nucleus decreases from 3 to 2 .",
    "the molecular weight being the mean mass per nucleus , but including also the much larger abundances of  and  that are already there and not taking part in this reaction , this leads to an inversion in the molecular - weight gradient .",
    "the effect is tiny ( see fig .",
    "2a , from the same 1d simulation as fig .",
    "1 ) : it is in about the fourth decimal place .",
    "but our 3d modeling shows it to be hydrodynamically unstable , as we should expect from the classic rayleigh - taylor instability .    0.2truein",
    "-3.0truein 2.7truein 0.4truein .",
    "( a ) the profile of ( reciprocal ) molecular weight , on a greatly exaggerated vertical scale , as a function of mass coordinate .",
    "once the burning shell has burnt outwards to the region where the major composition has been homogenized by the previous action of the scz , a small peak due to -burning , just outside the main burning region , begins to stand out .",
    "the peak exists because -burning _ decreases _ the mean molecular weight of the interacting particles .",
    "( b ) a cross - section through the central part of the star at the beginning of the 3d run . mean molecular weight is color - coded , except that the main hydrogen - burning shell is replaced by a red sphere .",
    "the @xmath16-inversion is the marked yellow band . 0.1truein",
    "2a shows the @xmath17 profile plotted against mass coordinate . at a relatively early stage ( red curve )",
    "there is no bump , but just a slight distortion at about 0.286@xmath18 .",
    "this is because the  consunption is taking place in a region where there is still a substantial @xmath16 gradient left over from earlier history .",
    "but as the h - burning shell moves out ( in mass ) , the -burning shell preceding it moves into a region of more uniform /   ratio , and so the peak in @xmath17 begins to stand out . by the time the shell has moved to @xmath19",
    "there is a clear local maximum in @xmath17 , which persists indefinitely as the h - burning shell advances and the convective envelope retreats .    at this point in the evolution of our 1d star",
    "we mapped it on to a 3d model and used the hydrodynamic code ` djehuty ' developed at the lawrence livermore national laboratory ( bazn et al .",
    "2003 , eggleton et al .",
    "2003 , dearborn et al .",
    "this code is described most fully in the third of these papers . although djehuty is designed to deal with an entire star , from center to photosphere , we economised on meshpoints by considering only the region below the scz .",
    "the actual model selected was a pop i star of @xmath20 rather than a pop ii star of @xmath5 , but there is very little difference in regard to the  behavior , and the peak in @xmath17 .",
    "fig 2b is a color - coded plot of @xmath16 on a cross - section through the initial 3d model .",
    "the shell where the @xmath16-inversion occurs is the yellow - orange region sandwiched between a pale green and a rather darker green .",
    "the inversion is at a radius of @xmath21 m .",
    "the base of the scz is at @xmath22 m , well outside the frame , and the surface of the star is at @xmath23 m . notwithstanding the red sphere shown in fig 2b , the entire interior of the the star below the scz was in the computational domain .",
    "fig 3 shows the early development of the initially - spherical shell on which @xmath17 has a constant value near its peak . after only @xmath24secs ,",
    "the surface has begun to dimple , and by @xmath25secs the dimpling is very marked , and the surface has begun to tear .",
    "some points have moved @xmath26 radially , ie @xmath27 m , indicating velocities of @xmath28 m/s .",
    "the mean velocity decreases slightly in the passage from the second to the fourth panel .",
    "other spherical shells , well away from the inversion on either side , show no such dimpling , at least until the influence of the inversion has spread to them .",
    "the motion appears turbulent , and has the effect of diluting the inverse molecular - weight gradient , but it can not eliminate it . as the turbulent region entrains more of the normally stable region outside it yet below the normal convective envelope , it brings in fresh , which burns at the base of this mixing region , thus sustaining the inverse molecular - weight gradient .",
    "ultimately this turbulent region will extend to unite with the normally - convective envelope , so that the considerable reservoir of  there will also be depleted . if its speed of @xmath28 m/s is maintained the time for processed material to reach the classically unstable scz is only about 5 months , while the time to burn through the @xmath29 layer is over @xmath30yrs .",
    "normal convective mixing , as in the usual scz , is a rapid process : it would homogenise the surface layers in a matter of weeks , if it were not already homogeneous by this stage in the star s evolution .",
    "our new mixing process might be expected to be very much slower , but in order to modify progressively the composition in the normal convective envelope it need only operate on roughly the nuclear timescale of the star , which is @xmath31megayear at this point",
    ".    however , small as is the @xmath16 inversion that drives our extra mixing , it produces velocities that are surprisingly large , and in fact comparable to the velocity of the normal convection .",
    "this is for two reasons .",
    "firstly , although we might expect the inversion to be diluted to a trivial amount by the mixing that it produces , it is in fact sustained because the fresh  that is brought in by the mixing is burnt quite rapidly by reaction ( 1 ) inside the inversion .",
    "if @xmath32 is the height of the peak , if @xmath33 is the timescale of mixing due to the turbulent motion , and if @xmath34 is the timescale of -burning in the inversion , then we expect that @xmath32 is diluted by a factor @xmath35 .",
    "we estimate this below , finding values of @xmath36 .",
    "since @xmath37 , the strength of our ` engine ' is roughly @xmath38 .",
    "secondly , the normal convection of the outer envelope is driven by what is in fact only a very small excess of actual temperature gradient over the adiabatic gradient .",
    "the fractional excess of temperature gradient is itself @xmath39 near the base of the scz , and is therefore not , as one might expect , a great deal larger than the fractional deficit in @xmath16 that drives our extra mixing .",
    "thus it is reasonable to expect our extra mixing to produce turbulent velocities of perhaps a tenth of the normal convective mixing .",
    "0.1truein    -0.2truein the development with time of a contour surface of mean molecular weight near the peak in fig .",
    "3 . the contour dimples , and begins to break up , on a timescale of only @xmath40sec . 0.1truein    as a first approximation , we can expect the effect of buoyancy due to @xmath32 to generate a velocity of order @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the local gravity and @xmath43 is the distance an eddy moves before dissolving into the ambient material ; @xmath43 is normally estimated as the pressure scale height . in ordinary convection , near the base of the scz , the equivalent estimate is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the excess temperature , relative to the ambient medium , of an eddy that expands adiabatically on rising . near the base of the scz we have @xmath46m / s@xmath47 , @xmath48 m , @xmath49 , so that @xmath50 m/s . in our first approximation",
    "( 2 ) , we ought to modify @xmath32 by the factor @xmath51 indicated above , and since we can estimate @xmath33 as @xmath52 , our second approximation is @xmath53 we find @xmath54m / s@xmath47 , @xmath55 m , @xmath56s and so @xmath57 m/s .",
    "thus the expected velocity driven by the inverted @xmath16-gradient is barely a modest factor of 2 down on the normal convective velocity near the base of the scz .",
    "this is smaller than the factor of @xmath58 in our first estimate mainly because @xmath59 is an order of magnitude larger near the burning zone than near the base of the scz .",
    "the above argument establishes that the mixing is extended below the classical schwarz- schild limit , and that it is very fast compared to the nuclear timescales of either the hydrogen - burning shell or the -burning reaction .",
    "if the mixing is fast we can make an estimate of the total amount of   that will be destroyed , by approximating the mixing region as homogeneous . beginning with a model near the location where the mechanism starts , and well below the helium flash ( top left in fig .",
    "1 ) the lifetime of the  in a region whose mass coordinate extends from @xmath60 to @xmath61 is @xmath62 where @xmath63 @xmath64 is the fractional local  abundance , and @xmath65 is the thermally - averaged nuclear cross - section times velocity , i.e. reaction rate .",
    "similarly the timescale for the predominantly cno - cycling hydrogen - burning shell is @xmath66 where @xmath67h ) is the fractional hydrogen abundance above the shell and @xmath68 is the local rate of nuclear energy generation .",
    "the result of such integrations over some different mass regions shows that for any region much larger than the -burning region the ratio of lifetimes of  destruction and core - mass growth is constant and approximately 16 .",
    "thus for rapid mixing the  will be destroyed in 16 times as much mass as the hydrogen shell burns through .",
    "we believe that the extra mixing that we have discovered gives a satisfactory answer to the problem mentioned in the second - last paragraph of the introduction that confronts big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "although low - mass stars do indeed produce considerable amounts of  on the ms , this will all be destroyed by the substantially deeper mixing that we now expect on the fgb .",
    "it is somewhat ironic that this deeper mixing is driven by the  itself .",
    "our deeper mixing can also be relevant to further problems that have troubled stellar modelers for several years . according to the classical models of fgb stars",
    ", there is no further modification to the composition in an fgb convective envelope after it has reached its maximum extent early on the fgb . yet",
    "observations persistently suggest that the ratios @xmath69c/@xmath70c and @xmath71n/@xmath70c both increase appreciably as one goes up the fgb ( suntzeff 1993 , kraft 1994 ) . both these ratios can be expected to increase only if the material in the envelope is somehow being processed near the h - burning shell .",
    "our model makes this very likely .",
    "although the @xmath16-inversion that we find is somewhat above the main part of the h - burning shell , it is not far above and we can expect some modest processing of @xmath70c to @xmath69c and @xmath71n . according to weiss & charbonnel ( 2004 ) , it appears to be necessary for some extra mixing to take place beyond the point on the fgb where the scz has penetrated most deeply ; that is exactly the point where our mechanism should start to operate",
    ".    correlations between abundance excesses and deficits of various elements and isotopes in the low - mass evolved stars of globular clusters have been discussed thoroughly in ( kraft 1994 ) .",
    "the subject is complex , and it is hard to distinguish star - to - star variations that may be due to evolution from those that may be due to primordial variation .",
    "evidence exists for both kinds of variation .",
    "however , we expect our mechanism to lead to substantial evolutionary variations .",
    "the @xmath16-inversion that we investigate has not been noted before , to our knowledge ; but even if it has been noted previously it has probably been ignored because it is small , and because traditional 1d models only give turbulent mixing if they are instructed to .",
    "we feel that our investigation demonstrates particularly clearly the virtue of attempting to model in 3d , where the motion evolved naturally , and to a magnitude that initially surprised us .",
    "3d modeling is an expensive exercise , but we believe that it is amply justified . the mixing process that we have identified appears to be capable of solving one cosmological problem and two or more stellar problems .",
