    "already more than a decade ago it was realised that the hadronic decay of the @xmath0 lepton could serve as an ideal system to study low - energy qcd under rather clean conditions @xcite . in the following years",
    ", detailed investigations of the @xmath0 hadronic width as well as invariant mass distributions have served to determine the qcd coupling @xmath6 to a precision competitive with the current world average @xcite .",
    "the experimental separation of the cabibbo - allowed decays and cabibbo - suppressed modes into strange particles opened a means to also determine the mass of the strange quark @xcite , one of the fundamental qcd parameters within the standard model .",
    "these determinations suffer from large qcd corrections to the contributions of scalar and pseudoscalar correlation functions @xcite which are additionally amplified by the particular weight functions which appear in the @xmath0 sum rule . a natural remedy to circumvent this problem is to replace the qcd expressions of scalar and pseudoscalar correlators by corresponding phenomenological hadronic parametrisations @xcite , which turn out to be more precise than their qcd counterparts , since the by far dominant contribution stems from the well known kaon pole .",
    "additional suppressed contributions to the pseudoscalar correlators come from the pion pole as well as higher exited pseudoscalar states whose parameters have recently been estimated @xcite .",
    "the remaining strangeness - changing scalar spectral function has been extracted from a study of s - wave @xmath7 scattering @xcite in the framework of resonance chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the resulting scalar spectral function was also employed to directly determine @xmath2 from a purely scalar qcd sum rule @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , as was already realised in the first works on strange mass determinations from the cabibbo - suppressed @xmath0 decays , @xmath2 turns out to depend sensitively on the element @xmath1 of the quark - mixing ( ckm ) matrix . with the theoretical improvements in the @xmath0 sum rule mentioned above , in fact @xmath1 represents one of the dominant uncertainties for @xmath2 .",
    "thus it appears natural to actually determine @xmath1 with an input for @xmath2 as obtained from other sources @xcite .",
    "very recently , new results on the @xmath0 branching fractions into strange particles have been presented by cleo @xcite and opal @xcite .",
    "in addition , the opal collaboration also presented an update on the strange spectral function , previously known only from aleph @xcite .",
    "both , cleo and opal found @xmath8 $ ] to be significantly higher than the corresponding aleph result .",
    "the important impact of these improved findings on the determination of @xmath1 and @xmath2 will be investigated below .",
    "the main quantity of interest for the following analysis is the hadronic decay rate of the @xmath0 lepton , @xmath9 } { \\gamma[\\tau^-\\to e^-\\bar\\nu_e\\nu_\\tau(\\gamma ) ] } = r_{\\tau , ns } + r_{\\tau , s}\\,,\\ ] ] which experimentally can be decomposed into a component with net - strangeness @xmath10 , and the non - strange part @xmath11 .",
    "additional information can be inferred from the measured invariant mass distribution of the final state hadrons .",
    "the corresponding moments @xmath12 , defined by @xcite @xmath13 can be calculated in complete analogy to @xmath14 . in the framework of the operator product expansion ( ope )",
    ", @xmath12 can be written as @xcite : @xmath15 @xcite has been pulled out explicitly , and @xmath16 denotes the purely perturbative dimension - zero contribution .",
    "the symbols @xmath17 stand for higher dimensional corrections in the ope from dimension @xmath18 operators which contain implicit suppression factors @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the separate measurement of cabibbo - allowed as well as cabibbo - suppressed decay widths of the @xmath0 lepton @xcite allows one to pin down the flavour su(3)-breaking effects , dominantly induced by the strange quark mass . defining the differences",
    "@xmath20 many theoretical uncertainties drop out since these observables vanish in the su(3 ) limit .",
    "employing the su(3)-breaking difference ( [ delrtaukl ] ) , as a first step , we intend to determine @xmath1 .",
    "this approach requires a value for the strange mass from other sources as an input so that we are in a position to calculate @xmath21 from theory . in the following",
    ", we shall use the result @xmath22 , a value compatible with most recent determinations of @xmath2 from qcd sum rules @xcite and lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "the compilation of recent strange mass determinations is displayed in figure  [ fig : ms ] .",
    "for comparison , in figure  [ fig : ms ] , we also display @xmath2 as obtained from our previous @xmath0 sum rule analysis @xcite for the aleph data , as well as this work analysing the opal data .    . for ref",
    "@xcite the given error is only statistical.[fig : ms],width=302 ]    since the sensitivity of @xmath21 to @xmath1 is strongest for the ( 0,0 ) moment , where also the theoretical uncertainties are smallest , this moment will be used for the determination of @xmath1 . inserting the above strange mass value into the theoretical expression for @xmath23 @xcite ,",
    "one finds @xmath24 where the uncertainty dominantly results from a variation of @xmath2 within its errors . employing the above result in eq .",
    "( [ delrtaukl ] ) , together with the experimental findings @xmath25 , @xmath26 @xcite , as well as @xmath27 @xcite , we then obtain @xmath28 the first given error is the experimental uncertainty , dominantly due to @xmath10 , whereas the second error stems from the theoretical quantity @xmath29 . for the extraction of @xmath1 , even though the theoretical error on @xmath29 is 12% , it represents only a small correction compared to @xmath30 and thus its error is suppressed .",
    "the theoretical uncertainty in @xmath29 will only start to matter once the experimental error on @xmath10 is much improved , possibly through analyses of the babar and belle @xmath0 data samples .",
    "one further remark is in order .",
    "a sizeable fraction of the strange branching ratio is due to the decay @xmath31 , for which opal used the pdg fit result @xmath32=(0.686\\pm0.023)\\%$ ] @xcite .",
    "however , this decay can be predicted employing its relation to the decay @xmath33 , which theoretically is known rather well @xcite .",
    "updating the numerics of refs .",
    "@xcite , we then obtain @xmath32=(0.715\\pm0.004)\\%$ ] , much more precise than the experimental value . adding this result to the remaining strange branching fractions ,",
    "one finds @xmath34 , which would lead to @xmath35 .",
    "employing the above calculated value for @xmath1 , we are now in a position to determine the strange quark mass @xmath2 from the su(3)-breaking difference of eq .",
    "( [ delrtaukl ] ) .",
    "experimentally , various @xmath36 moments have been determined @xcite . for low @xmath37 ,",
    "the higher - energy region of the experimental spectrum , which is less well known , plays a larger role and thus in this region the experimental uncertainties dominate the strange mass determination , whereas for higher @xmath37 more emphasis is put on the lower - energy region , and there the theoretical uncertainties dominate . at present , the most reliable results for @xmath2 are obtained from the moments @xmath38 to @xmath39 , and we shall only discuss these here .",
    ".central results for @xmath40 extracted from the different moments , as well as ranges for the main input parameters and resulting uncertainties for @xmath2.[tab1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the analysis proceeds in complete analogy to our previous work @xcite . in table",
    "[ tab1 ] , we show a detailed account of our results .",
    "the first row displays the values of @xmath40 obtained from the different moment sum rules and central values for all input parameters . in the following rows",
    ", we have listed those input parameters which dominantly contribute to the uncertainty on @xmath2 , the ranges for these parameters used in our analysis and the resulting shift in @xmath2 .",
    "only those parameters have been included in the list which at least for one moment yield a shift of @xmath2 larger than @xmath41 .",
    "finally , in the last row , we display the total error that results from adding the individual uncertainties in quadrature .    taking a weighted average of the strange mass values obtained for the different moments",
    "we then find @xmath42 where the uncertainty corresponds to that of the ( 4,0 ) moment .",
    "the dominant theoretical uncertainties in the result of eq .",
    "( [ ms ] ) originate from higher order perturbative corrections as well as the su(3)-breaking ratio of the quark condensates @xmath43 @xcite which arises in the dimension-4 contribution to eq .",
    "( [ delrtaukl ] ) . a detailed discussion of all input parameters can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in our previous analysis @xcite , based on the aleph data @xcite , it was observed that @xmath2 displayed a strong dependence on the number of the moment @xmath37 , decreasing with increasing @xmath37 , and it was speculated that this behaviour could be due to missing contributions in the higher energy region of the spectrum @xcite . with the recent cleo and opal data @xcite , finding a larger branching fraction of the @xmath44 mode , the decrease of @xmath2 is now much reduced , although still visible .",
    "this issue needs to be clarified further once even better data are available .",
    "in principle , it is also possible to perform a simultaneous fit to @xmath1 and @xmath2 from a certain set of @xmath36 moments .",
    "as soon as more precise data are available , this will be the ultimate approach to determine @xmath1 and @xmath2 from hadronic @xmath0 decays . with the current uncertainties in the data and",
    "the question about a monotonous @xmath37-dependence of @xmath2 , a bias could be present in the method .",
    "furthermore , the correlations between different moments are rather strong and also have to be included on the theory side .    here",
    ", we shall restrict ourselves to a simplified approach where all correlations are neglected .",
    "for the simultaneous fit of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , we employ the five @xmath12 moments @xmath45 to @xmath39 which have also been used in our previous analysis @xcite . performing this exercise , for the central values",
    "we find : @xmath46 ) and ( [ ms ] ) , but only slightly since the correlations between different moments are rather strong .",
    "the general trend of the fit result can be understood easily .",
    "@xmath2 from the opal data turned out lower than our global average @xmath47 considered in section  3 . thus , also the corresponding @xmath29 is lower , resulting in a slight reduction of @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , the moment - dependence of @xmath2 is reduced in the fit . nevertheless , leaving a detailed error analysis for a forthcoming publication @xcite , at present , we consider eqs .",
    "( [ vus ] ) and ( [ ms ] ) as our central results .",
    "taking advantage of the strong sensitivity of the flavour - breaking @xmath0 sum rule on the ckm matrix element @xmath1 , it is possible to determine @xmath1 from hadronic @xmath0 decay data .",
    "this requires a value of the strange quark mass as an input which can be obtained from other sources like qcd sum rules or the lattice .",
    "the result for @xmath1 thus obtained is @xmath48 where the error is largely dominated by the experimental uncertainty on @xmath10 , and thus should be improvable with the babar and belle @xmath0 data sets in the near future .",
    "already now , our result is competitive with the standard extraction of @xmath1 from @xmath5 decays @xcite and a new determination from @xmath49 as extracted from the lattice @xcite . the resulting deviation from ckm unitarity",
    "then is @xmath50 being consistent with unitarity at the @xmath51 level .    for the strange mass determination",
    ", we have used the three moments @xmath38 to @xmath39 , with the result @xmath52 our value for @xmath2 is on the low side of previous strange mass determinations , but certainly compatible with them .",
    "it is also on the borderline of being compatible with lower bounds on @xmath2 from sum rules @xcite .",
    "finally , we have performed a simultaneous fit of @xmath1 and @xmath2 to the five moments @xmath45 to @xmath39 .",
    "our central values are completely compatible with the central results of eqs .",
    "( [ vus ] ) and ( [ ms ] ) . anticipating a detailed analysis of the correlations between different moments , these findings should be considered as an indication of the prospects for the future when more precise experimental data will become available .",
