    "current models of galaxy formation and assembly can be characterised by two extreme and competing views .",
    "one such view is represented by the early `` monolithic collapse '' model , whereby the spheroidal ( bulge ) components of galaxies form by the early collapse of individual gas clouds ( e.g. larson 1974 ; carlberg 1984 ) . in these early collapse models the star formation induced by the collapse is terminated when the source of gas is either consumed or expelled from the galaxy .",
    "the bulge then ages passively ( albeit perhaps subject to the later addition of a disk ) .",
    "such models are largely motivated by the small scatter in the observed relationships between colour and magnitude ( e.g. baum 1959 ; bower , lucy & ellis 1992a , b ) and velocity dispersion , surface brightness and size ( the fundamental plane ; dressler et al .",
    "1987 ) for early - type galaxies and bulges . to explain the tightness of these relations , early collapse models require that star formation in bulges terminates at early times ( z@xmath52 ; bower , lucy & ellis 1992a , b ) , so that bulge dominated ( e.g. elliptical ) galaxies should be uniformly old .",
    "this picture faces challenges on a number of fronts .",
    "for instance , the differing slopes found for the fundamental plane in various bands ( e.g. bernardi et al .",
    "2003b ) are difficult to explain in the monolithic collapse scenario .",
    "furthermore , spectroscopic studies of the stellar populations in the bulges of galaxies find central ages ranging from @xmath0115 gyr ( e.g. trager et al .",
    "2000 ; proctor & sansom 2002 ; terlevich & forbes 2002 : caldwell , rose & concannon 2003 ; kauffmann et al .",
    "2003a , b ; proctor et al .",
    "2004b ) , indicating evidence for more recent star formation .",
    "however , by far the most important challenge to the early collapse picture is the fundamental differences in galaxy formation and assembly histories that are predicted when the growth of structure via gravitational instability is modelled for a dark matter - dominated universe , now characterised extremely well via precision measurements of the cosmological parameters ( e.g. the @xmath6cdm model ; spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) . such `` hierarchical '' models , which represent the other extreme view , predict galaxy - mass objects to be assembled by the successive merging of lower - mass objects via hierarchical merging ( white & rees 1978 ) , usually over an extended period .    another important prediction of hierarchical merging models is that the merger rate of galaxies is a function of environment , i.e. on average , galaxies in the dense environs of clusters merge early , while those in the less dense ` field ' merge later ( kauffmann 1996 ) . in the hierarchical merging scenario",
    "the properties of galaxies are therefore subject to strong influences from their environment .",
    "results from stellar population studies appear to confirm the prediction of hierarchical merging models in that ` field ' galaxies possess slightly younger central ages than their cluster counterparts ( e.g. thomas et al .",
    ", 2005 ; bernardi et al . , 2006 ; smith et al . ,",
    "2006 ) .",
    "in contrast to early collapse models , hierarchical merging models predict galaxy bulges to possess a range of ages , with low - mass galaxies forming earlier , and on shorter timescales , than high - mass galaxies . at first glance",
    ", the wide range of ages observed in spectroscopic studies might also appear to confirm the hierarchical merging predictions , however the observed trend of age with mass is for lower - mass systems to be _ younger _ than higher - mass systems .",
    "this is inconsistent with hierarchical merging models which predict lower - mass systems to form earlier than high - mass system ( kauffmann 1996 ) .",
    "the observed trend is therefore sometimes referred to as ` anti - hierarchical ' .",
    "the recent de lucia et al .",
    "( 2006 ) analysis of the millennium simulation provides insights important to the development of a coherent picture of galaxy evolution .",
    "the millennium simulation models the evolution of dark matter using an n - body code to which de lucia et al .",
    "couple a semi - analytic model of galaxy formation .",
    "de lucia et al s analysis clearly demonstrates that a strong distinction must be made between the _ mass assembly _ of galaxies and the _ formation _ of their stellar populations .",
    "this can be understood intuitively by the simple realisation that mergers bring old stars into a merger remnant as well as making new stars .",
    "merger remnants may therefore be , and often are , still dominated ( in terms of their mass ) by old stellar populations .",
    "de lucia et al . conclude that while the mass assembly of galaxies is indeed hierarchical , their star formation histories are nevertheless anti - hierarchical . despite this improvement in our theoretical understanding ,",
    "the problem remains how to reconcile the broad range of predicted ( and spectroscopically observed ) galaxy ages with the extremely small scatter in some scaling relations .",
    "recent surveys of large numbers of nearby galaxies have provided statistically significant results and hence further observational constraints on galaxy formation models .",
    "such surveys include the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs : colless et al .",
    "2001b ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) . from central region spectra and global optical colours",
    "the 2dfgrs probed the cosmic star formation history at relatively low redshift ( baldry et al .",
    "2002 ) and its variation with local environmental density ( lewis et al .",
    "the sdss also obtained optical colours and central spectra for a large number of low redshift galaxies .",
    "this ongoing dataset has been used by several authors to study the star formation history and scaling relations of nearby galaxies .",
    "these studies include bernardi et al .",
    "( 2003b ) who investigated scaling relations for @xmath09,000 galaxies , eisenstein et al .",
    "( 2003 ) who combined spectra of 22,000 massive galaxies , gallazzi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) who probed the star formation history of @xmath040,000 galaxies , cid fernandes et al .",
    "( 2005 ) who conducted a spectral synthesis of @xmath050,000 galaxies , and chang et al .",
    "( 2006 ) who combined spectra and optical colours with 2mass near - infrared colours for @xmath03,000 galaxies .",
    "such large datasets have allowed these authors to investigate trends as a function of mass , environment , galaxy type etc .",
    "already , a galaxy mass - metallicity relation has been detected in the metallicities of both gas ( tremonti et al .",
    "2004 ) and stars ( gallazzi et al . 2005 ) and strong trends with galaxy environment identified ( lewis et al . 2002 ) .",
    "however , the above studies have not explicitly explored the link between the _ central _ stellar populations , which they observe , and the _ global _ photometry of the galaxies in their samples .",
    "it is this issue that this paper specifically addresses . to this end",
    ", we compare the results of stellar population analysis of spectra from the 6df galaxy survey ( 6dfgs ; jones et al .",
    "2004 ) to the global near - infrared photometry of the 2mass extended source catalog ( 2mass xsc ; jarrett et al . 2000a , b ) and optical supercosmos ( hambly , irwin & macgillivray .",
    "2001 ) data for several thousand galaxies .",
    "we explore such issues as the fraction of galaxies stellar populations that can have been formed in recent star formation events and the effects of stellar populations on the slopes of colour - magnitude relations and the varying ` tilt ' of the fundamental plane .",
    "the paper is laid out as follows . in the next section we outline the photometric and spectroscopic data . in section [ spectroscopicanal ]",
    "we detail the spectroscopic data reductions and analysis used to derive stellar population parameters .",
    "section [ results ] presents the results of our analysis , which are discussed and summarised in section [ concs ] .",
    "the 6dfgs is a spectroscopic survey of the entire southern sky more than 10 degrees from the galactic plane .",
    "the survey measured redshifts for more than 124,000 galaxies .",
    "the primary survey targets were selected primarily from the 2mass extended source catalog ( xsc ) .",
    "all galaxies brighter than k@xmath7=12.75 were included in the sample .",
    "secondary samples of 2mass and supercosmos galaxies , complete down to magnitude limits ( h ,  j ,  r@xmath8 ,  b@xmath9 )  =  ( 13.00 ,  13.75 ,  15.60 ,  16.75 ) , were also included .",
    "the survey was carried out on the uk schmidt telescope using the six - degree field ( 6df ) multi - fibre spectrograph .",
    "the 6df instrument simultaneously observed up to 150 spectra over a 5.7@xmath10  field .",
    "the science fibres of the instrument were 6.7 arcsec in diameter .",
    "the spectrograph is bench mounted in an enclosure inside the telescope dome , which gives it increased instrumental stability compared to a spectrographs mounted on a telescope ( e.g. 2df and the sdss spectrograph ) .",
    "this increased instrumental stability maintains consistent instrumental resolution , which is important when working with lick indices .",
    "the survey obtained spectra in the visual ( v ) and red ( r ) wavelength ranges providing coverage from @xmath04000 to @xmath08400 .",
    "the spectra have 5 - 6  fwhm resolution in v and 9 - 12  resolution in r ( see jones et al .",
    "2004 for more details ) .",
    "the main science aims of the survey included : to measure the luminosity function of near - infrared selected galaxies as a function of environment and galaxy type ( jones et al .",
    "2006 ) , to measure the clustering of galaxies , to produce detailed maps of the density and peculiar velocity fields of the nearby universe ( jones et al . 2004",
    "; erdogdu et al .",
    "2006 ) and to study the properties of the underlying stellar population of the galaxies such as ages and chemical abundances .",
    "it is this latter issue to which this paper is addressed .    the 6dfgs is particularly suited to the aims of the current study because the selection criteria using 2mass near - infrared photometry provides a sample less biased toward bright , young galaxies than surveys based on optical catalogues .",
    "the k band photometry also has the useful property of being relatively insensitive to both metallicity the presence of dust ( unlike optical bands ) , and is therefore an good tracer of mass .",
    "it also provides a useful tool in breaking the age  metallicity degeneracy .",
    "finally , 6dfgs spectra are obtained from region 2 to 3 times larger on the sky than those used in the 2dfgrs and sdss surveys . as a result ,",
    "at the mean redshifts of the surveys , 2df , sdss and 6dfgs fibres correspond to 2.6 , 3.9 and 4.6 kpc / h respectively .",
    "the 6dfgs spectra therefore sample a significantly larger fraction of the total galaxy light than either 2df or sdss spectra .",
    "the spectroscopic data presented here are from the 6dfgs first data release ( jones et al .",
    "lick index , velocity dispersion and emission line - strength measurements were made on all galaxies with redshift quality  @xmath11 ( the ` reliable ' redshifts ; jones et al .",
    "this gave a total of 39649 galaxies with 3859 of these observed more than once ( 420 galaxies observed more than twice ) .",
    "if a galaxy was observed more than once , only the highest signal - to - noise - ratio spectrum was used for the measurements .",
    "however , repeat observations were used to establish the errors ( see section [ error_measurement ] ) .",
    "only galaxies with median signal - to - noise ratios @xmath512 @xmath12 were deemed suitable for age and metallicity determinations .",
    "such a value lies at the lower limit of signal - to - noise - ratio that can be used to derive ages and metallicities with precision .",
    "the above selection criteria resulted in @xmath07000 galaxies suitable for lick index measurements .",
    "it should be noted that , as no morphological selection was made , the results presented here include galaxies of the full range of early and late types .",
    "+      the k band magnitudes used in this work were taken to be the k@xmath7 values estimated from the 2mass data by jones et al .",

    "this option allows the fitting of gaussians to a series of spectral lines and the measurement of the value of the equivalent widths of each .",
    "the strengths of h@xmath31  and the two [ nii ] doublet lines either side of it were measured in this way from continuum divided spectra .",

    "the sample is sometimes subdivided into ` passive ' ( no emission ) and ` emission ' galaxies .",
    "passive galaxies are defined as those in which no emission lines are detected within the 6dfgs wavelength range with greater than approximately 1-@xmath32 significance .",
    "emission line galaxies are therefore defined as those in which at least one emission line is detected at greater than one sigma confidence . for h@xmath28 this criterion corresponds to emission - line equivalent widths of @xmath01.5  . using this definition",
    "the sample contains 4640 passive galaxies and 2270 emission galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , a full analysis of morphological types is not available for the sample .",
    "however , visual inspection of a sub - sample of passive galaxies suggests that @xmath080% are early types , while amongst the emission galaxies a similar fraction are late types .",
    "the method used to measure lick indices from appropriately broadened spectra and to correct the indices for the broadening effect of a galaxy s velocity dispersion was based on that used by stephen moore ( 2001 )    measurements of the velocity dispersion in the 6dfgs galaxy spectra were made using the iraf task _ fxcor _ which carries out a fourier cross  correlation between the object spectrum and a zero - redshift , zero - velocity dispersion template spectrum .",
    "the task outputs the radial velocity of the object spectrum and the fwhm of the fourier correlation peak between the object and template spectra , which can be converted into a velocity dispersion .",
    "the template spectra used were three velocity standard stars observed with the 6df spectrograph in 2003 march by craig harrison ( hr2574 , hr3145 and hr5888 , which are late g and early k giants ) .",
    "the raw values of the velocity dispersion measured by _ fxcor _ need to be calibrated . to do this each of the standard star spectra",
    "were artificially broadened to a specific velocity dispersion using the iraf task _",
    "gauss_. these artificially broadened spectra were then used to calibrate their ( known ) velocity dispersions against the value measured by _",
    "fxcor_. towards lower velocity dispersions , as one approaches the instrumental velocity resolution ( @xmath33100  km  s@xmath12 ) , this calibration becomes less accurate .",
    "however , galaxies with such low velocity dispersions require only very small corrections to their measured lick index values .",
    "consequently , reliable index determinations can still be obtained in low velocity dispersion galaxies .",
    "more importantly , this method of measuring velocity dispersion fails on galaxies that are not well fit by the standard star templates .",
    "this mainly occurs in low signal - to - noise ratio galaxy spectra with young ages and/or strong emission lines .",
    "a comparison of velocity dispersion values derived from the 6dfgs spectra to values in the literature ( hyperleda ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ vdisp_comp ] .",
    "the 6dfgs values show good agreement with the literature values with an average offset of 6.1  kms@xmath12 , and an rms scatter of 20  kms@xmath12 .",
    "both deviation and scatter are greatest at high velocity dispersion , where we find the hyperlead values to be consistently greater than the 6dfgs values .",
    "this is in agreement with bernardi ( 2007 ) who found hyperleda values greater than values derived from the sdss at high velocity dispersion .    given the large 6df aperture ( 6.7 arcsec compared to a more typical 2 or 3 arcsec in hyperleda ) it is possible that these deviations are the results of aperture effects .",
    "jrgensen et al .",
    "( 1995 ) investigated the effects of varying the aperture size in observations of velocity dispersions in the inner regions ( i.e. r @xmath33 r@xmath34 ) of early - type galaxies .",
    "their results showed a weak power law dependence of measured velocity dispersions with the size of aperture .",
    "we therefore experimented with correcting velocity dispersions according to jrgensen et al .",
    "( 1995 ) in the sub - sample of 6dfgs galaxies for which hyperlead values were also available . as this subsample of the data is heavily biased to nearby , early - type galaxies , it is well matched to the galaxies used to calibrate the jrgensen et al .",
    "( 1995 ) relation .",
    "the results showed that while the offset was reduced to + 0.75  kms@xmath12 , the scatter was increased to 23  kms@xmath12 .",
    "we also note that the trend for hyperleda values to be greater than values derived from our data remains unaffected by these corrections .    as noted above , the jrgensen et al .",
    "( 1995 ) correction is calibrated for the inner regions of early - type galaxies . however , for our 6dfgs sample as a whole , the _ average _ aperture is @xmath01  r@xmath15 ( see fig .",
    "[ sample ] ) .",
    "the sample also contains both early- and late - type galaxies .",
    "this suggests that the corrections presented by jrgensen et al .",
    "( 1995 ) are inappropriate for the 6df sample as a whole .",
    "for such a sample , it is instead informative to consider the study of gebhardt et al .",
    "this analysis of the variation in observed velocity dispersions ( including the effects of rotation ) measured through circular apertures of varying radius in a sample of 26 galaxies of mixed hubble types shows that , within 5  r@xmath15 , the sample exhibits little or no systematic variation of the measured velocity dispersion with aperture size .    as a result of the considerations above ,",
    "we have elected to make no corrections for aperture size to the measured velocity dispersion values within this work .",
    "+      to make lick index measurements suitable for direct comparison with single stellar population ( ssp ) models , it is necessary to broaden the spectra to the instrumental resolution of the lick / ids system . the lick / ids fwhm instrumental resolution as a function of wavelength is described in worthey & ottaviani ( 1997 ) where it is shown to vary from @xmath08.5    at the central wavelength ( @xmath05000   ) to @xmath010    at the spectrum ends ( @xmath04000 and 6000   ) .    the calculation of the necessary broadening requires the measurement of the 6df instrumental resolution .",
    "this was measured from 6df arc line spectra obtained from the observational time - span of the 6dfgs first data release .",
    "the instrumental resolution of the 6df spectra varies not only with wavelength but also with optical fibre number , so measurements were made of arc lines at various wavelengths , _ for all fibres individually_. a bivariate polynomial was fit to the measured fwhm spectral resolution as a function of both wavelength and fibre number .",
    "the amount of broadening required to match the lick / ids resolution could then be estimated and each 6df spectrum was broadened to this resolution .",
    "the index values given in stellar population models do not include the effect of the velocity dispersion broadening present in galaxy spectra .",
    "it is therefore necessary to introduce a correction to the observed galaxy index values to account for this effect .    to measure the velocity dispersion correction required for each lick index , we measured the indices of a range of artificially broadened stellar spectra .",
    "these values of the lick indices measured in the broadened spectra were then compared to those measured in the un - broadened spectra to determine the index corrections for a range of velocity dispersions .",
    "for each index measured in angstroms ( e.g. the fe and ca indices ) a multiplicative correction was defined by :    @xmath35    while , for each index measured in magnitudes ( e.g. cn@xmath36 , cn@xmath37 , mg@xmath36 , mg@xmath37 ) , an additive corrections was defined by :    @xmath38    where index@xmath39 is the value of the index in the raw stellar spectrum ( i.e. with no broadening ) and index@xmath40 is the index value after broadening of the stellar spectrum to a specific velocity dispersion @xmath41 .    for each index",
    ", quadratic lines were fitted to the velocity dispersion versus index correction ratio data .",
    "the index correction required for a particular galaxy could then be determined from the measured velocity dispersion and the quadratic function .      estimating errors for spectroscopic measurements is notoriously difficult , mainly because there are several sources of error that can not be well quantified ( e.g. sky - subtraction , poor flux calibration etc ) .",
    "therefore , instead of trying to propagate variance arrays , comparisons of the values from repeated 6dfgs observations of the same galaxy were used to quantify this error .",

    "the differences in values were grouped into bins based on the median signal - to - noise ratio of the galaxy spectra .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio of the lower of the two observations was used for this binning , as this observation would be the cause of most of the error .",
    "if a galaxy had been observed more than twice then the two highest signal - to - noise ratio spectra were used .",
    "the rms of each signal - to - noise ratio bin was determined and used as the @xmath42 value . to remove the biasing effect of large outliers in the bins only the lowest 95.45% of the values ( the @xmath43 limit ) in each bin was used to calculated the rms value .",
    "this requires that the rms be scaled up by 1.164 to take into account this clipping .",
    "a function was fitted to the rms of the bins against the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the fitting function used was a modified rectangular hyperbola of the form @xmath44 ( ` a ' and ` b ' the fitted coefficients ) . the error in any measured quantity for a galaxy could then be estimated using the signal - to - noise ratio of the spectrum and the corresponding error from the fitted function .",
    "examples of this procedure can be seen in figure [ error_snr ] .",
    "we note that the majority of the sample with repeat measurements were re - sampled due to the low signal - to - noise of the original observation .",
    "we used the @xmath45-fitting procedure of proctor & sansom ( 2002 ) ( see also proctor et al .",
    "2004a , b and proctor et al . 2005 ) to measure the derived parameters : log(age ) , [ fe / h ] , [ z / h ] and [ e / fe ] ( a proxy for the ` @xmath28'abundance ratio ; see thomas et al .",
    "2003 for details ) .",
    "briefly , the technique for deriving these parameters involves the simultaneous comparison of as many observed indices as possible to models of single stellar populations ( ssps ) .",
    "the best fit is found by minimising the square of the deviations between observations and models in terms of the observational errors ( i.e. @xmath45 ) .",
    "the rationale behind this approach is that , while all indices show some degeneracy with respect to each of the derived parameters , each index does contain _ some _ information regarding each parameter .",
    "in addition , such an approach should be relatively robust with respect to many problems that are commonly experienced in the measurement of spectral indices and their errors .",
    "these include poor flux calibration , poor sky subtraction , poorly constrained velocity dispersions , poor calibration to the lick system and emission - line contamination .",
    "this robustness is of particular importance in the analysis of large numbers of pipe - line reduced spectra such as those of the 6dfgs which can not be flux calibrated and so are not fully calibrated to the lick system .",
    "the method is also relatively robust with respect to the uncertainties in the ssp models used in the interpretation of the measured indices ; e.g. the second parameter effect in horizontal branch morphologies and the uncertainties associated with the asymptotic giant branch .",
    "it was shown in proctor et al .",
    "( 2004a ) and proctor et al .",
    "( 2005 ) that the results derived using the @xmath45 technique are , indeed , significantly more reliable than those based on only a few indices .    in order to carry out the comparison of observations to ssp models it was first necessary to select and interpolate the models provided in the literature .",
    "interpolations are required because models in the literature are presented at only five or six discrete metallicities over the @xmath02.5  dex range .",
    "we experimented with a number of different models ( bruzual & charlot 2003 ( hereafter bc03 ) ; thomas , maraston & bender 2003 ; thomas , maraston & korn 2004 and korn , maraston & thomas 2005 ( hereafter kmt05 ) .",
    "the results presented here are those from the models of kmt05 , as these provide the necessary coverage in age ( 0.1 to 15 gyr ) and metallicity ( [ z / h ] from 2.3 to + 0.67 ) , as well as including a detailed modelling of the effects on indices of varying ` @xmath28'abundance ratios .",
    "however , fits were also obtained to the other model sets for comparison .    the process by which the best fits were obtained was iterative .",
    "first , fits were obtained for all galaxies using _ all _ the available indices .",
    "the pattern of deviations from the fit so obtained was then used to identify indices that matched the models poorly ( see fig .",
    "[ chis ] ) . due to the problem of emission - line filling of the h@xmath46 , h@xmath47 and h@xmath29 balmer lines in emission galaxies",
    ", we considered ` passive ' and ` emission ' galaxies ( section [ meas_em_lines ] ) separately . in fig .",
    "[ chis ] emission galaxies show the expected large deviation between observed and best fit model values of balmer indices and fe5015 ( which is also emission - line affected ) .",
    "these indices were therefore omitted from the fitting procedure in emission galaxies .",
    "perhaps surprisingly , h@xmath29 and fe5015 also deviate significantly in the ` passive ' galaxies .",
    "we take this to indicate that , despite the rather severe definition of emission galaxies outlined in section [ meas_em_lines ] , at least some of the passive galaxies contain low - level emission that has escaped detection during our emission line measurements . indeed , this was the main motivation for the stringent definition of emission - galaxies .",
    "to minimise the effects of this low - level emission on our age and metallicity estimates , age sensitive h@xmath29 and metallicity sensitive fe5015 indices were also excluded from the fits to passive galaxy data .    in both passive and emission galaxies ca4455 was found to fall below best - fit model values .",
    "this effect has been noted in previous studies ( e.g. proctor & sansom 2002 ; clemens et al 2006 ) . the flux - calibration sensitive mg@xmath36 and mg@xmath37 indices were also found to deviate from best fit model values .",
    "this was an anticipated effect , as 6dfgs spectra are only approximately flux calibrated and mg@xmath36 and mg@xmath37 have widely space pseudo - continuum bands .",
    "ca4455 , mg@xmath36 and mg@xmath37 were therefore excluded from the fitting procedure .",
    "fortunately , most of the information lost by the exclusion of the mg@xmath36 and mg@xmath37 indices is captured in the mgb index that is not sensitive to flux - calibration issues .",
    "once poorly fitting indices had been identified and omitted , the fitting of the remaining indices was carried out using a clipping procedure in which indices deviating from the model fit by more than 3@xmath32 were excluded , and the fitting procedure performed again .",
    "this results in an average of less than one additional index per galaxy being clipped from the fits .",
    "most of the clipped indices could be associated with contamination from features such as the 5577    sky - line .",
    "the resultant fits are based on between 10 and 15 indices and show good agreement between observed and best - fit values ( fig .",
    "[ chis ] ) . indeed , the reduced-@xmath45 values given in fig .",
    "[ chis ] ( @xmath48 ) were 1.08 and 1.30 for passive- and emission - galaxies respectively .",
    "this clearly indicates that our data are well represented by the models and that our errors reflect well the differences between observations and models .      for each galaxy in the sample , errors in log(age ) and [ z / h ]",
    "were estimated using 50 monte - carlo realisations of the best - fit model indices , assuming the observational errors for the galaxy in question .",
    "we again note that the reduced-@xmath45 values of both passive- and emission - galaxies were close to one , indicating that the assumed errors reflect the average differences between observations and models quite well .",
    "the rms scatter in the log(age ) and [ z / h ] values of the 50 realisations was therefore taken as the individual galaxy error . however , in an effort to better understand the detailed behaviour of the errors , deviations from the best - fit log(age ) and [ z / h ] values of all 50 realisations of each galaxy were retained and are presented in section [ azerr ] . for the purposes of the following analysis",
    "it is important that the derived ages are well defined .",
    "@xmath0  1000 low signal - to - noise galaxies whose error in log(age ) exceeded 0.3  dex were deemed unreliable and were excluded from the analysis .",
    "the average errors for the remaining galaxies were @xmath00.15  dex in both log(age ) and [ z / h ] .",
    "emission lines can be used to separate star - burst and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) galaxies using the [ oiii]@xmath305007/h@xmath29[nii]/h@xmath28 diagnostic .",
    "values of the [ oiii]@xmath305007 , [ nii ] and h@xmath28 emission strengths were estimated from the 6dfgs spectra in a traditional manner ( section [ meas_em_lines ] ) .",
    "the strength of h@xmath29 emission , however , was taken to be the deviation between the measured value of the h@xmath29 index and the best - fit ssp model value .",
    "due to the relatively small observed dynamical range of h@xmath29 in absorption compared to that observed in emission , this is a fairly robust estimate of h@xmath29 emission .",

    "about 2200 of the 2700 emission galaxies in our sample have reliable estimates of all four of these emission lines , 300 of these lying in the region of the diagram associated with agn as defined by kewley et al .",
    "+      in this section we outline the results of our age and metallicity determinations using lick indices .",
    "the distribution of ages and metallicities are presented in fig .",
    "the sample has been sub - divided into passive- and emission - galaxies as described in section [ meas_em_lines ] .",
    "emission - galaxies classified as agn ( section [ emlingal ] ) are shown as grey symbols , the remainder are plotted in black .    before interpreting this plot",
    ", we must note the apparent clusterings and ` zones - of - avoidance ' , the clearest examples of which are evident in the emission galaxy plot .",
    "these are the inevitable result of linear interpolations in non - rectilinear spaces .",
    "returning attention to the actual results of our age and metallicity determinations ; similar trends of increasing [ z / h ] with decreasing log(age ) are evident in both of passive and emission galaxies  albeit with emission galaxies tending to younger ages .",
    "galaxies classified as possessing agn in section [ emlingal ] also often possess young central ages .",
    "we investigate the effect of aperture size on derived parameter using fig .",
    "[ aperture ] . in these plots ,",
    "the galaxies with the largest and smallest sizes ( r@xmath4937.5 arcsec and r@xmath507.5 arcsec ) are shown as red and blue points respectively . the blue points therefore represent the galaxies in which the 6.7 arcsec aaomega aperture encompasses the largest fraction of galaxy light ( on average @xmath03.0  r@xmath15 ) , while the red points represent galaxies in which the smallest fraction of galaxy light ( @xmath00.5  r@xmath15 ) is encompassed by the fibre . the observed age ",
    "metallicity and age  velocity dispersion relations can be seen to be similar in these two extremes , with the most noticeable difference a slightly higher [ z / h ] ( by @xmath00.1  dex ) in large galaxies .",
    "we therefore find aperture - size effects to be generally small .    due to the large",
    ", circular aperture of the 6dfgs , a direct comparison with the literature , which are mainly based on long - slit observations of galaxy centres , is not straight forward .",
    "nevertheless , we note that the observed trend is at least qualitatively in agreement with the trends observed in previous studies ( trager et al .",
    "2000 ; proctor & sansom 2002 ; mehlert et al . 2003 ; gallazzi et al .",
    "2005 ; collobert et al .",
    "the young central ages of agn are also consistent with studies in the literature showing that star - bursts are often found to accompany agn activity ( e.g. see cid fernandes et al .",
    "2004 and references therein ) .",
    "an intriguing feature of fig . [ agez ] is the presence of a few old galaxies with extremely low [ z / h ] values , ( @xmath330.5 dex ) .",
    "these galaxies , present in both passive and emission samples , possess a range of velocity dispersions .",
    "visual inspection of both spectra and photometry generally reveals nothing exceptional about these galaxies .",
    "further analysis of these galaxies are beyond the scope of this paper , but we note that their low numbers result in them having no impact on the results and conclusions of the present paper .    as in these literature studies , the slope in the age  metallicity relation exhibited by our data is similar to the slope of the age ",
    "metallicity degeneracy ( worthey 1994 ; ` the 3/2 rule ' ) .",
    "before comparing these results with the photometry , it is therefore clearly important to establish that the age ",
    "metallicity degeneracy has been broken . to this end , in the following section we consider the errors in the derived parameters .",
    "as described in section [ errdps ] , errors in age and metallicity were characterised by considering the results of the 50 monte - carlo realisations of each of the 7000 galaxies in our sample .",
    "fits using both the index combinations shown in fig .",
    "[ chis ] ( with and without balmer lines ) were carried out for the purposes of this analysis ( a total of approximately one million realisations ) .",
    "the differences between the input - model values of log(age ) and [ z / h ] and those of each of the realisations were calculated .",
    "these were combined in a number of bins depending upon the age ",
    "metallicity of the input models .",
    "the analysis was also carried out using the _ observed _ index values as the inputs to the monte - carlo realisations ( rather than the best - fit model values ) .",
    "no significant quantitative or qualitative differences were found .",
    "[ error ] shows the results of this analysis as 1-sigma confidence contours for three age  metallicity bins .",
    "each contour in these plots is based on tens of thousands of individual realisations of the best - fit galaxy data .",
    "the contour levels were defined as the iso - densities corresponding to e@xmath12 of the peak values",
    "( as expected for the 1-sigma contour of a two - dimensional gaussian distribution ) .",
    "the use of the iso - density peak in estimating the extent of 1-sigma confidence contours results in a small uncertainty in the estimates .",
    "however , we estimate these to be of order 2% and therefore insignificant .    results of the error analysis for both passive galaxies ( in which balmer indices were included in fits ) and emission galaxies ( in which balmer indices were _ excluded _ from fits ) are shown separately .",
    "we recall that h@xmath29 was excluded from all the fits .",
    "[ error ] also shows the data divided into two signal - to - noise ratio regimes ( s / n@xmath2316  @xmath12 and",
    "s / n@xmath2516  @xmath12 ) . marginal distributions in log(age ) and [ z / h ] are shown at the edges of each main plot .",
    "we note that the positions of the contours in fig .",
    "[ error ] were chosen for clarity only . to get a full picture one must imagine the whole surface of the log(age)[z / h ] plane populated by such contours .",
    "[ error ] shows that , as might be expected , error estimates increase with decreasing signal - to - noise - ratio . for passive galaxies ,",
    "the analysis reveals log(age ) and [ z / h ] errors of @xmath00.1  dex in galaxies with s / n above @xmath016 .",
    "this falls to @xmath00.2  dex in galaxies with s / n below @xmath016 .",
    "the errors of the emission - galaxies ( in which all balmer lines are excluded from the fits ) are somewhat larger , but are generally still of order 0.2  dex .",
    "it is therefore clear that while the age ",
    "metallicity degeneracy is still present ( as evidenced by the sloped elliptical error contours in fig .",
    "[ error ] ) , the magnitude of the errors is sufficiently small for its effects to be negligible in our results - even in galaxies fit without balmer lines .",
    "this is the result , and main advantage , of using large numbers ( @xmath2510 ) indices in the determination of ages and metallicities .",
    "the good age resolution achieved is emphasised in the marginal distributions of fig .",
    "[ error ] , in which galaxies older than 10  gyr ( 1.0  dex ) , and galaxies younger than 1.5  gyr ( 0.15  dex ) ( delimited by dashed lines in the marginal distributions ) are largely uncontaminated by galaxies with ages of 3  gyr ( 0.5  dex ) .",
    "since the following analysis concentrates mainly on the very oldest and very youngest galaxies , these provide confidence that results do not suffer significantly from the effects of the age ",
    "metallicity degeneracy .    the final sample for which velocity dispersions and reliable age / metallicity estimates were measured consists of 4500 passive galaxies and 1000 emission galaxies .",
    "+          the combination of 6dfgs , 2mass and supercosmos data permits the comparison for spectroscopic age and metallicity determinations to the b , r and k band photometric data for some 6000 galaxies .",
    "specifically , by combining the photometry with the velocity dispersion measures from 6dfgs spectroscopy , we are able to investigate trends with age and metallicity in b , r and k band mass - to - light - ratios .    this analysis is carried out using a _",
    "dynamical _ mass ( m@xmath51 ) calculated as :    @xmath52    where @xmath32 is the central velocity dispersion , r@xmath53 is the half - light radius and the constant c has a value of 5.0 ( cappellari et al .",
    "unfortunately half - light radii are only available for 25% of our sample , while k band 20th magnitude isophotal radii ( r@xmath54 ) are available for the entire sample .",
    "a calibration was therefore carried out by using equation [ masseq ] to calculate masses for the galaxies in the 25% sub - sample ( which also possess much more accurate , aperture corrected , velocity dispersion estimates ) , and comparing them with mass estimates using r@xmath14 ( instead of r@xmath53 ) in the same equation . a plot of the comparison is shown in fig .",
    "[ mass_comp ] .",
    "the correlation has equation m@xmath55=1.068m@xmath561.223 with only 0.12  dex of scatter .",
    "given error estimates in m@xmath51 and m@xmath56 of 0.06 and 0.10  dex respectively , the correlation is clearly extremely good .",
    "masses quoted throughout the remainder of this work are therefore those based on r@xmath14 corrected as detailed .    as well as the photometry of 2mass and supercosmos , we also use the photometric results from the ssp models of bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) .",
    "some key values from the bruzual & charlot models are shown in table [ photometry ] .",
    "we use these models almost exclusively to estimate differential properties ; e.g. the rate of change of mass - to - light - ratio with log(age ) in populations of given [ z / h ] .",
    "it should be noted that the rates of change of the photometric properties are reasonably constant with metallicity and age , as long as age is expressed in logarithmic form .",
    "this clearly indicates that a differential approach is a robust use of the model values .",
    "we shall flag the one occasion in which the models are used in a non - differential manner .    .",
    "examples of b , r and k magnitudes from bc03 for single stellar population models of varying age and metallicity are presented .",
    "note that these values are used almost exclusively in a differential manner ( see section [ photo ] ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      we now turn our attention to the effects of the young central populations detected in our 6dfgs spectra on the global properties of galaxies as indicated by their photometry .",
    "there are 400 ` young ' ( @xmath231.5  gyr ) galaxies ( see section [ eamopp ] ) included in this analysis .",
    "plots of mass - to - light - ratio with mass for both young and old galaxies are shown in fig .",
    "mass - binned averages of young and old data are shown as blue and red solid lines respectively .",
    "also shown in these plots as dashed blue lines are model predictions of the effects of the differing ages and metallicities of the young and old populations in each mass bin .",
    "these are based on the comparison of luminosity values from the bc03 ssp models for the differences in age and metallicity of the young and old galaxies in each mass bin .",
    "a direct comparison of the data for young galaxies to these lines would therefore implicitly assume that the young central populations detected in the spectroscopy pervade the galaxies populations _ as a whole _ - i.e represents the same fraction of the galaxy population at all radii .",
    "young galaxies can be seen to be displaced with respect to the old galaxies in a sense consistent with their young ages .",
    "however , the displacements are small compared to the predicted values .",
    "they also become smaller towards higher masses .",
    "the data therefore show that , on average : ( i ) young populations do _ not _ pervade their host galaxies , but are instead centrally concentrated ; ii ) young populations must constitute relatively small fractions of total galaxy masses ; and ( iii ) the mass fraction in the form of a young stellar population must decrease with increasing galaxy mass .    to quantify these conclusions , for each mass bin , the fraction of total galaxy stellar mass and luminosity involved in the recent star - burst ( f@xmath57 and f@xmath58 ) were estimated .",
    "these estimates were made by a differential comparison of the bc03 predictions for mass - to - light - ratios to the observed values . in each waveband ,",
    "the difference between the observed mass - to - light - ratios of the young galaxies from those of the old galaxies in the same mass bin ( @xmath59log[m / l]@xmath60 ) was compared to the difference between model predictions for young and old populations of appropriate metallicity ( @xmath59log[m / l]@xmath61 ) . denoting these mass - to - light - ratio differences as s and r respectively ,",

    "the derivation of these expressions again assumes that the young populations at any given mass are seen against a background old population with a metallicity and mass - to - light - ratio appropriate to that mass ( as given by the mass - binned values for old galaxies in table [ mol ] ) .",
    "the young stellar population is nonetheless assumed to _",
    "dominate the central regions _",
    "( such that issues related to degeneracies with burst - strength do not arise ) .",
    "the estimates of mass- and luminosity - fractions and burst - masses are plotted against galaxy mass in fig .",
    "[ mass_frac ] . despite the ( expected ) variation in luminosity fractions between wavebands , agreement between the values for the mass fractions derived from the three wavebands is extremely good .",
    "this suggests that both our assumption of the same underlying dynamical ` tilt ' in young galaxies as exhibited by old galaxies is correct , and that our age and metallicity corrections are accurate .",
    "the trend shows a decreasing mass fraction with increasing mass falling from @xmath010% at 10@xmath67  m@xmath27 to 2% at 10@xmath68  m@xmath27 .",
    "this is in agreement with the study of treu et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , who find the stellar fraction formed in recent times varies from 20%-40% below 10@xmath69  m@xmath27 , to below 1% above 10@xmath68  m@xmath27 .",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "[ mass_frac ] are the estimates of average total mass involved in the recent burst of star formation .",
    "agreement between wavebands is again good .",
    "however , the absolute values given here must be treated with caution , as they are calculated by the only non - differential application of bc03 models used in this work .",
    "nevertheless , in a relative sense , the data exhibit a narrow range of burst - masses and an apparent _ upper limit _ on their size in high mass galaxies .      as a final consideration",
    "we next investigate the implications of our findings for colour - magnitude relations .",
    "note that these relations are independent of dynamical effects .    in fig .",

    "galaxies with both old ( grey points ) and young ( black points ) central populations are shown .",
    "averages ( binned by luminosity ) of the old and young populations are again shown as solid red and blue lines respectively .",
    "slopes in the old galaxies are in good accord with literature values ( thin black lines in each plot ) . as the sample includes late - type galaxies , particular amongst the young galaxies , these must lie close to the ` red sequence ' in our colour - magnitude diagrams .",
    "this suggests they therefore correspond to the ` dusty red - sequence ' of wolf , gray & meisenheimer ( 2005 ) .",
    "the lack of galaxies in the ` blue - cloud ' is almost certainly the result of a number of selection effects .",
    "these include the effects of template mismatches during velocity dispersion measurements and the removal of galaxies with poor fits or large errors during age / metallicity measurement .",
    "[ cmr ] shows that , for both colours , young galaxies tend to be bluer than the old galaxies .",
    "however , the offsets are extremely small . our results from the previous section indicate that this is largely the result of the low mass fractions formed in the recent star formation events .",
    "[ cmr ] therefore shows that galaxies lieing on , or close to , the red sequence may not be ` red and dead ' , but may still be forming modest numbers of new stars . indeed , we note that _ most _ of the galaxies with young central populations also exhibit on - going star formation ( fig .",
    "[ agez ] ) .",
    "we have measured ages and metallicities from the 6dfgs spectra of @xmath07000 galaxies of all morphological and emission types .",
    "we have demonstrated that the age ",
    "metallicity degeneracy has been broken in this study , particularly with regard to the very young and very old galaxies used in the subsequent analysis .",
    "these data for the _ central regions _ are compared with the _ global _ photometry from 2mass and supercosmos for the @xmath06000 galaxies for which such photometry is available . combining spectroscopy and photometry we are able to investigate trends in global b , r and k band mass - to - light - ratios with the central stellar populations of the galaxies .",
    "an age - metallicity trend is identified in passive galaxies that is consistent with the results of similar studies in the literature .",
    "the stellar populations of galaxies exhibiting emission lines ( arising from either star - bursts or agn ) follow a similar trend , but exhibit younger ages than their passive counterparts .    to minimise the effects of complex mixtures of stellar populations , we confine our analysis to the data for very old or very young galaxies .",
    "we find a steep mass - metallicity relation in old galaxies ( logarithmic slope of @xmath00.25 ) , while in young galaxies the trend is consistent with zero slope .",
    "using only the old galaxies , we find a dynamical trend in mass - to - light - ratios with mass of logarithmic slope @xmath00.15 .",
    "this is in good agreement with values reported in the literature .",
    "however , there is no agreement in the literature as to the cause of this tilt .",
    "padmanabhan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) concluded that most of the tilt is due to variations in dark matter content . from the modelling perspective ,",
    "robertson et al . (",
    "2006 ) perform simulations of a series of mergers and investigate the scaling relations of their merger remnants . from mergers of gas - rich disk galaxies",
    "they derive a fp with @xmath28 = 1.55 and @xmath29 = 0.82 , in good agreement with our k band values ( see table 3 ) . in their models",
    "the tilt away from the virial scaling relation is caused by gas dissipative effects and not dark matter content .",
    "trujillo et al . ( 2004 ) on the other hand attribute the tilt to ` non - homology ' , deriving almost identical contributions to the tilt from dynamical and stellar population effects as those we find in this work .",
    "our findings , however , also show that whatever the cause of the tilt , it is not a simple in mass - to - light - ratio ( or its scatter ) with mass or luminosity .",
    "instead we find a that a more complex description will be required ; this will be a subject of a future paper .",
    "considering extremely young galaxies , our results show that the properties of the central stellar populations identified by the spectroscopy do _ not _ generally correlate with the global properties of their host galaxies .",
    "indeed , the data indicate that recent bursts of star formation are limited to a mass of @xmath3310@xmath24  m@xmath27 and are strongly centrally concentrated .",
    "consequently , in high mass galaxies exhibiting young central populations , recent star forming events have negligible effect on their global photometry . as a consequence",
    "we have shown that galaxies sitting on , or near , the red sequence may not be ` red and dead ' , but may still be forming modest numbers of new stars .",
    "we therefore conclude that the young ages found in studies of galaxy centres in this and other spectroscopic studies should not be considered representative of the age of their host galaxies as a whole .",
    "they may , however , be reasonably interpreted as indicators of recent assembly events . as a result of these considerations ,",
    "the small scatter in photometric scaling relations , which initially motivated the monolithic collapse models , ceases to be inconsistent with either the hierarchical merging model or the results of the lick index studies indicating young central populations .    in future work",

    "<S> we present an analysis of the stellar populations as a function of mass in a sample of @xmath07000 galaxies of all morphological and emission types from the 6df galaxy survey ( 6dfgs ) . </S>",
    "<S> we measure velocity dispersions and lick indices from the spectra of the central regions of these galaxies , deriving ages and metallicities from the lick indices using stellar population models . </S>",
    "<S> we also derive dynamical masses and dynamical mass - to - light ratios for these galaxies by combining the central velocity dispersions with global photometry in the b , r and k bands from supercosmos and 2mass . </S>",
    "<S> together , these data allow us to reduce the degeneracies between age , metallicity and star formation burst - strength that have limited previous studies .    </S>",

    "<S> when we account for the effects of the mass - metallicity relation , we obtain a single , consistent relation between mass - to - light ratio and mass for old galaxies in all passbands , @xmath2 . as we have accounted for stellar population effects , this remaining variation in the mass - to - light with mass ( the residual ` tilt ' of the fundamental plane ) must have a dynamical origin . </S>",
    "<S> however , we demonstrate that any simple trend between mass - to - light - ratio and mass or luminosity is inconsistent with the observations , and that a more complex relationship must exist .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that the central regions of galaxies of all masses often exhibit young stellar populations . </S>",
    "<S> however it is only in the lowest - mass galaxies studied ( @xmath3 ) that these populations are evident in the global photometry . in higher - mass galaxies , young central populations </S>",
    "<S> have decreasing influence on the global photometry , with there being no discernible impact in galaxies more massive than @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the young stellar populations detected in spectroscopic studies are generally centrally concentrated , and that there is an upper limit on the mass of star - forming events in massive galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> these results have important ramifications for mass - to - light ratios estimated from photometric observations .    </S>",
