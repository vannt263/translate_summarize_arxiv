    "after free evolution during the focusing time @xmath120  ms , we take an absorption image of the cloud and extract the longitudinal density distribution , from which we deduce the initial momentum distribution .",
    "the focusing time @xmath103 is adjusted by minimising the width of the density distribution of cold samples .",

    "on the other hand , a better resolution may be necessary for a momentum distribution that is much narrower .",

    "nevertheless , larger focusing times can be obtained if a transverse potential is maintained during the focusing time , strong enough to overcome gravity ( which acts in the transverse plane in our experiment ) , but weak enough so that atomic interactions are negligible .",

    "after having performed the longitudinal focusing pulse and switched off the longitudinal potential , we ramp the transverse frequency down in @xmath119  ms , similar to the procedure described before .",

    "[ fig.results](b,2 ) shows that the theoretical momentum distribution decreases faster than @xmath35 at large momenta .",
    "this is mainly due to the contribution of the excited states , which have approximately gaussian momentum tails .",
    "however , with our snr of about 50 , no deviation from a @xmath35 behavior can be identified .",
    "we report in fig .",
    "[ fig.results](b,2 ) the fluctuations expected for the temperature @xmath161  nk ( obtained from the fit of the momentum distribution with qmc ) .",
    "they are in agreement with the measured fluctuations .",
    "note however that , for these parameters , the uncertainty of thermometry based on fluctuations is about 30% ( see gray lines in fig .",
    "[ fig.results](b,3 ) ) . the density profile expected for @xmath161",
    "nk is not far from the measured one ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.results](b,4 ) ) .",
    "in contrast to case ( a ) , yang - yang thermometry based on the profile is less sensitive to tiny modifications of the wings , since the profile of the high - density regions is also affected by the temperature .",
    "thus , a thermometry based on the profile is expected to be quite precise and the potential roughness is expected to have a smaller effect .",
    "a yang - yang fit to the experimental profile yields a temperature of @xmath162  nk , different only by 10% from the temperature deduced from the momentum distribution .",
    "we have shown that for @xmath52 , a simple 1d classical field approximation where the momentum distribution is computed without energy cutoff , fails to describe the momentum distribution of weakly interacting 1d bose gases in the crossover from ideal bose gas to quasi - condensate .",
    "thus , we performed qmc calculations to investigate the crossover .",
    "experimentally , we measure the momentum distribution with the focusing technique , which is improved by a guiding scheme for enhanced resolution . we show that the temperature deduced from the momentum distribution is in agreement with an independent fluctuation - based thermometry .",
    "we find that the result of bogoliubov theory is not appropriate for parameters that are close to the ones relevant to this article , even when the cloud lies quite deeply in the quasi - condensate regime . in  @xcite",
    ", it has been proposed to use the mean kinetic energy deduced from measured momentum distribution in order to extract the temperature using the modified yang - yang calculation . for the data presented in this article , with a snr of about 50 ,",
    "the measured momentum distribution shows tails compatible with a @xmath35 behavior both in the quasi - condensate regime and in the degenerate ideal bose gas regime .",
    "therefore , extraction of the mean kinetic energy from the data is impossible .",
    "we argue that this technique was applicable in  @xcite because of the more 3d nature of the gas : for quasi 1d gases , as discussed in section  [ sec.resultsb ] , the contribution of the transverse excited states leads to fast decaying tails , which enable the extraction of the mean kinetic energy per particle .",
    "we also remark that neither our measurements nor the qmc calculations display the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath0 , which only appears at even larger momenta for our parameters . on the other hand ,",
    "we believe that this behaviour could be more readily discernable in the strongly interacting regime , where the @xmath0 tail should contain a larger proportion of the atoms .",
    "this work opens many perspectives for the study of 1d gases .",
    "first of all , we show that momentum distribution measurements provide a precise thermometry for 1d bose gases .",
    "while in this article we use qmc calculations to fit the temperature of experimental data , a rough estimate of the cloud temperature could be performed with a lower numerical cost .",
    "indeed , the comparison with the exact qmc momentum distribution shows that a model which combines the ideal bose gas theory and the classical field approximation gives the correct width within 20% precision .",
    "second , momentum distribution measurements are essential to characterize more complex systems .",
    "for instance , in the presence of a lattice , it enables the investigation of the correlation properties at the mott and/or pinning transitions .",
    "contrary to bragg spectroscopy @xcite , where a single momentum component is probed at each shot , the focusing method as well as time of flight method gives access to the whole distribution at the same time , which allows for noise correlation measurements in momentum space  @xcite .",
    "finally , recording the time evolution of the momentum distribution is essential to monitor the non - equilibrium dynamics and address the issue of thermalization in 1d closed quantum systems .",
    "for example , the dynamics resulting from a quench of the 1d coupling constant can be investigated .",
    "the measure of the momentum distribution of impurities would also permit the study of impurity dynamics , which is currently under intense investigation  @xcite .",
    "the authors thank karen kheruntsyan for providing the data from the yang - yang calculations .",
    "this work was supported financially by the triangle de la physique , by the anr grant anr-09-nano-039 - 04 , the austro - french fwr - anr project i607 , the arc discovery project grant no .",

    "quantum fluctuations lead to an algebraic decay of @xmath20 as @xmath163 for distances @xmath164 , where @xmath165 is the healing length . for",
    "the decay to be noticeable over this range , one requires @xmath166 .        in terms of the analog quantum problem , @xmath167 , where the sum is carried out over the eigenstates of energy @xmath168 , and the factors @xmath169",
    "are obtained by wavefunction overlaps .",
