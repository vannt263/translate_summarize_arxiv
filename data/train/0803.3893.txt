    "transport properties of degenerate dense matter have been studied for a long time .",
    "they are especially important for simulating various processes in neutron stars , white dwarfs and degenerate cores of giant stars .",
    "all these objects contain a degenerate electron gas , and the electrons can give considerable contribution to transport coefficients .",
    "although the electron transport problem is very well elaborated and described in textbooks ( e.g. @xcite ) , some aspects have to be reconsidered .",
    "the first studies of electron transport properties ( thermal conductivity ) of degenerate stellar matter were performed by marshak @xcite , mestel @xcite and lee @xcite in the 1940s .",
    "further work in the next two decades is described by lampe @xcite who made considerable contribution into the calculation of the electron thermal conductivity .",
    "later the subject has been studied by many authors , particularly , by flowers and itoh @xcite and others @xcite . however , all these authors have considered collisions of relativistic charged particles in the static limit .",
    "the importance of dynamical interactions for relativistic particles was pointed out by heiselberg and pethick @xcite who analyzed transport properties of an ultrarelativistic quark plasma .",
    "the authors calculated transport coefficients of a degenerate ultrarelativistic plasma and showed that the results are qualitatively different from standard fermi - liquid expressions because ultrarelativistic charged particles interact mainly through their currents .",
    "such an interaction is produced via the exchange of transverse plasmons ( instead of the standard coulomb charge - charge interaction of non - relativistic particles via the exchange of longitudinal plasmons ) .",
    "an inclusion of transverse plasmons increases the effective collision rates ( decreases the kinetic coefficients ) .",
    "recently , we have reconsidered @xcite the electron thermal conductivity of degenerate matter containing an electron gas of any degree of relativity .",
    "we have shown , that a correct treatment of electron - electron collisions , including the exchange of transverse plasmons , increases the contribution of these collisions into the electron thermal conductivity .    in the present paper",
    "we perform similar revision of the electron shear viscosity .",
    "such a viscosity is important for studying hydrodynamical processes in neutron stars and white dwarfs , particularly the damping of oscillations of these objects .",
    "we will focus on the contribution from the electron - electron collisions .",
    "our analysis will be similar to that in refs .",
    "thus , we omit technical details .    the electron shear viscosity can be written as @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the electron number density ; @xmath3 and @xmath4 are , respectively , the electron fermi - momentum and fermi - velocity , @xmath5 being the electron effective mass on the fermi surface ( it differs from bare electron mass due to relativistic effects ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath6 is the total electron effective collision frequency , a sum of the electron - ion collision frequency @xmath7 and the electron - electron collision frequency @xmath8 .",
    "detailed calculations of @xmath7 have been recently performed in ref.@xcite , while @xmath8 is the main subject of our study . after calculating @xmath0",
    ", we briefly analyze the efficiency of @xmath9 in the cores of white dwarfs and envelopes of neutron stars ( particularly , for the damping of pulsations of pre - white dwarf and white dwarf stars ) .",
    "we consider an almost ideal and uniform strongly degenerate electron gas .",
    "the electrons can have any degree of relativity and collide among themselves and with plasma ions . to calculate the electron - electron collision frequency we use the standard variational approach with the simplest trial function @xcite .",
    "the variational expression for the effective electron - electron collision frequency , that determines the shear viscosity , is @xmath10 ^ 2 , \\label{general}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the temperature and @xmath12 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the integration is performed over all possible electron states involved into collisions @xmath13 ; @xmath14 is an electron momentum , @xmath15 being its component along the @xmath16 axis , @xmath17 is the electron velocity component along the @xmath18 axis ; primes indicate particle states after a collision ; @xmath19 is the fermi - dirac distribution function .",
    "equation ( [ general ] ) includes the symmetry factor @xmath20 which excludes double counting of the same collision events of identical particles ( electrons ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath21 is the differential transition probability , summed over spin states of colliding particles , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the electron energy .",
    "the delta - functions reflect momentum and energy conservation ; @xmath24 is the squared matrix element .",
    "the matrix element @xmath25 for a collision of charged particles depends on the character of plasma screening of electromagnetic interaction between these particles . for @xmath26 collisions ( of identical particles )",
    ", one has @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 correspond to two collision channels , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively , and @xmath32 in this case , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are momentum and energy transfers in a collision event , respectively ; @xmath35 is the transition 4-current , @xmath36 is the component of @xmath37 transverse to @xmath38 ; @xmath39 is a dirac matrix ; @xmath40 a normalized electron bispinor ( with @xmath41 ) , and @xmath42 is a dirac conjugate .",
    "the expression for @xmath29 is obtained from eq.([mfi ] ) by the interchange of indices @xmath43 ( which results also in changing @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) .    for",
    "collisions of strongly degenerate particles , calculations are simplified by placing all interacting particles on their fermi surfaces ( whenever possible ) .",
    "characteristic values of @xmath46 and @xmath47 in electron - electron collisions are determined by plasma screening , that is described by polarization functions @xmath48 and @xmath49 for the longitudinal ( charge - charge ) and transverse ( current - current ) interactions , respectively .",
    "the nature of plasma screening is discussed in refs .",
    "let us summarize the main points .",
    "usually , collisions of charged particles are studied in the so - called weak - screening approximation , in which momentum transfers are smaller than particle momenta .",
    "this approximation is justified by the long - range nature of electromagnetic interactions reflected in a specific @xmath46-dependence of the matrix element ( [ mfi ] ) ( a well pronounced peak at small @xmath46 ) . as a result",
    ", only small values of @xmath46 contribute to the integral ( [ general ] ) , being determined by the character of plasma screening @xcite . in the weak screening approximation , it is sufficient to consider the polarization functions in the classical limit ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) , in which they are given by @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 @xmath55 , and @xmath56 is the thomas - fermi electron screening wavenumber .",
    "the longitudinal and transverse screenings are essentially different .",
    "the most striking difference occurs in a strongly degenerate plasma at temperatures @xmath11 much below the electron plasma temperature @xmath57 ( that is determined by the electron plasma frequency @xmath58 ) . in this case",
    ", it is sufficient to consider the low - frequency limit of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , in which @xmath61 the longitudinal polarization function is real in this limit .",
    "it means , that longitudinal electromagnetic interaction ( via the exchange of longitudinal plasmons ) results in the standard debye - like screening with a characteristic momentum transfer @xmath62 [ see eq .  ( [ mfi ] ) ] . for the transverse interaction ( via the exchange of transverse plasmons ) ,",
    "characteristic momentum transfer is different , @xmath63 .",
    "moreover , the transverse polarization function is pure imaginary .",
    "accordingly , virtual transverse plasmons undergo collisionless absorption via the well - known landau damping .    comparing screening lengths in the low - energy limit",
    ", we see that @xmath64 .",
    "thus , transverse interactions occur on larger length - scales than longitudinal ones and are , therefore , more frequent . in the previous works on the electron shear viscosity ,",
    "this difference between longitudinal and transverse interactions have been neglected and one set @xmath65 .",
    "it is a good approximation in the non - relativistic case , because the ratio of transverse to longitudinal parts of the matrix element in eq.([mfi ] ) contains a relativistic factor @xmath66 .",
    "hence , transverse interactions of non - relativistic particles are inefficient . in contrast , the collisions of relativistic electrons via the exchange of transverse plasmons are more important than the collisions via the exchange of longitudinal plasmons ( owing to larger screening length ) .",
    "this effect was analyzed by heiselberg and pethick @xcite for a gas of ultrarelativistic quarks . here",
    ", we consider the electron - electron collisions for any degree of electron relativity , in analogy with the study of ref.@xcite for the thermal conductivity .",
    "placing all colliding particles on their fermi surfaces and performing possible analytical integrations with the aid of delta - functions , we finally obtain the following expressions for the electron - electron collision frequency and associated partial shear viscosity , @xmath67 here , @xmath68 is the fine structure constant , and @xmath69 is a dimensionless function of two variables , @xmath70 @xmath71 is the angle between components of momenta @xmath72 and @xmath73 transverse to @xmath74 , and @xmath75 .",
    "note , that in the small - momentum approximation , the interference term between @xmath76 and @xmath77 is small and both collision channels give equal contributions , resulting in @xmath78 .",
    "equations ( [ result ] ) and ( [ i ] ) generalize eqs .  ( 47 ) and ( 48 ) from ref .",
    "@xcite to the case of arbitrary degree of relativity .",
    "integration over @xmath71 in eq .",
    "( [ i ] ) is straightforward and gives @xmath79 where @xmath80 comes from the exchange of longitudinal plasmons , @xmath81 from the exchange of transverse plasmons , and @xmath82 is the interference term .    following ref .",
    "@xcite , consider four regimes of collisions between degenerate electrons as indicated in table [ tab : regimes ] .",
    ".four regimes of shear viscosity @xmath0 of degenerate electrons . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the regime i occurs in a non - relativistic ( @xmath83 ) and rather warm ( although degenerate ) plasma ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "the analysis of ( [ i ] ) leads to the following asymptotic expressions valid in this regime : @xmath85 the leading contribution comes from @xmath80 owing to a small relativistic factor @xmath86 ( as discussed above ) .",
    "the logarithmic terms and constant corrections in brackets are corresponding coulomb logarithms ( the corrections were calculated numerically ) .",
    "the leading - term result for @xmath0 in this regime is well - known .    in the regime iii , where the plasma is again warm ( @xmath87 ) , but",
    "the electron gas is ultrarelativistic ( @xmath88 ) , @xmath80 is the same as in the regime i ( because @xmath80 is independent of @xmath86 ) .",
    "the asymptotic expressions for two other integrals have the same form as in the regime i but with different corrections , @xmath89 now all three terms give comparable contribution to @xmath90 .",
    "the asymptote for @xmath90 in the ultrarelativistic case coincides with that obtained by heiselberg and pethick @xcite .",
    "it is different from the asymptote obtained by using an incorrect longitudinal screening in the transverse part of @xmath25 .",
    "however , the difference occurs only in the corrections to the dominant logarithmic terms .",
    "the regimes ii and iv are realized in a cold plasma ( @xmath91 ) . in this case , we get @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the riemann zeta function and @xmath94 is the gamma function . in the ultrarelativistic limit ( the regime iv , @xmath95 ) , these expressions coincide with those obtained by heiselberg and pethick for an ultrarelativistic quark plasma @xcite .",
    "the main contribution to @xmath90 in the regime ii comes from @xmath80 due to a strong suppression of @xmath82 and @xmath96 in the non - relativistic case . in the regime iv , which operates usually everywhere in the neutron star crust ( excluding only a thin layer",
    " a few meters  from the surface ) and in the neutron star core , the situation is different .",
    "the leading term is then @xmath81 , which corresponds to the exchange of transverse plasmons .",
    "it dominates because of smaller characteristic momentum transfers ( larger electron mean - free paths ) than those owing to the exchange of longitudinal plasmons .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath0 in the regime iv differs from the standard fermi - liquid case ( now @xmath97 instead of the standard dependence @xmath98 ) .",
    "the difference is smaller , than for the thermal conductivity @xmath99 ( @xmath99 is remarkably independent of @xmath11 in the regime iv while a standard fermi - liquid requires @xmath100 ) .",
    "therefore , the landau damping affects the shear viscosity weaker than the thermal conductivity .",
    "in addition to the above asymptotes , we have calculated @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 on a dense grid of @xmath86 and @xmath101 values covering transition regions between the regimes i  iv .",
    "we have further obtained the fit expressions which reproduce numerical results and asymptotic limits . the fit for @xmath80",
    "is @xmath102 with the maximum fit error of @xmath103 at @xmath104 ( let us recall , that @xmath80 is independent of @xmath86 ) .",

    "the boundary of the degenerate core shifts now to lower densities ( to @xmath172 g  @xmath127 ) ; the contribution of the electron - electron collisions via the exchange of transverse plasmons is lower .",
    "finally , the right panel of figure [ f : gdpg ] shows the shear viscosity for the conditions in the core of the pulsating dav white dwarf r  548 .",
    "the observational data imply @xmath173 12  000 k , and , again , the white dwarf mass @xmath160 .",
    "the theory @xcite predicts a nearly isothermal degenerate core with the temperature @xmath174 k. we have calculated the shear viscosity assuming the c - o core with equal mass fractions of c and o. the shear viscosity @xmath125 , limited by electron - ion collisions in a c - o mixture , has been determined using the linear mixing rule @xcite .",
    "the contribution of collisions via the exchange of transverse plasmons is now noticeable only at @xmath175  g  @xmath127 .    our three examples in figure [ f : gdpg ]",
    "cover a representative range of pulsating pre - white dwarf and white dwarf models .",
    "in all the cases the kinematic electron shear viscosity @xmath157 is of the same order of magnitude , with characteristic values of @xmath176 @xmath177  s@xmath178 .",
    "if the damping of g - modes were solely determined by shear viscosity in the stellar core , a typical damping time could have been estimated as @xmath179 , where @xmath180 is a length scale of pulsation modes .",
    "characteristic length scales are @xmath181 , where @xmath182 10  000 km is the white dwarf radius and @xmath183 is the number of radial oscillation nodes .",
    "this gives @xmath184 yr , indicating that the shear viscosity in the cores of pulsating white dwarfs is rather inefficient in damping observed pulsations .",
    "it would be equally inefficient to damp other possible large - scale hydrodynamic motions in white dwarf cores ( for instance , differential rotation ) .",
    "the shear viscosity in white dwarf cores should have much stronger effect on small - scale motions .",
    "for instance , these could be small - scale ( high-@xmath183 or high-@xmath185 ) pulsations , or ordinary pulsations in stratified cores , containing sharp boundaries between different layers ( e.g. , separating phases of different elements or phases of solidified and liquid matter ) .",
    "viscous dissipation in boundary layers can be strong .",
    "similar conclusions can be made on the efficiency of the electron shear viscosity in the envelope ( crust ) of neutron stars ( where one typically has @xmath186 0.01100",
    "@xmath177 s@xmath178 for the range of the internal crust temperature from @xmath187  k to @xmath188  k @xcite ) .",
    "the viscosity @xmath9 there is not too high and can not be a strong regulator of large - scale motions ( pulsations ) .",
    "nevertheless , characteristic length scales in neutron stars are naturally much shorter than in white dwarfs ( because neutron stars are smaller , and their crust thickness is @xmath1891 km ) .",
    "this increases the efficiency of the shear viscosity ( decreases viscous damping times ) in neutron star envelopes ( as compared to white dwarf cores ) .",
    "moreover , a neutron star crust has a well defined heterogeneous ( multi - layer ) structure @xcite , where viscous boundary layers can occur and viscous dissipation can be strong . such effects are currently almost unexplored .",
    "we have calculated the partial electron shear viscosity @xmath0 owing to collisions between degenerate electrons in a dense degenerate plasma taking into account the landau damping of transverse plasmons .",
    "our main conclusions are :    1 .",
    "the landau damping reduces @xmath0 for all temperature and density regions i  iv ( table [ tab : regimes ] ) .",
    "2 .   the strongest reduction occurs in the region iv of cold ( @xmath190 ) relativistic ( @xmath191  g  @xmath127 ) electron plasma . in this region ,",
    "the landau damping lowers the viscosity @xmath0 by several orders of magnitude and modifies its temperature dependence ( which becomes @xmath192 instead of the traditional dependence @xmath193 ) .",
    "3 .   the viscosity @xmath0 gives a noticeable contribution to the total electron viscosity @xmath9 in a plasma of light ions at @xmath194 .",
    "4 .   the viscosity @xmath0 can also give a significant contribution to @xmath9 in a deep crust ( @xmath195 g  @xmath127 ) of a cold neutron star ( @xmath196 ) provided crystalline lattice of atomic nuclei is rather pure and the freezing of _ umklapp _ processes at low @xmath11 is sufficiently strong .",
    "both factors , the impurity of crystals and the character of _ umklapp _ freezing , are currently uncertain and require special study .",
    "we have approximated our results by simple analytic expressions which are valid in the wide range of densities and temperatures appropriate to degenerate cores of white dwarfs and red giants and to the envelopes of neutron stars .",
    "the analytic approximations can be easily incorporated into computer codes to simulate hydrodynamical processes in these stars .",
    "we have briefly analyzed ( section [ white dwarfs ] ) the efficiency of viscous damping in the cores of white dwarfs and envelopes of neutron stars .",
    "the contribution of collisions of degenerate electrons via the landau damping during the exchange of transverse plasmons has been neglected in all previous considerations of the electron shear viscosity . in the context of transport properties of dense quark plasma",
    "it was studied by heiselberg and pethick @xcite .",
    "we have recently reconsidered the effect of the landau damping on the electron thermal conductivity in neutron star crust and core @xcite . the same effect on the shear viscosity in the neutron star core ( taking into account possible superfluidity of nucleons ) will be studied in a similar way and published elsewhere .",
