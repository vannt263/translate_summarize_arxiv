    "the importance of lasers typically reflects two aspects : their practical use in a wide range of applications and their highly controllable nonlinear coherent optical response.@xcite in addressing the first aspect there is a systematic effort to reduce the required injection for the onset of lasing . in semiconductor lasers ,",
    "this can be realized by fabricating structures of reduced dimensionality , such as quantum wells , wires , and dots,@xcite or by considering physical mechanisms that enhance stimulated emission , such as polaritons or introduction of spin - polarized carriers.@xcite in the second aspect , lasers also present valuable model systems to elucidate connections to other cooperative phenomena.@xcite as the injection or pumping of the lasers is increased , there is a transition from incoherent to coherent emitted light that can be described by the landau theory of second - order phase transitions.@xcite moreover , the instabilities found in lasers directly resemble instabilities found in electronic devices.@xcite since some lasers provide highly accurate and tunable parameters , further insights can be achieved by establishing mapping procedures between such lasers and other cooperative phenomena , such as ferromagnetism .",
    "@xcite    in this work we explore similarities between the quantum wells ( qws ) and quantum dots ( qds ) used as the gain material in semiconductor lasers .",
    "on one hand , qw lasers have a very transparent description , readily available at the textbook level.@xcite on the other hand , while qd - based active regions require a more complicated description , they also lead to desirable operation properties , such as low threshold for lasing , robust temperature performance , low chirp , and narrow gain spectra.@xcite therefore a mapping between qd- and qw - based lasers has the potential to yield a simple description ( as used in qw lasers ) to investigate a more complex and yet technologically interesting systems ( involving qds ) .    to establish such a mapping we focus on two cases : ( i ) conventional ( spin - unpolarized ) lasers , and ( ii ) spin lasers in which the spin - polarized carriers are injected by circularly polarized light or by electrical injection ( using a magnetic contact ) .",
    "spin lasers can be described as a generalization of conventional lasers : with spin - unpolarized injection , spin lasers must reduce to conventional lasers.@xcite a further motivation to consider spin lasers in the current context is provided by the recent experiments showing significant improvements in qd - lasers@xcite ( including 100 k higher operation than in their electrically injected qw - based counterparts@xcite ) , which were analyzed as if they were qw lasers .",
    "a schematic description of the qw and qd semiconductor laser is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:01 ] , representing the conduction band ( cb ) diagram and several characteristic processes included in our rate equation ( re ) approach.@xcite with the usually employed assumption of charge neutrality , the underlying picture is simplified since holes need not be explicitly considered for conventional lasers.@xcite the injection of spin - polarized carriers leads to circular polarization of the emitted light .",
    "depicted carrier recombination ( in both qws and qds ) is either spontaneous or stimulated , and a sufficiently high injection leads to the onset of lasing when the optical gain can overcome losses in the resonant cavity .",
    "a more complex description of qd lasers includes several additional processes and a two - dimensional qw - like wetting layer ( wl ) , which acts as a reservoir of carriers . carriers from the wl are captured to the qd or , conversely , they can escape from qd to wl . to correctly describe the small density of qd states , as well as saturation of the wl states at high injection , it is important to include the pauli blocking which impedes carrier transfer to states close to saturation .",
    "the pauli blocking is responsible for additional nonlinear contributions to the qd res and for a dark current ( i.e. , a current that is not accompanied by any emission of light ) , both of which are absent in our simpler description of qw lasers .    to provide an intuitive picture of changes arising from the spin - polarized injection ,",
    "we develop here a bucket model of spin lasers , compared in fig .",
    "[ fig:02 ] with the well - known model for conventional lasers.@xcite a simple analogy with the pumped bucket illustrates _ on _ and _ off _ regimes in conventional lasers , where the outgoing water represents the emitted light . at low injection or pumping @xmath0",
    ", there is only negligible output light .",
    "the operation of a laser is similar to that of a light emitting diode ( led ) ; the spontaneous recombination is responsible for the emitted light . at higher injection , when the water starts to gush out of the large slit in fig .",
    "[ fig:02a ] , the lasing threshold is reached . at the threshold injection @xmath1 ,",
    "stimulated emission starts and the emitted light intensity increases significantly .",
    "@xmath2 corresponds to lasing operation in which the stimulated recombination is the dominant mechanism of light emission .",
    "we next turn to the pictorial representation of a simple spin laser . to model different projections of carrier spin or helicities of light , it is convenient to think of an analogy with hot and cold water , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:02b ] .",
    "the bucket is partitioned into two halves , representing two spin populations , which are separately filled with hot and cold water , respectively .",
    "the openings in the partition allow mixing of hot and cold water , intended to model the spin relaxation.@xcite with an unequal injection of hot and cold water , injection spin polarization is defined as@xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 are the injections of the two spin projections which together comprise the total injection @xmath5 .",
    "the difference in the hot and cold water levels @xmath6 [ see fig .  [ fig:02b ] ] , leads to the three operating regimes and two different lasing thresholds @xmath7.@xcite    at low pumping ( when both hot and cold water levels are below the large slit ) , both spin - up and spin - down carriers are in the _ off _ ( led ) regime , thus with negligible emission . at higher pumping",
    ", the hot water reaches the large slit and it gushes out as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:02b ] , while the amount of cold water coming out is still negligible .",
    "such a scenario represents a regime in which the majority spin is lasing , while the minority spin is still in the led regime ; thus the stimulated emission is from recombination of majority spin carriers .",
    "two important consequences of this regime are already confirmed experimentally : ( i ) a spin laser will start to lase at a smaller total injection than a corresponding conventional laser ( only a part of the bucket needs to be filled ) .",
    "this represents the threshold reduction in spin lasers , which can be parametrized as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the majority spin threshold ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "( ii ) even a modest injection polarization @xmath11 can lead to highly circularly polarized light.@xcite the relative width of this `` spin - filtering regime '' can be expressed as the interval@xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the minority spin threshold ( @xmath14 ) and the width of this interval increases with the injection spin polarization .",
    "@xmath15 gives rise to minority helicity photons from minority spin carriers , and the spin polarization of light converges to @xmath16 with increasing injection,@xcite analogous to the situation where both hot and cold water gush out .",
    "based on the intuitive pictures that we describe here , we present the rate equations for qd and qw lasers in the following section .",

    "since the mapping is not limited to conventional lasers , it can also be used to guide further developments of qd spin lasers .",
    "the presence of qds in the active region leads to reduced influence of the spin - orbit coupling,@xcite resulting in a longer spin relaxation time which improves lasing properties , giving a lower threshold and enhanced bandwidth .",
