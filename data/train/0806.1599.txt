    "in the last decade , double layer strontium manganites  have attracted the interest of the colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) community due to a magnetoresistive effect even larger than in the pseudocubic compounds , and for their peculiar anisotropic magneto - transport properties .",
    "these systems are the @xmath13 members of the ruddlesden - popper ( r - p ) series @xmath14sr@xmath15mn@xmath16o@xmath17 , constituted by blocks of two adjacent magnetic mno@xmath18 planes , decoupled from each other by a rocksalt - like block of non - magnetic oxide ( la , sr)o . at optimum doping ( @xmath19 )",
    ", the material is a quasi 2-dimensional ferromagnetic metal ( fmm ) with a reported curie temperature @xmath20  k @xcite and a highly anisotropic electrical conductivity @xmath21 ( two orders of magnitude larger in the @xmath22 plane than along the @xmath23 axis ) .",
    "@xcite in some sense , these compounds may be viewed as a natural kind of fmm - oxide multilayers , and hence prototype systems for the study of the physics of spin - polarized electrons in heterostructures , which is the clue for the production of spintronic devices .    as for their pseudo - cubic counterparts , the electronic and magnetic states of these materials",
    "result from the competition of different interactions , comparable in energy scale .",
    "while zener s double exchange ( de ) dominates in the fmm state ( @xmath24 ) , electronic correlations drive the system through a number of different insulating phases with distinct types of magnetic , charge , and orbital order as a function of temperature and hole doping @xmath25 , leading to a very complex phase diagram .",
    "@xcite because of the reduced dimensionality , however , the de term is less effective in the double - layered compounds , as indicated by their strongly diminished curie temperatures ( @xmath26  k and 370  k in  and , respectively , around optimal doping @xmath27 ) .",
    "further de energy reduction may arise from cation size mismatch when different alkali - earth metals and rare earths are substituted .",
    "the small ionic radius of pr@xmath28 induces distortions and tilting of the mno@xmath29 octahedra , which depress the hopping term both by directly reducing the overlap of the mn an o orbitals , and by altering the relative populations of the @xmath30 orbitals .",
    "@xcite as a result , the fmm phase may become unstable , and the systems exhibit metal - insulator ( mi ) transitions .",
    "the isoelectronic series  shows indeed an insulating non - ferromagnetic ground state for @xmath31 .",
    "nevertheless , the fmm phase still exists at these compositions as a metastable one , into which the system can be driven by applying a magnetic field of order a few tesla at low temperature , or by cooling the sample in an even smaller applied field .",
    "@xcite the former process is actually a field - induced first order mi transition , and the corresponding drop in electrical resistivity may be viewed as another kind of cmr .",
    "the system displays peculiar thermal and magnetic hysteresis effects , and the fmm state survives even after removal of the magnetic field .",
    "@xcite    while the mi transition has been subject of vast investigation and is well understood , @xcite magnetism in the non - fmm phases of this series has been debated for long time",
    ". no spontaneous magnetic order has ever been demonstrated at @xmath31 in the so - called virgin state ( zero field , zero field cooled ) at low temperature , and hence the systems have been assigned to a spin - glass state .",
    "@xcite moreover , the nature of the paramagnetic phase itself in double - layer manganites is the subject of a controversy reaching well beyond the issue of la - pr substitution .",
    "these systems exhibit in fact enhanced magnetic susceptibility well above the highest known @xmath12 of a double - layer manganite , up to close to room temperature . at the same temperatures",
    ", arpes recently showed evidence in la@xmath32sr@xmath33mn@xmath34o@xmath35 for a locally metallic phase in a globally insulating state .",
    "@xcite although the possible presence of spurious fmm inclusions in the sample has been considered in many papers , there is however general disagreement about their role in the anomalous responses detected in the paramagnetic phase . according to some authors ,",
    "such responses are essentially intrinsic spin and electronic properties of the double - layer material , @xcite while they are mostly due to the intergrowth of a secondary fmm phase for some other .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we address the issue of the magnetic state of la - pr double - layer manganites by means of local probes of magnetism , namely , muon spin rotation ( @xmath1sr ) and @xmath2mn nmr .",
    "implanted muons are sensitive probes of local magnetic fields in the matter , suited to investigate the magnetic structure even in the case of short - range order or dilute magnetic clusters , where probes in the reciprocal space can not detect any magnetic bragg peak .",
    "in addition , @xmath2mn nmr in zero external field provides a determination of the spontaneous hyperfine fields at @xmath2mn nuclei , which constitutes a probe of both magnetic order and the electronic state of the mn ions .",
    "the investigation is complemented by magnetization and magnetic susceptibility measurements . by combining these techniques ,",
    "we demonstrate that the @xmath31 compositions display short range antiferromagnetic order below a nel temperature @xmath36  k , while any ferromagnetic response above that temperature is to be assigned to pseudocubic fmm inclusions , of order 1% of sample volume .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : experimental ] provides a brief description of sample preparation and the experimental methods , as well as the essential guidelines to the nmr technique applied to the study of manganites . in section [ ssec : results.musr ]",
    "we describe the @xmath1sr results on the changes in magnetic structure across the phase diagram . in section [ ssec : results.magn ] we present evidence for ferromagnetic intergrowths from magnetometry and susceptometry .",
    "the electronic nature of the intergrowths and their peculiar coupling to the bilayer manganite domains are further elucidated by @xmath2mn nmr in section [ ssec : results.nmr ] .",
    "results are discussed in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the single crystals were grown with the floating - zone method by using an image furnace , melting sintered rods of polycrystalline materials of the same nominal compositions obtained by standard solid - state reaction . for @xmath2mn nmr on unsubstituted  at low - temperature , however , we employed the original powder material instead of the final single crystal due to the small penetration depth of radiofrequency ( rf ) in a metal , making a bulk conductive sample opaque to the driving rf field .",
    "a subset of these crystals have been subject to the investigations reported in refs .  .",
    "preliminary magnetic characterization by macroscopic dc magnetization measurements in a field of 10  mt confirmed ferromagnetic order at compositions @xmath37 with curie temperatures decreasing from @xmath38k in the pr - free compound , down to @xmath39k at @xmath40 , and a non - fm state at @xmath41 .",
    "@xcite      measurements were carried out by means of a quantum design mpms - xl squid device , employed either as a dc magnetometer or as an ac susceptometer in zero bias field .",
    "magnetic ac susceptibility was also measured vs.  temperature in the rf domain from the increase in inductance of a small coil ( @xmath42 nh in air ) wound around the sample and placed in a liquid nitrogen cryostat .",
    "the coil was driven by a rf field of @xmath43  oe at a frequency of @xmath44 mhz by a hewlett - packard 4191a impedance meter , to which it was connected by a @xmath45 coaxial cable for the working frequency .",
    "the inductance @xmath46 is related to the rf volume magnetic susceptibility @xmath47 by @xmath48 where n and f are the demagnetization and filling factors of the sample , respectively . in the case of a bulk conductive sample , a significant diamagnetic contribution to @xmath47 may also arise from eddy currents .",
    "this rf method is therefore intended as a qualitative characterization , only sensitive to large fm components .",
    "nuclear magnetic resonance experiments were performed by means of a home - built phase - coherent spectrometer , @xcite using an oxford exa field - swept cold - bore cryomagnet as a sample environment .",
    "spectra were recorded point by point at frequency steps of 1 mhz by a standard @xmath49 spin echo sequence , with delays @xmath50 of 3 - 5 @xmath51 , and equal rf pulses @xmath52 of 0.5 - 2 @xmath51 with intensity optimized for maximum signal .",
    "nmr signals from antiferromagnetic ( af ) phases , characterized by a small rf enhancement factors ( see below ) , were detected by a tuned probehead , while the strongly enhanced signals from ferromagnetic ( fm ) phases could be detected by a non - resonant circuit ( a small coil terminated onto 50  @xmath53 ) with a fully automated procedure .",
    "the @xmath2mn nuclear probe is coupled to the electronic mn moments by the hyperfine interaction , of the form @xmath54 giving rise to a spontaneous magnetic field @xmath55 at the nuclei in the magnetically ordered state of the material . here",

    "@xcite in the case of manganites , @xmath62 would give rise to resonance frequencies of approx .",
    "300 and 400 mhz for mn@xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) and mn@xmath28 ( @xmath65 ) , respectively .",
    "the hyperfine field of mn@xmath28 , however , also exhibits a sizable pseudo - dipolar component @xmath66 of order 100 koe , while the anisotropic coupling tensor @xmath67 vanishes for the octahedral symmetric mn@xmath63 ion . as a consequence of this anisotropic coupling term the resonance frequency of @xmath2mn in mn@xmath28",
    "may lie anywhere in the 250 - 500 mhz frequency range , depending of the orientation of the electronic spin relative to the ionic symmetry axis .",
    "@xcite in the presence of many magnetically nonequivalent sites , the resonance of @xmath2mn in mn@xmath28 may be split into a number of satellite lines , as it was actually found in insulating low - doped .",
    "@xcite at increased structural or magnetic disorder , @xmath67 of mn@xmath28 may simply contribute to a huge inhomogeneous linewidth , while the resonance of @xmath2mn in mn@xmath63 are comparatively much sharper . in the metallic state of pseudo - cubic , however , individual 3 + and 4 + ions are replaced by a single mn mixed valence of @xmath68 , while the pseudo - dipolar coupling term is averaged out by fast electronic motion . as a consequence , the broad and complex nmr spectrum typical of the insulating compositions collapses into a single motionally - narrowed line in the metallic state .",
    "information about the type of magnetic order , ferro- or antiferromagnetic , can be obtained by nmr from the so - called radiofrequency enhancement , consisting in an amplification of the effective rf field at the nucleus , due to the hyperfine coupling between nuclear and electronic spins .",
    "an applied rf field couples to the magnetization of a magnetic material and tilts its electronic moments , thus inducing a modulation of the hyperfine field at the nucleus at the same frequency .",
    "@xcite since the hyperfine field is of order several tesla , a small rf perturbation usually gives rise to a large modulation of @xmath69 at the same frequency .",
    "hence , if @xmath70 is the rf field applied in the sample coil , the effective rf field driving the resonance at the nucleus is enhanced by a factor @xmath71 , @xmath72 . as compared to nmr of the same nucleus in a non - magnetic materials , nuclear resonance",
    "can therefore be excited by reduced rf power .",
    "the same amplification mechanism holds for the nmr signal induced in the pick up coil : @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the signal amplitude , and @xmath75 is the number of resonating nuclei .",
    "the rf enhancement depends on the local magnetic structure and on the effective magnetic anisotropy . clearly , @xmath76 is larger in ferromagnets because of their larger net magnetization coupling to the external rf field .",
    "two enhancement mechanisms may be distinguished in a ferromagnet : the applied rf field may displace the domain walls , or it may rotate the magnetization in the bulk of domains . the former comes into play for nuclei within domain walls and is generally the dominant mechanism in zero field , where it may give rise to values @xmath77 , while it vanishes in an applied static field above the saturation value .",
    "the latter is usually less effective by one - two orders of magnitude , and it is present both in zero and in an applied field . in special cases ( e.g.  uniaxial anisotropy and @xmath70 perpendicular to the easy axis ) ,",
    "straightforward calculation yields a domain enhancement factor @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the anisotropy field , while such a relation may only be taken as a qualitative one for the domain - wall enhancement @xmath80 , whose actual dependence is much more complicated .",
    "the experiments were performed at paul scherrer institut ( villigen , ch ) on the gps spectrometer in the spin - rotator ( sr ) setup .",
    "the asymmetry of the muon decay , @xmath81 , is directly proportional to the time dependent muon spin projection along the axis joining a detector pair at the opposite sides of the sample , which reveals the spin precession around the local field . @xcite with the sr the initial muon polarization is rotated from the beam direction ( @xmath82 axis ) by @xmath83 towards the vertical axis ( @xmath84 ) , while emitted positrons were detected by two detector pairs along @xmath82 and @xmath84 .",
    "the crystals were mounted with the @xmath23 axis parallel either to @xmath82 or @xmath84 , as more appropriate .",
    "this allowed simultaneous detection of the muon spin projections parallel and perpendicular to @xmath23 .    in transition",
    "metal oxides muons stop at few ( typically one or two ) distinct interstitial sites .",
    "the muon spin is coupled to the electronic mn moments by dipolar and hyperfine interactions , providing a different local magnetic field @xmath85 at each distinct site .",
    "depending on its orientation each local field gives rise to precessing and to longitudinal components of the muon spin , revealed respectively by damped oscillations and purely relaxing terms in the muon asymmetry .",

    "since precessing components are distinguished by their frequencies , whereas longitudinal components are not , only a cumulative term may be determined experimentally for the latter .",
    "we report separately the results obtained by the different techniques , starting from @xmath1sr , then magnetometry and finally nmr .",

    "the double layer manganite is exchange coupled to the intergrowths , which are known to occur as stacking faults , extended in the ( 001 ) planes and very short in the c direction .",

    "nmr demonstrates that these intergrowths display a ferromagnetic metallic state very close to that of the pseudocubic bulk material .",
    "in addition , nmr and susceptibility data reveal a peculiar increase of their magnetic anisotropy in coincidence with the magnetic ordering of the proper double layer manganite phase , more evident at af compositions thanks to the magnetic contrast between the inclusions and the host matrix .",
    "such a magnetic hardening constitutes the proof of a strong exchange coupling between the two phases , which points to a large surface to volume ratio of the impurity domains .",

    "we notice that they may indicate that the  matrix is not passive , in the presence of magnetized inclusions and that the two intermixed phases give rise to specific , coupled , peculiar magnetic properties .    in conclusion",
