    "progress has been made in further determining the low lying spectrum of n=1 su(2 ) susy yang - mills theory ( sym ) .",
    "the motivation for doing large scale simulations has been presented at previous conferences and in various publications , for a review on the subject see @xcite .",
    "this work is related to a previous project of the desy - mnster - roma collaboration to simulate sym in the vicinity of the supersymmetric point @xcite using the dynamical - fermion two step multibosonic algorithm ( tsmb ) .",
    "this involves a light gluino mass .",
    "previous calculations left open the questions a ) how close to the susy limit was the model actually simulated and b ) the multiplet structure of the spectrum .",
    "the first question was answered by last year s susy ward - identity results @xcite showing that the gluino was heavier than expected from previous estimates .",
    "the second question is still under investigation and up to now not conclusively answered .",
    "here we attempt an analysis of the spectrum closer to the susy limit , i.e. with a lighter gluino , where the susy pattern of masses should become more apparent .",
    "a basic assumption about the non - perturbative behavior of n=1 sym is confinement , as in qcd . following results from effective action analyses @xcite , we expect to see two chiral multiplets at the bottom of the sym mass spectrum .",
    "their content is a spin-@xmath3 fermion ( the gluino - glueball ) and two bosonic states with opposite parity : a scalar and pseudoscalar gluino - gluino bound state ( gluinoball ) @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( _ a _ denoting the adjoint representation of the gluinos ) and the scalar and pseudoscalar glueball with @xmath6 and @xmath7 .    on the lattice ,",
    "poincar invariance is broken and therefore susy .",
    "we use wilson fermions where susy is also explicitely broken by the lack of chiral symmetry .",
    "finally a soft breaking is caused by the gluino mass .",
    "because of all this susy breaking the sym spectrum gets distorted on the lattice in an essentially uncontrolled way .",
    "we compute the sym mass spectrum on the lattice from first principles using the familiar techniques known in qcd .",
    "the correlation functions of the gluinoballs are similar to those of qcd flavor singlets @xmath8 { \\rm tr_{sc}}[\\gamma \\delta_{yy } ]      \\right.\\nonumber \\\\ \\left .        \\quad",
    "\\quad -2{\\rm tr_{sc } } [ \\gamma \\delta_{xy}\\gamma\\delta_{yx } ]      \\right>.   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is a fixed source , the trace is over spin and color and @xmath10 .    the gluino - glueball is associated in the continuum with the interpolating operator @xmath11 $ ] where @xmath12 is the gluino field ; on the lattice the correlation is @xmath13 \\delta_{xa;yb}^{\\alpha'\\beta ' } \\nonumber \\\\ \\times { \\rm tr_c}[u_{kl}(y ) \\sigma^{b}]\\sigma_{kl}^{\\beta'\\beta}.\\quad \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the trace here is only over color .",
    "the glueball operators are the equivalents to those of qcd .    in order to be able to make meaningful statements of the ermergence of susy in the continuum through extrapolations , we want the gluino to be as light as possible . as in qcd ,",
    "the natural barrier is algorithmic performance due to critical slowing down .",
    "following curci and veneziano , we employ @xmath14 = \\beta \\sum_p \\left ( 1- { \\frac{1}{2}}{\\rm re tr } u_p ) \\right)-   { \\frac{1}{2}}\\log\\det q\\ ] ] ( @xmath15 is the usual fermionic matrix ) from which we see that the gluino effectively has flavor number @xmath16 .",
    "expectation values of operators read @xmath17 { \\cal pf}[m ] { \\cal o}(u ) e^{-s_{gauge}[u]}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 $ ] is the pfaffian of the antisymmetric fermion matrix @xmath19 .",
    "the most suitable algorithm for this model is the two - step multiboson ( tsmb ) algorithm @xcite ; for details on its application to sym see @xcite .",
    "it relies on representing the fermion determinant in the form @xmath20 the polynomial approximations satisfy @xmath21\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the eigenvalues of @xmath22 on a typical gauge configuration are required to be in the interval @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "@xmath24 gives a crude estimate of the fermionic measure and is used in the bosonic representation of the determinant .",
    "@xmath25 is a correction factor that is accounted for by a global accept - reject step .",
    "the algorithm is made exact by a third polynomial @xmath26 through reweighting the gauge configurations in the expectation values .",
    "for the results presented we use the following samples , all at @xmath27 :    [ cols=\"<,^,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : summary ]",
    "the new results presented here essentially refer to the two samples of configurations on the @xmath28 lattice , @xmath29 , @xmath30 produced in @xcite .",
    "these correspond to a lighter gluino compared to the previous extensive analysis of the spectrum accomplished in @xcite where the largest @xmath31 value was @xmath32 .",
    "we also present preliminary results for the bigger @xmath33 lattice at @xmath29 .",
    "the available results are summarized in table [ tab : summary ] .",
    "* glueballs . *",
    "we used ape smearing with @xmath34 and @xmath35 for the glueball operators .",
    "we then averaged the effective masses over the emerging plateau .",
    "the data for the @xmath36-glueball is generally very noisy so that averages can only be taken at time - slice sparations 1 and 2 .",
    "the case of the @xmath7-glueball is more favorable ( see fig .  [ zpglueball ] ) .",
    "the statistics for the larger lattice is still too low to determine a mass .     of the @xmath7-glueball , scaledwidth=46.0% ]",
    "* gluinoballs . *",
    "the connected part of the correlation function was evaluated by choosing a random source , the disconnected by using the volume - source technique , both without smearing .",
    "the signal for the @xmath5 is reasonably good ( see fig .",

    "* gluino - glueballs . *",
    "the gluino - glue correlation @xmath37 is evaluated by calculating the propagator @xmath38 for a random source @xmath9 .",
    "ape as well as jacobi smearing for the gluino have been used with parameters ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) and ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) .    * the pseudo chiral limit . * within the ozi - approximation the connected term in the @xmath5 correlator is expected to give rise to a massless mode in the limit @xmath43 , the  adjoint pion \" @xmath44 @xcite . extrapolating values for @xmath45 at various @xmath31 s ,",
    "we find @xmath46 , which is consistent with the determination in @xcite .",

    "we plan to use better numerical technology such as variational smearing for glueballs , and stochastic estimators and spectral decomposition of the fermion propagator for the disconnected parts of the gluino - balls correlations",

    "for this better statistics are needed .",
