    "semiconductor nanostructures ( nss ) have been investigated in recent years because of their immense use in electronic and opto - electronic devices [ 1 - 3 ] .",
    "silicon ( si ) nss can be prepared on a variety of substrates ( sapphire , quartz or semiconductors ) for micro - electronic photonic device fabrication .",
    "the si nss fabricated on sapphire substrates have distinct advantages over crystalline si ( c - si ) .",
    "si - on - sapphire ( sos ) is used in large - scale integrated circuitry primarily because it provides better electrical insulation to prevent stray currents in the electronic circuits .",
    "it is also used in aerospace and military applications because of its radiation resistance properties [ 4 , 5 ] .",
    "apart from its technological importance , si nss are also studied because of change in electronic , vibrational and optical properties as a result of quantum confinement effects .",
    "the semiconductor structures can be fabricated using variety of techniques , which include , rf co - sputtering [ 6 , 7 ] , plasma decomposition of compounds [ 8 , 9 ] , laser - induced etching [ 10 , 11 ] and continuous wave laser annealing of amorphous si film [ 12 , 13 ] .",
    "ion implantation followed by subsequent annealing is another widely used technique for the fabrication of si nss [ 14 - 17 ] .",
    "ion implantation technique is used because of its simplicity and compatibility with integrated circuits and of the ease of controlling particle size and density of nss .",
    "when si implanted sio@xmath5 films are annealed in nitrogen or vacuum , si nss are formed giving rise to visible photoluminescence ( pl ) [ 18,19 ] . generally in ion implantation method ,",
    "nss of desired element can be fabricated by implanting that particular ion into any matrix .",
    "recently , giri et al . [ 20 , 21 ] have shown that si nss can be fabricated by implanting germanium ions into sio@xmath5 film on si wafer followed by annealing in an argon gas atmosphere .",
    "they showed that si nss are formed as a result of radiation - induced transfer of energy to si ions and their nucleation and growth under suitable thermodynamic conditions .",
    "further investigations of the effects induced by ion - bombardment on si films must be done .",
    "detailed studies can be done by varying the dose and the implanted ion to look into possible si nss formation .",
    "one may expect a damage of the top surface as a result of ion implantation .",
    "investigation of the damage level and possible formation of si nss in ion implanted sos films will be very useful in integrating the sos technology with microelectronics to make optical devices like si quantum dot lasers [ 22 , 23 ] .",
    "light scattering is one of the most powerful methods for studying the structures of disordered or partially ordered solids [ 24 , 25 ] .",
    "quantitative distinction between a crystalline lattice and a lattice where some degree of disorder has been introduced can be made by raman spectroscopy .",
    "raman spectra of amorphous si reveals a broad band around 470 @xmath6[26 ] , while the spectrum from crystalline form shows a sharp peak at 520.5 @xmath6corresponding to the zone - centered phonon [ 27 ] . on the other hand , zone - edge phonons , which appear only in two - phonon raman scattering ,",
    "corresponds to large wave vectors and are sensitive to short - range disorder [ 28 ] . in nss of a few nanometer size",
    ", a major modification is observed in vibrational properties due to the confinement of phonons .",
    "raman spectroscopy is widely used technique for investigating the phonon confinement effect in nss [ 29 - 33 ] .",
    "the change in the raman line - shape is useful in determining the size , shape and size distribution of nss , since phonon softening and widening of raman lines are related to the size of nss .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to make a systematic and comparative study of structural modifications in the sos films implanted with boron ( b@xmath0 ) and phosphorous ( p@xmath0 ) ions .",
    "raman studies are done on b implanted sos films as a function of b@xmath0 dose at constant ion energy .",
    "asymmetrically broadened and red shifted raman line - shapes are observed along with a hump at 475 @xmath6for samples implanted with b@xmath0 dose higher than 10@xmath7 @xmath3 .",
    "the observed raman line - shapes are analyzed carefully using phonon confinement model ( pcm ) .",
    "it is found that there is a formation of si nss in the b@xmath0 implanted samples along with an amorphous background .",
    "raman analysis was also done on sos samples implanted with heavier ( p@xmath0 ) ions . in p@xmath0",
    "implanted samples , the si nss are formed for higher ion energy ( 350 kev ) than that for b@xmath0 implanted samples ( 150 kev ) for same ion dose .",
    "pl and glancing angle x - ray diffraction ( gaxrd ) experiments are done to verify the raman result .",
    "furthermore , it is observed that si nss can be formed on crystalline sos films by implanting an ion with an appropriate ion energy and ion dose without any post annealing treatment .",
    "thin crystalline sos films of thickness 500 nm are grown by a conventional cvd process .",
    "samples b1 , b2 and b3 are prepared from crystalline sos by implanting 150 kev b@xmath0 ions with different doses of 10@xmath7 , 10@xmath8 and 5 x 10@xmath8 ions @xmath3respectively .",
    "samples p1 and p2 are prepared from crystalline sos by implanting p@xmath0 ions with fixed fluence of 5 x 10@xmath8 ions @xmath3and energy 150 kev and 350 kev respectively .",
    "details of all the studied samples are given in table 1 .",
    "the raman and pl spectra were recorded by employing a spectroscopic system consisting of a spex-1403 doublemonochromator , a hamamatsu ( r943 - 2 ) photomultiplier tube and an argon ion laser ( coherent , innova 90 ) .",
    "the raman spectra are recorded using an excitation photon energy @xmath4 2.41 ev of the argon - ion laser .",
    "the excitation photon energy of 2.6 ev was used for pl recording at room temperature .",

    "figure 1(a ) shows the raman spectrum of a crystalline sos sample showing a symmetric peak at 524 @xmath6 , which is 3.5 @xmath6blue shifted as compared to the c - si ( 520.5 @xmath6 ) . the phonon hardening of 3.5 @xmath6indicates the presence of an interfacial compressive stress of 8.7 x 10@xmath10 dyne @xmath3according to englert et al . [ 34 ] .",
    "figures 1(b ) - ( d ) shows the raman spectra from samples b1 , b2 and b3 respectively .",
    "the raman peak positioned at 524 @xmath6from crystalline sos shifts to 521 cm-1 when crystalline sos is implanted with 150 kev b@xmath0 ions at a rate of 10@xmath7 ions @xmath3as shown in fig .",

    "raman signals from amorphous and nanocrystalline si are shown by dotted and dashed lines respectively.,width=302 ]    the raman peak shift from 524 @xmath6to 521 @xmath6may be because of relaxation in the interfacial stress due to the b@xmath0 ion implantation .",
    "because of ion implantation there is a little damage to the film surface , which gives a path for the film - interface stress to be relieved partially .",
    "this type of relaxation in the stress has also been observed on porous si on sapphire [ 35 ] .",
    "dubbelday et al .",
    "[ 35 ] have shown that when the sos film is stain etched in hf : hno@xmath11 solution , crevices and cracks are formed in the film .",
    "there is a relaxation in stress as a result of increase in the porous si layer thickness on the sapphire substrate . in our sample b1",
    ", this type of relaxation in stress may take place through the damage created by ion implantation . when the dose of b@xmath0 ion is increased to 10@xmath8 , the raman peak position shifts to 518 @xmath6and asymmetrically broadened with fwhm of 11.5 @xmath6as shown in fig .",
    "the raman spectrum from sample b2 shows a hump around 475 @xmath6indicating the presence of some amorphous si background . on further increasing the dose to 5 x 10@xmath8 by keeping the ion energy same ( 150 kev ) , the raman peak downshifts further to 517 @xmath6with fwhm of 15.5 @xmath6 .",
    "the amorphous component is also increased in sample b2 because of more amorphization due to increased b@xmath0 dose .     implanted samples as a function of dose with fixed ion energy of 150 kev.,width=302 ]",
    "the variation of raman peak position and fwhm as a function of b@xmath0 implantation dose is shown in fig .",
    "2 . from the raman spectra of b@xmath0",
    "ion implanted samples in fig .",
    "1 , it can be seen that as the dose is increased , there is an increase in the intensity of the amorphous part ( 475 @xmath6 ) .",
    "the amorphization of the top sos surface as a result of increased dose have been further verified by recording the second order raman scattering spectra as shown in fig .",
    "3 . figure 3(a)-(c ) show the second order raman spectra from samples b1 , b2 and b3 respectively .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "3 that the second order raman scattering intensity diminishes with increasing b@xmath0 dose on the sample .",
    "this indicates the more and more amorphization of the sos films but complete amorphization has not taken place even at the highest b+ dose of 5 x 10@xmath8 ions @xmath3 in our case .",
    "a gradual red shift is also observed in the raman peak position in fig . 1 .        to investigate the red shift",
    "the amorphous contribution has been subtracted from the full raman data in figs .",
    "1(c ) and 1(d ) .",
    "the amorphous part is shown by dotted line and the subtracted part is shown by dashed line in figs .",
    "1(c ) and 1(d ) .",
    "the raman scattering data obtained after subtraction of the amorphous part is red shifted and asymmetric in nature .",
    "this type of behavior indicates the presence of quantum confinement effect in the samples b2 and b3 .",
    "the quantum confinement of phonons is observed in the si nss , which have been formed in the amorphous si matrix because of ion implantation . to get the information about the size of the si nss formed , the subtracted raman spectra in figs .",
    "1(c ) and 1(d ) were analyzed within the framework of the pcm [ 36,37 ] .",
    "the pcm developed by richter et al .",
    "[ 36 ] and campbell et al .",
    "[ 37 ] describes the raman line - shape of the optical phonons of low dimensional materials and has been widely reported to estimate the nss sizes [ 38 , 39 ] .",
    "taking the phonon weighing function to be a gaussian , the first - order raman spectrum can be expressed as : @xmath12 ^ 2+[\\frac{\\gamma}{2}]^2}d^3q\\right]dl\\ ] ] where ` q ' is the phonon wave vector and @xmath13 is the phonon dispersion relation for c - si .",
    "the @xmath14 is the natural line width of raman mode and ` l ' is the confinement parameter ( size of the crystallite ) .",
    "the ` l@xmath15 ' and l@xmath5 are the minimum and maximum confinement dimensions respectively .",
    "the ` n(l ) ' is a gaussian function of the form @xmath16 included to account for the size distribution of the nss . where l@xmath17 is the mean nss size and @xmath18 defines the width of the distribution .",
    "the size of the si nss obtained from the raman line - shape fitting is displayed in table 1 . the theoretical raman line - shape given by eq .",
    "( 1 ) shows a good fit with the experimental data in figs . 1 ( c ) and 1(d ) .",
    "the experimental data were best fitted with mean size of 5 nm for sample b2 and with 4 nm for sample b3 .",
    "the decrease in the nss size with increasing b@xmath0 dose is also consistent with the red shift of the raman peak position .        to further confirm the formation of si nss , pl spectroscopy is done at room temperature .",
    "figure 4(a)-(c ) shows the pl spectra from samples b1 , b2 and b3 respectively .",
    "there are two important features in fig .",
    "firstly there is a broad pl peak centered around 2.28 ev , which is independent of the b@xmath0 ion dose .",
    "secondly , there is an appearance of a pl band at 1.9 ev , which is absent in pl spectrum from sample b1 in fig .",
    "the pl peak at 1.9 ev for sample b2 shifts to 1.95 ev when b+ dose is increased from 10@xmath8 to 5 x 10@xmath8 @xmath3 .",
    "raman results in table 1 show that the size of si nss decrease with increasing the ion dose .",
    "therefore , the size dependent pl peak centered at 1.9 - 1.95 ev is attributed to the quantum confinement of electrons in si nss[40 ] .",
    "this pl peak is absent for the sample implanted with dose 10@xmath7 @xmath3 in fig .",
    "1(a ) . on the other hand , the pl peak at 2.28 ev does nt show any dependence on the size ( or implantation dose ) .",
    "this size independent pl is attributed due to the transitions between two trapped defect states as discussed by wolkin et at . [ 41 ] .",
    "the pl results are in consonance with raman scattering results in figs .",
    "1(b)-(d ) .",
    "on the basis of raman and pl results from b@xmath0 implanted films one can say that quantum confined effects can be observed in ion implanted sos films .",

    "figure 5(a ) shows the raman spectrum of p@xmath0 ion implanted sample ( sample p1 ) with a dose of 5 x 10@xmath8 and ion energy of 150 kev .",
    "one can see an amorphous structure around 475 @xmath6due to implantation with a heavier ion as compared to b@xmath0 implanted samples .",
    "figure 5(b ) illustrates the raman spectrum ( hollow squares ) from sample p2 . the raman spectrum from sample p2 shows a sharp peak at 518 @xmath6along with a hump at 475 @xmath6 .",
    "the red shifted sharp peak at 518 @xmath6indicates the presence of phonon confinement and needs further analysis .",
    "the raman result from sample p2 has been further analyzed in the same way as was done for the b@xmath0 implanted raman results in the previous section . when the amorphous part is subtracted from the full raman data , an asymmetric raman line - shape is obtained as show by dashed line in fig .",
    "subtracted data is fitted with eq .",
    "( 1 ) to get the si nss size .",
    "we get the best fit of experimental data for mean crystallite size of 5 nm which is less than the bohr exciton diameter @xmath410 nm [ 42 ] .",
    "thus we can say that the asymmetry and red shift in the raman line - shape in fig .",
    "5(b ) is due to quantum confinement of phonons in the si nss formed due to ion implantation .",
