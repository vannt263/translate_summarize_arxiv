    "commonly this process is described by including into the magnetic energy an additional term @xcite @xmath117 this model is fundamental to the systematic phenomenological description of magnetic states in noncentrosymmetric magnetic systems @xcite .",
    "interaction functional ( [ density5 ] ) plays in chiral magnetism a similar role as the _ frank energy _ in liquid crystals @xcite or _ ginzburg - landau _ functional in physics of superconductivity @xcite .",

    "the fact that thermodynamical stability of individual phases and conditions of phase transfomations between them are determined by magnetocrystalline anisotropy and other relativistic or weaker interactions means that ( i ) the basic theory only determines a set of different and unusual modulated phases , while ( ii ) the transitions between these modulated states , and their evolution in magnetization processes depends on symmetry and details of magnetic secondary effects in chiral magnets , in particular the strengths of relativistic magnetic interactions .",
