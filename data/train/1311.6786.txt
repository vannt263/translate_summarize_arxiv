    "the _ global _ treatment of asymptotically flat ( or , more generally , asymptotically simple ) spacetimes as models for isolated systems is an important topic , both in mathematical and in numerical relativity .",
    "in particular , this is relevant for a rigorous investigation of gravitational wave signals , which can be uniquely read off only at null infinity @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that certain tail decay rates at timelike boundaries ( which are often introduced as `` artificial '' outer boundaries for numerical computations ) and at null infinity are different , so that an appropriate treatment of infinity is crucial , see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein .",
    "an important ingredient for such a rigorous treatment is penrose s conformal boundary @xcite , which is obtained by isometrically embedding the spacetimes into larger lorentzian manifolds and conformally rescaling the metric , i.e.  the `` physical '' metric is replaced by a conformal metric and a conformal factor . a formulation of einstein s field equations adapted to this setting , the conformal field equations ( cfe ) , was given by friedrich @xcite . in the context of this approach , it is well - known that certain mathematical difficulties arise in the region near spacelike infinity @xmath1 . in order to cope with this problem ,",
    "friedrich has introduced yet another formulation of the field equations , the generalised cfe @xcite . moreover ,",
    "a novel representation of spacelike infinity has been given : @xmath1 , in regular cases thought of before as a point , is `` blown up '' to a cylinder @xmath2 $ ] , which connects past and future null infinity @xmath3 .",
    "the cylinder - formulation is very appealing for numerical calculations as well .",
    "recently , the `` core '' equations of the generalized cfe , a spin-2 system on minkowski background describing linearised gravitational fields near spacelike infinity , have been solved numerically with a finite - difference method ( in particular , using fourth - order runge - kutta in time ) , see @xcite . a typical drawback in this approach ( and other finite - difference schemes )",
    "is the restriction of the time step by the courant - friedrichs - lewy ( cfl ) condition . in particular , as one approaches @xmath0 , the characteristic speeds of the system diverge .",
    "consequently , the requirement that the numerical domain of dependence contain the analytical one enforces smaller and smaller time steps .",
    "hence , it is only possible to come close to @xmath0 , using a very large number of grid points in the time direction , without actually reaching it .",
    "however , since gravitational wave signals are defined at @xmath0 itself , it is desirable to include this boundary into the numerical domain .    in the present article",
    ", we address this problem in a simplified setting : we consider the conformally invariant wave equation on a minkowski background .",
    "moreover , we restrict ourselves to the @xmath4 dimensional problem in spherical symmetry .",
    "the resulting wave equations are simpler than the above mentioned spin-2 system , but mirror already important mathematical properties and difficulties of the general problem .",
    "hence , a successful numerical treatment of this model will lead the way to future applications to the linearised , or even to the full einstein equations .",
    "our main objective is to demonstrate that the wave equation near the cylinder at spacelike infinity ( and even in the entire minkowski space ) can be solved with a fully pseudospectral scheme .",
    "the underlying numerical method , which is based on the approach by ansorg _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite for solving elliptic pdes , was introduced in @xcite and later applied to several physical problems in @xcite .",
    "the main idea is to expand the unknown functions in terms of chebyshev polynomials , both with respect to space _ and _ time .",
    "this provides a highly implicit method for which , in particular , no cfl condition is required , since the solution is simultaneously obtained in the entire numerical domain .",
    "consequently , we will see that we can reach @xmath5 with a small number of grid points ( about 20 - 30 points in time direction ) instead of only approaching it asymptotically .",
    "in the following , we solve _ cauchy problems _ with data on a hypersurface @xmath6 and evolve them to future null infinity @xmath5 .",
    "thereby , we first concentrate on a vicinity of @xmath1 only , and afterwards study the same problem for all values of a radial coordinate @xmath7 , i.e.  in the entire minkowski space and not only close to infinity .",
    "a different type of initial value problem that has frequently been studied in general relativity and that is again gaining more attention in recent times , is an _ ( asymptotic ) characteristic initial value problem with data on past null infinity _ @xmath8 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for some interesting mathematical results . here",
    ", we demonstrate that this type of initial value problem , applied to the conformally invariant wave equation , can also be solved with the fully pseudospectral method .",
    "the different initial value problems considered here are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ivps ] below .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin with a quick overview of the conformally invariant wave equation and the fully pseudospectral scheme in sec .",
    "[ sec : background ] .",
    "afterwards , in sec .",
    "[ sec : i0 ] , we apply this method to the wave equation near spacelike infinity . in sec .",
    "[ sec : all ] , we consider different coordinates that cover all of minkowski space and again solve the wave equation . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : discuss ] , we summarize our results .",
    "in @xmath9 spacetime dimensions , the conformally invariant wave equation is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the ( inverse ) metric and @xmath12 the corresponding ricci scalar .",
    "this equation is conformally invariant for @xmath13 with conformal weight @xmath14 , i.e.  if @xmath15 solves the equation for a metric @xmath16 , then @xmath17 solves the equation for a conformally related metric @xmath18 with conformal factor @xmath19 .    here",
    "we consider the equation in minkowski space , i.e.  we assume that the physical metric @xmath20 is the minkowski metric , and we restrict ourselves to @xmath21 dimensions , where we have the equation @xmath22 then the conformal weight is @xmath23 .",
    "moreover , we consider only spherically symmetric solutions @xmath24 , which depend on time @xmath25 and on a radial coordinate @xmath7 alone .    in this article",
    "we look at cauchy problems , where the function values and first time derivatives of @xmath13 can be prescribed at the initial cauchy surface .",
    "we also study characteristic initial value problems , where only the initial function values can be specified .      in the following",
    "we give a short summary of the fully pseudospectral scheme , which will enable us to find highly accurate numerical solutions to the conformally invariant wave equation . for more details",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to express the unknown function(s ) in terms of truncated series of chebyshev polynomials @xmath26 , both with respect to space and time , and to reduce the differential equation ( in our case the conformally invariant wave equation ) to an algebraic system of equations .    to this end",
    ", the physical domain is first mapped to a unit square by introducing spectral coordinates @xmath27\\times[0,1]$ ] such that the initial surface corresponds to @xmath28 .",
    "then we enforce the initial conditions by expressing the unknown function @xmath29 in terms of another unknown @xmath30 with an expansion @xmath31 depending on the type of initial data ( cauchy problem or characteristic initial value problem ) .",
    "the functions @xmath32 and @xmath33 can be obtained from the given initial data at @xmath28 .    in a next step ,",
    "we approximate the new unknown @xmath34 via @xmath35 for given spectral resolution ( number of polynomials ) @xmath36 and @xmath37 . from this approximation for @xmath34",
    "we can then easily find approximations for @xmath13 and its derivatives .",
    "an algebraic system of equations for the chebyshev coefficients @xmath38 can be obtained by requiring that the wave equation ( and suitable boundary or regularity conditions , if applicable ) are satisfied at a set of collocation points . here , we choose _ gauss - lobatto _ nodes , which are defined by @xmath39 note that , instead of considering the resulting algebraic system of equations as a system for @xmath38 , we actually solve directly for the function values @xmath40 at the nodes .    finally , starting from some initial guess ( in our examples we can choose the trivial solution @xmath41 for all @xmath42 ) , we solve this system iteratively with the _ newton - raphson _ method .",
    "in order to describe a vicinity of spacelike infinity @xmath1 and to resolve the cylinder - like structure of @xmath1 , we first introduce suitable coordinates . to this end , we start from the physical metric @xmath16 of minkowski space , which takes the form @xmath43 in spherical coordinates @xmath44 .",
    "then we define new coordinates @xmath25 and @xmath7 as @xmath45 the metric can now be expressed as @xmath46 in terms of the conformal metric @xmath47 with the conformal factor @xmath48 note that this is a special case of the more general coordinates considered by friedrich @xcite , corresponding to the choice @xmath49 for the free function @xmath50 that appears in friedrich s transformation .",

    "initial data are prescribed at the thick lines and evolved into the shaded regions .",
    "spatial infinity @xmath1 is indicated with dashed lines , and dotted lines show the positions of null infinity @xmath5 and @xmath8 .",
    "the coordinates in ( a ) are adopted for studying a vicinity of @xmath1 ( see sec .  [ sec : i0 ] ) , whereas the coordinates in ( b - d ) cover the entire minkowski space ( see sec .  [ sec : all ] ) . ]",
    "now we can look at the conformally invariant wave equation corresponding to the metric .",

    "the characteristics of the wave equation are lightlike curves with respect to the metric @xmath57 and have the form @xmath58 where different values of the constant @xmath59 correspond to different characteristics .",
    "we intend to solve a cauchy problem with data at @xmath6 , which will then be evolved until @xmath60 , and we would like to obtain the solution @xmath13 in some vicinity of @xmath1 , say for @xmath61 . on the other hand , if we strictly restrict ourselves to the domain @xmath62\\times[0,1]$ ] , then we would need to prescribe boundary conditions at the outer boundary @xmath63 .",
    "however , since there is no physical reason why @xmath13 should satisfy any particular conditions at @xmath63 , `` artificial '' conditions at this boundary  even though mathematically perfectly valid  would be rather unphysical .",
    "therefore , we instead choose a slightly larger domain that contains the square @xmath64\\times[0,1]$ ] , but where the outer boundary is the ingoing characteristic @xmath65 , see the shaded region in fig .",
    "[ fig : ivps]a .",
    "then there is no need for boundary conditions at this curve .",
    "instead , we can impose the wave equation itself there .    at @xmath56 (",
    "i.e.  at @xmath1 ) the wave equation becomes an _",

    "the latter equation has the first integral @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",
    "this shows that @xmath13 will be singular at @xmath56 , @xmath60 , i.e.  the point where @xmath1 and @xmath5 intersect , also is a well - known property of friedrich s conformal field equations , see @xcite .",
    "but as we see , this problem already shows up in the wave equation discussed here . in both cases ,",

    "similarly to our numerical studies near @xmath1 , we solve the problems with different resolutions and compare the numerical error to the interpolation error .",
    "the resulting convergence plots are shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : ivps]b .",
    "the three examples are described in table [ tab : exb ] . ]",
    "we observe a similar behaviour as for the wave equation near @xmath1 : the convergence curves are initially approximately linear , corresponding to exponential convergence , until saturation near machine accuracy is reached .",
    "moreover , the error due to the numerics is about 1 - 3 orders of magnitude larger than the interpolation error . in the case of example 2 , we observe that the numerical error is again growing for @xmath102 .",
    "this happens occasionally in the fully pseudospectral scheme due to accumulation of rounding errors for higher resolutions .",
    "next we consider the characteristic problems ( ii ) and ( iii ) , where , in the latter case , we both solve the regular and singular wave equations .    for problem ( ii ) , we prescribe the values of @xmath13 at @xmath8",
    ". then we solve the wave equation with the boundary condition @xmath100 at @xmath56 and with condition at the intersection of @xmath56 and @xmath8 .    in case of the characteristic problem ( iii ) for the regular wave equation",
    ", we again prescribe the values of @xmath13 at @xmath8 . however , this time this initial condition is not achieved with an expansion of the form  it turns out that this leads to numerical instabilities in the present case where the entire minkowski space is considered .",
    "instead , we just use the condition that @xmath13 be equal to the prescribed initial values at @xmath28 , i.e.  here the function values of @xmath13 themselves ( and not @xmath34 ) are the unknowns in the numerical method . furthermore , at @xmath56 we again impose the regularity condition @xmath100 .",
    "finally , in the characteristic problem ( iii ) for the singular wave equation , we prescribe values for @xmath78 at @xmath8 .",
    "as in the regular case before , we impose this condition directly instead of enforcing it with an expansion . as boundary conditions we use @xmath100 at @xmath56 and @xmath103 at @xmath5 and @xmath1 .",
    "convergence plots for the three described problems , using the same exact solutions from table  [ tab : exb ] as before , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : conc ] .",
    "( this time we do not compare the numerical error with the interpolation error , which would lead to similar plots as above . )     convergence plots for the characteristic initial value problems .",
    "again we have studied the three numerical examples described in table [ tab : exb ] .",
    "initial data are prescribed at @xmath8 and then evolved until @xmath6 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ivps]c ) or to @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ivps]d ) . in the latter case ,",
    "both the regular wave equation for the conformal metric and the singular wave equation corresponding to the physical metric are solved . ]",
    "as one should expect , we observe the smallest errors in the case where only the lower half @xmath104 of minkowski space is considered , whereas the accuracy drops if we evolve the data on @xmath8 to @xmath5 , since the solution has then to be computed on a much larger domain .",
    "interestingly , in the latter case , we obtain comparable errors to calculate the conformally related function @xmath105 , then we would loose some accuracy .",
    "for , applying lhpital s rule , we would need to differentiate @xmath15 at the boundaries ( where @xmath106 ) . and with each differentiation of a function approximated in terms of chebyshev polynomials , the error increases by about 1 order of magnitude . ] for the regular and singular formulations  the only difference being that for the singular case , slightly higher resolutions are needed to reach the saturation level .",
    "this indicates that , from a numerical point of view , the regular formulation of an equation is not necessarily preferred to a singular formulation  provided suitable numerical techniques are applied to treat the singular case .",
    "an example for the distribution of the error over the numerical domain is shown in fig .  [ fig : errb ] ( which should be compared to the similar plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : erra ] ) .",
    "this time the largest error is assumed at or near @xmath92 , corresponding to the origin @xmath56 of minkowski space . also note that the error is not zero at @xmath28 , since for this calculation the initial conditions are not enforced exactly , as described above . in some numerical examples , a peak in the error",
    "is found at @xmath92 , @xmath95 , but otherwise we obtain very similar plots for other examples and resolutions .     the numerical error for the ( regular ) wave equation in the entire minkowski space .",
    "the plot is obtained for example solution 2 from table  [ tab : exb ] with spectral resolution @xmath107 . ]",
    "as a model problem for solving einstein s equations near the cylinder at spacelike infinity @xmath1 , we have considered the conformally invariant wave equation on minkowski background . with the fully pseudospectral scheme from @xcite , it was possible to obtain highly accurate numerical solutions ( with numerical error in the order @xmath108 to @xmath109 , close to machine accuracy of our double precision code ) for a small number of grid points .",
    "in particular , the method does not fail at @xmath0 or at the intersection @xmath110 of the cylinder and @xmath3 , where the equation degenerates . instead , it was possible to include both @xmath0 and @xmath110 into the numerical domain .",
    "this is in contrast to finite - difference approaches , where @xmath0 can only be reached asymptotically as a consequence of the cfl condition .",
    "we have also compared the numerical treatment of the regular wave equation ( with respect to the conformal metric ) to the singular wave equation ( with respect to the `` physical '' metric ) . in both cases we have achieved comparable numerical accuracy , which shows that both formulations have equal rights from a numerical point of view ( whereas the `` regular formulation '' is preferential in analytical approaches , since formally singular terms complicate the calculations ) .",
    "these observations suggest that our fully pseudospectral scheme should be a promising method also for treating more general equations ( e.g. , the spin-2 system or the full einstein equations ) and less symmetric spacetimes ( e.g. , axisymmetric dimensional problems @xcite . ] or even completely non - symmetric solutions ) .",
