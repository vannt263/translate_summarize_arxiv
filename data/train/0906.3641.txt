    "the existence of long - term cyclical variations in the spin rate of psr b1642@xmath003 has been known from the analysis of the first timing data of the pulsar gathered in 19691982 @xcite . during this 13-year interval ,",
    "the timing residuals of the pulsar exhibited oscillatory but not strictly periodic variations with an amplitude of about 15 ms and a cycle duration of about 1000 days @xcite .",
    "the extension of the observational interval up to 30 years from 1969 to 1999 has shown that the timing residuals have a cyclical behavior during all this interval and the observed variations are characterized by an amplitude varying from 15 to 80 ms and spacing of maxima varying from 1000 to 2600 days @xcite . it has been noticed that the observed shape of these cyclical residuals does not depend on the time span of the data analyzed .",
    "the most plausible explanation suggested by the authors @xcite was that the long - term cyclical changes in residuals could result from free precession .",
    "free precession due to changes in beam orientation would cause periodic , correlated changes in both the pulse shape and the first frequency derivative .",
    "strictly periodic variations in the pulse profile and pulse arrival times from psr 1642@xmath003 have not been detected .",
    "nevertheless , robust cyclical behavior in residuals has been interpreted as evidence for slow precession of the neutron star spin axis due to a nonspherical shape of the pulsar .",
    "here we establish that the observed cyclical behavior of the timing residuals from psr b1642@xmath003 is a result of continuous generation of peculiar glitches whose amplitudes are modulated by some periodic large - scale process .    in this paper , the study of the pulsar s rotation behavior is based on an analysis of the timing data collected for 40 years at three different observatories .",
    "the archival jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) data include the first timing observations of the pulsar b1642@xmath003 , which were carried out at 2388 mhz between 1969 and 1982 using antennas of the deep space network of nasa @xcite .",
    "the jodrell bank observatory ( jbo ) data were obtained at frequencies of 408 , 610 , 1400 , and 1600 mhz over the interval 19811999 and taken from the earlier paper @xcite .",
    "the pushchino radio astronomy observatory ( prao ) data include the timing data between 1991 and 2008 and a separate observing session in 1984 september  december .",
    "since 1991 , the pulsar b1642@xmath003 has been observed at 102 and 112 mhz using the large phased array of the pushchino observatory , which is a linearly polarized transit telescope .",
    "a 64@xmath720 khz multi - channel radiometer was used .",
    "the resolution of the recorded signals was either 2.56 or 1.28 ms .",
    "the duration of each session determined by the width of the antenna beam at the source declination was 3.2 min for the declination of psr b1642@xmath003 .",
    "the mean pulse profile in each 20 khz channel was obtained by synchronous adding of 500 individual pulses with a predicted topocentric pulsar period .",
    "after dispersion removal , all the channel profiles were summed to form a mean pulse profile for the given observing session .",
    "the topocentric arrival times of the pulses for each observing session were calculated by cross - correlating the mean pulse profile with a standard low - noise template .",
    "the topocentric arrival times collected at jbo , prao , and the geocentric arrival times obtained from the archival jpl timing data were all referred to as the barycenter of the solar system at infinite frequency using the program tempo and the jpl de200 ephemeris .",
    "the coordinates of the pulsar that are required for this reduction were taken from @xcite , together with a proper motion equal to zero @xcite .    in order to analyze the variations in the pulsar rotation",
    ", a second - order polynomial describing the slow down of the rotational star was fitted to the experimental data .",
    "the rotational pulse phase @xmath8 at the barycentric arrival times @xmath9 was calculated as @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are the pulse phase ( measured in cycles ) , rotation frequency , and first frequency derivative at some reference time @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the phase residuals , obtained as differences between the observed phase and the phase predicted from a timing model , were used for improving the spin - down parameters of the pulsar .",
    "pulsar parameters @xmath12 and @xmath15 measured over the 40-year time span of observations are given in section 3 .",
    "residuals derived with these new parameters were used to study variations in the pulsar rotation .",
    "glitches observed in the rotation frequency of the pulsar b1642@xmath003 are peculiar because their properties differ from those of normal glitches .",
    "usually normal glitches occur as sudden jumps in the pulsar s rotation frequency , followed by a post - glitch relaxation representing a sum of the decaying @xmath16 and the permanent @xmath17 components @xcite .",
    "the large glitches show significant exponential decay which is estimated by the parameter @xmath18 .",
    "normal glitches are characterized by short rise times of less than one day . in contrast , the pulsar b1642@xmath003 exhibits small glitches that have long rise times of about 400500 days and show significant exponential relaxation ( @xmath19 ) after a glitch .",
    "the timing residuals after subtraction of the best - fit spin - down model are presented in figure  [ resid ] over the period from 1969 to 2008 .",
    "it is seen that timing residuals show clear cyclical behavior over all the 40-year interval .",
    "the mean rotation parameters of the pulsar are very stable and are derived with high accuracy over the fit interval mjd 4041454825 : @xmath20 hz , @xmath21 at the epoch mjd 40414.1297 .",
    "the measured value of the second derivative , @xmath22 , is mainly determined by an asymmetry of the residual curve with respect to the @xmath23-axis over the time span analyzed .",
    "so , a corresponding braking index , @xmath24 , may not be related to the secular slowdown of the pulsar s rotation .",
    "the central part of the residual curve has a one - year gap between 1983 july and 1984 august .",
    "the trend of the curve is well traced on this interval , but in order to study variations in the rotation frequency of the pulsar in more detail , this gap needs to be removed .",
    "the recovery of the residual curve was based on the method of prediction of the expected pulse arrival times for particular epochs .",
    "for the interval , which corresponded to the descending slope of the residual curve between 1983 june and 1986 january , the values of @xmath25 were determined by the fitting the timing model .",
    "using the @xmath25 obtained and the first point of the indicated interval as a reference point , the expected pulse arrival times were predicted for the epoches spaced by 30 days within the indicated interval . the timing model fitted to all the points of this interval showed that the timing residuals , corresponding to the predicted pulse arrival times , coincided within 1 ms with the residuals , corresponding to the experimental points from the observing session in 1984 september  december and the first points of the 1986 data set .",
    "figure  [ history](a ) shows the timing residuals of the pulsar in which the gap in the data observed was removed .",
    "figures  [ history](b ) and  [ history](c ) show the time behavior of the frequency residuals @xmath26 and frequency derivative @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the values of @xmath12 and @xmath27 were calculated from the local fits , performed to arrival time data over intervals of @xmath6 200 days that overlapped by 100 days .",
    "the use of the predicted pulse arrival times allowed us to define rather precisely the epoch and the amplitude of the cycle that were hidden by a gap in the residual curve .",
    "figure  [ history](b ) shows that the pulsar experienced eight glitch - like events between 1969 and 2008 .",
    "these events represent peculiar glitches because they are characterized by a slow , almost linear increase in the rotation frequency @xmath12 with a long rise time of 400500 days .",
    "all these glitches have a small absolute amplitude observed in the range @xmath28 hz .",
    "this corresponds to the fractional glitch amplitude of @xmath1 .",
    "the largest glitch size ( glitches 4 and 7 ) is greater than the smallest one ( glitch 1 ) by a factor of @xmath6 3 .",
    "all the glitches observed exhibit similar post - glitch behavior .",
    "the standard glitch model was not fitted to arrival time data because of the specific properties of the glitches observed .",
    "the exponential curve was fitted to the frequency residuals @xmath26 .",
    "figure  [ history](b ) shows that the post - glitch relaxation of glitches 3 , 5 , and 7 is well described by an exponentially decaying component with a time constant of @xmath29 days . though the exponential curve is not well fitted to the smaller glitches , it is possible to suppose that all the glitches observed show a significant exponential decay with a large value of @xmath19 .",
    "it is clearly seen from figure  [ history](c ) that the mean value of the frequency derivative @xmath15 , marked on the plot by the horizontal line , is rather stable over 40 years of observations . here , as in the case of slow glitches @xcite , the increase in the rotation frequency @xmath12 during the glitch is accompanied by the decrease in the frequency derivative @xmath15 .",
    "as is seen from this plot , the peaks of @xmath30 across the glitch have an approximately identical magnitude for all the glitches equal to @xmath31 .",
    "this makes up @xmath32 of the mean value of @xmath33 .",
    "the peaks of @xmath34 characterize the steepness of the front in @xmath26 which practically does not depend on the glitch amplitude .",
    "an analysis of the changes in @xmath26 showed that the rotation frequency of the pulsar b1642@xmath003 undergoes continuous generation of peculiar glitches .",
    "a result of this process is clearly seen in figure  [ history](b )  a decrease in @xmath26 after one glitch at once passes into an increase in @xmath26 for the next glitch .",
    "figure  [ relation ] shows that there is a strong linear correlation between the glitch amplitude and the time interval following the glitch .",
    "the two curves indicate that the larger is the glitch amplitude @xmath35 , the larger is the relaxation time interval after the glitch @xmath36 and the larger is the time interval to the next glitch @xmath37 .",
    "we found no evidence of a correlation between the glitch amplitude and the time interval preceding the glitch .",
    "a linear model was fitted to seven experimental points because the parameters of the last , eighth glitch are not yet known completely .",
    "the linear relation obtained between the glitch amplitude @xmath35 and the post - glitch time intervals is described by the expressions : @xmath38 @xmath39 where uncertainties in the parameters are in parentheses and refer to the last digits .",
    "both the fitted straight lines have a similar slope of about @xmath40 hz day@xmath3 and are spaced on the @xmath23-axis by 400500 days , which is a time of a glitch arising .",
    "the solid line @xmath37 passes through the origin of coordinates .",
    "the dotted line @xmath36 indicates the existence of a lower bound for allowed amplitudes .",
    "glitches , having an amplitude less than @xmath41 hz , should not exist because they will show negative relaxation time .    the linear relation obtained between the glitch amplitude @xmath35 and the post - glitch interval to the next glitch @xmath37 allows us to predict epochs of new glitches . in figure",
    "[ relation ] , the amplitude of the eighth glitch marked by the asterisk indicates that the interval to the next glitch should be @xmath6 2000 days .",
    "therefore , the next , ninth glitch will occur around mjd 56300 or in 2013 .",
    "the experimental parameters for eight peculiar glitches plotted in figure  [ history](b ) are given in table  [ one ] .",
    "the parameters are shown in the following order : the glitch number ; epoch of the point @xmath42 , which corresponds to the maximum deviation of @xmath43 ; epoch of the point @xmath44 , which corresponds to the minimum deviation of @xmath45 ; the glitch amplitude @xmath46 ; the time interval after the glitch @xmath47 ; and the time interval to the next glitch @xmath37 . as the eighth glitch still proceeds , some of its parameters are predicted according to relations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "these parameters are printed bold .",
    "figure  [ scheme0 ] shows the relation between the glitch amplitude @xmath35 and the glitch number in the sequence of the glitches observed .",
    "it is seen that the first six experimental points , marked by circles around the crosses , make up two rectilinear branches .",
    "the fourth glitch has the maximum amplitude .",
    "after this glitch , the increase of the glitch amplitude turns into the decrease of the glitch amplitude with the same rate . the ascending branch ( points 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) is well described by the straight line @xmath48 with the coefficients @xmath49 , and the descending branch ( points 4 , 5 , 6 ) has the coefficients @xmath50 .",
    "figure  [ scheme0 ] clearly shows that the glitch amplitude is modulated by the sawtooth - like function , both the branches of which have an identical slope of an opposite sign @xmath51 hz . as a result of the modulation ,",
    "the amplitude is changed discretely from glitch to glitch with a step of @xmath52 hz as its magnitude depends on the serial number of the glitch in a given sequence of the glitches . for further calculations ,",
    "the ascending branch of the modulation function will be approximated by a straight line @xmath53 and the descending branch by a straight line @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the glitch number 1,2,3 , ... , @xmath56 .",
    "the point of intersection of these two lines has the coordinates , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , that correspond to the observed parameters of the fourth glitch .",
    "figure  [ scheme0 ] shows that the experimental points well agree with the points calculated for these two branches .    according to relations ( 2 ) and ( 3 )",
    ", the discrete changes of the glitch amplitude will cause the discrete changes of the post - glitch intervals ( either increase or decrease ) with a step of @xmath6 580 days .",
    "the discrete changes of these parameters allow us to estimate more precisely the lower bound of the allowed glitch amplitudes .",
    "the first glitch in the given sequence of the glitches has the observed amplitude of @xmath59 hz and is a minimal glitch that can be recorded .",
    "a still smaller glitch should have the amplitude of @xmath60 hz , but this glitch can not exist as it will exhibit a negative relaxation time interval @xmath36 , as it follows from figure  [ relation ] . from here , the allowed interval for the glitch amplitudes observed is in the range @xmath61 hz and has the width equal to @xmath62 hz .    as is seen from figure  [ scheme0 ] ,",
    "experimental points 7 and 8 produce the second descending branch of the modulation function that is parallel to the first branch .",
    "the derived relation @xmath54 indicates that the predicted amplitudes of these two glitches should be 2.4 and @xmath63 hz , respectively .",
    "the comparison of these values with the values observed , indicated in table  [ one ] , shows that the differences between them make up the same value of about @xmath64 hz .",
    "this value is very close to the width of the allowed interval for the glitch amplitudes @xmath65 .",
    "we make a conclusion that the amplitudes observed in glitches 7 and 8 are a result of a forced increase in their initial amplitudes by the value @xmath65 .",
    "figure  [ scheme0 ] shows that this unusual phenomenon does not exclude and confirms the existence of the modulation process .",
    "the phenomenon of a forced increase in the initial amplitudes of glitches 7 and 8 is also reflected on the timing residuals . figure  [ history](a ) shows that the pulse arrival times for cycle 7 are earlier as compared with those for cycle 4 , though these glitches have a similar shape in figure  [ history](b ) .",
    "it looks as if the pulse arrival times kept the information on partial identity of the indicated glitches . at the low frequency of 112 mhz",
    ", we found no evidence of any changes in the shape or intensity of the mean pulse profile among cycles 6 , 7 , and 8 .",
    "a study of the peculiar glitches in the rotation frequency of the pulsar b1642@xmath003 has shown that the amplitudes of these glitches are modulated by some periodic large - scale sawtooth - like function .",
    "we should define the period and amplitude of this modulation function .",
    "the upper bound of modulation is determined by the amplitude of the fourth glitch so this glitch is at a cross point of the ascending and the descending branches of the modulation function . the glitches with the greater amplitude should not be observed .",
    "the lower bound of the modulation function is as yet unknown from the observations .",
    "an analysis of the data showed that only three modulation schemes that include an even quantity of glitches 8 , 10 , or 12 are possible .",
    "a modulation period can not include less than eight glitches as this quantity of glitches is already revealed .",
    "note that the ascending and descending branches of the modulation function are formed by the predicted magnitudes of the glitches .",

    "they are located in the allowed range and define the observed magnitudes of the glitches .",
    "* scheme 1*. a modulation period includes eight glitches as is shown in figure  [ scheme1 ] .",
    "it means that each rectilinear branch will be formed by the amplitudes of the four glitches .",
    "the lower bound of the modulation function will be determined by the predicted amplitude of the eighth glitch because the eighth glitch will lie at a cross point of the descending branch of the first modulation period and the ascending branch of the second modulation period .",

    "we make a conclusion that if the pulsar glitches are due to a variable coupling between the solid crust and the superfluid interior , then in the case of psr b1642@xmath003 this variable coupling is provided by the predicted and regular events .",
    "an analysis of the timing behavior of psr b1642@xmath003 over the 40-year data span from 1969 to 2008 has shown that the pulsar rotation frequency is subject to continuous generation of peculiar glitches whose amplitudes are modulated by some periodic large - scale process .",
    "we pay attention to two aspects of the phenomenon observed .",
    "the first process gives rise to peculiar glitches having similar properties .",
    "these glitches are characterized by small amplitudes , long rise times of about 400500 days , and significant exponential decay ( @xmath95 ) after the glitch .",
    "the amplitude of these glitches and the time interval to the following glitch obey a strong linear relation .",
    "the second process modulates the amplitudes of the peculiar glitches in such a manner that their magnitudes depend on the serial number of the glitch in a given modulation period . as a result of such modulation ,",
    "the glitch amplitude changes from glitch to glitch with a discrete step of @xmath96 hz in the range @xmath5 hz .",
    "this is accompanied by the corresponding changes of the time intervals to the following glitch with a discrete step of @xmath6 600 days in the range 9002700 days .",
    "we established that the modulation process has a sawtooth character .",
    "the most probable amplitude of this modulation may be equal to @xmath97 hz and the most probable modulation period may be equal to @xmath6 60 years .",
    "besides , the modulation process gives rise to some additional modulation branches that are parallel to the main modulation branches .",
    "these branches are composed of the glitches whose predicted amplitudes should be less than the allowed lower limit @xmath98 hz , that is , such glitches should not exist .",
    "nevertheless , these glitches exist , but they have the amplitudes that are a result of a forced increase in the predicted amplitudes by the value @xmath65 .",
    "the nature of cyclical changes in the timing residuals from the pulsar b1642@xmath003 lies in a continuous generation of peculiar glitches whose amplitudes are modulated by some periodic large - scale sawtooth - like function .",
    "the amplitudes and spacings of the maxima of the cyclical residuals are a reflection of the glitch amplitudes and the post - glitch time intervals in the rotation frequency .",
    "the existence of the periodic sawtooth - like modulation of the glitch amplitudes will cause an absolutely identical picture of the timing residuals in each modulation period or every 60 years .",
    "the indicated properties of the peculiar glitches allow us to predict the epochs and the magnitudes of new glitches in the rotation frequency of this pulsar , as is shown in table  [ two ] .",
    "psr b1642@xmath003 is the first glitching pulsar that shows that the pulsar glitches can be the predicted and regular events .",
