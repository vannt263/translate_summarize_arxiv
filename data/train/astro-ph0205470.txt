    "galactic black hole candidates ( bhc ) exhibit transitions between x - ray states distinguished by their different spectral and timing properties @xcite . the classification of these states is not rigorously defined and is an active topic of debate .",
    "the accretion rate seems to be the most important parameter determining the spectral states , although it is argued by @xcite that two independent parameters are needed to describe the states , and the second parameter could possibly be the size of the comptonizing region .",
    "five states have been frequently quoted : the off state , the low - hard state ( ls ) , the intermediate state ( is ) , the high - soft state ( hs ) and the very - high state ( vhs ) .",
    "they are named after their spectral and luminosity properties , but also show very distinct temporal and radio properties .",
    "the hs is dominated by a soft spectrum with little or no timing noise ( rms amplitude less than a few % ) , and the radio emission is quenched @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the ls is dominated by a power law component in the x - ray spectrum , which is often interpreted as being associated with a hot electron corona , and shows very strong band limited noise ( up to 50% rms amplitude ) and quasi - periodic - oscillations ( qpo ) . moreover , the radio observations often reveal a compact jet during this state ( * ? ? ?",

    "the geometry of the accretion system in each state and the triggering mechanism for the state transitions are not well understood @xcite .",
    "the most notable observational properties during the transition to the ls are ( 1 ) the appearance of qpos and strong band limited noise in the power density spectrum ( psd ) and the hardening of the power law component in the x - ray spectrum , possibly indicating the formation of a hot corona , ( 2 ) the evolution of the characteristic frequencies of the power spectrum which might indicate retreating of the inner - disk radius @xcite , ( 3 ) optically thin synchrotron radio emission indicating plasma ejections and formation of compact radio jets @xcite , and ( 4 ) a decrease in coherence and an increase in time lags observed in cyg x-1 which might be related to the radio jets @xcite .    here",

    "we also analyzed the time lags and coherence function between 2  6 kev and 6  15 kev energy band light curves .",

    "[ fig : lor ] , except for the first observation , each observation requires at least two broad lorentzians to fit the continuum , and a qpo ( see table  [ table : par_lor ] for the fit parameters ) . for obs  1 ,",
    "the 95% confidence upper limit on the rms amplitude of a qpo in 0.1 - 20 hz range with a @xmath4 is 2.8 % . the qpo is always the second peaked component in the psd . although the second peaked component in obs  4",

    "we call the broad lorentzians in the fit @xmath16 , where @xmath7=1 is the lowest frequency peak lorentzian .",
    "the qpo is not counted and always referred as the qpo throughout the paper .",
    "there is an overall shift to lower frequencies with time for both the wide lorentzians and the qpos ( see fig .",

    "[ fig : par_lz]b . the rms amplitudes of individual lorentzian components do not show a regular trend and can be found in table  [ table : par_lor ] .",

    "moreover , the 6  15 kev rms amplitude is higher than the 2  6 kev amplitude . for the remaining observations , the 2  6 kev rms amplitude is higher , and the lorentzians peak at the same frequency ( within 1-@xmath20 error ) .",
    "it was shown recently that @xmath13 is an important parameter in terms of frequency correlations @xcite .",
    "having observed these correlations in other sources , we decided to look for them in xte  j1650@xmath0500 , and plotted peak and qpo frequencies as a function of each other .",
    "two sets of parameter correlations are apparent as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : psal ] ; @xmath21 and @xmath22 show a correlation similar to the one reported by @xcite , and @xmath22 shows a correlation with the qpo frequency which is shown to exist for other black hole and neutron star sources @xcite .",
    "due to low statistics and large errors , we could not conclude whether @xmath23 correlates with @xmath22 .",
    "one can use the cross - spectral elements of the fourier transform to obtain other information .",
    "the coherence function , for example , is a fourier - frequency - dependent measure of the degree of linear correlation between two concurrent time series , in this case light curves measured simultaneously in two energy bands @xcite .",
    "for example , unity coherence means that there exists a linear transformation function between two energy bands for each piece of light curve that we are averaging and this function is the same for every piece .",
    "the fourier time lag is a fourier - frequency - dependent measure of the time delay between two concurrent time series @xcite .",
    "it is related to the phase of the average cross power spectrum between the `` soft energy '' light curve and the `` hard energy '' light curve .",
    "we use the convention that the sign of the lag is positive when hard photons lag soft photons .",
    "observations of hard lags in bhcs have often been interpreted as evidence for compton upscattering in a hot electron gas @xcite , however simple comptonization models have difficulty explaining the magnitude of lags @xcite .",
    "[ fig : coh_lags ] shows the evolution of mean coherence and mean time lag in 1    10 hz where they are least affected by the poisson noise .",
    "the mean lag decreases whereas the coherence function increases with time , and they both approach an asymptotic value .",
    "the time lag decays from 24 ms to around 6 ms , and the coherence increases from 0.6 to unity .",
    "note that during the hs , the average coherence is consistent with being zero , therefore time lags have no physical meaning @xcite .",
    "this is the third source after cyg  x-1 and gx  339@xmath04 to show enhanced lags during the state transition .",
    "we also added the evolution of the hardness ratio of the x - ray spectrum to fig .",
    "[ fig : coh_lags ] .",
    "the ratio is taken between the hexte cluster a count rate in 17  150 kev band and the pca count rate per pcu in 3  10 kev band .",
    "the hardness ratio is inversely related to the power - law index ( @xmath24 ) of the x - ray spectrum , and preliminary spectral analysis confirms their anti - correlation . @xmath24 and average lag",
    "have been shown to correlate for cyg x-1 @xcite and gx  339@xmath04 @xcite .",
    "the anti - correlation of the hardness ratio and the mean lag shows that xte  j1650@xmath0500  is similar to these sources .",
    "the temporal properties of xte  j1650@xmath0500  during the transition to the hard state are very similar to what has been observed for other bhcs , namely 4u  1630@xmath047 @xcite , cyg  x-1 @xcite , and also xte  j1550@xmath0564 @xcite . for 4u  1630@xmath047 ,",
    "a sharp transition was seen with most of the changes in the temporal properties occurring in less than 2 days during the decay of the 1998 outburst .",
    "similarly , for xte  j1650@xmath0500 , obs  1 and our last hs observation are only one day apart . for 4u  1630@xmath047 ( during its 1998 decay ) and for xte",
    "j1550@xmath0564 ( during its 2000 decay ) , the qpo frequency and the break frequency showed a decreasing trend , whereas the overall rms amplitude showed an increasing trend after the transition @xcite , as observed in xte  j1650@xmath0500 . on the other hand , the 3  20 kev x - ray flux decreased during and after the transition for these sources , whereas it increased during the transition for xte  j1650@xmath0500 .",
    "this is likely due to the hardening of the power law index and the energy range of pca .",
    "this behavior can be explained if we adapt the two parameter description of @xcite and assume that the second parameter is the size of the comptonizing region .",
    "then , the mass accretion rate through the disk may decrease , but the increasing size of the comptonizing region may result in many hard photons in the pca range which can increase the x - ray flux .",
    "we also note that there could be significant flux below 3 kev , and bolometric fluxes might be considerably higher , especially for the hs .",
    "finally , it seems that the changes observed in xte  j1650@xmath0500  during the transition to the hard state resemble best to the transitional episodes of cyg x-1 .",
    "first of all , the mean x - ray time lag in 1  10 hz frequency range is longer and the mean coherence is low during the state transition as compared to later observations , just as in cyg x-1 @xcite .",
    "the peak frequencies of @xmath17 and @xmath25 are significantly higher and @xmath26 is absent during the state transition , again very similar to what has been observed in cyg x-1 . correlations between the peak frequencies of the lorentzians , which we will discuss in section  [ sec : cor ] , are also similar .      during the transition ,",
    "the average time lags are enhanced compared to the following observations as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : coh_lags ] . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "this behavior has been seen before for cyg x-1 and for gx  339@xmath04 @xcite . in cyg x-1 ,",
    "the mean lags do not change during the ls and the soft state500  and soft state of cyg x-1 might not be correct . ] and they have similar values , but they only increase during the failed state transitions .",
    "@xcite suggested that one possible reason is the optically thin radio outflows during the state transition which creates an additional comptonizing area at its base that increases the time lags .",
    "it seems that the quenching of jets during the hs and the is / vhs , optically thin outflows ( and simultaneous building of a compact jet ) during the state transitions , and optically thick emission during the ls are typical properties of bhcs @xcite . for xte  j1650@xmath0500",
    ", there is no radio measurement during the state transition , but an inverted radio spectrum is observed during the hard state ( s. corbel , private communication ) , and it is likely that a large outflow occurred during the state transition as in other bhcs .",
    "therefore , extended and hot material from optically thin ejections or from a compact jet building up could be the reason for the enhanced lags as hypothesized for cyg x-1 and gx  339@xmath04 , and the reduced coherence could simply be a result of additional scatterings in the hot material .",
    "the spectral modeling of the corona and the reflection features also seem to support this idea for cyg x-1 and gx  339@xmath04 @xcite .",
    "the reason for the lack of enhanced lags after obs  2 could also be due to different lorentzian components acting at the same frequency range .",
    "@xcite discussed the case that the overall measured time lag may be a composite of time lags inherent to each individual coherent psd component .",
    "although the individual time lags can be fairly large , the composite lag might be small . for obs  1",
    "the only apparent component present is @xmath17 .",
    "although we can not rule out the presence of a qpo , its rms upper limit amplitude is low compared to rms amplitude of @xmath17 . for obs  2 , the 1  10 hz band",
    "is dominated by @xmath17 ( 14% rms amplitude ) , where @xmath25 contributes little ( 2% rms amplitude ) . moreover ,",
    "the qpo , which is also within this frequency range , is weak .",
    "for the remaining observations , significant part of @xmath25 moves into this frequency range  and @xmath25  in 1  10 hz range are 11% and 15% , respectively . ] and qpos are strong ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lor ] ) .",
    "this could be the reason for the reduced time lags after obs  11 .",
    "note that similar arguments have been raised to explain the enhanced lags in cyg  x-1 @xcite .",
    "one way to check this argument is to compare the frequency dependent lags with the shape of the power spectrum .",
    "unfortunately , the quality of our time lag spectrum is not good enough to do this .",
    "however , the anti - correlation of the mean coherence with the mean lag seems to counter this argument since one would expect a decrease in the mean coherence in a frequency band where different processes are contributing .",
    "a steady state is reached after our third observation , and the time lags ( correspondingly the phase lags ) are small . for these cases",
    ", the lorentzians could be due to individual coherent processes .",
    "one can still obtain near unity coherence if the phase lags are small as illustrated in @xcite , see especially equation ( 3 ) of this paper . in fig .",
    "[ fig : coh_lags ] , we also included the evolution of the hardness ratio , since it anti - correlates with the mean time lag .",
    "note that it also anti - correlates with the peak frequencies as in the case of cyg x-1 and gx  339@xmath04 .",
    "the implications of this relation have been discussed extensively for gx  339@xmath04 by @xcite .",
    "various papers address the correlations between certain fit parameters of the psd for x - ray binaries and show that these correlations exist for decades of frequency range @xcite .",
    "one correlation is between the break frequency ( nearly equivalent of @xmath22 ) and the frequency of a `` bump '' or qpo above this break for different types of x - ray binaries : black hole candidates , atoll sources , millisecond x - ray pulsar and z sources @xcite .",
    "we obtained a box of frequency range from fig .",
    "2a of their paper which the correlation exists and over - plotted this to our qpo frequency versus @xmath22 plot .",
    "when we plot the break frequency - qpo frequency correlation from these fits , we obtained slightly better agreement with the wijnands correlation . ] in fig .",
    "[ fig : psal]a .",
    "this plot shows that we can add xte  j1650@xmath0500  to the list of various other x - ray binaries for which this correlation holds .",
    "there is another correlation reported by @xcite between the narrow qpo frequency and the frequency of a peaked lorentzian component that occurs at frequencies higher than the qpos . in our case",
    "this could be the qpo frequency vs @xmath21 or qpo frequency vs @xmath23 .",
    "the former is not consistent with the correlation reported by @xcite , and the latter is consistent within 1@xmath20 error bars , however the error bars on @xmath23 are quiet large ( see table  [ table : par_lor ] ) .",
    "the interesting result is that the correlation between @xmath22 and @xmath21 for xte  j1650@xmath0500  is consistent with the correlation reported by @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : psal]b .",
    "this is not very surprising since all these correlations have issues with the identification of the related components @xcite .",
    "the same correlation between @xmath22 and @xmath21 is seen for cyg x-1 also , adding one more to the similarities list .",
    "perhaps the most interesting result of this paper is the shifting of the peak frequency of @xmath17  to a higher frequency with increasing energy for obs  1 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : datmod ] .",
    "this kind of behavior has been seen with _",
    "ginga _ in two sources before , gx  339@xmath04 and gs  1124@xmath068 @xcite .",
    "all those observations were in the vhs , except for one observation in gs  1124@xmath068 , where it was during the transition to the ls .",
    "this is the second time such a shift has been observed during a state transition .",
    "@xcite interpreted the shifts as a result of shots with energy dependent amplitudes and profiles .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : frqsh ] that after obs  1 , there is no shift in the peak frequencies .",
    "this is hard to explain with the shot - noise models since it requires sudden removal of the energy dependence from the shot profile .",
    "we attribute the frequency shift to a geometrical effect .",
    "we adapt the idea of the corona being the part of a large vertically stretched conical outflow which explains enhanced lags and reduced coherence as discussed in @xcite .",
    "one can add a temperature profile to the vertical scale such that the base of the outflow has a higher temperature .",
    "then , the seed photons from the inner disk will interact predominantly with the higher temperature part of the jet at its base and will be scattered to higher energies . assuming that the higher frequency variability in the accretion disk is created close to the inner edge , the high energy power spectrum would peak at higher frequencies .",
    "similarly , seed photons originating away from the inner edge , which creates the low frequency variability , would interact predominantly with the cooler , higher altitude parts of the outflow .",
    "when the large outflow is over , the corona shrinks in the vertical scale which would cause a decrease in the x - ray lags and an increase in the coherence .",
    "moreover , the temperature variation could be either absent or greatly reduced compared to the large outflow case which would also explain the disappearance of the frequency shift as observed for xte  j1650@xmath0500 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the shift in the peak frequencies as a function of energy has been observed during the vhs and transitions .",
    "the radio emission is quenched in the is / vhs , but a corona probably exists .",
    "although this corona is probably not related to the `` base of the jet '' or an `` optically thin outflow '' as suggested in our model to explain xte  j1650@xmath0500  during the transition , the overall geometry in the is / vhs might be similar , perhaps on a smaller scale . a systematic search on the frequency shift effect during the vhs for xte  j1650@xmath0500 , and other sources during the is / vhs and during the transitions can increase the number of constraints on the geometry of the accretion flow .",
    "the similarities of temporal properties to those of other known black hole systems suggest that xte  j1650@xmath0500  is also a black hole system . especially the similarities to cyg x-1 are remarkable . here is a summary of the temporal properties :    * the state transition is sharp in terms of the temporal properties with the appearance of band limited noise in the psd .",
    "the rms amplitude increases from 4% upper limit in hs to @xmath116% during obs  1 .",
    "the last hs observation and obs  1 are only one day apart . *",
    "the psd can be characterized by broad lorentzians and qpos .",
    "the characteristic frequencies of these components decrease after the transition to the ls occurs , which can be interpreted as retreating of the inner disk radius as discussed in @xcite for other bhcs .",
    "the total rms amplitude also increases during this time . *",
    "the peak frequencies obey the correlations reported by @xcite and @xcite . *",

    "<S> the evolution of the power spectrum as well as the lag and coherence behavior during the state transition are similar to the state transitions observed for other black hole sources , especially cyg x-1 . </S>",
    "<S> the temporal properties during the transition to the low state put constraints on the accretion geometry of xte  j1650@xmath0500  and may have implications for all black hole binary systems . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest a possible geometry and evolution of a jet+corona+disk system based on enhanced lags and peak frequency shift during the transition . </S>"
