    "the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) experiments have played an important role in establishing and developing the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and electroweak ( ew ) sector of the standard model ( sm ) . at hera ,",
    "the first @xmath4 collider operating at a centre - of - mass energy of @xmath5gev , the neutral current ( nc ) and charged current ( cc ) dis processes are being studied since 1992 with increasing precision by the h1 and zeus experiments in a largely new kinematic domain at low @xmath1 and high @xmath3 .",
    "the experimentally measurable kinematic variable @xmath1 stands for the momentum fraction carried by the struck parton in the quark - parton model , and @xmath3 the negative of the four - momentum transfer squared of the exchanged bosons .",
    "in this talk , a few recent measurements at low @xmath1 and high @xmath3 are reported : precision proton structure function @xmath0 , gluon density @xmath2 from a next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) qcd analysis of @xmath0 , charm contribution to @xmath0 , longitudinal structure function @xmath6 , and nc and cc cross - sections at high @xmath3 .",
    "what is measured experimentally is the cross - section . for the nc process",
    ", the cross - section can be expressed in terms of @xmath0 , @xmath6 , and parity violating term @xmath7 : @xmath8\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the helicity function with @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the dominant contribution @xmath12 arises from the photon exchange and the term @xmath13 accounts for contributions from the @xmath14 interference and the @xmath15 exchange . at @xmath3 well below @xmath16 ,",
    "both @xmath13 and @xmath7 are negligible .",
    "the second term in eq.(1 ) is also negligible if @xmath17 is not too large ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "similarly for the cc process , the cross - section can also be related to the corresponding structure functions . in the leading - order approximation",
    "this is given by : @xmath19\\,,&&\\\\ \\frac{d^2\\sigma^-_{\\rm cc}}{dxdq^2}=\\frac{g_f^2}{4\\pi x}\\left(\\frac{m^2_w}{m^2_w+q^2}\\right)^2\\left[x(u+c)+(1-y)^2x(\\overline{d}+\\overline{s})\\right]\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the fermi coupling constant .",
    "contrary to the nc process , where @xmath12 is independent of the lepton beam polarity , the @xmath4 cc processes probe different quark types .    the most precisely measured reduced cross - section dependence on the kinematic factor is removed , e.g.  @xmath21 . ]",
    "@xmath22 sa far at hera is shown in fig.[fig : f2_x ] as a function of @xmath1 for a fixed @xmath3 value ranging from 1.5gev@xmath23 to 150gev@xmath23 .",
    "( 160,190)(0,-190 ) ( 5,-205 )    the h1 measurement is based on their 18pb@xmath24 @xmath25 data taken in 1996 and 1997 for @xmath26 and a dedicated run of 2pb@xmath24 for @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "the statistical precision at @xmath28 is now better than 1% with a typical systematic precision of @xmath29% .",
    "the h1 data at @xmath30 together with fixed target data  @xcite at high @xmath1 have been analysed using the nlo dglap evolution equations  @xcite to provide predictions ( h1 qcd fit ) for @xmath22 ( full curves ) and @xmath12 ( dashed curves ) .",
    "the data at high @xmath17 , which do not enter the fit , agree well with the predicted @xmath22 but deviate from @xmath12 showing the sensitivity to @xmath6 .",
    "this sensitivity has been exploited by h1 with an extracted @xmath6 as shown in fig.2 .",
    "( 160,80)(0,-80 ) ( -27.5,-185 )    ( 160,150)(0,-150 ) ( -12.5,-200 )    the hera data at low @xmath1 are unique as they can be used to extract the gluon density @xmath2 .",
    "the results of the zeus analysis are presented in fig.3 based on their previous @xmath0 data  @xcite .",
    "the relative magnitudes show that the rise of @xmath0 at low @xmath1 for @xmath3 around 1gev@xmath23 is actually dominated by the quark singlet distribution @xmath31 $ ] while the rise for @xmath3 at higher values can be attributed to the dominant gluon distribution @xmath2 .",
    "the charm production mechanism can be tested experimentally using tagged @xmath32 decaying via @xmath33 .",
    "the measured inclusive @xmath32 production cross - section  @xcite can be described by nlo prediction  @xcite for charm produced via photon - gluon fusion . extrapolating the measured cross - section into the full phase space",
    ", the open charm contribution to @xmath0 , @xmath34 , has been determined .",
    "the results reported here are from zeus using their 1996 - 1997 data ( 37pb@xmath24 ) , a more than tenfold increase compared to the previous studies  @xcite . the ratio of @xmath34 over @xmath0 is shown in fig.4 .",
    "the @xmath34 , which contributes about 20% to @xmath0 , increases as @xmath3 grows and as @xmath1 falls , and agrees well with the nlo prediction .",
    "( 160,150)(0,-150 ) ( 17.5,-160 )    the charm production data have further been used by h1 to determine in an alternative way the gluon density @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "these results , though less precise , provide a powerful check of the @xmath2 determined from the qcd analysis of the @xmath0 data .",
    "the nc cross - sections at high @xmath3 have been obtained by the h1 and zeus collaborations using fully available @xmath4 data  @xcite .",
    "the h1 results cover @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the results at high @xmath1 are shown in fig.5 .",
    "the data are compared with predictions derived from a slightly different fit  @xcite from the one mentioned earlier but using also only low @xmath3 @xmath25 data .",
    "the data , though limited in statistical precision , agree fairly well with the predictions except for a systematic excess of the @xmath25 data at @xmath37 and @xmath38 and a step behaviour at @xmath39 between the h1 and the fixed target data . the excess , though less significant with respect to",
    "what has been reported earlier based on 1994 - 1996 @xmath25 data  @xcite , remains to be clarified .",
    "the data also present a clear evidence for the ew effect associated with the @xmath15 exchange at high @xmath3 in the nc process .",
    "( 160,165)(0,-165 ) ( -7.5,-167.5 )    ( 160,165)(0,-165 ) ( -7.5,-210 )    the cc cross - sections have also been measured  @xcite .",
    "the difference in the @xmath25 and @xmath40 scatterings shows the large selectivity in the lepton quark coupling and the potential to constrain @xmath41 and @xmath42 flavours in a region that is free of nuclear binding effects .",
    "to summarise , the structure function @xmath0 measured by the hera experiments at low @xmath1 and @xmath3 has now reached a precision comparable with that of fixed target experiments . the gluon density determined from a nlo qcd analysis of @xmath0 data agrees well with that determination based on the tagged @xmath32 samples .",
    "the charm contribution to @xmath0 has been measured in an extended kinematic ranges with improved precision .",
    "experimental uncertainties of these measurements are expected to be further reduced when all available data will have been analysed .",
    "both nc and cc cross - sections from @xmath25 and @xmath40 collisions at high @xmath3 are measured .",
    "the electroweak effect has been observed for the first time at hera in the @xmath4 nc cross - sections .",
    "the different quark contributions to the cc cross - sections have been experimentally established providing potential for constraining the valence quark densities in the future with more precise measurements .",
    "hera is currently running with @xmath25 collisions and will be upgraded in 2000 with a factor of 5 increase in its peak luminosity and the possibility of having polarised beams .",
    "these data provide an exciting opportunity both in further precision tests of the standard model and in searching for new physics beyond it .    9 h1 collab . , see e.g.  m.  klein , proceedings of the 19th international symposium on lepton and photon interactions at high - energies , aug.9 - 14 , 1999 , stanford , usa .",
