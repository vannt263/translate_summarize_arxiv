    "nanoelectromechanical systems ( nems ) enable the detailed study of the interaction between electrons , tunneling through a nano - scale device , and the degrees of freedom of a mechanical system .",
    "the electronic current affects the mechanical system and vice versa .",
    "the dimensions of systems used in recent experiments range down to scales , where the observation of fundamental quantum behavior for a comparatively macroscopic object is possible @xcite .",
    "the influence of strong electron - phonon coupling in molecules or suspended quantum dots yields highly interesting effects @xcite , like the franck - condon blockade , where the influence of the mechanical system suppresses the electronic current @xcite , or switching in molecular junctions @xcite .    in non - equilibrium ,",
    "a standard approach to solve the dynamics of nems is to do perturbation theory in a tunnel hamiltonian , which has been successfully done up to the co - tunneling regime @xcite .",
    "this is a well - explored path , where the dynamics is described by master equations or generalizations thereof in liouville space .",
    "many interesting physical results can be obtained via this approach , e.g. avalanche - type molecular transport @xcite or laser - like instabilities @xcite .",
    "these methods produce good results in the range of high bias , where non - markovian effects can be neglected .",
    "to gain access to the small bias regime , one has to work perturbatively in the system - oscillator instead of the system - leads coupling @xcite .",
    "alternatively , if the oscillator is treated in a semiclassical regime , feynman - vernon influence functional techniques are suitable @xcite .    in a previous work",
    ", we combined a semiclassical analysis with an adiabatic approach @xcite , where we assumed the oscillator movement to be slow compared to the electrons which are jumping through the system .",
    "the condition @xmath0 then followed from this approximation , where @xmath1 denotes the tunneling rate of the electrons and @xmath2 is the oscillator frequency .",
    "the most interesting results , such as negative damping and limit cycles , were achieved in the regime where the oscillator and the electrons act on the same time scale .",
    "but in the latter regime , the adiabatic approach was at the limits of its validity .",
    "in recent publications different approaches , e.g. based on scattering theory @xcite , were used to go beyond the adiabatic approximation or to verify the range of validity for this approach @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we go one step further and present numerical results for a completely non - adiabatic approach .",
    "we apply our method to two simple nems models , the single and the two - level system .",
    "we work in the semiclassical regime where an expansion around the classical path is performed .",
    "the advantage of this method is that we are non - perturbative in the system - leads coupling , because the exact electronic solutions are included . in the non - adiabatic approach",
    ", we can treat the oscillator and the electrons on the same time scale without further constrains .",
    "therefore , we modify our adiabatic path - integral approach , obtaining an explicit time - dependent perturbation . as a consequence , we have to calculate system quantities numerically in a full time dependent manner .",
    "this allows us to critically assess the validity of the adiabatic results . by comparing the outcomes of the adiabatic and the non - adiabatic approach we find a qualitative accordance",
    "the same features arise in both approaches and the stationary results predominantly coincide , but there is no quantitative accordance in the time - dependent regimes .",

    "thereby we show that the oscillations of the mechanical subsystem lead to an oscillating current with fixed frequency .",

    "the electronic system itself consists of a few electronic levels which are connected to two macroscopic leads .",
