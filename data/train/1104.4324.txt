    "we study the topological behaviour of various quota complexes as the quota is changed .",

    "this is used both in generating random complexes and in studying the persistant shapes / homology of random data sets .    in this paper we first discuss some basic topological properties of quota sets .",

    ", the basic topology of quota complexes is studied especially scalar - valued quota complexes .",
    "one of the key results is ( all the relevant topological definitions can be found in that section ) :    let @xmath32 $ ] be a scalar valued quota complex , then @xmath3 is homotopy equivalent to a bouquet of spheres",
    ". let @xmath33 be a vertex of minimal weight , then there is one sphere of dimension @xmath30 in the bouquet for every face @xmath34 of dimension @xmath30 in @xmath3 , not containing @xmath33 , such that @xmath35 .    if @xmath3 is a vector valued quota complex of weight dimension @xmath36 then @xmath3 can be covered by @xmath36 scalar valued quota complexes .",
    "as long as @xmath3 has no `` shell vertices '' we have @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the category of the space @xmath3 .",

    "these quota systems are then applied to examples in number theory ( for the basic background needed in number theory see for example @xcite or @xcite ) :    the prime complex is the full simplicial complex with vertex set equal to the set of primes @xmath40 . for a fixed integer @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the quota complex on vertex set @xmath43 and quota @xmath44 ( thus the actual vertex set will be all primes less than @xmath44 and the faces will be collections of such primes whose sum is less than @xmath44 . )    in section  [ section : prime complex ] we study this basic prime complex and show    let @xmath45 be an even integer @xmath46 , then @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 are the unique odd ( respectively even ) integer in the interval @xmath50",

    "the behaviour observed is similar to that found in the study of random simplicial complexes ( see @xcite ) and to behaviour observed in the birth - death process in the theory of continuous markov chains ( see @xcite ) .    in section  [ section : euler ]",

    "in order to clarify the issue , we introduce the logprime quota complex which is the simplicial complex on the set of primes as vertices but with the weight of a vertex @xmath60 being @xmath68 .",
    "we then study how the euler characteristic of this quota complex changes with quota and obtain :    let @xmath69 be the logprime complex with quota @xmath70",
    ". then @xmath71 where @xmath65 is the mbius function . the riemann hypothesis , that the nontrivial zeros of the riemann zeta function lie on the critical line , is equivalent to the growth condition @xmath72 for all @xmath73 . in fact , in this case the reciprocal of the zeta function will equal a certain difference of @xmath74-functions associated to @xmath75 for @xmath76 .",
    "the substance of this theorem is really due to the work of titchmarsh ( see @xcite ) who gave an equivalent statement to the riemann hypothesis based on the rate of growth of merten s function .",
    "however we include it to point out that the problem also can be cast as a question about quota complexes .    in section  [ section : square complex ] we give data for similar complexes encoding the distribution of integer squares and cubes .",
    "for example one can let @xmath77 be the simplicial complex on vertices the positive integer squares less than @xmath44 and with the faces consisting of collections of positive integer squares whose sum is less than @xmath44 .",
    "similarly one can define a complex @xmath78 where cubes replace squares .",
    "one then gets similar flavor theorems :    if @xmath77 is the square complex , then @xmath77 is homotopy equivalent to a bouquet of spheres and @xmath79 is equal to the number of ways to write @xmath80 as a sum of @xmath53 distinct positive integer squares @xmath81 .",
    "thus @xmath77 , @xmath41 , is connected if and only if @xmath80 is not a positive integer square .",
    "it is simply connected if and only if @xmath80 is not a positive integer square or the sum of two distinct positive integer squares @xmath82 .",
    "if @xmath78 is the cube complex , then @xmath83 is equal to the number of ways to write @xmath80 as a sum of @xmath53 distinct positive integer cubes @xmath84 .",
    "thus the change in the homology of these complexes as quota is varied encodes various waring type problems .",
    "data describing the growth of @xmath85 for these two complexes as a function of @xmath44 is also presented in that section .    as a final arithmetical application , in section  [ section : divisor complex ]",
    "we define for any integer @xmath86 , the divisor complex @xmath87 whose vertices consist of the proper positive integer divisors of @xmath88 and whose faces consist of collections of such divisors whose sum is less than @xmath88 .",
    "( hence we are using quota @xmath88 ) . this complex encodes the distribution of the divisors of @xmath88 , keeping track of which collections of divisors have sums less than @xmath88 or greater or equal to @xmath88 .",
    "recall an integer @xmath86 is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less than @xmath88 , perfect if the sum of its proper divisors is equal to @xmath88 , and abundant if the the sum of its proper divisors is greater than @xmath88 .",
    "we obtain the following theorem :    for any @xmath86 , @xmath87 is homotopy equivalent to a bouquet of spheres where there is one @xmath51-sphere for every collection of @xmath53 proper divisors of @xmath88 , not including 1 which sum to @xmath89 .",
    "thus if @xmath88 is deficient , @xmath87 is contractible .",
    "thus @xmath88 is perfect if and only if @xmath87 is homotopic to a sphere of dimension @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the number of positive integer divisors of @xmath88 .",

    "data is presented in section  [ section : divisor complex ] which shows an example of an odd number whose complex @xmath87 is spherical and of dimension close to @xmath90 but not equal .",
    "this odd number is  close \" to being an odd perfect number in a topological sense ; of course the existence of an actual odd perfect number is still open .",
    "even perfect numbers are in bijective correspondence with mersenne primes and it is an open question whether there are infinitely many of these .    in section  [ section :",
    "counting ] , a generating function for euler characteristics of quota complexes is found and a quota - complex formulation of lehmer s conjecture is provided among other things .    in the final section ,",

    "let us write @xmath436 note @xmath437 is just a finite product of entire functions so is entire with zeros only lying on the imaginary axis of the form @xmath438 where @xmath439 and @xmath126 an integer .",
    "consider the case where @xmath43 is the set of primes @xmath440 for some @xmath441 and set quota @xmath295 .",
    "consider  random \" variables @xmath442 which are just constant at the log - prime values .",
    "the corresponding density functions are delta measures centered at the corresponding log - primes and the corresponding  random \" complex is just the logprime complex .",
    "we will apply theorem  [ thm : exptop ] to this scenario .",
    "if the reader is worried about the the fact that the density functions @xmath93 are not continuous with compact support , just replace the delta measures with very small continuous bumps of mass 1 and compact support localized around these log - primes . since there are no serious benefits of the more rigorous approach we will just use the delta measures for this example .",
    "by theorem  [ thm : logprime ] , we have @xmath443 .",
    "note the fourier transform of the delta measure @xmath444 centered at @xmath68 is @xmath445 and so the formula from theorem  [ thm : exptop ] becomes @xmath446 doing a change of variable @xmath447 one finds : @xmath448",
    "we have seen the standard morse theoretic problem of studying the change of topology of a space as a parameter is varied can be applied to the study of quota complexes as the quota is varied . in this case",
    "the quota determines the complex through a set of linear inequalities . a similar though more difficult nonlinear version of this problem is encountered in the study of random data sets through the method of persistant homology .    in this context a finite set of data points in @xmath7 is studied by considering the space @xmath449 $ ] consisting of the union of open balls of radius @xmath6 around these points .",
    "the topology of @xmath449 $ ] changes from being discrete when @xmath6 is very small to a single contractible blob when @xmath6 is very large .",
    "usually @xmath6 is varied in a range corresponding to reasonable error estimates for the experiment and the persistant features of the topology of @xmath449 $ ] as @xmath6 ranges over this error interval are looked for and attributed as features of the data set .    in this context one often forms the associated vietoris - rips complex instead of the actual space @xmath449 $ ] for computational simplicity .",
    "this is an abstract simplicial complex where there is one vertex for each of the original data points and where @xmath450 $ ] is a face if and only if the radius @xmath6 balls around the @xmath451 have pairwise nonempty intersection .",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath452 .",
    "thus instead of the linear inequalities present in scalar quota complexes , these inequalities are nonlinear ones saying the diameters of various sets should be below quota @xmath453 . in these cases , one has to do more work to study the change of topology as for example theorem  [ thm : scalarquotathm ] does not apply .",
    "please see @xcite for more details .",
    "we will not pursue this here .",
    "in order to state topological structure results about vector weighted quota complexes , we need to recall the definition of the lusternik - schnirelmann category of a space .",
    "let @xmath3 be a topological space .",
    "let @xmath88 be a nonnegative integer .",
    "we say that @xmath454 if @xmath3 can be covered by @xmath455 open sets @xmath456 such that each @xmath457 is contractible in @xmath3 , i.e. , the inclusion map @xmath458 is homotopically trivial .",
    "the category of a space is hence either a nonnegative integer or infinite .",
    "note @xmath459 if and only if @xmath3 is contractible .",
    "@xmath38 is a homotopy invariant of @xmath3 i.e. , homotopy equivalent spaces have the same category .",
    "the notion of category was introduced to give a lower bound on the number of critical points of a morse function on a smooth manifold .",
    "it has also proved fruitful in proving bounds on degrees of nilpotence of various algebraic structures associated to a space @xmath3 .",
    "( see @xcite for example . )",
    "note any closed @xmath88-manifold can be covered by a finite number of open sets homeomorphic to @xmath7 and hence contractible .",
    "thus all closed manifolds have finite category .",
    "a sphere @xmath460 has @xmath461 as a sphere can always be covered by two contractible open sets ( an upper and lower hemisphere ) but is itself not contractible .",
    "if @xmath462 is @xmath88-dimensional complex projective space then @xmath462 can be covered by @xmath455 charts which are contractible pieces so @xmath463 .",
    "however cup product arguments can be used to show that @xmath464 and so @xmath465 for all integers @xmath466 .    a bouquet of positive dimensional spheres @xmath3 has @xmath459",
    "if it is an empty bouquet ( just a point ) or @xmath467 otherwise . to see this let @xmath468 be an open thickening of the attaching point of the bouquet and @xmath469 be @xmath3 minus the attaching point .",
    "@xmath468 is contractible and though @xmath469 is not in general contractible , it is always contractible in @xmath3 i.e. , the inclusion map @xmath470 is homotopically trivial .",
    "this is because each component of @xmath469 is contractible and @xmath3 is path connected as the bouquet does not involve @xmath147-spheres .",
    "a bouquet with @xmath147-spheres involved can have category larger than @xmath361 as the bouquet will not be path connected .",
    "each @xmath147 sphere gives an extra point component which increases the category by @xmath361 . to address the issue of @xmath147-spheres in quota complexes we define the concept of a `` shell vertex '' in a quota complex .",
    "let @xmath3 be a finite scalar quota complex with vertex of minimal weight @xmath121 .",
    "a vertex @xmath30 of @xmath3 is called a shell vertex if @xmath471 .",
    "note by theorem  [ thm : scalarquotathm ] , @xmath3 is homotopy equivalent to a bouquet of spheres where there is one @xmath147-sphere for each shell vertex not equal to @xmath121 .",
    "thus @xmath472 where @xmath473 if there are any positive dimensional spheres in the bouquet and @xmath474 if not .    for a vector valued quota complex , for the @xmath63th coordinate of the weights and",
    "quota we can find a vertex @xmath475 of minimal weight for that coordinate . then a vertex @xmath30 is called a shell vertex if @xmath476 for * some * coordinate @xmath63 .",
    "let @xmath3 be a finite vector weighted quota system with weight dimension @xmath36 , weight function @xmath477 and quota @xmath478 .",
    "so @xmath479 and quota @xmath480 .",
    "@xmath3 is then the union of @xmath36 scalar quota complexes .",
    "furthermore if @xmath3 has no shell vertices , we have @xmath37 .",
    "thus @xmath39 provides a homotopy invariant lower bound for the weight dimension of a quota complex with no shell vertices .",
    "let @xmath364 be the complex determined by the @xmath63th component of the weight - quota system for @xmath367 . then by definition @xmath481 . by theorem  [ thm : scalarquotathm ] ,",
    "each @xmath364 is homotopy equivalent to a bouquet of spheres . if @xmath3 has no shell vertices then no @xmath147-spheres occur in these bouquets and hence each @xmath364 can be covered by two open sets which are contractible in @xmath364 and hence in @xmath3 .",
    "thickening up these open sets so that they are open in @xmath3 , we see that @xmath3 can then be covered by @xmath482 open sets , each contractible in @xmath3 .",
    "thus @xmath37 by definition .",
    "the rest of the theorem then follows readily .",
    "in this appendix we provide a proof that every finite simplicial complex is a quota complex .",
    "this fact already appeared in unpublished work of manuel alves who was working on independent undergraduate research on voting theory under the guidance of the first author .",
    "given a monotone voting system on a set @xmath0 of voters , the voting complex associated to the system is an abstract simplicial complex based on @xmath0 whose faces consist of the losing coalitions of the system .",
    "the proof of the following theorem then parallels the fact that every monotone voting system is a ( vector valued ) quota system .",
    "let @xmath483 denote the number of vertices in a face @xmath34 .",
    "if @xmath3 is a finite simplicial complex on vertex set @xmath0 then @xmath3 is a quota complex i.e. , there exists a weight function @xmath484 for some @xmath88 and quota @xmath485 such that @xmath3 is the simplicial complex associated to quota system @xmath486 $ ] .",
    "furthermore the weights and the quota can be chosen to have positive integer coordinates and these coordinates can be assumed to all be distinct .",
    "let @xmath487 denote the set of maximal faces ( facets ) of @xmath3 .",
    "order these faces @xmath488 .",
    "define a scalar valued quota system @xmath489 by setting @xmath490 set quota @xmath491 .",
    "it is simple to check that the subcomplex of the simplex on @xmath0 determined by the quota system @xmath492 $ ] is exactly the simplex @xmath493 and its faces .",
    "letting @xmath25 be the function with coordinates the @xmath494 and @xmath26 be the vector with coordinates the @xmath495 , then @xmath496 $ ] is subcomplex of the simplex on @xmath0 given by @xmath497 . hence @xmath498 is the quota complex @xmath499 $ ] .",
    "define as usual the weight of a face to be the sum of the weights of the vertices in the face . since @xmath3 has a finite number of faces , only a finite number of vectors occur as weights of the faces of @xmath3 .",
    "it is clear then that we may change the coordinates of the quota by subtracting sufficiently small positive numbers from the coordinates so that the quota determines the same complex as the original quota system and has distinct positive rational entries and that these quota coordinates are not acheived as the weight of any face in the simplex on @xmath0 .",
    "it is then clear that we can perturb the weights of the vertices by small amounts so that the resulting quota complex still determines the same complex and so that the weights of the vertices consist of vectors of distinct positive rational numbers and such that no weight vectors share any coordinates which each other or with the quota vector .",
    "finally scaling all weight vectors and the quota vector by the least common multiple of the denominators of all rational numbers involved , we get a quota system determining the same complex as the original , where weights and quota have positive integer coordinates and all these coordinates are distinct .",
    "we adopt the setup and notation from the beginning of section  [ section : prime complex ] in this section of the appendix .    furthermore set @xmath500 and @xmath501 .",
    "we have that @xmath502 so if we take @xmath503 then for @xmath343 with @xmath504 , @xmath505 .",
    "the global behavior of the family of functions @xmath506 is easy to ascertain ; we collect some of the features in the following proposition .",
    "[ prime complex : proposition ] let @xmath507 be the smallest positive integer such that @xmath508 , and for @xmath509 let @xmath510 such that @xmath511 .",
    "then for all @xmath512 , @xmath513 , @xmath514 and @xmath506 has exactly one critical value in @xmath515 which is a maximum .",
    "moreover , if @xmath516 is the critical point of @xmath506 in @xmath515 , then @xmath517 and @xmath518 .      in order to establish the bounds on @xmath516 we use the following sequence ( see @xcite pg . 10 ) @xmath520 namely , consider the sequences @xmath521 then , @xmath522 is a bounded decreasing sequence and @xmath523 is a bounded increasing sequence , so they converge .",
    "furthermore @xmath524 and @xmath525 as @xmath526 , so @xmath527 as @xmath528 .",
    "hence , since @xmath522 is decreasing we must have that @xmath529 , and since @xmath523 is increasing we must have that @xmath530 .",
    "so @xmath531 and since , by stirling s formula , @xmath532 it follows that @xmath533 ."
