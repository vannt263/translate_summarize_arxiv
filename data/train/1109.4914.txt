    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate some topological questions arising from the study of supersymmetric lattice models in statistical physics .",

    "square , triangular or hexagonal grids are the most notable examples .",
    "the vertices of the graph can be occupied by particles , such as fermions , which satisfy the _ hard - core _ restriction : two adjacent vertices can not be occupied simultaneously . a configuration of particles which satisfies this assumption is an _",
    "independent set _ in the graph @xmath0 .    associated with @xmath0",
    "there is a simplicial complex called the _ independence complex _ of @xmath0 and denoted @xmath1 .",
    "its vertices are the vertices of @xmath0 and its faces are the independent sets in @xmath0 .",
    "it is a standard object studied in combinatorial algebraic topology .",
    "there is a close connection between the simplicial and topological invariants of @xmath1 and certain characteristics of the corresponding lattice model which are of interest to physicists .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss this relationship in detail ; we refer to @xcite and we limit ourselves to presenting just the most basic dictionary :    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "we will now show for completeness that induced matchings with dominating transversals in @xmath2 correspond to sphere wedge summands in the homotopy type of @xmath3 .",
    "this is stronger than just saying that they define a nonzero homology class .",
    "the results of this section are not needed in the previous calculations , where analyzing the cohomology - homology pairing is sufficient ( and easier ) .",
    "[ lem : retract ] let @xmath4 be an induced matching of size @xmath5 with a dominating transversal in @xmath2 .",
    "denote by @xmath6 the embedding induced by the inclusion @xmath7 .",
    "then there is a homotopy equivalence @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the homotopy cofibre of @xmath10 .",
    "since @xmath11 is a maximal face of @xmath3 we can remove it and form the simplicial complex @xmath12 whose geometric realization is obtained by removing the interior of @xmath11 .",
    "then we have a cofibre sequence @xmath13 i.e. @xmath3 is the homotopy cofibre of the inclusion @xmath14 . but",
    "this inclusion is null - homotopic since it factors through the space @xmath15 , homeomorphic to the disk @xmath16 . as a consequence @xmath17 now",
    "the fact that @xmath18 is a contractible subcomplex of @xmath12 implies that @xmath19 together with @xmath20 this ends the proof .",
    "to analyze our situation further we need to understand homotopy cofibres of maps between independence complexes .",

    "the space @xmath24 is obtained in precisely the same way .",
    "now we can prove the main result of this section .",

    "then , by lemmas [ lem : retract ] and [ lem : cofibre ] we have a splitting @xmath35 if @xmath36 then we are done .",
    "otherwise note that the pairs @xmath37 for @xmath38 define a sequence of induced matchings with dominating transversals in the graph @xmath39 .",
    "indeed , to build @xmath39 we did not add any edges within @xmath2 itself , so the matchings are still induced .",
    "moreover , by ( [ eq : seq ] ) every set @xmath40 contains a vertex which is not in @xmath41 , hence it is adjacent to the new vertex of @xmath39 , which means @xmath40 is a dominating set in @xmath39 .",
    "the condition ( [ eq : seq ] ) still holds , so by induction @xmath42 and that completes the proof .",
    "the last result applies to all the situations of the previous section , once one orders the matchings in the lexicographical order of their defining @xmath43-words .",
    "in particular we get a splitting of @xmath44 which includes a wedge sum of exponentially many spheres .",
    "in this section we improve , for the hexagonal dimer grids @xmath45 , the upper bound of @xcite .",
    "we develop a more general result , which is modeled entirely on the technique of @xcite with just two small improvements .",

    "there are @xmath103 graphs that can arise in this way , with only @xmath104 isomorphism classes @xcite , and the homology of their independence complexes can be easily calculated by a computer @xcite .",
