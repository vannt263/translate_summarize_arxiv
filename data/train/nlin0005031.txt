    "the problem of distinguishing a chaotic from an ordered trajectory in a non - integrable hamiltonian system has been a topic of active investigation since the pioneering work of hnon and heiles ( 1964 ) .",
    "initially , when the study was restricted to 2-d systems , the work was done through surface of section plots .",
    "later , when systems with more than 2-d were considered , the method of choice was the calculation of the lyapunov characteristic numbers ( lcns ) ( benettin et al .",
    "1976 , froeschl 1984 ) .",
    "unfortunately both the above methods suffer from the same drawback , namely they are not able to distinguish easily an ordered from a `` sticky '' chaotic trajectory .",
    "various methods have been devised since then to address the above problem , namely the distinction of an ordered from a chaotic trajectory using a relatively short - time trajectory segment .",
    "these methods generally fall into two main classes : those that use frequency or correlation analysis of a time - series , constructed by the values of generalized co - ordinates ( or functions of them ) , and those that use the geodesic divergence of initially nearby trajectories . in the first class",
    "belong the `` old '' method of the rotation number ( contopoulos 1966 ) , the frequency map analysis developed by laskar ( laskar et al .",
    "1992 , laskar 1993 ) and the power spectrum analysis of quasi - integrals developed by voyatzis & ichtiaroglou ( 1992 ) . in the second belong the probability density function analysis of stretching numbers developed by froeschl et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and voglis & contopoulos ( 1994 ) and the fast lyapunov indicators method developed by froeschl et al .",
    "each one of the above methods has its own advantages and weaknesses ; in particular some of them are more suitable to test _ large sets of trajectories _ rather than _ single ones _",
    ", some are more efficient for _ 2-d systems _ rather than for _ n(@xmath02)-d systems _ and some perform better for _ mappings _ rather than _",
    "flows_.    in 1997 ,",
    "contopoulos & voglis introduced a new method for distinguishing chaotic from ordered trajectories , which does not belong to any of the above mentioned two classes but , instead , may be classified as `` mixed '' .",
    "this new method is based on the analysis of the probability density of _ helicity _ and _ twist angles_. voglis & efthymiopoulos ( 1998 ) and subsequently froeschl & lega ( 1998 ) showed that the twist angles method is very efficient in testing _",
    "phase space regions _ , at least in cases of 2-d systems , where the twist angles can be easily calculated .",
    "more recently voglis et al .",
    "( 1998 , 1999 ) proposed two new and very efficient methods , namely the method of `` dynamical spectral distance '' ( dsd ) , which is particularly suitable for the characterization of single trajectories in 4-d maps , and the method of `` rotational tori recognizer '' ( rotor ) which is very efficient for testing wide areas of the phase space of 2-d maps .    in the present paper",
    "we are introducing a new  mixed \" method , which we show that it is at least as sensitive as the other methods in the literature , may be applied in a straightforward way to dynamical systems with more than two degrees of freedom and is equally efficient for single trajectories as well as large sets of them .",
    "the method consists in analyzing a time series constructed by the values of the geodesic deviation of nearby trajectories recorded at a properly selected frequency .",
    "it should be noted that a method based on a similar technique has been proposed by lohinger and froeschl ( 1993 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the basic features of the method , which , in section 3 , is tested upon three dynamical systems of different types .",
    "a comparison of the results of our method to those derived by various other methods is made in section 4 .",
    "section 5 treats the application of the proposed method to one of the most important problems of solar system dynamics , the motion of asteroids .",
    "finally in section 6 we present our conclusions .",
    "an ordered trajectory of a n - d conservative dynamical system will lie on an invariant torus , i.e. a n - d manifold of the 2n - d phase space .",
    "any such trajectory is , in general , quasi - periodic and covers densely the invariant set . if a nearby trajectory is started at an infinitesimal distance from the previous one , this too would , in general , lie on an invariant torus , so that the @xmath10 time series should behave in a quasi - periodic manner . on the other hand , a chaotic trajectory visits different regions of phase space in a stochastic manner and @xmath10 should also be `` random '' .    following the above considerations we calculate the _ power spectrum _",
    "@xmath11 of the @xmath10 time series .",
    "we first calculate the discrete fourier transform of the @xmath12 multiplied by a _ window function _",
    "@xmath14 then the power spectrum , @xmath11 , is defined in @xmath15 frequencies as @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the nyquist frequency defined as @xmath19 the frequencies covered by the power spectrum are @xmath20 in the present work we used the so called `` hanning '' window .",
    "more details on the calculation of the power spectrum can be found in the book by press et .",
    "1992 ) .    0.1 cm    as a rule ",
    "mixed \" methods are expected to perform better in distinguishing between ordered and chaotic trajectories .",
    "the reason for that is that time series that are constructed from the geodesic divergence of nearby orbits contain all the various characteristic frequencies that locally affect the motion in the  proper \" ratio , i.e. the frequencies corresponding to the different directions ( degrees of freedom ) are properly weighted.in particular now , as far as our method is concerned , the power spectrum of divergences ( psod ) of an ordered trajectory is expected to posses only a few  spikes \" at specific frequencies .",
    "the number of harmonics however depends on the system under consideration as well as on the values of its `` controll '' parameters ( see below ) .",
    "in contrast , the psod of a chaotic trajectory should appear continuous , due to the random nature of the @xmath12 time series .",
    "however , the above considerations lie behind all methods based on time series analysis .",
    "what is really important , for the assessment of the new method with respect to the other ones appearing in the literature , is to evaluate ( a ) its independence from the number of degrees of freedom of the dynamical system , ( b ) its effectiveness with respect to the object of test ( single trajectories or distributions of initial conditions covering wide phase space regions ) ( c ) its sensitivity , i.e. the minimum length of the time series , necessary to distinguish a sticky chaotic trajectory from an ordered one and ( d ) its ability to produce a well - defined measure of chaos ( as is the lcn )",
    ".    0.1 cm",
    "we proceed in the assessment of the method using three different dynamical systems , namely a 2-d mapping as well as a 2-d and a 3-d hamiltonian system . in each one we evaluated the nature of a considerable number of trajectories . in the following subsections we present only three or four trajectories per system , which we think that are typical examples of the three different classes of trajectories , i.e. ordered , clearly chaotic and sticky .",
    "the amplitudes of the psod , in all figures , are normalized so that the highest has the value one , while the frequency is given in cycles per time unit .",
    "we first test the method in the simple 2-d mapping @xmath21 where the stochasticity parameter @xmath22 is taken equal to 0.7 .",
    "we present here the results of three trajectories , an ordered one ( _ map1 _ ) starting at @xmath23 , @xmath24 , a stochastic one ( _ map2 _ ) starting at @xmath23 , @xmath25 and a sticky one ( _ map3 _ ) starting at @xmath23 , @xmath26 .",
    "the initial conditions of the third one place it very close to the boundary between the ordered region , surrounding the stable point @xmath23 , @xmath27 , and the chaotic sea .",
    "figure [ map_invar ] shows the consequents ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) of the `` sticky '' trajectory at various times ( iterations ) .",
    "as we can see , for up to 2048 iterations the trajectory behaves like an ordered one .",
    "around @xmath30 it starts to present some signs of irregularity and finally , after @xmath31 , the chaotic nature of the trajectory becomes evident .",
    "using our method on these three trajectories , with the length of the @xmath12 time series being n=1024 iterations and defining @xmath32 , we obtain the spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ map_psod ] .",
    "the upper left frame of fig .",
    "[ map_psod ] is the spectrum of the ordered trajectory .",
    "the spectrum consists of some basic frequencies while the `` noise '' is at a very low level . on the contrary",
    ", the spectrum of the chaotic trajectory , in the upper right frame , covers the whole frequency range with comparable amplitudes , i.e. a clearly continuous spectrum .",
    "looking at the spectrum of the `` sticky '' trajectory ( lower left frame ) , we see a pattern almost the same as that of the chaotic one .",
    "some high - amplitude spikes are evident but the continuum noise level is again very high for the whole frequency range , denoting the stochastic nature of the trajectory . even with much less iterations ( n=256 - lower right frame of fig .",
    "[ map_psod ] ) we get the same result .",
    "the spectrum is less dense , since it has a smaller number of frequencies than before ( see eq.([eq_freqs ] ) ) , but the basic features are the same .",
    "note that for the lcn , which is the limit of the function @xmath33 as @xmath34 ( see fig .",
    "[ map_lcn ] ) , or the plot of the consequents of the mapping ( fig .",
    "[ map_invar ] ) , we need much more than 1024 iterations in order to decide whether the trajectory is chaotic or not .      0.1 cm    the above presented results show that it is , indeed , worth to consider the new method as a useful tool in the assessment of the nature , ordered or chaotic , of a trajectory .",
    "however the method , as it is , does not entail a _",
    "clear _ and _ easy to apply _ criterion for the classification of a trajectory as ordered or chaotic . here",
    "we try to improve somehow the presentation of the results of our method , in order to propose such a criterion .",
    "note that this new criterion is similar , graphically , to the criterion of the fli proposed by froeschl et al ( 1997 ) .",
    "if the peaks appearing in the psod are plotted in descending order of amplitude , we have a graphical representation of how many strong frequencies the spectrum possesses .",
    "figure  [ map_psod_sort ] shows this representation of the psod for the three trajectories studied in the previous sub - section .",
    "ordered trajectories have only a few high amplitude frequencies and the background is formed by peaks whose amplitudes are more than four orders of magnitude smaller than that of the basic frequency . on the other hand",
    "the stochastic trajectories possess only a few high - amplitude frequencies and the largest part of the spectrum consists of a `` continuum '' of frequencies with also considerable amplitude . in this respect",
    "one may chose to represent the results by a signle number ( e.g. the number of peaks up to a certain amplitude ) , provided that a certain `` threshold '' for the noise level is chosen ( 10@xmath35 in fig .",
    "this value will , however , depend on the system at study .",
    "0.1 cm 0.1 cm    any method of analysis of finite - sample time series is bound to suffer from noise .",
    "thus , even in the psod of a regular orbit a certain noise level is expected .",
    "this is mainly due to `` leakage '' of power from the frequency lobes , a side effect of the calculation of the power spectrum using discrete fast fourier transform methods . when calculating the power spectrum of a `` monochromatic '' signal , the power contained in its basic frequency `` leaks '' into neighboring frequencies .",
    "the leakage depends on the windowing function used . when a signal possesses two closely spaced frequencies ,",
    "all frequencies in between these two will also gain considerable amplitudes , due to this phenomenon .",
    "if the psod of a regular orbit has a large number of basic ( strong ) frequencies , then this effect can lead us to falsely identify it as chaotic .",
    "the problem can be tackled at the cost of taking more points in the sample . in this way",
    ", the number of frequencies appearing in the spectrum is increased but the frequency lobes become thinner . thus , lobe overlapping is reduced and the noise level drops . for chaotic orbits on the other hand , the observed noisy pattern is an inherent property of the spectrum and by increasing the number of points one can not alter the picture .",
    "the above can be seen in fig .",
    "[ noise1 ] , which shows the psod of a regular ( left column ) and a chaotic trajectory ( right column ) for three different values of n , i.e. n=256 ( top ) , n=4096 ( middle ) and n=65536 ( bottom ) .",
    "as we see , the noise level in the case of the regular orbit drops significantly when n is increased , while in the case of the chaotic orbit it remains more or less unchanged . in the n=65536 case the noise level for the ordered trajectory drops below @xmath36 , becoming comparable to the accuracy of the fft calculation ( double precision ) .",
    "this phenomenon is better seen if we use the amplitude - sorted psod .",
    "[ noise2 ] shows the amplitude - sorted psod of the regular ( left ) and chaotic ( right ) trajectory with n=256 , 1024 , 4096 , 16384 and 65536 .",
    "while the noise level in the psod of the ordered trajectory is reduced when n is increased , it remains the same for the chaotic one .",
    "0.1 cm    0.1 cm    0.1 cm    0.1 cm    we now proceed to test the method in a 2-d hamiltonian system .",
    "we selected the hamiltonian used by caranicolas & vozikis ( 1987 ) , @xmath37 where the parameter @xmath38 is taken equal to 2.0 and the energy constant @xmath39 .",
    "again we study three trajectories , one ordered ( _ ord-2 _ ) starting at @xmath40 , one clearly stochastic ( _ ch-2 _ ) starting at @xmath41 and one `` sticky '' ( _ st-2 _ ) which starts at @xmath42 .",
    "all three trajectories have also @xmath43 and @xmath44 , while their @xmath45 is given by the energy integral .    using the psod with a renormalization time - step equal to @xmath46 , we find that the spectra of the three test trajectories present the same properties as those of the corresponding cases of the mapping . in fig .",
    "[ 2d_a2_psod ] we see the psod of the three test trajectories .",
    "the difference between the spectrum of the chaotic trajectory _",
    "ch-2 _ and that of the ordered trajectory _",
    "ord-2 _ is again obvious .",
    "moreover , the `` sticky '' trajectory _",
    "st-2 _ has a spectrum similar to that of _ ch-2_. note that we have used only 2048 points ( corresponding to @xmath47 ) while , if we look at the evolution of the @xmath48 ( fig .",
    "[ 2d_a2_lcn ] ) , the trajectory looks ordered for a time up to @xmath49 .",
    "the fourth frame ( lower right ) in fig .",
    "[ 2d_a2_psod ] corresponds to another regular orbit ( _ ord-2a _ ) that starts at @xmath50 , i.e. very close to the sticky trajectory .",
    "we see that , although the two trajectories start very close to each other and , at least for the first 3000 times steps , span approximately the same phase - space region , their psods are completely different , clearly revealing the nature of each case .",
    "we decided to test also the case where the parameter @xmath38 is taken equal to @xmath51 .",
    "as caranicolas & vozikis ( 1987 ) have shown , the surface of section of this case has a completely different topology from that of the @xmath52 case .",
    "the equipotential curves have negative curvature along the @xmath53 lines .",
    "this affects mainly the loop orbits which appear `` squared '' .",
    "again we study four trajectories , one ordered ( _ ord-4 _ ) starting at @xmath54 , one clearly chaotic ( _ ch-4 _ ) starting at @xmath55 , one `` sticky '' ( _ st-4 _ ) which starts at @xmath56 and one ordered ( _ ord-4a _ ) starting at @xmath57 very near to the sticky one .",
    "the surface of section plot for the `` sticky '' trajectory is shown in fig .",
    "[ 2d_inv ] at various times .",
    "figures  [ 2d_psod ] and [ 2d_psod_sort ] present the psod and the amplitude - sorted psod for these four orbits ( n=4096 ) .",
    "an important characteristic seen in these two figures is the presence of a high number of medium - amplitude frequencies in the spectra of the regular orbits .",
    "however , a distinction between regular and chaotic orbits can still be made .",
    "due to frequency overlapping , discussed in section [ section_noise ] , individual frequencies can not be distinguished at an amplitude level smaller than @xmath58 .",
    "this makes it very difficult to identify a sticky orbit with an amplitude level around @xmath59 .",
    "nevertheless the noise level of the regular orbits will be supressed if we take more points , while for a sticky chaotic orbit it will remain more or less the same .",
    "we apply our method to the model hamiltonian used by magnenat ( 1982 ) , contopoulos & barbanis ( 1989 ) , barbanis and contopoulos ( 1995 ) , barbanis ( 1996 ) , varvoglis et al .",

    "one can not visualize a surface of section plot , in order to check whether a particular trajectory is ordered or chaotic .",
    "therefore , if one is using the traditional tools , he has to rely on the calculation of lcns .",
    "it should be pointed out that a positive lcn is a proof that the trajectory under study is chaotic , while a monotonically decreasing value of @xmath84 is not a proof of order , since this behavior could very well originate from  stickiness \" .",
    "that is why we decided to test one more trajectory ( _ reg00 _ ) for which we can be almost certain that it is ordered , as it has the same initial position as _ reg01 _ but it belongs to an almost integrable case of the model hamiltonian , @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "figure  [ 3d1 ] shows the calculation of the @xmath48 for the four trajectories .",
    "we can clearly see that @xmath87 of _ st-01 _ is decreasing up to @xmath88 and then begins to saturate to a non - zero lcn value .",
    "the stochasticity is even more evident after @xmath89 , where we have a `` jump '' to a higher lcn value .",

    "note once again that we can decide that the `` sticky '' trajectory _",
    "st-01 _ is actually stochastic well in advance of the lcn method .",
    "the lcn shows the stochastic behaviour of the trajectory only after @xmath93 , while with the psod we need a modest @xmath92 .    0.1 cm",
    "as we already mentioned in the introduction , three of the most recent methods for distinguishing ordered from chaotic trajectories are the fast lyapunov indicators ( fli ) ( froeschl et al . 1997 ) , the `` spectra '' of stretching numbers and/or twist angles ( froeschl et al . 1993 , voglis & contopoulos 1994 , contopoulos & voglis 1997 ) and the `` spectral distance '' ( dsd ) ( voglis et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 ) . out of these three methods",
    "the fastest ones are the fli and the dsd methods . in this section",
    "we compare the psod with the fli and the dsd methods by applying it to the test models presented in the above mentioned papers . a discussion concerning the spectra of stretching numbers follows .        in the paper by froeschl et al",
    "( 1997 ) the authors tested the fli method on two trajectories of the standard map @xmath94 with @xmath95 ; one stochastic starting at @xmath96 , @xmath97 and one ordered starting at @xmath98 , @xmath99 .",
    "they found that for the stochastic trajectory the fli s drop very quickly down to @xmath36 ( fig .  2 in their paper - 200 iterations ) .",

    "it should be pointed out , however , that , in order to obtain a well defined spectrum , one needs to account for a large number of iterations ( typically @xmath116 or more ) .",

    "the other two frames correspond to trajectories with initial @xmath128 , @xmath129 ( lower left ) and @xmath130 , @xmath129 ( lower right ) representing  clones \" of the asteroid 522 - helga , which is a well - known example of `` stable chaos '' ( milani & nobili 1992 ) .    the psod of the four trajectories ( n=512 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ 3bp - psod ] .",
    "as we can see , a few jovian periods are sufficient to decide if the motion of a particular asteroid is stochastic or ordered . in the case of the helga clone with @xmath128 ( lower left of fig .",
    "[ 3bp - psod ] ) the psod shows clearly a chaotic nature after only 512 jovian periods i.e. 6072 years , while even a rough calculation of the lcn needs at least @xmath131 years ( see lower right frame of fig .",
    "[ 3bp - lcn ] ) .",
    "the psod of the @xmath130 helga clone is rather peculiar .",
    "although it differs from that of the ordered orbit ( upper left ) , it is not clearly chaotic , unlike the psod of the other helga clone ( lower left ) .",
    "nevertheless , if we take more points in our time series the chaotic nature of the orbit becomes apparent , as we can see in fig .",
    "[ 3bp - psod2 ] .",
    "however , the spectrum can still be described as having a strong quasi - periodic component , something which is related to the peculiar dynamical nature of this orbit as discussed in tsiganis et al .",
    "( 2000b ) .",
    "in the present paper we propose an alternative tool , which we call psod , for the characterization of the chaotic or not nature of trajectories in conservative dynamical systems .",
    "the method is based on the frequency analysis of a time series , constructed by successive records of the amplitude of the deviation vector of nearby trajectories .",
    "as discussed in section 2 , such a  mixed \" method is expected to have certain advantages .",
    "the reason is that the power spectrum of such a time series will contain all the characteristic frequencies of the motion in a properly  weighted \" ratio .      * for ordered trajectories the spetrum possesses only a few high - amplitude peaks",
    ", the exact number of which depends not only on the system but also on the particular orbit .",
    "of course a small amplitude noise level , due to the numerical procedure , is superimposed on the spectrum , which diminishes as the length of the time series is increased ; * for chaotic trajectories the spectrum has a noisy pattern . for weakly chaotic orbits",
    "a few high - amplitude peaks are also present . increasing the length of the time series",
    ", the spectrum tends to a white noise spectrum which remains practically unchanged for any ( large enough ) number of points ( see figs . 5 and 6 ) .",
    "like most methods existing in the literature , it seems that the method performs better for maps than for flows .",
    "however , the results found for the three hamiltonian flows tested ( including the three - boody problem ) show that the method can be applied to any system , no matter how many degrees of freedom are involved .",
    "we believe that the results may be significantly improved for flows , provided that proper analysis concerning the renormalization time is conducted .",
    "the difference between maps and flows is that , in the former case , isochronous records of dynamical quantities also mean studying the system on a surface of section .",
    "this is not the case for flows and , thus , a more refined analysis on how to select a proper renormalization time has to be made .",
    "we have shown that the sensitivity of the psod in testing single trajectories in maps is comparable to the fli and the dsd methods .",
    "this also makes the psod an efficient tool for scanning wide areas of the phase space ( see section 4 ) . for such purposes one would like to have an one - number indicator for measuring chaos .",
    "the only uniquely defined measure of chaos is of course the lcn .",
    "any other indicator should be in a one - to - one correspondence with the lcn , in order to give the same information .",
    "there is no guarantee that such an indicator can be based on the frequency content of the psod , as chaotic orbits with similar lcns may have a different frequency distribution .",
    "further analysis of the properties of the psod has to be performed in order to decide whether such an indicator can be found .",
