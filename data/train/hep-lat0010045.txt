    "@xmath0 reduces as the lattice derivatives are improved , and lies between the value obtained by the alpha collaboration and the 1-loop tadpole - improved value .",
    "furthermore , consistent values for the bare quark mass at zero and finite momentum can only be obtained for derivatives correct to @xmath23 and above .",
    "these results suggest a similar study should be performed within the schrdinger functional approach . in the future , we plan to investigate the quark mass dependence of @xmath0 and check the scaling properties of the renormalised light quark mass and @xmath8 obtained using our values of @xmath0 .",
