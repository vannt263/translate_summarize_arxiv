    "gravitational lensing was first proposed by @xcite  a consequence of his theory of general relativity , it is the effect of a massive body warping space - time and bending light around it , acting as a lens .",
    "this produces two or more images of background objects distorted around the ` einstein ring ' , which can be thought of as a scale radius ( @xmath12 ) of the lens and depends on its mass , @xmath13 . the angular radius of the ring is given by : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the observer  lens and observer  source distances respectively . for objects of stellar mass ,",
    "this radius is below the resolution limit of our telescopes , and we observe the phenomenon of microlensing . in this case , we can not resolve multiple images of the source , but detect an increase in brightness as the individual amplifications combine to produce a brighter stellar image . as we observe a foreground ( lens )",
    "star passing in front of a background ( source ) star , we see an increase in brightness up to a maximum amplitude @xmath17 at the time @xmath18 of closest approach , followed by a decrease .",
    "this gives a symmetrical light curve around @xmath18 , providing the timescale for the event is short enough for parallax effects to be negligible .",
    "the timescale depends on the lens transverse velocity , relative to the observer - source line of sight , @xmath19 , and is given by the length of time it takes the source to cross the einstein ring of the lens : @xmath20    this depends on both mass and distances , through the dependence on @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath19 is also indirectly influenced by distance , as the positions within the galaxy of the source and lens stars will give them average motions based on the orbital velocity at their galactic radius . for",
    "a survey looking toward the galactic bulge ( i.e. @xmath21 kpc ) , a microlensing event due to a stellar mass ( @xmath22 ) lens will last a few weeks .",
    "a jupiter mass object will have @xmath23 1 day , while an earth would produce an effect which would be observable for only a few hours .",
    "if a stellar lens has a planetary companion , this will appear as a brief deviation from the stellar microlensing light curve , where the amplifications due to the star and planet combine @xcite .",
    "these deviations should be observable , even for low mass objects , and therefore provide a method to detect extra - solar planets which is potentially more sensitive to small planets than radial velocity searches , given a programme of intensive monitoring with data taken many times per hour .",
    "the main difficulty with using gravitational microlensing to search for exoplanets is the low probability that any given source star will be lensed .",
    "this can be overcome by a monitoring programme which studies dense star fields and can detect a flux increase in any of the stars in the field .",
    "the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) @xcite monitors @xmath24 150 million stars in the galactic bulge , and alerts the astronomical community via internet and e - mail alerts as soon as a lensing event is seen to begin .",
    "ogle began in its current form , ogle - iii , in 2001 . this version uses difference image analysis ( dia ) photometry @xcite , instead of the profile fitting ( psf ) method used for the previous three seasons .",
    "this has substantially increased the detection rate of stellar microlensing events by ogle  there were 167 events discovered during the three years of , compared to 389 recorded during the 2002 season with .",
    "we use ogle 2002 data to put firm upper limits on the population of planets in the bulge of our galaxy .",
    "our method follows that of @xcite , and is described in section [ lcf ] , before section [ 2002data ] looks at the results found for the 2002 data .",
    "the abundance of planets is discussed in section [ ptot ] .",
    "a point - source point - lens ( pspl ) model of microlensing can describe the light curve entirely based on four parameters ; @xmath18 and @xmath25 as defined in section [ intro ] , the baseline ( unlensed source ) magnitude @xmath26 , and the impact parameter @xmath27 .",

    "[ at ] , @xmath26 is the source star s baseline magnitude , and @xmath39 accounts for the additional flux from other stars that are blended with the source .",
    "this method produces reasonable fits to the microlensing peak , however it was often found that the residuals in the flat ( baseline ) parts of the curve were larger than the photometric errors @xmath34 reported for data points in this region .",
    "this was overcome by introducing a further fit parameter , @xmath40 , which scales the error bars .",
    "however this scaling often causes the error bars around the central peak to become much larger than the residuals , and would mask any interesting discrepancies .",
    "the scatter around the baseline can be explained by the fact that the fields observed are very densely populated , and so one further parameter was introduced : @xmath41 , the crowded field error .",
    "when @xmath42 and @xmath40 are used in conjunction they adjust the error bars to provide a much more accurate representation of the residuals . for @xmath42 and @xmath34",
    "expressed in magnitudes , the adjusted error bars are then given by : @xmath43 and the best fit is found by maximising the likelihood criterion @xmath44 , and is equivalent to minimising @xmath45    there is one more fit parameter which    plens    can adjust , the blending fraction @xmath39 .",
    "this describes the amount of the baseline flux that is due to light from non - lensed stars in the crowded fields studied .",
    "[ mn024 ] +      @xmath46 maps ( fig .",

    "this results in a plot of ` detection zones ' around each data point , where the addition of a planet to the model gives @xmath48 , where @xmath46 is the difference in @xmath32 between the binary and pspl models , and @xmath49 is a threshold value of @xmath46 .",
    "the plots show a white zone where the @xmath32 value is significantly increased , compared to a pspl fit , by the addition of a planet .",
    "this means that the presence of a planet in these zones can be ruled out ",
    "if there were a planet at that point , it would have significantly affected the data point at the centre of the zone .",
    "a black spot on the detection map would correspond to @xmath50 , implying that the planet model improves the fit from the pspl by a significant margin , which would be strong evidence for a planet .",

    "a monte - carlo method was used to produce data sets based on the ogle data , with new values for each point chosen within a gaussian distribution based on the stated error bars .",
