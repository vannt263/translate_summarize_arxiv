    "for example , fluorescence intensities , charge state ratios as well as timescales and spectral response of charge state dynamics differ greatly among different nv centers and nanodiamonds .",
    "the latter observation was attributed to electron tunneling and differing fermi levels among nanodiamonds in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in @xcite , a similar charge state switching mechanism was used to superresolve nv centers .",

    "microwave radiation for spin manipulation is guided via copper wires close to the nv centers .",
    "+ for confocal imaging a collimated beam is sent into an high na oil immersion objective and fluorescence light is collected by the same objective and finally focused onto a pinhole for spatial filtering and then onto a single photon counting avalanche photo diode ( apd , see fig .  [",
    "fig : setup ] ) . a 3d piezostage with nanometer precision is used to move the objective across the diamond sample .",
    "for ccd imaging the piezoscanner is fixed and additional lenses can be flipped into the beam path to focus the illumination laser onto the back focal plane of the objective which leads to wide - field illumination . in that case",
    "the fluorescence light is guided onto the pixel array of an electron multiplying ccd camera ( ixon ultra 897 , andor technology ) .",
    "the magnification is set such that @xmath50 nm in the focal plane corresponds to one pixel on the ccd ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : setup]_a _ ) .",
    "+ we use commercial cvd diamond samples of type iia which contain as grown and artificially created nv centers .",
    "for illumination with @xmath8=594@xmath49 nm light and intensities @xmath7 far below saturating levels , the nv center fluorescence level exhibits sudden jumps which can be attributed to charge state switching from nv@xmath0 to nv@xmath1 induced by two photon ionization ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : setup]_c _ ) @xcite . this behavior can be characterized and controlled as follows .",
    "the average `` on '' and `` off '' times , @xmath9 and @xmath51 , of fluorescence bursts and background fluorescence respectively are inversely proportional to @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "in addition , the fluorescence count rate @xmath54 during a burst is directly proportional to @xmath7 ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "consequently , the average number of photons per burst @xmath10 is proportional to the square - root of @xmath9 and inversely proportional to @xmath7 ( @xmath56 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : setup]_d _ ) .",
    "the ratio of @xmath9 and @xmath51 can be altered by tuning the illumination wavelength ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : setup]_d _ ) . for 594@xmath49 nm illumination light",
    "the @xmath9 fraction is @xmath57 , and it decreases for longer wavelengths .",
    "during storm imaging we continuously record ccd images at a constant rate while the `` on''-off-switching of fluorescence happens stochastically .",
    "this necessitates post processing of the data which is divided into two steps .",
    "first , we select frames with just a single active emitter by setting upper and lower thresholds for the photon number .",
    "thus we discard empty frames or those with two or more active emitters . in a second step we check for lateral asymmetries in the fitted psf of all remaining frames as an additional sign for more than one active emitter .",
    "+ for the remaining frames a 2d gaussian function is fitted to frame number @xmath23 which yields a center location @xmath58 $ ] , the number of photons @xmath22 and the width @xmath26 of the point spread function .",
    "please note that the gaussian function is just an approximation of the real point spread function ( psf ) @xcite .",
    "the width @xmath26 of the fitted psf allows to determine the relative axial location of the emitter with respect to the focal plane . in our case",
    "however all emitters are in the same focal plane .",
    "as the number of photons contributing to the center location is @xmath22 the expected standard deviation of that location should scale as @xmath27 .",
    "sensor pixelation and background noise , however , affect the standard deviation like @xcite @xmath59 where @xmath60=100@xmath49 nm is the pixel size of the images and @xmath61 accounts for background photons per pixel in dependence of exposure time @xmath62 . in our storm",
    "technique the average number of photons @xmath22 increases with the square - root of the burst length/ exposure time @xmath62 , where the burst length is altered by the illumination intensity .",

    "+ for on average @xmath66 photons per burst and average burst lengths of 4@xmath49s these location distributions are broader than what is expected from eq .",
    "( [ eq : pos_accuracy_thompson ] ) .",
    "this is due to sample drift during the accumulation of ccd frames which leads to additional broadening when all bursts are summed up according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : new_position ] ) .",
    "thus , the overall standard deviations of the emitter locations can be estimated as @xmath67 where we have evaluated the drift to be @xmath68 nm .",
    "+ as the achieved standard deviation @xmath69 nm is smaller than the average distance between the emitters we are able to recognize single distinct location distributions for individual nv centers .",
    "thus , we can compute the localization accuracy @xmath70 where we ideally gain an additional factor of @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the number of detected bursts for an individual nv center ( see fig.[fig : storm]_b _ ) . with an average number of bursts per nv of @xmath73 we achieve a localization accuracy of @xmath74=6@xmath49 . + the presented resolution in fig .",
    "[ fig : storm]_c _ was achieved under optimal conditions ( i.e. optimal laser intensity ) with respect to standard deviation @xmath75 of location distributions .",
    "the optimum of @xmath75 arises from an increase of @xmath76 for decreasing laser intensity ( i.e. increasing exposure time @xmath9 ) on the one hand and an increase in background noise @xmath77 on the other hand ( see eq .  [",

    "away from spin resonance the spin state is @xmath82 and accordingly a high rate of fluorescence photons is obtained . upon resonance conditions",
    "the levels @xmath81 become populated and the fluorescence decreases .",
    "although both nv centers are exposed to the same external magnetic field , by chance their symmetry axes lie along different directions of @xmath83 in the diamond lattice resulting in crystal fields with different directions @xcite .",
    "thus the vectorial sum of external and crystal field is different for both nv centers and thus are their odmr resonance lines .",

    "<S> we experimentally demonstrate precision addressing of single quantum emitters by combined optical microscopy and spin resonance techniques . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we utilize nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) color centers in diamond confined within a few ten nanometers as individually resolvable quantum systems . by developing a stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ( storm ) technique for nv centers we are able to simultaneously perform sub diffraction - limit imaging and optically detected spin resonance ( odmr ) measurements on nv spins . </S>",
    "<S> this allows the assignment of spin resonance spectra to individual nv center locations with nanometer scale resolution and thus further improves spatial discrimination . </S>",
    "<S> for example , we resolved formerly indistinguishable emitters by their spectra . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , odmr spectra contain metrology information allowing for sub diffraction - limit sensing of , for instance , magnetic or electric fields with inherently parallel data acquisition . as an example </S>",
    "<S> , we have detected nuclear spins with nanometer scale precision . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we give prospects of how this technique can evolve into a fully parallel quantum sensor for nanometer resolution imaging of delocalized quantum correlations . </S>"
