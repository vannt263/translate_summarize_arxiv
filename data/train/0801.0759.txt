    "here , we explain how the so - called `` structured '' target density profiles in our study were obtained . as discussed in the main text ,",

    "how can this relationship be understood ?    from the potential distribution theorem  @xcite , we have @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the probability of inserting an additional hard - sphere at position @xmath89 without overlapping a particle of the fluid . from this , it is clear that @xmath90 can not generally be satifisfied for finite @xmath28 . however , for our present purposes , we are not interested in finding states that strictly maximize excess entropy .",

    "<S> thermodynamic properties of the confined wca fluid subjected to a nonzero target @xmath10 were determined through canonical expanded ensemble simulations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a system with a flat or structured profile was related to that with a natural profile through a series of subensembles in which the target potential @xmath10 was scaled by a factor @xmath36 that spanned from 0.0 to 1.0 in increments of 0.001 . a transition matrix mc technique similar to that described in  @xcite </S>",

    "<S> the term @xmath43 dz$ ] is simply the change in entropy of an ideal gas upon changing its density profile from @xmath44 to @xmath45 .    </S>",
    "<S> we computed the transport coefficients of the thin films via molecular dynamics simulations in the microcanonical ensemble using @xmath46 particles and integrating the equations of motion with the velocity - verlet algorithm  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a time step of 0.0025 was used for simulating the natural and flat profile systems , while a shorter time step of 0.0002 was employed for the structured profile fluids . </S>",

    "<S> we extracted values of self - diffusivity ( parallel to the walls ) @xmath49 by fitting the long - time ( @xmath50 ) behavior of the mean - squared displacement to the einstein relation for diffusion @xmath51 , where @xmath52 corresponds to the mean - squared displacement in the @xmath47 and @xmath48 directions . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculated values of zero - shear viscosity @xmath53 using its corresponding einstein relation .    in order to systematically probe the effects of flattening or enhancing the layering of the density profile , we first focus on the behavior of the confined fluid for @xmath54 and @xmath26 . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig2_lambdavary ] , we show how these specific ways of modifying the density distribution in turn affect the entropy per particle @xmath69 , the excess entropy per particle @xmath70 , the self - diffusivity @xmath49 , and the viscosity @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , @xmath69 appears highest for the natural profile . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the system is virtually athermal when @xmath29 due to the steep boundary and interparticle repulsions . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , its equilibrium ( minimum free energy ) structure also approximately maximizes @xmath69 relative to other fluid states [ i.e. , other @xmath10 and corresponding density profiles ] with the same @xmath28 and @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the natural profile state does not , however , maximize @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> rather , @xmath70 is found to monotonically increase with increased `` structuring '' of the density profile . </S>",
    "<S> how can we understand these trends ?    the key is to recall that @xmath71 quantifies how changing @xmath36 and , in turn , the density profile modifies the ideal gas entropy , while @xmath72 measures the corresponding entropic change associated with the interacting fluid s interparticle correlations . with </S>",
    "<S> this is mind , it is clear that flattening the natural profile will inevitably result in an increase in ideal gas entropy [ i.e. , @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , since @xmath69 generally decreases upon flattening of the natural profile , it follows that @xmath70 will also generally decrease , reflecting an overall strengthening of interparticle correlations . in other words , paradoxically , the fluid with the flat density profile exhibits the highest degree of structural order .    on the other hand , it is also self - evident that enhancing the layering of the natural density profile will decrease the ideal gas entropy [ i.e. , @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath69 also decreases in this process , the aforementioned entropic penalty can at most be partially compensated by an increase in @xmath70 due to diminished interparticle correlations . in fact , </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2_lambdavary ] provides a specific example for how `` structuring '' the density profile can significantly decrease the overall structural order ( i.e. , increase @xmath70 ) of the confined fluid . </S>",
    "<S> one should keep in mind that the specific structured profiles examined here were selected precisely because density functional theory predicted that they would have high values of @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we emphasize that while flattening the natural density profile can generally be expected to decrease @xmath70 , alternative means for embellishing its structure at constant @xmath28 may either increase or decrease @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> the case studied here provides proof of concept for the former . we will extensively discuss the latter case in a future publication .    a second important point of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2_lambdavary ] is that the mobility of the confined fluid , as measured by both @xmath75 and @xmath49 , closely tracks the behavior of @xmath70 ( but not @xmath69 ) for the flattening and structuring processes described above . </S>",
    "<S> a physical explanation is that fluid transport parallel to the walls is dominated by interparticle collisions , and hence structural correlations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the density profile appears to impact these transport processes mostly due to the fact that it modifies the interparticle correlations , the effect of which is conveniently isolated by computing the excess rather than the total entropy of the fluid .    </S>",
    "<S> the above observation that fluids with more uniform density profiles can actually have lower @xmath70 and slower dynamics than those with strongly layered density profiles ( and the same @xmath28 ) appears even more general when viewed in the context of other recent simulation data . in particular , it is now known that the hard - sphere fluid confined between hard walls shows lower @xmath70  @xcite and slower single - particle dynamics both parallel  @xcite and normal  @xcite to the confining walls when such walls are separated by distances that inherently frustrate the ability of the fluid to structure into an integer number of layers in its density profile . </S>",
    "<S> these model predictions of the relationship between dynamics and density profiles can now also be readily tested in experiments , e.g. , by using confocal microsopy to investigate confined `` hard - sphere '' colloidal suspensions  @xcite .     </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) excess entropy per particle @xmath76 , ( b ) self - diffusivity @xmath49 , and ( c ) viscosity @xmath53 , of the confined wca fluid versus average density @xmath28 at @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> symbols are simulation data , and curves are guide to the eye . ]    finally , to document the generality of the physics discussed above , we show in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3_detaexs ] the behaviors of @xmath70 , @xmath53 , and @xmath49 over a broad range of average film densities . </S>",
    "<S> perhaps most striking is the observation that , at high density , fluids with structured and flat density profiles with the same @xmath28 can differ in both @xmath49 and @xmath53 by an order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> although the current study focuses on equilibrium fluid conditions , the trends evident in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3_detaexs ] suggest that one might even be able to effectively supercool monatomic confined fluids by isothermally modifying the external potential in a way that systematically flattens the density profile . </S>",
    "<S> finally , one can imagine extending these ideas to confined mixtures by using a species - dependent boundary potential to tune the partial molar entropies and dynamics of individual components . </S>",
