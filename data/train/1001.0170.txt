    "spreading of an infectious disease is a random process .",
    "an important source of the randomness is demographic noise associated with the stochastic character of the events of infection , recovery , birth , death , etc . in a large population demographic noise is small on average , and the infection spread leads to an endemic state where a certain fraction of the population stays infected for a long time .",
    "the disease , however , can disappear as a result of a large rare fluctuation , an unlikely chain of events where , for example , susceptible individuals happen to avoid getting infected while infected ones recover @xcite . then",
    ", if there is no influx of infected individuals from the outside , the population will be disease - free . such spontaneous disappearance of a disease is an example of population extinction studied in stochastic population dynamics .",
    "spontaneous extinction is also important for various physical and chemical reaction systems .",
    "this is a consequence of the underlying similarity of the dynamics that result from short random events , like collisions between molecules that lead to chemical reactions and interactions between individuals that lead to the disease spread .",
    "extinction can be understood for different types of systems within the same general formalism , which provides a broader scope for the present paper .",
    "moreover , the method of optimal control of extinction that we propose can be applied to systems of various types .",
    "a conventional way of fighting epidemics is via vaccination .",
    "if there is enough vaccine , the infection can be eradicated  deterministically \" by eliminating the endemic state @xcite .",
    "the amount of available vaccine , however , is often insufficient .",
    "the vaccine may be expensive , or it may be dangerous to store in large amounts , as in the case of anthrax , or it may be effectively short - lived due to mutations of the infection agent , as for hiv @xcite and influenza @xcite .    even where the endemic state may not be eliminated deterministically , vaccination can dramatically affect the stochastic dynamics of the epidemics .",
    "the underlying mechanism is the change of the rate of large fluctuations leading to disease extinction .",
    "for a well mixed population , this rate @xmath0 is usually exponentially small for a large total population size @xmath1 , @xmath2 with @xmath3 , @xcite .",
    "we call @xmath4 the disease extinction barrier .",
    "vaccination changes the value of @xmath5 . in turn , this changes the disease extinction rate exponentially strongly .",
    "this effect was previously discussed for vaccination applied at random @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to find an optimal way of administering a limited amount of vaccine which would maximally increase the disease extinction rate .",
    "we find a vaccination protocol that applies for a broad class of epidemic models .",
    "our approach is based on the observation that , in a large fluctuation that leads to disease extinction , the population is most likely to evolve in a well - defined way .",
    "it moves along the most probable path in the space of the dynamical variables which characterize different sub - populations @xcite .",
    "vaccination perturbs the system as it moves along the optimal path .",
    "one can think of vaccination as  force \" and its effect as ",
    "work \" done on the system .",
    "this work reduces the barrier @xmath4 .",
    "the problem then is to maximize the work for given constraints on the vaccine .",
    "optimization of the effect of vaccination resembles another problem of optimal control of random systems : controlling large fluctuations in noise - driven dynamical systems by applying an external field with a given average intensity @xcite .",
    "there are , however , important differences , which come from the very nature of the control field . indeed , vaccination only _",
    "reduces _ the number of susceptible individuals . in other words , as a control field , vaccination never changes sign .",
    "then , as we find , if the available amount of vaccine is constrained by a given mean vaccination rate , the optimal vaccination protocol turns out to be model - independent .",
    "this applies also to using a limited amount of medications and other situations where the control field drives the system only in one direction .",
    "we assume that vaccination is applied periodically in time . in this case ,",
    "the optimal protocol is to apply the vaccine as a sequence of @xmath6-like pulses .",
    "the disease extinction rate can strongly depend on the period of this sequence .",
    "furthermore , the extinction rate can display exponentially sharp peaks when the pulse sequence period is close to the characteristic period of oscillations of the system in the absence of fluctuations , or to its multiples .",
    "we illustrate this resonant phenomenon for the susceptible - vaccinated - infected - recovered ( svir ) model .",
    "epidemics often display seasonal modulation @xcite .",
    "it is natural to apply a vaccine with period equal to the modulation period . as we show",
    ", there is a qualitative difference between the effect of a periodic vaccination in this case and in the case where seasonal modulation is absent . for",
    "a system with seasonal modulation , an improperly applied pulsed vaccination can actually _ reduce _ the disease extinction rate and therefore prolong the duration of the epidemic .",
    "the overall effect of the pulsed vaccination critically depends here on the _ phase _ at which the periodic pulses are applied .",
    "the analysis of periodic vaccination , with and without seasonal variations , necessitates a general formulation of the extinction problem in periodically modulated stochastic populations .",
    "we extend the previous results for single - population systems @xcite to provide a complete extinction theory for multi - population systems in the eikonal approximation , and emphasize the distinction from the well - understood problem of switching between metastable states in periodically modulated systems with noise @xcite .",
    "section ii describes the class of epidemic models we consider in this work and develops an eikonal theory of disease extinction rate in periodically modulated systems .",
    "section iii formulates the optimization problem for vaccination and presents its solution for a time - periodic vaccination in the limit of a small average vaccination rate . in section",
    "iv we discuss the vaccination - induced reduction of the disease extinction barrier for two types of constraints on the vaccination period , a limited lifetime of the vaccine and a limited vaccine accumulation .",
    "section v illustrates , on the example of the stochastic svir model , the phenomenon of resonant response to vaccination .",
    "section v contains concluding remarks .",

    "( [ eq : master_master ] ) if the width of the probability distribution @xmath13 is set equal to zero .",
    "we start with the case where the transition rates @xmath23 are independent of time .",
    "an endemic state , where a finite fraction of population is infected for a long time , corresponds to an attracting fixed point @xmath24 of the dynamical system , eq .",
    "( [ eq : mean_field ] ) .",
    "we will assume throughout this work that there is only one such point .",
    "we will also assume that eq .",
    "( [ eq : mean_field ] ) has one fixed point @xmath25 in the hyperplane @xmath26 .",
    "the state @xmath25 is stable with respect to all variables except @xmath27 .",
    "we call it the disease extinction state . if @xmath28 ( there is a nonzero number of infected ) , the deterministic trajectory leaves the vicinity of @xmath25 and approaches the endemic state @xmath24 .    due to demographic noise",
    "the endemic state is actually _",
    "metastable_. a rare large fluctuation ultimately drives the population into a disease - free state .",
    "the most probable fluctuation brings the system to the fixed point @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the probability of such a fluctuation per unit time , _",
    "i.e. _ , the disease extinction rate @xmath0 , is given by the probability current to @xmath25 , similarly to the problem of escape from a metastable state @xcite .",
    "for time - independent @xmath23 this current is quasistationary for times @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the characteristic relaxation time for the noise - free motion described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : mean_field ] ) .",
    "we note that , even though the state @xmath25 is a saddle point in the mean - field approximation , it differs from the saddle - point states encountered in the problem of switching between metastable states of reaction systems . in the case of interstate switching ,",
    "the rates of elementary transitions @xmath23 in the unstable direction are nonzero , and ultimately fluctuations drive the system away from the saddle point . in the case of extinction ,",
    "fluctuations around @xmath25 occur only in the extinction hyperplane , whereas the probability of exiting this hyperplane is zero .",
    "if the system has , in the mean - field approximation , more than one steady state away from the extinction hyperplane , extinction can go in steps : from the endemic state to another steady state and , ultimately to the extinction hyperplane .",
    "in particular , if the only additional steady state is a saddle point at the boundary between the basins of attraction of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , the problem of extinction can be reduced to the problem of escape over this saddle point @xcite .",
    "the above picture can be extended to the case where the transition rates are periodic functions of time , @xmath31 .",
