    "absolute distances of rr lyrae stars play a fundamental role in stellar astrophysics , and the reasons are manifold .",
    "they are widely adopted to establish the absolute age of globular clusters ( gcs ) and to properly compare predicted and empirical color - magnitude diagrams .",
    "moreover , they are robust stellar tracers of low - mass , old populations and are ubiquitous across the galactic spheroid as well as in local group galaxies . during the last few years",
    "a paramount theoretical and observational effort has been devoted to the rr lyrae distance scale to improve not only the intrinsic accuracy but also to constrain the occurrence of deceptive systematic errors ( caputo et al .",
    "2000 ; walker 2000 ; bono 2003 ; cacciari & clementini 2003 ) .    in a series of previous papers ( bono et al .",
    "2001,2002,2003 , hereinafter b01 , b02 , and b03 ) we have drawn the attention to the @xmath3-band period - luminosity - metallicity ( @xmath4 ) relation of rr lyrae stars .",
    "this relation was originally discovered by longmore et al .",
    "( 1990 , hereinafter l90 ) and presents several undisputable advantages when compared with other methods available in the literature . in particular , the @xmath4 relation is only marginally affected by evolutionary effects as well as by a spread in stellar mass inside the instability strip .",
    "moreover , it is only weakly affected by uncertainties in the reddening correction and shows a linear trend when moving from metal - poor to metal - rich objects .",
    "current theoretical predictions appear in very good agreement with empirical observations , and indeed the pulsation parallax to rr lyr itself estimated by b02 , is in very good agreement with the trigonometric parallax measured by benedict et al .",
    "( 2002 ) with the fine guide sensor on board the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "although the theoretical framework concerning the @xmath4 relation has been thoroughly discussed , only a few investigations have been devoted to near - infrared ( nir ) observations of cluster and field rr lyrae stars .",
    "in fact , with the exception of the @xmath3-band data collected by l90 for cluster rr lyrae and baade - wesselink rr lyrae ( see b03 for a detailed list ) only one investigation has been devoted to rr lyrae stars in the galactic bulge ( carney et al .",
    "the observational scenario has been recently complemented with new @xmath3-band data collected by butler ( 2003 ) , using the adaptive optics camera available on the 3.5 m calar alto telescope , for a small sample of rr lyrae stars located in the very center of the gc m3 .",
    "the above discussion shows quite clearly that we lack new and accurate nir data to supply a sound empirical estimate of both the slope and the zero - point of the @xmath4 relation but also to improve current empirical constraints on the metallicity dependence . to fill this gap we undertook an observational project aimed at providing a comprehensive observational investigation of cluster and field rr lyrae stars in the nir @xmath0 and @xmath1-bands .    in this investigation we present @xmath3-band data for rr lyrae stars in the lmc cluster reticulum .",
    "we selected this cluster for the following reasons : it presents a sizable sample of well - studied rr lyrae stars ( 32 , walker 1992 ) , its central density is very low ( @xmath6 , peterson & kunkel 1977 ) , and therefore the nir photometry is not seriously affected by crowding , and the metal content of this cluster has been estimated using medium resolution spectra ( @xmath7\\approx=-1.71\\pm0.1 $ ] , suntzeff et al .",
    "1992 ) . in section 2",
    ", we present the observations and the fit to the @xmath1-band light curves , while in section 3 we discuss the new distance determination together with intrinsic and systematic uncertainties affecting the current estimate .",
    "near - infrared @xmath0 and @xmath1 images of reticulum were collected in three different runs from december 1999 to february 2002 with sofi available at ntt eso la silla .",
    "the seeing conditions during these observing runs were good and range from 0.5 to 1.3 arcsec .",
    "we collected 46 @xmath0 and 171 @xmath1-band frames ( @xmath2 arcmin , pixel size=0.292 arcsec ) centered on the cluster and the individual exposure times range for the @xmath0-band from 10 to 30 s and for the @xmath1-band from 10 to 120 s. we detected 30 out the 32 rr lyrae stars present in this cluster , and the number of phase points for each object is approximately 12 .",
    "raw frames were pre - reduced using standard iraf procedures . to improve the photometric accuracy along the light curves we performed several tests using different techniques to stack the images , different criteria to select psf stars across the individual frames as well as different strategies to perform the photometry over the entire data set .",
    "we found that the best intrinsic accuracy can be achieved if we do not stack the images .",
    "we selected a reasonable number of psf stars ( @xmath825 ) for each frame and adopted a variable psf .",
    "moreover , the nir ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) frames have been simultaneously reduced with daophot / allframe together with a few v - band images to improve the accuracy of individual measurements and the limiting magnitudes .",
    "optical ( u , b , v , i ) data have been collected during the same observing runs , with susi2 available at the same telescope .",
    "a detailed description of observing and data reduction strategies will be discussed in a companion paper .",
    "the absolute photometric calibration of @xmath0 and @xmath1 eso magnitudes into the lco system was performed using the standard star 9109 ( hst s055-d ) measured by persson et al .",
    "we did not apply any correction to transform the @xmath1 into the @xmath3-band , due to the marginal difference ( lidman et al .",
    "this star was measured 10 times at air masses that bracket the observations on reticulum and the accuracy of the calibration is of the order of 0.002 mag in the @xmath3-band .",
    "figure 1 , shows the color - magnitude diagrams in the j , v - j ( top ) and @xmath3 , @xmath9 ( middle ) , and @xmath10 , @xmath11 ( bottom ) bands together with the intrinsic photometric accuracy on the mean magnitudes provided by allframe .",
    "data plotted in this diagram show quite clearly that the intrinsic accuracy for typical rr lyrae luminosities reaches 0.01 at @xmath12 and 0.015 at @xmath13 .",
    "we detected approximately 850 and 550 stars in @xmath0 and @xmath3-band , while the limiting magnitudes are @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "note that the sample of hot stars located at @xmath16 and @xmath17 are blue straggler stars as supported by the cross - identification with the optical cmd ( see open circles ) .",
    "this suggests that current photometry almost approaches the turn - off region .    to further improve the intrinsic accuracy of the rr lyrae mean magnitudes we decided to perform a fit of the individual phase points measured by allframe with a template curve",
    "this approach allows us a better propagation of individual errors on the final mean magnitude and avoids the spurious fluctuations introduced by the binning of phase points .",
    "jones et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have developed a template fitting technique for determining mean magnitudes in the @xmath3-band for rr lyrae stars from few phase observations .",
    "they have determined five different template shapes depending on the type of variability ( or type ) and on the @xmath18-amplitude of the variable and described each of these templates with a fourier series .",
    "we have adopted their method and for each star we computed the corresponding fourier template based on the ephemerides and the @xmath18-amplitudes from ripepi et al .",
    "( 2003 , in preparation ) .",
    "the candidate stars have been treated as variables , due to their small amplitudes and relatively short periods .    for each observed phase point",
    "we can compute the best estimate of the mean magnitude over phase of the variable by subtracting the template magnitude from the observed magnitude , @xmath19 .",
    "we computed the weighted intensity averaged magnitude over all the observed phase points for each variable star .",
    "the resulting mean magnitudes and their associated intrinsic errors are listed in table 1 .",
    "figure 2 shows the mean @xmath20 magnitude as a function of @xmath21 .",
    "note that the period of variables ( open circles ) in figure 2 have been fundamentalized , i.e. @xmath22 .",
    "it can be seen that there is an excellent correlation .",
    "linear regression gives :    @xmath23    with a standard deviation of only 0.03  mag .",
    "this is a remarkable result for a standard candle .",
    "based on the mean @xmath3-magnitudes from the previous section we now proceed to determine the distance to the reticulum cluster . to further improve the theoretical calibration of the @xmath4 relation , b03 devised a new pulsation approach that relies on mean @xmath3-band magnitudes and @xmath9 colors . in particular , they derived new @xmath4 relations ( see their relations 3 and 4 ) and period - luminosity - color - metallicity , @xmath24 , relations ( see their relations 7 and 8) that include the luminosity term .",
    "note that these relations when compared with theoretical predictions by b01 present three main advantages : _",
    "i ) _ they rely on a larger set of pulsation models ; _ ii ) _ independent theoretical relations have been derived for fundamental and first overtone pulsators ; _ iii ) _ the new @xmath4 and @xmath24 relations were derived by adopting predicted mass values for each assumed chemical composition , while b01 adopted an ensemble average .",
    "to root the calibration of the zero - point as well as of the coefficient of the metallicity term of the new @xmath4 relation on empirical data , b03 adopted a sample of field rr lyrae stars for which good @xmath10 and @xmath3-band light curves , accurate reddening corrections , and metal abundances were available in the literature . for fundamental mode pulsators they found :      suntzeff et al .",
    "( 1992 ) have determined the metallicity of the reticulum cluster to be @xmath26}\\,}=-1.71\\pm0.1 $ ] based on spectroscopy of the calcium ii triplet at around 860  nm for 9 individual stars in the cluster . entering this value in equation 2",
    "we can determine the distance modulus , @xmath27 , to each star .",
    "forming the weighted average of these estimates we find for the stars a value of @xmath28 , while for the stars , using the fundamentalized periods , we find @xmath29 and for the complete sample we find @xmath30 .    the reddening towards reticulum has been determined by walker ( 1992 ) who finds a very low value of @xmath31 .",
    "we combine this value with the reddening law from cardelli , mathis , & clayton ( 1989 ) of @xmath32 which gives a minuscule absorption in the @xmath3-band of @xmath33  mag . correcting the modulus for the reddening",
    "we find a best estimate of @xmath34 , where the error estimate only consider intrinsic random errors .",
    "the referee suggested to perform a detailed check of the systematic uncertainties affecting distance estimates based on the semi - empirical relation derived by b03 . to accomplish this goal we selected the galactic globular clusters ( ggcs ) for which are available both optical and nir mean magnitudes . to avoid subtle uncertainties in the reddening corrections we only selected ggcs with reddening corrections smaller than 0.2 .",
    "we ended up with four ggcs whose metallicity ranges from @xmath7=-1.27 $ ] ( m  5 ) to @xmath7=-2.26 $ ] ( m  15 ) . to estimate the difference in the distance moduli we adopted distances based on the baade - wesselink ( bw ) calibration provided by fernley ( 1994 ) as well as on the first overtone blue edge ( fobe ) provided by caputo et al .",
    "data listed in the last two columns of table 2 show that the difference ranges from @xmath35 for the less metal - poor cluster ( m  15 ) to @xmath36 for the more metal - rich cluster ( m  5 ) .",
    "this finding further strengthens the result obtained by b03 , i.e. the difference between distances based on @xmath4 and on the bw method depend on the mean metallicity and it decreases in the metal - rich regime ( see figures 6 and 8 in b03 ) .",
    "unfortunately , we still lack accurate mean k - band magnitudes for rr lyrae stars in a larger sample of metal - rich ggcs . moreover , current uncertainties affecting distance moduli based on mean v - band magnitudes are systematically larger than 0.1 mag .",
    "this hampers any precise quantitative conclusion on the systematic uncertainty affecting the @xmath4 distance scale .",
    "it is noteworthy , that cluster distances presented here appear to be systematically larger than distances based on the fobe method and on the @xmath4 calibration based on theoretical models provided by b01 .",
    "the semi - empirical calibration by b03 presents a steeper dependence on the metallicity ( 0.231 vs 0.167 ) and the reasons for the difference between the empirical and theoretical scales are not clear yet ( see also carney et al .",
    "finally , we note that the current distance estimate to @xmath37 cen is also 0.1 mag larger than the distance modulus derived by thompson et al .",
    "( 2001 ) on the basis of the eclipsing binary ogle17 .",
    "although , the analysis of current uncertainties affecting the rr lyrae distance is far from being definitive we decided to adopt a systematic uncertainty of 0.1 in the calibration of the zero - point .",
    "the uncertainty on the reddening correction is quite negligible , but we have to account for the uncertainty in the metallicity and in the metallicity scale .",
    "equation 2 was derived using the metallicity estimates provided by fernley et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and by zinn ( 1985 ) for field and cluster rr lyrae stars .",
    "the metallicities of field rr lyrae rely on a calibration of the @xmath38 method provided by fernley & barnes ( 1997 ) , i.e. @xmath7=-0.13 - 0.195 \\delta s$ ] , that is quite similar to the calibration provided by clementini et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , @xmath7=-0.08 - 0.195 \\delta s$ ] .",
    "these calibrations supply metal abundances quite similar to the zinn & west ( 1984 ) metallicity scale . on the other hand , gratton ( 1999 ) provided a new calibration , @xmath7=-0.03 - 0.176 \\delta s$ ] , that relies on the carretta & gratton ( 1997 ) metallicity scale . by accounting for these empirical uncertainties on the zero - point",
    ", on the slope as well as on the systematic uncertainties affecting the metallicity scale ( rutledge , hesser , & stetson 1997 ; kraft , & ivans 2003 ) we estimate the uncertainty on the metallicity to be of the order of 0.25 dex .",
    "this means that the uncertainty on the mean metallicity in equation 2 as well as in the cluster metallicity introduces an uncertainty of the order of 0.06 mag in the current distance determination .",
    "therefore , we end up with a distance to reticulum of @xmath39 .",
    "reticulum is located 11 degrees away from the center of lmc , and therefore we can only supply weak constraints on the absolute distance to lmc itself . according to our optical photometry and by assuming a mean reddening of @xmath31 ( walker 1992 ) the mean visual magnitude of rr lyrae stars in reticulum is : @xmath40 mag .",
    "note that this estimate is in very good agreement with the estimate provided by walker ( 1992 ) , i.e. @xmath41 .",
    "recent estimates of the mean visual magnitude of rr lyrae stars in the lmc bar range from @xmath42 ( 108 stars ) by clementini et al .",
    "( 2003 ) to @xmath43 ( 7110 stars ) derived by the ogle team ( soszynski et al . 2003 ) and to @xmath44 ( 80 first overtones ) derived by the macho team ( alcock et al .",
    "the key differences in these estimates are : statistics , absolute zero - point calibration , and reddening correction .",
    "it goes without saying that according to these estimates the position of reticulum ranges from @xmath45 kpc in front of lmc to @xmath46 kpc beyond lmc .",
    "new and homogeneous nir data for a sizable sample of rr lyrae in the lmc bar are mandatory to settle the uncertainty on the relative position of this cluster .",
    "the empirical evidence brought out by current data suggests that the @xmath4 relation is characterized by a global accuracy better than 0.12 mag .",
    "note that the current discrepancy between hb evolutionary models constructed by adopting different assumptions concerning the input physics is of the order of 0.1 - 0.15 mag ( cassisi et al .",
    "1999 ; vandenberg et al .",
    "however , the most recent systematic survey of @xmath3-band data for cluster rr lyrae stars dates back to l90 .",
    "therefore new and homogeneous nir data for ggcs with sizable samples of rr lyrae stars are strongly required to shed new lights on this _ vexata questio_. at the same time , a new empirical calibration of the @xmath4 relation based on rr lyrae stars for which heavy - element abundances has been measured on high - resolution spectra is also necessary .",
    "the intrinsic accuracy of the @xmath4 relation seems also very promising in providing a new distance scale for gcs that can allow us to improve their absolute age estimate .",
    "it is noteworthy that new cluster data will allow us to derive an independent @xmath4 relation for first overtone rr lyrae stars , and in turn to further improve the intrinsic accuracy of this method . finally , due to the marginal dependency on reddening corrections it could also be soundly adopted to derive the 3d - structure not only of the magellanic clouds , but also of the galactic bulge .",

    "<S> current data allowed us to derive accurate mean @xmath3-band magnitudes for 21 fundamental ( ) and 9 first overtone ( ) rr lyrae stars . on the basis of the semi - empirical @xmath3-band period - luminosity - metallicity ( @xmath4 ) relation we have recently derived , we find that the absolute distance to this cluster is @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the current error budget is dominated by systematic uncertainty affecting the absolute zero - point calibration and the metallicity scale . </S>"
