    "when a gas of neutral atoms or molecules is exposed to a strong electrical field , a small initial seed of electrons can lead to an ionization avalanche .",
    "indeed , the seed electrons are accelerated by the field and gain enough energy to ionize the neutral atoms when they collide .",
    "the two slow electrons that emerge from this reaction , i.e. the impact and the ionized electron , are again accelerated by the field and cause , on their turn , an ionization reaction .",
    "simultaneously the electrical field is locally modified because of the charge creation .",
    "this interplay between the dynamics of the electrons and the electrical field can lead to a multitude of phenomena studied in plasma physics such as arcs , glows , sparks and streamers .    in this article",
    "we will focus on the initial field driven ionization that can lead to traveling waves known as streamer fronts .",
    "these waves have previously been studied by ebert _",
    "@xcite who introduced and analyzed the minimal streamer model , a one - dimensional model for the propagation of planar streamer fronts .",
    "this model consists of two coupled non - linear pdes : a reaction - convection - diffusion equation for the evolution of the electron density and a poisson - like evolution equation for the electrical field .",
    "the reaction term is based on the townsend approximation that expresses the growth of the number of electrons as a function of the local electrical field .    during the last two decades ,",
    "however , a lot of progress has been made in the microscopic understanding of impact ionization reactions in atomic and molecular systems . in this reaction",
    "an impact electron ionizes the target and kicks out an additional electron .",
    "there are several successful theories that can predict the exact probability distribution of the escaping electron @xcite . in the next decade",
    ", we expect that the theoretical tools will be able to accurately predict the microscopic physics of electron impact on molecular targets such as n@xmath0 and o@xmath0 , the most important molecules in the composition of air .",
    "this progress in the understanding of the impact ionization reaction , however , has not been incorporated in the description of the macroscopic behavior such as the minimal streamer front of ebert _",
    "et al_. instead , such models still make use of a phenomenological approximation to the reactions , such as the townsend approximation .",
    "this article extends the minimal streamer model and incorporates more microscopic information .",
    "we model the system by a boltzmann equation , which is constructed such that the cross sections in the collision integral resemble the true microscopic cross sections .    to find the traveling wave solutions of this more microscopic model , we exploit a separation of time scales between the relaxation of the electron distribution function to a local equilibrium and the evolution of the macroscopic fields ( electron density and electrical field ) .",
    "it is known from kinetic theory that the first process is fast : once initialized , it takes a molecular gas not more than a few collisions to relax to its equilibrium state .    in kinetic theory ,",
    "the fast times scales are often eliminated from the problem by assuming a local equilibrium distribution function which leads to a reaction - diffusion model with transport coefficients that depend on the local electrical field .",
    "this reduction method , however , is only successful in the absence of steep gradients in the electron density @xcite , an assumption not valid for the planar streamer fronts that have , typically , very steep increases in the electron density .    in this article",
    ", we take an alternative route and find the traveling wave solution through a so - called _ coarse - grained time - stepper _ ( cgts ) that exploits the separation of time scales to extract the effective macroscopic behavior .",
    "this method was proposed by kevrekidis _",
    "_ @xcite and the numerical aspects of its application to find traveling wave solutions of lattice boltzmann models have recently been studied @xcite .",
    "the time - stepper uses a sequence of computational steps to evolve the macroscopic state .",
    "this sequence involves : ( 1 ) a lifting step , which creates an appropriate electron distribution function for a given electron density , ( 2 ) a simulation step , where the lattice boltzmann model is evolved over a coarse - grained time step @xmath1 , and ( 3 ) a restriction step , where the macroscopic state is extracted from the electron distribution function .",
    "this method does not derive effective equations explicitly , and therefore allows steep gradients to be present .",
    "we compare our results with those obtained by deriving an approximate macroscopic pde model through the more traditional chapman - enskog expansion .",
    "the paper therefore illustrates the applicability of the coarse - grained time - stepper on a non - trivial problem where the exact macroscopic equations are hard to derive .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we shortly review the physics of the impact ionization reaction and the streamer fronts , and recapitulate the boltzmann equations . in section iii ,",
    "we derive from the boltzmann equation a lattice boltzmann model with multiple velocities and discuss how the ionization reaction , external field and electron diffusion are incorporated in the model .",
    "section iv derives a macroscopic pde from the model using the chapman - enskog expansion and discusses the minimal velocity of the traveling waves .",
    "section v formulates the coarse - grained time - stepper and vi how the traveling wave solutions are found . finally in section vii",
    ", we have some numerical results .",
    "the impact ionization reaction is a microscopic reaction where electrons with , typically , an energy around 50ev collide with an atom or a molecule and ionize this target .",
    "the reaction rates of this process depend sensitively on a number of parameters .",
    "let us consider the simplest system : an electron hits a hydrogen atom with a bound electron in its ground state .",
    "when the incoming electron has an energy larger than the binding energy of the electron in the atom , it can kick out , with a certain probability , the bound electron that will escape , together with the impact electron , from the atom .",
    "the total energy of the two electrons after the collision is equal to the energy of the incoming electron minus the original binding energy of the bound electron .    the reaction rates of this process are expressed by cross sections ; these are probabilities that a certain event will take place .",
    "one such cross section is the triple differential cross section , which is the probability to find after the collision one electron escaping in the direction @xmath2 with an energy @xmath3 and a second electron escaping in the direction @xmath4 with an energy @xmath5 , where the angles are measured with respect to the axis defined by the momentum of the incoming electron .",
    "since the two electrons repel each other , it is more likely that they escape in opposite directions @xcite .    when this cross section is integrated over all angles @xmath2 and @xmath4 of the escaping electrons and all possible ratios of @xmath6 of the electron energies , we get the _ total cross section . _ this is the total probability that the incoming electron will cause an ionization event .",
    "this total cross section depends on the energy of the incoming electron and is zero when the energy of the incoming electron is below the binding energy of the bound electron . just above this binding energy",
    ", there is a steep rise in the cross section that is known as a threshold . just above this threshold",
    "the cross section is the largest and as we further increase the energy the cross section diminishes .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : cross_section ] ( top ) .    when the cross section is integrated of the angles only , but not over the relative energies , we get the so called _ energy differential cross section , _ which is the probability of causing an ionization event with a given relative energy of the two electrons . in contrast with the electron directions , there is no pronounced preference for the energy sharing between the two electrons , see figure [ fig : cross_section ] ( bottom ) .",
    "it is only slightly more likely that two electrons will come out with unequal energy .",
    "recently , several theoretical methods have successfully predicted the directions of the escaping electrons , the total cross section and the energy differential cross section in the hydrogen atom .",
    "we name _ exterior complex scaling _",
    "@xcite , _ time dependent close coupling _",
    "@xcite , _ hrw - sow _ @xcite and _ convergent close coupling _ @xcite .    when the electron hits a molecular system instead of an atom , the physics is complicated by the extra degrees of freedom .",
    "the cross sections now depend on both the orientation and internuclear coordinates of the molecule at the moment of electron impact , as is seen in processes where two electrons are ejected from molecules after it is hit by a photon @xcite .",
    "therefore , there will be some random terms in the reaction cross section , which will need to be included in a realistic microscopic model . in this paper , we will model the microscopic interactions using a boltzmann equation , which is still deterministic ; extensions that accurately account for random effects will be treated in future work .",
    "however , we note that the coarse - grained time - stepper approach that is used in this work has already been applied successfully to study systems with stochastic effects @xcite .",
    "ebert _ et al . _",
    "@xcite introduced the minimal streamer model .",
    "it consists of two coupled non - linear pdes : a reaction - convection - diffusion equation for the evolution of the electron density and an equation that relates the change in the electrical field to the charge flux .",
    "the electron density evolves because of the drift due to the electrical field , the electron diffusion and the ionization reaction , which is formulated in the townsend approximation .",
    "the reaction rate is then given by an exponential that depends on the strength of the local electrical field .",
    "the evolution of the electrical field is determined by poisson s law of electrostatics where the field changes because of the charge creation by the ionization reaction .",
    "this minimal streamer model exhibits both negatively and positively charged fronts .",
    "the first moves in the direction of the electrical field , while the positively charged moves in the opposite direction and can only propagate because of the electron diffusion and the ionization reactions .",
    "each of these fronts appears as a one - parameter family of uniformly translating solutions ( since any translate of the wave is also a solution ) .    in our extension of the ebert model ,",
    "we replace the reaction - diffusion equation for the evolution of the electron density with a boltzmann equation for the one - electron distribution function @xmath7 , that counts the number of electrons in the phase - space volume element bounded by position @xmath8 and @xmath9 and by speed @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the boltzmann equation is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the external electrical field and @xmath14 is the collision operator , an integral operator that integrates the cross sections of the ionization reaction over the velocity space .",
    "this boltzmann equation is coupled to an evolution equation for the electrical field . because additional electrons are created",
    ", the local charge density changes the electrical field through the poisson law @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the charge distribution . here",
    ", @xmath17 represents the number of ions , @xmath18 is the number of electrons and @xmath19 a unit of charge .",
    "we now connect the change in electrical field with the change in the charge distribution .",
    "we have @xmath20 in which @xmath21 is the charge flux .",
    "this leads to an equation for the evolution of the electrical field , @xmath22 since we assume that the ions are immobile , the flux @xmath21 is solely determined by the one - particle distribution function @xmath7 of the electrons .",
    "our extension of the minimal streamer model is now the coupled evolution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : boltzmann ] ) and ( [ eq : electrical_field ] ) .",
    "note that the set of coupled equations is very similar to the wigner - poisson problem @xcite used to model electron transport through diodes .",
    "together with the impact ionization cross sections , the coupled equations ( [ eq : boltzmann ] ) and ( [ eq : electrical_field ] ) are a non - linear integro - differential equation coupled to a scalar partial differential equation for the electrical field .",
    "this equation in its full dimension is hard to solve , both analytically and numerically . as a first step ,",
    "we look at the one - dimensional streamer fronts of the boltzmann equation in the lattice boltzmann discretization .      in this section ,",
    "we discretize the one - dimensional boltzmann equation .",
    "the distribution functions @xmath23 are discretized on a lattice in space , velocity and time .",
    "the grid spacing is @xmath24 in space and @xmath25 in time .",
    "the velocity grid of @xmath26 is chosen such that the distance traveled in a single time step , @xmath27 , is a multiple of the grid distance @xmath24 , or in short @xmath28 typically , only a small set of discrete velocities is used .",
    "a discretization with three grid points on the velocity grid has a set @xmath29 and is called a d1q3 model .",
    "a discretization with five grid points has @xmath30 and is a d1q5 model .",
    "the size of the set @xmath31 is denoted by @xmath32 .",
    "we will also denote @xmath33 for the dimensionless velocity .",
    "note that , for ease of notation , we will also use the set @xmath31 to index matrices .",
    "for example , the result of a linear operator @xmath34 working on a vector @xmath35 will be denoted as @xmath36 , where both the indices @xmath37 and @xmath38 are in @xmath31 .",
    "the means that the @xmath39 matrix element with @xmath30 is the matrix element in the upper left corner of the matrix .",
    "we start from the continuous equation for the distribution function in the discrete point @xmath40 in phase space at time @xmath41 . in the absence of external forces ,",
    "the boltzmann equation in this point reads @xmath42 a discrete lattice boltzmann equation is now obtained by replacing the time derivative with an explicit forward difference , the introduction of an upwind discretization of the convection term and a downwind discretization of the collision term @xmath43 and replace it with @xmath44 @xcite , @xmath45 note that this discretization of the spatial derivative becomes less accurate for the largest speeds in the set @xmath31 .",
    "indeed , in the five speed model , for example , the largest speed is @xmath46 , and the convection term will be calculated from the difference between @xmath47 and @xmath48 , which is @xmath49 apart .",
    "the discretization error is then proportional to @xmath49 .",
    "equation reduces to @xmath50 where we have introduced the shorthand @xmath51 for @xmath52 and @xmath53 for @xmath44 with @xmath54 .",
    "the collision term consists out of two parts @xmath55 where the first term will model the electron diffusion , the second term the ionization reactions and the third term the influence of the external force .",
    "note that we also incorporated @xmath25 in the notation .",
    "we will now discuss the two terms individually .",
    "the first term models the electron diffusion as a bgk relaxation process @xcite . in this approximation",
    ", it assumed that the distribution is attracted to a local equilibrium distribution function @xmath56 , @xmath57 with @xmath58 the equilibrium distribution for electron diffusion . in the five speed model ,",
    "we choose @xmath59 and @xmath60 the electron density .",
    "this choice of equilibrium weights conserves the number of electrons , but does not conserve momentum as a traditional fluid would do . indeed , the electrons diffuse because they randomly change their direction during the elastic collisions with the much heavier neutral molecular particles .",
    "we further chose the weights such that there are no fast particles under diffusive equilibrium .",
    "the relaxation time @xmath61 is related to the electron diffusion coefficient @xmath62 note that , in the literature , the relaxation time @xmath61 is often characterized by its inverse @xmath63 .",
    "the second term in is the reaction term @xmath64 that is modelled with a @xmath65 matrix @xmath66 @xmath67 which represents the velocity dependent reaction rates and allows us to select between slow and fast particles .",
    "for the five speed model , we choose a reaction matrix @xmath68 that describes how the reaction cross sections depend on the velocities of the particles .",
    "each time step @xmath25 , a fraction @xmath69 of the particles with speed @xmath70 will collide and cause a ionization reaction .",
    "the reaction rate @xmath69 is chosen to match the height of the cross section , see figure [ fig : cross_section ] . since the colliding fast particles transfer their energy to the bound electron , they will loose energy .",
    "therefore , the number of particles with speed @xmath70 diminishes with a rate @xmath71 and we have @xmath72 . at the same time , the number of slow electrons increases because both the impact electron and the ionization electron emerge as slow particles with speed @xmath73 .",
    "because of the coulomb repulsion , the two slow electrons are more likely to emerge in opposite directions and we choose the rates such that one electron emerges with speed of @xmath74 and the other with @xmath75 .",
    "this choice of model parameters ensures that the energy balance during the ionization reaction is not violated . as discussed in section [ sub : the - physics - of ] , the energy of the incoming electron is larger that the sum of the energies of the escaping electrons because some of the impact energy covers the binding energy of the bound electron . in the above model",
    ", a single ionization reaction transforms one electron with speed @xmath76 into two electrons with , respectively , speed @xmath75 and speed @xmath74 .",
    "the energy of the impact electron is @xmath77 , while the sum of the escaping electrons is merely @xmath78 , where @xmath32 is the mass of the electron .",
    "so a portion @xmath79 of the impact energy covers the binding energy . for our model , this is half of the initial impact energy ; for more general problems other values are possible .",
    "we now derive a discretization of the @xmath80 term that models the external force in the boltzmann equation .",
    "we start by expanding @xmath81 where @xmath82 forms a linear independent set of vectors in @xmath83 .",
    "we find the coefficients @xmath84 by enforcing the galerkin condition .",
    "@xmath85 in the current paper , we choose a particular set of vectors in @xmath86 , namely the polynomials @xmath87 discretized in the points @xmath88 . for the five speed example the vectors are , besides their powers of @xmath89 , @xmath90 the galerkin condition leads to the linear system @xmath91 where @xmath92,@xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 .    to calculate the right - hand side of we make a detour around the continuous representation .",
    "we note that @xmath96 where @xmath97 .",
    "because of our particular choice of basis vectors and the fact that there are no particles with infinite velocities , we have that @xmath98 or , in other words , @xmath99 with the help of @xmath100 we can now define @xmath101 and calculate the external force term as @xmath102 where the elements of @xmath31 denote matrix elements .    from eq .",
    "( [ external force ] ) , it is clear that we can include the external force as an additional collision term in the right - hand side of the lattice boltzmann equation .",
    "the evolution of the electrical field @xmath103 is determined by the net flux @xmath104 of electrons as expressed in .",
    "we discretize on a staggered grid with grid points halfway between the grid points of the lattice boltzmann model .",
    "the flux is defined as the number of particles that move between grid points ( pass through an interface ) within a single time step .",
    "for the five speed model , we have @xmath105      the coupled equations and for the evolution of the electron distribution functions and the electrical field is now , after discretization , @xmath106 @xmath107 where @xmath108 is calculated from .",
    "the equations are coupled because the electrical field appears as an external force in the first equation , while the flux drives the evolution of the electrical field in the second equation .",
    "this coupling makes the evolution of the system non - linear .",
    "the model ( [ ionizationlbm])([ionizatione ] ) evolves the electrical field @xmath103 and the distribution functions @xmath109 from @xmath41 to @xmath110 simultaneously .",
    "alternatively , the evolution of the distribution functions can be rewritten in terms of the corresponding ( dimensionless ) velocity moments defined as @xmath111 where @xmath112 .",
    "the zeroth moment @xmath113 corresponds to the electron density @xmath60 , i.e.  the macroscopic variable of interest .",
    "the transformation between distribution functions @xmath114 and moments @xmath115 can be written as a matrix transformation @xmath116 . in the five speed model ,",
    "this matrix is @xmath117 such that @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "an evolution law for @xmath120 is now easily constructed by the following sequence : first transform @xmath115 into @xmath51 using @xmath121 , then use the lattice boltzmann equation to evolve @xmath51 to @xmath122 and , then , transform back to the moments @xmath123 .    it has been observed phenomenological that the ionization wave can approximately be described by a pde in the density .",
    "this suggests that , in practice , the evolution of these moments is rapidly attracted to a low dimensional manifold described by the lowest moment @xmath124 , which is the density .",
    "the higher order moments have then become functional of this density and the dynamics of the system can effectively be described by the evolution of this macroscopic moment .    in general , however , it is very hard to find analytic expressions for this low dimensional description in the form of a pde without making crude approximations . for the problem at hand ,",
    "we illustrate these difficulties in this section where we apply the chapman - enskog expansion and derive a macroscopic pde in terms of electron density . only after dropping several coupling terms ,",
    "a closed pde is derived .    the model discussed in the previous sections",
    "can be summarized by the lattice boltzmann equation @xmath125 for @xmath126 . here , @xmath127 can be the reaction term @xmath128 , a force term @xmath129 , or a combination of both .",
    "a second order taylor expansion of the term @xmath130 in around @xmath131 leads to @xmath132 we then expand @xmath114 in terms of increasingly higher order contributions as follows @xmath133 with @xmath134 a small tracer parameter . in fluid dynamics , @xmath134 typically refers to the knudsen number .",
    "the spatial and time derivatives are scaled respectively as @xmath135 where we explicitly presume that a zeroth order time scale @xmath136 is present in the system .",
    "as we will show later on , this scale corresponds to the observed exponential growth of the electron density .",
    "because of the multiple time scales @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 , all the terms in the expansion will couple to all the time scales , which complicates the derivation of an effective equation .    in our search for a reduced second order pde model",

    "the reaction rates are a chosen to model the ionization reaction , where fast particles have a given probability to undergo an ionization reaction and create two slow particles .",
    "the electrical field changes simultaneously as a result of the charge creation .",
    "this macroscopic behavior of the model was analyzed with two methods .",
    "the first is the more traditional analysis based on a chapman - enskog expansion that derives an approximate pde model and the corresponding transport coefficients .",
    "the resulting pde model is very similar to the minimal streamer model of ebert , van saarloos and caroli , where the ionization rate depends on the local electrical field .",
    "based on the transport coefficients , we found the dependence of the critical speed ( below which the traveling waves are unphysical ) and its dependence on the strength of the ionization cross section .",
    "our second method is a computational method based on the coarse - grained time - stepper , which defines the effective evolution law as a sequence of computational steps .",
    "the traveling wave solutions were formulated as fixed points of this coarse - grained time - stepper combined with a shift - back operator . by varying the applied shift - back",
    ", we again found the critical speed , and we demonstrated how to calculate its dependence on the cross section strength numerically .",
    "we showed that the coarse - grained time - stepper provides a viable alternative to the traditional chapman - enskog analysis .",
    "however , in this paper , we did not make any statements about which of the two methods provides the most accurate information .",
    "both methods make approximations to obtain the critical velocity of the proposed lattice boltzmann model .",
    "in contrast to the theoretical approximations in the chapman - enskog analysis , these approximations are due to numerical accuracy for the coarse - grained time - stepper .",
    "further progress in the accuracy can be made in several ways .",
    "first , the lifting can be done more accurately if a higher order constrained runs algorithm is used .",
    "such a method would take multiple steps with the lattice boltzmann model and uses these multiple points to provide us with an approximate initial state @xcite .",
    "we expect that these higher order lifting procedures will reproduce more than two terms in the chapman - enskog series and therefore provide a better initial state for the simulation step .",
    "this will allow limiting the number of simulation steps , which will immediately improve the accuracy of the computed solutions and the critical speed .",
    "although the model problem in this paper is non - trivial , and the chapman - enskog expansion is tedious , we emphasize that our method is mainly developed with applications in sight where the traditional chapman - enskog analysis is completely intractable . the model problem in this paper both allows us to analyze the proposed methods and provide directions for further development . in a forthcoming article , we will do a complete analysis of the traveling wave solutions in the proposed model and illustrate more extensively how the macroscopic behavior depends on the parameters of the microscopic model . in our calculations , we have also observed the positively charged fronts that move in the opposite direction of the electrical field .",
    "these solutions have been discussed by ebert et al in @xcite and our methods are also able to locate these states .",
    "we expect that most of the results presented in this paper will remain valid when the number of velocities in the discretization of the boltzmann model is increased . with additional velocities ,",
    "it is possible to model the cross sections of colliding particles with more detail and study other reactions than the ionization reaction",
    ". it would also be interesting to study models with multiple species where the collision rates between the particles are velocity dependent .",
    "this would allow us to include photo - ionization effects into the minimal streamer model , an important effect that is neglected in the current model @xcite .",
