    "statistical mechanics has revealed many interesting properties for nonequilibrium systems . the fluctuation theorem ( ft )",
    "was first discovered for a deterministic nonequilibrium system driven by a shearing force  @xcite .",

    "the violation of the fluctuation and dissipation relation is also an important characteristics for nonequilibrium systems  @xcite .",
    "the existence of nonzero current is a main consequence observed in the nonequilibrium steady state ( ness ) closely related with the violation of the detailed balance ( db ) which have been studied up to date  @xcite .",
    "there are several sources to drive a system into nonequilibrium such as an external driving  @xcite , a contact with multiple heat or particle reservoirs  @xcite , a non - conservative force  @xcite , a time - dependent perturbation for external parameter  @xcite , etc .",
    "we recently studied the case in which nonequilibrium is driven by the combination of two sources , the nonconservative force and multiple noises that are not identically and independently distributed  @xcite .",
    "there may be a stochastic process where thermodynamic quantities such as energy , heat , and work are not defined , most likely in biology @xcite .",
    "one of us ( p. a. ) suggested a way to transform a stochastic differential equation for position like variables to that for position - momentum pairs in zero mass limit  @xcite . in one dimension",
    "it is equivalent to the usual overdamped limit while it is not the case in high dimensions , giving rise to a new stochastic process not derived by the ito or stratonovich type calculus  @xcite .",
    "it is yet an open problem how to construct the probability density function ( pdf ) for the ness which is the counter part of the boltzmann factor for the equilibrium case .",
    "there have been only a few examples where the pdf is rigorously found  @xcite .",
    "the so called potential landscape function is defined as minus the logarithm of the pdf , which corresponds to inverse temperature times the potential or energy for equilibrium systems .",

    "we obtain the potential landscape function and the circulating ness current for the system driven by a nonlinear drift force in the presence of noises not identically and independently distributed .",
    "we find a very peculiar landscape picture that can not be expected easily from a given drift force .",
    "it is the generalization of our previous study for the linear drift force  @xcite . for the nonlinear drift force , which can not be treated rigorously ,",

    "the ness is characterized by nonzero @xmath24 which is divergenceless since @xmath25 . for the localized system , that we are considering in this paper ,",
    "circulation is the only way for divergenceless current . on the other hand , for the extended system it is directed through the system from one to another boundary .",
    "there were interesting works on the noise induced directed current in an one - dimensional extended system with the periodic boundary condition , which explains well the transportation of drugs or molecules in biological systems @xcite .",
    "there are common ingredients for the two cases , circulating and directed currents , which we will discuss later .",
    "let us define the force matrix @xmath26 and the potential matrix @xmath27 respectively as @xmath28 then the db condition gives @xmath29 , which leads to the condition : @xmath30 which can be obtained by using @xmath31 .",

    "we found @xmath46 where @xmath47 is an antisymmetric matrix and independent of @xmath6 .",

    "for the nonlinear drift force , however , the antisymmetric matrix is not a sufficient measure for the ness",
    ". we can write @xmath54 a new term @xmath55 gives a current flowing off the equiprobability surface .",
    "then the drift force is decomposed into three parts : @xmath56 a similar idea of decomposition was used in earlier works by graham and tl @xcite , where they concentrated only on the dissipative part , the first term , in our terminology .",
    "a vector potential @xmath57 was introduced by qian @xcite to describe a circular flux and the global transport in a two dimensional motor protein movement , where @xmath58 corresponds to the circulating current in our study .",

    "the superscript @xmath70 denotes the perturbation due to the nonlinear drift coefficients .",
    "the perturbation theory is expected to be the same as the low noise limit , i.e. , the small @xmath9 limit , since the pdf is dominant near fixed point in this limit .",
    "we then proceed the perturbation theory up to the first order in @xmath71 , @xmath72 , both treated as of the same order .",
    "it is the same sense as in the perturbation theory for the anharmonic effect of the lattice vibration where the cubic and quartic terms in the potential are treated as of the same order in order to give a bound potential .",
    "note that the linear term @xmath73 in @xmath74 is responsible for the shift of the pdf maximum from @xmath65 .",
    "the moments of the pdf comprise a set of correlation functions written in terms of the coefficients of @xmath74 . on the other hand we will find the moments directly from the langevin equation in the fourier space",

    "for this example the current in the zeroth order vanishes .",
    "we take a larger value for @xmath223 .",

    "the circulation takes place across the contour line , which is an important characteristics for the ness together with the shift of the pdf maximum from the fixed point .",
    "however , it is quite surprising that there appear several centers of circulation .",
    "we have investigated the potential landscape and the ness current for the localized stochastic system driven by the nonlinear drift force and in contact with nonuniform noises . unlike the extended system the induced ness current is circulating . for the linear drift force",
    "it was found to circulate around the equiprobability surface  @xcite with the probability maximum at the fixed point of the drift force . in this study",
    "we have found that the ness current flows off the equiprobability surface and circulates around multiple centers .",
    "the pdf maximum is found to shift from the fixed point of the drift force .",
    "for an example we take a familiar potential well yielding a conservative force .",
    "difference is made only by noise correlation .",
    "however , it turns out that the resultant potential landscape , having multiple centers of current circulation , is rather drastically deformed from the equilibrium shape .",
    "circulation is found to split into two parts and the boundary current fills up the discontinuity of the current flowing on the equiprobability surface .",
    "however , further investigation is needed for a more plausible explanation based on the physical origin .",
    "noise induced transverse force might be a possible origin , which is not confirmed yet .",
    "they are novel phenomena caused by the combination of two causes , the nonlinearity of the drift force and the nonuniformity of high dimensional noises .",
    "interestingly they are basically equivalent to the two ingredients for the noise induced transportation current found for the extended periodic system : the ratchet type potential ( nonlinear force ) and the additional noise ( high dimensional nonuniform noises )  @xcite .",
    "our finding is based on the first order perturbation theory that is valid in the low noise limit .",
    "it is confirmed by numerical simulations .",
    "it is interesting to realize the ness with a circulating current experimentally , probably in an optical trap experiment in two dimensions .",
    "it is a challenging task to produce noises experimentally which are not identically and independently distributed .",
    "force in experiments may be conservative and then the force matrix @xmath26 is symmetric . in this case",
    "one can still produce a nonequilibrium situation if the principal axes of the diffusion matrix are chosen to be different from those of @xmath26 , as suggested by filliger et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the fluctuation of nonequilibrium work production has recently been studied for the linear case  @xcite .",
    "there are interesting properties found such as the exponential tail with a power law prefactor of the work distribution function and the dynamic phase transition in the exponent of the prefactor .",
    "the properties of the ness for the nonlinear case are found to be quite different from that for the linear case . in this sense",
    "it will be interesting to study the nonlinear case from the point of view of the fluctuation theorem .",
