    "the hubbard model ( hm)@xcite is one of the simplest nontrivial models of interacting spin-1/2 electrons on a lattice .",

    "the hm can be solved exactly by the bethe - ansatz method.@xcite the wave function and the energy of @xmath8 electrons on a chain with @xmath9 sites can be written in terms of @xmath10 pseudo - momentum variables and @xmath11 spin rapidities . although the energy spectra have been known for many years , the calculation of the correlation functions proved to be a delicate problem .",
    "@xcite the numerical evaluations of the correlation functions @xcite and the analytic results @xcite indicated clearly that the 1d hm is a tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( tll).@xcite assuming that the 1d hm is tll , it then becomes possible to calculate the correlation functions from the knowledge of the energy spectra @xcite . using this procedure schulz",
    "@xcite studied the correlation - function exponents for different @xmath7 and band filling @xmath12 .",
    "it is also shown@xcite that the large scale behavior of the spin and charge degrees of freedom can be described by two decoupled boson field theories with dynamics governed by the tll hamiltonian in the small and large @xmath7 regimes .",
    "another nontrivial model is the falicov - kimball model @xcite which consists of localized ions and itinerant spinless fermions .",
    "the hamiltonian of the falicov - kimball model reads @xmath13 where @xmath14 are creation operators for spinless fermions , and the configuration @xmath15 denote spatial distribution of ions .",
    "clearly , the fkm can be viewed as a modification of the hm in the sense that the one kind of fermions , such as down - spin fermions , has infinite mass , and hence does not move . nevertheless , the physics of the fkm is completely different . in the neutral case where each particle concentration equals @xmath16 , it was @xcite proved that the system always orders in an alternating `` chessboard '' phase at a finite transition temperature in all dimensions greater than 1",
    ". this ordered phase can be interpreted as the transition from a high - temperature homogeneous ( liquid / gas ) phase to a low temperature ordered ( solid ) phase .",
    "freericks@xcite showed that the model ( on a hypercubic lattice ) also displayed incommensurate order , segregation or phase separation .",
    "the 1d case of the fkm has also been extensively studied .",
    "since there is no finite - temperature phase transition , the system can have phase transition in the ground state .",
    "the numerical solutions @xcite produced a conjecture for the case @xmath17 with @xmath18 and the screened coulomb interaction @xmath7 is large enough , the system will segregate into an empty lattice ( with no ions and all the electrons ) , and a full lattice ( with all the ions and no electrons ) . this conjecture was later proven to be true by lemberger @xcite . for any dimensional hfm , freericks _ etal _",
    "@xcite gave a theorem that the strong correlation can leads to ps .",
    "the relation between the hm and the fkm is straightforward . in order to have a unified framework ,",
    "the asymmetric hubbard model ( ahm ) has been introduced naturally .",
    "@xcite its hamiltonian reads @xmath19 where @xmath20 is @xmath3-dependent hoping integral . clearly , if @xmath21 , the ahm becomes the hm , and if @xmath22 , it becomes the fkm .",

    "the ahm is believed to describe many physical phenomena , such as superconductor , valence fluctuating , and heavy fermions.@xcite in the recent development of the optical lattice , it has been pointed out that the ahm can be used to describe a mixture of two species of fermionic atoms in optical lattices .",
    "@xcite    according to the fact that the ground states of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian_ahm ] ) in its two limiting cases : the hm ( @xmath25 ) and the fkm ( @xmath26 ) belong to two different universality classes , a quantum phase transition was suggested to happen in the phase diagram defined in the @xmath27 plane.@xcite nevertheless , the quantitative phase diagram for the case away from half - filling had never been obtained until a recent work by gu , _ et al _ @xcite . in their work , the quantum entanglement @xcite between a local part and the rest of the system , and the structure factor of charge - density - wave ( cdw ) for down - spin electrons",
    "are used to identify the critical point . here",
    ", we are going to study the ground - state phase diagram of the ahm away from the half filling with the strategy of bosonization method . @xcite",
    "differ from the numerical approach @xcite which captures the physics from the finite - size analysis for small systems , our work aim to give definitely analytical results from the point of view of field theory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : bos ] , we derive the bosonized form of the 1d ahm , and clarify the role of the some terms in the hamiltonian . in section [ sec : res ] , we first diagonalize the effective hamiltonian in which some irrelevant terms are ignored , then obtain the instability conditions for the phase separation and compare them with the numerical results of a finite sample",
    ". we also obtain the analytical expressions for the correlation functions of charge - density - wave , spin - density - wave ( sdw ) , singlet - superconductivity ( ss ) , triplet - superconductivity ( ts ) fluctuations , as well as the corresponding exponents .",
    "finally , a brief summary and acknowledgement are given in section [ sec : sum ] .",
