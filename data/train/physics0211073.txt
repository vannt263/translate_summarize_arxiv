    "in several areas of research , the feedback of a propagating diffusive ( pre - mixed combustion ) flame on a fluid , and the consequent effects of the flame itself , is of considerable interest . in the astrophysical context , for example , the speedup of nuclear reaction fronts of this type in the interior of white dwarf stars is thought to be one possible way that such stars undergo thermonuclear disruption , e.g. , a type ia supernova ( cf .",
    "much of the literature on this subject has focused on the speedup of such flames for prescribed flows , and substantial advances have been made in this regard recently @xcite ; this is the `` kinematic '' problem , in which one seeks to establish rigorous limits on flame speedup in the case in which there is no feedback onto the flow .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the simplest case of feedback , namely that which occurs when a flame propagates vertically , against the direction of gravity .",
    "as described extensively in the previously cited literature , it is generally believed that under such circumstances , the flame front is likely to become distorted by the action of the rayleigh - taylor instability , and thus achieves speedup ; these calculations have been largely illustrative , and based upon simulations using fully - compressible fluid dynamics ( e.g. , @xcite ) and fairly realistic nuclear reaction networks .    here ,",
    "we focus on a much simpler problem ; we study such flames in the boussinesq limit ( leading to a far simpler computational problem ) and for highly simplified reaction terms ( avoiding the complexities of realistic nuclear reaction networks ) . in this way",
    ", we are able to isolate the various effects which lead to flame speedup , which is particularly important if one is to connect such simulations to the extant analytical work on this subject ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , an important motivation for this work is to elucidate simple scaling laws  if they exist  in order to suggest further analytical studies .",
    "our paper is structured as follows : in the next section , we describe the specific physical problem we wish to study , establish the equations to be solved , and describe the method of solution . in  iii , we present our results , and in  iv , we provide a summary and discussion .",
    "the effect of gravity on the temperature distribution in a reacting incompressible fluid with thermal diffusivity @xmath0 , viscosity @xmath1 , and density @xmath2 can be described by the set of navier - stokes and advection - diffusion - reaction equations , @xmath3 & = &      - \\nabla p + \\mu \\nabla^2 { \\bf v } + \\rho { \\bf g } ,      \\nonumber      \\\\      \\frac{\\partial t } { \\partial t } + { \\bf v } \\cdot \\nabla t & = &      \\kappa \\nabla^2 t + r(t ) ,      \\label{eqns_vt }      \\\\      \\nabla \\cdot { \\bf v } & = & 0 ,      \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the fluid velocity and , without loss of generality , the temperature @xmath5 has been normalized to satisfy @xmath6 .",
    "the thermal diffusivity and viscosity are assumed to be temperature - independent , and density variations are assumed to be small enough to be described by the boussinesq model , e.g. , @xmath7 . the model ( [ eqns_vt ] )",
    "can be derived from a more complete system under the assumption of unity lewis number @xmath8 ( the ratio of thermal and material diffusivities ) , and this article addresses only the @xmath9 case .    the boussinesq model is the simplest system exibiting buoyancy effects ( and thus allowing for feedback to the flame ) without introducing the complexities associated with the presence of sound wave and stratification of background `` atmosphere '' . because our intentions is to elucidate basic priciples , rather than realistically modeling specific physical situations , we view our approach as sufficient for the chosen task .    we consider a reaction term of kolmogorov - petrovskii - piskunov ( kpp ) type @xcite , of the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the ( laminar ) reaction rate .",
    "this reaction form has an unstable fixed point at @xmath12 , the `` unburned '' state , and a stable one at @xmath13 , the `` burned '' state .",
    "thus a fluid element with positive temperature will inevitably evolve to the burned state in a characteristic time of order @xmath14 . as is well - known from the combustion literature , the temperature equation from the system above admits  for a stationary fluid , and in the absence of gravity  one - dimensional solutions in the form of burning fronts propagating with laminar burning speed @xmath15 , and with characteristic flame thickness @xmath16 , @xmath17 if it is further assumed that @xmath18 as @xmath19 , and @xmath20 as @xmath21 , then the front propagation is in the positive @xmath22 direction .",
    "it is convenient to adopt the front thickness @xmath16 and the inverse reaction rate @xmath23 as the units of distance and time respectively . in these units",
    "the problem control parameters are the prandtl number @xmath24 and the non - dimensional gravity @xmath25 , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a kinematic viscosity @xmath28 .",
    "in addition , the system is characterized by a number of length scales specifying the initial state , which are in our case the dimensionless amplitude @xmath29 and the dimensionless wavelength @xmath30 of the initial flame front perturbation , @xmath31 , @xmath32    the vertical size of the computational domain was kept large so as to avoid effects due to the upper and lower walls of the computational box ; in all cases , we have verified that such artifacts are not present .",
    "for this reason , the box height does not enter as a problem parameter .",
    "the initial velocities are set to zero , and most computations were carried out for @xmath33 .",
    "a typical initial state of our flame calculation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_intro ] .    =    because we focus on the two - dimensional problem , it is convenient to re - write eqns .",

    "@xmath4 is the non - dimensional velocity and @xmath37 is the non - dimensional vorticity ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "we solve the system ( eqns .",
    "[ eq : omegat ] ) numerically .",
    "the solution is advanced in time as follows : a third order adams - bashforth integration in time advances @xmath37 and @xmath5 , where spatial derivatives of @xmath37 and @xmath5 are approximated by fourth - order ( explicit ) finite differences . the subsequent elliptic equation for @xmath39",
    "is then solved by the bi - conjugate gradient method with stabilization , using the aztec library @xcite .",
    "finally we take derivatives of @xmath39 to update @xmath4 .",
    "the resolution of the simulations was chosen to fully resolve the laminar flame structure .",
    "for the kpp reaction term ( [ eq : kpp ] ) , the laminar flame thickness is approximately @xmath40 , and the grid spacing @xmath41 ( in the units of @xmath16 ) was used in most of the computations .",
    "the laminar flame speed computed at this resolution agrees with the theoretical value to within 1% .",
    "this corresponds to at least @xmath42  zones per wavelength ( of the initial perturbation ) which is sufficient to resolve the flow .",
    "most of the computations were executed on a domain half the width of the initial perturbation wavelength , and reflecting boundary conditions were applied .",
    "simulation times of @xmath43 ",
    "@xmath44 ( in units of @xmath45 ) were required to measure the bulk burning rate , on computational grids ranging from @xmath46 for @xmath47 to @xmath48 for @xmath49 .",
    "larger domains were necessary to obtain velocity fields ( e.g. @xmath50 for @xmath49 ) , to avoid the influence of boundary conditions at the top and bottom . fortunately , only the velocity in the reaction region affects the shape of the flame front and , consequently , the bulk burning rate , so slight errors in estimating velocities far away from the front due to upper and lower boundaries do not affect our results .",
    "the comparison with linear analysis was done using the same resolution and domain sizes up to @xmath51 .    by its nature , this study was comprised of a large number ( @xmath52 ) of simulations each representing a data point , as opposed to a close examination of just a few simulations as in a case - study approach .",
    "confidence in the numerical accuracy was gained at the cost of a small number of additional test simulations .",
    "some simulations were repeated using lower and higher resolutions , domains of different sizes in vertical direction , and with several wavelengths across the width of the domain .",
    "special attention was devoted to simulations with different prandtl numbers , to ensure that both diffusive and viscous scales were resolved .",
    "finally , a comment regarding the two - dimensional nature of our simulations . in a recent study of the closely related rayleigh - taylor instability @xcite , young et al . specifically compared the behavior of fingering and mixing in two- and three - dimensional flows , with the result that while the specifics , e.g. , finger growth rates , were quite sensitive to dimensionality , the phenomenology nevertheless turned out to be rather similar .",
    "flames do however introduce a very useful physical simplification into the rayleigh - taylor problem : because flames consume all density features at the flame front with scales smaller than the flame thickness , the rayleigh - taylor problem is  regularized \" by the burning process even in the limit of vanishing viscosity .",
    "for this reason , a key difference between 2-d and 3-d  namely , the difference between small - scale turbulent structures in two and three dimensions  is sharply reduced in the burning case .",
    "the remaining difference between 2-d and 3-d is then mostly related to the difference in propagation speed between buoyant parallel rolls ( the 2-d case ) and buoyant tori ( the 3-d case ) , with tori propagation more quickly , i.e. , we would expect 3-d flames to propagate more quickly than 2-d flames , all other things being equal .",
    "we plan to explore this point in future three - dimensional studies of flame propagation .",
    "in this section , we discuss the results of our calculations , focusing successively on the bulk burning rate , the evolution of the burning travelling front , and the ultimate transition to a travelling ( burning ) wave .",
    "our central interest is in disentangling the dependence of the flame behavior on the key control parameters of the problem .      for a wide range of parameters",
    ", we were able to construct a sufficiently large computational domain that we could observe travelling waves of the temperature distribution , propagating with constant speed .",
    "depending on simulation parameters , the initial perturbation either damps ( e.g. , the flame front flattens ) or forms a curved front .",
    "the flat front moves in the motion - free ( in the boussinesq limit ) fluid , has laminar front structure , and propagates with the laminar front speed .",
    "=    the typical curved front is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_levels ] ; it has the wavelength of the initial perturbation and is characterized by narrow dips ( lower apexes ) , where the cold fluid falls into the hot region , and by wide tips ( upper apexes ) , where buoyant hot fluid rises into the cold fluid . in the initial stages , the evolution pattern is similar to bubble and spike formation during the rayleigh - taylor instability @xcite ; in later stages , small scale structures are consumed by the flame , and , finally , the flame evolves toward the travelling wave solution shown in fig .  [ fig_levels ] .",
    "the shape of the stable front is determined by gravity , @xmath25 , and wavelength , @xmath30 , and can be characterized by two vertical length scales associated with the spatial temperature variation ( @xmath53 ) and the spatial velocity variation ( @xmath54 ) of the flame .",
    "the speed of the curved front is always higher than the laminar flame speed , because of the increase in the flame front area and transport .",
    "finally , we notice that the streamlines in fig .",
    "[ fig_levels ] indicate that the flow underlying the propagating flame is characterized by rolls propagating upward .",
    "one of our primary interests is to quantify the effects of variations in wavelength and gravity on the flame speed .",
    "it is convenient to define the speed of the travelling wave flame by the bulk burning rate @xcite , @xmath55 this definition has the considerable advantage that it reduces to the standard definition of the flame speed when the flame is well - defined , and it is accurate to measure even for cases where the burning front itself is not well - defined .",
    "henceforth we refer to it simply as the flame speed .    =    our first result ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_flame_speed ] ) is that the flame speed increases with wavelength @xmath30 and with the gravitational acceleration @xmath25 , and is independent of the initial perturbation amplitude @xmath29 .",
    "more specifically , the flame becomes planar and moves at the laminar speed ( @xmath56 ) if @xmath25 is smaller than some critical value @xmath57 ; if @xmath25 lies above this critical value , the flame speed can be fit by the expression , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is obtained from measurements derived from the simulation data .",
    "the second tuning parameter , @xmath60 , was found to be a function of the perturbation wavelength ( fig .",
    "[ fig_transitional_gravity ] ) , @xmath61 . for a relatively wide range of parameters , eq .",
    "( [ eq_flame_speed ] ) describes experimental data well , but must be applied with caution near the cusp at @xmath62 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_flame_speed ] . roughly speaking",
    ", this cusp can be interpreted as the transition between the planar and curved flame regimes , @xmath63 ; closer investigation of the transition region shows that @xmath64 , and that the fit ( eq .  [ eq_flame_speed ] ) underestimates the flame speed in this transition region ( fig .",
    "[ fig_ht ] ) .",
    "=    =    the behavior near the transition is discussed in detail in the theoretical work carried out by berestycki , kamin & sivashinsky @xcite .",
    "they derive the one - dimensional evolution equation for the front interface @xmath65 and prove mathematically the following properties of @xmath65 , relevant to our case : ( 1 )  the existence of @xmath66 such that there is no nontrivial solution for @xmath67 ( i.e. the front is flat for @xmath67 ) ; ( 2 )  the existence of @xmath68 such that for @xmath69 there are two symmetrical ( curved ) solutions @xmath70 and @xmath71 which are stable , and any other solution including the trivial is unstable ; ( 3 )  metastability of any solution except @xmath70 and @xmath71 in the range @xmath72 , and convergence of this metastable solution to either @xmath70 or @xmath71 . also , based on the derivation in @xcite",
    ", it can be shown that the flame speed in the metastable regime scales as follows @xcite , @xmath73    our simulations confirm the dramatic increase of stabilization times close to the critical gravity value @xmath57 .",
    "for this reason , it is very difficult to obtain reliable results regarding the flame speed in this transition regime .",
    "even detecting the critical point takes significant computational effort ( fig .",
    "[ fig_ht ] ) ; measuring the velocity , which in this parameter regime differs from @xmath15 by a very small amount , is harder still .",
    "however , the transition is sharper and is easier to see when studying the vertical distance between the upper and lower apexes of the flame , @xmath53 , measured by the expression , @xmath74 in the limit of large wavelengths ( @xmath75 ) , the transition occurs at small values of gravity , and the flame speed is determined by a single parameter , the product @xmath76 .",
    "if , in addition , the product @xmath76 is large , the flame speed scales as @xmath77 .",
    "this result is in good agreement with the rising bubble model @xcite which , in the boussinesq limit , predicts @xmath78 for a 2-d open bubble @xcite .",
    "we further observe that in the large wavelength limit , the @xmath79 ratio obeys the same scaling ( fig .",
    "[ fig_ht ] ) .",
    "we note that the flame structure shares features of flame propagation from both shear and cellular flow .",
    "for instance , the temperature distribution closely resembles that of a flame distorted by a shear flow , while the velocity distribution resembles that inside an infinitely tall cell .",
    "the flame speed in the shear and cellular flow is determined by the flow speed and by the length scale of the flow ( period of shear or cell size ) @xcite .",
    "in particular , in both cases the flow speed scales with maximum flow velocity as @xmath80 , with @xmath81 for burning in the shear flow and @xmath82 for burning in the cellular flow .",
    "similarly , we have tried to determine whether the flame speed relates to the maximum velocity of the flow when flow and flame are coupled through the boussinesq model .",
    "the available data ( shown in fig .  [ fig_vmax ] ) do not demonstrate a power law dependence with a single well - defined power .",
    "furthermore , the dependence on @xmath30 is not as dramatic as in the cases of shear or cellular flows",
    ".    =      the thin front limit is particularly important for developing models of flame behavior .",
    "for many applications  especially in astrophysics  resolving flames ( by direct simulation ) is prohibitively expensive , and understanding flame propagation in the limit in which the flame front becomes indefinitely thin ( when compared to other length scales of the application ) is critical for designing flame models .",
    "of course , this same limit is of intrinsic mathematical interest .    particularly important",
    "is the dependence of the flame speed on the wavelength of the front perturbation in the thin front limit .",
    "we have already pointed out that instabilities with larger wavelengths have higher travelling wave speeds , so that eventually the instability with the largest wavelength allowed by the system dominates .",
    "( in our non - dimensionalization , this is the instability with the highest ratio of wavelength to laminar front width ) .",
    "in this context , it is convenient to switch from our `` laminar flame units '' to the so - called `` g - equation units '' .",
    "the g - equation is a model for reactive systems where very low thermal diffusivity is exactly balanced by high reaction rate ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . the diffusion and reaction terms in the temperature equation",
    "are replaced by a term proportional to the temperature gradient , @xmath83 so that the front propagates normal to itself at the laminar flame speed @xmath15 .",
    "the boussinesq fluid model , combined with the g - equation flame model , has the following physical parameters : ( 1 ) flow length scale @xmath84 , ( 2 ) laminar flame speed @xmath15 , ( 3 ) gravity @xmath85 , and ( 4 ) fluid viscosity @xmath27 .",
    "choosing @xmath84 and @xmath86 as the length and time units , the governing non - dimensional parameters are @xmath87 and @xmath88 ; the corresponding parameters in the laminar flame unit system are @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "note that in the limit @xmath91 while keeping @xmath33 , the navier - stokes equation becomes the euler equation and @xmath92 , leaving only one parameter in the system , @xmath93 .",
    ".[tab : table1 ] three simulations with @xmath94 discussed in the text . [ cols=\"^,>,^,>,>,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in our simulations @xmath33 ,",
    "so it is not surprising that for large @xmath30 , almost all aspects of the system are well characterized by the @xmath76 product alone .",
    "for example , the formula for the bulk burning rate , @xmath95 for @xmath96 well describes our experimental results .",
    "next , consider the travelling wave solutions shown in fig .",

    "we have also compared the temperature and velocity profiles at the upper and lower apexes of the flame ( fig .",
    "[ fig_walls ] , the top and the bottom panels ) .",
    "the velocity is  as expected  essentially zero well ahead of the temperature front , but significant motion extends far behind it ; the absolute maximum velocity is located in the vicinity of the lower apex and is related to the bulk burning rate ( fig .",
    "[ fig_vmax ] ) . by examing the detailed velocity profiles we find that velocities at the flame front also obey the @xmath76 product scaling and , together with the temperature distribution ,",
    "determine the bulk burning rate .",
    "however , the velocities well behind the front can be quite different for two systems with the same @xmath76 product ( cf .",

    "although the wavelength to laminar front thickness ratio affects small scale features , we again clearly see the similarity scaling connecting these solutions .",
    "=    as we have shown above , the dependence on a single parameter , namely the @xmath76 product , in the infinitely thin front limit follows from dimensional analysis ; and for reasonably thin fronts , we were able to confirm the @xmath76 product scaling .",
    "at the same time , we noticed that the length of the velocity variation , @xmath54 , does not scale with @xmath107 .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that @xmath54 is controlled by the other parameter , namely , the non - dimensional viscosity @xmath108 , which is essentially zero in the thin flame limit .",
    "one can understand this as follows .    from eq .",
    "( [ subeq : omega ] ) , we can see that vorticity is generated in the regions with significant temperature gradients , e.g. , on the scale @xmath53 , and is advected by the flow on spatial scales of order @xmath54 .",

    "=    in other words , in the thin flame limit , vorticity generation depends on the @xmath76 product , but not on the viscosity ; however , in steady state , we know that vorticity generation and destruction must balance exactly . since the vorticity destruction depends on the diffusion term @xmath116 , which decreases as @xmath30 increases , balance can only be achieved if the length of the vorticity diffusion region ( i.e. the separatrix separating adjacent rolls ) lengthens .",

[ fig_interface_similarity ] )  the details on the scale of flame thickness and smaller are consumed by the burning . a similar effect is observed in the rayleigh - taylor instability on the dissipation scale , but due to viscosity and diffusion rather than burning .    =    = 2    the images shown in fig .  [ fig_multi ]",
    "illustrate the propagation of a flame with eight wavelengths ( with @xmath47 , @xmath144 ) within the computational box with reflecting boundary conditions .",
    "the chosen parameters place the system well inside the unstable regime , and , by the time @xmath145 the system forms the curved travelling wave solution with wavelength @xmath47 .",
    "this solution is exactly the same as the curved solution obtained in the half - wavelength computational box , propagates with the same speed , and remains unchanged until time @xmath146 .",
    "( we note that the  wall effect \" seen in this figure reflects both the presence of the walls ( and choice of boundary condition at the walls ) and the choice of phase for the initial perturbation . )",
    "the symmetry of the initial conditions requires zero horizontal velocity at @xmath111 , @xmath147 ; this symmetry constraint is clearly broken for @xmath148 , and the travelling wave solution becomes violently unstable .",
    "the cause of this symmetry breaking is apparently accumulated numerical errors ( noise ) in the calculation .",
    "the source of this noise is the iterative solution for the stream function , so the noise has the wavelength of the computational domain . since perturbations with larger wavelengths move faster , the system will eventually pick the travelling wave configuration corresponding to the largest possible wavelength  in the example shown , the wavelength @xmath102 ( twice the box size ) .    the instability shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_multi ] is not related to metastable behavior near @xmath57 discussed in @xcite  both wavelengths present in the system are unstable for @xmath144 .",
    "rather , this simulation is an illustration of the fact that the small wavelengths have faster initial growth rates , but saturate at lower speeds . as a result ,",
    "the instability exhibits a strong inverse cascade .",
    "more careful modelling of the noise introduced to the system , as well as more realistic treatment of boundary conditions at the walls , will be necessary to learn about the instability dynamics in an infinitely large domain ; in particular , we believe that periodic boundary conditions should be imposed at the walls in order to study this problem further . in such a system we would expect unbounded growth of instability size ; in a natural system we would expect the upper bound to be set by extrinsic spatial scales of the physical system .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the fully nonlinear behavior of diffusive pre - mixed flames in a gravitationally stratified medium , subject to the boussinesq approximation .",
    "our aim was both to compare our results for a viscous system with analytical ( and empirical ) results in the extant literature , and to better understand the phenomenology of fully nonlinear flames subject to gravity .",
    "the essence of our results is that the numerics by and large confirm the markstein and pelc & clavin models , and extend their results to finite viscosity .",
    "we have shown explicitly that there is an extended regime for flames with finite flame front thickness for which the scaling on the @xmath76 product applies ( as it is known to do in the thin flame front limit ) .",
    "we have also examined the details of the flame front structure , and are able to give physically - motivated explanations for the observed scalings , for example , of the flow length scale behind the flame front on prandtl number .    we have also observed a potentially new instability , which arises when noise breaks the symmetry constraint of the initial front perturbation .",
    "our study suggest that this instability differs significantly from finger merging behavior of the non - linear rayleigh - taylor instability , in which the finger merging process resembles a continuous period - doubling phenomenon ( e.g. adjacent fingers at any given generation merge in pairs ) .",
    "in contrast , the instability we observe seems to involve seeding , and strong growth , of modes with wavelengths much larger than the wavelength of the dominant front disturbance .",
    "we are currently investigating this instability in greater detail .",
    "finally , it is of some interest to consider the implication of our results for astrophysical nuclear flames , as arise in the context of white dwarf explosion . using the results of timmes & woosly @xcite",
    ", we find that we would be far into the thin flame limit , with a density jump at the flame front @xmath149 ; hence our boussinesq results are rather marginal in their applicability .",
    "nevertheless , one can ask what the expected flame speed up would be in this limit ; using our results we find that @xmath150 , with @xmath151 . using the length scale of the order of a fraction of white the dwarf radius , @xmath152 , gravitational acceleration on the surface of the star , @xmath153 , and the laminar flame speed given by @xcite , @xmath154",
    ", we obtain @xmath155 , and consequently a speed up of @xmath156 .",
    "smaller laminar flame speeds would lead to the flame velocities independent of the laminar flame speed , @xmath157 , which could be also derived using the rising bubble model @xcite .",
    "evidently , the flame speedup in this limit is very modest .",
    "whether compressibility has much effect on this conclusion remains to be established and is now under active investigation .",
