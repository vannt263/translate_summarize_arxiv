    "the low - energy properties of one - dimensional electron systems are commonly described in the framework of the tomonaga - luttinger liquid theory .",
    "@xcite in this approach the electrons are described in terms of elementary excitations with bosonic statistics , which have the meaning of waves of charge and spin densities .",
    "these waves propagate at different velocities , @xcite resulting in the separation of the charge and spin of the electrons .",
    "a detailed theory of spin - charge separation can be developed in the case of strong repulsive interactions .",
    "this was first accomplished for the one - dimensional hubbard model by ogata and shiba,@xcite who showed that the ground state wave function of the system can be expressed as a product of two separate wave functions describing the charge and spin degrees of freedom .    experimentally , one - dimensional electron systems are often realized in gaas quantum wires.@xcite in contrast to the hubbard model , electrons in quantum wires are not confined to discrete lattice sites , and interact via the long - range coulomb repulsion @xmath0 .",
    "the density of electrons in these systems is easily controlled by gates . at low density",
    "@xmath1 the coulomb repulsion between electrons is much larger than their kinetic energy , and in the ground state the system forms a wigner crystal.@xcite ( here @xmath2 is the bohr radius in the material , @xmath3 is the dielectric constant , and @xmath4 is the effective mass of the electrons . )    this physical picture of strongly interacting one - dimensional electron systems enables a simple description of the charge excitations as phonons in the wigner crystal .",
    "mathematically , they are accounted for by the phonon hamiltonian @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the average interelectron distance , and the @xmath7th electron is described by its momentum @xmath8 and displacement from the equilibrium position @xmath9 .",
    "as long as the displacements @xmath10 are small , the spins are attached to the lattice sites . in order for the spins to move along the crystal",
    ", neighboring electrons must be able to switch places on the wigner lattice .",
    "such processes lead to the exchange coupling of the spins@xcite @xmath11 because the exchange process involves two adjacent electrons tunneling through the strong coulomb barrier , the coupling constant @xmath12 is exponentially small @xmath13 where @xmath14.@xcite    the hamiltonian given by eqs .",

    "resulting in thermal fluctuations of the exchange constant ( [ eq : j ] ) .",
    "this limits the applicability of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_rho ] ) and ( [ eq : spin - chain ] ) to relatively low temperatures , @xmath15 .",

    "as expected , the charge and spin fluctuations described by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : h_rho ] ) and ( [ eq : spin - chain ] ) are decoupled from each other .",

    "a defining characteristic of integrable models is a large number of integrals of motion , which prevents relaxation of the system to equilibrium .",
    "thus , although the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_rho ] ) , ( [ eq : spin - chain ] ) gives an adequate description of the equilibrium properties of the system , corrections to it must be considered in order to discuss the approach to equilibrium .",

    "such corrections fall into three categories .",
    "first , one should note that the wigner crystal is not a perfectly harmonic chain .",

    "( [ eq : j ] ) , which fluctuates as the phonons propagate through the system .",
    "corrections of the third type appear in the spin channel .",
    "similarly to the nearest neighbor exchange coupling ( [ eq : spin - chain ] ) , they are caused by quantum tunneling processes resulting in some electrons changing places on the wigner lattice .",
    "our second goal is to develop a theory of equilibration of a one - dimensional wigner crystal at the lowest temperatures @xmath18 .",
    "the full equilibration of one - dimensional systems is an exponentially slow process , as it requires backscattering of highly excited hole quasiparticles.@xcite in the case of strong interactions the hole becomes a spinon excitation in the spin chain formed on the lattice sites of the wigner crystal , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : spin - chain ] ) . because the typical energy of the spinon @xmath12 is small compared to the fermi energy , the equilibration rate is greatly enhanced in this regime .",
    "it is dominated by the processes of scattering of spinons by the thermal excitations of the system .",
    "the evaluation of the scattering rate relies heavily on the preceding results for the form and magnitude of the integrability - breaking perturbations in the one - dimensional wigner crystal .",
    "we discuss the corrections to the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_rho ] ) , ( [ eq : spin - chain ] ) in sec  [ sec : corrections ] .",

    "[ sec : wkb ] .",

    "thus the wigner crystal limit is achieved at @xmath24 , or at @xmath25 it is worth mentioning that in one dimension quantum fluctuations destroy long - range order even at zero temperature , and the wigner crystal picture refers only to the short - range ordering of electrons .",

    "is preserved .",
    "furthermore , for any state @xmath32 , there are a total of @xmath35 degenerate states obtained from it by all permutations of the coordinates @xmath36 ,  , @xmath37 .",
    "the strongest tunneling process permutes two adjacent particles .",
    "thus , at low energies , the hamiltonian ( [ eq : microscopic_hamiltonian ] ) can be approximated as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the operator of the permutation of the coordinates of the @xmath40th and @xmath41th particles .",

    "the four processes we listed were considered in the case of a quasi - one - dimensional wigner crystal.@xcite the range of electron densities considered there was above the transition from a purely one - dimensional wigner crystal into the zigzag phase .",
