    "there is now strong evidence that the fe  k@xmath0 line emission in some active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and some galactic x - ray binary black - hole candidates ( bhc ) originates , at least in part , from an accretion disk in a strong gravitational field .",
    "a lively debate is aimed at addressing the question of what the spectral line profiles and the associated continuum can tell us about the central black - hole , and whether they can be used to constrain parameters of the accretion disk in a nearby zone , about ten gravitational radii or less from the center . for a recent review for agns , see fabian et al .",

    "there is indication of fe  k@xmath0 line emission from within the last stable orbit of a schwarzschild black hole ( e.g.  in the seyfert galaxy mcg6 - 30 - 15 ; see iwasawa et al .  1996 ; fabian et al .",
    "2000 ; wilms et al .",
    "2001 ; martocchia , matt & karas 2002a ) while in other cases the emission appears to arise farther from the black hole ( e.g.  in the microquasar grs 1915 + 105 , see martocchia et al .",
    "2002b ; for agns , see yaqoob & padmanabhan 2004 and references therein ) .",
    "often , the results from x - ray line spectroscopy are inconclusive , especially in the case of low spectral resolution data . for example , a spinning black hole is allowed but not required by the line model of the microquasar v4641 sgr ( miller et al .",
    "the debate still remains open , but there are good prospects for future x - ray astronomy missions to be able to use the fe  k@xmath0 line to probe the space - time in the vicinity of a black hole , and in particular to measure the angular momentum , or the spin , associated with the metric .",
    "one may also be able to study the ` plunge region ' ( about which very little is known ) , between the event horizon and the last stable orbit , and to determine if any appreciable contribution to the fe  k@xmath0 line emission originates from there ( reynolds & begelman 1997 ; krolik & hawley 2002 ) .",
    "in addition to the fe  k lines , there is some evidence for relativistic _ soft x - ray _ emission lines due to the ly@xmath0 transitions of oxygen , nitrogen , and carbon ( e.g.  mason et al .",
    "2003 ) , although the observational support for this interpretation is still controversial ( e.g.  lee et al .",
    "2001 ) .    with the greatly enhanced spectral resolution and throughput of future x - ray astronomy missions ,",
    "the need arises for realistic theoretical models of the disk emission and computational tools that are powerful enough to deal with complex models and to allow actual fitting of theoretical models to observational data .",
    "it is worth noting that some of the current data have been used to address the issue of distinguishing between different space - time metrics around a black hole , however , the current models available for fitting x - ray data are subject to various restrictions which we shall elaborate on in the present paper .    in this paper",
    "we describe a generalised scheme and a code which can be used with the standard x - ray spectral fitting package , xspec ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "we have in mind general relativity models for black - hole accretion disks . apart from a better numerical resolution ,",
    "the principal innovations compared to currently available schemes are that the new model allows one to ( i )  fit for the black - hole spin , ( ii )  study the emission from the plunge region , and ( iii )  specify a more general form of emissivity as a function of polar coordinates in the disk plane ( both for the line and for the continuum ) .",
    "furthermore , it is also possible to ( iv )  study time variability of the observed signal and ( v )  compute stokes parameters of a polarized signal . items ( i)(iii ) are immediately applicable to current data and modelling , while the last two mentioned features are still mainly of theoretical interest at present .",
    "time - resolved analysis and polarimetry of accretion disks are directed towards future applications when the necessary resolution and the ability to do polarimetry are available in x - rays .",
    "thus our code has the advantage that it can be used with time - resolved data for reverberation studies of relativistic accretion disks ( stella 1990 ; reynolds et al .  1999 ; ruszkowski 2000 ; goyder & lasenby 2004 ) . also polarimetric analysis can be performed , and this will be extremely useful because it can add very specific information on strong - gravitational field effects ( connors , stark & piran 1980 ; matt , fabian & ross 1993 ; bao et al .",
    "theoretical spectra with temporal and polarimetric information can be analysed with the current version of our code and such analysis should provide tighter constrains on future models than is currently possible .",
    "as mentioned above , fe  k lines have been reported in the x - ray spectra of numerous agns and bhcs .",
    "these sources frequently exhibit remarkable variability patterns which are still difficult to understand . among these puzzling objects ,",
    "the seyfert  1 galaxy mcg6 - 30 - 15 is radically distinctive with its broad and skewed fe  k@xmath0 feature that persists in observations in spite of substantial variablity of the continuum .",
    "interpretation of the fe  k line in terms of reflection from a relativistic black - hole disk has been found to be rather robust , but it has not been possible to fully explore the model parameter space . in particular , constraints on @xmath1",
    "have only been obtained by fitting ` inverted photon data ' which is made from the real data in a model - dependent way that already assumes a certain value of @xmath1 .",
    "the puzzling stability of this line has been attributed , amongst other things , to general relativity effects very close to the black hole ( miniutti et al .",
    "2003 ; fabian & vaughan 2003 ) .",
    "it is thus interesting to know if and how a generalisation of the standard disk - line scheme together with accurate computation of general relativistic effects can add new pieces of information or whether a more substantial modification of the whole picture is needed ( for further discussion and references , see e.g.weaver & yaqoob 1998 ; krolik 1999 ; hartnoll & blackman 2001 ; dumont et al .",
    "2002 ) . different kinds of such generalisations have been proposed .",
    "previous papers indicated that details of the model do matter .",
    "however , a strong gravitational field has almost invariably been required . in the present paper",
    ", we adopt the assumption that the line and continuum emission are produced by an irradiated disk near a rotating black hole , we relax some of the previous assumptions , and we search for best - fitting parameters of the model .    in the   2 we describe the main features of the new computational tool .",
    "we list several variants of the code which address different problems of fitting x - ray spectra of black hole plus accretion disk systems . in ",
    "3 we use the code to analyse time - averaged data for mcg6 - 30 - 15 _ xmm  newton _ ccd data as detailed in fabian et al.2002 ) .",
    "we point out that more complex models may not require a large value of the black - hole angular momentum , although the current data are consistent with a maximally rotating black hole . finally , in   4 , we summarise our results and state our conclusions .",

    "the new model , ky , is suited for use with the xspec package ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "several mutations of ky were developed , with an eye to specifically provide different applications , and linked with a common ray - tracing subroutine , which therefore does not have to be touched when the intrinsic ( local ) emissivity function in the model is changed .",
    "when the relativistic line distortions are computed , the new model is more accurate than the laor model ( laor 1991 ) and faster than kerrspec ( martocchia , karas & matt  2000 ) .",
    "these are the other two xspec models with a similar usage ( see also pariev & bromley 1998 ; gierliski , maciolek - niedzwiecki & ebisawa 2001 ; schnittman & bertschinger 2003 ) .",
    "it is also important to compare the results from fully independent relativistic codes since the calculations are sufficiently complex that significant differences can arise .",
    "our code is more general than the currently available alternatives in xspec , so it can be used to assess the shortcomings of the available codes . we compared calculated profiles of the relativistic line in our model with several models available in literature .",
    "in particular , our time - averaged profiles are in perfect agreement with those shown in beckwith & done ( preprint , 2004 ) .",
    "small ( but potentially significant ) distinctions from other models can be explained by omission of light - focusing effect in diskline and by insufficient resolution in the laor model .",
    "the discrepancies become more prominent in extreme situations of large inclination and/or very narrow ring . furthermore , as discussed in the text below , various uncertainties in the form of intrinsic emissivity and especially in the darkening law introduce changes in spectrum which could not be examined by older models . for more comparisons",
    "see appendix  [ appa ] .",
    "as far as the continuum component is concerned , an approximation was adopted in order to account for compton reflection . to this end",
    ", we employ a more basic approach than the pexrav model ( magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) .",
    "simplicity of the adopted scheme affords a much higher computation speed than other compton reflection models in xspec .",
    "further details of the method and the calculations for the ray - tracing are given in appendix  [ appa ] , and details of the compton reflection model we use are given in appendix  [ appb ] ( see also doviak et al .",
    "2004 ) .    among its useful features ,",
    "the ky model allows one to fit various parameters such as black - hole angular momentum ( @xmath1 ) , observer inclination angle relative to the disk axis ( @xmath8 ) , and the size and shape of the emission area on the disk , which can be non - axisymmetric ( see table  [ tab : models ] for a summary of the basic features ) .",
    "a straightforward modification of a single subroutine suffices to alter the prescription for the disk emissivity , which is specified either by an analytical formula or in a tabular form .",
    "our code allows one to change the mesh spacing and resolution for the ( two - dimensional ) polar grid that covers the disk plane , as well as the energy vector ( the output resolution is eventually determined by the detector in use when the model is folded through the instrument response ) .",
    "hence , there is sufficient control of the ( improved ) accuracy and computational speed .",
    "furthermore , ky can be run as a stand - alone program ( detached from xspec ) . in this mode",
    "there is an option for time - variable sources such as orbiting spots , spiral waves or evolving flares ( e.g.  czerny et al .",
    "2004 , who applied a similar approach to compute the predicted rms variability in a specific flare / spot model ) . the improved accuracy of the new model has been achieved in several ways : ( i )  photon rays are integrated in kerr ingoing coordinates which follow principal photons , ( ii )  simultaneous integration of the geodesic deviation equations ensures accurate evaluation of the lensing effect , and ( iii )  non - uniform and rather fine grids have been carefully selected .    a new and efficient code has been desirable in order to be able to perform spectral fits with sufficient accuracy and to deal with non - axisymmetric geometry of accretion flows . also",
    ", obscuration effects along the line - of - sight need to be taken into account , as well as the effects of relativity which act on photons , as they propagate through curved spacetime towards a distant observer . a reasonable trade - off",
    "must be achieved between mathematically elegant approaches ( as initiated by de felice , nobili & calvani 1974 , and cunningham 1975 ) and straightforward numerical ray - tracing of a sufficiently huge number of photons ( karas , vokrouhlick & polnarev 1992 ; bromley , chen & miller 1997 ) .",
    "the former method is less flexible as far as the source geometry is concerned . on the other hand",
    ", the latter method is computationally demanding ( this problem can be partly solved by analytical integration of the rays in terms of elliptical integrals , which is amenable in the kerr metric , but only at cost of substantial complexity of the resulting code ; cf .",
    "martocchia et al .",
    "2000 ; ade et al .",
    "2003 ) . various strategies and approximations have been developed by different authors ( asaoka 1989 ; laor 1991 ; kojima 1991 ; bao , hadrava & stgaard 1994 ; dabrowski & lasenby 2001 ; fanton et al .",
    "1997 ; matt et al .",
    "1993a , b ; semerk , karas & de  felice 1999 ; viergutz 1991 ; zakharov 1994 ) . taking into account the practical experience with various approaches",
    ", we optimised the new routines with respect to rather antagonistic requirements on speed , accuracy , generality and flexibility .",
    "several versions of the routine have been prefabricated for different types of sources ( table  [ tab : versions ] ) : ( i )  an intrinsically narrow line produced by a disk , ( ii )  a relativistically blurred compton - reflection continuum including a primary power - law component , ( iii )  the lamp - post model emissivity ( martocchia et al .",
    "2000 ) , and ( iv ) time - dependent spectrum of an orbiting or a free - falling spot .",
    "default parameter values for the line model correspond to those in the laor model , but numerous options have been added .",
    "for example , in the new model one is able to set the emission inner radius below the marginally stable orbit , @xmath9 .",
    "one can also allow @xmath1 to vary independently , in which case the horizon radius , @xmath10 , has to be , and indeed is , updated at each step of the fit procedure .",
    "we thus define emission radii in terms of their offset from the horizon .",
    "several arguments have been advocated in favour of having @xmath11 for the disk emission , but this possibility has never been tested rigorously against observational data .",
    "the set of ky - routines introduced above provide the tools to explore black - hole disk models and to actually fit for their key parameters , namely , @xmath1 , @xmath8 , and @xmath12 .",
    "let us remind the reader that , apart from the model parameters which are subject to fitting , one may also specify the functional form of intrinsic emissivity of the disk as a function of polar coordinates and photon energy .",
    "as an example , an time - independent intrinsic emissivity @xmath13 was convolved with our ray - tracing routine to produce a power - law type continuum component with relativistic effects .",
    "compton reflection was taken into account for intrinsic emissivity in the same approximation as adopted in the ( non - relativistic ) model hrefl .",
    "the spectrum of the resulting relativistic model , kyhrefl , therefore resembles the outcome of a multiplicative model , hrefl*powerlaw in xspec , which has been blurred by the relativistic disk kernel .",
    "it is worth noting that the effect of general relativity is practically negligible in the case of a locally power - law continuum because of the overall smearing of the spectrum across the disk surface .",
    "a non - trivial part in kyhrefl therefore concerns the compton reflection component and its mutual normalization with respect to the primary powerlaw originating at different radii in the disk .",
    "we have also produced a convolution - type model , kyconv , which can be applied to any existing xspec model of intrinsic x - ray emission ( naturally , a meaningful combination of the models is the responsibility of the user ) .",
    "we remind the reader that kyconv is substantially more powerful than the usual convolution models in xspec , which are defined in terms of one - dimensional integration over energy bins . despite the fact that kyconv still uses the standard xspec syntax in evaluating the observed spectrum ( e.g.  kyconv(powerlaw ) )",
    ", our code performs a more complex operation .",
    "it still performs ray - tracing across the disk surface , so the intrinsic model contributions are integrated from different radii .",
    "the price that one has to pay for the enhanced functionality is a higher demand for computational power .    as mentioned above ,",
    "time - dependent spectra are expected to eliminate a great deal of uncertainty in studying accretion disks ( e.g.  done & gierliski 2003 ) . as an example of using ky outside of xspec , fig .",
    "[ fig : example2 ] represents an evolving spectral line in a dynamical diagram : a localized spot , free - falling from the marginally stable orbit down towards the black - hole horizon .",
    "intrinsic emissivity is assumed to fade gradually with the distance from the spot centre , with characteristic diameter of the spot @xmath14 ( @xmath15 in kyspot ) , but it is kept constant in time . therefore the figure reflects the effect of changing energy shift along the spot trajectory .",
    "the in - spiral motion starts just below the marginally stable orbit and it proceeds down to the horizon , maintaining the specific energy and angular momentum of its initial circular orbit .",
    "one can easily recognise that variations in redshift could hardly be recovered from data if only time - averaged spectrum were available .",
    "in particular , the motion above @xmath16 near a rapidly spinning black hole is difficult to distinguish from a descent below @xmath17 in the non - rotating case .",
    "before time - resolved spectra are available with sufficient quality , preliminary considerations can be based on the extremal values , and the range , of energy shift , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , as well as the relative time delay which photons experience when arriving at the observer s location from different parts of the disk .",
    "this is particularly relevant for some narrow lines whose redshift can be determined more accurately than if the line is broad ( e.g.  turner et al .",
    "2002 ; guainazzi 2003 ; yaqoob et al .",
    "careful discussion of @xmath20 can , in principle , circumvent the uncertainties which are introduced by uncertain form of the intrinsic emissivity of the disk and yet still constrain some of parameters .",
    "advantages of this technique were pointed out already by cunningham ( 1975 ) and it was further developed by pariev , bromley & miller ( 2001 ) .",
    "[ fig : g_minmax ] shows the extremal values of the redshift factor for @xmath21 ( which often seems to be preferred by the observational data ) .",
    "these were computed along @xmath22 circles in the disk plane , together with the corresponding contour lines of @xmath23 in the plane @xmath1 versus @xmath24 . in other words ,",
    "radiation is supposed to originate from radius @xmath24 in the disk , but it experiences a different redshift depending on the polar angle .",
    "contours of the redshift factor provide a very useful and straightforward technique to determine the position of a flare or a spot , provided that a narrow spectral line is produced and measured with sufficient accuracy",
    ". the most direct use of extremal @xmath25-values would be , if one were able to measure variations of the line profile from its lowest - energy excursion ( for @xmath19 ) and highest - energy excursion ( for @xmath18 ) , i.e.  over a complete cycle .",
    "even partial information can help to constrain models ( for example , the count rate is expected to dominate the observed line at the time that @xmath26 , and so the high - energy peak is easier to detect ) . while it is very difficult to achieve sufficient precision on the highly shifted and damped red wing of a broad line , prospects for using narrow lines is indeed interesting ,",
    "provided that they originate close enough to the black hole and that sufficient resolution is achieved both in the energy and time domains .",
    "[ fig : g_minmax ] also makes it clear that it is possible in principle ( but intricate in practice ) to deduce the @xmath1-parameter value from spectra .",
    "it can be seen from the redshift factor that the dependence on @xmath1 is rather small and it quickly becomes negligible if the light from the source is dominated by contributions from @xmath27 .",
    "for example , setting @xmath28 and @xmath21 , one finds that the relative difference between @xmath29 and @xmath30 amounts to only @xmath31 .",
    "a similar value comes out for @xmath19 , and this also roughly corresponds to the precision which is needed in order to be able to reveal the effect of black hole rotation .",
    "notice , however , that this is in principle achievable by the _ chandra _ gratings and the _ astro  e2 _ calorimeter .",
    "it may also be achievable by _ xmm  newton _ with high signal - to - noise data , and of course the effect would be more pronounced in case of a source seen edge - on .",
    "other user - defined emissivities can be easily adopted .",
    "this can be achieved either by using the convolution component kyconv or by adding a new user - defined model to xspec .",
    "the latter method is more flexible and faster , and hence recommended . in both approaches ,",
    "the ray - tracing routine is linked and used for relativistic blurring .",
    "naturally , by adding new emissivity laws one invariably introduces additional freedom ( for example , the height @xmath32 of the primary source in the lamp - post model ) .",
    "it is worth repeating that caution is always necessary because the predictive power of the model rapidly decays with the number of parameters .",
    "we conclude this section by summarizing the way of using the new model : time - dependent spectra are computed by specifying the photon numbers emitted from the disk , @xmath33 , where @xmath24 and @xmath34 are polar coordinates in the disk plane , @xmath35 is cosine of the emission angle with respect to the disk normal , @xmath36 is boyer - lindquist time in the kerr metric , and @xmath37 comes out in @xmath38 .",
    "naturally , mean spectra represent a special case in which time dependence of the source emissivity is not considered .",

    "2002 ) is that there is not an emission line at @xmath107  kev , but he - like resonance absorption at @xmath108  kev .",
    "this would not affect our conclusions .",

    "weak constraints on @xmath43 and @xmath113 are actually expected in this model for two reasons .",
    "firstly , in these data the continuum is indeed rather featureless .",
    "secondly , the model continuum was blurred with the relativistic kernel of kyhrefl , and so the dependence of the final spectrum on the exact form of emissivity distribution over the disk must be quite weak .    _ model # 1 .",
    "_ using a model with a plain power - law radial emissivity on the disk , we obtained the best - fitting values for the following set of parameters : @xmath1 of the black hole , disk inclination angle @xmath8 , radii of the line - emitting region , @xmath115 , the corresponding radial emissivity power - law index @xmath0 of the line emission , as well as the radial extent of the continuum - emitting region , its photon index @xmath42 , and the corresponding @xmath43 for the continuum .",

    "a model which is over - parameterized is undesirable from the point of view of deriving unique model parameters from modeling the data .",

    "the latter implies that some model parameters can never be constrained uniquely , regardless of the quality of the data . in practice",
    "one must apply both interpretations and assess the approach case by case , taking into account the quality of the data , and which parameters can be constrained by the data and which can not . if preliminary fitting shows that large changes in a parameter do not affect the fit , then that parameter can be fixed at some value obtained by invoking physically reasonable arguments pertaining to the situation .",
    "we performed various fits with the inner edge tied to the marginally stable orbit and also fits where @xmath12 was allowed to vary independently .",
    "free - fall motion with constant angular momentum was assumed below @xmath116 , if the emitting region extended that far .",
    "table  [ tab : best - fit - models ] gives best - fitting values of the key relativistic line and continuum model parameters for the case in which @xmath12 and @xmath1 were independent .",
    "next , we froze some of the parameters at their best - fit values and examined the @xmath117 space by varying the remaining free parameters . that way we constructed joint confidence contours in the plane @xmath1 versus @xmath8",

    "_ model # 2 .",
    "_ we explored the possibility that the broad - line emission does not conform to a unique power - law radial emissivity but that , instead , the line is produced in two concentric rings ( a ` dual - ring ' model ) .",
    "this case can be considered as a toy model for a more complex ( non - power law ) radial dependence of the line emission than the standard monotonic decline , which we represent here by allowing for different values of @xmath0 in the inner and outer rings : @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "effectively , large values of the power law index represent two separate rings .",
    "the two regions are matched at the transition radius , @xmath119 , and so this is essentially a broken power law .",

    "2000 ) in which the disk irradiation and the resulting fe  k@xmath0 reflection are substantially anisotropic due to fast orbital motion in the inner ring .",
    "although the lamp - post model is very simplified in several respects , namely the way in which the primary source is set up on the rotation axis , one can expect fairly similar irradiation to arise from more sophisticated schemes of coronal flares distributed above the disk plane . also , in order to provide a physical picture of the steep emissivity found in _",

    "intense self - irradiation of the inner disk may further contribute to the effect .",
    "this more complex model is consistent with the findings of fabian et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . indeed",
    ", the fit is improved relative to models with a simple emissivity law because the enormous red wing and relatively sharp core of the line are better reproduced thanks to the contribution from a highly redshifted inner disk ( see table  [ tab : best - fit - models ] , model  # 2a ) .",
    "for the same reason that the more complex model reproduces the line core along with the red wing well , the model prefers higher values of @xmath1 and @xmath8 than what we found for the case # 1 .",
    "notice that @xmath120 implies that all radiation is produced above @xmath116 .",
    "maximum rotation is favoured with both @xmath1 and @xmath8 appearing to be tightly constrained near their best - fit values .",
    "likewise for the continuum radial emissivity indices .",
    "there is a certain freedom in the parameter values that can be accomodated by this model . by scanning the remaining parameters",
    ", we checked that the reduced @xmath121 can be achieved also for @xmath1 going down to @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "this conclusion is also consistent with the case for large @xmath1 in dabrowski et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ; however we actually do not support the claim that the current data _ require _ a large value of @xmath1 .",
    "as shown below , reasonable assumptions about intrinsic emissivity can fit the data with small @xmath1 equally well .",
    "in model # 2a , small residuals remain near @xmath124  kev ( at about the @xmath125% level ) , the origin of which can not easily be clarified with the time - averaged data that we employ now .",
    "the excess is reminiscent of a doppler horn typical of relativistic line emission from a disk , so it may also be due to fe  k@xmath0 emission which is locally enhanced on some part of the disk .",
    "we were able to reproduce the peak by modifying the emissivity at the transition radius , where the broken power - law emissivity changes its slope ( model  # 2b ) .",
    "we can even allow non - zero emissivity below @xmath116 ( the inner ring ) with a gap of zero emissivity between the outer edge of the inner ring and the inner edge of the outer one .",
    "the inner ring , @xmath126 , contributes to the red tail of the line while the outer ring , @xmath127 , forms the main body of the broad line .",
    "the resulting plot of joint confidence contours of @xmath8 versus @xmath1 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : confcont1 ] ( right panel ) in order to construct the confidence contours we scanned a broad interval of parameters , @xmath128 and @xmath129 ; here , detail is shown only around the minimum @xmath117 region .",
    "two examples of the spectral profiles are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dualline3 - 10kev_v3 ] .",
    "it can be seen that the overall shapes are very similar and the changes concern mainly the red wing of the profile . for completeness",
    "we also fitted several modifications of the model # 2 and found that with this type of disk emissivity ( i.e.one which does not decrease monotonically with radius ) we can still achieve comparably good fits which have small values of @xmath1 .",
    "the case # 2c in table  [ tab : best - fit - models ] gives another example .",
    "this shows that one can not draw firm conclusions about @xmath1 ( and some of the other model parameters ) based on the redshifted part of the line using current data .",
    "the data used here represent the highest signal - to - noise relativistically broadened fe k line profile yet available for any agn .",
    "the differences in @xmath117 between model # 1 and models # 2a , 2b , and 2c are very large ( @xmath130 ) for only one additional free parameter , so all variations of model 2 shown are better fits than the case # 1 .",
    "we note that formally , model # 2a and # 2c appear to constrain @xmath1 much more tightly than model # 1 .",
    "the issue here is that the values of @xmath1 can be completely different , with the statistical errors on @xmath1 not overlapping ( compare , for example , model # 2a and # 2c in table  [ tab : best - fit - models ] ) .",
    "this demonstrates that , at least for the parameter @xmath1 , it is not simply the statistical error only which determines whether a small @xmath1 value is or is not allowed by the data .",
    "we confirmed this conclusion with more complicated models obtained in ky by relaxing the assumption of axial symmetry ; additional degrees of freedom do not change the previous results .",
    "one should bear in mind a well - known technical difficulty which is frequently encountered while scanning the parameter space of complex models and producing confidence contour plots similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : confcont1 ] .",
    "that is , in a rich parameter space the procedure may be caught in a local minimum which produces an acceptable statistical measure of the goodness of fit and appears to tightly constrain parameters near the best - fitting values . however , manual searching revealed equally acceptable results in rather remote parts of the parameter space . indeed , as the results above show , we were able to find acceptable fits with the central black hole rotating either slowly or rapidly ( in terms of the @xmath1 parameter ) .",
    "this fact is not in contradiction with previous results ( e.g.  fabian et al .",
    "2002 ) because we assumed a different radial profile of intrinsic emissivity , but it indicates intricacy of unambiguous determination of model parameters .",
    "we therefore need more observational constraints on realistic physical mechanisms to be able to fit complicated models to actual data with sufficient confidence ( ballantyne , ross & fabian 2001 ; nayakshin & kazanas 2002 ; raska et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "we have seen that the models described above are able to constrain parameters with rather different degrees of uncertainty .",
    "it turns out that the more complex type # 2 models ( i.e.  those that have radial emissivity profiles which are non - monotonic or even have an appreciable contribution from @xmath131 ) provide better fits to the data but a physical interpretation is not obvious .",
    "ballantyne , vaughan & fabian ( 2003 ) also deduce a dual - reflector model from the same data and propose that the outer reflection is due to the disk being warped or flared with increasing radius .",
    "we have presented an extended computational scheme which can be conveniently employed to examine predicted x - ray spectral features from black - hole accretion disks . as mentioned above",
    ", a one - dimensional version of the code basically reproduces previous methods , with the addition of the option to vary more parameters ( e.g.  @xmath1 ) .",
    "the current two - dimensional version also accomodates non - axisymmetric and time - evolving emissivity from a geometrically thin disk .",
    "the new tool facilitates accurate comparisons between model spectra and actual data .",
    "it provides also polarimetric information .",
    "one can even substitute other tables for the kerr metric tables to explore different specetime .",
    "however , we defer detailed discussion of these latter capabilities to a future paper .",
    "furthermore , work is in progress to include realistic emissivities relevant to different physical situations , in order to allow for the intrinsically three - dimensional geometry of the sources ( e.g.  an optically - thin corona above the disk ) , and to parallelize the code .",
    "recently , several research groups have embarked on projects to compare theoretical predictions of intrinsic emissivity of accretion disks with observational data obtained by x - ray satellites .",
    "this approach offers a fascinating opportunity to explore processes near black - hole sources , both agns and bhcs , and to estimate physical parameters of black holes themselves . in order to limit the number of unknown model parameters and to alleviate the computational burden of the fit procedure ,",
    "simplifications on the model emissivity ( for example , stationarity and/or axial symmetry ) have been often imposed .",
    "naturally , fitting data with complex models is computationally more demanding .    to summarize",
    ", we have illustrated the code by following common practice and employing minimisation of @xmath117 to find the best - fitting parameter values for the highest signal - to - noise fe k line profile available to date  from the _ xmm  newton _ campaign of the seyfert  1 galaxy mcg6 - 30 - 15 .",
    "the new model can vary more of the parameters than previous variants of the disk - line scheme allowed , which seems to be necessary in view of the fact that simple prescriptions for intrinsic emisivity ( axisymmetric , radially monotonic , etc . ) are not adequate to reflect realistic simulations of accretion flows .",
    "it is without much surprise that a complex model exhibits an intricate @xmath117 space in which ambiguities arise with multiple islands of acceptable parameters .",
    "the mean _ xmm  newton _ spectrum of mcg6 - 30 - 15 analyzed here justifies rejection of the often - used plain power - law emissivity that depends solely on radius from the black hole .",
    "however , we can not arbitrate the issue of non - monotonic emissivity versus a non - axisymmetric one . due to the inherent degeneracy in time - averaged spectra",
    ", both alternatives can reproduce these data with reasonable parameters .",
    "in other words , @xmath1 of the black hole can not be unambiguously determined if complex ( realistic ) emissivities are adopted .",
    "it is clear that the relativistic line profiles affected by strong gravity are such that it is very difficult to recover unambiguous information about the key parameters , such as black - hole spin , disk inclination angle , and inner disk radius .",
    "this is because even with increased throughput , energy resolution and signal - to - noise , the smooth , featureless tails of the time - averaged line profiles do not retain sufficient information to break the degeneracies between the dependences on the black - hole , accretion disk , and line emissivity parameters .",
    "higly specific spectral shapes could actually be provided by contributions to the line profile from higher - order images , whose form inherits unique information about space - time of the black hole .",
    "it may appear rather unlikely that higher - order images could be discovered in spectra of agns , because this would require to see an unobscured inner disk at large ( almost edge - on ) inclination .",
    "as the data improve , the important measurable quantities that will constrain parameters when compared with the models are : ( i )  the slope of the red wing , ( ii )  the energy of the cut - off of the blue side of the line profile , and ( iii )  the detailed shape of the blue peak ( see figs .  [ fig : example0][fig : example3 ] and further discussion in the appendix ) . the extreme part of the red wing will not be as useful because it will always be difficult to tell where the line emission joins the continuum no matter how good the data are , and also because there is often no prominent sharp feature in the red wing since the red doppler peak is too smeared out when the line emission extends too close to the black hole .",
    "in addition , time variability will be extremely important .",
    "no matter how , or if , the line emission responds to the continuum , we know that the disk inclination and black - hole spin very likely do not change during different snapshots",
    ". therefore any differences in the snapshot line profiles must be due only to changes in the line emissivity , in terms of its radial and azimuthal distribution and/or its radial extent ( @xmath12 and @xmath114 ) .",
    "combining these approaches and collecting enough snapshots may provide sufficient information to uniquely determine one of the parameters , such as black - hole spin .",

    "geometrical optics is adequate to formulate the ray tracing problem in rigorous manner ( schneider , ehlers & falco 1992 ) .",

    "four - momentum of each photon is parallely transported along the ray . on a practical side , to achieve fast computations of observed spectra and for data fitting we produced accurate tables describing the kerr metric , ray - tracing equations and the equations of geodesic deviation .",
    "these were solved in well - behaved coordinates .",
    "this choice allows one to map the whole region , from the outer edge of the disk down to the black hole horizon , where dragging effects are prominent . also , caustics can play a role for large inclination ( rauch & blandford 1994 ) . when integration of light rays is accomplished , we transform results back to boyer - lindquist coordinates , so that the intrinsic emissivity of the disc can be conveniently defined as a function of @xmath24 , @xmath34 and @xmath36 in the disk plane . here",
    "we briefly summarise the adopted approach .",
    "the source appears as a point - like object for a distant observer , so that the observer actually measures the flux entering the solid angle @xmath132 , which is associated with the detector area @xmath133 ( this relation defines the distance @xmath134 ) .",
    "we denote total photon flux received by a detector , @xmath135 where @xmath136 is local photon flux at the disk , @xmath137 is the number of photons with energy in interval @xmath138 and @xmath139 is the redshift factor .",
    "note that @xmath140 may vary over the disk , change in time , and it can also depend on the emission angle ( for the sake of brevity of formulae , we do not always write this dependence explicitly ) .",
    "the emission arriving in solid angle @xmath141 originates from area @xmath142 on the disk .",
    "hence , in our computations we want to integrate the flux contributions over a fine mesh on the disk surface .",
    "to this aim , we adjust eq .",
    "( [ flux ] ) to the form @xmath143 here @xmath144 denotes an element of area on the disk perpendicular to light rays ( corresponding to the solid angle @xmath145 in flat space - time ) , and @xmath146 stands for area in boyer - lindquist coordinates lying in the disk plane from which photons are emitted . the integrated flux per unit solid angle is @xmath147 where @xmath148 is time coordinate corrected for the light - time effect , @xmath149 is the lensing factor in the limit @xmath150 ( keeping @xmath151 constant ) , @xmath152 is the cosine of the local emission angle , @xmath153 is proper area at the disk perpendicular to light rays and corresponding to @xmath154 . in eq .",
    "( [ nobs ] ) we used transformation of the proper area element , @xmath155 , @xmath156 finally , @xmath157 is the output of the model computations .    in eq .",
    "( [ nobs]),@xmath158 is a normalization constant of the model . for line emission",
    ", normalization is chosen in such a way that the total flux from the disk is unity . in the case of a continuum model ,",
    "the flux is normalized to unity at certain value of observed energy ( typically at @xmath159  kev , as in other xspec models ) .",
    "notice that default normalization has been changed in figs.[fig : example0][fig : example3 ] for the sake of clarity .",
    "we employed the bulirsch - stoer method for numerical integration .",
    "four sets of data tables were pre - computed and stored with the necessary information about photons received from different regions of the source . specifically , separate tables hold information on ( i )  the energy shift ( @xmath25-factor , or the ratio of energy of a  photon received by an observer at infinity to the intrinsic energy when emitted at the disk ) , ( ii )  the lensing effect ( the ratio @xmath160 of the area subtended by photons at infinity , perpendicular to light rays through which photons arrive at the detector , to the area on the disk from where these photons originate ) , ( iii )  the mutual delay of the photons arriving at the observer s location ( i.e.  relative time lags @xmath161 ) , and ( iv )  the local emission direction @xmath35 with respect to the disk normal ( evaluated in the disk co - rotating frame ) .",
    "the problem of directional distribution of the reflected radiation is quite complicated and the matter has not been completely settled yet ( e.g.  george & fabian 1991 ; ghisellini , haardt & matt 1994 ; ycki & czerny 1994 ; magdziarz & zdiarski 1995 ) . a specific angular dependence is often assumed in models , such as the limb - darkening in laor xspec model , @xmath162 .",
    "however , it has been argued that limb - brightening may actually occur in the case of strong primary irradiation of the disk , and this is relevant for accretion disks near black holes where the effects of emission anisotropy are crucial ( czerny et al .",
    "we find that the spectrum of the inner disk turns out to be very sensitive to the adopted angular dependence of the emission , and so the possibility to modify this profile and examine the results using ky appears to be rather useful ( we set locally isotropic emission as default ) .",
    "impact of the darkening law on the reflection spectrum is connected with the assumed rotation law of the disk material .",
    "as mentioned above , we assumed keplerian circular motion for @xmath163 .",
    "for @xmath131 we assumed free - fall trajectories , maintaining constant orbital energy and angular momentum .",
    "all data tables are stored in fits format and loaded in memory only once , when the routine is initiated .",
    "examples of the contents of the data tables , illustrating the effects of frame - dragging , are shown in figures  [ fig : example6a][fig : example6b ] for given choices of @xmath1 and @xmath8 .",
    "the graphs represent a top view of the equatorial plane , each one on four different spatial scales . in practice",
    "we have chosen @xmath164 ( boyer - lindquist radius ) as a maximum outer limit of the disk , but the most dramatic dependences on , for example @xmath1 , happen much closer to the horizon . in the upper left panels of figs .",
    "[ fig : example6a ] and [ fig : example6b ] we define the radial coordinate in a different way to that in the other panels .",
    "specifically , we use @xmath165 .",
    "the use of @xmath166 brings the horizon to the origin so that the region just outside it is well resolved in the plots that show the region closest to the black hole . in these graphs ,",
    "the observer is located at the top of the pictures with an inclination angle of @xmath167 relative to the rotation axis .",
    "the marginally stable orbit is also shown ( drawn as a circle ) where relevant .    despite the fact that the particular choice of the graphical representation is a technicality to certain extent , we find these kinds of graphs useful for quick estimations of the expected range of energy shifts , fluctuations of radiation flux , time delay effects etc .",
    "for example , we notice that with the adopted ( typical ) value of @xmath21 , the lensing can not account for more than a few percent effect on observed count rates .",
    "lensing , however , becomes important for edge - on orientation of the disk , as can be seen from the tables with larger values of @xmath8 .",
    "we therefore arranged a systematic atlas of the tables for different values of angular momentum and observer inclination .",
    "further , we produced their transformation from boyer - lindquist @xmath168 to kerr ingoing coordinates ( in which the effect of frame dragging is largely eliminated ) , and the same for other relevant quantities ( time delay and the emission angle in the disk ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that different space - time metric and the disk rotation law can be accomodated simply by replacing the data tables .",
    "also , transfer of stokes parameters can be computed , and to this aim we computed data tables which are needed for polarimetry in strong gravity . however",
    ", this discussion remains beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "results of an elementary code test are shown in figures  [ fig : example0][fig : example3 ] .",
    "the intrinsic emissivity was assumed to be a narrow gaussian line ( width @xmath169ev ) with the amplitude decreasing @xmath170 in the local frame co - moving with the disk medium .",
    "no background continuum is included here , so these lines can be compared with similar pure disk - line profiles obtained in previous papers ( e.g.  laor 1991 ; kojima 1991 ) which also imposed the assumption of axially symmetric and steady emission from an irradiated thin disk .",
    "again , the intrinsic width of the line is assumed to be much less than the effects of broadening due to bulk keplerian motion and the central gravitational field .",
    "furthermore , figures  [ fig : example4][fig : example5 ] compare model spectra of widely used xspec models .",
    "typically , the slope of the low - energy wing is rather sensitive do the radial dependence of emissivity .",
    "notice also that the laor model gives zero contribution at energy below @xmath171kev and its grid has only @xmath172 radial points distributed in the whole range @xmath173 .",
    "therefore , in spite of very efficient interpolation and smoothing of the final spectrum , the laor model does not accurately reproduce the line originating from a narrow ring .",
    "also , dependence on the limb darkening / brightening can not be examined with this model , because the form of directionality of the intrinsic emission is hard - wired in the code , together with the position of the inner edge at @xmath163 .",
    "the diskline model has been also used frequently in the context of spectral fitting , assuming a disk around a non - rotating black hole .",
    "this model is analytical , and so it has clear advantages in xspec .",
    "notice , however , that the lensing effect is neglected .",
    "all this affects especially the spectrum near the black hole , where radiation is expected to be very anisotropic and flow lines non - circular .",
    "in this appendix we describe the compton - reflection model hrefl . this model has been a part of the xspec distribution for some time .",
    "we have used similar approximation for the compton - reflection in the disk to produce the relativistic version , kyhrefl .",
    "the model has similar features to the well - known pexrav model ( magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) , which can often be prohibitively slow .",
    "there is a need for a fast reflection code for spectral fitting purposes , since the energy resolution of x - ray spectral data has been improved considerably in the last few years . also , when convolving the reflection continuum with a kernel for relativistic energy shifting , computation speed is a critical factor .",
    "the price to pay is that hrefl makes use of a number of simplifying approximations .",
    "one of these is the elastic scattering approximation .",
    "still , hrefl is accurate enough to be used for modelling data from observations of low - redshift sources with _ asca _ , _ chandra _ , and _ xmm  newton _ , where the source - frame spectrum does not extend beyond @xmath174  kev .",
    "( notice , however , that this condition may be violated if the redshift of received photons is very large , e.g.  near a black - hole horizon . )",
    "another advantage of hrefl is that the model is completely analytic , and this is one of the major factors which makes it fast .",
    "below we give an outline of the model , providing important details of the adopted approximations , and a direct comparison with the pexrav model .",
    "a general description of the approach can be found in basko ( 1978 ) along with any standard radiative transfer textbooks ( e.g.  chandrasekhar 1960 ) .",
    "let us consider a point source situated at a height @xmath32 above the center of an optically - thick disk with inner and outer radii @xmath12 and @xmath114 respectively .",
    "we define the cosines of the angles between the disk axis and lines connecting the inner and outer radii to the source as @xmath175 and @xmath176 respectively , where @xmath177 the parameters actually required by the hrefl model are @xmath178 and @xmath179 . in the approximation of an infinitely large disk with no hole at the center , @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
    "now we adopt cylindrical coordinates with an origin coincident with the center of the disk face , and a set of rays emanating from the source and incident on the disk , making an angle @xmath182}$ ] with the disk normal at the point of interception .",
    "the incident specific intensity is @xmath183 . in the case of diffusive",
    "reflection from a plane - parallel atmosphere , the standard solution for the specific intensity of the reflected rays ( as a function of energy , @xmath184 ) gives      here , @xmath186 is the cosine of the reflected rays with respect to the disk normal , @xmath187 is the single - scattering albedo ( i.e.  ratio of thomson - scattering cross - section to the total scattering plus absorption cross - section ) , and @xmath188 $ ] are the chandrasekhar @xmath189-functions for isotropic scattering .",
    "the angles are to be evaluated in the frame co - rotating with the disk medium , which is particularly important in the relativistic version of the code when the bulk orbital motion is very rapid close to the black hole .",

    "hrefl returns the reflected continuum , which is further multiplied by an effective reflection fraction , @xmath113 .",
    "the resulting contribution is added to the fraction @xmath222 of direct continuum flux . in other words , @xmath223 corresponds to @xmath208 of the disk covering solid angle as seen by the x - ray source .",
    "thus ,      where @xmath225 has the meaning of observer inclination . the arguments of hrefl are the free parameters of the model ( there are two more that are not listed explicitly here : they are the iron abundance relative to solar , and energy of the fe - k edge ) .",
    "notice that @xmath113 and @xmath222 are _ not independent _",
    ", so no more than one of these two parameters is allowed to be free at any time of the fitting procedure .",
    "this way of coding the model is simply a matter of convenience for the user .",
    "[ fig : example8 ] ( left panel ) compares the pure reflection spectrum produced by hrefl with the pexrav model using an input power law ( photon index @xmath226 ) for two inclination angles ( @xmath227 and @xmath228 , corresponding to @xmath229 and @xmath230 respectively ; pexrav does not allow for values of @xmath231 ) . in hrefl",
    "the parameters @xmath232 and @xmath233 were fixed at @xmath234 and @xmath235 respectively for the spectral fitting described in the present paper .",
    "note that _ the relative iron abundance parameter _ for hrefl was set to @xmath236 because the two codes use different iron abundances .",
    "apart from the adopted approximations , additional discrepancies arise between hrefl and pexrav due to the use of different photoelectric absorption cross - sections ( hrefl uses older versions of cross - section values than pexrav and the difference is visible at low energies of the spectrum ) . between 115  kev the errors are less than 20% (",
    "much better accuracy than this value is achieved for the face - on inclinations ) . if the reflection continuum is combined with the direct continuum , for typical covering factors ( @xmath113 ) , the errors below the fe - k edge are practically negligible .",
    "we conclude with the following concise summary of the approximations used in hrefl .",
    "the starting point of the model is the standard solution of the radiative transfer equation for reflection in a plane - parallel atmosphere .",
    "the simplifying assumptions are as follows .",
    "( i )  isotropic elastic scattering is assumed .",
    "( ii )  approximate analytical forms of the chandrasekhar @xmath189-functions are used , as described in basko ( 1978 ) , but the accuracy of the approximate formulae is better than @xmath210 .",
    "( iii )  when integrating the incident continuum flux on the disk surface , the corresponding @xmath189-function is taken outside the integral and replaced with its mean value , @xmath237 .",
    "[ fig : example8 ] ( right panel ) shows an example of the kyhrefl model spectrum , in which hrefl spectrum was smeared across the disk .",
    "kyhrefl can be interpreted as a compton - reflection model for which the source of primary irradiation is near above the disk , in contrast to the lamp - post scheme with the source on axis .",
    "the approximations for compton reflection used in hrefl ( and therefore also in kyhrefl ) are valid below @xmath174  kev in the source ( and disk ) rest - frame .",
