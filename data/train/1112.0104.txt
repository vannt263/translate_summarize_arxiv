    "random walks in random environments have been at the center of the probabilists interest for several decades .",
    "a specific class of such random walks goes under the banner of the _ random conductance model_. what makes this class special is the fact that the corresponding markov chains are reversible .",
    "this somewhat restrictive feature has the benefit of fruitful connections to other , seemingly unrelated fields : the random resistor networks and gradient fields . at the technical level , many of the problems are thus naturally embedded into the larger area of harmonic analysis and homogenization theory .",
    "this survey article is an expanded version of the set of lecture notes written for a course on the random conductance model that the author delivered at the 2011 cornell summer school on probability .",
    "a personal point of view promoted here is that the random conductance model belongs to the collection of `` paradigm '' problems such as percolation , ising model , exclusion process , etc , that are characterized by a simple definition and yet feature interesting and non - trivial phenomena ( and , of course , pose interesting questions in mathematics ) .",
    "the text below attempts to summarize the important developments in the understanding of the random conductance model . while paying most attention to recent results , much of what is discussed draws on by - now classical work .",
    "the text retains the layout of lecture notes that have been spiced up with comments and references to related subjects .",
    "the general structure is as follows : the first section introduces the three rather different areas where the random conductance model naturally appears .",
    "sections  [ sec2][sec5 ] then deal predominantly with the first such area  namely , the various aspects of the limit behavior of random walks in reversible random environments .",
    "section  [ sec6 ] then applies the introduced machinery to the remaining problems . a number of problems are mentioned throughout the text ; these refer to questions that are either solved directly in the text or remain a subject of research interest until present day .",
    "easier questions are phrased as exercises ; these are of varied difficulty but should all be generally accessible to graduate students .",
    "this text would not exist without the generous invitation from rick durrett to speak at the  2011 cornell summer school on probability .",
    "the author is equally grateful to geoffrey grimmett , who suggested rather persuasively that the preliminary and incomplete notes be made into a proper survey article  rather than stay preliminary and incomplete forever .",
    "much credit goes also to the coauthors n.  berger , o.  boukhardra , c.  hoffman , g.  kozma , o.  louidor , t.  prescott , a.  rozinov , h.  spohn and a.  vandenberg - rodes of various joint projects whose results are reviewed in these notes , and to numerous other colleagues for discussions that helped improve the author s understanding of the subject .",
    "t.  kumagai was very kind to provide valuable comments on the section dealing with heat - kernel estimates , j.  dyre suggested interesting pointers to the physics literature concerning the random resistance problem and m.  salvi offered a lot of feedback and suggestions on the material in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "many thanks go also to an anonymous referee for a quick and efficient report .",
    "the research reported on in these notes has partially been supported by the nsf grants dms-0949250 and dms-1106850 , the nsa grant  nsa - ams 091113 and the gar project p201 - 11 - 1558 .",
    "we begin with the definition of the problem in the context of random walks in random environments .",
    "consider a countable set @xmath0 and suppose that we are given a collection of numbers @xmath1 with the following properties : @xmath2  with @xmath3 and the symmetry condition @xmath4 we will predominantly take  @xmath0 to be the hypercubic lattice @xmath5 naturally embedded in  @xmath6 .",
    "the quantity @xmath7 is called the _ conductance _ of the pair @xmath8  the use of the term will be clarified in the subsection dealing with resistor networks .",
    "when  @xmath0 has an unoriented - graph structure with edge set @xmath9 , we often enforce @xmath10 whenever @xmath11 ; in that case we speak of the _ nearest - neighbor model_. such a model is then called _ uniformly elliptic _",
    "if there is @xmath12 for which @xmath13 when @xmath14 , we use the phrase `` nearest - neighbor model '' for the situation when @xmath9 is the set of pairs of vertices that are at the euclidean distance one from each other .    the aforementioned `` random walk '' in environment  @xmath15 is technically a discrete - time markov chain with state - space  @xmath0 and transition kernel @xmath16 in plain words , the `` walk '' at site  @xmath17 chooses its next position  @xmath18 proportionally to the value of the conductance  @xmath7 .",
    "the non - degeneracy condition guarantees that this chain is well defined everywhere ; when positivity of @xmath19 fails at some vertices  as , e.g. , for the simple random walk on the supercritical percolation cluster , cf fig .",
    "[ fig1 ]  one simply restricts the chain to the subset of  @xmath0 where @xmath20 .",
    "a key consequence of the symmetry condition is :    @xmath19 is a stationary and reversible measure for the markov chain .",
    "proof invoking the above definitions we get @xmath21 which is the condition of reversibility ( a.k.a .",
    "the detailed balance condition ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath19 is stationary follows by summing the extreme ends of this equality on  @xmath17 .",
    "note that for the nearest - neighbor model on  @xmath5 with conductances @xmath22 if @xmath23 and @xmath10 otherwise , the above markov chain reduces to the ordinary simple ( symmetric ) random walk . in this case",
    "the increments of the walk are i.i.d .  which permits derivation of many deep conclusions ",
    "e.g. , donsker s invariance principle , law of iterated logarithm , etc . however , when  @xmath15 is non - constant , the increments of the chain are no longer independent ; worse yet , they are not even stationary .",
    "as we will see , this can be overcome but only at the cost of taking  @xmath15 to be a sample from a shift - invariant distribution .",
    "this reasoning underpins the large area of random walks in random environment of which the above chain is only a rather specific example .",
    "let @xmath24 be the space of all configurations @xmath25 of the conductances .",
    "this space is naturally endowed with a product @xmath26-algebra  @xmath27 .",
    "a _ shift by  @xmath17 _ is the map @xmath28 acting so that @xmath29 we will henceforth assume that  @xmath30 is a probability measure on @xmath31 which is _ translation invariant _ in the sense that @xmath32 we recall that this measure is said to be _ ergodic _ if @xmath33 for any event  @xmath34 with the property @xmath35 for all  @xmath36 .",
    "a canonical example of an ergodic  @xmath30 would be the nearest - neighbor model where the values of conductances are chosen independently at random from the same distribution .",
    "we will use @xmath37 to denote expectation with respect to  @xmath30 .",
    "let us now turn to the main questions one may wish to ask concerning the above setup . for",
    "this let  @xmath38 denote a sample path of the above markov chain and let @xmath39 denote the law of  @xmath40 subject to the initial condition @xmath41 let @xmath42 denote the @xmath43-th power of the transition kernel  @xmath44 , i.e. , @xmath45 the aforementioned connection with the special case of simple symmetric random walk leads to the following questions :    [ p : slln ] does the limit @xmath46 exist almost surely ? under what conditions",
    "is it zero ( as it is for the simple random  walk ) ?    [ p : clt ] under what conditions does the path obey an invariance principle  i.e. , does its law tend to brownian motion under diffusive scaling of space and time ? and if so , what is the rate of convergence ?    does one have a local clt as well in the sense that @xmath47 whenever @xmath18 can be `` comfortably '' reached by the random walk from  @xmath17 in  @xmath43 steps ?",
    "as it turns out , there are subtle but important differences in the precise technical sense in which these asymptotic statements might be true , or at least provably true . indeed , there are two natural laws on the path space that are considered in the literature : the aforementioned _ quenched _ law @xmath48 and the _ annealed _ or , more accurately , _ averaged _",
    "law @xmath49 where  @xmath50 is a specific ( natural ) measure on environments ( similar to  @xmath30 ) .",
    "an advantage of the annealed law is that , thanks to averaging , it allows for an easier control of the irregularities of the environment ; a drawback is that the path law under it is no longer markovian .",
    "as we will see , one of the main challenges for the random conductance model that prevail to the present day is the resolution  of :    does the annealed invariance principle imply the quenched invariance principle ?",
    "( here and henceforth the words annealed and quenched designate the path distribution that is considered for the scaling limit . )",
    "we remark that , for general random walks in random environments , the annealed and quenched law can be dramatically different .",
    "see  fig .",
    "[ fig1b ] .",
    "as soon as the above `` fundamental '' questions have been resolved , one can try to imitate various derivations that have over years been accomplished in the context of the simple random walk .",
    "this leads to further rather interesting questions , for  instance :    what are the intersection exponents  i.e. , the decay exponents for the probability of non - interection up to the first - exit time from a ball of a large radius  of several independent copies of such random walks ?    does the ( chronological ) loop - erasure of the walk have the same scaling limit as the simple random walk ? and how many steps of the walk are needed to generate  @xmath43 steps of the loop - erased walk ?",
    "is there a scaling limit for the trace of the walk in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] as the size of the box tends to infinity ?",
    "the last question naturally puts us into a bounded domain where , as it turns out , many additional technical difficulties arise compared to the full lattice .",
    "however , even the following questions are quite relevant :    [ pb1.8 ] is there a scaling limit of the random walk among random conductances restricted to the half - space , quarter space or a wedge ( i.e. , for the problem with conductances `` leading '' outside these regions set to zero ) ?",
    "although the discrete - time markov chain is very natural , one is often interested in a _ continuous - time _ version thereof .",
    "we will therefore introduce these objects right away and discuss some of the technical issues that come up in this context .",
    "there are two natural ways how to make the time flow continuously .",
    "first , we may simply poissonize the discrete time and consider the transition kernel @xmath51 the corresponding ( continuous - time ) markov process is then referred to as _ constant - speed _ random walk among random conductances ( csrw ) , where the adjective highlights the fact that the jumps happen at the same rate regardless of the current position.=1    another natural way how to make time flow continuously is by attaching a clock to each pair @xmath8 that rings after exponential waiting times with expectation @xmath52 .",
    "this can just as well be done by prescribing the generator @xmath53,\\ ] ] and demanding that the corresponding transition kernel @xmath54 is the ( unique ) stochastic solution of the backward kolmogorov equations , @xmath55 with initial condition @xmath56 here @xmath57 equals one when  @xmath58 and zero otherwise .",
    "this leads to the _ variable speed _",
    "random walk among random conductances ( vsrw ) , because the resulting markov chain at  @xmath17 makes a new jump at rate  @xmath59 .",
    "a specific problem with the vsrw is that the walk may escape to infinity in finite time  a _ blow - up _ occurs .",
    "( this will not happen for the discrete - time walk and thus also the csrw . )",
    "a simple criterion to check is :    [ ex1.11 ] consider a configuration @xmath15 of conductances such that @xmath60 for each  @xmath17 .",
    "let  @xmath61 be the path of the discrete - time random walk among conductances  @xmath15 and let @xmath62 be the times between the successive jumps of the corresponding vsrw . show that @xmath63    the upshot of this exercise is that the question of blow - ups in vsrw can be resolved purely in the context of the discrete - time walk .",
    "we refer to , e.g. , liggett  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  2 ) for a thorough discussion of such situations . see also exercise  [ ex2.8 ] in sect .",
    "[ sec2.2 ] .",
    "the above transition kernels are distinguished by their invariant measures and natural function spaces they act on .",
    "indeed , we can write  @xmath54 as @xmath64 where we think of  @xmath65 as endowed by the counting measure . on the other hand ,",
    "the constant speed markov chain admits the representation @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the space of functions @xmath68 that are square integrable with respect to the measure @xmath19 on  @xmath5 . in this case",
    "the generator of the markov chain is simply @xmath69 .",
    "the reason why one uses different underlying measure on  @xmath5 in the two cases is seen via :    show that @xmath70 is symmetric on @xmath65 while @xmath69 is symmetric on  @xmath67 . in particular",
    ", the vsrw is reversible with respect to the counting measure on  @xmath5 while the csrw is reversible with respect to  @xmath19 .",
    "it is clear that the constant - speed chain will follow the discrete - time chain very closely , but the variable - speed chain may deviate considerably because its time parametrization depends on the entire path .",
    "this discrepancy will be particularly obvious in the places where , in comparison with the neighbors , @xmath59 is either very small ( vsrw gets stuck but csrw departs easily ) or very large ( vsrw departs easily but csrw gets stuck ) .",
    "this may or may not be a disadvantage depending on the context .",
    "the above ( discrete - time ) markov chain is in a class of models for which we can apply a well - known connection between reversible markov processes and harmonic analysis / electrostatic theory .",
    "this connection goes back to the work of kirchhoff in mid 1800s ( kirchhoff  @xcite ) and it underlies many modern treatments of markov processes . for our purposes",
    "the best general introductory text seems to be the monograph by doyle and snell  @xcite .",
    "we begin by introducing some relevant notions for the full lattice ; the finite - volume counterparts will be dealt with later . for",
    "a configuration of the conductances @xmath25 and a function @xmath68 , let us define @xmath71 ^ 2.\\ ] ] in physics vernacular , this is the electrostatic or dirichlet energy corresponding to the electrostatic potential  @xmath72 .",
    "we then define the _ effective ( point - to - point ) resistance _ @xmath73 between  @xmath17 and  @xmath18 by the formula @xmath74 more generally , we define an _ effective point - to - set resistance _ @xmath75 by requiring @xmath76 for all  @xmath77 in the formula above .",
    "of course , both @xmath78 and @xmath73 depend on  @xmath15 , but we leave that notationally implicit .",
    "a key problem now is a computation , an analysis of various scaling properties , of the effective resistance . as a warm - up , consider now the homogeneous problem when the conductances are equal to one for nearest neighbors and zero otherwise .",
    "leaving aside some technical issues , any minimizer of the dirichlet energy in will then  obey @xmath79=0,\\qquad v\\in{\\mathbb z}^d\\setminus\\{x , y\\},\\ ] ] with @xmath80 in other words , @xmath72 is _ discrete harmonic _ everywhere away from  @xmath17 and  @xmath18 .",
    "it is an interesting exercise in upper - division analysis to solve :    fix  @xmath81 . for the homogeneous nearest - neighbor problem ,",
    "use fourier transform to solve the equation @xmath82=i\\bigl[\\delta_x(v)-\\delta_y(v)\\bigr],\\qquad",
    "v\\in{\\mathbb z}^d,\\ ] ] and then adjust  @xmath83 so that @xmath84 . use this to derive an integral formula for  @xmath73 .",
    "we can thus check that while the following problem may appear hard , it is at least not ill posed :    for the homogeneous nearest - neighbor problem on  @xmath85 , show without relying on fourier transform that @xmath86 whenever @xmath17 and @xmath18 are nearest neighbors .",

    "the edges present in the cluster have resistivity one , the edges that are absent are total insulators . a key question is to find the total current density  per unit area of the plates  running through the system . another question is the value of the electrostatic potential at the origin.,width=336 ]    returning to the full - fledged random conductance model ,",
    "let us now discuss the ( somewhat degenerate ) example of the supercritical percolation cluster depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . assuming the potential is fixed to @xmath87 at a conducting plate at `` height '' @xmath88 and to  @xmath89 at the corresponding plate at `` height '' @xmath90",
    ", the question is what is the electrostatic potential right at the center .",
    "as before , this potential is a minimizer of the dirichlet energy @xmath78 in subject to the conditions that @xmath91 when @xmath92 and @xmath93 when @xmath94 . here",
    "@xmath95 is the coordinate unit vector in the @xmath96-th lattice direction .",

    "the key point is that the function @xmath103 defined by is _ harmonic _ with respect to the generator of the continuous time markov chain with the boundary values given as above . here",
    "a function is said to be harmonic at  @xmath17 when @xmath104 .",
    "prove the formula by showing that such a harmonic function is uniquely determined by its boundary data .",
    "notice that , as soon as the conductances are non - constant , there is no reason why the potential  @xmath103 at the symmetry point should be equal to zero  as it would be , thanks to symmetry considerations , for the case of homogeneous networks . obviously , this is quite related to problem  [ pb1.8 ] .",
    "the concept of effective resistance is closely related to the question of _ recurrence _ and _ transience _ of the corresponding markov chain .",
    "let @xmath105 and , for  @xmath106 , @xmath107 set @xmath108^d\\cap{\\mathbb z}^d$ ] .",
    "the chain will then be recurrent if @xmath109 as  @xmath110 and transient otherwise .",
    "the connection with effective resistance shows that the tendency to recurrence decreases with increasing conductances .",
    "explicitly , we have :    show that the function @xmath111 is the unique minimizer of the dirichlet energy for the boundary conditions corresponding to point - to - set resistance @xmath112 and use this to derive @xmath113 conclude that @xmath114 is monotone increasing in each  @xmath7 .",
    "the upshot of this observation is that if @xmath115 for all pairs  @xmath116 , then @xmath117 in particular , if the random walk is recurrent in the environment  @xmath118 then so it is in @xmath15 , and _",
    "vice versa _ for the question of transience . for ( say ) nearest - neighbor random conductance models subject to the ellipticity condition ,",
    "recurrence is thus equivalent to the recurrence of the simple random walk .",
    "however , as soon as ellipticity is violated , interesting problems arise .    consider for illustration the random walk on the supercritical percolation cluster .",
    "there the conductances are bounded above but not below .",
    "this still permits us to conclude that the random walk is is recurrent in spatial dimension @xmath119 , and if it is transient in dimension @xmath120 , then it is transient in all dimensions @xmath121 .",
    "a key question to resolve is thus :    [ pb1.15 ] is the random walk on almost every realization of the three - dimensional supercritical percolation cluster transient ?",
    "the following question should ideally be solved before tackling problem  [ pb1.15 ] :    let @xmath122 and let @xmath123 denote the set of vertices in  @xmath5 that lie in an infinite self - avoiding path using only edges with  @xmath124 .",

    "( in particular , for bernoulli @xmath130 s , it is also a zero - one event . )",
    "there are a good number of variations on the problem depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , but here is one that has been particularly perplexing for a number of years  in spite of an existing solution claimed in the book of jikov , kozlov and oleinik  @xcite .",
    "the formulation goes back to kesten s monograph on percolation ( kesten  @xcite ) .",
    "consider the square box @xmath108 ^ 2\\cap{\\mathbb z}^d$ ] and let @xmath131 be the set of those edges whose both endpoints lie in the infinite bond - percolation cluster and also in  @xmath132 .",

    "it is not hard to convince oneself that @xmath134 is at most of order  @xmath135 , but identifying a precise rate is far more challenging :    [ pb1.18a ] prove that for almost every realization of the supercritical percolation cluster , the limit @xmath136 exists and is independent of the realization .",
    "characterize its value .    of course",
    ", once this has been settled , one may want to go beyond a lln - type of information and study the fluctuations .",
    "interestingly , as observed already a while ago by wehr  @xcite , the variance of  @xmath134 is order at most  @xmath135  at least in the elliptic setting  which suggests the following question :    show that the law of @xmath137 $ ] tends to gaussian as  @xmath110 .",
    "recently , thanks to the work of gloria and otto  @xcite , we even know that the variance is actually of order  @xmath135 ( at least in @xmath121 ) so the time seems ripe for resolving this problem as well .",
    "the third and somewhat unexpected context in which one naturally encounters the random conductance model is that of gradient fields . in our formulation ,",
    "a _ gradient field _ is a collection of @xmath138-valued random variables  @xmath139 indexed by the vertices @xmath36 .",
    "we impose the following law : @xmath140 here  @xmath141 is a finite set and @xmath142 is the set of all edges with at least one endpoint in  @xmath143 .",
    "the function @xmath144 is the _ potential _ which we take to be a continuous , even function with sufficient ( e.g. , quadratic ) growth at infinity .",
    "the measure depends on the values immediately outside  @xmath143 which are set to the _ boundary condition _ @xmath145 by the product of delta - masses .",
    "gradient models are ubiquitous in physical sciences where they arise as effective - interface models , with @xmath139 giving the height of a surface above a reference plane , or in descriptions of the fluctuation fields in critical statistical mechanical ( spin ) models .",
    "a higher - dimensional variant , particularly , @xmath146 , has the interpretation of a deformation field representing the displacements of atoms in a crystal from their ideal positions .",
    "further applications can be found in field theory and material physics .",
    "the reviews by giacomin  @xcite , velenik  @xcite , funaki  @xcite and sheffield  @xcite give more information and further connections .",
    "we will actually consider the measure to be a law on the sigma - field of _ gradient events _",
    "@xmath147 which is legitimate since the corresponding restriction of @xmath148 does not depend on the values of  @xmath145 but only on their differences .",
    "this restriction is dictated by practical reasons  the actual `` height '' of an interface is usually of lesser importance than the `` shape '' of its configuration  but also due to technical restrictions in low spatial dimensions .",
    "we say that a measure @xmath149 on @xmath150 is a _ gradient gibbs measure _",

    "before we start discussing the relevant problems arising in this subject area , it is interesting to note two special instances of the above formalism .",
    "the first one is the @xmath153 case .",

    "an analogue of exercise  [ hw3 ] in @xmath173 will then be :    [ hw4 ] consider the gaussian gradient model with with  @xmath174 . for a sample of the field @xmath175 from the infinite - volume limit @xmath176 , and a smooth @xmath177 with compact support and @xmath178",

    "having dealt with these instructive examples , let us move on to general potentials  @xmath160 .",
    "a remarkable feature of gradient models is that much of what has already been said about the quadratic case applies to any gradient model for which  @xmath160 is _ uniformly strictly convex _",

    "@xmath15  and the generator @xmath238 of the markov chain on environments .",
    "let us make some remarks on how the history of the above ideas seems to have evolved .",
    "first , the idea to decompose additive functionals ( of general stationary ergodic processes ) into a martingale and an error is presumably due to gordin  @xcite who also had the insight to characterize the objects in terms of their functional - analytic ( rather than mixing ) properties .",
    "gordin and lific  @xcite then applied this idea in the specific context of finite - state markov chains .",
    "the understanding that martingale approximations can be the ultimate passage to limit laws for random walks in random environment seems to have grown out of the work of papanicolaou and varadhan  @xcite ; the predecessors of this work were mostly focused on periodic environments .",
    "an alternative approach based on resolvent methods was devised by knnermann  @xcite .",
    "the above ( kipnis - varadhan ) theorem  [ thm - kv ] more or less closed the matter for the annealed law in reversible cases .",
    "two natural ways to generalize theorem  [ thm - kv ] are as follows : one is to go beyond the annealed law and the other is to extend beyond reversible markov chains .",
    "both of these directions are far from settled and both constitute a subject of intense research .",
    "we will expound on how to go from annealed to quenched laws in the rest of these notes .",
    "concerning departures from reversible situations , two lines of thought are generally being followed : one approach , drawing on the functional - analytic ideas , goes by imposing ( and checking ) various _ sector conditions _",
    "( e.g. , olla  @xcite , sethuraman , varadhan and yau  @xcite , horvth , tth and vet  @xcite ) .",
    "the role of these conditions is to control the antisymmetric ( `` non - reversible '' ) part of the generator by the symmetric one .",
    "another approach goes by imposing decay - rate conditions on time - correlations ( e.g. , maxwell and woodroofe  @xcite , derriennic and  lin  @xcite , peligrad and utev  @xcite , klicnarov and voln  @xcite , voln  @xcite , etc . ) .",
    "however , unlike the reversible situations , it does not seem likely that a single condition will eventually cover all cases of interest .",
    "although the subject of martingale approximations is very attractive and useful , in the sequel we will adopt a different approach that emphasizes the geometrical component of the problem over its analytical component . to motivate this approach , consider the explicit example of the simple random walk on the two - dimensional supercritical percolation cluster . when the local drift @xmath394 is non - zero , then this is because there is an odd number of neighbors of the origin and the origin thus no longer lies in the barycenter of its neighbors .",
    "the martingale defect can therefore be thought to arise from the use of the _ geometric _ embedding of the graph , before the edges got removed .",
    "this suggests an idea that one might instead try to look for a different , _ harmonic _ embedding for which @xmath160 would trivially vanish .",
    "a moment s thought shows that such an embedding is easy to find in any finite box using a computer  just freeze the positions on the boundary and then ask the computer to sequentially pass through all vertices and always put them at the center of mass of their ( graph - theoretic ) neighbors .",
    "it turns out that this procedure rapidly converges and leads to a picture as in fig .",

    "this can be studied directly in the case when @xmath790 where , technically speaking , the percolation cluster does not exist but one can still enforce it by conditioning . for the resulting _ incipient infinite cluster _ ( iic ) in sufficiently high dimensions , nachmias and kozma  @xcite proved the alexander - orbach conjecture in all dimensions @xmath791  modulo caveats regarding the existing level of lace - expansion technology .",
    "this conjecture , due to alexander and orbach  @xcite , states that , on iic , @xmath792 notably , this is expected to be false in low spatial dimensions .",

    "see also sect .",
    "a rather convincing argument can be obtained for this by analyzing the formula and making plausible assumptions on the structural properties of the percolation cluster .",
    "resorting to the electrostatic interpretation , the electric current should be carried only by the backbone of the cluster  which , in the limit @xmath793 , becomes a `` net '' of fractal curves .",
    "the exponent in then comes from realizing that in @xmath791 , these fractals have hausdorff dimension  @xmath797 ( although the relation is not so straightforward as a simple equality of these numbers ) .",
    "this intuition seems be confirmed by observations made in the physics literature , see , e.g. , schrder and dyre  @xcite .",

    "we remark that the amount of physics literature written on this and related subject is absolutely overwhelming ; just see the articles citing the review by dyre and schrder  @xcite .",
    "another very interesting class of applications of the above techniques is the random walk in _ dynamical _ ( albeit still reversible ) random environments .",
    "we will not go into details here , but let us just say that much of kipnis - varadhan theory carries to this case and so annealed limit theorems are available .",
    "however , the understanding of _ quenched _ invariance principles is far less evolved .",
    "much can be said when the dynamics of the environment is markovian and there is enough mixing ; one can then get enough control via regeneration arguments . however , even here it is far from clear how to formulate convenient , and very general , conditions under which invariance principles can be obtained .",
    "from the perspective of this text , one specific class of dynamical random environments is of special interest . consider a function @xmath144 which is twice continuously differentiable and define a collection of coupled diffusions @xmath799 via @xmath800 where @xmath801 are independent standard brownian motions .",
    "as it turns out , any gradient gibbs measure for the potential  @xmath160 is stationary under this dynamics . assuming that  @xmath160 is convex , and thus  @xmath802",
    ", we can now define a random walk  @xmath803 which at time  @xmath804 at position  @xmath805 takes a jump to a neighbor  @xmath18 at rate @xmath806 .    an attractive feature of this setting is that it permits us to analyze gradient models with convex interactions . for instance , we have the following formula @xmath807 for the covariance of the ( static ) field in two locations with respect to a gradient gibbs measure  @xmath149 by means of the expected number of visit to  @xmath17 by the above random walk started at  @xmath481  we expect this to be finite only in @xmath121 but other formulas exists in  @xmath167 . obviously , this generalizes the well - known formula from the gaussian case which is distinguished by the fact that the random walk is not coupled to the evolution of the fields .",
    "the formula is one instance of the _ helffer - sjostrand random walk representation _ of correlation functions for the gradient model .",
    "these have been indispensable in the study of gradient models with convex interactions ( e.g. ,  naddaf and spencer  @xcite , giacomin , olla and spohn  @xcite , funaki  @xcite , etc ) .",
    "as discussed at length in the previous section , our current strategy of the proof of the quenched invariance principle seems to generally require the use of rather precise estimates on the probability that the markov chain moves from  @xmath17 to  @xmath18 in  @xmath43 steps .",
    "we emphasize that this is conceptually flawed because we seem to need a _",
    "local - clt _ type of result to finish a plain  clt .",
    "notwithstanding , the study of the heat kernel is interesting in its own right .",
    "we will only review the techniques that are ultimately relevant for the applications at hand and refer to , e.g. , the upcoming textbook by kumagai  @xcite for a more in - depth treatment of that well - developed area .      to set the vocabulary straight ,",
    "let us first remark that by the _ heat kernel _ one usually means the quantity @xmath808 as one can expect , @xmath809 will for large  @xmath43 approach ( a multiple of ) the stationary measure  @xmath19 .",
    "so @xmath810 , being in fact the radon - nikodym derivative of @xmath811 with respect to @xmath19 , is a very natural object to consider .",

    "for us the key fact is that with many markov chains we may associate a natural graph structure  simply put an edge between any two states in the state spaces that have a positive transition probability of a jump from one to the other .",
