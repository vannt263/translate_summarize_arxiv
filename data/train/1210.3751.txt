    "considering the important role of the higgs boson in particle physics , hunting for it has been one of the major tasks of the running large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "recently , both the atlas and cms collaborations have reported some evidence for a light higgs boson near 125 gev @xcite with a di - photon signal rate slightly above the sm prediction @xcite .    as is well known , in new physics beyond the sm model several higgs bosons are predicted , among which the sm - like one may be near 125 gev @xcite .",
    "recently , in our studies @xcite we examined the mass of the sm - like higgs boson in several supersymmetric ( susy ) models including the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm)@xcite , the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm)@xcite and the constrained mssm@xcite . at tree - level",
    ", these susy models are hard to predict a higgs boson near 125 gev , and sizable radiative corrections , which mainly come from the top and top - squark loops , are necessary to enhance the higgs boson mass@xcite . due to the different properties of these susy models , the loop contributions to the higgs boson mass",
    "are different for giving a 125 gev higgs boson .",
    "therefore , different models have different lower bounds on the top - squark mass which is associated with the fine - tuning problem @xcite . on the other hand , since the di - photon higgs signal is the most promising discovery channel for a light higgs boson at the lhc@xcite , in our recent study @xcite we performed a comparative study for the di - photon higgs signal in different susy models , namely the mssm , nmssm and the nearly mininal supersymmertric standard model ( nmssm ) @xcite . in this note",
    "we briefly review these stuides on a 125 gev higgs boson and its di - photon signal rate in different susy models .",
    "this note is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly describe the higgs sector and the di - photon higgs signal in these susy models",
    ". then we present the numerical results and discussions in sec .",
    "iii . finally , the conclusions are given in sec .",
    "different from the sm , the higgs sector in the supersymmetric models is usually extended by adding higgs doublets and/or singlets .",
    "the most economical realization is the mssm , which consists of two higgs doublet @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in order to solve the @xmath2problem and the little hierarchy problem in the mssm , the singlet extension of mssm , such as",
    "the nmssm@xcite and nmssm@xcite has been intensively studied@xcite .",
    "the differences between these models come from their superpotentials and the corresponding soft - breaking terms , which are given by : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the mssm superpotential without the @xmath5 term , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the dimensionless parameters and @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are soft - breaking parameters .",
    "note that in the nmssm and nmssm the @xmath5-term is replaced by the @xmath16 when the singlet higgs field @xmath17 develops a vev @xmath18 .",
    "the differences between the nmssm and nmssm reflect the last term in the superpotential , where the cubic singlet term @xmath19 in the nmssm is replaced by a tadpole term @xmath20 in the nmssm .",
    "this replacement in the superpotential makes the nmssm has no discrete symmetry and thus free of the domain wall problem that the nmssm suffers from .",
    "actually , due to the tadpole term @xmath21 does not induce any interaction , the nmssm is identical to the nmssm with @xmath22 , except for the minimization conditions of the higgs potential and the tree - level higgs mass matrices .    with the superpotentials and the soft - breaking terms giving above",
    ", one can get the higgs potentials of these susy models , and then can derive the higgs mass matrics and eigenstates . at the minimum of the potential , the higgs fields @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath23 are expanded as @xmath24 with @xmath25 174 gev . by unitary rotation",
    "the mass eigenstates can be given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 are physical cp - even higgs bosons ( @xmath28 ) , @xmath29 are cp - odd higgs bosons , @xmath30 is the charged higgs boson , and @xmath31 , @xmath32 are goldstone bosons eaten by @xmath33 and @xmath34 . due to the absence of the singlet field @xmath23",
    ", the mssm only has two cp - even higgs bosons and one cp - odd higgs bosons , as well as one pair of charged higgs bosons .    at the tree - level",
    ", the higgs masses in the mssm are conventionally parameterized in terms of the mass of the cp - odd higgs boson ( @xmath35 ) and @xmath36 and the loop corrections typically come from top and stop loops due to their large yukawa coupling . for small splitting between the stop masses , an approximate formula of the lightest higgs boson mass is given by@xcite , @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the formula manifests that larger @xmath40 or @xmath41 is necessary to push up the higgs boson mass . and",
    "the higgs boson mass can reach a maximum when @xmath42 for given @xmath40 ( i.e. the so - called @xmath43 scenario ) .",
    "note that the lightest higgs boson is the sm - like higgs boson @xmath44 ( with the largest coupling to vector bosons ) in most of the mssm parameter space .",
    "different from the case in the mssm , the higgs sector in the nmssm depends on the following six parameters , @xmath45 and in the nmssm the input parameters in the higgs sector are @xmath46 because the coupling @xmath47 in the superpotential , the tree - level higgs boson mass has an additional contribution in the nmssm and nmssm , @xmath48 in order to push up the tree - level higgs boson mass , @xmath6 has to be as large as possible and @xmath41 has to be small .",
    "the requirement of the absence of a landau singularity below the gut scale implies that @xmath49 0.7 at the weak scale , and the upper bound on @xmath6 at the weak scale depends strongly on @xmath41 and grows with increasing @xmath41@xcite .",
    "however , this can still lead to a larger tree - level higgs boson mass than in the mssm .",
    "therefore , the radiative corrections to @xmath50 may be reduced in the nmssm and nmssm , which may induce light top - squark and ameliorate the fine - tuning problem@xcite .    in the nmssm and nmssm , due to the mixing between the doublet higgs fields and the singlet higgs field ,",
    "the sm - like higgs boson @xmath44 may either be the lightest cp - even higgs boson or the next - to - lightest cp - even higgs boson , which corresponds to the so - called pull - down case or the push - up case@xcite , respectively .",
    "although the mass of the sm - like higgs boson in the nmssm is quite similar to that in the nmssm , the higgs signal is quite different .",
    "this is because the peculiarity of the neutralino sector in the nmssm , where the lightest neutralino @xmath51 as the lightest supersymmetric particle(lsp ) acts as the dark matter candidate , and its mass takes the form@xcite @xmath52 this expression implies that @xmath53 must be lighter than about @xmath54 gev for @xmath55 ( perturbativity bound ) and @xmath56 ( from lower bound on chargnio mass ) . and",
    "@xmath51 must annihilate by exchanging a resonant light cp - odd higgs boson to get the correct relic density .",
    "for such a light neutralino , the sm - like higgs boson around 125gev tends to decay predominantly into light neutralinos or other light higgs bosons@xcite .      considering the di - photon signal is of prime importance to searching for higgs boson near 125 gev , it is necessary to estimate its signal rate , and we define the normalized production rate as @xmath57 /[\\gamma(h_{sm}\\to gg ) br(h_{sm}\\to \\gamma\\gamma ) ] \\nonumber \\\\ & = &   [ \\gamma(h\\to gg ) \\gamma(h\\to \\gamma\\gamma ) ] /[\\gamma(h_{sm}\\to gg ) \\gamma(h_{sm}\\to \\gamma\\gamma ) ] \\times \\gamma_{tot}(h_{sm})/\\gamma_{tot}(h ) \\nonumber\\\\ & = & c_{hgg}^2 c_{h\\gamma\\gamma}^2\\times \\gamma_{tot}(h_{sm})/\\gamma_{tot}(h ) \\label{definition}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the couplings of higgs to gluons and photons in susy with respect to their sm values , respectively . in susy ,",
    "the @xmath60 coupling arises mainly from the loops mediated by the third generation quarks and squarks , while the @xmath61 coupling has additional contributions from loops mediated by w - boson , charged higgs boson , charginos and the third generation leptons and sleptons .",
    "their decay widths are given by@xcite @xmath62 with @xmath63 , and @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the mass of sfermion and chargino , respectively .",
    "in the limit @xmath67 , the asymptotic behaviors of @xmath68 are given by @xmath69 one can easily learn that the w - boson contribution to @xmath61 is by far dominant , however , for light stau or squarks with large mixing , the @xmath61 coupling can be enhanced . while light squarks with large mixing can suppress the @xmath60 coupling .",
    "therefore , light stau with large mixing may enhance the di - photon signal rate@xcite , while light squarks with large mixing have little effect on the di - photon signal rate .",
    "in our work the higgs boson mass are calculated by the package nmssmtools@xcite , which include the dominant one - loop and leading logarithmic two - loop corrections .",
    "considering the higgs hints at the lhc , we focus on the higgs boson mass between 123 gev and 127 gev , furthermore , we consider the following constraints :    * the constraints from lhc experiment for the non - standard higgs boson . * the constraints from lep and tevatron on the masses of the higgs boson and sparticles , as well as on the neutralino pair productions .",
    "* the indirect constraints from b - physics ( such as the latest experimental result of @xmath70 ) and from the electroweak precision observables such as @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , or their combinations @xmath74 @xcite .",

    "the signal rate is relevant with the coupling @xmath59 and @xmath58 and the total width of the sm - like higgs boson .",
    "both the coupling @xmath59 and @xmath58 are affected by the contributions from the squark loops , especially the light top - squark loop , so in the fig.[fig3 ] we give the relationship between the lighter top - squark mass and the coupling @xmath59 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "the figure shows that the light @xmath87 may suppress the coupling @xmath58 significantly , especially in the nmssm . while the light top - squark has little effect on the coupling @xmath59 because there are additional contributions , as the eq.([hgg])and eq.([hgaga ] ) shown . as analyzed in the sec.ii , light stau may enhance the coupling @xmath59 , so in fig.[fig4 ] we give the correlation between @xmath100 and the coupling @xmath59 in the mssm .",

    "fig.4 also manifests that the enhancement of the coupling @xmath59 corresponds to large @xmath106 , which leads to large mixing .",
    "these results exactly verifies the discussions in the sec.ii .",
    "since @xmath107 is the main decay mode of the light higgs boson , the total width of the sm - like higgs boson may be affected by the effective @xmath108 coupling @xmath109 , as discussed in @xcite . under the effect of the combination @xmath110",

    "therefore , we can conclude that the reason for the enhancement in the signal rate is very different between the mssm and nmssm . in the mssm",

    "we show the dependence of the signal rate @xmath102 on @xmath111 .",
    "obviously , for the signal rate larger than 1 , @xmath111 is usually very small , which leads to large suppression on the reduced coupling @xmath108 .",
    "the figure also shows that the push - up case is more effective to enhance the signal rate than the pull - down case .",
    "this is because the push - up case is easier to realize the large mixing between the singlet field and the doublet field@xcite .    as the case in the nmssm , nmssm can also accommodate a 125 gev sm - like higgs@xcite .",
    "however , due to the peculiar property of the lightest neutralino @xmath114 in the nmssm@xcite , the decay mode of the sm - like higgs is very different from the case in the mssm and nmssm . as discussed in the sec.ii , @xmath115 may be dominant over @xmath107 in a major part of parameter space in the nmssm @xcite , which induce a severe suppression on the di - photon higgs signal .",
    "although the higgs mass can be easily reach to 125 gev , the di - photon signal is not consistent with the lhc experiment .",
    "therefore , the nmssm may be excluded by lhc experiment .    , and",
    "the times ( green ) denotes those further satisfying the @xmath116 constraint .",
    "in the right frame , the crosses ( red ) are same as those in the left frame , while the times ( sky - blue ) denote the samples further satisfying the @xmath117 constraint.(taken for ref.@xcite),width=453 ]        we also considered the sm - like higgs boson mass and its di - photon signal in the constrained mssm ( including cmssm and nuhm2 ) under various experimental constraints , especially the limits from @xmath70 . because @xmath118 , so it may provide a rather strong constraint on susy with large @xmath41 . considering the large theoretical uncertainties for the calculation of @xmath119 , we use not only the lhcb data , but also the double ratio of the purely leptonic decays defined as @xmath120 with @xmath121 .",
    "the surviving parameter space is plotted in fig.[fig7 ] for the cmssm and fig.[fig8 ] for the nuhm2 .",
    "it shows that both the cmssm and nuhm2 are hard to realize a 125 gev sm - like higgs boson , and also the di - photon higgs signal is suppressed relative to the sm prediction due to the enhanced @xmath122 coupling .",
    "therefore , the constrained mssm may also be excluded by the lhc experiment .",
    "in this work we briefly review our recent studies on a 125 gev higgs and its di - photon signal rate in the mssm , nmssm , nmssm and the constrained mssm . under the current experimental constraints",
    ", we find : ( i ) the sm - like higgs can easily reach to 125 gev in the mssm , nmssm and nmssm , while it is hard to satisfy in the constrained mssm ; ( ii ) the nmssm may predict a lighter top - squark than the mssm , even as light as 100 gev , which can ameliorate the fine - tuning problem ; ( iii ) the di - photon higgs signal is suppressed in the nmssm and the constrained mssm , but in a tiny corner of the parameter space in the mssm and nmssm , it can be enhanced .",

    "<S> in this note we briefly review our recent studies on a 125 gev higgs and its di - photon signal rate in different low energy supersymmetric models , namely the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) , the nearly minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) and the constrained mssm . </S>",
    "<S> our conclusion is : ( i ) in the allowed parameter space the sm - like higgs boson can easily be 125 gev in the mssm , nmssm and nmssm , while it is hard to realize in the constrained mssm ; ( ii ) the di - photon higgs signal rate in the nmssm and constrained mssm is suppressed relative to the prediction of the sm , while the signal rate can be enhanced in the mssm and nmssm ; ( iii ) the nmssm may allow for a lighter top - squark than the mssm , which can thus ameliorate the fine - tuning problem . </S>"
