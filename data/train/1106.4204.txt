    "<S> a multichannel thin - film sensor is implemented from a set of microstrip - coupled split - ring resonators ( srr s ) with different dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> each srr exhibits a unique high - q resonance that is sensitive to the presence of a sample in a particular area . </S>",
    "<S> hence , this srr - based sensor can function ( i ) to detect different samples simultaneously to increase the throughput or ( ii ) to characterise nominally identical samples at multiple frequencies to increase the sensor selectivity . </S>",
    "<S> the design principle is validated with simulation and measurement . </S>",
    "<S> owing to the optimized design , sensing a low - permittivity film with a thickness as small as one thousandth of the operating wavelength is achievable .    </S>",
    "<S> withawat withayachumnankul@xmath0 , kata jaruwongrungsee@xmath1 , + christophe fumeaux@xmath2 , and derek abbott@xmath2    @xmath3school of electrical & electronic engineering , the university of adelaide , adelaide , sa 5005 , australia    @xmath4school of electronic engineering , faculty of engineering , king mongkut s institute of technology ladkrabang , bangkok 10520 , thailand    @xmath5nanoelectronics and mems laboratory , national electronics and computer technology center , pathumthani 12120 , thailand    split - ring resonators ( srrs ) are among many fundamental building blocks for metamaterials that can collectively provide customizable values of the permittivity and/or permeability . </S>",
    "<S> a srr is typically made of one or two concentric subwavelength metallic rings ( namely single or double srr , respectively ) with a narrow split in each ring @xcite . in response to an electromagnetic excitation , </S>",
    "<S> it exhibits a strong magnetic resonance whose frequency is determined by its dimensions , geometry , and constituent materials . on resonance </S>",
    "<S> , the ring develops an intense and localised electric field at the narrow split . the sensitivity of the resonance frequency to constituent materials , together with the field localisation , subwavelength ring size , and high - q resonance , makes srrs ideal for thin - film sensing .    owing to these properties , srr s </S>",
    "<S> have recently been implemented for biosensors in different configurations . </S>",
    "<S> planar arrays of srr s were employed for thin - film sensing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , those sensors require a relatively large amount of the sample to uniformly cover an array with tens to hundreds of srrs during the measurement . the constraints of the sample size and uniformity can be eliminated by using either microstrip - coupled srr s @xcite or waveguide - loaded srrs @xcite . although both microstrip and waveguide arrangements can be used for thin - film sensing , electromagnetic coupling is much stronger in the former case , resulting in its higher immunity against noise and fluctuations .    for the microstrip - coupling configuration , an srr is positioned in a close proximity to a microstrip transmission line , which builds up a magnetic field around itself in a quasi - tem wave propagation . </S>",
    "<S> this oscillating magnetic field induces circulating current in the srr loop . in the quasistatic limit </S>",
    "<S> , an srr can be approximated by an inductor and a capacitor in the form of a series _ lc _ resonant circuit . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the ring forms the inductor , and the split forms the capacitor . </S>",
    "<S> the resonance takes place in the srr when the electric energy stored in the capacitor is balanced with the magnetic energy stored in the inductor . </S>",
    "<S> loading a sample onto the srr surface alters the total capacitance of the structure and hence results in a detectable change in the resonance frequency .    </S>",
    "<S> this article presents a multichannel thin - film sensor based on microstrip - coupled srr s . </S>",
    "<S> several srr s with different sizes are placed along a microstrip line . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the sensor exhibits multiple resonances , each of which represents a single channel governed by an individual srr . </S>",
    "<S> each resonance is sensitive to the presence of a sample deposited at the narrow split of the corresponding srr . </S>",
    "<S> since every resonator possesses a high - q resonance at a unique frequency , mutual interaction among the resonators is minimal . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , several srrs can be placed densely without compromising the performance .        beyond the multichannel sensing capability </S>",
    "<S> , this article proposes additionally a strategy to improve significantly the sensitivity of srr sensors by creating a strong and localized field enhancement in a single spot . in earlier designs , several double srr s @xcite or a single srr with two splits </S>",
    "<S> @xcite have been used . in such structures , </S>",
    "<S> several distributed capacitors collectively determine the resonance frequency , and a considerable amount of sample is required to change all of these capacitors . if the sample partially covers the structure , the unaffected capacitance reduces the sensitivity in the sensing region as the capacitive change is then not as pronounced . in the present design , </S>",
    "<S> each resonance is caused by a single srr with only one split , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ba_sensor](a ) , and consequently , only one distributed capacitor is present . </S>",
    "<S> a change in this capacitor by sample loading in the small split region has a direct and large impact on the resonance frequency .    </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ba_sensor](a ) also depicts some other important features of the implemented resonators . </S>",
    "<S> each srr has a rectangular shape to maximize coupling to the microstrip transmission line . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a stronger resonance that is robust to measurement uncertainties . at each srr split </S>",
    "<S> , sharp tips are adopted to concentrate the electric field to a small spot @xcite . in terms of a series _ lc _ circuit , the tapered shape of the tips decreases the capacitance at the split , and hence increases the resonance q - factor .    </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ba_sensor](b ) shows the proposed sensor fabricated by using standard photolithography and chemical etching . </S>",
    "<S> this particular four - channel sensor is realized from four different srrs positioned along a 50-@xmath6 microstrip line . </S>",
    "<S> all of the resonators share the same dimensions excepting the width , @xmath7 , that equals 8 , 6 , 4.5 , and 3  mm for r1 , r2 , r3 , and r4 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this causes a difference in the loop inductance and hence in the resonance frequency among the srrs . </S>",
    "<S> the other dimensions common to all of the srrs are as follows : @xmath8  mm , @xmath9  mm , @xmath10  mm , @xmath11  mm , @xmath12  mm , @xmath13  mm , and @xmath14  mm . </S>",
    "<S> the metal for the srrs , microstrip , and ground plane is copper with a thickness of 35  @xmath15 m , coated with gold to prevent oxidization . </S>",
    "<S> the substrate is an rt / duroid 6010.2lm high - frequency laminate ( ceramic - ptfe composite ) with a thickness of 1.90  mm , a relative permittivity of 10.2 , and a loss tangent of 0.0023 . </S>",
    "<S> this sensor specification yields four high - q resonances in the microwave s band .        during the experiment </S>",
    "<S> , the sensor is connected to a vector network analyzer , agilent technologies n5230a , and the transmission parameter @xmath16 is registered at room temperature in the range between 1.53.5  ghz with a resolution of 3  mhz . the numerical simulation is carried out with a commercial full - wave electromagnetic solver , cst microwave studio , based on the finite - integration technique ( fit ) . </S>",
    "<S> the gap size @xmath17 in each ring resonator is slightly adjusted in the simulation to reflect the fabrication imperfections , as observed under a microscope .    </S>",
    "<S> the measured and simulated transmission profiles of the sensor without any sample are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ba_s21ref ] with small discrepancies caused by fabrication tolerances and limits in simulation accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> the results show four non - overlapping resonances corresponding to the four distinct srrs . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest resonance @xmath18 is associated with r1 , which has the largest inductance , the second lowest resonance @xmath19 with r2 , and so on . </S>",
    "<S> no change in the resonances is observed during 5 hours of measurement , demonstrating the thermal stability of the sensor .        </S>",
    "<S> further insight can be obtained from the simulation , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ba_field ] , where the electric - field distribution on the sensor surface is calculated for every channel . at each resonance frequency </S>",
    "<S> , only the relevant srr establishes a strong and highly confined electric field around the capacitive split , and no field enhancement is observed elsewhere . </S>",
    "<S> the field enhancement in any active ring is as high as 380  kv / m , given the input power of only 1  w. these calculated field distributions confirm the extreme field confinement achieved with the implemented srrs , which is a basis for high - performance sensing .        in the next experiment </S>",
    "<S> , ethanol is used as a sample under test by the multichannel sensor . at 3  ghz </S>",
    "<S> , ethanol has a relative permittivity and loss tangent of 6.0 and 0.96 , respectively @xcite . in each measurement , 5 @xmath15l of ethanol is dropped by using a high - precision pipette onto the split of a selected srr channel , and the sensors response is observed . </S>",
    "<S> the transmission results are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ba_s21mult ] . the observed resonance shifting and damping indicate the presence of the sample in the selected channel . by comparing the resonance frequencies of the loaded sensor in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ba_s21mult ] with the reference values in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ba_s21ref ] , it is clear that non - active srr channels show no detectable change in the resonance frequency . </S>",
    "<S> hence , it is clear that the four sensing channels can operate independently .    </S>",
    "<S> each srr can be approximated by a series _ lc _ circuit with a resonance frequency @xmath20 , where @xmath21 denotes the ring inductance and @xmath22 denotes the split capacitance . </S>",
    "<S> the sensitivity of the resonance frequency to the split capacitance can be expressed as @xcite @xmath23 it can be deduced from this equation that if the relative change in the capacitance formed by the split , @xmath24 , is constant , the relative change in the resonance frequency , @xmath25 , is fixed , regardless of the ring inductance . nonetheless , the relative change in the resonance frequency for the active channel varies between -4.6% and -6.1% among the four channels , despite a fixed volume of sample . </S>",
    "<S> this small variation is presumably caused by manual sample deposition , which results in a slight difference in the sample location . </S>",
    "<S> this uncertainty can be readily overcome with an automated process .    </S>",
    "<S> the sample volume used in the experiment is considerably small . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , additional simulations suggest that only one nanolitre of ethanol , i.e. , a 0.1-mm cube , is unambiguously detectable with a frequency shift of 15  mhz . in other words </S>",
    "<S> , the ratio between the operating wavelength and the film thickness can be as large as three orders of magnitude . in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , this article presents a thin - film sensor with a series of optimized srr s as sensing elements . </S>",
    "<S> the fabricated sensor successfully performs multichannel detection with an enhanced sensitivity . scaling down the structure to operate at higher frequencies further reduces the minimum amount of detectable sample . </S>",
    "<S> more channels can be added to the sensor provided that resulting resonances are sparse enough to avoid mutual coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the resonance of each channel can be positioned at an abritary frequency where unique dielectric features of the sample are expected . </S>",
    "<S> the realization can be used for on - site disposable sensors , which allow sensing with either high selectivity or high throughput . </S>"
