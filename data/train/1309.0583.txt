    "the measurement of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by nasa wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( ) @xcite and esa planck surveyor @xcite has enabled us to probe cosmology in high precision .",
    "the cmb signal is observed through the convolution of an antenna beam , an effect , and possible systematic error , which must be carefully treated in the data analysis .",
    "the main beam of the are shown not azimuthally symmetric about the line of sight , but rather elliptical ( see table 1 ) due to the fact that they can not be all put on the center of the focal plane , but it was assumed that the inflight effective beam convolving the signal should be averaged to become symmetric and circular after each pixel on the map having more than at least 400 hits during the 1-year observation @xcite .",
    "prior to data release , the issue of beam asymmetry in full - sky cmb experiment is already discussed in @xcite .",
    "the issue of asymmetry of the beam is later tackled in @xcite with a new map - making procedure , which resultantly deconvolves the beam sidelobes to produce maps with the true sky signal convolved by symmetrized beams . whilst the issue of beam asymmetry",
    "is considered on the estimation of the cmb angular power spectrum @xcite and is demonstrated to have less effect @xcite , it poses a serious issue on statistical isotropy , the foremost example being the quadruople and octupole alignment @xcite or anomaly in the result such as low quadrupolar power @xcite .",
    "it is because systematic alignment in orientation of even a mildly - asymmetric beam can result in large - scale anisotropy .    to investigate this issue",
    ", we would like to see what _ effective _ beam pattern is convolving the signal .",
    "note that for each pixel the asymmetric inflight beam with different azimuthal orientation ( around the line - of - sight direction ) convolves the underlying signal thousands of times with some pointing uncertainty , so we are particularly interested in the asymmetry and azimuthal orientation of the _ effective _ elliptical main beam which is from the collective effect of the inflight beam .",
    "theoretically , one can gather all the inflight beam information through the time - ordered data and formulate the effective beam pattern for each point on the sky , but nevertheless it is difficult to get the effective beam pattern in the final product such as the internal linear combination ( ilc ) map due to the complex noise properties . throughout this paper",
    "we define @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the major and minor axis of an elliptical shape , respectively , and the asymmetry of the beam as @xmath3 .    in this paper",
    "we develop a method that can reveal the asymmetry and azimuthal orientation of the effective main beam in different small patches of the sky , based on the flat sky approximation .",
    "there are two ways the effective beam convolving the signal manifests itself in the signal .",
    "one is through the shape of the bright extragalactic point sources , the other is in the fourier amplitude , the latter of which is particularly useful for the processed map such as the ilc map .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows . in sec.2",
    "we introduce the fourier method and in sec.3 we test the accuracy and consistency of the method .",
    "we then employ the methods on data in sec.4 , and the conclusion and discussion is in sec.5 .",
    "in cmb experiment , the temperature measured in the sky can be written as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the cmb and foreground signal , respectively , @xmath7 is the effective beam convolving the signal , @xmath8 is the noise , and the star sign @xmath9 denotes convolution .",
    "the convolving beam was often assumed azimuthally symmetric and thus @xmath10 ( i.e no @xmath11 dependence ) . and",
    "in terms of spherical harmonic coefficients , @xmath12 where the @xmath13 is the spherical harmonics and @xmath14 is the spherical harmonic coefficients of the signal from the sky . due to the scan strategy",
    ", the inflight effective beam has different asymmetry and orientation to different line of sight .",
    "if we are to examine the anisotropies caused by the inflight beam asymmetry , one has to resort to its effect in small patches , where the beam geometry can be described in the flat - sky approximation . within this approximation ,",
    "the signal measured is now @xmath15\\exp({2\\pi i { \\bf k}\\cdot { \\bf r}})= \\sqrt{c({\\bf k } ) } \\exp[i \\psi({\\bf k } ) ]   \\label{gen}\\ ] ] to estimate the inflight effective beam , we assume the main beam is of an elliptical gaussian shape , which can be expressed in cartesian coordinate @xmath16,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the orientation against the @xmath18-axis .    we have tested the beam asymmetry and listed in table 1 .",
    "the beam maps are from observation of jupiter and we list the a and b side for k , ka , q1 , v1 and w1 differencing assembly . the high asymmetry is due to the feeds being away from the primary focus . it is significantly lessened from multiple observations with different orientation in each pixel .    .beam",
    "asymmetry @xmath19 .",
    "the beam maps are from jupiter observation and we list the a and b side of the focal planes for k , ka , q1 , v1 and w1 band .",
    "the asymmetry is high because the feeds are away from the primary focus . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to estimate the effective beam , we introduce two methods , both utilizing the information in fourier domain . in this paper",
    "we assume that the effective beam is slowly rotating across the sky , thus for a small patch of sky the effective beam convolving the signal shall have a fixed orientation .",
    "in @xcite it is demonstrated that the beam profile manifests itself in the 2d fourier space . in figure [ demo ]",
    "we show 3 different orientations of the beam convolving on simulated cmb signal in a @xmath20 patch and in the bottom row the corresponding fourier amplitude of the beam - convolved patch .",
    "one of the important characteristics shown in the fourier space is that the beam orientation turns @xmath21 due to the reciprocity between the real and fourier space .",
    "it is thus possible to extract the inflight effective beam information contained in the patches .",
    "below we present some methods that can reveal the inflight effective beam convolving the patch of the sky .      for patches with bright radio point sources , we can",
    ", following the assumption of slow rotation of the beam , further assume that the point source is the representative of the effective beam for the whole patch .",
    "bright point sources are manifestation of the beam similar to the standard measurement of jupiter for the beam profile , but that in point sources , we can get to at best @xmath22 db for most cases . nevertheless , it is still useful for providing the asymmetry and orientation of the inflight effective beam .",
    "we show in fig.[pointsource ] the bright point source gb6 j2253@xmath231608 in q1 da as an example .",
    "the estimated asymmetry @xmath24 and the angle is @xmath25 for the major axis against the ( positive ) ecliptic equator .      as shown in fig.[demo ]",
    "the effective beam manifests itself in the fourier domain , so we can extract the beam asymmetry and orientation directly from the fourier amplitude .",
    "assuming the foreground power spectrum @xmath26 @xcite , we take the grid points @xmath27 in the fourier domain where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the size of the nominal beam of the frequency band .",
    "even for the same @xmath31 , the number of grid points varies for different frequency bands due to different beam size . also note that the level of @xmath31 can not be lower than the pixel noise , thus simulation",
    "is required in order to get the optimal @xmath31 .",
    "the other method is the phase perturbation method , developed in @xcite . for the measured signal @xmath32 in eq.([gen ] ) , we can add the controlled white noise @xmath33 : @xmath34 to perturb the phases of the patch and calculate the phase shift @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the fourier phase at mode @xmath38 for patch @xmath39 and @xmath32 respectively .",
    "note that the controlled noise level can not be lower than that of the pixel noise ( the @xmath8 in eq.([gen ] ) ) .",
    "we can then calculate the mean from an ensemble of , say @xmath40 , such perturbation : @xmath41 for the fourier modes where the fourier amplitudes of the convolved signal are much higher than that of the controlled noise , the phases are not perturbed much , so the @xmath42 .",
    "when the controlled noise level is close to that of the signal , the phases are perturbed so much that can be approximated @xmath43 where the controlled noise level is set as the same as that of the pixel noise @xcite .",
    "to demonstrate the fourier method for estimation of the effective beam , an elliptical beam whose fwhm of major and minor axis is 33 and 30 arcmin , respectively ( thus asymmetry @xmath44 ) , is used to convolve a @xmath45 cmb map simulated with the best - fit @xmath46cdm model before adding noise at level @xmath47 mk .",
    "the orientation of the major axis is @xmath48 against the @xmath18-axis .",
    "we also make the patch with non - periodic boundary to mimic the real situation .",
    "we then take the grid points @xmath49db for amplitude method and those with @xmath50 for phase perturbation method , and fit them with free - parametered elliptical shape . as shown in fig.[simu",
    "] , once again the reciprocal property causes the orientation of the beam turned @xmath21 in the fourier space , now @xmath51 .",
    "note that in our simulation we use a gaussian elliptical function to mimic the effective beam , and omit the collective effect from the far sidelobe of the beam .",
    "we then employ the method described above and the estimated asymmetry and orientation from the amplitude information is @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and @xmath54 and @xmath55 from phase perturbation method , which is to be compared with the input @xmath56 and orientation angle @xmath51 .",
    "one can see that the error from the angle is @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively , whereas the error of the asymmetry is 0.019 and @xmath59 .",
    "one source of error in such estimation comes from small number of points on equal - spaced grid in fourier domain .",
    "the less the points available in fourier space , the higher error in estimation . the number of points available from the fourier grid is limited by the beam size and the noise level . for estimating small beam size such as w band , there are more points in the fourier grids ( due to reciprocity ) , but the noise level is higher than the low - frequency bands . for larger beam in k band , there are less points .",
    "thus to gain more available grid points we resort to large patches such that the white noise level can be lowered .",
    "we conduct simulations on q band with the nominal beam size fwhm 30.6 arcmin for 3 different ratios @xmath60 , 1.15 and 1.20 , , the ratio of the axes , instead of asymmetry @xmath19 because the error ratio shall be defined in terms of the @xmath31 , not @xmath19 . ] each with 18 different orientations .",
    "we apply the two fourier methods to test their accuracy and consistency . in fig.[validity ] we plot the error in asymmetry against the error in orientation angle for the fourier amplitude method ( left panel ) and phase perturbation method ( middle ) on the simulations .",
    "the fourier amplitude method skews the estimate in orientation angle for @xmath60 ( plus sign ) , but has better accuracy and consistency for @xmath61 ( triangle sign ) and 1.20 ( diamond sign ) .",
    "phase perturbation method has more accuracy but less consistency . since each use different information from the fourier space ( though not independently ) , we take the mean from both estimates and plot on the right panel . the estimated error in angle is @xmath62 deg and error in axis ratio @xmath63 , indicating our estimate on the orientation angle is reasonably good , while the asymmetry is underestimated by 5.6% .",
    "we can also use the fourier method mentioned above for the patch containing the bright point source gb6 j2253@xmath231608 ( fig.[pointsource ] ) .",
    "the asymmetry from fourier method is @xmath64 and angle is @xmath65 .",
    "the difference in the estimated asymmetry @xmath66 is as predicted : our fourier method consistently underestimate the asymmetry , whereas the difference in the estimated angle @xmath67 is negligible .",
    "we can now employ the methods we demonstrate in the previous section to estimate the inflight effective beam on the data .",
    "we divide the whole map into @xmath68 patches and apply the fourier method described above on the patches .",
    "the reason why we estimate the beam on such a large patch is that the noise level in the data is quite high , which inevitably set the limit of the available fourier grid points .",
    "we show our estimate of the inflight effective beam of the 9-year q1 da .    due to the scan strategy that the observes from a lissajous orbit about the l2 sun - earth lagrange point , and telescope line of sight is around @xmath69 off the spinning axis , the path swept out on the sky by a given line of sight resembles a spirograph pattern that reaches from the north to south ecliptic poles ,",
    "hence the inflight beam pattern is closely related to the ecliptic coordinate . in fig.[q1 ] we plot the estimated inflight effective beam pattern .",
    "the length of the bars indicates the asymmetry in @xmath19 and the inclination denotes that of the major axis .",
    "the bottom 2 panels show the histogram of the asymmetry @xmath19 and the orientation angle .",
    "the angle is defined with the that between the bar and the ecliptic equator .",
    "we plot the same for the ilc map in fig.[ilc ] .",
    "our results confirm that the inflight effective beams convolving the underlying signal are asymmetric for most parts of the sky , and are not randomly oriented .",
    "the alignment is most severe around ecliptic equator . near the ecliptic poles , however , the asymmetry is small due to the averaging effect from different orientations from the scan strategy .",
    "the histogram of the orientation angle shows high concentration around @xmath21 . on the other hand ,",
    "the ilc map results from the combination of different frequency band maps , which have different beam orientations and beam sizes , hence the asymmetry the orientation alignment of the effective beam on the ilc map is ameliorated by the internal combination .",
    "in this paper we have developed a method to reveal the asymmetry and orientation of the inflight effective beam in the data .",
    "we divide the whole sky map into patches and exploit the information resided in the fourier domain .",
    "we test the accuracy and consistency of our fourier method with simulations and also with the bright point source in the patch , the shape of the latter being a representative of the inflight effective beam .",
    "we then apply the method on the q1 da and ilc map , and it is confirmed that the effective beam is rather asymmetric with strong alignment in their orientation around the ecliptic equator in the q1 da map . that the asymmetry of the effective beam in the ilc map is lessened does not guarantee the ilc map is not without the systematic error from the beam effect",
    ". with highly - aligned beam with significant asymmetry combing through the measured signal , which includes strong emission of the galactic foreground , can have elongated effect on the signal , which shall cause some systematic error in the foreground cleaning process for the cmb if it is not carefully treated .",
    "the method developed in this paper can be used on the planck data ."
