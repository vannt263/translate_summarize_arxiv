    "the atmospheric and solar neutrino oscillations observed in the super - kamiokande experiment @xcite have provided robust evidence that neutrinos are massive and lepton flavors are mixed .",
    "all analyses of the atmospheric neutrino deficit favor @xmath1 as the dominant oscillation mode with the mass - squared difference @xmath2 and the mixing factor @xmath3 at the @xmath4 confidence level .",
    "in addition , the present super - kamiokande and sno @xcite data indicate that the solar neutrino anomaly is most likely attributed to the matter - enhanced @xmath5 oscillation via the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) mechanism @xcite with @xmath6 and @xmath7 at the @xmath8 confidence level ( large - angle msw solution ) .",
    "the strong hierarchy between @xmath9 and @xmath10 , together with the small @xmath11-component in @xmath12 configuration restricted by the chooz reactor neutrino oscillation experiment @xcite , implies that atmospheric and solar neutrino oscillations decouple approximately from each other .",
    "each of them is dominated by a single mass scale , which can be set as @xmath13 or @xmath14 .",
    "the mixing factors of solar , atmospheric and chooz neutrino oscillations are simply given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the @xmath17 lepton flavor mixing matrix linking the neutrino mass eigenstates @xmath18 to the neutrino flavor eigenstates @xmath19 .",
    "as current experimental data favor @xmath20 , two large flavor mixing angles can be drawn from eq .",
    "( 1 ) in a specific parametrization of @xmath16 : one between the 2nd and 3rd lepton families and the other between the 1st and 2nd lepton families .",
    "so far a number of phenomenological ans@xmath0tze of lepton flavor mixing with two large rotation angles , including the `` democratic '' ansatz @xcite and the `` bimaximal '' ansatz @xcite , have been proposed and discussed @xcite . in this paper",
    "we pay our particular attention to a new ansatz of the form ( up to a trivial sign or phase rearrangement ) @xmath21 proposed recently by harrison , perkins and scott @xcite .",
    "this so - called `` tri - bimaximal '' flavor mixing pattern predicts @xmath22 and @xmath23 , consistent very well with the atmospheric neutrino oscillation data and the large - angle msw solution to the solar neutrino problem .",
    "however , it leads also to @xmath24 , implying the absence of both high - energy matter resonances and intrinsic cp violation in neutrino oscillations .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to discuss two simple but instructive possibilities to modify the tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing pattern in eq .",
    "( 2 ) , such that cp violation can naturally be incorporated into the resultant scenarios of _ nearly _ tri - bimaximal flavor mixing .",
    "two specific textures of the charged lepton mass matrix are taken into account , in order to obtain small but non - vanishing @xmath25 or @xmath26 .",
    "we find that two new ans@xmath0tze have practically indistinguishable consequences on the atmospheric neutrino oscillation , but their predictions for @xmath27 , @xmath26 and leptonic cp violation are rather different .",
    "we also discuss an interesting approach to construct lepton mass matrices under permutation symmetry , from which one may derive another _ nearly _ tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing scenario with @xmath28 but with no intrinsic cp violation in neutrino oscillations .",
    "the fact that masses of three active neutrinos are extremely small is presumably attributed to the majorana nature of neutrino fields @xcite . in this picture",
    ", the light ( left - handed ) neutrino mass matrix @xmath29 must be symmetric and can be diagonalized by a single unitary transformation : @xmath30 the charged lepton mass matrix @xmath31 is in general non - hermitian , hence the diagonalization of @xmath31 needs a bi - unitary transformation : @xmath32 the lepton flavor mixing matrix @xmath16 , defined to link the neutrino mass eigenstates @xmath18 to the neutrino flavor eigenstates @xmath19 , measures the mismatch between the diagonalization of @xmath31 and that of @xmath29 : @xmath33 .",
    "note that @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( 3 ) and @xmath35 in eq . ( 4 ) are physical ( real and positive ) masses of light neutrinos and charged leptons , respectively .    in the flavor basis",
    "where @xmath31 is diagonal ( i.e. , @xmath36 being a unity matrix ) , the flavor mixing matrix is simplified to @xmath37 .",
    "the tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing pattern @xmath38 can then be constructed from the product of two euler rotation matrices : @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and so on .",
    "taking @xmath42 and @xmath43 , we obtain @xmath44 the vanishing of the ( 1,3 ) element in @xmath45 assures an exact decoupling between solar ( @xmath46 ) and atmospheric ( @xmath1 ) neutrino oscillations .",
    "the corresponding neutrino mass matrix @xmath29 takes the form @xmath47 where @xmath48 if @xmath49 holds , one may arrive at a simpler texture of @xmath29 with @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "let us comment briefly on the mathematical structure of @xmath29 obtained in eq .",
    "indeed @xmath29 can be decomposed as @xmath53 where @xmath54 such a structure of the neutrino mass matrix is very similar to that giving rise to the bimaximal flavor mixing @xcite .",
    "note that the diagonalization of @xmath29 requires an orthogonal matrix which is able to diagonalize @xmath55 and @xmath56 simultaneously .",
    "this orthogonal matrix is just @xmath45 given in eq .",
    "although the decomposition of @xmath29 shown above is by no means unique , it might have a meaningful interpretation in an underlying theory of neutrino masses with specific flavor symmetries .",
    "the tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing pattern will be modified , if @xmath57 deviates somehow from the unity matrix .",
    "this can certainly happen , provided that the charged lepton mass matrix @xmath31 is not diagonal in the flavor basis where the neutrino mass matrix @xmath29 takes the form given in eq .",
    "as @xmath58 describes a product of two special euler rotations in the real ( 2,3 ) and ( 1,2 ) planes , the simplest form of @xmath57 which allows @xmath59 to cover the whole @xmath17 space should be @xmath60 or @xmath61 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion ) . to make cp violation incorporated into @xmath16",
    ", we adopt the complex rotation matrices : @xmath62 in this case , we arrive at lepton flavor mixing of the pattern @xmath63 or of the pattern @xmath64 it is obvious that @xmath65 and @xmath66 represent two nearly tri - bimaximal flavor mixing scenarios , if the rotation angles @xmath67 and @xmath68 are small in magnitude .",
    "the complex phase @xmath69 in @xmath65 or @xmath70 in @xmath66 is the source of leptonic cp violation in neutrino oscillations .",
    "as the mixing angle @xmath67 or @xmath68 arises from the diagonalization of @xmath31 , it is expected to be a simple function of the ratios of charged lepton masses .",
    "then the strong mass hierarchy of charged leptons naturally assures the smallness of @xmath67 or @xmath68 , as one can see later on .",
    "indeed a proper texture of @xmath31 which may lead to the flavor mixing pattern @xmath65 is @xmath71 where @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "the mixing angle @xmath67 in @xmath65 is then given by @xmath75 on the other hand , a proper texture of @xmath31 which may give rise to the mixing pattern @xmath66 reads as follows : @xmath76 where @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 .",
    "the mixing angle @xmath68 in @xmath66 turns out to be @xmath80 in view of the hierarchy of three charged lepton masses ( i.e. , @xmath81 ) , we obtain @xmath82 and @xmath83 to a good degree of accuracy . numerically",
    ", we find @xmath84 and @xmath85 by using the inputs @xmath86 mev , @xmath87 mev , and @xmath88 gev @xcite .",

    "mixing patterns are practically indistinguishable in the atmospheric neutrino oscillation experiment .",
    "it is possible to distinguish between them in the solar neutrino oscillation experiment .",
    "they can unambiguously be distinguished with the measurements of @xmath25 and cp or t violation in a variety of long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "the strength of cp or t violation in neutrino oscillations , no matter whether neutrinos are dirac or majorana particles , is measured by a universal and rephasing - invariant parameter @xmath100 @xcite , defined through the following equation : @xmath101 in which the greek subscripts run over @xmath102 , and the latin subscripts run over @xmath103 .",
    "considering two lepton mixing scenarios proposed above , we obtain @xmath104 for illustration , we typically take @xmath105",
    ". then we arrive at @xmath106 and @xmath107 , respectively .",
    "the former could be determined from the cp - violating asymmetry between @xmath108 and @xmath109 transitions or from the t - violating asymmetry between @xmath108 and @xmath46 transitions in a long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiment , if the terrestrial matter effects are insignificant or under control .",
    "we have discussed two simple possibilities to construct the charged lepton and neutrino mass matrices , from which two nearly tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing patterns can naturally emerge .",
    "both scenarios are compatible with the large - angle msw solution to the solar neutrino problem , although their numerical predictions for the mixing factor @xmath27 may be different from each other .",
    "two lepton mixing patterns are practically indistinguishable in the atmospheric neutrino oscillation experiment , but their consequences on @xmath25 and leptonic cp violation are different and distinguishable",
    ". only one of them is likely to yield an observable cp- or t - violating asymmetry in long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "there are certainly other possibilities to modify the tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing ansatz , such that non - vanishing @xmath25 ( and cp violation ) can naturally be incorporated into the resultant scenarios of nearly tri - bimaximal mixing . for illustration",
    ", we follow an interesting approach proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to consider charged lepton and neutrino mass matrices of the form @xmath110 clearly @xmath111 is invariant under cyclic permutation of three generation indices @xcite , and @xmath112 has four texture zeros @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath113 was assumed to be real in ref .",
    "one will see later on that @xmath28 may non - trivially result from the phase of @xmath113 .",
    "the hermitian matrices @xmath111 and @xmath112 can be diagonalized as follows : @xmath114 it is straightfoward to obtain @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117 ; and @xmath118 where @xmath119 . then the lepton flavor mixing matrix @xmath120 , which describes the mismatch between the diagonalization of @xmath111 and that of @xmath112 , takes the form @xmath121 the tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing ( up to a trivial sign or phase rearrangement @xcite ) can then be reproduced from @xmath16 in the limit @xmath122 . the nearly tri - bimaximal mixing scenario obtained in eq .",

    "note that @xmath134 holds exactly , although @xmath16 is complex",
    ". therefore no intrinsic cp violation could be observed in neutrino oscillation experiments , if the tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing pattern or its revised version in eq .",
    "( 28 ) were correct .",
    "the result @xmath135 makes such a nearly tri - bimaximal ansatz less interesting .",
    "of course , the complex phases in @xmath16 may have significant effects on the neutrinoless double beta decay , if neutrinos are majorana particles .",
    "finally let us remark that both the tri - bimaximal mixing pattern and its possible extensions require some peculiar flavor symmetries to be imposed on the charged lepton and neutrino mass matrices .",
    "it is likely that one of the three nearly tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing patterns under discussion serves as the leading - order approximation of a more complicated flavor mixing matrix . for the time being , however , such simple ans@xmath0tze are very instructive and useful to explore the main features of lepton flavor mixing and cp violation through neutrino oscillations .",
    "we expect that more delicate neutrino oscillation experiments in the near future can help pin down the explicit pattern of neutrino mixing , from which one may get some insight into the underlying flavor symmetry and its breaking mechanism responsible for the origin of both lepton masses and leptonic cp violation .",
