    "the reasons for this preference are well - known ( see @xcite , and references therein ) . in the present paper , we propose a randomized extension of hotelling s test that we call raptt ( random projections t - test ) which involves randomly projecting @xmath1-dimensional samples into a space of lower dimension @xmath43 , where @xmath44 .",
