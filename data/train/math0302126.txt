    "the set of ( straight - line , or geometric ) non - crossing graphs with a given set of vertices in the plane is of interest in computational geometry , geometric combinatorics , and related areas . in particular",
    ", much effort has been directed towards enumeration , counting and optimization on the set of maximal such graphs , that is to say , triangulations .",
    "the poset structure of the set of non - crossing graphs , however , is only well understood if the points are in convex position . in this case",
    "the non - crossing graphs containing all the hull edges are the same as the polygonal subdivisions of the convex @xmath1-gon and , as is well - known , they form the face poset of the _ @xmath7-associahedron_. in this paper we construct from @xmath0 a polytope whose face poset contains the poset of non - crossing graphs on @xmath0 embedded in a very nice way . in the following statement , and in the rest of the paper , we distinguish between vertices of @xmath6 ( _ extremal _ points ) and other points in the boundary of @xmath6 , which we call _ semi - interior _ points .",
    "let @xmath0 be a finite set of @xmath1 points in the plane , not all contained in a line .",
    "let @xmath5 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 be the number of interior , semi - interior and extremal points of @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "there is a simple polytope @xmath10 of dimension @xmath11 , and a face @xmath12 of @xmath10 ( of dimension @xmath13 ) such that the complement of the star of @xmath12 in the face - poset of @xmath10 equals the poset of non - crossing graphs on @xmath0 that use all the convex hull edges .",
    "[ thm : posetintro ]    this statement deserves some words of explanation :    * our equality of posets reverses inclusions . maximal non - crossing graphs ( triangulations of @xmath0 ) correspond to minimal faces ( vertices of @xmath10 ) .",
    "* we remind the reader that the _ star _ of a face @xmath12 in a polytope is the subposet of facets that contain @xmath12 and all their faces . in the complement of the star of @xmath12",
    "we must consider the polytope @xmath10 itself as an element , which corresponds to the graph with no interior edges . * if @xmath0 is in convex position , then @xmath10 is the associahedron .",
    "the face @xmath12 is the whole polytope , whose star we must interpret as being empty .",
    "* our results are valid for point sets in non - general position .",
    "our definition of non - crossing in this case is that if @xmath14 is between @xmath15 and @xmath16 , then the edge @xmath17 can not appear in a non - crossing graph , regardless of whether @xmath14 is incident to an edge in the graph .",
    "this definition has the slight drawback that a graph which is non - crossing in a point set @xmath0 may become crossing in @xmath18 , but it makes maximal crossing - free graphs coincide with the triangulations of @xmath0 ( with the convention , standard in computational geometry , that triangulations of @xmath0 are required to use all the points of @xmath0 as vertices ) . to be consistent with this , a convex hull edge is an edge between two consecutive extremal or semi - interior points of @xmath0 in the boundary of @xmath6 . * since convex hull edges are irrelevant to crossingness ,",
    "the poset of _ all _ non - crossing graphs on @xmath0 is the direct product of the poset in the statement and a boolean poset of rank @xmath19 .",
    "we give a fully explicit facet description of @xmath10 .",
    "it lives in @xmath20 and is defined by the 3 linear equalities ( [ eq : s ] ) and the @xmath21 linear inequalities ( [ eq : vf ] ) and ( [ eq : tf ] ) of section [ section : polyhedron ] , with some of them turned into equalities .",
    "( with one exception : for technical reasons , if @xmath0 contains three collinear boundary points we need to add extra points to its exterior and obtain @xmath10 as a face of the polytope @xmath22 of the extended point set @xmath23 ) .",
    "the @xmath24 s in equations ( [ eq : vf ] ) and ( [ eq : tf ] ) and in the notation @xmath10 denote a vector in @xmath25 .",
    "our construction starts with a linear cone @xmath26 ( definition [ defi : cone ] ) whose facets are then translated using the entries of @xmath27 to produce a polyhedron @xmath28 , of which the polytope @xmath10 is the unique maximal bounded face .",
    "our proof goes by analyzing the necessary and sufficient conditions for @xmath27 to produce a polytope with the desired properties and then proving the existence of valid choices of @xmath27 .",
    "in particular , theorem [ thm : exist_valid_f ] shows one valid choice .",
    "this is essentially the same approach used in @xcite for the polytope of pointed non - crossing graphs constructed there , which is actually the face @xmath12 of @xmath10 referred too in the statement .",
    "our results generalize the construction in @xcite in two directions : on the one hand they refer to all non - crossing graphs ( not only pointed ones ) and on the other hand we show how to deal with non - general position .    mapping the instances of a combinatorial object to the vertices of a certain polytope",
    "is useful for optimization and enumeration purposes . in the case of triangulations ,",
    "two such polytopes have been used in the past ; the `` secondary polytope '' @xcite and the `` universal polytope '' @xcite of the point set .",
    "our construction adds to these two , but it has one advantage : we have an explicit facet description of the polytope . in the secondary polytope , facets correspond to the coarse polygonal subdivisions of @xmath0 , which have no easy characterization . in the universal polytope , the facet description in @xcite gives only a linear programming relaxation of the polytope , which makes integer programming be needed in order to optimize linear functionals on it .",
    "that the poset we are interested in is not the whole poset of faces of the polytope @xmath10 may seem a serious drawback for using it as a tool for enumeration of all the triangulations of a planar point set .",
    "but the subposet we are interested in is not just a subposet .",
    "being the complement of the star of a face @xmath12 has theoretical and practical implications . on the one hand , it implies that the poset is a shellable ball of dimension @xmath29 , since there is a shelling order ending in the facets that contain @xmath12 . on the other hand ,",
    "the part of the boundary of @xmath10 that we are interested in becomes the ( strict ) lower envelope of a convex polyhedron via any projective transformation that sends a supporting hyperplane of @xmath12 to the infinity .      actually , the set of _ all _ the vertices of the polytope @xmath10 is interesting on its own merits :    [ thm : polytopeintro ] the vertex set of the polytope @xmath10 of theorem [ thm : posetintro ] is in bijection to the set of all pseudo - triangulations of @xmath0 .",
    "the 1-skeleton of @xmath10 is the graph of flips between them .",
    "+    a pseudo - triangle is a perhaps non - convex polygon with three corners ( non - reflex vertices ) .",
    "a pseudo - triangulation of @xmath0 is a subdivision of @xmath6 into pseudo - triangles using @xmath0 as vertex set . as an example , figure [ fig : graph_sq ] shows the pseudo - triangulations of a set of four extremal points and one interior point , with the graph of flips between them embedded as ( a schlgel diagram of ) a 4-dimensional polytope . the face @xmath12 of theorem [ thm : posetintro ] is actually the facet on which the schlgel diagram has been performed .",
    "why the interior point is `` unmarked '' in the three triangulations of the point set and `` marked '' in the other 8 pseudo - triangulations will be explained in section [ section : pseudot ] .",
    "pseudo - triangulations , first introduced by pocchiola and vegter around 1995 ( see @xcite ) , have by now been used in many computational geometry applications , among them visibility @xcite , ray shooting @xcite , and kinetic data structures @xcite .",
    "streinu @xcite introduced the _",
    "minimum _ or _ pointed pseudo - triangulations _ ( p.p.t.s , for short ) , proved certain surprising relations of them to structural rigidity of non - crossing graphs , and used them to prove the carpenter s rule theorem ( the first proof of which was given shortly before by connelly et al @xcite ) .",
    "p.p.t.s can also be described as the maximal non - crossing and pointed graphs .",
    "see all the relevant definitions in section [ section : pseudot ] .",
    "the paper @xcite , using these rigid theoretic properties of p.p.t.s , constructed a polytope @xmath30 whose vertex set is precisely the set of p.p.t.s of a given point set .",
    "our construction is heavily based on it ( but this paper is mostly self - contained ) .",
    "our method not only extends that construction to cover all pseudo - triangulations , it also shows that the method can easily be adapted to point sets in non - general position , with a suitable definition of pseudo - triangulation for such point sets ( definition [ defi : pseudot - sp ] ) .",
    "the flips between pseudo - triangulations that appear in our theorem [ thm : polytopeintro ] are introduced in section [ section : pseudot ] ( see definition [ defi : ptflips ] ) for point sets in general position and in section [ section : special ] ( see definition [ defi : ptflip - sp ] and figures [ fig:5pts ] and [ fig:6pts ] ) for point sets with collinearities . the definition is new ( to the best of our knowledge ) but in the case of general position it has independently been considered in @xcite , where flips between pseudo - triangulations are related to geometric flips between polyhedral terrains .",
    "it is proved there that the graph of flips of a point set @xmath0 ( that is , the 1-skeleton of our polytope ) has diameter bounded by @xmath31 .",
    "the same bound for the graph of pointed pseudo - triangulations ( the 1-skeleton of the face @xmath12 ) has been obtained in @xcite .",
    "our flips restrict to the ones in @xcite and @xcite when the two pseudo - triangulations involved are pointed , and they are also related to the flips of pocchiola and vegter @xcite as follows : pocchiola and vegter were interested in pseudo - triangulations of a set @xmath32 of convex bodies , and they defined a graph of flips between them . that graph is regular of degree @xmath33 .",
    "pocchiola ( personal communication ) has shown that taking each @xmath34 to be a sufficiently small convex body around each point , our graph is obtained from the one in @xcite by contraction of certain edges .",
    "it is sometimes convenient to study pseudo - triangulations or non - crossing graphs on @xmath0 that contain a specified subset of edges .",
    "for example , the pseudo - triangulations of a non - convex polygon @xmath35 , are in bijection with pseudo - triangulations of the point set @xmath36 which use all the boundary edges of @xmath35 and any ( arbitrarily chosen ) triangulation of @xmath37 .",
    "we can even allow for additional interior points of @xmath35 to be used as vertices ( a situation called an `` augmented polygon '' in @xcite ) .",
    "we want to emphasize that our results apply to these and other cases : since each facet of @xmath10 corresponds to the presence of a certain edge , pseudo - triangulations or non - crossing graphs that contain a specific non - crossing graph @xmath38 correspond to faces or vertices of @xmath10 contained in the face that corresponds to @xmath38 .",
    "[ coro : polygon ] let @xmath38 be a non - crossing graph on @xmath0 with @xmath39 non - boundary edges ( edges not in the boundary of @xmath6 ) .",
    "then , the set of pseudo - triangulations of @xmath0 that contain @xmath38 as a subgraph is the vertex set of a simple polytope of dimension @xmath40 , whose 1-skeleton is the graph of flips between them .    in particular , the pseudo - triangulations of a non - convex polygon @xmath35 with @xmath1 vertices are the vertex set of a polytope of dimension @xmath41 .",
    "figure [ fig : graph_hex ] shows the ( 3-dimensional ) polytope of pseudo - triangulations of a certain non - convex hexagon .     +      our construction has also rigid - theoretic consequences .",
    "a generically rigid graph ( for dimension 2 ) is a graph which becomes rigid in almost all its straight - line embeddings in the plane .",
    "generically rigid graphs need at least @xmath42 edges , because that is the number of degrees of freedom of @xmath1 points in the plane ( after neglecting rigid motions )",
    ". generically rigid graphs with exactly @xmath42 edges are called _",
    "isostatic _ and they admit the following characterization , due to laman ( see , for example , @xcite ) : they are the graphs with @xmath42 edges and with the property that any subset of @xmath43 vertices is incident to at least @xmath44 edges . using this characterization , ileana streinu @xcite proved that every pointed pseudo - triangulations is an isostatic graph .",
    "we have the following generalization :    [ thm : rigidintro ] let @xmath45 be a pseudo - triangulation of a planar point set @xmath0 in general position .",
    "let @xmath38 be its underlying graph .",
    "then :    1 .",
    "@xmath38 is infinitesimally rigid , hence rigid and generically rigid .",
    "2 .   there are at least @xmath46 edges of @xmath45 incident to any subset of @xmath39 pointed plus @xmath47 non - pointed vertices of @xmath45 ( assuming @xmath48 ) .    in the statement , `` general position ''",
    "can actually be weakened to  no three boundary points of @xmath0 are collinear . in the presence of boundary collinearities , non - rigid pseudo - triangulations ( for our definition ) exist .",
    "for example , only six of the fourteen pseudo - triangulations of the point set of figure [ fig:6pts ] are rigid .    if we recall that a pseudo - triangulation with @xmath39 non - pointed vertices has exactly @xmath49 edges ( see proposition [ prop : pseudot ] ) , theorem [ thm : rigidintro ] has the consequence that the space of self - stresses on a pseudo - triangulation has exactly dimension @xmath39 .",
    "this fact follows also from the results of @xcite .",
    "* can every planar and generically rigid graph be embedded as a pseudo - triangulation ? that the answer is positive should be considered a conjecture of the set of authors of @xcite , a paper that actually solves the minimal case : planar laman graphs can be embedded as pointed pseudo - triangulations .",

    "but the intermediate cases remain open .",
    "* are non - crossing graphs on @xmath0 the face poset of a polyhedron ?",
    "a naive answer would be that such a polyhedron is obtained by just deleting from the facet definition of @xmath10 those facets containing @xmath12 .",
    "but this does not work even in the point set with a single point in general position in the interior of a quadrilateral ( the one in figure [ fig : graph_sq ] ) .",
    "using the equations that define the polytope it can be checked that the removal of the facet @xmath12 in this example gives a polyhedron with two extra vertices , not present in @xmath50 .",

    "it turns out that the pseudo - triangulations with the minimum possible number of edges are also very interesting from different points of view .",

    "part 1 implies that , among pseudo - triangulations of @xmath0 , pointed ones have the minimum possible number of edges .",
    "for this reason they are sometimes called _ minimum pseudo - triangulations_. part 2 says that pointed pseudo - triangulations coincide with maximal non - crossing and pointed graphs .",

    "part 3 is equivalent to saying that a pseudo - quadrangle ( even a degenerate one ) can be divided into two pseudo - triangles in exactly two ways .",

    "this means that after the removal the vertex has two reflex angles , that is to say two angles of exactly 180 degrees each .",
    "we insert the edge joining this vertex to the opposite corner of the pseudo - triangle containing the original reflex angle .",
    "if a mark is removed , then the only possibility is : ( 4 ) the pointed vertex holding the mark is incident to a unique reflex angle ( remember that we consider interior angles of 180 degrees as reflex ) .",
    "we insert the edge joining the vertex to the opposite corner of the corresponding pseudo - triangle .",

    "an example of a mirror flip can be seen towards the upper right corner of figure [ fig:5pts ] .",
    "the reader will have noticed that the graphs of figures [ fig:5pts ] and [ fig:6pts ] are more than regular of degrees 4 and 3 respectively .",
    "they are the graphs of certain simple polytopes of dimensions 4 and 3 .",
    "( figure [ fig:5pts ] is a prism over a simplex ) .        for each @xmath219 let @xmath28 be the polyhedron defined in section 3 .",
    "recall that everything we said in that section , up to corollary [ coro : polyhedron ] , is valid for points in special position .",
    "our main result here is that theorems [ thm : exist_valid_f ] and [ thm : polyhedron ] hold word by word in the case with no boundary collinearities , except that a precision needs to be made regarding the concept of validity .",
    "recall that for a given choice of @xmath128 , an edge @xmath112 or a point @xmath113 are called _ tight _ for a certain @xmath220 or for a face @xmath12 of @xmath28 if the corresponding equation ( [ eq : vf ] ) or ( [ eq : tf ] ) is satisfied with equality .",
    "[ defi : valid - sp ] we call _ strict supporting graph _ of a @xmath220 ( or face @xmath12 of @xmath28 ) the marked graph of all its tight edges and points , and denote it @xmath115 .",

    "hence , we could do what follows only in terms of strict validity and would obtain the same polyhedron . but weak validity is needed , as we will see in remark [ rem : continuity ] , if we want our construction to depend continuously on the coordinates of the point set @xmath0 .    to obtain the equations that valid choices must satisfy we",
    "proceed as in section [ section : valid ] .",
    "the crucial point there was that a marked graph is non - crossing if and only if it does not contain the negative parts of the unique stress in certain subgraphs .",
    "[ lemma : excluded ] let @xmath0 be a point set with no three collinear boundary points . then",
    ", a marked graph on @xmath0 is non - crossing if and only if it does not contain any of the following four marked subgraphs : the negative parts of the marked graphs displayed in figure [ fig : circuits ] and the negative parts of the marked graphs displayed in figure [ fig : circuits - sp ] .",
    "exclusion of the negative parts of the left graphs in both figures are our definition of crossingness for an unmarked graph .",
    "an interior vertex is pointed if and only if none of the negative parts of the right graphs appear .        for the right part , observe that , by definition , stresses on a marked graph form a linear space .",

    "we know three different stresses of the complete graph on these five points : the one we used in section [ section : valid ] for the four exterior points and the two that we have just introduced for the two collinear triplets . from these three we can eliminate the coordinates of edges @xmath213 and @xmath224 and we get a stress with the stated signs .    [ thm : all_valids - sp ] let @xmath0 be a point set with no three collinear boundary points .",
    "then , a choice of @xmath27 is weakly valid if it satisfies equations ( [ eq : sum_wf ] ) for all quadruples of points in general position plus the following sets of equations :    * for any three points @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath212 collinear in this order : @xmath225 * for any five points as in the right part of figure [ fig : circuits - sp ] , the following equation where the @xmath160 s and the @xmath181 s form a stress with signs as indicated in the figure ( by convention , @xmath160 equals zero for the two missing edges in the graph ) : @xmath226      equations ( [ eq : sum_wf ] ) guarantee that no weak or strict tight graph contains the two excluded marked graphs of negative edges and points of figure [ fig : circuits ] .",
    "equations ( [ eq : sum_wf3 ] ) and ( [ eq : sum_wf5 ] ) with strict inequality , do the same for the graphs of figure [ fig : circuits - sp ] . that these equations are equivalent to strict validity is proved exactly as in section [ section : valid ] .",
    "the reason why we allow equality in equations ( [ eq : sum_wf3 ] ) if we only want a weakly valid choice is that the negative part of the stress consists of a single edge . if the equation is satisfied with equality then the hyperplane corresponding to this edge is a supporting hyperplane of the face of @xmath136 given by the intersection of the three hyperplanes of the positive part of the stress .",
    "[ coro : exist_valid_f - sp ] let @xmath0 be a point set with no collinear boundary points .",
    "any choice of @xmath27 satisfying equations ( [ eq : sum_wf ] ) for every four points in general position plus the following ones for every collinear triplet is weakly valid : @xmath227      for the first assertion , we need to show that equations ( [ eq : sum_wf5 ] ) follow from equations ( [ eq : sum_wf ] ) and ( [ eq : weak ] ) . but",
    "this is straightforward : from our proof of lemma [ lemma : sign_circuits - sp ] it follows that equation ( [ eq : sum_wf5 ] ) is just the one obtained substituting in ( [ eq : sum_wf ] ) the values for @xmath228 and @xmath229 obtained from the two equations ( [ eq : weak ] ) .    for the last assertion , we already proved in corollary [ coro : exist_valid_f ] that the choices of @xmath27 introduced there satisfy equations ( [ eq : sum_wf ] ) .",
    "it is easy , and left to the reader , to show that they also satisfy ( [ eq : weak ] ) .    *",
    "( main theorem , case without boundary collinearities ) * [ thm : polyhedron - sp ] let @xmath0 be a point set with no three collinear points in the boundary of @xmath6 , and let @xmath27 be a weakly valid choice of parameters .",
    "then , @xmath136 is a simple polyhedron of dimension @xmath33 with all the properties stated in theorems [ thm : polyhedron ] and [ thm : polytope ] .    recall that if no three boundary points are collinear then every fully - marked pseudo - triangulation ( i.e. , maximal marked non - crossing graph ) has @xmath33 edges plus marks , exactly as in the general position case ( lemma [ lemma : markedpseudot - sp ] ) . in particular , it is still true , for the same reasons as in the general position case , that @xmath28 is simple and all its vertices correspond to f.m.p.t.s , for any valid choice of @xmath27 .",
    "the rest of the arguments in the proof of theorem [ thm : polyhedron ] rely on the graph of flips being connected , a property that we still have . as for theorem [ thm : polytope ] , the face @xmath10 is bounded because lemma [ lemma : t(v , t ) ] still applies .",
    "the rest is straightforward .",
    "[ rem : continuity ] it is interesting to observe that taking the explicit valid choice of @xmath27 of theorem [ thm : exist_valid_f ] the equations defining @xmath28 depend continuously on the coordinates of the points in @xmath0 . when three points become collinear , the hyperplane corresponding to the ( now ) forbidden edge becomes , as we said in the proof of theorem [ thm : all_valids - sp ] a supporting hyperplane of a codimension 3 face of @xmath28 .",
    "the combinatorics of the polytope changes but maintaining its simplicity .",
    "this continuity of the defining hyperplanes would clearly be impossible if we required our choice to be strictly valid for point sets with collinearities .",
    "let @xmath230 and @xmath231 be the two point sets with five points each whose pseudo - triangulations are depicted in figures [ fig : deg1 ] and [ fig : deg2 ] .",
    "the first one has three collinear points and the second is obtained by perturbation of the collinearity .",
    "these two examples were computed with the software cdd+ of komei fukuda @xcite before we had a clear idea of what the right definition of pseudo - triangulation for points in special position should be . to emphasize the meaning of weak validity , in figure [ fig : deg1 ] we are showing the weak supporting graphs of the vertices of @xmath232 , rather than the strict ones .",
    "the 10 first pseudo - triangulations are common to both figures ( upper two rows ) .",
    "only the pseudo - triangulations of @xmath230 using the two collinear edges plus the mark at the central point of the collinearity are affected by the perturbation of the point set .",
    "this is no surprise , since these two edges plus this mark are the positive part of the stress involved in the collinearity . at each of these six pseudo - triangulations ,",
    "the hyperplane of the big edge is tangent to the vertex of @xmath232 corresponding to the pseudo - triangulation .",
    "when the collinearity is perturbed , this hyperplane moves in one of the two possible ways : away from the polyhedron , in which case the combinatorics is not changed , or towards the interior of the polyhedron , in which case the old vertex disappears and some new vertices are cut by this hyperplane . in our case , these two behaviors appear each in three of the six `` non - strict '' pseudo - triangulations of @xmath230 . when the hyperplane moves towards the interior , four new vertices appear where there was one",
    ".      in the presence of boundary collinearities , lemma [ lemma : markedpseudot - sp ] implies a significant difference : with the equations we have used so far , the face of @xmath26 defined by tightness at boundary edges and vertices is not the origin , but an unbounded cone of dimension @xmath8 .",
    "indeed , for each semi - interior point @xmath113 , the vector @xmath104 with @xmath65 an exterior normal to the boundary of @xmath6 at @xmath113 and every other coordinate equal to zero defines an extremal ray of that face . as a consequence ,",
    "the corresponding face in @xmath28 is unbounded .",
    "we believe that it should be possible to obtain a polyhedron with the properties we want by just intersecting the polyhedron of our general definition with @xmath8 hyperplanes . but instead of doing this we use the following simple trick to reduce this case to the previous one . from a point set @xmath0 with boundary collinearities",
    "we construct another point set @xmath23 adding to @xmath0 one point in the exterior of each edge of @xmath6 that contains semi - interior points .",
    "[ lemma : reduction ] a marked graph @xmath38 on @xmath0 is non - crossing if and only if it becomes a non - crossing graph on @xmath23 when we add to it the marks on all points of @xmath233 and the edges connecting each of these points to all the points of @xmath0 lying in the corresponding edge of @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , we can construct the polyhedron @xmath234 for this extended point set @xmath23 ( taking any @xmath27 valid on @xmath23 ) , and call @xmath28 the face of @xmath234 corresponding to the edges and marks mentioned in the statement of lemma [ lemma : reduction ] . then :      let @xmath10 be the face of @xmath28 corresponding to the @xmath235 edges between consecutive boundary points and the @xmath9 marks at vertices of @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath12 be the face of @xmath10 corresponding to the remaining @xmath236 marks .",
    "then , @xmath10 is a polytope of dimension @xmath237 and @xmath12 is a face of it of dimension @xmath238 .",
    "they satisfy all the properties stated in theorem [ thm : polytope ] .",
    "[ rem : semi - interior ] the reader may wonder about the combinatorics of the polyhedron @xmath28 that one would obtain with the equations of the generic case .",
    "clearly , the tight graphs of its faces will not contain any of the four forbidden subgraphs of lemma [ lemma : excluded ] .",
    "it can be checked that the maximal marked graphs without those subgraphs all have @xmath33 edges plus marks and have the following characterization : as graphs they are pseudo - triangulations in which all the semi - interior vertices are incident to interior edges , and they have marks at all the boundary points and at the pointed interior points . in other words , they would be the fully - marked pseudo - triangulations if we treated semi - interior points exactly as interior ones , hence forbidding them to be incident to two angles of 180 degrees and considering them always pointed since they are incident to one angle of 180 degrees .",
    "this implies that the polyhedron @xmath28 is still simple .",
    "the reason why we prefer the definitions we have given is that the polyhedron no longer has a unique maximal bounded face ( it has three in the example of figure [ fig:6pts - b ] ) and the graph of flips is no longer regular .",
    "observe finally that the proof of theorem [ thm : rigidintro ] given at the end of section [ section : polyhedron ] is valid for points in special position , without much change : in all cases the hyperplanes corresponding to the edges of a pseudo - triangulation are independent in @xmath26 .",
