    "statistical mechanics and complex network theory have been applied to different disciplines , ranging from biology to sociology . from this perspective",
    ", social systems are modelled as a collection of agents , located at the nodes of a network , interacting through simple rules .",
    "social networks of human interaction are structured into cohesive groups @xcite , and increased knowledge of this structure @xcite has sparked the creation of new network models @xcite .",
    "these models allow us to study the effect of the structure of social interactions on the dynamics taking place on the networks , and on the associated collective phenomena emerging from the interactions among the agents .",
    "the mesoscopic structure of a social network , and in particular its community structure , has been found to influence dynamics taking place on it in ways that can not be explained by global level statistics in several cases @xcite . in this paper",
    "we address the role of such mesoscopic structure on ordering dynamics or consensus processes : the question is when the interaction of agents with several options leads to an ordered state with a single option ( consensus ) or when disordered states ( possibly metastable ) , with coexistent options prevail .",
    "we consider two dynamical models .",
    "the first one is the prototype _ voter model _ @xcite whose dynamics in complex networks is known to be generally determined by global properties such as the effective network dimensionality @xcite .",
    "secondly , we consider the _ ab model _",
    "@xcite introduced to describe language competition , which gives a natural context for the community concept .",
    "these two dynamical models are studied in a class of networks @xcite incorporating nontrivial community structure which introduces structural correlations .",
    "the _ voter model _ @xcite concerns the competition of two equivalent but excluding options a and b. the state of a node is updated by imitation of a randomly chosen neighbor . the _ ab model _",
    "@xcite includes a third non - excluding mixed ab state , with the additional rule that a node can not change state from a to b or vice versa without going through the ab state . in studies of dynamics of language competition",
    ", the voter model gives a microscopic version @xcite of the abrams - strogatz @xcite model for the competition of two socially equivalent languages . in this context the third state of non - excluding options of the _ ab model _ is naturally associated with bilingualism @xcite .",
    "more generally the _ ab model _ describes competition of two equivalent social norms which can coexist at the individual level .    in both models ,",
    "an agent changes its state with a probability which depends on the states of its neighbors .",
    "the fraction of first neighbors in state a [ b , ab ] of an agent is called the _ local density _ of a , @xmath0 [ @xmath1 , @xmath2 . for the voter model ,",
    "the state ab is not allowed and the probabilities of a node changing state are defined as follows : @xmath3 the ab model is defined by the following update rules : @xmath4    in our simulations we start from random initial conditions for the state of the agents in a network with @xmath5 nodes ( see below ) and we use random asynchronous node update : at each time step a single node is randomly chosen and updated according to the transition probabilities eq .",
    "( [ eq : voter ] ) or eqs .",
    "( [ eq : aba])-([eq : abb ] ) .",
    "we normalize time so that every unit of time includes @xmath5 time steps .",
    "a question of interest is under which conditions consensus is reached ( all nodes hold the same option ) , and which is the process of emergence and growth of spatial domains where the nodes are in the same state ( _ coarsening _ )",
    ". both models are symmetric by interchange of a and b , so that reaching consensus in either of these two states is a symmetry breaking process . to describe the dynamics of the system we use as order parameter the _ interface density _",
    "@xmath6 , which is defined as the fraction of links which connect nodes in different states .",
    "the ensemble average interface density @xmath7 is considered , where the ensemble average , indicated as @xmath8 , denotes average over realizations of the stochastic dynamics starting from different random initial conditions .",
    "interface density decreases as domains grow in size .",
    "if one of the states becomes dominant , the interface density decreases along with the disappearing state .",
    "zero interface density indicates that an absorbing state , consensus , has been reached .",
    "coarsening in the voter model is driven by interfacial noise , while for the ab model earlier results indicate that coarsening is curvature driven : boundaries tend to straighten out , reducing curvature and leading to the growth of spatial domains @xcite .",
    "it turns out that domains of ab agents are never formed . instead ,",
    "ab agents place themselves in the interface between a and b domains .",
    "the dependence of the voter model dynamics on network dimensionality , disorder and degree distribution has been carefully studied @xcite .",
    "a main result is that @xmath9 is the critical dimensionality for this model .",
    "this means that for @xmath10 there is coarsening , i.e. unbounded growth ( in the thermodynamic limit ) of domains in which all nodes are in the same state .",
    "however for @xmath11 there is no coarsening beyond an initial transient . in finite networks of @xmath11 there",
    "exist long - lived metastable states in which @xmath6 takes a plateau value .",
    "the inverse of this plateau value is the characteristic size of coexisting a and b domains .",
    "eventually a finite size fluctuation takes the system to one of the two consensus absorbing states .",
    "we note that complex networks are typically high dimensional structures for which these metastable states naturally occur @xcite .",
    "coarsening processes leading to consensus often come to a halt due to the appearance of metastable states that can be of different nature .",
    "coarsening and metastable properties depend on the dynamical model as well as on network characteristics .",
    "the type of metastability encountered for the voter model is characterized by the fact that all realizations of the process are of the same class ( qualitatively similar ) and that the metastable states have a finite lifetime for a finite system .",
    "for the voter model the mean lifetime of these states scales as @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "we call this type of metastable states _ dynamical metastable states_. a different type of metastability , which we call _ trapped metastable states _ , occurs in situations in which different realizations of the process are of different type . while some of them follow a coarsening process until finite size effects come into play , others get stuck in topological traps .",
    "the latter correspond to trapped metastable states that can be of two types : they might have a finite lifetime in finite systems , as it occurs for the _ ab model _ with stripe - like configurations in regular two dimensional lattices @xcite , or they might be infinitely long lived as it occurs in zero temperature kinetic ising models @xcite . in summary ,",
    "different forms of metastability can appear for the voter and _ ab _ models considered here , but every realization is expected to have a finite lifetime in a finite system .",
    "several models have been designed to capture some of the characteristics of social networks , based on mechanisms such as geographical proximity @xcite , social similarity @xcite , and local search @xcite .",
    "a combination of random attachment with local search for new contacts has proved fruitful in generating cohesive structures as well as well - known features of social networks , such as assortativity , broad degree distributions , and community structure @xcite .",
    "the term `` community '' is typically used in the context of groups of nodes with dense internal and sparse external connections ; exact definitions differ @xcite .",
    "the community structure leads naturally to high values of the clustering coefficient and to positive degree - degree correlations .",
    "the algorithm to generate this class of networks consists of two growth processes : 1 ) random attachment , and 2 ) implicit preferential attachment resulting from following edges from the randomly chosen initial contacts .",
    "the local nature of the second process gives rise to high clustering , assortativity and community structure .",
    "starting from any small connected seed network of @xmath13 vertices , new nodes are added as follows ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : schematic ] ) : i ) pick @xmath14 random nodes as initial contacts .",
    "ii ) pick @xmath15 neighbors of each initial contact as secondary contacts .",
    "iii ) connect the new node to the initial and secondary contacts .",
    "links to one or more randomly chosen initial contacts ( here @xmath16 ) and possibly to some of their neighbors ( here @xmath17 ) . ]    throughout this paper , we will use the _ standard parameters _",
    "@xcite : the number of initial contacts is selected according to the probabilities @xmath18 , @xmath19 ; and the number of secondary contacts from each initial contact , @xmath20 , is chosen from a uniform probability distribution between 0 and 3 ; the initial seed contains @xmath21 nodes .",
    "the degree distributions of the resulting networks are found to decay slower than exponential @xcite . using the @xmath22-clique algorithm @xcite for detecting communities , a broad distribution of community sizes",
    "is found in the model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : snowball ] ) .    for reference , we use randomized versions of the same networks , where the degree sequence is kept intact but edges are randomly rewired under the restriction that the network must stay connected @xcite .",
    "this eliminates community structure , clustering , and degree correlations .",

    "we followed the development over time of the interface density and of the fraction of runs that had not yet reached consensus at any particular time .",
    "when results for the original and randomized networks differ , we can conclude that structural characteristics other than the degree distribution are responsible for the differences .",
    "the average interface density @xmath29 on the class of networks considered here , and on their randomized counterparts is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : interfacedensity ] . for the voter model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : interfacedensity]a ) , we obtain that the structure of the network does not alter the qualitative behavior . in both classes of networks we observe plateau values of @xmath30 associated with dynamical metastable states . still , the plateau value for networks with community structure is lower than for the randomized networks , indicating that the typical size of spatial domains where agents are in the same state is larger .",
    "we also observe in both cases that finite size fluctuations drive the system to an absorbing state . the characteristic time to reach consensus ( mean lifetime of the metastable state ) depends on network size but it does not depend sensitively on network structure .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : interfacedensity]a shows that the time to reach consensus depends linearly on network size for networks with communities and their randomized counterparts .",

    "figure  [ fig : interfacedensity]b shows the average interface density for the ab dynamics .",
    "we observe significant differences between the original and the randomized version networks : a plateau value of @xmath29 is observed for randomized networks , while a first dynamical stage of coarsening where spatial domains grow in size is found for large networks with communities .",
    "the plateau observed in randomized networks indicates that a dynamical metastable state of the class found in the voter model for both types of networks is rapidly reached .",
    "moreover , in the randomized networks there is a fast decay towards an absorbing state with a characteristic time to reach consensus almost independent of system size . for the networks with a community structure we observe two dynamical stages in the evolution of @xmath7 . after an initial power law associated with coarsening there appears a second power law tail in the approach to the absorbing state .",
    "this last power law decay indicates that the mean lifetime to reach consensus for the ab model does not characterize the dynamics on these networks and that metastable states exist at all time scales , as we discuss below .",
    "additionally , the difference with the randomized networks in several orders of magnitude for the extinction times , which increases with system size , shows that the network with communities slows down the dynamics significantly .",
    "all together these results manifest a sensitivity of the ab dynamics to the mesoscopic network structure which is not found for the voter dynamics .",
    "figure  [ fig : aliveruns ] shows the fraction @xmath41 of realizations still alive at time _",
    "i.e. the fraction of realizations which have not reached the absorbing state . for the voter model , the fraction of alive runs decreases exponentially in both the original and randomized networks ( fig .",
    "[ fig : aliveruns]-inset ) , in agreement with previous results for the voter model in high dimensional complex networks @xcite .",
    "a rather different result is found for the ab model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : aliveruns ] ) . in our class of networks",
    ", we find a power law behavior @xmath42 , so that a mean lifetime of the realizations of the ab dynamics does not give a characteristic time scale . at any time",
    "there are live realizations which have not reached the absorbing state .",
    "different parametrizations of the network model ( not shown ) produce the same qualitative phenomenon : we have modified the number of secondary contacts from each initial contact , @xmath20 , using uniform probability distributions between 0 and @xmath43 , obtaining also a power law of the distribution of alive runs with an exponent smaller than 2 , which indicates the robustness of this result . this behavior is different from the usual exponential decay of the tails of @xmath41 observed for the voter , and ab dynamics either in regular , small world @xcite , random or barabsi - albert scale - free networks ( not shown ) , and reflects the existence of metastable states at all time scales .",
    "this fact indicates that the anomalous lifetime distribution is linked to the structure of the network at a mesoscopic level .",
    "such structure seems to give rise to a number of traps that cause trapped metastable states at all time scales . to substantiate this claim we next look at some detailed dynamics .",
    "further understanding of the dynamical process can be obtained by considering the measure called overlap , @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "this characteristic of a link between two nodes tells us essentially which fraction of their neighbors is shared by the nodes . within a community , nodes tend to share many neighbors , and thus overlap is high , while edges between communities will have low or zero overlap .",
    "considering dynamics of competing options on a network , the overlap can be used to identify spatially homogenous domains in the network : if the average overlap @xmath45 of the links in the interface between domains is low , we may assume that the domain boundaries follow the community boundaries .",
    "on the other hand , if the overlap at the interfaces is high , it indicates that nodes within communities are in different states . for the voter model dynamics",
    "we have found that the average overlap of interface links drops to about 80 percent of the average value @xmath46 of the whole network , while in the ab model it drops to under 70 percent .",
    "this indicates that in both models the interfaces between domains lie preferably in low overlap links , so that domains of the same option follow the community structure , but in the ab model these domains are correlated with the communities closer .    ,",

    "the difference between the two dynamics is better understood by looking at snapshots of the dynamics ( fig .",
    "[ fig : snapshots ] ) which show the characteristic behavior for each of the models , starting from random initial conditions ( @xmath48 ) . in the voter model ( left )",

    "[ fig : n50_greenthing]a , inset ) is not sensitive to the details of the network structure . for the ab model",
    "some realizations of the network topology produce particularly long lived metastable states , while in others , corresponding to exponential - like decay of @xmath29 , they are observed rarely .",
    "plots of the interface density of individual runs on a given network show a class of realizations with different plateaus ( ordering levels ) where the system gets trapped for a long time ( fig .",
    "[ fig : n50_greenthing]b ) . these trapped metastable states , analogous to those displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : snapshots]-right , correspond to the structure in the network .",
    "the variety of traps and associated different lifetimes seems to be the mechanism that causes an anomalous power law distribution for the lifetimes .",
    "we note that although the details of each network realization matter for the occurrence of trapped metastable states , the community size distribution detected by the _ k_-clique - percolation method @xcite is the same for all the network realizations that we have considered .",
    "this and other available statistical methods seem not to be sufficient to discern between the network topologies producing many or few trapped metastable states .",
    "we have considered two dynamical models , the voter and the ab model , in order to study metastable states and the role of community structure in the dynamics of consensus processes .",
    "the voter model dynamics , driven by interfacial noise , is not particularly sensitive to the mesoscopic structure of the network : we find that all realizations of the dynamics are of the same class , leading to a type of dynamical metastable states shared by other complex networks of high dimensionality without degree correlations . on the contrary , for the ab dynamics we find different classes of realizations leading to a power law distribution for the times to reach consensus .",
    "this is explained in terms of trapped metastable states associated with the structure of the network .",
    "our result implies that a mean lifetime for these states does not give a characteristic time scale of the ordering dynamics .",
    "we note that a mean lifetime does not exist for the zero - temperature kinetic ising model dynamics on regular or complex networks @xcite , due to realizations that lead to trapped metastable states of infinite lifetime in finite systems .",
    "the novelty of our finding is that we have realizations with any lifetime . for the ab model in a regular 2d lattice",
    "trapped metastable states with stripe - like configuration have been found @xcite , but in that case the distribution of lifetimes is exponential : @xmath55 and the mean lifetime is representative of the dynamics .",
    "the power - law distribution for the lifetimes originates here in the multiplicity of different traps that reflects the mesoscopic structure of the networks .",
    "simpler configurations of community structure should be considered in the future in order to gain a deeper understanding of the microscopic mechanisms underlying consensus dynamics .",
