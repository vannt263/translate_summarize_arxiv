    "( anti-)strangeness enhancement was first observed at cern - sps energies by comparing anti - hyperons , multi - strange baryons , and kaons to @xmath10-data .",
    "it was considered a signature for quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) because , using binary strangeness production and exchange reactions , chemical equilibrium could not be reached within a standard hadron gas phase , i.e. , the chemical equilibration time was on the order of @xmath11 whereas the lifetime of a fireball in the hadronic stages is only @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "it was then proposed that there exists a strong hint for qgp at sps because strange quarks can be produced more abundantly by gluon fusion , which would account for strangeness enhancement following hadronization and rescattering of strange quarks .",
    "later , however , multi - mesonic reactions were used to explain secondary production of @xmath13 and anti - hyperons @xcite . at sps",
    "they give a chemical equilibration time @xmath14 using an annihilation cross section of @xmath15 and a baryon density of @xmath16 , which is typical for evolving strongly interacting matter at sps before chemical freeze - out .",
    "therefore , the time scale is short enough to account for chemical equilibration within a cooling hadronic fireball at sps .",
    "a problem arises when the same multi - mesonic reactions were employed in the hadron gas phase at rhic temperatures where experiments again show that the particle abundances reach chemical equilibration close to the phase transition @xcite . at rhic at @xmath17 mev , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 , the equilibrium rate for ( anti-)baryon production is @xmath20 .",
    "moreover , @xmath20 was also obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite using a fluctuation - dissipation theorem . from hadron cascades a significant deviation was found from the chemically saturated strange ( anti-)baryons yields in the @xmath21 most central au - au collisions @xcite .",
    "these discrepancies suggest that hadrons are  born \" into equilibrium , i.e. , the system is already in a chemically frozen out state at the end of the phase transition @xcite . in order to circumvent such long time",
    "scales it was suggested that near @xmath22 there exists an extra large particle density overpopulated with pions and kaons , which drive the baryons / anti - baryons into equilibrium @xcite .",
    "but it is not clear how this overpopulation should appear , and how the subsequent population of ( anti-)baryons would follow . moreover",
    ", the overpopulated ( anti-)baryons do not later disappear @xcite .",
    "therefore , it was conjectured that hagedorn resonances ( heavy resonances near @xmath23 with an exponential mass spectrum ) could account for the extra ( anti-)baryons @xcite .",
    "hadrons can develop according to @xmath24 where @xmath25 can be substituted with @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , or @xmath3 .",

    "( [ eqn : decay ] ) , @xmath26 is the number of pions for the decay @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the number of pions that a hagedorn state will decay into when a @xmath25 is present . since hagedorn resonances are highly unstable",
    ", the phase space for multi - particle decays drastically increases when the mass increases .",
    "therefore , the resonances catalyze rapid equilibration of @xmath25 near @xmath23 and die out moderately below @xmath29 @xcite .    unlike in pure glue @xmath30 gauge theory where the polyakov loop is the order parameter for the deconfinement transition ( which is weakly first - order ) , the rapid crossover seen on lattice calculations involving dynamical fermions indicates that there is not a well defined order parameter that can distinguish the confined phase from the deconfined phase . because of this it is natural to look for a hadronic mechanism for quick chemical equilibration near the phase transition .",
    "one such possibility could be the inclusion of hagedorn states .",
    "recently , hagedorn states have been shown to contribute to the physical description of a hadron gas close to @xmath29 .",
    "the inclusion of hagedorn states leads to a low @xmath31 in the hadron gas phase @xcite , which nears the string theory bound @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "calculations of the trace anomaly including hagedorn states also fits recent lattice results well and correctly describe the minimum of the speed of sound squared , @xmath33 near the phase transition found on the lattice @xcite .",
    "estimates for the bulk viscosity including hagedorn states in the hadron gas phase indicate that the bulk viscosity , @xmath34 , increases near @xmath29 , which agrees with the general analysis done in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown @xcite that hagedorn states provide a better fit within a thermal model to the hadron yield particle ratios .",
    "additionally , hagedorn states provide a mechanism to relate @xmath29 and @xmath35 , which then leads to the suggestion that a lower critical temperature could possibly be preferred , according to the thermal fits @xcite .",
    "previously , in ref .  @xcite we presented analytical results , which we will derive in detail here .",
    "moreover , we saw that both the baryons and kaons equilibrated quickly within an expanding fireball .",
    "the initial saturation of pions , hagedorn states , baryons , and kaons played no significant role in the ratios such as @xmath7 and @xmath36 .    here",
    "we consider the effects of various initial conditions on the chemical freeze - out temperature and we find that while they play a small role on the total particle number , they still reproduce fast chemical equilibration times .",
    "additionally , we assume lattice values of the critical temperatures ( @xmath4 mev @xcite and @xmath5 mev @xcite ) and find that chemical equilibrium abundances are still reached close to the temperature given by thermal fits ( @xmath37 mev ) .",

    "<S> quick chemical equilibration times of hadrons ( specifically , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 pairs ) within a hadron gas are explained dynamically using hagedorn states , which drive particles into equilibrium close to the critical temperature . within this scheme , </S>",
    "<S> we use master equations and derive various analytical estimates for the chemical equilibration times . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our model to recent lattice results and find that for both @xmath4 mev and @xmath5 mev , the hadrons can reach chemical equilibrium almost immediately , well before the chemical freeze - out temperatures found in thermal fits for a hadron gas without hagedorn states . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore the ratios @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 match experimental values well in our dynamical scenario . </S>"
