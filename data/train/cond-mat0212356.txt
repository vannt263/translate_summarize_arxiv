    "evaporative cooling is an essential experimental technique in the recent demonstrations of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) with magnetically trapped atomic vapor @xcite .",
    "this cooling method is based on both the selective removal of energetic atoms through evaporation and collisional rethermalizations among remaining atoms @xcite .",
    "the successful utilization of interatomic elastic collisions makes evaporative cooling highly efficient .",
    "a real system , however , involves other atomic collisions , such as elastic collisions with background gas , inelastic collisions due to dipolar relaxation and three - body recombination processes .",
    "these undesirable collisions result in a loss of the trapped atoms and seriously reduce the effectiveness of evaporative cooling .    for alkali - metal atoms , such as @xmath0rb and @xmath1na ,",
    "three - body recombination becomes a dominant loss mechanism during evaporative cooling @xcite , and limits the final number of condensed atoms , @xmath2 , in the experiments .",
    "it is known that @xmath0rb atoms suffer much severer losses than @xmath1na atoms due to their much large rate coefficient of three - body recombination process @xcite .",
    "bec experiments have clearly reflected this fact : the reported @xmath2 value in @xmath0rb is @xmath3 at most @xcite , while that in @xmath1na is up to @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the small bec of @xmath0rb is a great disadvantage with respect to its future application as an `` atom laser\"@xcite and has to be overcome .    in this paper , we report the theoretical optimization of evaporative cooling , focusing on bec experiments with @xmath0rb atoms .",
    "several theoretical works have considered the optimization of evaporative cooling to increase the cooling efficiency @xcite . especially , ref .",
    "@xcite optimized the evaporative cooling in atomic hydrogen not only theoretically but also experimentally .",
    "however , these studies are based on kinetic theory of a classical gas which fails around the bec transition point , and therefore do nt give us any information on the number of condensed atoms produced by evaporative cooling .",
    "our analysis is based on quantum kinetic theory of a bose gas @xcite and can provide quantitative results on the increase in the number of condensed atoms by optimizing the evaporative cooling .",

    "we show that an accelerated sweep of the rf - field frequency around the bec transition point can largely enhance the final number of condensed atoms compared with conventional cooling with an exponential sweep of the frequency .",
    "it is also demonstrated that highly efficient evaporative cooling can be achieved by an initial exponential and then a rapid linear sweep of frequency .",

    "we begin with a review of our theoretical formulation @xcite . during evaporative cooling , a magnetic potential , @xmath5 ,",
    "is truncated depending on the frequency of the applied rf - magnetic field .",
    "the thermalized distribution of noncondensed atoms in such a truncated potential is well approximated by the truncated bose - einstein distribution function such that @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the temperature , @xmath8 is the kinetic energy of atoms with momentum @xmath9 and mass @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is a step function . in this paper , we add tilde to the notations of the quantities evaluated through this truncated distribution function .",

    "the step function eliminates the momentum states whose kinetic energy exceeds the effective potential height @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the truncation energy of a magnetic potential .",
    "we calculate the density profile of atoms using this truncated distribution function in a self - consistent way such that @xmath20 and the internal energy density similarly as @xmath21 the spatial integrations of these density functions give the total number of atoms , @xmath22 , and the total internal energy , @xmath23 respectively .",
    "after the bec transition , the atom density in the condensed region is obtained by the sum of a condensate @xmath24 and saturated noncondensed atoms @xmath25 such that @xmath26 .",
    "the condensate is described by the thomas - fermi distribution @xmath27 with the peak density of the condensate at the center of potential @xmath28 , while @xmath25 is evaluated through the truncated bose - einstein distribution function with the condition @xmath29 .",
    "the dynamics of trapped atoms during evaporative cooling is investigated on the basis of quantum kinetic theory of a bose gas , developed previously by the present authors @xcite .",
    "trapped atoms are removed from the potential by not only evaporation but also undesirable collisions , as mentioned in the introduction .",

    "the terms proportional to the change rate of truncation energy , @xmath38 , give the contribution of extra atoms `` spilled over \" when @xmath19 changes continuously in the forced evaporative cooling @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the evaporative cooling including the loss of trapped atoms is described by the coupled differential equations in eq .",
    "( [ difeq ] ) . in our theoretical framework based on truncated bose - einstein distribution function , all thermodynamic quantities are given as the complicated functions of three independent variables : temperature @xmath7 , chemical potential @xmath39 , and truncation energy @xmath19 .",

    "( [ difeq ] ) , we clearly see that the terms proportional to @xmath43 are canceled out and both @xmath41 and @xmath42 are determined by three variables @xmath7 , @xmath39 , and @xmath19 .",
    "the optimum cooling trajectory in the evaporative cooling process is obtained approximately by following the instantaneous optimization procedure investigated in ref . @xcite .",
    "we determine the optimized cooling trajectory so as to achieve the maximum increase in phase - space density @xmath44 with the smallest decrease in the number of trapped atoms @xmath45 . in the nonuniform gas system ,",
    "the phase - space density is evaluated at the peak position and given by @xmath46 with the thermal de broglie wavelength @xmath47 . at each time",
    ", we calculate the optimum truncation energy @xmath48 by maximizing the derivative , @xmath49 ) , which describes the efficiency of evaporative cooling @xcite .",
    "we use a more useful form of this derivative rewritten in terms of change rates of temperature , chemical potential , and truncation energy as , @xmath50 in the optimized evaporative cooling , the truncation parameter @xmath51 changes more slowly than the variables @xmath7 , @xmath39 , and @xmath19 .",

    "the time - evolution calculations are carried out numerically by repeating a series of steps consisting of instantaneous optimization and dynamical short - time evolution of eq .",
    "( [ difeq ] ) with the temporal value of @xmath48 .",
    "furthermore we assume quick rethermalization , where the system is always described by the truncated distribution function @xcite .",
    "the obtained function @xmath53 corresponds to the optimized sweeping function of the rf - field frequency .    in the next section",
    ", we will show the numerical results calculated by using relevant experimental parameters and discuss the experimental possibility of making large condensates in @xmath0rb atoms .",
    "in our numerical calculations , we employed parameters corresponding to the experiments performed at the university of tokyo @xcite .",
    "the cloverleaf magnetic trap with bias field @xmath54 , radial gradient @xmath55 , and axial curvature @xmath56 was modeled by the magnetic field of ioffe - pritchard type such that @xmath57 , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "we used the typical values adopted experimentally , such as @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .",
    "the corresponding trapping frequencies are @xmath63  hz in the radial direction , and @xmath64  hz in the axial direction .",
    "the collisional parameters for the trapped @xmath65 state were set as follows @xcite : _ s_-wave scattering length @xmath66 nm , loss rate constants due to background gas collisions @xmath67 , dipolar relaxation @xmath68 , and three - body recombination @xmath69 .",
    "we chose the temperature @xmath70k , the peak density @xmath71 @xmath72 , and the number of trapped atoms @xmath73 as the initial evaporative cooling conditions .",
    "the exponential sweep of the rf - field frequency is usually adopted in bec experiments @xcite .",
    "we also performed calculations assuming that the frequency , @xmath74 , is swept exponentially from 35 to 0.67 mhz in 60 s as in ref.@xcite .",
    "the comparison between the different sweeps of rf - field frequency , optimized or exponential , will clarify the merit of the present optimization procedure .",
    "figure 1 shows each sweep of the rf - field frequency .",
    "we see that the sweeping time ( i.e. , the cooling time ) in the optimized case is about half that of exponential - sweep cooling for 60 s. the shorter sweeping time in the optimized cooling is advantageous for bec experiments since the long time evaporative cooling easily becomes inefficient due to the instability of the magnetic trap .",
    "furthermore , it is found that the optimized frequency sweep becomes rapid at the final stage of the cooling process , i.e. , after about 27 s , and such a sweep is quite opposite to the exponential one which slows down over time . as shown in the inset of fig .  1",
    ", the optimization procedure accelerates the evaporation around the bec transition point .",
    "similar acceleration of evaporation at the final stage of optimized cooling has been also demonstrated by the previous studies based on kinetic theory of a classical gas @xcite .    in figs .",
    "2(a ) and 2(b ) , we show the time evolution of the number of trapped atoms @xmath45 and that of temperature @xmath7 , respectively . in the optimized cooling ,",
    "both @xmath45 and @xmath7 rapidly decrease at the final stage of cooling due to the rapid evaporation mentioned above . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath45 and @xmath7 decrease monotonically in the exponential cooling case . at the bec transition point indicated by the dots in the figure , both",
    "the number of trapped atoms and temperature are calculated to be @xmath75 and @xmath76k at 29.01 s for the optimized cooling , and @xmath77 and @xmath78k at 48.9 s for the exponential cooling .",
    "next , we show how the optimization affects the cooling efficiency in the whole evaporative cooling process . in fig .  3 ,",
    "the cooling trajectories of both cases are plotted in the @xmath45-@xmath44 plane and several corresponding time values are also added to the cooling trajectories to demonstrate the time evolution . at the early stage of cooling where the loss due to background gas collisions is dominant ,",
    "both trajectories are quite similar , indicating that the exponential sweep of rf - field frequency is sufficiently good .",
    "however , the difference becomes larger as the trajectories approach the quantum degenerate region where the phase - space density exceeds the critical value of @xmath79 and bose statistics of atoms becomes dominant .",
    "clearly , more atoms are lost in conventional exponential - sweep cooling than in the optimized case .",
    "for example , we have ten times larger number of atoms in the optimized cooling at the bec transition point when the trajectory reaches the horizontal line of @xmath80 .",
    "note that the point where the two trajectories split up in fig .  3 ( i.e. , @xmath81 ) corresponds to the time of around 28 s where the rf - field frequency curves cross in fig .  1 .",
    "the sudden increase in phase - space density just after the bec transition in both trajectories reflects the rapid growth of condensate due to bosonic stimulation .",
    "the number of condensed atoms , @xmath2 , is largely increased by the optimization . in the optimized cooling , @xmath2 increased monotonically and we obtained @xmath82 after 29.04-s cooling . in the exponential - sweep cooling , on the other hand , @xmath2 had the maximum value of @xmath83 at 57.0 s and then gradually decreased .",
    "we finally obtained @xmath84 for 60-s exponential sweep cooling .",
    "more than a 100-fold enhancement of the number of condensed atoms was achieved in our present calculations .",
    "the lifetime of such a large condensate is evaluated to be less than 100 ms due to the enormous three - body recombination loss , as we will see in fig .",
    "however , it is possible to resolve this problem by adiabatically expanding the trapping potential .",
    "we also add that the value of @xmath85 quantitatively agrees with the experimental results reported in ref.@xcite and confirms the validity of our numerical calculations .",
    "the undesirable loss of trapped atoms during the cooling process gives us the physical origin of the rapid frequency sweep in the optimized cooling .",
    "figure 4 shows the time evolution of loss rates of total number of trapped atoms at the final stage of the optimized cooling .",
    "it is seen that the loss due to the three - body recombination greatly increases and selectively removes atoms with high density ( i.e. , atoms with lower energy ) .",
    "this means that the serious heating of the system is caused by three - body recombination loss . in order to get a large number of condensed atoms , evaporative cooling",
    "should therefore be accelerated to compensate for such undesirable heating .    here",
    ", we briefly discuss the validity of the quick rethermalization assumption in the rapid evaporation necessary for optimized cooling .",
    "the evolution of the system in the evaporative cooling process is well scaled by the characteristic time @xmath86 given by the inverse of normalized loss rate as @xmath87 .",
    "the thermalization of the system , on the other hand , is characterized by the elastic collision time @xmath88 ; @xmath89 is the mean atom density , @xmath90 is the elastic collision cross section , and @xmath91 is the mean velocity of relative motion of the atoms @xcite . at the bec transition point in the optimized cooling ,",
    "these characteristic times are calculated to be @xmath92 ms and @xmath93 ms , respectively .",
    "the relation @xmath94 confirms that quick rethermalization is still valid during the rapid evaporation that occurs for optimized cooling .      the optimized frequency sweep in fig .",
    "1 is the complicated function of the experimental parameters such as the temperature , the density of gas , the atomic collisional parameters , the magnetic trapping potential , and so on .",
    "this means that we need to calculate the optimized cooling for each bec experiment depending on its experimental conditions .",
    "here we try to demonstrate the efficient evaporative cooling based on general sweeping functions of rf - field frequency , which is useful for many experimentalists who want to achieve large condensates .",
    "from the results in figs .  3 and 4 , the exponential sweep is highly efficient until the three - body recombination loss becomes dominant .",
    "the rapid frequency sweep at the final stage of the optimized cooling in fig .  1 might be approximated by a linear function .",
    "thus it is expected that a combination of an exponential sweep of rf frequency and a rapid linear one realizes the high cooling efficiency . to test this cooling method",
    ", we carried out the time - evolution calculation by applying the same numerical parameters used in the optimization calculation of the proceeding subsection .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "5(a ) , the frequency is first swept exponentially from 35 mhz to 2.26 mhz for 27 s and then swept linearly to 0.67 mhz for three different times of 1 s , 5 s , and 10 s respectively . the exponential curve in fig .",
    "5(a ) is in conformity with the corresponding part of the dashed line in fig .",
    "1 .    figure 5(b ) shows the cooling trajectories in the @xmath45-@xmath44 plane for the evaporative cooling using the sweeping functions of fig .",
    "5(a ) , together with those for the optimized and exponential cooling plotted in fig .  3 .",
    "we can see that the linear frequency sweep at the final stage of the evaporative cooling strongly improves the cooling efficiency as expected .",
    "especially , the cooling trajectory in the case of 27-s exponential and 1-s linear frequency sweep ( dashed line ) is very close to the optimized one ( solid line ) .",
    "the final number of condensed atoms in this cooling method is calculated to be @xmath95 and comparable to the value in the optimized cooling such as @xmath96 .",
    "one can achieve the evaporative cooling with sufficiently high efficiency by an initial exponential and a sequential rapid linear sweep of rf - field frequency .",
    "recently , a group at gakushuin university performed the efficient evaporative cooling for @xmath0rb atoms with f=2 , @xmath97 trapped state @xcite .",
    "they applied a frequency sweep similar to the optimized one which we calculated according to their experimental situations .",
    "the time of evaporative cooling was divided into three segments and in each segment the optimized sweeping function was approximated by the linear one : the frequency was swept linearly like 32 @xmath9813 @xmath98 2 @xmath991.1 mhz for 10 , 10 , and 5 s respectively .",
    "a large number of condensed atoms , @xmath100 , were finally obtained after this 25-s evaporative cooling starting from the experimental conditions such as initial temperature @xmath101 , initial total number of atoms @xmath102 , and initial phase - space density @xmath103 .    on the other hand",
    ", we theoretically investigated this evaporative cooling .",
    "it was found that the cooling trajectory through phase space is close to that of optimized cooling and the final 5-s linear sweep of rf - frequency enhances the phase space density more than four orders of magnitude .",
    "the number of condensed atoms for this 25-s evaporative cooling was calculated to be @xmath104 .",
    "our calculated results agree well with the experiment at gakushuin university .",
    "we have theoretically studied the optimization of evaporative cooling on the basis of quantum kinetic theory of a bose gas , focusing on bec experiments with rubidium atoms .",
    "the calculated results indicate that the acceleration of evaporative cooling around the bec transition point is very effective against serious three - body recombination loss .",
    "the number of condensed atoms is expected to be largely increased by this optimization procedure .",
    "furthermore , it is shown that highly efficient evaporative cooling can be achieved by an initial exponential and then a rapid linear sweep of frequency .",
    "these results are consistent with the experiments and provide a useful guideline to experimentalists aiming to achieve large condensates in @xmath0rb atoms .    in the present work , we optimized the sweeping function of the rf - field frequency only .",
    "a more complete optimization together with the adiabatic change of trapping potential curvature might produce a large and long - lived condensate . on the other hand",
    ", our theory neglects the influence of gravity which reduces the cooling efficiency at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "an interesting future work would be to include the gravity in our present kinetic analysis and study how the optimized cooling trajectory is modified by it .",
