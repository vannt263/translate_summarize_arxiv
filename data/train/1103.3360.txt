    "in iron pnictide superconductors @xcite , both spin and orbital degrees of freedom play important roles on various electronic properties , such as the high-@xmath0 superconductivity , orthorhombic structure transition , and magnetic transition . as for the origin of the superconductivity , fully - gapped sign - reversing @xmath3-wave ( @xmath7-wave )",
    "state had been studied based on spin fluctuation theories @xcite .",
    "the origin of the spin fluctuations is the intra - orbital nesting and the coulomb interaction .",
    "however , the robustness of @xmath0 against randomness in iron pnictides indicates the absence of sign - reversal in the superconducting ( sc ) gap @xcite .",
    "later , orbital - fluctuation - mediated @xmath3-wave state without sign reversal ( @xmath4-wave ) had been proposed based on the hubbard - holstein ( hh ) model @xcite .",
    "the origin of the orbital fluctuations is the inter - orbital nesting and the electron - phonon ( @xmath8-ph ) interactions due to non-@xmath9 optical phonons .",
    "one of the merits of this scenario is the robustness of the @xmath4-wave state against impurities .",
    "another merit is that the close relation between @xmath0 and the crystal structure revealed by lee @xcite , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath0 becomes the highest when the as@xmath10 cluster is regular tetrahedron , is automatically explained @xcite . moreover ,",
    "orbital - fluctuation - mediated @xmath4-wave state scenario is consistent with the large sc gap on the @xmath11-orbital band in ba122 systems @xcite , observed by bulk - sensitive laser arpes measurement @xcite .",
    "the `` resonance - like '' hump structure in the neutron inelastic scattering @xcite is frequently explained as the spin - resonance due to the sign reversal in the sc gap @xcite .",
    "however , experimental hump structure is well reproduced in terms of the @xmath4-wave sc state , rather than the @xmath7-wave sc state , by taking the suppression in the inelastic scattering @xmath12 for @xmath13 in the sc state ( dissipationless mechanism ) @xcite . to distinguish between both sc states , measurements of phonon spectral function for @xmath14 would be useful @xcite . in the normal state , prominent non - fermi liquid transport phenomena in @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xcite are frequently ascribed to the evidence of spin fluctuations @xcite .",
    "however , they are also explained by the development of antiferro - orbital fluctuations @xcite .    in order to identify the mechanism of superconductivity , we have to understand the origin of the ordered state , although it is still unsolved in iron pnictides . for example , in many heavy fermion superconductors , the sc phase appears next to the spin - density - wave ( sdw ) state , indicating the occurrence of spin - fluctuation - mediated superconductivity .",
    "in contrast , the ordered state in iron pnictides is not a simple sdw state : in fact , the tetragonal to orthorhombic structure transition occurs at @xmath17 k , usually above the sdw transition temperature @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "in addition , large imbalance of @xmath19- and @xmath20-orbitals at the fermi level and reconstruction of the fermi surfaces ( fss ) had been observed by angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) measurements @xcite .",
    "these results indicate that the ferro orbital - density - wave ( odw ) is the origin of the orthorhombic structure transition .",
    "the sdw state may originate from the in - plane anisotropy in the exchange interaction ( @xmath21 ) associated with the odw order @xcite .",
    "in addition , prominent symmetry breaking @xmath22 is realized in detwinned 122 systems even above @xmath23 and @xmath18 , under very small uniaxial pressure .",
    "for example , it is recognized as the large in - plane anisotropy in the resistivity @xcite and the optical conductivity @xcite at @xmath24k , which is much higher than @xmath23 and @xmath18 . moreover , the reconstruction of the fss starts at @xmath25 in detwinned ba(fe@xmath26co@xmath27)@xmath28as@xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the discovery of these `` electronic nematic phase '' would indicate that the the odw fluctuations deveolop divergently above @xmath23 , and the structure transition is ( almost ) the second - order .",
    "recently , prominent softening of shear modulus in undoped and under - doped ba(fe@xmath26co@xmath27)@xmath28as@xmath28 had been reported by acoustic measurements @xcite .",
    "_ @xcite observed all shear moduli @xmath29 , @xmath6 and @xmath30 .",
    "recently , they had also performed systematic measurement for @xmath31 , and found that only @xmath6 shows the prominent softening in both under- and over - doped systems @xcite .",
    "similar results were reported by goto _",
    "et al . _ independently @xcite .",
    "this observation can be explained by the development of ferro - orbital fluctuations @xcite or spin - nematic fluctuations @xcite . considering large quadrupole - strain coupling in iron pnictides , all the observations mentioned above",
    "suggest the importance of orbital physics , and pose a serious challenge for theories of iron pnictide superconductors .",
    "in fact , goto _ et al . _ have shown that @xmath6 is almost independent of the magnetic field up to @xmath32 t , indicating the non - magnetic origin of the softening @xcite .",
    "thus , the main features of the iron - pnictide superconductors would be summarized as ( i ) the orthorhombic ( or nematic ) transition accompanied by remarkable @xmath6 softening , ( ii ) emergence of high-@xmath0 superconductivity next to the orthorhombic phase , and ( iii ) the stripe - type magnetic order induced by the orthorhombicity .",
    "the unified explanation has not been achieved as far as we know .    in this paper",
    ", we develop the orbital fluctuation theory to explain abovementioned features ( i)-(iii ) based on the random - phase - approximation ( rpa ) and beyond rpa . in the rpa ,",
    "large @xmath2-antiferro - quadrupole ( afq ) fluctuations are produced by the @xmath8-ph interactions , while they do not produce the softening of @xmath6 nor @xmath29 .",
    "if we go beyond the rpa , however , we find that the @xmath5-ferro - quadrupole ( fq ) fluctuations are brought by the `` two - orbiton process '' near the afq quantum - critical - point ( qcp ) .",
    "the induced fq fluctuations cause the softening of @xmath6 , and the commensurate ferro - orbital order is realized at @xmath33 .",
    "it is predicted that the afq - qcp is located at the fq - qcp , which is the endpoint of the orthorhombic phase . near this multi - orbital qcps ,",
    "the superconductivity is mainly caused by the afq fluctuations , and the orthorhombic transition is brought by the fq fluctuations .",
    "moreover , the stripe - type antiferro - magnetic state is induced in the orbital - ordered state , since the orbital polarization gives strong in - plane anisotropy in the spin - nesting .",
    "the present study gives a microscopic justification for the anisotropic heisenberg model description in the sdw state @xcite .",
    "there is a long history in the study of superconductivity due to charge or orbital fluctuations in multiorbital systems , starting from the exciton - assisted superconductivity @xcite . in multiorbital systems",
    ", on - site coulomb interaction is composed of the intra - orbital term @xmath34 , inter - orbital one @xmath35 , and hund s or exchange term @xmath36 .",
    "since @xmath34 is usually larger than @xmath37 , spin fluctuations induced by @xmath34 give non @xmath3-wave sc states .",
    "however , takimoto _ et al _ @xcite had shown that charge ( or orbital ) fluctuations induced by @xmath35 give conventional @xmath3-wave sc state if the relations @xmath38 and @xmath39 are assumed .",
    "although this idea was applied to pnictides @xcite , the relation @xmath40 is realized in many compounds @xcite . even if @xmath40 and @xmath41 , the present authors had shown that the orbital - fluctuation - mediated superconductivity is realized by quadrupole - quadrupole interaction mediated by non-@xmath9 phonons , which works as the `` negative effective exchange @xmath42 for the charge sector . ''",
    "@xcite . in iron pnictides ,",
    "orbital fluctuations develop even when the dimensionless @xmath8-ph coupling @xmath43 due to fe - ion optical phonons is just @xmath44 , according to the rpa @xcite and flex approximation @xcite .",
    "as for as - ion @xmath9 mode @xcite , orbital fluctuations develop only when @xmath45 , which is unrealistic in iron pnictides .",
    "recently , yanagi _",
    "et al_. @xcite added the `` orthorhombic phonon '' to the hh model proposed by the present authors @xcite , and studied the ferro - orbital fluctuations .",
    "however , neither high-@xmath0 nor structure transition are explained by their theory : first , the `` orthorhombic - phonon '' is acoustic ( @xmath46 ) although it is treated as optical in ref . incorrectly",
    "their theory belongs to the cooperative jahn - teller structure transition due to acoustic phonons like manganites ; see details in appendix [ sec : apb ] .",
    "in this case , the energy - scale of `` ferro - orbital fluctuations '' is too low ( @xmath47 ) to explain high-@xmath0 , since experimental @xmath0 is much higher than @xmath48k for @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "small orthorhombicity @xmath50 in iron pnictides is also inconsistent with the cooperative jahn - teller scenerio .",
    "second , the derived orbital order is `` incommensurate '' @xcite , which is inconsistent with the orthorhombic structure transition and the @xmath6 softening .",
    "these problems are resolved in the present theory since both high - energy afq and low - energy `` commensurate '' fq fluctuations develop at the same time , without the necessity of fine - tuning model parameters .",
    "the former ( latter ) fluctuations give the superconductivity ( orthorhombic transition ) .",
    "first , we shortly explain the relation between five - orbital and ten - orbital models for iron pnictides . in this study",
    ", we set @xmath51 and @xmath52 axes parallel to the nearest fe - fe bonds , and represent the @xmath11 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 @xmath55-orbitals in the @xmath56-coordinate as 1,2,3,4 , and 5 , respectively .",

    "since each fe - ion contains five - orbitals , the original tight - binding model for iron - pnictides is given as the `` ten - orbital model '' .",

    "<S> the main features in iron - pnictide superconductors are summarized as ( i ) the orthorhombic transition accompanied by remarkable softening of shear modulus , ( ii ) high-@xmath0 superconductivity close to the orthorhombic phase , and ( iii ) stripe - type magnetic order induced by orthorhombicity . to present a unified explanation for them , </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the multiorbital hubbard - holstein model with fe - ion optical phonons based on the orbital fluctuation theory . in the random - phase - approximation ( rpa ) , a small electron - phonon coupling constant ( @xmath1 ) is enough to produce large orbital ( = charge quadrupole ) fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the most divergent susceptibility is the @xmath2-antiferro - quadrupole ( afq ) susceptibility , which causes the @xmath3-wave superconductivity without sign reversal ( @xmath4-wave state ) . at the same time , divergent development of @xmath5-ferro - quadrupole ( fq ) susceptibility is brought by the `` two - orbiton process '' with respect to the afq fluctuations , which is absent in the rpa . </S>",
    "<S> the derived fq fluctuations cause the softening of @xmath6 shear modulus , and its long - range - order not only triggers the orthorhombic structure transition , but also induces the instability of stripe - type antiferro - magnetic state . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the condensation of composite bosons made of two orbitons gives rise to the fq order and structure transition . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretically predicted multi - orbital - criticality presents a unified explanation for abovementioned features of iron pnictide superconductors . </S>"
