    "this talk considers the question : _ what is the determinant of a partial differential operator , and how might one compute it ? _",
    "the physical motivation for this question comes from several areas of physics :    * effective actions , grand canonical potentials : these appear in relativistic and non - relativistic many - body theory and quantum field theory ( qft ) , and are generically given by an expression of the form @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a green s function , and the trace is over an infinite set of quantum states . *",
    "tunneling and semiclassical physics : tunneling and nucleation processes can be analyzed in a semiclassical approach , wherein the leading exponential contribution involves the action evaluated on a classical solution , while the next - to - leading prefactor is the determinant of the fluctuation operator describing quantum fluctuations about the classical solution : e^-s [ ] * gap equations : in many - body theory and relativistic qft , one can find ground states by solving self - consistent hartree - fock or schwinger - dyson equations , varying the grand canonical potential or effective action with respect to a condensate field .",
    "symbolically , the problem is of the form ( x)=where @xmath2 is some differential operator .",
    "clearly , to be able to vary the determinant efficiently , one needs a clever way to evaluate the determinant . *",
    "lattice gauge theory : integrating out quarks leads to fermion determinant factors d| e^-d^4x| = ( d-8pt / -m ) which are needed for dynamical fermion computations in qcd .",
    "there are still fundamental challenges in evaluating such determinants within the monte carlo approach to lattice gauge theory , especially at finite density and temperature . * faddeev - popov determinants : the determinant of the faddeev - popov operator plays an important role in gauge fixing and confinement . * mathematical physics : the determinant of a partial differential operator , such as a dirac or klein - gordon operator , encodes interesting spectral information .",
    "exact results for functional determinants exist only for certain special cases . for example",
    ", the gauge theory effective action [ the logarithm of the determinant of a dirac or klein - gordon operator ] for background fields with ( covariantly ) constant field strength can be expressed as simple proper - time integrals , building on the seminal work of heisenberg and euler @xcite .",
    "mathematically , these expressions are closely related to the multiple zeta and gamma functions @xcite .",
    "this constant curvature case is soluble because we can choose a fock - schwinger gauge with @xmath3 , in which case the spectral problem decomposes into a set of harmonic oscillator problems , for which the spectral information is very simple .",
    "similarly , in gravitational problems , for special spaces such as harmonic spaces or symmetric spaces , the spectral problem is sufficiently separable and simple that the determinant can be evaluated @xcite .",
    "for example , the determinant of dirac or klein - gordon operators on spheres , cones and tori are known in quite explicit form @xcite .",
    "remarkably , this type of analysis can also be extended to general riemann surfaces @xcite , with important applications to worldsheet problems in string theory and with beautiful applications in number theory and differential geometry .",
    "things become more interesting when including general non - constant curvatures [ either gauge or gravitational ] .",
    "then there are a few especially symmetric cases that are still soluble , but they are all one - dimensional .",
    "for example , in gauge theory , if the field strength points in a particular fixed direction , and has a magnitude that is a function of only one coordinate [ say @xmath4 , and is of the form @xmath5 , then the corresponding [ dirac or klein - gordon ] spectral problem is hypergeometric , and the determinant can be computed explicitly .",
    "also , for massless quarks in an instanton background , the fermion determinant is known .",
    "such a computation was pioneered by t hooft for the single @xmath6 instanton @xcite , but has since been generalized to instantons of full adhm form @xcite , to finite temperature @xcite , and to calorons with nontrivial holonomy @xcite .",
    "these computations all rely on the fact that the green s functions for massless particles in an instanton background are known explicitly .",
    "the generalization to nonzero masses is nontrivial , and is discussed below in section [ idet - sec ] .",
    "some general bounds are known , based on lattice regularizations and generalizations of kato s inequality for dirac and klein - gordon operators .",
    "for example @xcite , | | 1 ; | | 1 . while very general , these bounds are still quite weak , and do not contain information about the phase of the determinant , which can be physically significant .",
    "tighter bounds have been found recently in qed @xcite , but general results are still relatively limited .    for schrdinger operators with general potentials , or dirac / klein - gordon operators with arbitrary gauge and/or gravitational backgrounds , we rely heavily on approximate methods .",
    "one such approximation is the heavy mass expansion .",
    "define = = -_0^ e^-m^2 s \\{e^-s d } then an inverse mass expansion follows ( after renormalization ) from the small @xmath7 asymptotic expansion of the heat kernel operator @xcite \\{e^-s d } ~ _ k=0^s^k a_k . here",
    "the @xmath8 $ ] are known functionals of the potentials appearing in @xmath2 .",
    "similarly , a derivative expansion can be derived by expanding the heat kernel trace @xmath9 about the soluble constant background case , in powers of derivatives of the background .",
    "this corresponds to resumming all non - derivative terms in the inverse mass expansion .",
    "while very general , these expansions are asymptotic , with higher terms becoming rapidly unwieldy , and so have a somewhat limited range of application .",
    "another approach is to define the functional determinant via a zeta function ( s ) _ , where the sum is over the spectrum of the relevant differential operator .",
    "then , by the formal manipulations @xmath10 , one _ defines _ the determinant as = e^-^(0 ) .",
    "the problem becomes one of analytically continuing @xmath11 from the region in which it converges [ typically @xmath12 to the neighbourhood of @xmath13 .",
    "for example , in a radially separable problem , one might estimate the spectrum using wkb phase shifts [ and the corresponding spectral function @xmath14 , thereby obtaining information about the zeta function .",
    "the zeta function approach is complementary to the so - called _ replica method _",
    ", where one defines the logarithm of an operator by considering _",
    "positive _ integer powers @xmath15 of the operator , and then analytically continues to @xmath16 .",
    "there are also non - trivial interesting one dimensional quantum mechanical problems for which the determinant can be computed from the zeta function @xcite .",
    "there are several special features of one - dimensional problems that deserve mention .",
    "first , the issue of renormalization does not really enter in 1d .",
    "second , the theory of inverse scattering allows us to characterize a potential in terms of the associated scattering data .",
    "this is especially useful for solving variational and gap equations , as the variational problem can then be reformulated in terms of the scattering data , which is more direct .",
    "beautiful applications of this idea occur in interacting 1 + 1 dimensional qft s such as the gross - neveu model , sine - gordon model and their generalizations @xcite .",
    "[ inverse scattering has been generalized in higher dimensions for radial problems @xcite ] .",
    "a third special feature of 1d problems is the gelfand yaglom theorem @xcite , which provides a way to compute the determinant of an ordinary differential operator without computing its eigenvalues .",
    "the basic idea is that in 1d one can define the green s function without using an eigenfunction expansion , simply from the product of two independent solutions .",
    "the simplest form of this result can be stated as follows @xcite .",
    "consider a schrdinger operator on the interval @xmath17 $ ] , with dirichlet boundary conditions : ( x)= ( x ) ; ( 0)=(l)=0 then to compute the determinant it is in fact not necessary to compute the infinite discrete set of eigenvalues @xmath18 . instead ,",
    "solve the related _ initial value problem _",
    "( x)=0 ; ( 0)=0 ; ^(0)=1 [ ivp ] then = ( l ) .",
    "[ gy1 ] it is worth pausing to appreciate the simplicity of this result , as well as its practical utility .",
    "it is straightforward to implement numerically .",
    "the determinant follows , without having to compute any eigenvalues , let alone multiply them all together !    actually , ( [ gy1 ] ) is not quite right , as we can only define the _ ratio _ of two determinants @xcite , and ( [ gy1 ] ) should be understood in this sense . often in physical applications",
    "one is computing the determinant _ relative to _ the corresponding determinant for the free operator , for which the initial value problem is usually known in closed form [ in this case it is numerically better to solve directly the initial value problem for the _ ratio _ ] . as an illustration ,",
    "consider the following simple example of the massive helmholtz operator @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "the dirichlet spectrum is @xmath20 , so from the eigenvalues : -1 cm = _",
    "n=1^= _ n=1^= [ 1dh-1 ] on the other hand , if we use the gelfand - yaglom result , we solve the initial value problems : @xmath19\\phi=0 $ ] , to find @xmath21 ; and @xmath22 , to find @xmath23 for the massless operator .",
    "then ( [ gy1 ] ) implies -1 cm = = [ 1dh-2 ] these clearly agree , but the point is that if @xmath24 were replaced by a nontrivial potential @xmath25 , the first approach , from the eigenvalues , would be extremely difficult , while the gelfand - yaglom approach is still easy . as another example , consider the pschl - teller system with @xmath26 $ ] , with integer @xmath27 .",
    "this is a reflectionless potential with @xmath27 bound states at @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) , and phase shift @xmath30 .",
    "the determinant follows directly from the spectrum as -2 cm ( ) & = & _ l=1^j(m^2-l^2)+_0^(m^2+k^2 ) + & = & on the other hand , the solutions to the gelfand - yaglom initial value problems ( [ ivp ] ) are -2 cm ( x)&= & ( p_j^m(-th l ) q_j^m(th x)- q_j^m(-th",

    "( j=0)(x)&=&((m l ) ( m x)+ ( m l ) ( m x ) ) on the interval @xmath31 $ ] .",
    "the @xmath32 and @xmath33 are legendre functions",
    ". then -2 cm = _",
    "l = similarly , one can define a general reflectionless potential with @xmath34 bound states at @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) , by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the @xmath39 matrix @xmath40 .",
    "the @xmath41 are ( constant ) moduli which affect the shape of the potential , but not the spectrum . from the phase shift @xmath42",
    ", one finds the determinant = it is instructive to verify this numerically for various potentials using ( [ ivp ] ) and ( [ gy1 ] ) .    the basic result ( [ gy1 ] ) generalizes in several ways .",
    "first , it generalizes to other boundary conditions @xcite , characterized by two @xmath43 matrices @xmath44 and @xmath34 as m()+n ( ) = 0 construct two independent solutions @xmath45 of @xmath46\\phi(x)=0 $ ] such that u_(1)(0)=1 & ; & u^_(1)(0)=0 + u_(2)(0)=0 & ; & u^_(2)(0)=1 then the infinite dimensional determinant reduces to a simple @xmath43 determinant = _ 22for example , -1 cm dirichlet : m= ( ) , n= ( ) & & = u_(2)(l ) + -1 cm neumann : m= ( ) , n= ( ) & & = u_(1)^(l ) + -1cmperiodic(p ) : m=*1 * , n=-*1 * & & = 2-(u_(1)(l)+u^_(2)(l ) ) + -1cmantiperiodic ( ap ) : m=*1 * , n=*1 * & & = 2+(u_(1)(l)+u^_(2)(l))in the p / ap cases we recognize @xmath47 as the floquet - bloch _ discriminant _ , which takes values @xmath48 for p / ap eigenfunctions .",
    "second , these results generalize straightforwardly to coupled systems of ode s @xcite , and also to linear ode s of any order @xcite .",
    "third , they generalize to sturm - liouville problems @xcite . for example , consider the radial operator in @xmath49 dim . , with dirichlet b.c.s _ ( l)-++v(r ) . [ radial - op ] define the function @xmath50 as the solution to the radial initial value problem _",
    "( l ) ( r ) = 0 ; _ ( l)(r)~r^l+(d-1)/2 , r0 .",
    "[ phi - l ] then ( this should also be understood as applying to _ ratios _ of determinants ) = _ ( l)(r ) .",
    "[ gyr ] as an explicit example , consider the 2d radial helmholtz problem , with eigenvalues in terms of the zeros @xmath51 of the @xmath52 bessel function : @xmath53 .",
    "then -1 cm = _",
    "n=1^ = _ n=1^[radial - eig ] on the other hand , if we use the gelfand - yaglom result ( [ gyr ] ) , we readily solve the relevant initial value problems to find @xmath54 in terms of the modified bessel function @xmath55 : = .",
    "[ radial - bessel ] the agreement between ( [ radial - eig ] ) and ( [ radial - bessel ] ) expresses the product formula for @xmath56 .",
    "in generalizing from _ ordinary _ to _ partial _ differential operators , it is natural to consider first the case of _ separable _ operators .",
    "but the nave extension fails .",
    "formally , we simply take a product over the radial determinants [ each of which is evaluated as above ] for all possible angular momenta , with the appropriate degeneracies .",
    "however , this product diverges @xcite .",
    "for example , for the 2d radial helmholtz system ( [ radial - bessel ] ) ( ) =( ) ~o ( ) , lthe degeneracy factor is @xmath57 for @xmath58 , and @xmath59 for all @xmath60 , so the angular momentum sum over @xmath61 diverges .",

    "figure [ fig4 ] shows these results for @xmath132 , compared with the analytic small and large mass expansions in ( [ masslimit ] ) .",
    "the agreement is remarkable @xcite .",
    "it is a highly nontrivial check on the wkb computation that the correct mass dependence rises to interpolate between the large mass and small mass regimes .     from ( ) , compared with the analytic extreme small and large mass limits [ dashed curves ] from ( ) .",
    "the dots denote numerical data points from ( ) , and the solid line is a fit through these points .",
    "[ fig4 ] ]    as an interesting _ analytic _ check , the formula ( [ answer2 ] ) also provides a simple computation @xcite of t hooft s leading small mass result @xmath147 .",
    "in this talk i have reviewed some of the reasons for considering determinants of partial differential operators in quantum field theory .",
    "mathematically , much is known for _ ordinary _ differential operators , especially through the work of gelfand - yaglom @xcite and its extensions @xcite , but considerably less is known for _ partial _ differential operators with non - trivial potentials .",
    "the new mathematical results @xcite reported here are the formulas in ( [ 4d - result ] ) , which provide simple expressions for the determinant of a radially separable partial differential operator of the form @xmath148 .",
    "this generalizes the ( dirichlet ) gelfand - yaglom result ( [ gy1 ] ) to higher dimensions .",
    "these results lead to many direct applications in quantum field theory , where they extend the class of solvable fluctuation determinant problems away from the restrictive class of constant background fields , or one dimensional background fields , to the more general class of separable higher dimensional background fields .",
    "this includes , for example , applications in quantum field theory to the study of quantum fluctuations in the presence of vortices , monopoles , sphalerons , instantons , domain walls ( branes ) , etc ...    a number of further generalizations could be made .",
    "first , it is practically important to include _ directly _ the matrix structure that arises from dirac - like differential operators and from non - abelian gauge degrees of freedom .",
    "this has been done in various ways for certain applications @xcite , but a simpler unified formalism along the lines of the explicit formulas ( [ 4d - result ] ) is probably possible , as in one dimension @xcite .",
    "second , a practical extension to finite temperature and density would be useful in various physical applications .",
    "third , the biggest technical challenge is to ask if the restriction of separability can be relaxed .",
    "a promising current approach is the numerical worldline loop method @xcite . without symmetry ,",
    "computing functional determinants analytically remains a difficult problem , and any progress will be interesting .",
