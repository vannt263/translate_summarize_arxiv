    "the mass of the top quark is one of the fundamental parameters of the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics .",
    "it plays a key role among the input parameters in the global sm fit of electroweak precision data through its large contribution to radiative corrections  @xcite .",
    "in addition , predictions of models beyond the sm often depend strongly on the value of the top quark mass , e.g. the higgs boson mass in the minimal supersymmetric sm  @xcite . for these reasons , knowing a precise value of the top quark mass is crucial for tests of the sm and models of new physics .",
    "furthermore , the study of the vacuum stability below the planck scale within the sm also requires an accurate value of the top quark mass .",
    "the currently measured values of the masses of the top quark and higgs boson suggest that the sm vacuum lies close to the border between the stable and meta - stable regions , and the dominant uncertainty in this evaluation comes from the uncertainty of the top quark mass  @xcite .",
    "the recent result for the top quark mass obtained by combining direct measurements performed at the tevatron and large hadron collider ( lhc ) yields @xmath5gev  @xcite .",
    "these measurements are achieved by using momenta of the top quark decay products including jet momenta and comparing data with monte carlo ( mc ) simulations . however , since hadronization processes can not be treated within perturbative qcd , jet momenta depend on modeling of hadronization processes in the mc simulation . as a result ,",
    "the top quark mass obtained by such methods is hadronization - model dependent  @xcite and not identical to the pole mass .",
    "it is even difficult to establish the relation between the obtained mass and the pole mass  @xcite .",
    "theoretically preferable quark mass definitions are the so - called short - distance masses , in which only short - distance contributions to the self - energy of a quark are renormalized .",
    "a most commonly used one is the mass in the modified - minimal subtraction scheme ( @xmath6 mass ) , and it is known to exhibit good convergence properties in various perturbative qcd predictions .",
    "so far , the @xmath6 mass of the top quark has been measured from the @xmath0 production cross section as @xmath7gev at the tevatron  @xcite using the theoretical calculation of the cross section in ref .",
    "the errors are still large compared to those of the direct measurements mentioned above .",
    "the theoretical errors of the predicted cross section include uncertainties of the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , and it would be difficult to reduce these uncertainties significantly in near future .",
    "the pdf uncertainties would limit achievable precision of the @xmath6 mass to the order of @xmath8-@xmath9gev in this method  @xcite .",
    "several other methods for measuring the top quark mass at hadron colliders have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "although these methods complement the conventional direct measurements with different systematic uncertainties , most of them are subject to ambiguities of hadronization models . ref .",
    "@xcite uses the normalized differential distribution of the @xmath10-jet cross section with respect to the invariant mass of the final state , which has an advantage that ambiguities of hadronization models induce only indirect effects . in this paper",
    ", we propose a new method for a precise measurement of the top quark mass at the lhc .",
    "the method can determine a theoretically well - defined top quark mass .",
    "it is based on the `` weight function method , '' which we proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . as proven in ref .",
    "@xcite , using the normalized energy distribution @xmath11 of a lepton @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) emitted from the parent particle in the laboratory frame , there exist an infinite number of weight functions @xmath14 with the following property : the weighted integral , @xmath15 vanishes when @xmath16 coincides with the true mass of the parent particle , i.e. @xmath17 .",
    "this property holds irrespective of the velocity distribution of the parent particle .",
    "the weight functions are constructed with the prediction of the lepton energy distribution in the rest frame of the parent particle , which can be calculated in perturbative qcd .",
    "this method can be used if the parent particle is scalar or unpolarized with respect to the direction of the parent particle boost .",
    "the sm prediction for the longitudinal polarization of the top quark in @xmath0 pair production at the lhc is @xmath18 , generated by the weak interaction  @xcite .",
    "since this value is fairly small , our method is applicable ( by including small corrections if necessary ) to the measurement of the top quark mass , using the lepton in the semileptonic decay of the top quark : @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore , since we use only the lepton energy distribution as an observable , this method is ( in principle ) independent of hadronization models in mc simulations .",
    "thus , we can make a direct comparison of the perturbative qcd prediction and experimental data , which enables us to determine the @xmath6 mass of the top quark .    in the above weight function method , we assume an ideal limit where the narrow - width approximation of the top quark is valid and effects of detector acceptance , event selection cuts and background contributions can be neglected .",
    "there are deviations from the ideal limit , however . in this first study",
    ", we concentrate on the deviations due to experimental aspects , which should be formidable obstacles to achieve an accurate measurement of the top quark mass at hadron colliders .",
    "we perform a simulation analysis of the top quark mass measurement with the weight function method at the leading order ( lo ) , taking account of effects of detector acceptance , event selection cuts and background contributions .",
    "we study top quarks in @xmath0 production which decay into lepton+jets final states at the lhc .",
    "we show that major experimental problems are estimated to be sufficiently tamed , and therefore , this method can be useful for a precise top quark mass determination .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "setup ] , we explain the setup and basics of our analysis . in section  [ sec :",

    "we show the results of top mass reconstruction in section  [ sec : results ] .",

    "we consider for the signal process , @xmath0 productions and their subsequent decays into a muon plus jets at the lhc : @xmath20 for the background events , other @xmath0 , @xmath21jets , @xmath22jets and single - top processes are considered .",
    "other @xmath0 events include all the decay channels of @xmath0 except the above signal decay channel .",
    "in particular , the other lepton+jets channel @xmath23jets , as well as the @xmath24jets final state , where @xmath25 is produced in tau lepton decays , are regarded as background events .",
    "the @xmath21jets and @xmath22jets events are generated by using the matrix elements of @xmath26-jets and @xmath27-jets processes merged with parton - shower , respectively .",
    "the single - top background includes contributions from the @xmath28-channel , @xmath29-channel and @xmath30 associated production processes .",
    "both signal and background events are generated at lo using madgraph / madevents  @xcite with @xmath4tev , and they are passed to pythia  @xcite subsequently .",

    "we can choose an arbitrary odd function of @xmath34 in the bracket of the integrand .",
    "at lo , @xmath33 is given by @xmath35 with @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 represent the masses of the bottom quark , @xmath40 boson , and the width of the @xmath40 boson , respectively .",
    "we choose for the odd function of @xmath34 in eq .",

    "[ fig : weightfunc ] shows the weight functions used in the following analysis obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : weightfunc])-([eq : oddfunc ] ) with @xmath44gev .",
    "because of their small weights around @xmath45 , where effects of the lepton cuts are large ( see next section ) , we can expect that these weight functions are less sensitive to the cuts , compared to weight functions which have non - zero values around @xmath45 .",

    "the shift @xmath49gev due to the effect of the top width is a systematic bias to be corrected . ]",
    "therefore , we confirm that our method works within the mc statistical errors .",
    "defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : weightedintegral ] ) with the parton - level lepton distribution and the weight functions corresponding to @xmath42 and @xmath43 . the input value of the top quark mass is @xmath47gev .",
    "[ fig : imparton ] , width=226 ]",
    "in this section we examine effects of various event selection cuts .",
    "we make several assumptions and take specific analysis methods . some of these assumptions and analysis methods need to be examined carefully , since they can be sources of systematic uncertainties .",
    "we provide further discussion on these points in section  [ sec : discussion ] .    in real experiments , detector effects , event selection cuts and backgrounds",
    "deform the lepton energy distribution .",
    "the major effect is caused by the lepton cuts : @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the transverse momentum and pseudo - rapidity of a muon , respectively .",
    "for the values of the above @xmath53 and @xmath54 cuts , we refer to the lhc @xmath55 trigger  @xcite and the pgs default value of @xmath56 cut .",
    "the lepton cuts reduce mainly the low - energy part of the lepton distribution .",
    "this results in large shifts of the weighted integrals @xmath46 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : imaftlepcuts ] . because the weight functions are negative for small @xmath57 , where the lepton distribution is largely reduced , the weighted integrals shift in the positive direction .",
    "the zeros of @xmath46 are significantly displaced from the input top mass due to these shifts .     with the mc events after the lepton cuts for the weight functions corresponding to @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the input value of the top quark mass is @xmath47gev .",
    "[ fig : imaftlepcuts ] , width=226 ]    we solve this problem by compensating for the loss caused by the lepton cuts , using mc events which satisfy @xmath58gev or @xmath59 .",
    "this is because ( 1 ) experimental effects are well understood concerning leptons , so that the estimates of mc simulations are accurate for the lepton distribution , and ( 2 ) the weight function method utilizes the fact that the angular distribution of the lepton in the rest frame of the top quark is flat .",
    "distribution is ( almost ) flat , where @xmath60 is measured from the boost direction of the top quark in the rest frame of the top quark .",
    "] when this condition holds , the zero of @xmath46 is independent of the velocity distribution of the top quark , owing to which we do not need information on the velocity distribution .",
    "therefore , in order to make maximum use of the advantages of this method , we recover the flat angular distribution of the lepton and return the zero of @xmath46 to the right place .",
    "the normalization of the compensated events is determined such that the @xmath53 distribution of the data and compensated events are connected smoothly .",
    "we can check validity of the compensated events partly , using the di - leptonic channel , whose lepton @xmath55 cut can be looser than the lepton@xmath61jets channel .",
    "we evaluate part of uncertainties in the compensated events by varying the factorization scale and pdf in the mc in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "the effects which cause differences between the lepton momenta at the parton level and detector level such as the effects of lepton isolation and photon emissions , also deform the lepton energy distribution .",
    "since these effects are also well understood , it should be possible in principle to estimate them and restore the parton - level lepton distributions .",
    "we assume that the distributions are restored not event by event but for their entire distributions . in this simulation analysis , we suppose for simplicity that they can be estimated and restored completely for signal events and just use the parton - level leptons .",
    "we use the detector - level information of each event for the lepton momenta of the background events and jet momenta .",
    "the criterion for validity of the weight function method is whether we can restore the original shapes of the following two distributions by unfolding detector effects and effects of cuts and backgrounds : the lepton energy and angular distributions in the rest frame of the top quark .",
    "( typical required accuracies are a few percent level . )",
    "cuts concerning missing transverse momentum @xmath62 affect mainly the former distribution through the following reason . in the rest frame of the top quark , the energy of a neutrino is uniquely determined from the energy of its paired lepton neglecting the effects of the @xmath40 off - shellness and at lo . in this frame",
    ", high - energy leptons corresponds to low - energy neutrinos .",
    "this tendency remains after including the effects of boosts with the top quark velocity distribution .",
    "since the angular distribution of the neutrino in the rest frame of the top quark is flat just like the lepton , neutrinos with an energy @xmath63 in the top quark rest frame have a distribution in the laboratory frame with its peak in the same position as the rest frame energy @xmath63 , that is , many neutrinos tend to keep the same energy after the boosts  @xcite .",
    "thus , a high - energy lepton in the top quark rest frame still corresponds to low - energy part of neutrino after the boosts , and for example , dropping events with small @xmath62 corresponds to losing mainly a high - energy part of lepton distribution in the top quark rest frame . for this reason",
    ", tight @xmath62 cuts severely deform the lepton distribution , and thus , we do not apply cuts concerning @xmath62 in this analysis . in order to apply this method in real experiments , @xmath62 cuts",
    "need to be relaxed compared to those used in current major analyses .",
    "we confirmed that loose cuts concerning @xmath62 , for example , @xmath64gev and @xmath65gev , are also applicable keeping the above criterion .    cuts using @xmath66-tagging are highly effective to reduce the @xmath21jets background .",
    "however , @xmath55 and @xmath56 dependence of the @xmath66-tagging efficiency causes a bias to the lepton distribution , especially to the angular distribution .",
    "one way to cope with this effect is using the estimate of the @xmath66-tagging efficiency @xmath67 , and multiplying the lepton energy distribution by @xmath68 .",
    "although this is a simple and realistic way , it is affected by the experimental accuracy of @xmath67 and depends on the details of the actual experimental conditions . in this simulation analysis",
    ", we apply an alternative way which causes nearly equivalent effects but more conservative results .",
    "we apply @xmath66-tagging with an efficiency independent of @xmath55 and @xmath56 to taggable @xmath69gev and @xmath70 @xmath66-jets , adopting the lowest efficiency in the taggable region .",
    "we refer the value of the atlas experiment for the @xmath66-jets taggable region  @xcite .",
    "this flat efficiency would be attainable in experiments in principle .    to simulate the flat @xmath66-tagging efficiency , we assume that the expectation value of the number of @xmath66-jets within the above taggable region is @xmath71 for events with @xmath72 bottom quarks , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the numbers of jets in the taggable region and all region , respectively.-@xmath75% , and as a result",
    ", we underestimate the efficiency .",
    "] we use the following values for the efficiencies in the region @xmath69gev and",
    "@xmath76 , @xmath77 referring to the lowest @xmath66-tagging efficiency in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we choose @xmath66-tagged events randomly according to the probability derived from the above assumption .    considering the effects of cuts",
    "as explained above , we impose the following event selection cuts to the mc events :    * one muon with @xmath78gev and @xmath79 .",

    "* @xmath80gev ,    where @xmath81 is the transverse momentum of the jet with the @xmath82-th largest @xmath55 . here",
    ", we do not regard the hadronically - decaying tau lepton as a jet .",
    "the lo cross sections after all the event selection cuts are summarized in table  [ tab : crosssection ] .",
    "they are evaluated using events at the detector level .",
    ".[tab : crosssection ] cross sections after all the cuts . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "one can see in table  [ tab : uncertainties ] that the uncertainties from the factorization scale dependence dominate .",
    "the jes uncertainties are relatively small , reflecting the characteristics of our method which uses solely the lepton distribution . combining the uncertainties in table  [ tab : uncertainties ]",
    ", the total uncertainty amounts to about @xmath83gev for @xmath84 .",
    "the important point in our method is how accurately the parton - level signal distributions of leptons can be restored from events after all the cuts and with backgrounds . in this context , we discuss validity , other sources of uncertainties and possibilities of improvements of our method .    we have assumed that the effects of lepton isolation and photon emissions can be evaluated and restored completely in this analysis . since the lepton isolation effects on the lepton energy distribution is a function of the isolation cone angle , we expect that experimental data can be extrapolated to the zero cone angle and an estimate can be obtained . on the other hand , we can include the effect of photon emissions in the weight functions by calculating the lepton distribution with the effect .    in order to overcome the problem of the lepton cuts , we compensate for the loss using mc events .",
    "we can also include the effects of lepton isolation in the compensating method in the same way as the effects of the lepton cuts : by compensating for the loss caused by the lepton isolation effects .",
    "the analysis in the previous section shows that @xmath46 does not depend strongly on the top quark mass @xmath85 of the compensated events .",
    "this good feature is partly due to the way of determining the normalization of the compensated events .",
    "our strategy is to smoothly connect the lepton @xmath55 distribution , without detailed knowledge on the global shape of the distribution , which depends on pdfs . owing to this ,",
    "the normalization of the compensated events is subject to that of the data .",
    "if instead we utilize the total cross section to determine the normalization , we do not obtain this good feature of @xmath46 .",
    "quality of the fit to determine the normalization of the compensated events is a crucial factor in our method . in this first analysis",
    "we assumed a rather simple fitting function ( arbitrary quartic polynomial ) and also we did not apply any correction to the @xmath55 distribution shape , after including all the cuts .",
    "because of this simplified analysis , we find that the quality of the present fit is not optimal .",
    "the statistical errors in table  [ tab : uncertainties ] include this effect . in a more elaborate analysis",
    ", we can estimate the ( small ) correction to the @xmath55 distribution caused by the cuts and also improve on the fitting function .",
    "alternatively it may be useful to raise the value of the lepton @xmath55 cut , since the other cuts tend to deform the lepton @xmath55 distribution more at lower @xmath55 .",
    "one may wonder if the same results can be obtained without compensating mc events . in principle",
    "if we fit the lepton distributions to mc predictions using a multi - variate analysis , we would be able to obtain the same result . while this is in principle possible , up to now we have not achieved to develop a pragmatic method , partly due to the complexity of such a method .",
    "even if this is achieved , it would be quite non - trivial to disentangle different sources of systematic uncertainties clearly .",
    "on the other hand , an advantage of our method is that different sources of systematic uncertainties are under relatively good control .",
    "the background estimates can be done either by a side - band method or using mc . in the side - band method",
    ", we should take into account extrapolation errors in addition to the statistical errors . in the case of using mc ,",
    "errors of mc predictions should be considered .",
    "the main background events after the cuts come from @xmath0 events in which @xmath40 bosons decay into @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "since these decays can be predicted accurately , we expect that we can evaluate contributions of background events with a good accuracy .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath86 and @xmath87 decay modes can be included in the signal events in principle .",
    "besides , we can regard the decay process of the top quark where a muon is emitted via @xmath89 decay as a signal process . in this case",
    "we include the contribution of the muon energy distribution of this process in the rest frame of the top quark into the weight functions .",
    "we have made a separate study for the effects of @xmath66-tagging . in section  [ sec :",
    "cuts ] , we have simulated assigning @xmath66-jets randomly from all the jets .",
    "instead we have changed the default @xmath66-tagging efficiency in pgs to the flat @xmath66-tagging efficiency @xmath90 in the region @xmath69gev and @xmath79 .",
    "we have performed the same analysis as in section  [ sec : results ] for the case of the input top quark mass of @xmath47gev and with a ( smaller ) mc event sample of @xmath91 events and compared the two @xmath66-tagging simulations .",
    "we find that the results of the top mass reconstruction are consistent in both simulations of @xmath66-tagging within the mc statistical errors of about @xmath8gev .",
    "nevertheless , effects of @xmath66-tagging would depend crucially on the details of the actual experimental conditions , and their detailed study is requisite . with our estimates ,",
    "the uncertainties associated with the factorization scale dependence in the compensated events are the main source of uncertainties in the lo analysis . by including higher - order corrections into the production process of the top quark",
    ", we expect that these uncertainties would be reduced considerably .",
    "in addition , including higher - order corrections into the decay process of the top quark in the weight functions , and also mc simulation if we compensate events , we can measure the @xmath6 mass of the top quark with this method .",
    "since there are shifts due to the effects of the top quark width with the size of @xmath92-@xmath1gev , it is also important to include the effects of off - shellness of top quarks .",
    "these studies of higher - order corrections and off - shellness of top quarks are beyond the scope of this paper and left as subjects of our future works .",
    "we proposed a new method to measure a theoretically well - defined top quark mass at the lhc , utilizing the  weight function method . \"",
    "this method requires the lepton energy distribution in the laboratory frame as an observable . in an ideal limit , where the narrow - width approximation of the top quark is valid and effects of detector acceptance ,",
    "event selection cuts and background contributions can be neglected , this method has a boost - invariant characteristic concerning the top quark . due to this characteristic , we need only the prediction of the lepton energy distribution in the rest frame of the top quark , which can be calculated in perturbative qcd .",
    "therefore , we can compare the observable with the perturbative qcd prediction irrespective of hadronization models and pdfs .",
    "there are deviations from the above ideal limit . in this paper , we concentrated on deviations due to experimental aspects , that is , the effects of detector acceptance , event selection cuts and background contributions . taking into account these effects",
    ", we performed a mc simulation study using @xmath0 production and lepton+jets decay channel at lo .",
    "we found that although the effects of the lepton cuts are most serious , this difficulty can be overcome by compensating for the loss caused by the cuts using mc events .",
    "we estimated the signal statistical error for the top quark mass to be @xmath1gev corresponding to an integrated luminosity of @xmath2fb@xmath3 at @xmath4tev .",
    "we also estimated uncertainties due to factorization scale dependence and pdf uncertainties in the compensated events , jes dependence and background statistical fluctuation . among these",
    ", the error due to the factorization scale dependence , which amounts to about @xmath93gev , dominates .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that this error is reduced if we include the nlo corrections to the top quark production processes in the mc simulation .",
    "we checked that the uncertainties from jes are suppressed , reflecting the feature of our method using the lepton observable .",
    "thus , our method differs qualitatively from those which use jet momenta as the primary information in the top quark mass determination .",
    "we discussed other sources of systematic uncertainties ( @xmath66-tagging , lepton isolation effects , quality of fits in our method , errors in background estimation , etc . ) in section  [ sec : discussion ] . in conclusion",
    ", we estimate that various systematic uncertainties can be sufficiently tamed in our method .",
    "it is , however , imperative toward a realistic top quark mass determination to incorporate in the analysis the details of the actual experimental conditions at the lhc . in this respect ,",
    "an analysis in collaboration with experimentalists would be desirable in the future .",
    "taking into account theoretical corrections to the ideal limit will be subjects of our future works .",
    "important corrections are the nlo and nnlo corrections to the top quark decay processes in perturbative qcd  @xcite and the effects of the off - shellness of the top quark . as a consequence of the boost - invariant nature ,",
    "this method has the advantage that only the higher - order qcd corrections concerning the decay process of the top quark are primarily required . by including these corrections in weight functions ,",
    "the @xmath6 mass of the top quark can be determined .",
    "since we use mc events in the compensating method which we devised to overcome the problem of the lepton cuts , we should include also in the mc simulation the corrections to the leptonic decay .",
    "we point out that this method can be applied to the di - leptonic channel as well .",
    "although this channel has a smaller cross section than the lepton+jets channel , it is clean and ( in principle ) a lower lepton @xmath55 cut can be applied .",
    "thus , the di - leptonic channel is also worth investigating .    at present a precise measurement of the top quark @xmath6 mass at the lhc",

    "<S> we propose a new method to measure a theoretically well - defined top quark mass at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> this method is based on the  weight function method , \" which we proposed in our preceding paper . </S>",
    "<S> it requires only lepton energy distribution and is basically independent of the production process of the top quark . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a simulation analysis of the top quark mass reconstruction with @xmath0 pair production and lepton+jets decay channel at the leading order . </S>",
    "<S> the estimated statistical error of the top quark mass is about @xmath1gev with an integrated luminosity of @xmath2fb@xmath3 at @xmath4tev . </S>",
    "<S> we also estimate some of the major systematic uncertainties and find that they are under good control . </S>"
