    "observations in the solar neighbourhood have shown a high binary frequency ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; see also the review of @xcite ) .",
    "because the binary frequency in star - forming regions is even higher than that in the field @xcite , a majority of stars is believed to be born as binaries . however , the observable star - forming regions are limited in the solar neighbourhood and thus at metallicity comparable to the solar abundance ( i.e. , @xmath2 ) .",
    "we do not know the binary frequency in lower ( @xmath3 ) or zero ( @xmath4 ) metallicity environments .",
    "binary stars have important roles in many astrophysical contexts .",
    "they are considered to be related to a pollution of extremely metal - poor stars ( suda et al .",
    "2004 ; lucatello et al . 2005",
    "; komiya et al . 2006 ) , progenitors of gamma - ray bursts ( bromm & loeb 2006 ) and type ia supernovae ( nomoto , thielemann , & yokoi 1984 ) , the evolution of globular clusters ( sugimoto & bettwieser 1983 ; makino 1996 ) and the source of gravitational waves ( e.g. , seto 2002 ) .    the formation process of binary ( or multiple ) systems in collapsing clouds with @xmath5 has been studied by means of three - dimensional hydrodynamics ( see the reviews of @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "they showed that fragmentation occurs after the cloud becomes optically thick at @xmath6 , leading to formation of binary or multiple stellar systems .",
    "whether fragmentation occurs depends sensitively on the initial condition , e.g. the initial angular velocity and cloud shapes @xcite . thus , to determine the fragmentation condition and binary frequency , we need to calculate cloud evolution for a number of models .    on the other hand ,",
    "star formation in primordial clouds has also been investigated by cosmological three - dimensional simulations @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite succeeded in calculating cloud evolution up to protostar formation ( @xmath7 ) and demonstrated that fragmentation does not occur .",
    "however , cosmological simulations tend to calculate only a single clump with the lowest angular momentum , which collapses first .",
    "this setting prevents the cloud from fragmenting , because binaries form in clouds with a high angular momentum .",
    "therefore , if we consider not only the clouds collapsing first but also those forming at a later time , binaries may form within them .",
    "in fact , @xcite and @xcite calculated the collapse of primordial clouds with different degrees of initial rotation , and showed the possibility of fragmentation and binary formation .",
    "@xcite demonstrated fragmentation of zero- and low - metallicity turbulent clouds by three - dimensional hydrodynamics and showed that the fragments acquire angular momentum from turbulence .",
    "the cloud evolution and fragmentation condition only for primordial clouds were investigated in @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated the evolution of clouds with various metallicities and showed that the binary frequency increases as the metallicity decreases .",
    "however , in this study , almost spherical clouds are adopted as the initial states . as @xcite pointed out",
    ", slight differences in the initial conditions may affect cloud evolution and its fragmentation process . in the present paper ,",
    "we investigate cloud evolution with various metallicities for a wider range of initial conditions than @xcite .",
    "especially , to investigate the effect of the cloud shape on fragmentation , in some models , we adopt a strongly distorted structure as the initial state . in total",
    ", we have calculated 480 models with combinations of three parameters : the cloud metallicity ( @xmath8 ) , initial rotation energy ( @xmath9 ) , and initial amplitude of the non - axisymmetric perturbation ( @xmath10 ) corresponding to the initial cloud shape . the large number of models makes it possible to discuss the fragmentation condition and epoch , separation between fragments for clouds with different metallicities .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the basics of our model are summarized in  2 .",
    "the thermal evolution of clouds with different metallicities is shown in  3 .",
    "then , we describe the dependence on initial cloud parameters in  4 . in  5 , we discuss some uncertainties and possible fates of the fragments .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in  6 .",
    "we solve the equations of hydrodynamics adopting a nested grid method to ensure the jeans condition of the collapsing cloud .",
    "each level of a rectangular grid has the same number of cells of @xmath11 ( for details , see machida et al .",
    "2005a ; 2006a ) .",
    "the energy equation is not solved : instead , we adopt the barotropic relations for pressure as a function of density calculated with one - zone models by omukai et al .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] shows these relations for different metallicities as a function of the number density . as an initial condition , we take a spherical cloud with density @xmath12 times higher than hydrostatic equilibrium with external pressure ( i.e. the so - called critical bonnor ",
    "ebert sphere ; see @xcite ) .",
    "the initial central density is taken as @xmath13 = @xmath14 .",
    "the critical radius of the bonnor - ebert sphere is @xmath15^{1/2}$ ] . outside this radius , a uniform gas density of @xmath16",
    "is assumed .",
    "each cloud rotates rigidly ( @xmath17 ) around the @xmath18-axis .",
    "the initial temperatures , which are derived from the one - zone model , are different in clouds with different metallicities ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "for example , a cloud with @xmath4 ( primordial composition ) has an initial temperature of 230k , while a cloud with @xmath5 ( solar composition ) has 7k . as critical bonnor ",
    "ebert spheres are assumed as the initial state , the radii of the initial spheres are different among models with different metallicities ( or different initial temperatures ) : the radius for models with @xmath4 is @xmath19au , while that for models with @xmath5 is @xmath20au .",
    "we confirmed that initial differences in radius do not greatly affect subsequent cloud evolution , in which different cloud sizes but the same metallicity are adopted as the initial state .    to induce fragmentation , the non - axisymmetric density perturbation of the @xmath21 mode ( i.e. the bar mode ) @xmath22 is added to the initial cloud : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the amplitude and effective radius of the density perturbation , respectively , and @xmath26 is the cylindrical radius on the equatorial plane .",
    "we adopt @xmath24 as @xmath27 , and @xmath25 as @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "models with @xmath30 have a larger non - axisymmetric perturbation than those with @xmath31 .",
    "the initial cloud has a strongly distorted shape in models with large @xmath10 and @xmath32 . for convenience ,",
    "we describe the amplitude of the non - axisymmetric perturbation as @xmath10 , in which a capital ` l ' is added after the value of the amplitude only when @xmath33 is adopted . for example , the model with @xmath34l has parameters of ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) = ( 0.1 , 0.1@xmath29 ) , while that with @xmath34 has parameters of ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) = ( 0.1 , @xmath29 ) .",
    "the models are characterized by three parameters : the cloud metallicity @xmath8 , initial rotation energy @xmath9 and degree of non - axisymmetric perturbation @xmath10 .",
    "the initial rotation energy means the ratio of rotation to gravitational energy in the initial core .",
    "the values used for these parameters are @xmath8 = @xmath35 , @xmath9 = @xmath36 , and @xmath10 = @xmath37 and @xmath38l@xmath390.4l . combining three parameters ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 )",
    ", we calculated 480 models .",
    "before discussing fragmentation process , we briefly summarize the outline of thermal evolution with different metallicities ( fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) , and see its consequence on dynamical evolution of clouds with very small rotation energy @xmath40 .",
    "for those models , the radial density and velocity profiles are shown in figures  [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] at some different epochs from the initial state ( @xmath41 ) to after the protostar formation ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "the thermal evolution of the clouds with @xmath43 is almost the same as the @xmath4 case . for the clouds with @xmath4 and @xmath43 , the density and velocity distributions are almost the same .",
    "the temperature remains rather high ( @xmath44k at @xmath41 ) and increases gradually with the effective ratio of specific heat @xmath45 .",
    "the density gradient in the outer envelope is well approximated by @xmath46 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "even though the cloud becomes optically thick to the h@xmath47 collision - induced absorption at @xmath48 , effective cooling by the h@xmath47 dissociation prevents the temperature from rising adiabatically until @xmath49 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) , where the dissociation is almost completed .",
    "subsequently , the growing pressure halts the gravitational collapse at the center and the protostar forms , which is surrounded by accretion shock ( @xmath50 at @xmath51 ; fig .  [ fig3 ] ) with a radius and mass of @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively .    with metal enrichment @xmath54 ,",
    "a striking difference emerges in thermal and dynamical evolution .",
    "the clouds becomes optically thick to the dust in a density around @xmath55 , which depends on metallicity in a way that those with lower @xmath8 becomes adiabatic at a higher density , and experience a transient adiabatic phase up to the onset of h@xmath47 dissociation at @xmath56k ( _ first adiabatic phase _",
    ", hereafter ) .",
    "thus , during the first adiabatic phase , a transient hydrostatic core , called _ the first core _ , appears ( indicated by the dotted arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the first core has a size of @xmath57 au , and mass of @xmath58 at its formation .",
    "the central temperature of the first core increases with the mass of the first core , which grows by accretion . at @xmath56k ( @xmath59 ) ,",
    "the h@xmath47 begins to dissociate and another episode of dynamical collapse begins .",
    "this is called the _ second collapse phase _ , in contrast with the _ first collapse phase _ before the first adiabatic phase .",
    "the evolution thereafter coincides with the zero - metallicity case . following the end of dissociation ( @xmath60 ) , the temperature increases adiabatically again ( the _ second adiabatic phase _ ) and a second hydrostatic - core ( the protostar ) forms with a similar size as that in zero - metallicity case .",
    "note that two hydrostatic cores ( the first core and the protostar ) appear in a nested manner , i.e. , the protostar forms inside the first core .",
    "correspondingly , two shocks are seen for @xmath54 in figures  [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] .",
    "this existence of two adiabatic phases , one at @xmath61 and the other @xmath62 , during the collapse has an important consequence in fragmentation nature of metal - enriched clouds .    in the model with @xmath63 , three shocks ( i.e. , three velocity peaks )",
    "appear with an extra weak shock at @xmath64 by the rapid h@xmath47-formation heating at @xmath65 ( see , fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "however , because of the very short duration , no clear adiabatic core is observed at this epoch .",
    "in this section , we see the evolution of clouds with different values of rotation energy @xmath9 and non - axisymmetric perturbation @xmath10 ( i.e. , cloud shape ) at the initial states . for a given metallicity , the number of combination ( @xmath66 ) we calculated amounts to 80 . with eight different metallicities @xmath67 ,",
    "480 models are calculated in total .",
    "the density distributions on the equatorial plane at the end of calculation are presented for different combinations of ( @xmath66 ) , which are indicated by the ordinate and abscissa , in figures  [ fig4 ] - [ fig11 ] for a given metallicity .",
    "the density perturbation is imposed at the scale of the critical radius of the be sphere @xmath29 for models shown in the first - seventh columns , while at @xmath68 for those in the eighth - tenth columns ( indicated by `` l '' ; see ,  [ sec : model ] ) .",
    "the latter corresponds to models of larger non - axisymmetric perturbation ( i.e. more distorted ) .",
    "the white - and - black - dotted lines in figures  [ fig4 ] - [ fig11 ] mark the border between models in which the clouds fragment or not .",
    "each class of models can be classified into two sub - classes , which are indicated by the background colours : the fragmentation models include `` fragmentation '' ( _ red _ ) and `` merger '' ( _ violet _ ) models , while non - fragmentation ones include `` non - fragmentation '' ( _ blue _ ) and `` stable - core '' ( _ grey _ ) models .",
    "fragments survive without merger in `` fragmentation '' models , while they merge to form a single core before the end of calculation in `` merger '' models .",
    "the protostars form without fragmentation in the `` non - fragmentation '' models , while , in the `` stable - core '' models , the first core remains stable for @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the local free - fall timescale at the centre . due to our cpu - time limitation",
    ", we failed to follow further cloud evolution for most `` stable - core '' models .",
    "we expect that the first core collapses eventually to form a protostar after angular momentum transfer in a long - term calculation .",
    "in fact , for some `` stable - core '' models , however , we succeeded in following the second collapse and protostar formation and confirmed no fragmentation .",
    "thus , in this paper , we regard the `` stable - core '' models among the cases of non - fragmentation when we discuss the fragmentation condition .",
    "investigation of figures  [ fig4 ] - [ fig11 ] indicates :    \\(i ) the first parameter to determine whether the a rotating spherical cloud fragments or not is the initial rotation parameter @xmath71 .",
    "although the behavior of the boundary between the two cases is very complicated , the threshold value of @xmath71 for fragmentation increases with metallicity , being @xmath72 for @xmath4 while @xmath73 for @xmath5 . as a result , fragmentation is observed in more models for lower metallicity ; 23/60 models for @xmath5 , while 47/60 models for @xmath4 .",
    "\\(ii ) clouds with large non - axisymmetric perturbations develop spiral patterns , which transfer angular momenta by gravitational torque and effectively reduce the rotation parameters @xmath9 .",
    "for example , upward shift of the fragmentation boundary towards larger @xmath10 is seen in the @xmath74 cases .",
    "similarly , the spirals remove angular momenta from the rotation - supported first cores , which appears for @xmath38 , and @xmath75 ( figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] ) , enabling further collapse to the protostar in large @xmath10 cases . since the non - axisymmetric perturbation can grow until the higher density phase for a cloud with lower metallicity , fragmentation tends to occur through the bar configuration .      as seen in figures",
    "[ fig4 ] - [ fig11 ] , the fragmentation condition depends strongly on the initial rotation rate ( @xmath9 ) but only weakly on the initial cloud shape ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "so far , we used the rotation energy of the whole cloud for easier comparison with observations .",
    "it is , however , known that a more important index for cloud evolution and fragmentation is the angular velocity normalized by the freefall timescale ( hereafter the normalized angular velocity ) , @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the angular velocity and density at the centre of the cloud ( matsumoto & hanawa 2003 , @xcite , @xcite ) . for a uniform sphere with rigid rotation",
    ", the normalized angular velocity is related to the rotation energy as @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the radius and mass of the sphere , respectively . along with the collapse ,",
    "the clouds spin up and @xmath82 increases without significant angular momentum transfer . in the case of the primordial ( @xmath4 ) clouds , machida et al .",
    "( 2008b ) found that if the normalized angular momentum reaches the critical value 0.2 - 0.3 ( the gray zone in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] ) and thus a thin disk forms owing to centrifugal force before the protostar formation , the disk subsequently fragments into binary or multiples . on the other hand ,",
    "if the cloud becomes adiabatic and protostar forms before this condition is met , the cloud recovers a spherical shape and does not fragment thereafter . here",
    "we show that , for higher metallicity , appearance of the first core at lower density put more stringent condition on @xmath82 for fragmentation . figure  [ fig12 ] shows evolution of the normalized angular velocity @xmath82 against the central number density for all cases .",
    "initially , while the centrifugal force is not important , the clouds collapse almost spherically and @xmath83 ( also , @xmath84 ) increases in proportion to @xmath85 ( @xmath86 , respectively ) . in clouds with rapid initial rotation",
    ", @xmath83 reaches the critical value @xmath87 and the clouds fragment after some more contraction . for @xmath88 ,",
    "the critical value must be attained somewhat before the protostar formation ( @xmath89 ) for @xmath88 , as found by machida et al .",
    "( 2008b ) , while for @xmath90 this must be before the first core formation ( indicated by the vertical lines in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] ) .",
    "since the first cores form at lower density than the protostars , the clouds have a shorter density range to amplify @xmath83 in the cases of @xmath90 than the primordial case .",
    "in addition , first core appears earlier for higher metallicity .",
    "therefore , an initial higher rotation is required to cause fragmentation for clouds with higher metallicity .",
    "using the relation @xmath91 for spherical collapse , the condition for the normalized angular momentum is amplified from the initial value @xmath92 at density @xmath93 to the critical value @xmath94 before the density @xmath95 where the gas becomes adiabatic is @xmath96 this can be translated to the condition on initial rotation parameter @xmath97 : @xmath98 where @xmath99 .",
    "the adiabatic density @xmath95 and critical rotation parameter @xmath100 given by the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : frag - cond ] ) are listed in table  [ table : table1 ] for different values of @xmath8 . here ,",
    "we used a conservative value of @xmath101 is adopted . for @xmath54",
    ", @xmath95 is the density where the clouds become optically thick to dust grains and the first cores form . for @xmath102 , where no first adiabatic phase is present , after reaching @xmath103 , the clouds need some more density interval before the protostar for fragmentation and thus @xmath104 is adopted as the critical density ( see machida et al .",
    "these values for @xmath105 are in concordance with the results presented in figures  [ fig4 ] - [ fig11 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig13 ] shows the separations at the fragmentation epoch for all fragmentation models . in each panel ,",
    "the solid line indicates the jeans length , while the dashed vertical line indicates the beginning of the first adiabatic phase .",
    "note that the separations are about 10 - 100 times the jeans length since the radial size of the cloud is 10 - 100 times the jeans scale at fragmentation owing to rotation . with the vertical scale comparable to the jeans length , the height - to - radius ratio is about 1/10 at this epoch .    for @xmath5 , fragmentation events cluster near the upper left corner @xmath106 , i.e. , just after first core formation . for lower metallicity",
    ", this distribution extends toward the lower right because the first core forms later and thus fragmentation occurs at a higher density with narrower separation for lower metallicity . for @xmath107 as well as @xmath108 , one fragmentation event",
    "is observed at very high density @xmath109 while the rest locate in @xmath110 , which are due to the first - core formation . in some models of @xmath111 ,",
    "fragmentation is observed also before the first - core formation .",
    "the abrupt temperature rise at @xmath112 in the @xmath111 clouds ( figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] ) temporarily slows the collapse , enabling fragmentation at such an early phase . without the first - core formation , no clear fragmentation epoch exists for @xmath88 .",
    "fragmentation takes place whenever a disk - like configuration appears due to rotation and distributes in a wide range of @xmath113 ( machida et al .",
    "2008a ) although some events at @xmath114 might be caused by the protostar formation , as in the models with @xmath54 at first - core formation .",
    "figure  [ fig14 ] shows the frequency distribution of furthermost separations between fragments at fragmentation this shows that binaries with higher metallicity have a wider separation . those with @xmath2 have separations @xmath115au@xmath116au , while at @xmath117 , the range is @xmath118au .",
    "the separations are distributed in a wide range of @xmath119au for models with @xmath120 .      in a few cases in figures  [ fig4 ] - [ fig11 ] ,",
    "the clouds fail to fragment even if the condition ( eq .  [ eq : omg - cond ] ) is fulfilled . with moderate non - axisymmetry",
    ", the cloud can avoid fragmentation even if condition ( eq .  [ eq : omg - cond ] ) is fulfilled owing to angular momentum is effectively transferred by the spiral arms .",
    "interestingly , with even larger @xmath10 , the clouds tend to fragment through bar configurations instead of ring configurations realized for fragmentation in small @xmath10 cases .",
    "lower metallicity clouds tend to fragment at higher density .",
    "this allows non - axisymmetric perturbations to grow for a longer time .",
    "thus , fragmentation through the bar is more common for lower metallicity .",
    "for example , for @xmath4 , 33 out of total 47 fragmentations are through the bar mode .",
    "as shown in  [ sec : frag - cond ] , the fragmentation condition is that the initial rotation energy @xmath9 must be larger than the threshold value , which increases with the metallicity .",
    "thus , with lower metallicities , clouds with smaller rotation energy can fragment .",
    "observations in the solar neighbourhood have shown that molecular clouds ( with solar metallicity ) have rotation energies in the range of @xmath121 with an average value of @xmath122 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , we can not observe the initial rotation energies of clouds with lower or zero metallicity .",
    "cosmological simulations have shown that host clouds of star formation have rotation energies of @xmath123 @xcite , which is slightly larger than those in molecular clouds .",
    "thus , we expect a higher binary frequency in a lower - metallicity environment ( or in the early universe ) , roughly assuming that host clouds have almost the same distribution of angular momentum ( or rotation energy ) as observations in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "if the lower limit of the rotation energy is @xmath124 , as in the solar neighbourhood , fragmentation always occurs in clouds with @xmath125 , because their fragmentation condition is @xmath126 ( see , table  1 ) . as a result ,",
    "the binary frequency increases as the metallicity decreases , and most stars are born as binary or multiple systems in low - metallicity environments .    in our calculation , fragments have masses of @xmath127 at fragmentation .",
    "this mass range corresponds to that of brown dwarfs or low - mass stars .",
    "the mass of fragments increases in the subsequent accretion phase .",
    "since the gas supply ( or gas accretion ) stops at ejection , ejected fragments with mass of @xmath128 are expected to evolve to form a brown dwarf or low - mass star .",
    "thus , our result indicates that even in extremely low- or zero - metallicity environments , substellar - mass objects can form . on the other hand ,",
    "fragments remaining in the host cloud are expected to increase their mass by accretion and grow to massive stars ( or massive star binaries ) . as a results ,",
    "we expect that a single massive star ( or a massive binary system ) and multiple low - mass stars can be formed in a single host cloud .",
    "when multiple fragments appear like a star cluster , as shown in the upper left panels of figures  [ fig4 ] - [ fig11 ] , low - metallicity stars are expected to have two peaks at @xmath128 and @xmath129 in mass distribution .",
    "note that if fragments stay in the cloud for a while and are ejected after acquiring some mass , a star with mass @xmath130 can form .",
    "subsolar - mass stars can form even in low- ( or zero- ) metallicity environments by the ejection of fragments . recently , metal - poor stars with @xmath131 are observed @xcite .",
    "forming in the early universe , they should have a mass of @xmath132 .",
    "such low - mass metal - poor stars can form by the fragmentation and ejection mechanism , as described above .",
    "in addition , our result allows even the existence of zero - metallicity stars with sub - stellar mass .",
    "our calculation showed that the binary frequency for zero - metallicity stars is as high as for those with @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "thus , we expect observation of zero - metallicity stars in the future . in addition , as in the cases of ( @xmath10 , @xmath135 ) = ( 0.001 , 0.1 ) in figure  [ fig6 ] , the binary system can be ejected from the host cloud when multiple fragments appear .",
    "@xcite claimed that stars with @xmath136 are in binaries , because their surface abundance ratios are well explained by mass transfer from an ( unobserved ) agb companion .",
    "the ejection mechanism may explain the origin of such low- or even zero - metallicity binaries .    in this study , we followed the evolution of fragments and protostars only in their early phase . to determine the final mass and fate of fragments , calculations in the subsequent accretion phase are required .",
    "in this research , we studied the binary / multiple formation process during the collapse of rotating clouds with various metallicities .",
    "we found the following results :    1 .   a transient hydrostatic core ( `` first core '' ) appears during the prestellar collapse for metallicity @xmath137 at higher density and with smaller size toward lower metallicity . for @xmath102 , a protostar",
    "directly forms without any transient core .",
    "2 .   when rotation reaches a fraction of keplerian value before formation of the adiabatic core ( i.e. , the first core for @xmath137 or the protostar for @xmath138 ) , the cloud develops disk - like structure and subsequently fragments into binary / multiples .",
    "this condition can be translated to the initial rotation parameter @xmath71 exceeding a threshold value @xmath100 .",
    "since lower - metallicity clouds have longer density interval to spin up , i.e. higher density for the adiabatic - core formation , they have smaller threshold value . for example , @xmath139 ( @xmath140 ) for @xmath2 ( @xmath4 , respectively ) .",
    "3 .   with modest non - axisymmetric density perturbation ,",
    "angular momentum transfer by gravitational torque can prevent fragmentation . however , even larger non - axisymmetry causes fragmentation through the bar - mode instability .",
    "4 .   for @xmath54 ,",
    "majority of fragmentation occur just after the first - core formation , while for @xmath141 fragmentation epochs distributes in a wide range of @xmath142 .",
    "clouds with lower metallicity fragments at a higher density with shorter orbital period and their binary separations are narrower .",
    "fragmentation proceeds mainly via the bar configuration in low ( @xmath143 ) metallicity clouds , while via the ring configuration for higher metallicity .",
    "the difference in fragmentation modes may affect the subsequent evolution in the accretion phase .",

    "moreover , we expect the possible discovery of zero - metallicity stars in the milky - way halo . on the other hand ,",
