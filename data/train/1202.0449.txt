    "it is widely known that the friedman - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) uniform geometry provides a very successful description of the universe at large scales ( @xmath10 mpc ) . however , due to the structure formation process , the inhomogeneities present at small and moderate scales influence the trajectories of light beams thereby producing observable phenomena like the ones associated to gravitational lensing .",
    "since lensing effects must cause either brightening or dimming of cosmic sources , a basic consequence of the inhomogeneities is to alter the cosmic distances in comparison to the standard homogeneous description . in other words ,",
    "any cosmic distance calculated along the line of sight ( l.o.s ) of the local observers must be somehow corrected by taking into account the presence of inhomogeneities .    at present , the solution of the problem related to the light propagation in the framework of a late time clumpy universe is far from a consensus @xcite .",
    "one possibility to deal with the inhomogeneities is to consider them in randomly distributed compact clumps with higher density compensated by a lower density of the smoothly distributed matter .",
    "the distance obtained in such an approach is called dyer - roeder distance @xcite , although its necessity was already discussed by zeldovich @xcite and kantowski @xcite .",
    "then we refer to it here as the zeldovich - kantowski - dyer - roeder ( zkdr ) distance ( for an overview on cosmic distances taking into account the presence of inhomogeneities see the paper by kantowski @xcite ) . in this model ,",
    "the effects experienced by the light beam is phenomenologically quantified by the smoothness @xmath0 parameter .",
    "there are two limiting cases , namely : @xmath11 ( filled beam ) , where the flrw uniform distances are fully recovered and @xmath12 ( empty beam ) which represents the limit of a totally clumped universe . therefore , for a partial clumpiness , the smoothness parameter lies on the interval @xmath13 .",
    "notice that in this model only demagnification happens .",
    "this is physically expected by the fact that light travels preferentially in voids , with light in denser environments being absorbed or scattered .",
    "there is a rich literature concerning the zkdr approach and its applications to cosmology .",
    "investigations involving many different physical aspects and phenomenologies were performed , among them : analytical expressions @xcite , critical redshift for the angular diameter distance ( @xmath14 ) @xcite , i.  e. , the redshift where @xmath14 attains its maximum value , time delays @xcite , gravitational lensing @xcite and accelerating universe models driven by particle creation @xcite .",
    "more recently , some quantitative analysis by using ultra - compact radio sources as standard rulers @xcite and type ia supernovae as standard candles @xcite were also performed .    in a previous analysis ,",
    "@xcite applied the zkdr approach for a flat @xmath1cdm model by considering two different samples of sne ia , namely , the astier _",
    "( 2006 ) sample @xcite and the gold sample of riess _",
    "( 2007 ) @xcite . the first sample , composed by low redshifts supernovae , provided no constraints to the smoothness parameter , while the latter , which is composed by higher redshifts supernovae , restricted it over the interval @xmath15 . in principle ,",
    "such a result is strongly suggesting that objects at redshifts higher than those probed by sne ia could constrain the smoothness parameter . since gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) have been detected up to redshifts @xmath16 , they are the natural candidates to test such a conjecture .",
    "so far , grbs are the most luminous explosions observed in the universe .",
    "recent theoretical and observational developments have shown that the presence of afterglows and that their best candidates to progenitors are core - colapse supernovae ( for comprehensive reviews on grb physics see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . still more important ,",
    "the possibility of applying them as standard candles has also been discussed by several authors @xcite .",
    "recently , some studies employing grbs have shown that they may provide a complementary test to constrain cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "indeed , grbs are also very promising tools for cosmology from many different viewpoints . in particular , the association of long grbs with peculiar type ib / c sne or hypernovae , and thus the death of very massive stars , is supported both by theories and observations @xcite .",
    "thus , given their huge luminosity and redshift distribution extending up to at least @xmath17 , grbs may be considered powerful and unique tracers for the evolution of the star formation rate up to the reionization epoch @xcite .    in this paper , by assuming a flat @xmath1cdm model , we derive new constraints to the smoothness parameter @xmath0 and the matter density parameter @xmath18 .",
    "the zkdr inhomogeneous distance approach it will be adopted here , however , different from @xcite , the present statistical analysis it will be based on the 557 sne ia from union2 compilation data @xcite plus 59 hymnium grbs @xcite . as we shall see , the current sne ia and grbs samples separately used do not provide tight constraints to the @xmath0 parameter .",
    "nevertheless , our joint analysis restricts the pair of parameters ( @xmath3 ) on the intervals @xmath19 and @xmath20 within @xmath21% confidence level ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "as an extra bonus , it is also found that the einstein - de sitter model is excluded with high statistical confidence level , and , as such , our analysis provides an interesting cosmological probe for dark energy even in the presence of inhomogeneities .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the basic equations and the distance description by taking into account the inhomogeneities as described by the zkdr equation . in section iii , we determine the constraints on the cosmic parameters from the sne ia and grbs samples either separately and also through a joint analysis involving both samples . finally , we summarize the main conclusions in section iv .    0.1 in",
    "in order to describe the degree of inhomogeneity in the local distribution of matter , we also adopt the phenomenological description based on the so - called smoothness parameter , @xmath0 .",
    "this parameter was originally introduced by dyer & roeder @xcite , when writing a differential equation for the angular diameter distance in locally clumpy cosmological models . to obtain the zkdr equation ,",
    "let us consider the light propagation in the geometric optics approximation @xcite @xmath22 where a prime denotes differentiation with respect to the affine parameter @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the cross - sectional area of the light beam , @xmath25 the ricci tensor , and @xmath26 the photon four - momentum . in this form",
    ", it is implicit that the influence of the weyl tensor ( shear ) can be neglected .",
    "this means that the light rays are propagating far from the mass inhomogeneities so that the large - scale homogeneity implies that their shear contribution are canceled @xcite .",
    "further , the ricci tensor @xmath25 is related to the energy momentum tensor @xmath27 through the einstein field equations : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the scalar curvature , @xmath30 is the metric described by a flrw geometry and @xmath31 is newton s constant ( in our units @xmath32 ) .",
    "the clustering phenomenon is introduced by considering the following energy - momentum tensor ( @xmath1cdm model ) @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the four - velocity of the comoving volume elements , @xmath35 is the matter energy density , @xmath36 , is the vacuum energy density associated to the cosmological constant and @xmath37 is the smoothness parameter introduced by dyer & roeder @xcite .",
    "such a parameter quantifies the portion of matter in clumps ( @xmath38 ) relative to the amount of background matter which is uniformly distributed ( @xmath35 ) . in general ,",
    "due to the structure formation process , it should be dependent on the redshift , as well as , on the direction along the line of sight ( see , for instance , @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "however , in the majority of the works @xmath0 is assumed to be a constant parameter .",
    "now , we assume a flat @xmath1cdm cosmology , as well as the validity of the standard duality relation between the angular diameter and luminosity distances , @xmath39 , sometimes called the etherington principle @xcite .",
    "since the the cross - sectional length @xmath40 is proportional to the angular distance @xmath14 , it is readily seen that eq .",
    "( [ sachs ] ) can be rewritten for the dimensionless luminosity distance ( @xmath41 ) as @xcite :    @xmath42    which satisfies the boundary conditions : @xmath43 this is the the zkdr equation , where @xmath44 , @xmath45 end @xmath46 are functions of the cosmological parameters , expressed in terms of the redshift by :    @xmath47    as remarked before , the @xmath0 parameter appearing in the @xmath46 expression quantifies the clustered fraction of the pressureless matter , and would be a redshift dependent quantity . here",
    "we follow the standard treatment so that @xmath0 is also assumed to be a constant ( see , for instance , @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "we know that the universe is homogeneous only at large scales . then , a more realistic description is to consider that at moderate and small scales matter is clumped , being homogeneous only on average . as light is affected by local quantities , not global , expressions like the distance modulus @xmath48",
    "must be altered when the clumpiness phenomenon is taken into account through zkdr equation .    0.1 in    in fig . 1",
    ", we display the effects of the inhomogeneities in the reduced hubble - sandage diagram for the union2 @xcite and hymnium @xcite samples for some selected values of the smoothness parameter .",
    "the plots correspond to several values of @xmath18 and @xmath0 as indicated in the panels .",
    "the difference between the data and models from an empty universe case prediction is also displayed there .",
    "for the sake of comparison , we also show the einstein - de sitter ( e - ds ) model , i.e. @xmath49 and @xmath11 , as well as the present cosmic concordance ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) .",
    "note that cosmologies with only matter and inhomogeneities can show a behavior resembling to some degree the cosmic concordance model .    in order to constrain the @xmath53 and @xmath0 parameters ,",
    "a @xmath2 minimization will be applied for the sets of sne ia and grb data . following standard lines ,",
    "we maximize the posterior probability @xmath54 where : @xmath55 we adopt a gaussian prior for the nuisance parameter @xmath56 centered at @xmath57 @xmath58 @xcite , which will be marginalized , and @xmath59 is given by @xmath60    in the above expression @xmath61 is the theoretical distance modulus for the set of parameters @xmath62 , @xmath63 is the measured distance modulus and @xmath64 its respective uncertainty . for a joint analysis",
    "we just add the @xmath59 of each sample .",
    "we consider the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath53 restricted on the interval [ 0,1 ] in steps of 0.01 for all numerical computations .",
    "let us now discuss the bounds arising from sne ia observations on the pair of parameters ( @xmath65 ) defining the zkdr luminosity distance .",
    "the union2 compilation data @xcite are the largest sne ia sample and consist of 557 objects , where salt2 light - curve fitter @xcite was used to calibrate the supernovae events .",
    "we have applied a @xmath59 minimization using this sample and the results are displayed in figs .",
    "2a , 2b and 2c .",
    "we see from them that the smoothness @xmath0 parameter is poorly constrained , being restricted on the interval @xmath66 within @xmath5 confidence level .",
    "however , good constraints were obtained for the matter density parameter , which is restricted on the interval @xmath67 .",
    "notice that a universe composed only by inhomogeneously distributed matter ( @xmath68 ) is also strongly disfavored by these data .    at this point , it is convenient to compare the results derived here with a previous analysis performed by santos _",
    "_ @xcite using 182 sne ia from the _ gold _ sample observed by riess _",
    "_ @xcite . within @xmath5 c.l .",
    "the following intervals were achieved : @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "it is interesting that the increasement in the number of supernovae data provides a better constraint to @xmath18 , but a greater range for the smoothness parameter is now allowed",
    ". we can understand this behavior by noting that low redshift data are compatible with a more inhomogeneous set of data .",
    "indeed , this fact is in agreement with the conclusion that the structure formation process leads to a more locally inhomogeneous universe thus , with a greater sample , it is more likely to detect the effects caused by the inhomogeneities .",
    "further , since the smoothness parameter appears only in third order in the @xmath71(z ) expansion @xcite , it is interesting to investigate the parameter space ( @xmath72 ) using higher redshifts data .",
    "this will be examined in the next section .",
    "0.1 in      gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) is now offering a possible route to probe the expansion history of the universe up to redshifts @xmath16 .",
    "however , it is widely known that before using grbs to constrain cosmological models , their correlations must be firstly calibrated . here",
    "we consider a relation between the isotropic - equivalent radiated energy in gamma - rays @xmath73 and the photon energy at which the @xmath74 is brightest @xmath75 , known as the amati relation @xcite .",
    "this relation is a power law : @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the cosmological rest - frame spectral peak energy .",
    "the quantity @xmath78 is defined by :    @xmath79    where @xmath80 is the bolometric fluence of gamma - rays in a given grb and @xmath81 is its luminosity distance .    the general procedure to calibrate the relation for cosmological purposes is to use a low redshift sample , where the distance does not depend on the cosmological parameters .",
    "that is not the case for grbs , since the observed nearby grbs may be intrinsically different as grb 980425 and grb 031203 @xcite .",
    "so , the cosmological parameters one would like to constrain enter in the determination of the parameters of the correlation .",
    "this is called the circularity problem . some attempts to overcome the problem",
    "have been studied in the literature @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we use the method proposed independently by kodama _",
    "_ @xcite and liang _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , which was recently updated by wei @xcite .",
    "the method consists in using sne ia as a distance ladder to calibrate the grbs .",
    "since the distance moduli for the sne ia are known , a cubic interpolation is performed to determine the parameters @xmath82 and @xmath83 in the amati relation for the low redshift grbs ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "then , the distance moduli for the highest grbs are obtained and they can be used as standard candles without the circularity problem . in this connection , it is worth mentioning that the calibration of grbs is still a quite controversial subject .",
    "indeed , even the amati relation has been contested by some authors ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "wei @xcite used the 557 union2 sne ia @xcite to calibrate 109 grbs compiled in @xcite . by applying a cubic interpolation with 50 low redshift grbs ( @xmath84 ) , the parameters of the amati relation were determined and the distance moduli for the other 59 grbs",
    "were derived .",
    "this sample is called the hymnium sample and can be used to derive cosmological parameters without the circularity problem .    in fig .",
    "3 we display the results of our statistical analysis using the grb hymnium sample . from fig .",
    "3a we see that both parameters are poorly constrained by the data .",
    "the likelihoods appearing in figs . 3b and",
    "3c allow us to get the following constraints within @xmath5 : @xmath85 while all values for the smoothness parameter are allowed within @xmath5 .",
    "these data are also compatible with a model composed by inhomogeneously distributed matter ( @xmath86 , @xmath49 ) . in principle , such a fact can be understood by noticing that the considered sample is dominated by data with high redshifts , and , therefore , just in a moment where the dark energy component does not play a prominent role for the cosmic evolution .",
    "naturally , the low restriction over @xmath0 may also reflect the poor quality of the current grb data as seen by the intrinsic scatter in the amati relation . in this concern , although out of the scope of this work , it would be interesting to analyze how different phenomenological relations used to calibrate the grbs can alter the current constraints .",
    "it is widely recognized that joint analyses in cosmology usually provide a powerful tool to improve constraints in the basic cosmological parameters .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to perform a statistical analysis by combining the 557 sne ia from the union2 compilation data @xcite with the 59 hymnium grbs @xcite .    in figs .",
    "4a , 4b and 4c we display the main results of our joint analysis . as can be seen from fig .",
    "4a , the constraints on both parameters are significantly improved .",
    "the best fit obtained is @xmath87 and @xmath52 , with a @xmath88 .",
    "the confidence interval within @xmath5 for the matter density parameter was slightly changed ( @xmath89 ) compared to the sne ia sample while for the smoothness parameter a great improvement was achieved ( @xmath90 ) as compared to the limits individually obtained from each sample .",
    "again , the einstein - de sitter model is excluded with high confidence . the better restriction over @xmath0",
    "can be understood as follows : the high redshift grb data prefer a homogeneous universe , and , as such , it should contribute to diminish the corresponding space parameter ( see fig .",
    "4a ) . in other words , since the high redshift universe is more homogeneous , higher values of @xmath0 are favored , exactly as happened .    in table",
    "i , we have summarized the main results of our joint analysis .    0.1 in    .limits to @xmath0 and @xmath18 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in the era of precision cosmology , it is expected that standard rulers and candles of ever - increasing accuracy will provide powerful constraints on dark energy and other cosmic parameters . however , in order to proceed with such a program it is also necessary to analyze carefully the physical hypotheses underlying the basic probes .",
    "it should also be recalled that even the large scale homogeneity ( copernican principle ) has been challenged in the last few years @xcite . besides , we know that the universe is effectively inhomogeneous at least in the small scale domain . in this concern , the approach based on the zkdr equation is a simple alternative ( together with weak lensing ) for assessing quantitatively the effects of clumpiness phenomenon on the light propagation . as discussed here",
    ", it also provides a simple extension of the hubble - sandage diagram thereby altering the standard cosmological parameter estimation .    in this article , by using sne ia and grbs samples , we have adopted the zkdr approach to constrain the influence of inhomogeneities in the context of a flat @xmath1cdm model .",
    "our results are summarized in table i.    we have shown that the sne ia sample @xcite was unable to constrain the smoothness parameter , while the matter density parameter was well constrained , being restricted on the interval @xmath91 . comparatively to a previous result @xcite , the smoothness parameter was less constrained even with an increase of 375 supernovae . in principle , such a result may be justified based on the fact that the union2 sample has many low redshift supernovae , this may suggest a redshift dependent smoothness parameter already discussed by some authors @xcite .",
    "in addition , the grbs sample also provided poor constraints for the pair of parameters . in this case , the data are compatible with the present universe dominated only by inhomogeneously distributed matter ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "this is also expected since at high redshifts dark energy plays only a secondary role .",
    "the joint analysis provided good constraints for both parameters .",
    "the intervals within @xmath5 were : @xmath92 and @xmath19 , where the best fit was @xmath93 and @xmath87 .",
    "it is important to point out that a smoothness parameter very different from unity is allowed by the current data , which may imply a cosmic concordance model with cosmological parameters shifted by several percent from the standard analysis . in particular",
    ", this means that the influence of the late time inhomogeneities can be important to decide which is the best candidate to dark energy . for the near future , we believe that new and more precise grb data together the zkdr approach ( or some plausible extension of it ) will play an important role in determining the real contribution of dark energy .",
