    "the ferromagnetic semiconductor , gamnas , has been proposed to be a promising candidate to realize all - semiconductor spintronic devices,@xcite where the existence of the ferromagnetic phase in the heavily doped sample sustains seamless spin injection and detection in normal non - magnetic semiconductors.@xcite one important issue for such applications lies in the efficiency of the manipulation of the macroscopic magnetization , which relies on properties of the magnetization dynamics .",
    "theoretically , the magnetization dynamics can be described by the extended landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation,@xcite @xmath5 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 standing for the direction and magnitude of the magnetization , respectively .",

    "in the past decade , the gilbert damping and nonadiabatic torque coefficients have been derived via many microscopic approaches , such as the blotzmann equation,@xcite diagrammatic calculation,@xcite fermi - surface breathing model@xcite and kinetic spin bloch equations.@xcite according to these works , the spin lifetime of the carriers was found to be critical to both @xmath3 and @xmath0 . however , to the best of our knowledge , the microscopic calculation of the hole spin lifetime in ferromagnetic gamnas is still absent in the literature , which prevents the determination of the values of @xmath3 and @xmath0 from the analytical formulas .",
    "alternatively , sinova _",
    "et al._@xcite identified the gilbert damping from the susceptibility diagram of the linear - response theory and calculated @xmath3 as function of the quasiparticle lifetime and the hole density .",
    "similar microscopic calculation on @xmath0 was later given by garate _",
    "et al._.@xcite in those works , the quasiparticle lifetime was also treated as a parameter instead of explicit calculation . actually , the accurate calculation of the hole spin and/or quasiparticle lifetime in ferromagnetic gamnas is difficult due to the complex band structure of the valence bands . in the present work ,",
    "we employ the microscopic kinetic equation to calculate the spin lifetime of the hole gas and then evaluate @xmath3 and @xmath0 in ferromagnetic gamnas .",
    "for the velocity of the domain - wall motion due to the spin current , the ratio @xmath12 is an important parameter , which has attracted much attention.@xcite recently , a huge ratio ( @xmath13 ) in nanowire was predicted from the calculation of the scattering matrix by hals _ et al._.@xcite by calculating @xmath3 and @xmath0 , we are able to supply detailed information of this interesting ratio in bulk material . moreover , the peak - to - peak ferromagnetic resonance measurement revealed pronounced temperature and sample preparation dependences of the gilbert damping coefficient.@xcite for example , in annealed samples , @xmath3 can present an increase in the vicinity of the curie temperature,@xcite which has not been studied theoretically in the literature . here",

    "we utilize this model to calculate the band structure with the effective mn concentration from the experimental value of the low - temperature saturate magnetization in gamnas . the thermal effect on the band structure",
    "is introduced via the temperature dependence of the magnetization following the brillouin function .",
    "then we obtain the hole spin relaxation time by numerically solving the microscopic kinetic equations with the relevant hole - impurity and hole - phonon scatterings .",
    "the carrier - carrier scattering is neglected here by considering the strongly degenerate distribution of the hole gas below the curie temperature .",
    "we find that the hole spin relaxation time decreases / increases with increasing temperature in the small / large zeeman splitting regime , which mainly results from the variation of the interband spin mixing .",

    "the hole spin relaxation time becomes shorter and results in an enhancement of @xmath3 and @xmath0 ( for @xmath2 ) .",
    "moreover , in the low temperature regime , a decrease of the gilbert damping coefficient was observed by increasing temperature,@xcite which is absent in our results .",
    "this may originate from the complicated localization or correlation effects in such a disordered situation .",
    "the quantitatively microscopic study in this case is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "in addition , one notices that @xmath0 in ref .",
    "was determined to be around 0.01 , which is one order of magnitude smaller than our result .",
    "the reason is because of the incorrect parameter used in that work , as pointed out by adam _",

    ", we also plot the experimental data of the spin stiffness coefficient from ref .. it is seen that these values of @xmath10 are comparable with our results and show a decrease as the temperature increases",
    ". however , one notices that the experimental data is more sensitive to the temperature especially for those determined from the domain period in the low temperature regime .",
    "this may originate from the strong anisotropic interband mixing and inhomogeneity in the real material .    in ref .",
    ", we have shown that the vertical spin stiffness can lead to the magnetization rotated around the easy axis within the domain wall structure by @xmath170 in the absence of the demagnetization field . for @xmath171 , @xmath172 , while @xmath173 for @xmath174 .",
    "as illustrated above , @xmath0 is always larger than 0.1 .",

    "in summary , we theoretically investigate the temperature dependence of the llg coefficients in ferromagnetic gamnas , based on the microscopic calculation of the hole spin relaxation time . in our calculation , we employ the zener model with the band structure carried out by diagonalizing the @xmath175 kane hamiltonian together with the zeeman energy due to the @xmath23-@xmath20 exchange interaction .",
    "we find that the hole spin relaxation time can present different temperature dependences , depending on the effective mn concentration , hole density and exchange coupling constant . in the case with high mn concentration and large exchange coupling constant , the hole spin relaxation time can be nonmonotonically dependent on temperature , resulting from the different interband spin mixings in the large and small zeeman splitting regimes .",
    "these features are proposed to be for the estimation of the exchange coupling constant or itinerant hole density . by substituting the hole relaxation time",
    ", we calculate the temperature dependence of the gilbert damping , nonadiabatic spin torque , spin stiffness , and vertical spin stiffness coefficients .",
    "we obtain the nonadiabatic spin torque coefficient around @xmath1 at low temperature , which is consistent with the experiment . as the temperature increases",

    "the gilbert damping coefficient increases with temperature , which shows good agreement with the experiments .",
    "we predict that the gilbert damping coefficient can decrease with increasing temperature once the nonadiabatic spin torque coefficient exceed one in the vicinity of the curie temperature .",
