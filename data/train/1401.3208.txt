    "the advantages of these protocols over their classical counterparts vitally depend on the amount of quantum coherence present in the system .",
    "the physical system is almost always coupled to an environment , which , in general , destroys quantum coherence .",
    "it is therefore crucially important to control and preserve the quantum character of physical systems in which quantum information protocols are to be implemented .",
    "a variety of experimental techniques have been developed in the last decade to isolate a quantum system from its environment in ion traps @xcite , cold atoms @xcite and other systems @xcite .",
    "improvements in computational tasks by using quantum mechanics require the creation of quantum coherence in suitable macroscopic quantum systems which can reasonably withstand decoherence due to environmental noise .",

    "macroscopic quantum superposition in superconducting quantum interference devices ( squid ) @xcite has already been experimentally achieved ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is important to identify systems which can retain their quantum coherence even with an increase in the number of particles under decoherence .",
    "such study has importance also in fundamental questions like quantum to classical transition @xcite , existence of quantum superpositions at the macroscopic level @xcite , etc .",
    "the effect of decoherence on systems of many qubits have been studied by using different types of noise models . in particular",
    ", the effect of local depolarizing noise on the multiqubit greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state @xcite has been investigated , and it has been found that the state remains entangled up to @xmath1% noise for any number of qubits @xcite .",
    "( see @xcite for further work in this direction . )",
    "it has also been shown that encoding of logical qubits into certain subspaces of larger number of physical qubits can lead to effectively decoherence - free qubits against certain types of noise models @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we identify a class of macroscopic quantum states which is robust against a large spectrum of physically reasonable local noise models it is effectively decoherence - free for certain local noisy channels , and weathers decoherence better than other macroscopic states for the remaining channels .",
    "the robustness of entanglement @xcite and other quantum correlations @xcite of the macroscopic state is considered in a partition of the entire system into a macroscopic and a macroscopic part . to study decoherence",
    ", we consider three kinds of noise models : local phase damping , local amplitude damping , and local depolarizing channels .",
    "we refer to the macroscopic states in the class as the @xmath2 states , which have @xmath3 particles in its microscopic part and @xmath4 in its macroscopic part .",
    "the macroscopic sector is built by using @xmath5 states @xcite , or more generally , dicke states @xcite with @xmath6 excitations , and by an orthogonal product state .",
    "the macroscopic parts of the states are macroscopically distinct in terms of their drastically different amounts of violation of bell inequality @xcite ( cf .",
    "we show that for the @xmath2 state , the entanglement as well as quantum discord in the bipartition into microscopic and macroscopic parts do not depend on the number of particles in the macroscopic sector , when all the particles are sent individually through local phase damping or local amplitude damping channels .",
    "the same behavior is not true for the local depolarizing noise , although the @xmath2 state withstands the noise better than other macroscopic states .    we also find that the @xmath2 state can sustain its quantum correlations better than other macroscopic superposition states against the local noisy channels",
    ". in particular , the @xmath2 state , e.g. for @xmath7 and @xmath8 , can withstand approximately @xmath9 noise in both cases , until when its entanglement in the micro : macro bipartition remains non - vanishing , while the values are @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively for the corresponding ghz state .",
    "we also compare the effects of the local noise models on the @xmath2 state with those on other macroscopic states which have unit entanglement in the micro : macro bipartition , just like the @xmath2 state .",
    "such investigations can shed light on our quest towards identifying appropriate memory devices involving a large number of qubits .",

    "in this section , we will discuss about the local decoherence models .",
    "in particular , we consider three types of noisy environments , or equivalently consider that the system passes through the corresponding quantum channels @xcite , viz . , @xmath12 phase damping , @xmath13 amplitude damping , and @xmath14 depolarizing channels . the entire system will be considered to be a collection of qubits , in some initial state , and we will consider the effect after each of the qubits pass through one of the quantum channels .",
    "phase damping happens when e.g. , a photon travels through a waveguide , and scatters randomly .",
    "an initial single qubit state @xmath15 evolves under phase damping as @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 with @xmath19 being a probability .",
    "hence under this noise model , the final state becomes @xmath20 where @xmath21 , are the matrix elements of the initial state @xmath15 . here",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath23 are eigenstates of the pauli matrix @xmath24 , with eigenvalues @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively .",
    "the diagonal terms of the initial density matrix remain invariant under the phase damping channel while the off - diagonal terms decay with probability @xmath27 .",
    "the amplitude damping channel is a model for the decay of an excited state of a ( two - level ) atom due to spontaneous emission of photons .",
    "detection of the emitted photon ( `` observation of the environment '' ) , via a positive operator valued measurement , gives us information about the initial preparation of the atom .",
    "after passing through an amplitude damping channel , the initial qubit state @xmath15 is transformed to @xmath28 where @xmath19 is the rate of decay . unlike the phase damping channel , both diagonal and off - diagonal terms gets affected by this channel .",
    "the errors which happen to an arbitrary pure qubit , say @xmath29 , when interacting with its environment , can be categorized into bit flip error , which transforms @xmath30 into @xmath31 , phase flip error , which transforms @xmath30 into @xmath32 , and bit - and - phase - flip error . here",
    "@xmath33 are the three pauli matrices .",
    "if an arbitrary qubit @xmath15 is sent through a depolarizing channel , the state remains unchanged with probability @xmath34 while the above three kinds of error occur with probability @xmath35 each .",
    "therefore , @xmath15 , sent through a depolarizing channel , transforms as @xmath36 by putting @xmath37=@xmath38 , we obtain @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the identity operator on the qubit hilbert space . here ,",

    "( [ eq : white - noise ] ) occurs at @xmath44 .",
    "it is important to understand the nature and content of quantum correlations that a superposed state of a composite system of a large number of particles can retain , when the constituent particles are sent through noisy channels .",
    "for such an investigation , we define two quantum correlation measures  logarithmic negativity @xcite , for quantifying entanglement , and quantum discord @xcite , a quantum correlation measure that is independent of the entanglement - separability paradigm .",
    "a computable measure of entanglement in a bipartite state , @xmath45 , shared between @xmath46 and @xmath47 , is the logarithmic negativity @xcite , defined as @xmath48 where the `` negativity '' , @xmath49 , is the sum of the absolute values of the negative eigenvalues of the partially transposed state , @xmath50 where the partial transposition is taken with respect to @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "quantum discord is a measure of quantum correlation based on information - theoretic concepts and is independent of entanglement .",
    "such quantification is at least partly induced by the discovery , over the last decade , of several non - classical phenomena which can not be explained by using entanglement @xcite .",
    "there are two equivalent ways to define the mutual information between two classical random variables",
    ". these two classically equivalent definitions of mutual information , after `` quantization '' , produce two inequivalent concepts , the difference of which is termed as the quantum discord @xcite .",
    "quantization of one of the classical definitions leads to the `` quantum mutual information '' , which , for a bipartite quantum state , @xmath45 , is defined as @xcite ( see also @xcite ) @xmath51 with @xmath52 and @xmath53 being the local density matrices of @xmath45 , and where @xmath54 is the von neumann entropy of the quantum state @xmath55 .",
    "quantization of the other definition of classical mutual information leads to the quantity @xmath56 where the `` quantum conditional entropy '' , @xmath57 , is defined as @xmath58 where the minimization is performed over all rank-1 measurements , @xmath59 , performed on subsystem @xmath47 .",
    "here , @xmath60 is the probability for obtaining the outcome @xmath61 , and the corresponding post - measurement state for the subsystem @xmath46 is @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the identity operator on the hilbert space of the quantum system that is with @xmath46 .",
    "the quantity @xmath64 has been argued to be the amount of classical correlations in @xmath65    in this paper , we calculate the logarithmic negativity and the quantum discord of the decohered macroscopic states in the micro : macro bipartition . for the case of quantum discord , the measurements ( to evaluate @xmath66 ) are carried out in the micro part .",
    "in this section , we first introduce a class of macroscopic quantum states .",
    "we then address two aspects of these states : ( 1 ) we consider the effects of local decoherence on these states and identify the state which is more robust against local noise than the other states , and ( 2 ) we study the scaling behavior of quantum correlations of this class of states with the increase in number of particles against noise .",

    "<S> we identify a class of quantum states , each consisting of a microscopic and a macroscopic section , that are effectively decoherence - free when each particle is locally passed through a quantum channel . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , and in contrast to other macroscopic quantum states like the greenberger - horne - zeilinger state , the content of entanglement and other quantum correlations in the microscopic to macroscopic partition of this class of states is independent of the number of particles in their macroscopic sectors , when all the particles suffer passage through local amplitude and phase damping channels . </S>",
    "<S> decay of quantum correlations  entanglement as well as quantum discord  of this class of states in the microscopic to macroscopic partition is also much lower in the case of all the local quantum channels , as compared to the other macroscopic superposition states . </S>",
    "<S> the macroscopic sections of the states are formed , in each case , by using a dicke state and an orthogonal product state , which are macroscopically distinct in terms of markedly different amounts of violation of bell inequality . </S>"
