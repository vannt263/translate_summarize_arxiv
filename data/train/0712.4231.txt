    "one can also construct other models by dividing some selected bonds into @xmath130 identical pieces and adding spins on the adjoint points with properly arranged bonding direction .",
    "the triangular decorated triangle - helix model(fig . 8 ( b ) ) is one of such constructions , to construct this model , we add one spin each on the two bonds branched from the same lattice site .    another different way of constructing is to spiral polygon plaquettes up .",
    "for example , we construct the dodecagon helix lattice model which has the same two dimensional projection to @xmath13 plane as the diopaste lattice . here",
    "it is the dodecagon that spirals up with triangles as bridge between dodecagonal helixes(fig .",
    "7 ) . we can also obtain this chiral spin liquid model by replacing each lattice site in the honeycomb helix model(fig .",
    "1 ) with a triangle .",
    "if we keep replacing the lattice sites with triangles time and time again , it finally leads to the fractal lattice model .",
    "this fractal model is different from bethe lattice .",
    "there is no closed loop in bethe lattice , but in this fractal lattice model , it is all sorts of loops that construct the whole lattice .",
    "these loops form the complete set of integrals of motion .",
    "scale invariance lays in the heart of these exactly soluble fractal lattice models .",
    "now we see that three dimensional chiral spin liquid emerges following a rather simple doping construction .",
    "the only thing we need is local interaction between nearest neighboring spins .",
    "when it comes to existing material in nature , it is possible get chiral spin liquid by doping spins in conventional three dimensional lattice .",
    "in the exactly soluble spin models obtained above , a closed path @xmath131 consists of a series of bonds . defining @xmath132 for a given bond @xmath133 ,",
    "the product of @xmath134 along @xmath131 is a @xmath135 gauge invariant quantity which is nothing but the wilson loop @xmath136 .",

    "the gauge invariant stats can only be distinguished by global operation , which protects the quantum information from decoherence due to local quantum entanglement with environment .",

    "we denote its hilbert space as @xmath154 , the two loop correlation reads @xmath155 which has an explicit expression @xmath156 expressing the spins in terms of majorana fermions , we may divide the hilbert space into different gauge sectors according to the static @xmath157 gauge field operators @xmath158 .",
    "the multispin correlation can be computed on the gauge sectors@xcite .",

    ", we take a more physical picture in the continuum limit .",
    "we view a loop as an electric current source radiating magnetic field .",
    "the topological correlation between loops is equivalent to the topological entanglement between magnetic field circles .",
    "obviously no matter how far the loops are separated , the magnetic field lines are always entangled . when it comes to the knotted loops which are linked , entangled one anther , besides the conventional loop correlation which decays as their spatial separation increases , there exist topological correlation which relies on the global topology of links instead of the average distance between them .",
    "the topological correlation is immune to local fluctuation in space .",
    "each knotted wilson loop operator projects a subspace , this topological correlation is a good quantity to measure the quantum entanglement between different sectors of the total hilbert space .    to study the topological correlation of linked , knotted loops",

    "in which two unknotted rings locked each other up , there is only one crossing point between loop @xmath145 and the minimal surface of loop @xmath159 .",
    "the two loops have no intersection . for a more general case ,",
    "one loop winds around another many times , the winding number is identical to intersecting points @xmath160 the number of intersecting points is identified with a topological number called linking number @xmath161 which can be calculated by gauss link integral of lattice gauge potential .",
    "the three dimensional jordan - wigner transformation mapping spin to fermions defined a gauge transformation , @xmath162 the gauge potential is introduced as @xmath163 the corresponding magnetic field@xcite is @xmath164 with discrete derivative @xmath165 the integral of the gauge field along @xmath166 is wilson loop @xmath167 .    the physicists approach to the linking number of two loops @xmath145 and @xmath168 is using analogy with amp@xmath169re s law .",
    "gauss link integral on the two entangled loops does not depend on the physical meaning of vector field tangent to them , they are valid for any physical vector field .",

    "those points do not contribute to the topological correlation . in the following when we mention intersecting points",

    "witten found the quantum field theory to describe a wide class of topological invariant from the non - abelian chern - simons theory@xcite .",

    "if the loop breaks apart at the crossing lattice site , the topology of link changed , this change would be detected by the topological correlation function .    as one loop expands without cutting the other loop , the eigenstates correspondingly evolute from a state of one loop to another in hilbert space , but",
    "the topological correlation remains invariant .",
    "therefore local perturbation does not destroy the topological signal if the two loops does not intersect .",

    "any wrapping path of one particle around another can be topologically contracted to a point , that means two interchange is equivalent to an identical map , so the statistics of point particles is either fermionic or bosonic .",
    "the emergent string excitations bear exotic statistics in three dimensions . for the simplest illustration ,",
    "if two unentangled and unknotted vortex rings leap through each other , a nontrivial statistical phase may emerge as berry s phase@xcite .",
    "the leapfrogging vortex rings are a vivid demonstration of loop braid group@xcite for a collection of unknotted , unlinked loops .    when it comes to discrete loops in three dimensional lattice , many exotic phenomena pop out .",

    "the conventional berry phase needs to be generalized to a matrix of inner product between degenerate states .",
    "notice that a loop sweeps out a two dimensional world sheet , the berry phase @xmath213 of point particle along an one dimensional trajectory must be extended to cover the extra dimension of loop @xmath214 , where @xmath215 measures the distance along the curve .",

    "a collection of solid angles of different loops @xmath222 constitute one geometric representation of loops . in the continuum limit",

    "exotic statistics phase is strongly dependent on the chirality of loops .",
    "for example , consider a red loop and a blue loop with the same orientation(fig .",
    "9 ) , the exchange of the two loops sweeps out a torus surface , the statistical phase is proportional to the volume of the torus @xmath227 .",
    "if the chirality of one loop flips during the exchange , the world sheet becomes klein bottle which is unoriented manifold with only one side .",
    "there is no definite volume integral for the quantum mechanical phase in this case .",
    "here we take another equivalent but simpler exchange procedure by wrapping the solid red loop around the dashed blue loop .",
    "the dashed blue loop enclosed in the torus surface of world sheet behaves like electric current which produces a magnetic field following the biot - savart law @xmath228 the volume integral enclosed by the torus is computed from @xmath229 if the two loops have the same chirality , the statistical phase factor is proportional to the volume of a torus world sheet , it is positive . on the other hand ,",
    "if the loops have opposite chirality , the volume integral is negative .",
    "generally speaking , two loops with opposite chirality behave like fermions , while two loops with same chirality obey bosonic statistics .",
    "another key element governing the statistics of loops is the total number of particles confined along the loop .",
    "the vortex excitation in the minimal surface surrounded by the loop behaves like quasiparticles of magnetic flux .",
    "we simplify the statistics of two loops as that between two quasi - particles .",
    "if the sum of spins of one loop is half integer , the quasiparticle is fermion . if the total spin is integer , the quasiparticle is boson .",
    "moreover , quasiparticles must carry the orientation of loops , so they have internal degree of freedom which contributes nontrivial statistical phase calculated above .",
    "when the loops are knotted and linked , the exchange of two loops brings topological transformation of configuration of the links .",
    "we first untie , unentangle the two loops to the simplest circle , and then exchange them . following an inverse braiding procedure , we restore the link configuration at their new position , so that one string evolves exactly into the same configuration of another .",
    "the reidmeister moves are the fundamental propagators from one state to another in the hilbert space of degenerate ground state .",
    "in the three dimensional lattice , the exchange of two knots follows recursive skein relation step by step .",
    "the statistical phase factor is no longer a simple complex number but a complex matrix inherited from the topological constrain .    to operator on quantum states",
    ", we need to do braiding operations on the crossing point of wilson loops one by one , and deduce the statistical matrix by using skein relation .",
    "there is a different way to understand the mathematical braiding from physicist s point of view . as shown by witten ,",
    "the correlation function of wilson loop operators in chern - simons theory is a topological invariant of jones polynomial .",
    "we take two neighboring loops @xmath230 as one link configuration , and do a surgery by cutting one crossing point .",
    "then we braid the intersecting point on the cross section and glue them together again , it finally leads to new links , @xmath231 and @xmath232 .",
    "the partition function of the new links and the original link follows the recursion relation @xmath233 .",
    "we repeat this braiding operation on all the crossing points until all of the links are untied , then we exchange them , and braiding them up following an exact reverse operation .",
    "finally we derive the algebra relation between statistical matrices .",
    "this is the whole strategy to obtain the statistical matrix algebra of links .",
    "the operations above sound awfully sophisticate , but it is applicable for both the continuous loop and discrete loops . as for the discrete loops",
    ", we have another different way to their algebraic statistical relation .",
    "inspired by levin and wen s algebraic statistics relation for point particles hopping on two dimensional lattice@xcite , we derived a general algebraic statistic relation of discrete loops using the projection operator @xmath234 , which indicates the hopping from loop @xmath218 to @xmath226 .",
    "if we ignore the orientation of the loop and take the flux quanta surrounded by the loop as one giant particles , the algebraic statistic relation reads @xmath235    the statistic matrix strongly relies on the orientation of loops and the total number of particles confined along the loops .",
    "the total number of particles is not conserved when the loops transformed into another loop configuration .",
    "the hopping operator @xmath236 must be represented by a matrix encoding the information of both the number of particles and orientation .",
    "suppose loop @xmath218 consists of @xmath8 particles , and @xmath226 consists of @xmath200 particles , the hopping operator between @xmath218 and @xmath226 is @xmath237 where @xmath238 are the creation operators of particles along loop @xmath218 and @xmath239 are the annihilation operators of particles along loop @xmath226 . in three dimensional spin models ,",
    "these fermions are introduced by three dimensional jordan - wigner transformation eq .",
    "( [ 29 ] ) which maps spins to fermion operators .",
    "the order of indices @xmath240 encodes the orientation of @xmath226 . for a special case that @xmath218 and @xmath226 have the same particle numbers , the hopping matrix is diagonal for loops with the same orientation and is skew - diagonal for loops with opposite orientation . the explicit hopping matrix on a torus of world sheet is @xmath241 while the hopping matrix on a klein bottle take the form of @xmath242 where @xmath243 is the local hopping operator .",
    "since wilson loops project out many degenerate ground states , even if the loops are not entangled or knotted , the hopping operator does not always commute with each other , i.e. , @xmath244\\neq0.\\ ] ] so there is no longer such a simple statistic algebraic relation as that for point particles in ref .",
    "we have to develop new algebra on quantum braiding of knotted and linked loops , this exploration would be presented in some works elsewhere .",
    "in summary , a class of three dimensional spin liquids have been constructed and chiral spin liquids can be obtained by following brief doping rules on conventional three dimensional lattices .",
    "for example , we introduced kitaev - type s coupling on the @xmath116-sublattice of crystal green dioptase @xmath14 , and derived an exactly solvable spin model .",
    "its exact ground is spin liquid . if we dope spin on its bonds and assume that there exist only short range interactions between nearest neighboring doping spins , an exact chiral spin liquid emerges .",
