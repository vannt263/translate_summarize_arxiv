    "accretion - disk models have been extensively studied during these three decades ( see kato et al .",
    "1998 for a review ) , and several types of models were proposed .",
    "one is the classical standard disk , where the accretion rate is subcritical , the disk is geometrically thin and optically thick , keplerian rotating with negligible infall velocity , and truncated at the marginally stable orbit .",
    "such a standard disk was studied for the newtonian case ( e.g. , shakura , sunyaev 1973 ) and for the relativistic case ( e.g. , novikov , thorne 1973 ) .",
    "when the accretion rate is so low , the disk is supposed to be in the optically - thin advection - dominated state , where the disk is optically thin with insufficient cooling and extends down to the surface of the central object ( e.g. , ichimaru 1977 ; narayan , yi 1994 ) .",
    "such an optically - thin advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) has been examined for the newtonian case ( e.g. , narayan , yi 1994 , 1995 ) , under the pseudo - newtonian potential ( e.g. , narayan et al .",
    "1997 ) , and for the kerr metric ( gammie , popham 1998 ; popham , gammie 1998 ) .",
    "when the accretion rate is so high , on the other hand , the disk is supposed to be in the optically - thick advection - dominated state , where the disk is optically thick with photon trapping and extends down to the surface of the central object ( e.g. , abramowicz et al .",
    "1988 ; eggum et al . 1988 ) .",
    "such an optically - thick adaf ( slim disk ) has been examined for the newtonian case ( e.g. , abramowicz et al . 1988 ; watarai , fukue 1999 ; fukue 2000 ) , under the pseudo - newtonian potential ( e.g. , szuszkiewicz et al .",
    "1996 ; artemova et al . 2001 ) , and for the kerr metric ( e.g. , abramowicz et al . 1996 ; igumenshchev et al . 1998 ; beloborodov 1998 ) .",
    "disk models with outflows were also proposed . for an example",
    ", blandford and begelman ( 1999 ) proposed an adiabatic inflow - outflow solution ( adios ) for an optically - thin state , where the wind is driven by the hot gas pressure ( see also blandford , begelman 2004 ) . while , for an optically thick state , fukue ( 2004 ) proposed a critical accretion disk , where the wind is driven by the radiation pressure ( see also lipunova 1999 ; kitabatake et al .",
    ".    also investigated was a convection - dominated accretion flow ( cdaf ) , where the disk is convective in the radial direction ( narayan et al .",
    "2000 ; quataert , gruzinov 2000 ) . in the newtonian case ,",
    "self - similar solutions were found when convection moves angular momentum inwards .",
    "the effect of magnetic fields has also been studied , in particular , in relation to magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) ( balbus , hawley , 1998 ) , and an accretion flow in which the magnetic forces dominate over the thermal and radiation forces is called a magnetically - dominated accretion flow ( mdaf ) ( e.g. , meier 2005 ; see also shadmehri , khajenabi 2005 ) .",
    "however , the intermediate case , where the magnetic force is comparable to other forces , has not been studied well . moreover , the mass loss and escape of magnetic fields for mdaf were not considered .",
    "when the sufficient amount of chaotic magnetic fields are created by , e.g. , mri and the ohmic heating operates effectively , electrons are heated as well as ions , and adaf conditions would not be realized ( e.g. , bisnovatyi - kogan , lovelace 1997 , 2001 ) .",
    "we do not consider , however , such chaotic fields as well as the ohmic heating in the present analysis .",
    "incidentally in this paper , we consider the effect of global toroidal fields on the advection - dominated disk , taking into accout the mass loss as well as the field escape .    in the next section the basic equations for the present purpose are presented . in sections 3 and 4 ,",
    "self - similar solutions are shown .",
    "we discuss several properties of the present model in section 5 .",
    "the final section is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "let us suppose a gaseous disk rotating around a schwarzschild black hole of mass @xmath4 .",
    "the disk is assumed to be in an advection - dominated state , where the viscous heating is balanced with the advection cooling . in a cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath5 )",
    ", we vertically integrate the flow equations .",
    "furthermore , the flow is assumed to be steady and axisymmetric ( @xmath6 ) , and all flow variables are a function only of @xmath7 .",
    "we ignore the general relativistic effects and use newtonian gravity .",
    "we adopt an @xmath8 prescription ( e.g. , shakura , sunyaev 1973 ) . as magnetic fields ,",
    "we consider only toroidal fields @xmath9 .",
    "for such a disk , the continuity equation with mass loss is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the radial infall velocity , @xmath12 the mass - loss rate per unit volume , @xmath13 the disk half - thickness , and @xmath14 the surface density , which is defined as @xmath15 , @xmath16 being density .",
    "the radial momentum equation is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the rotation velocity , @xmath3 the isothermal sound speed , which is defined as @xmath19 , @xmath20 being the gas pressure , and @xmath2 is alfvn speed , which is defined as @xmath21 , @xmath22 being the magnetic pressure . on the right - hand side of equation ( [ momentum ] ) , the third term implies the pressure gradient force , while the magnetic force is designated as the fourth and fifth terms .    as an alpha prescription , we consider two extreme cases : the @xmath23-component of the viscous stress tensor is proportional to the _ gas pressure",
    "_ or to the _",
    "total pressure_. in addition , instead of @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the viscosity and @xmath8 is the viscous parameter ( shakura , sunyaev 1973 ) , we adopt the form of @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the kinematic viscosity ( narayan , yi 1994 ) .",
    "that is , two cases we consider are @xmath28    hence , the angular momentum transfer equation is @xmath29 where @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) is the angular speed , and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) the keplerian angular speed .    in both cases ,",
    "the hydrostatic balance in the vertical dirction is integrated to @xmath34     = ( 1+\\beta)c_{\\rm s}^2 . \\label{hydrostatic}\\ ] ] here , we introduce the parameter @xmath0 by @xmath35 which is the degree of magnetic pressure to gas pressure .",
    "we assume this ratio is constant through the disk .",
    "the energy equation becomes @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the ratio of specific heats .",
    "the advection parameter @xmath38 measures the degree to which the flow is advection - dominated ( narayan , yi 1994 ) , and is assumed to be constant .",
    "finally , since we consider only the toroidal field , the induction equation with field escape can be written as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the field escaping / creating rate due to magnetic instability or dynamo effect .",
    "this induction equation is rewritten as @xmath41",
    "we first consider an advection - dominated accretion flow , including toroidal magnetic fields , for the case 1 , where the viscosity is assumed to be proportional to the gas pressure . under the self - similar treatment by narayan and yi ( 1994 ) ,",
    "the velocities are assumed to be expressed as follows , @xmath42 where coefficients @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are determined later .",
    "in addition , the surface density @xmath14 is assumed to be a form of @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are constants .",
    "then , in order for the self - similar treatment to be valid , the mass - loss rate per unit volume and the field escaping rate must have the following form , @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are constants .    using these solutions , from the continuity , momentum , angular momentum , hydrostatic , energy , and induction equations [ ( [ continuity ] ) , ( [ momentum ] ) , ( [ angular ] ) , ( [ energy ] ) , and ( [ induction ] ) ] ,",
    "we can obtain the following relations , @xmath52 c_3 ,   \\label{relation1 } \\\\    c_1 & = & 3(s+1)c_3 , \\label{relation2 } \\\\",
    "h / r & = & \\sqrt{(1+\\beta ) c_3 } , \\label{height } \\\\",
    "c_2 ^ 2 & = & \\frac{3-\\gamma}{\\gamma-1 } \\frac{2}{9f } c_1         \\equiv",
    "\\epsilon''c_1 , \\label{relation3 } \\\\",
    "\\dot{b}_0 & = & \\frac{2-s}{2 } c_1 \\alpha gm      \\sqrt{4\\pi\\sigma_0",
    "\\frac{\\beta c_3}{\\sqrt{(1 + \\beta)c_3}}}. \\label{escape}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as is easily seen from equation ( [ height ] ) , in general the disk thickness becomes large due to the magnetic pressure for the weakly to moderately magnetized cases of @xmath53 .",
    "in addition , for @xmath54 , there is no mass loss , while there exists mass loss ( wind ) for @xmath55 .",
    "on the other hand , the ecape and creation of magnetic fields are balanced each other for @xmath56 .",
    "considering these properties , we found two types of solutions under the present treatment . first is the _ conical disk without accretion _ in the limit of a small alpha , where the conical disk is supported by rotation , the gas pressure , and the magnetic pressure . in this case ,",
    "@xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "another type is the _ advection disk under dynamo action _ in the case of a finite alpha , where the toroical magnetic field is injected ( and escaping ) , due to the action of the dynamo effect and instability . in this case ,",
    "@xmath59 and @xmath60 , in particular , in the case of no wind ( @xmath54 ) , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "now , the relations ( [ relation1 ] ) , ( [ relation2 ] ) , and ( [ relation3 ] ) determine the constants @xmath63 .    when @xmath64 at the no - accretion limit , these coefficients become @xmath65 where @xmath66      the parameters of the model are the ratio of the specific heats @xmath37 , the standard viscous parameter @xmath8 , the magnetic pressure fraction @xmath0 , the advection parameter @xmath38 , and the mass - loss parameter @xmath48 . in the case without mass loss , @xmath69 , as already stated . in addition",
    ", the effect of mass loss is similar to the advection effect ( fukue 2004 ) .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=377 ]    figure 1a shows a coefficient @xmath72 , which is a ratio of the radial infall velocity to the keplerian one .",
    "although the radial infall velocity is generally slower than the keplerian speed ( @xmath74 ) , it becomes large with @xmath8 or @xmath38 .",
    "in addition , the radial infall velocity becomes fast as the toroidal magnetic field becomes large .",
    "this is because , in the case of @xmath54 , the magnetic tension term dominates the magnetic pressure term in the radial momentum equation ( [ momentum ] ) , that assists the radial infall motion .",
    "figure 1b shows a coefficient @xmath44 , which is a ratio of the rotation velocity to the keplerian one .",
    "as is seen in figure 1b , the rotation velocity decreases as the advection is superior in the weakly to moderately magnetized cases .",
    "this is because the disk gas must rotate faster than the case without the magnetic field due to the action of the magnetic tension .",
    "on the other hand , in the strongly magnetized case ( @xmath75 ) , the rotation speed becomes faster than the keplerian speed ( super - keplerian ) , in order for the centrifugal force to be balanced with the magnetic force .",
    "figure 1c shows a coefficient @xmath73 , which is a ratio of the sound speed to the keplerian one .",
    "as the advection parameter becomes large , the sound speed as well as the disk thickness become large .",
    "as for the effect of the toroidal magnetic field , the sound speed also increases as the magnetic field becomes large .",
    "in addition , as already stated , the disk thickness becomes large due to the effect of the magnetic pressure .",
    "we next examine an advection - dominated accretion flow , including toroidal magnetic fields , for the case 2 , where the viscosity is assumed to be proportional to the total pressure .",
    "as is easily seen from equation ( [ alpha ] ) , we obtain the self - similar solutions for case 2 , if we replace @xmath8 in equations ( [ angular ] ) and ( [ energy ] ) by @xmath76 .",

    "it should be stressed here that both @xmath44 and @xmath73 become small as @xmath0 increased .",
    "it should be noted that in general case of viscosity : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is constant , we easily obtain the solutions , if we replace @xmath8 in equations ( [ angular ] ) and ( [ energy ] ) by @xmath81 .",
    "we briefly note several other properties of the present self - similar solutions for adaf with toroidal magnetic fields .    at first",
    ", we show the temperature of the present self - similar advection - dominated disk with toroidal magnetic fields .    in the optically thin case , where the gas pressure is dominant ,",
    "the isothermal sound speed @xmath3 is expressed as @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the gas temperature , @xmath84 the gas constant , and @xmath85 the mean molecular weight . in this case , the temperature is expressed as @xmath86 where @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) is the schwarzschild radius of the central object and @xmath89 .",
    "this has a similar form with that of the non - magnetic case , but the coefficient @xmath45 implicitly depends on the magnetic field .",
    "that is , the gas temperature increases as the magnetic field increases .    in the optically thick case , where the radiation pressure dominant ,",
    "on the other hand , the sound speed is related to the radiation pressure at the disk equator by @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the radiation constant , and @xmath92 the central temperature .",
    "then , in terms of the optical depth @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) , the effective temperature @xmath95 at the disk surface is expressed as @xmath96 where @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) is the eddington luminosity of the central object .",
    "hence , the effective temperature becomes @xmath99 in this case , the effective temperature very weakly depends on the strength of the magnetic field , and therefore , it may be slightly changed by the existence of toroidal magnetic fields .",
    "the strength of toroidal magnetic fields becomes @xmath100 in the case without mass loss ( @xmath54 ) , the magnetic field depends on radius as @xmath101 .",
    "this dependence is consistent with the usual mdaf ( meier 2005 ; shadmehri , khajenabi 2005 ) .",
    "we briefly discuss the extremely magnetized case of large @xmath0 limit . in case 1 , where the viscosity is proportional to the gas pressure , at the limit of large @xmath0 , the coefficients are approximately expressed as @xmath102 in this case , @xmath43 could highly exceed unity , which means that the gas dynamically infalls with super - keplerian speed due to the magnetic force .",
    "similary , the gas rotates with super - keplerian speed in this case .    in case 2 , where the viscosity is proportional to the total pressure , at the limit of large @xmath0 , the coefficients are approximately expressed as @xmath103 hence , in this case , @xmath43 becomes ceiling , while @xmath44 and @xmath45 become sufficiently small .",
    "these properties are qualitatively consistent with the results by oda et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "finally , in general case , where @xmath104 , at the limit of large @xmath0 and for @xmath105 , the coefficients are approximately expressed as @xmath106 this means that in the magnetically dominated disk of large @xmath0 the nature of the disk is drastically changed at @xmath107 . for @xmath108 ,",
    "the gas rotates with super - keplerian speed , and the disk thickness becomes large , while the quantities are very small for @xmath109 .    here , we briefly mention on the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) in relation to the above magnetically supported disk .",
    "the structure with a strong pure toroidal field would be unstable because of a variant of mri , especially , in the interior of stars and accretion disks ( tayler 1973 ; spruit 2002 ; akiyama et al .",
    "2003 ; ardeljan et al . 2005",
    "; balbus , hawley 1992 ) . in the case of accretion disks ,",
    "the growth time of mri is about @xmath110 , where @xmath30 is the angular speed of the disk , while the inflow time is about @xmath111 in the advection dominated accretion flow considered in the present paper .",
    "hence , the toroidal magnetic field would infall as it grows via mri , and the strongly magnetized disk could be marginally stable .",
    "in addition , from weakly to moderately magnetized cases , self - similar solutions with toroidal fields may be possible because the fields linearly grow .",
    "furthermore , in numerical simulations of core - collapse supernovae with magnetic fields ( akiyama et al . 2003 ; ardeljan et al .",
    "2005 ) , the linear growth of toroidal fields is terminated by the development of mri , leading to drastic acceleration in the growth of magnetic energy . in the case of magnetized accretion disks , however , a recent resistive mhd simulation of black hole accretion flows by machida et al .",
    "( 2005 ) shows that mri may be suppressed in the strongly magnetized case due to the magnetic tension and pressure , and the magnetically supported disk may be realized ( see also oda et al .",
    "hence , we consider whether the disk with strong toroidal fields is unstable or not is still controversial .",
    "in this paper we have examined the effect of toroidal magnetic fields on advection - dominated accretion flows .",
    "we found self - similar solutions , using the similarity technique in analogy to the self - similar solutions by narayan and yi ( 1994 ) .",
    "self - similar solutions would be valid in the region from about 10 schwarzschild radii to about 1000 schwarzschild radii , in the case that the total disk size is about @xmath112 schwarzschild radii . in the present intermediate case on the strength of the magnetic field , the disk structure , e.g. ,",
    "the coefficient @xmath63 s , slightly depends on the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "however , the tendency of the effect of the todoidal field would become clear in the present study ; it raises the infall velocity , the rotation velocity , and the sound speed in the case that the magnetic tension is dominant than the magnetic pressure , and vice versa .",
    "the properties of the present model , e.g. , the magnetic field , are similar to the results of other mdaf ( e.g. , meier 2005 ; shadmehri , khajenabi 2005 ; oda et al .",
    "2005 ) , although in the present model the toroidal magnetic field is dominant .",
    "this model was thought about a toroidal magnetic field in defiance of a relativity effect .",
    "if the central object is relativistic , the gravitational field should be changed .",
    "this problem is remained as a future work .",
