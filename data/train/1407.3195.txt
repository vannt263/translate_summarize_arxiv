    "in contrast to conventional tmr junctions such a device does not need a second ferromagnetic layer , because the spin locking in the topological insulator already provides an intrinsic magnetic reference .",

    "we suggested a u - shaped 3d device , which is experimentally easier to realize than the 2d devices , but reaches correspondingly high tmr values .",
    "we derived simple analytical formulas for the devices , which provide a quick approximate figure of merit once the surface state polarization of a given topological insulator is known . for the 3d devices we have shown that on an anisotropic surface the tmr ratio may become larger than the one estimated from the analytical formula .",
    "in contrast to conventional tmr devices the devices proposed here do not need a second ferromagnetic layer , as an intrinsic magnetic reference direction is already provided by the topological insulator .",
    "in addition , the present devices provide a means to experimentally probe the surface state polarization of a given topological insulator .",
    "in this appendix we derive an analytical approximation for the tmr ratio .",
    "we base this on an analytical approximation of the surface states only and neglect the effects of bulk states . considering the large bulk gap of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 ,",
    "this should be a good approximation even at room temperature .    to find an analytical approximation of the surface states for a surface at @xmath122 , we expand hamiltonian eq .   up to second order in @xmath53 . as a starting point",
    "we first neglect all @xmath28- and @xmath29-dependent terms by setting @xmath123 .",
    "if we assume the ti to be half infinite with its boundary at @xmath122 , we have to replace @xmath53 with the momentum operator @xmath124 and search for nontrivial solutions that vanish both at @xmath122 and for @xmath125 .",
    "there exist two degenerate eigenstates with energy @xmath126 satisfying both conditions : @xmath127 with @xmath128 , @xmath129 and some normalization constant @xmath130 for the @xmath30-dependent part .",
    "next we treat the neglected @xmath28- and @xmath29-dependent terms as a perturbation using degenerate perturbation theory and get the new surface states @xmath131 with @xmath132 the perturbed eigenenergies are @xmath133 here , @xmath134 and @xmath135 and @xmath136 is for the upper and lower dirac cone , respectively .",
    "if we expand @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 up to second order in @xmath28 und @xmath29 , the solutions become isotropic in the @xmath28-@xmath29-plane and we can write @xmath140 solely as a function of @xmath30 and the in - plane polar angle @xmath141 .",
    "the energies @xmath139 then become @xmath142 and thus only depend on the magnitude @xmath143 .",
    "this expression agrees with the one derived previously in ref .  .",
    "calculation of the expectation values of the spin operators @xmath89 @xcite shows that the spin of these surface states is always perpendicular to the in - plane momentum and lies within the surface plane . as the direction of the spin is the same for both orbitals , this model yields surface states which are fully polarized , at least at the @xmath109$]-surface . here , we allow for a finite spin polarization @xmath73 and thus rewrite the surface state wave functions as a function of polarization @xmath71 @xmath144 as all constant prefactors cancel in the tmr ratio we neglect these as well as the spatial dependence , because in the calculation of the tunneling current only the lattice position next to the barrier plays a role .",
    "the spatial dependence of the fm states perpendicular to the surface is a superposition of an incoming plane wave @xmath145 with the reflected one @xmath146 having a node inside the barrier ( at @xmath122 ) and is thus given by @xmath147 .",
    "note that this is an exact solution of the tight - binding model for a thick fm with zero transmission probability through the barrier . here , the momentum @xmath53 is a continuous function of the in - plane momentum @xmath148 and the ti eigenenergies @xmath139 , satisfying energy and in - plane momentum conservation : @xmath149 since the spin of the surface states lies within the surface plane it is sufficient to write the states of the fm as a function of the in - plane polar angle @xmath67 @xmath150 the transfer matrix elements @xmath151\\ ] ] can then be inserted into eq .  .",
    "in the calculation of the differential conductance the geometry of the device can be accounted for by an additional angular dependent factor @xmath152 .",
    "this factor describes the probability that an electron starting its propagation in the ti at an angle @xmath141 below the fm electrode ends up at the metallic electrode at @xmath153 averaged over the spatial extend of the two electrodes . under the assumption that @xmath154 , which holds for a device which is mirror symmetric with respect to the @xmath108-@xmath30-plane and valid for all devices considered in this work , the @xmath141-integral can be separated from the rest of the differential conductance @xmath155 with the function @xmath156 which is independent of @xmath67 .    up to this point we considered an ideal fm , i.e. fully polarized . to account for a finite polarization @xmath157 of the fm we have to replace @xmath158 by @xmath159 here , @xmath160 with @xmath161",
    "is the relative density of states of electrons in the fm with spin projection parallel ( + ) or antiparallel ( - ) to the polarization angle @xmath67 . defining @xmath162 the tmr ratio @xmath163 only depends on @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath67 . in particular it does not depend on temperature , because the temperature dependence of the differential conductance @xmath164 is the same in all directions due to the in - plane rotational symmetry of the surface states and thus drops out in the tmr ratio .",
    "this temperature independence is lost of course , if the contribution of the bulk states is included .",
    "the geometry of the device only appears via the single parameter @xmath165 .",
    "this parameter can now be calculated for different geometries of the devices . for setups a - h",
    "we assume that all electrons initially moving in positive @xmath108-direction end up at the electrode at @xmath153 and all others at the counterelectrode .",
    "for the 3d devices a - f the function @xmath152 is then simply given by @xmath166\\\\ 0 & \\textrm{else } \\end{cases}\\ ] ] which yields @xmath167 .",
    "for the 2d devices g and h we have @xmath168 giving @xmath169 .",
    "for the device shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dapprox ] we can derive @xmath152 from the sketch shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] . considering an electron starting from the fm at an angle @xmath141 on a vertical line with distance @xmath108 from a vertical line in the metallic electrode ( m )",
    ", it can only reach that line if it comes from the fraction @xmath173 , i.e. the mean probability to reach the line is @xmath174 if @xmath175 and otherwise zero .",
    "averaging over the length @xmath101 of the fm and the metallic electrode results in @xmath176 where @xmath177 is the heaviside step function .",
    "@xmath165 can then be calculated numerically for specific values of @xmath103 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 . in fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] this function @xmath152 is shown for @xmath105 and @xmath171 as well as @xmath172 , showing that for larger value of @xmath103 the angular dependence becomes more strongly focused near @xmath178 .",

    "<S> we theoretically investigate tunneling magnetoresistance ( tmr ) devices , which are probing the spin - momentum coupled nature of surface states of the three - dimensional topological insulator bi@xmath0se@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical calculations are performed based on a realistic tight - binding model for bi@xmath0se@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we study both three dimensional devices , which exploit the surface states of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , as well as two - dimensional devices , which exploit the edge states of thin bi@xmath0se@xmath1 strips . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the material properties of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 allow a tmr ratio at room temperature of the order of 1000  % . </S>",
    "<S> analytical formulas are derived that allow a quick estimate of the achievable tmr ratio in these devices . </S>",
    "<S> the devices can be used to measure the spin polarization of the topological surface states as an alternative to spin - arpes . unlike tmr devices based on magnetic tunnel junctions the present devices </S>",
    "<S> avoid the use of a second ferromagnetic electrode whose magnetization needs to be pinned . </S>"
