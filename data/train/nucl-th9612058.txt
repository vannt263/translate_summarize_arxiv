    "the existence of deformed drip - line nuclei has been recently questionned @xcite on the basis of a detailed analysis of the available data .",
    "tanihata et al . have argued that with few exceptions , the last bound isotopes of a chain could be related to a sub - shell closure in a spherical shell model .",
    "the number of cases supporting their analysis is however limited since the neutron drip line is known only up to z=9 .",
    "a justification relying on results of fully microscopic calculations is not easy to obtain . for evident reasons of simplicity ,",
    "most studies of drip - line nuclei have been restricted to spherical shapes @xcite .",
    "> from their outcomes , it has been suggested that the single particle gaps associated with magic numbers significantly decrease near the drip lines @xcite .",
    "recently , two recent studies of deformation in the mg@xcite and si - ca@xcite regions in which pairing correlations were described within the constant gap bcs approximation have found sizable deformations for some drip line nuclei .",
    "however , no final conclusions can be drawn from these studies since the bcs approximation is known to break down when bound and unbound single - particle states interact via pairing correlations@xcite .",
    "in a recent publication@xcite , we have presented a method based on the solution of the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) equations on a 3-dimensional cartesian mesh .",
    "it describes consistently both the pairing correlations and the asymptotic behaviour of the wave functions of weakly bound systems . in this calculation , the effective interaction is considered separately in two different channels : a skyrme force to describe the mean - field ( particle - hole channel ) and a density - dependent zero - range force for the pairing correlations ( particle - particle channel ) .",
    "tests of the method on the even ni isotopes have shown that it accounts correctly for the interactions between bound and continuum single - particle states . since all the ni isotopes are spherical , the analysis of the results were easier because of the several degeneracies of single particle and quasi - particle ( qp ) energies .",
    "on the other hand , the potential of investigation of the method is broader than shown by the application presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "indeed , it can as well handle deformed nuclei since all single particle states are calculated within a three - dimensional geometry and allows the description of triaxilly deformed nuclei .    this work is mostly devoted to a study of mg isotopes .",
    "this isotopic chain has been selected because large deformations have been predicted for the heaviest isotopes on the basis of the bcs approximation .",
    "also , together with neighboring isotopic chains , these nuclei have been extensively studied experimentally .",
    "many experimental works have looked for deformation effects at @xmath5 in the @xmath6 mass region .",
    "results on isotope shifts of na isotopes@xcite are consistent with an appearance of deformations at @xmath5 although not yet fully conclusive because the measure of the quadrupole moment of @xmath7na is still out of reach experimentally .",
    "more convincing evidence comes from measurements of masses in @xmath8 mg @xcite , @xmath9na and @xmath10mg@xcite , although is not exempt of ambiguities@xcite .",
    "however , the flattening of the @xmath4 curve in mg isotopes around @xmath3 = 20 appears now to be well established @xcite .",
    "systematics of the energies of the first 2@xmath11 states @xcite may also be interpreted as a sign of deformation in @xmath12 mg .",
    "finally , a large @xmath13 value@xcite has recently been measured for the transition between the first 2@xmath11 state and the ground state in @xmath12 mg .",
    "most experimental data point towards the existence of a spherical shell closure at @xmath3 = 20 for the heavier elements : @xmath14al @xcite and @xmath15si@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the vicinity of the one - proton drip line has been explored by langevin et al .",
    "@xcite by the observation @xmath16si , @xmath17s , @xmath7ar and @xmath18ca .",
    "recently suzuki et al .",
    "@xcite have deduced matter rms radii for a series of na and mg isotopes from interaction cross sections .",
    "several shell - model calculations @xcite have been performed for mg isotopes .",
    "they concluded that the inclusion of the f shell is crucial for a correct reproduction of the properties of @xmath12 mg .",
    "these studies also support the occurence of prolate quadrupole deformation in @xmath12 mg . until very recently@xcite",
    ", systematic mean - field calculations in na and mg isotopes have not been numerous .",
    "the present work contains a drip - line - to - drip - line investigation of the deformation properties of the even mg isotopes .",
    "in addition , at the neutron drip line , we have also studied the neighbouring even z elements ( ne and si ) .",
    "in our method , distinct parametrizations for the interaction are chosen for the mean - field and the pairing channels .",
    "for the particle - hole channel , a skyrme force is used .",
    "we have studied two well established parameter sets .",
    "the first one is siii @xcite , which has been extensively and often successfully used to study deformation properties .",
    "the second one , sly4 @xcite is more recent .",
    "it has been constructed with a special attention paid to the properties of nuclear matter and neutron matter .",
    "it is therefore expected to provide a more realistic isospin dependence than previous forces .",
    "with such a choice of two parametrizations of the effective force which are known to work equally well in the region of stable nuclei should provide a measure of the uncertainity of microscopic effective theory at large @xmath19 .",
    "for the pairing channel , a density - dependent zero - range force is used : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the spin exchange operator and @xmath22 the total nuclear density .",
    "@xmath23 is the strength of the force , chosen to be the same for neutrons and protons , and @xmath24 is a constant which determines the density dependence . in this work",
    "we take @xmath24 equal to 0.16@xmath25 .",
    "with such a value close to the nuclear saturation density , the pairing force is strongly attractive at the nuclear surface .",
    "this property has been discussed in @xcite ( see also ref@xcite ) .",
    "a smooth cut - off of the pairing interaction at an energy of 5  mev above the fermi level has been introduced following the procedure explained in ref@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have shown that our numerical method provides reliable results for the properties of drip line nuclei when two numerial conditions are satisfied .",
    "firstly , the dimension of the box in which the hf equations are solved must be large enough to describe correctly the tail of the wave functions .",
    "secondly , since the imaginary time method used to solve the mean - field equations can only be applied to a limited number of orbitals , the number of these orbitals must be large enough to ensure a correct description of the continuum wave functions ; especially those associated with the low - lying resonance states . in the present application to mg isotopes ,",
    "we have used values for the box size ( 15  fm ) and for the number of single - particle wave functions ( 70 for neutrons and 35 for protons ) that have been shown to be sufficient in the calculation of ni isotopes . since this study",
    "is devoted to much lighter nuclei , we are confident that these values are adequate .",
    "we have also checked this point with tests on a selection of nuclei , which have confirmed the conclusions of the previous study .",
    "the mg isotopes are not an optimal region of the nuclear chart for an adjustment of the pairing strength @xmath23 .",
    "indeed , due to the weakness of pairing correlations in light nuclei , the determination of experimental qp energies from binding energies is not very accurate .",
    "moreover , the variation of these binding energies is affected by the strong dependence of the shape of mg isotopes on the neutron number , which must be taken into account in the process determining the qp energies .",
    "previous studies of superdeformation in both the a=150 and 190 mass regions have shown that the value @xmath23 = 1000mev@xmath26 for siii and sly4 gives results of good quality .",
    "we have therefore investigated whether one could use these values for the mg isotopes . to this end",
    ", we have compared the experimental and theoretical values obtained for the two - neutron separation energies @xmath27 , calculated from the difference between the hfb ground state energies of neighbouring even nuclei .",
    "the quantity @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the hfb chemical potential , provides another approximation of @xmath27 . in order to investigate the sensitivity of results to @xmath23",
    ", we have repeated some calculations with the value @xmath23=700mev@xmath26 .",
    "results are plotted on fig .  1 together with the experimental data",
    ". the @xmath4 values are almost insensitive to @xmath23 .",
    "they are also rather similar for both skyrme parametrizations .",
    "the general features of the experimental data are satisfactorily reproduced .",
    "experimentally , the shell effect at n=20 disappears in @xmath12 mg in agreement with the large scale shell model calculations of ref  @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "the results obtained with siii are more consistent with the experimental data than those obtained with sly4 , although in both cases the shell effect is weak .",
    "the problems associated with the description of @xmath12 mg will be discussed in a forthcoming publication .    since the strength @xmath23",
    "= 1000mev@xmath26 gives a reasonnable agreement with the experimental data for the @xmath4 values , we have decided to use it for both siii and sly4 .",
    "we have also checked that it leads to qp energies in @xmath30 mg close to the experimental ones .",
    "more importantly , the fact that the same value can be used for light nuclei and for heavy superdeformed ones is a first indication that a unique parametrization of a density - dependent zero - range pairing interaction may be valid in the whole nuclear chart . with the adopted strength ,",
    "pairing correlations vanish for protons in @xmath31 mg and for neutrons in @xmath1 mg and @xmath32 mg .    on fig .  2",
    ", we compare the experimental data for @xmath4 as a function of @xmath33 @xcite to the prediction of different models . in our calculations",
    "the two - neutron drip line is located between @xmath0 mg and @xmath34 mg for both siii and sly4 .",
    "the lightest mg isotope predicted to be bound against two proton decay is @xmath1 mg .",
    "its two - proton separation energy calculated with siii is equal to 3.31  mev ; a number that is to be compared with the experimental value 2.33  mev .",
    "other theoretical approaches designed to reproduce nuclear masses lead to a better agreement with data than our calculation .",
    "however , outside the experimentally known region , their predictions for @xmath4 show irregularities the interpretation of which is difficult . nevertheless , the trends obtained with the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) theory @xcite and the finite - range droplet model ( frdm ) , are similar except for @xmath35 mg and for a slight increase of @xmath4 from @xmath36 mg to @xmath0 mg in the frdm .",
    "thus it seems that the location of the two - neutron drip line does not depend very much on the theoretical approach , at least for the three types of methods we have just quoted .",
    "hereafter we shall discuss the results obtained with siii unless otherwise specified .",
    "fig .  3 shows the variation of the energy of the stable mg isotopes as a function of their axial quadrupole moment .",
    "as expected , the energy curve of @xmath1 mg displays the well defined spherical minimum that one expects for the magic neutron number n=8 . in light isotopes , there is a competition between oblate and prolate deformations .",
    "all deformed isotopes turn out prolate with the exception of @xmath32 mg . in the heavier isotopes",
    ", a deformed shell effect appears .",
    "it is already visible on the deformation energy curve of @xmath12 mg which displays an inflection point at @xmath37=1.5b .",
    "we find well defined prolate minima from @xmath38 mg to the drip line nucleus @xmath0 mg . in these three cases , a very shallow oblate",
    "minimum appears at an excitation energy of 1.0  mev .",
    "we therefore find that the neutron shell effect at @xmath3 = 28 is suppressed at the drip line . > from our calculations",
    ", it turns out that the onset of deformations at @xmath3=24 only generates a drop of about 1mev in the curve of the evolution of @xmath4 versus the neutron number .",
    "since @xmath0 mg is bound by less than 2.0  mev , we have checked if the large quadrupole moment of the ground state was not caused by a neutron halo which our calculation may not describe properly . to test the numerical quality of our results concerning the space distribution of outer neutrons , we have verified whether the number of neutrons outside a sphere of large radius ( @xmath3915  fm ) @xmath40 was stable against the box size @xmath41 ( @xmath42 is the neutron density ) .",
    "we find @xmath43 to be 0.430@xmath44 and 0.683@xmath44 for box sizes @xmath41 = 16 and 18 fm , respectively .",
    "these small and almost constant values indicate the absence of a halo in @xmath0 mg . in order to determine",
    "which part of the nuclear density is responsible for the calculated deformation , we have introduced quantities @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) depending on a cutoff variable @xmath47 : @xmath48 the quantities @xmath49 and @xmath50 defined by @xmath51 are respectively the square radius and the quadrupole moment values of the fraction of the nuclear density inside the sphere of radius @xmath47 .",
    "> from the results shown on fig .",
    "4 for @xmath0 mg one sees that the asymptotic values of the deformations @xmath52 are reached when @xmath53 is equal to 6.0 fm .",
    "this value is precisely equal to the 5/3rd of the root - mean - square radius of the nucleus ( 3.6 fm ) and corresponds therefore to the sharp edge liquid drop value of the outer radius .",
    "this demonstrates that the neutron and proton deformation , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , reflect a property of the distributions of core nucleons .",
    "the neutron and proton parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 and the total quadrupole moments are plotted in fig .  5 for all the mg isotopes .",
    "values of @xmath56 and of the quadrupole moments of secondary minima are also indicated . due to the conjunction of the @xmath5712 deformed shell effects",
    ", the nucleus @xmath30 mg is the most deformed of the isotope chain . in our calculation , the spherical shell closure at @xmath3=20 is strong enough to compensate the effect of the proton deformed shell closure . on the other hand , we have mentioned above that the deformation energy curve of @xmath12 mg [ see fig .",
    "3 ] displays an inflexion point at a prolate deformation .",
    "this is the first indication of the deformed shell effect which determines the shape of the deformation energy curves of the heavier isotopes .",
    "the values of @xmath54 and @xmath55 for this inflexion point are reported on fig .",
    "5 . as the f@xmath58 shell begins to be filled , the magnitude of the spherical neutron shell effect decreases and allows the proton deformed shell effect to take over in @xmath31 mg . in these nuclei ,",
    "one recovers a proton deformation similar to that found for @xmath30 mg . the experimental evidence based on the existence of a low energy @xmath59 state with a large b(e2 )",
    "value @xcite in @xmath12 mg implies that our calculation overestimates the magnitude of the spherical n=20 shell effect in this nucleus . with two other skyrme parametrizations , sly4 and skp @xcite",
    ", we also find that the deformation energy curve for @xmath12 mg presents a spherical minimum . to our knowledge , this is also the case for all mean - field calculations whether they include a treatment of pairing correlations@xcite or not . apart from @xmath12 mg ,",
    "data on deformation are few with generally large error bars .",
    "still they are consistent with values of @xmath56 larger than those we have calculated .",
    "we believe that this systematic effect reflects the approximate character of the the prescription ( [ e010 ] ) that we use to define @xmath55 .",
    "indeed , it is implicitly based on a sharp edge liquid drop picture which neglegts surface effects which could be of importance in such light nuclei . keeping this restriction in mind",
    ", we note that for light isotopes , the values of @xmath54 and @xmath55 are similar , while they differ for the last three heavy isotopes . with mean - field effective forces , differing deformations are more easy to obtain when there is a large excess of neutrons over protons .",
    "indeed , for nuclei close to the stability line , the large overlap between the neutron and proton densities and the strongly attractive neutron - proton interaction have a tendancy to suppress the differences of deformations .",
    "this is indeed what we find for the light magnesiums . in view of our results",
    ", it appears worthwhile to experimentally investigate whether heavy mg isotopes would not be the lightest examples of nuclei with differing neutron and proton deformations .",
    "on fig.6 , one sees that the calculated root - mean - square radii stay within the error bars of the measured data .",
    "the onset of deformation in @xmath38 mg causes a slight irregularity in the calculated curves .",
    "an irregularity of the same magnitude does not seem to be present in the experimental data around @xmath12 mg .",
    "the single particle level energies in the canonical hartree - fock - bogoliubov basis are shown on fig .  7 for @xmath0 mg .",
    "apart from a global shift in energy , a similar diagram is valid for all mg isotopes . in @xmath0",
    "mg , at the quadrupole moment of the deformed ground state , the neutron fermi level is close to the continuum .",
    "the large density of levels at the fermi surface provides an explanation for the smaller neutron deformation ( compared to proton ) . indeed , because it enhances the effect of pairing correlations , it induces a population of orbitals with a less deformation driving character than the @xmath60d@xmath61 orbital .",
    "results qualitatively similar to ours have been obtained in the rmf calculation of ren et al.@xcite .",
    "both @xmath1 mg and @xmath12 mg have been found spherical by these authors and @xmath31 mg very deformed .",
    "however , the quadrupole moments of deformed isotopes are significantly larger in the rmf calculation .",
    "this may be related to the bcs approximation with a constant gap used by ren et al .",
    "the @xmath3 = 28 neutron gap does show up as an accident neither in the @xmath4 curve nor in the evolution of the radii . on fig .",
    "7 , one sees that the value of the @xmath3=28 single particle gap is about 3 mev in @xmath0 mg .",
    "this is much smaller than the gap that one finds in @xmath62ca ( 5mev ) with a calculation using the same effective force@xcite .",
    "this quenching of the @xmath3 = 28 gap is sufficient to allow the deformed proton gap at @xmath63 = 12 to win over the spherical shell effect and to lead to a deformed nucleus .",
    "similar results have been obtained in a recent study of si and s isotopes @xcite .",
    "8 shows the potential energy curve of the nucleus @xmath34si ( @xmath3 = 28 ) .",
    "the same figure displays the curves of the two nuclei @xmath64ne and @xmath65si which according to our method are on the drip line .",
    "the energy curves of these three isotopes display a soft dependence on the quadrupole moment .",
    "this suggests that dynamical quadrupole collective effects may play an important rle .",
    "one notes also that , as was the case already for @xmath0 mg , there is no indication of a spherical shell effect at @xmath3 = 28 for @xmath34si .",
    "similar results have been obtained by werner et al@xcite with the hf+bcs approximation .",
    "in this paper , we have reported the first calculation of the deformation properties of drip line nuclei using a hartree - fock - bogoliubov approach in which pairing correlations in the continuum are correctly treated .",
    "our work shows that deformation effects can not be neglected in a description of the structure of neutron rich mg isotopes .",
    "in particular , it provides a negative answer to the question raised by tanihata et al @xcite as to whether all drip line nuclei are spherical .",
    "another conclusion of this work , is that the n=28 spherical shell closure is significantly weakened in light nuclei close to the drip line . as a consequence , we find that the deformation properties of heavy mg isotopes are more influenced by the proton deformed shell effect at @xmath63=12 than by the neutron spherical shell closure at @xmath3=28 .",
    "due to pairing correlations , the population of neutron deformation driving orbits favours the occurence of deformation in the last bound mg isotopes .    finally , we find that with the prescription that we introduce to define deformations , the large excess of neutrons with respect to the protons leads non zero differences ( @xmath66 ) in the heavy mg isotopes . a confirmation of this property would be the existence of low lying quadrupole isovector excitation for isotopes close to the drip lines .",
    "therefore , the several original properties predicted by our calculation give an additional incentive to the pursuit of a more thorough investigation of this section of neutron drip line .",
