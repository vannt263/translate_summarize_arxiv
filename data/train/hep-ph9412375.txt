    "what we are left with is the calculation of the properly renormalized operators in perturbation theory , i.e.  with on - shell external momenta .",
    "clearly the form of the external states does not affect the scheme dependent terms of the matrix elements , they are again given by ( [ depma ] ) and therefore trivially cancel between the wilson coefficients and the matrix elements , because the scheme dependent terms are independent of the external momenta .",
