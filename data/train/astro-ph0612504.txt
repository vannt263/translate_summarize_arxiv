    "the swift satellite has evidenced the existence ( in a majority of bursts ) of a fast - decaying phase after the end of @xmath0-ray emission ( obrien 2006 ) , during which the 0.310 kev flux falls - off as @xmath6 .",
    "the emission of the optical counterpart of grb 990123 , measured by rotse ( akerlof 1999 ) , has a similarly steep decay , @xmath7 at about the same time ( 50400 s after trigger ) as the fast - decaying phase of swift x - ray afterglows .",
    "this similarity suggests that the optical counterpart of grb 990123 and the fast decay phase of swift x - ray afterglows originate from the same shock of the grb relativistic outflow . in swift bursts ,",
    "the transition from the prompt emission to the fast x - ray decay is continuous , which indicates that the @xmath0-ray and x - ray emissions also have a common origin .",
    "this leads to the conjecture that the optical and @xmath0-ray emissions of grb 990123 arise from the same shock .    as shown in figure 2 of galama ( 1999 )",
    ", the prompt optical emission of grb 990123 is well above the extrapolation of the burst continuum to lower energies .",
    "then , if the optical and burst emission originate from the same part of the outflow , they must represent different spectral components , optical must be synchrotron emission and @xmath0-ray must be inverse - compton scatterings .",
    "this is the `` synchrotron self - compton model '' which has been used by panaitescu & mszros ( 2000 ) and stern & poutanen ( 2004 ) to explain the hard low - energy spectra observed for some batse bursts ( preece 1998 ) .",
    "kumar ( 2006 ) have shown that the temporal and spectral properties of grbs 050126 and 050219a favour this model for the @xmath0-ray emission .    as discussed by nousek ( 2006 ) and zhang ( 2006 ) , the fast - decay phase of swift afterglows can be identified with the `` large - angle emission '' released during the burst , the emission from the fluid moving at an angle @xmath8 larger than the inverse of the outflow s lorentz factor @xmath9 , with @xmath8 measured relative to the outflow center  observer axis .",
    "any radiating grb outflow whose opening is larger than @xmath10 yields a large - angle emission , irrespective of the type of shock ( internal , reverse - external , or forward - external ) and radiative process . as shown by kumar & panaitescu ( 2000 ) ,",
    "relativistic effects lead to a simple relation between the spectral slope and decay index of the fast - decaying x - ray afterglow , which is generally found to be consistent with the observations .",
    "if , as argued above , the prompt optical emission of grb 990123 and the fast - decay phase of swift x - ray afterglows have the same origin , then the former could also be identified with the large - angle emission produced during the burst .",
    "this conjecture can explain why the optical emission of grb 990123 appears uncorrelated with that at @xmath0-rays .",
    "as shown in figure [ lc ] , the optical emission of grb 990123 is weaker during the first pulse , exhibits a maximum during the tail of the second pulse ( which peaks at 38 s ) , and then decays monotonically throughout the third grb pulse and after the burst end .",
    "the decoupling of the optical and @xmath0-ray emissions of grb 990123 can be explained if the optical counterpart is identified with the large - angle emission released during the second grb pulse ( when the optical counterpart peaks ) and if the optical emission of other pulses is weaker than that of the second grb pulse .",
    "given the simple structure of grb 990123 light - curve and the sparse sampling of the optical counterpart , the lack of an optical-@xmath0-ray temporal correlation could also be the result of fluctuations in the optical - to-@xmath0-ray output ratio from pulse to pulse .",
    "thus , the large - angle emission is not a unique explanation for the uncorrelated optical and burst emissions of grb 990123 ; it just represents a possible reason and a working assumption for the calculations below .",
    "based on the above arguments , in this work we attribute the optical prompt emission of grb 990123 to the large - angle synchrotron emission produced during the second grb pulse and identify the prompt @xmath0-ray emission with up - scatterings of the synchrotron photons .",
    "the observational constraints imposed on this scenario are presented in  [ obs ] and used in  [ model ] to determine the outflow parameters which accommodate them . in  [ extra ] ,",
    "we discuss some implications of the large - angle emission scenario for the optical counterpart and a possible shortcoming of the synchrotron self - compton model , which can be circumvented if the magnetic field decays and does not fill the entire grb outflow .",
    "we emphasize two aspects of the following treatment of the unification of the @xmath0-ray and prompt optical emissions of grb 990123 .",
    "first , we do not assume a certain mechanism for the dissipation of the relativistic outflow energy .",
    "this mechanism could be @xmath11 internal shocks in an unsteady wind , as proposed by mszros & rees ( 1999 ) , or @xmath12 the external reverse - shock , as proposed by sari & piran ( 1999 ) ( fig .",
    "1 of panaitescu & mszros 1998 also shows that a 1016th magnitude optical emission could arise from the reverse - shock ) , and further investigated by kobayashi & sari ( 2000 ) , soderberg & ramirez - ruiz ( 2002 ) , fan ( 2002 ) , panaitescu & kumar ( 2004 ) , nakar & piran ( 2005 ) , and mcmahon , kumar & piran ( 2006 ) .",
    "thus , the scenario proposed here does not represent a new theoretical framework for the grb emission .",
    "second , the calculations below address primarily the implications of the proposed unifying scenario and represent a test of that scenario only to the extent that the resulting physical parameters are plausible .",
    "otherwise , the proposed scenario for the optical counterpart of grb 991023 is motivated by @xmath11 the similarity between its temporal properties and those of the x - ray emission following swift bursts , and @xmath12 the identification of the latter with the large - angle burst emission .",
    "the only observational test for the proposed scenario is the consistency between the decay of the optical emission of grb 990123 and the expectation from the large - angle emission for the measured low - energy slope of the burst spectrum (  [ obs ] ) .",
    "the optical measurements of grb 990123 , shown in figure [ lc ] , are too sparse to pinpoint when the flux peaked , but sufficient to show that a substantial fraction of the post - peak optical flux arose during the second grb pulse . as",
    "burst emission episodes may be dynamically independent , the decay of the rotse optical emission should be timed from the onset of the second grb pulse , which occurred at @xmath13 s after the grb trigger , as shown in figure [ t30 ] .",
    "the optical counterpart emission decays as a power in time @xmath14 , with index @xmath15 .",
    "the available optical coverage of swift afterglows indicates that , quite often , the optical emission decays as a power - law from the first observations , at only 100200 s after trigger ( see figure 1 of panaitescu 2006 ) .",
    "this suggests that the forward - shock contributes to the optical emission just at the end of the burst and motivates us to back - extrapolate the 0.12 day optical emission of grb afterglow 990123 to the epoch of the rotse observations and subtract it to determine the optical emission at that time which is excess of the forward - shock contribution .",
    "as shown in figure [ t30 ] , the rotse excess emission has a decay index @xmath16 , but the power - law fit is not that good , having @xmath17 for 4 degrees of freedom .",
    "the reason is that the excess emission exhibits a steepening decay , from @xmath18 for the first two measurements after the second grb pulse to @xmath19 during the last four measurements ( figure [ t30 ] ) .",
    "if the decay of the rotse optical flux is indeed the large - angle emission produced during the burst and if this emission switches - off sufficiently fast , then the slope @xmath20 of the optical spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , @xmath21 , must be @xmath22 ( kumar & panaitescu 2000 ) .",
    "thus , the above possible decay indices @xmath23 of the rotse optical emission imply that @xmath24 .",
    "the consistency of @xmath20 with the burst sed slope at low - energy ( 20300 kev ) , which briggs ( 1999 ) report to be @xmath25 , supports the synchrotron self - compton interpretation for the optical and @xmath0-ray emissions of grb 990123 because , in this model , the sed of synchrotron and inverse - compton components must have the same spectral slopes at frequencies above self - absorption .",
    "therefore , the sed of the emission of grb 990123 s optical counterpart should be @xmath26 as the only expected spectral slope consistent with @xmath20 and @xmath27 is 1/3 .",
    "@xmath28 corresponds to the optical range being above the self - absorption energy , @xmath29 , but below the peak - energy of the synchrotron spectrum , @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 implies that the 20300 kev range is between @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the peak lorentz factor of the electron distribution with energy in the shocked fluid and @xmath35 is the peak - energy of the burst spectrum .    the low - energy spectrum of grb 990123 , @xmath36 peaks at an energy which is a fraction @xmath37 of the peak - energy @xmath38 of the @xmath39 spectrum .",
    "according to briggs ( 1999 ) , @xmath40 kev for the second grb pulse , therefore @xmath41    the burst sed at high - energy ( 110 mev ) is a power - law of slope @xmath42 ( briggs 1999 ) .",
    "this shows that the @xmath34-electrons at the peak of the power - law electron distribution with energy , @xmath43 do not cool radiatively because , in the opposite case , the distribution of cooled electrons , @xmath44 , would yield a much harder grb spectrum ( @xmath45 ) above its peak energy . barring a chance situation where @xmath34 is equal to the lorentz factor @xmath46",
    "above which all electrons undergo a significant radiatively cooling , this shows that @xmath47 mev , where @xmath48 is the synchrotron energy at which the @xmath46-electrons radiate .",
    "then , @xmath49 kev , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , lead to @xmath52 : @xmath53 furthermore , the observed high - energy burst spectral slope implies that the electron distribution index is @xmath54 .",
    "the emission released at a radius @xmath55 by some fluid patch moving at an angle @xmath8 relative to the direction toward the observer arrives at observer at time @xmath56 where @xmath9 is the bulk lorentz factor of the grb - emitting source , and is doppler - boosted by a factor @xmath57 as discussed in  [ intro ] , in the large - angle emission interpretation for the optical counterpart of grb 990123 , the optical emission is released during the second grb pulse ( which peaks at time @xmath58 s after the beginning of the second grb pulse ) . for a source whose emission switches - off instantaneously , the emission received at @xmath59 comes from the fluid moving at angle @xmath60 relative to the direction toward the observer . from equations ( [ rt ] ) and ( [ d ] ) , that emission arrives at @xmath61 and is boosted by @xmath62 .",
    "after @xmath59 , emission arrives from @xmath63 , for which @xmath64 and @xmath65 on virtue of equations ( [ rt ] ) and ( [ d ] ) .",
    "therefore , the large - angle emission arriving at fixed observer frequency corresponds to an ever - increasing comoving - frame frequency .",
    "then , the above conclusion that , for grb 990123 , optical is below the peak - energy of the synchrotron spectrum ( @xmath30 ) implies that the synchrotron light - curve should steepen at @xmath66 when @xmath30 crosses the optical domain : @xmath67 where prime denotes a quantity in the comoving - frame .",
    "the rotse emission with the forward - shock contribution subtracted ( figure [ t30 ] ) shows such a steepening at about 45 s , the subsequent decay index , @xmath68 , implying an optical sed slope @xmath69 , as expected at the peak of synchrotron spectrum . for",
    "now , we parameterize the time when @xmath66 relative to the epoch of the second grb pulse peak : @xmath70 . therefore , the observer - frame synchrotron peak - energy is @xmath71    the extrapolation of the power - law fit to the rotse light - curve to @xmath59 , predicts an optical flux of @xmath72 jy .",
    "the extrapolation of the forward - shock ( fs ) emission to the same time is @xmath73 jy , therefore the peak of the excess optical emission ( which we attribute to the same mechanism as the burst itself ) is @xmath74 jy ( the forward - shock emission may have started later than the optical peak time , in which case the @xmath75 above underestimates the true synchrotron flux by 25% ) .",
    "taking into account that the slope of the optical sed is @xmath28 , it follows that the flux at the peak of the synchrotron spectrum is @xmath76    the flux @xmath77 at the peak - energy @xmath35 kev of the inverse - compton spectrum can be derived from the 100 kev flux of 0.61 mjy reported by briggs ( 1999 ) at 17 s after the onset of the second grb pulse and from the burst flux decrease by about 40% from @xmath58 s to 17 s : @xmath78    figure [ spek ] shows schematically the synchrotron and inverse - compton sed , the characteristics of the former having been derived above in the large - angle emission interpretation of the optical counterpart , while those of the latter come directly from observations .",
    "equations ( [ epic ] ) , ( [ gc ] ) , ( [ epsy ] ) , ( [ fpsy ] ) and ( [ fpic ] ) represent the conditions which we use to constrain the physical parameters of the synchrotron self - compton model for the rotse optical and batse @xmath0-ray emissions of grb 990123 . an upper limit on the parameter @xmath79 is obtained if the synchrotron power - law spectrum above @xmath30 extends up to the @xmath0-ray range , there are no other spectral breaks but @xmath48 , by requiring that the synchrotron flux at 2 kev ( the lowest @xmath80-ray observational frequency ) does not exceed the inverse - compton flux : @xmath81 which leads to @xmath82 for @xmath83 , which is the lowest value of the cooling energy ( see equation [ gc ] ) , and to @xmath84 for @xmath85 kev .",
    "therefore , under the assumption that the synchrotron spectrum extends up kev energies , the peak - energy of the synchrotron spectrum should satisfy @xmath86 and should cross the optical at @xmath87 s after the peak of the second grb pulse ( 145 s after trigger ) .",
    "if rotse emission is mostly the large - angle emission of the second grb pulse then the optical light - curve should exhibit a break at @xmath66 , which is consistent with observations ( see figure [ t30 ] ) .",

    "the superposition of these sub - pulses leads to intrinsic fluctuations in the burst light - curve , of relative amplitude @xmath118 . if the observing time resolution were shorter than the sub - pulse duration then the amplitude of the grb light - curve fluctuations ( which includes poisson noise in addition to the source fluctuations ) would represent an upper limit for the amplitude of the intrinsic source fluctuations . in that case",

    "the dependence of @xmath133 on the filling factor @xmath216 is slightly different if the lorentz factor is at the lower limit implied by the condition @xmath224 ( which lead to equation [ gm ] ) and the magnetic field at the upper limit corresponding to equation ( [ bg ] ) .",
    "if the electron radiative cooling is synchrotron dominated ( @xmath225 ) then the time electrons spend in the magnetic field and cool becomes @xmath226 ( equation [ tdelta ] ) while , if scatterings dominate ( @xmath227 ) , the electron cooling timescale ( equation [ tc ] ) becomes @xmath228 because the intensity of the synchrotron emission to be up - scattered is @xmath216 times lower .",
    "thus , in either case , the condition @xmath224 for electron cooling during the burst leads to @xmath229 , consequently the lower limit on the lorentz factor @xmath9 ( equation [ gm ] ) decreases by a factor @xmath230 and the upper limit on @xmath99 resulting from equation ( [ bg ] ) increases by a factor @xmath230 .",
    "it follows that , if the magnetic field strength @xmath99 is at its upper limit , @xmath208 of equation ( [ eaic ] ) gets multiplied by a factor @xmath231 , which is close to the @xmath223 factor inferred above for the case when @xmath9 above its lower limit .",
    "thus , for @xmath232 the up - scattered self - absorption energy is lowered by a factor 10 and the model flux at to 2 kev becomes compatible with bepposax observations of grb 990123 .",
    "parameterizing @xmath233 , we find that the grb emission is produced at @xmath234 the lower limit on the outflow lorentz factor is @xmath235 and the upper limit on the magnetic field is @xmath236    the sub - pulse duration of equation ( [ tdelta ] ) is now @xmath237 s , therefore the source intrinsic fluctuations are marginally resolved and the observed fluctuation amplitude of about 10% requires that @xmath238 , which is the canonical value chosen in the above equations . requiring that the sub - pulse duration @xmath146 does not exceed the fwhm duration of a grb pulse , which is @xmath239 s , leads to @xmath240 with @xmath241 because , for @xmath242 , the grb pulse should be a single emission episode .",
    "the comoving - frame electron density of the shocked fluid is @xmath243 where @xmath244 is the shock compression factor .",
    "therefore , the magnetic field energy is a fraction @xmath245 of the energy density in the shocked fluid , where @xmath246 is the lorentz factor of the shock energizing the grb - emitting fluid measured in the frame of the yet unshocked plasma .",
    "if the grb ejecta were not initially highly magnetized then a sub - equipartition magnetic field ( @xmath247 ) requires that @xmath248 . for a relativistic shock with @xmath249 few and @xmath250 , this condition becomes @xmath251 which is close to that obtained by requiring that @xmath252 s ( equation [ bmin1 ] ) .",
    "thus , we find that the magnetic field length - scale is a fraction @xmath253 of the thickness of the shocked gas . for the comoving - frame density given in equation ( [ nco ] ) ,",
    "the plasma skin - depth in the shocked gas is @xmath254 thus the magnetic field decay length - scale , @xmath255 , is @xmath256 times larger than the plasma skin - depth .",
    "lastly , we note that radius at which the expansion of the ejecta is affected by the interaction with the circumburst medium , obtained by using the grb ejecta lorentz factor @xmath9 instead of the lorentz factor of the shocked medium , @xmath166 , in equation ( [ adb ] ) , is @xmath257 which is close to the radius @xmath149 where the burst emission is produced ( equation [ rr ] ) .",
    "this shows that , if the burst mechanism were internal shocks in a variable wind , the dynamics of these internal shocks is affected by the deceleration of the outflow and , perhaps , a large number of collisions are between ejecta shells and the decelerating leading edge of the outflow . that the deceleration radius is comparable with the prompt emission radius is consistent with the subtraction of the back - extrapolated forward - shock emission from the optical prompt flux done for figures [ t30 ] and [ t30a ] : in the @xmath258 case , the power - law decay of the forward - shock emission would set in only after @xmath259 and the 0.12 day optical decay could be extrapolated backwards only up to an epoch which is after the burst .",
    "the underlying assumption of this work , that the rotse optical counterpart of grb 990123 arose from the same mechanism as the burst , is motivated by the similarity of its timing and decay rate to those of the fast - decay phase of swift x - ray afterglows .",
    "as the latter can be identified with the large - angle emission produced during the burst , we attribute the rotse optical counterpart to the same mechanism",
    ". however , the optical emission associated with grb 990123 must be a different spectral component than the burst because the optical flux lies well above the extrapolation of the burst spectrum . in this way ,",
    "we arrived at the synchrotron self - compton model for grb 990123 and its optical counterpart .    the spectral slope of the optical counterpart of grb 990123 was not measured .",
    "future observations of early optical afterglows will provide a very simple test of the large - angle emission for grb optical counterparts : their power - law decay index and spectral slope should satisfy equation ( [ alpha ] ) .",
    "the synchrotron self - compton interpretation of the optical and @xmath0-ray emissions of grb 990123 implies that the optical spectral slope must be equal to either the low - energy or the high - energy burst spectral slope .",
    "the decay index of the optical emission of grb 990123 and the slope of the burst continuum below its peak satisfy equation ( [ alpha ] ) , thus providing support to the large - angle interpretation proposed for the optical counterpart .    in the framework of the synchrotron self - compton model ,",
    "the rotse optical and batse @xmath0-ray observations for grb 990123 allow us to determine that the radius at which the burst emission was produced is comparable to the outflow deceleration radius , which in itself does not rule out any of the possible origins ( internal , reverse - external , or forward - external shocks ) of the burst emission , but points to that , if the burst arises from internal shocks , then most of these shocks must have occurred on the decelerating , leading front of the outflow , as proposed by fenimore & ramirez - ruiz ( 1999 ) . alternatively ,",
    "that the burst emission was produced at the deceleration radius gives support to the electromagnetic model of lyutikov & blandford ( 2003 ) , which predicted such a burst location .",
    "the outflow parameters derived from the optical and @xmath0-ray properties of grb 990123 imply an up - scattered self - absorption frequency of 60 kev , which is inconsistent with bepposax observations , showing an optically - thin burst spectrum above 2 kev .",
    "this difficulty can be overcome if the magnetic field does not occupy the entire shocked gas .",
    "the magnetic field decay length - scale is upper - bound by the condition that the burst spectrum is optically thin above 2 kev and lower - bound by that the shell shock - crossing time should not be longer than the duration of a grb pulse and the magnetic field energy should not exceed equipartition . from these conditions , we find that the magnetic field must occupy @xmath260 of the shocked shell , which is equal to @xmath5 plasma skin - depths .",
    "it is rather puzzling that the magnetic field decay - length is so much larger than the natural scale for magnetic field generation , and yet does not occupy the entire shell of shocked gas .",
    "whether such a large magnetic field decay length - scale is possible remains an open question which can not be currently addressed by numerical models of two - stream instabilities ( medvedev & loeb 1999 ) , due to the large computational effort required to follow the evolution of magnetic fields over such long scales .",
    "we note that other researchers have obtained similar constraints on the magnetic field decay length - scale : from energetic arguments related to the outflow parameters obtained through afterglow modelling , rossi & rees ( 2003 ) have set a low limit of @xmath261 on the fraction of shell filled by magnetic field , while peer & zhang ( 2006 ) have inferred a decay length - scale smaller by a factor 10 than our value , from the condition that , in internal - shocks synchrotron - emission grbs , electrons do not cool significantly during the burst .",
    "there are two other bursts whose accompanying optical emission has been measured . the optical and @xmath0-ray light - curves of grb 041219a ( vestrand 2005 ) are correlated and the post - burst decay of the optical counterpart exhibits variability ( blake 2005 ) , both indicating that the counterpart is not the large - angle emission released during the burst .",
    "the optical and @xmath0-ray emissions of grb 050820a ( vestrand 2006 , cenko 2006 ) are not correlated , consistent with the large - angle emission scenario , but the @xmath262 post - burst decay of the optical afterglow is too slow for that interpretation : the burst spectrum , @xmath263 , and equation ( [ alpha ] ) imply a steeper , @xmath264 decay for the large - angle emission .",
    "therefore , grb 990123 is so far the only case exhibiting a fast - decaying optical counterpart , uncorrelated with the burst emission , that can be interpreted as arising from the same mechanism as the burst .",
