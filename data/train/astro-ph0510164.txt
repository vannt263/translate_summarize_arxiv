    "general relativity has been extremely successful in describing the large - scale features of our universe .",
    "but the global shape of space - time is a quantity that is not determined by the local equations of general relativity .",
    "an intriguing possibility is therefore that our universe is much smaller than the size of the particle horizon today .    in the standard model ,",
    "the universe is described by a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) type metric which is homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "if the topology of the universe is not trivial , then we are dealing with a quotient space @xmath1 where @xmath2 is one of the usual simply connected flrw spaces ( spherical , euclidean or hyperbolic ) and @xmath3 is a discrete and fixed - point free symmetry group that describes the topology .",
    "this construction does not affect local physics but changes the boundary conditions ( see eg .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this could potentially explain some of the anomalies found in the first - year wmap data .",
    "for example , the perturbations of the cosmic fluids need to be invariant under @xmath3",
    ". therefore the largest wavelength of the fluctuations in the cmb can not exceed the size of the universe , and so the suppression ( and maybe the strange alignment ) of the lowest cmb multipoles might be due to a non - trivial topology @xcite . additionally , the last scattering surface can wrap around the universe . in this case",
    "we receive cmb photons , which originated at the same physical location on the last scattering surface , from different directions .",
    "observationally this would appear as matched ( correlated ) circles in the cmb @xcite .",
    "an analysis by cornish et al of the first - year wmap maps based on a search for matching circles has not found any evidence for a non - trivial topology @xcite .",
    "however , it is difficult to quantify the probability of missing matching circles , and other groups have claimed a tentative detection of circles at scales not probed by cornish et al ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we study a different approach which can in principle yield both an optimal test as well as a rigorous assessment of the fundamental detection power of the cmb for a cosmic topology .",
    "instead of working directly with the observed map of cmb temperature fluctuations , we expand the map in terms of spherical harmonics , t(x ) = _ , m y_m(x ) , where @xmath4 are the pixels .",
    "both the pixels and the expansion coefficients @xmath0 are random variables . in the simplest models of the early universe , they are to a good approximation gaussian random variables , an assumption that we will make throughout this paper .",
    "their @xmath5-point correlation functions are then completely determined by the two - point correlation function .",
    "the homogeneity and isotropy of the simply - connected flrw universe additionally requires the two - point correlation of the @xmath0 to be diagonal , a_m^ * = c__ _ m m .",
    "the symmetry group @xmath3 will introduce preferred directions , which will break global isotropy .",
    "this in turn induces correlations between off - diagonal elements of the two - point correlation matrix . in this paper",
    "we study methods to find such off - diagonal correlations .",
    "such a test is complementary to the matched - circle test of @xcite , and if the initial fluctuations are gaussian then it can use _ all _ the information present in the cmb maps and so lead to optimal constraints on the size of the universe . investigating the amount of information introduced into the two - point correlation matrix by a given topology allows us to decide from an information theoretical standpoint whether the cmb will ever be able to constrain that topology .",
    "we will use the following notation : we often combine the @xmath6 and @xmath7 indices to a single index @xmath8 and mix both notations frequently . the noisy correlation matrix given by",
    "the data is @xmath9 .",
    "we will write the correlation matrix which defines a given topology as @xmath10 .",
    "this is the expectation value of the two - point correlation function for @xmath11 that describe a universe with that topology .",
    "all the simulations in this paper are based on a flat @xmath12cdm model with @xmath13 , a hubble parameter of @xmath14 , a harrison - zeldovich initial power spectrum ( @xmath15 ) and a baryon density of @xmath16 , as described in @xcite . with this choice of cosmological parameters",
    "we find a hubble radius @xmath17gpc while the radius of the particle horizon is @xmath18gpc .",
    "we will denote a toroidal topology as t[x , y , z ] where x , y and z are the sizes of the fundamental domains , in units of the hubble radius . as an example , t[4,4,4 ] is a cubic torus of size @xmath19 .",
    "the volume of such a torus is nearly half that of the observable universe .",
    "the diameter of the particle horizon is about @xmath20 .",
    "but we should note that there are non - zero off - diagonal terms in @xmath10 even for universes that are slightly larger than the particle horizon .",
    "we have a range of correlation matrices at our disposal so far .",
    "two of them are cubic tori with sizes @xmath21 ( t[2,2,2 ] ) and @xmath22 ( t[4,4,4 ] ) .",
    "for these two we have the correlation matrices up to @xmath23 ( corresponding to @xmath24 ) .",
    "we also have two families of slab spaces .",
    "the first one , t[x , x,1 ] , has one very small direction of size @xmath25 .",
    "the second one , t[15,15,x ] , has two large directions that are effectively infinite .",
    "both groups include all tori with @xmath26 , and we know their correlations matrices up to @xmath27 ( or @xmath28 ) .",
    "the correlation matrices analysed in this paper do not contain the integrated sachs - wolfe contributions ( cf discussion in section [ sec : isw ] ) .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : we start out by matching the measured correlations to a given correlation matrix .",
    "we then show that a similar power to distinguish between different correlation matrices can be achieved by using the likelihood .",
    "in general we do not know the relative orientation of the map and the correlation matrix , and we discuss how to deal with this issue next .",
    "we then present a first set of results from this analysis , before embarking on a simplified analysis of the wmap cmb data and toroidal topologies .",
    "so far the methods were all of a frequentist nature . using the likelihood we can also study the evidence for a given topology , which is the bayesian approach to model selection .",
    "we then talk about the issues that we neglected in this paper , and finish with conclusions .",
    "the appendices look in more detail at how the correlation and the likelihood method differ , and how their underlying structure can be used to define `` optimal '' estimators .",
    "we also discuss how selecting an extremum over all orientations can be linked to extreme value distributions , which allows us to derive probability distribution functions that can be fitted to the data for quantifying confidence levels .",
    "we finally consider a distance function on covariance matrices , motivated by the bayesian evidence discussion , and study its application to the comparison between different topologies .",
    "a priori it is very simple to check whether there are significant off - diagonal terms present in the two - point correlation matrix : one just looks at terms with @xmath29 and/or @xmath30 .",
    "but the variance of the @xmath0 is too large as we can observe only a single universe . when computing the @xmath31 we average over all directions @xmath7 .",
    "this averaging then leads to a cosmic variance that behaves like @xmath32 .",
    "but now we have to consider each element of the correlation matrix separately , leading to a cosmic variance of order @xmath33 for each element .",
    "the matrix is therefore very noisy and we need to `` dig out '' the topological signal from the noise .",
    "furthermore , if we detect the presence of significant off - diagonal correlations , we still need to verify that they are due to a non - trivial topology and not to some other mechanism that breaks isotropy .",
    "a natural approach to the problem is then to use the expected correlation matrix for a given topology as a kind of filter . to this end",
    "we compute a correlation amplitude @xmath34 which describes how close two matrices are .",
    "we do this by minimising ^2 [ ] = _ s s ( _s s - _ s s)^2 [ eq : chi2 ] where @xmath35 is the correlation matrix estimated from the data and @xmath36 the one which contains the topology that we want to test . for a good fit",
    "we expect to find @xmath37 while for a bad fit @xmath38 .",
    "we can easily solve @xmath39 and find that = [ eq : corpar ] minimises eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi2 ] ) .",
    "as we know that we will have to compare our method against maps from an infinite universe with the same power spectrum , we do not sum over the diagonal @xmath40 ( which corresponds to @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) to improve the signal to noise .",
    "this corresponds to replacing the correlation matrix through @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a diagonal matrix with the power spectrum on the diagonal . if the power spectrum is constant so that @xmath45 then the eigenvectors of the new correlation matrix are the same as those of the original one , and the eigenvalues are replaced by @xmath46 . in this case",
    "they will no longer be positive .",
    "we could also introduce a covariance matrix in eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi2 ] ) . in the presence of noise",
    "this may be useful . in this study",
    "we will assume throughout an idealised noise - free and full - sky experiment for simplicity .",
    "at any rate the wmap data will be cosmic variance dominated at the low @xmath6 that we consider here , see section [ sec : noise ] . neglecting the noise contribution , the covariance matrix is @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "but as the correlation matrices are already expectation values , we end up with a matrix that has a single non - zero eigenvalue @xmath49 .",
    "if we invert this singular matrix with the singular value decomposition ( svd ) method ( setting the inverse of the zero eigenvalues to zero ) and minimise the resulting expression for the @xmath50 , we find again eq .",
    "( [ eq : corpar ] ) .",
    "it is straightforward to compute the expectation value and variance of the @xmath34 function for two important cases . in the first case the universe is infinite , so that the spherical harmonics @xmath0 are characterised by the usual two - point function , a_m^*_= c___mm .",
    "[ eq : infcor ] in the second case the universe has indeed the topology described by the correlation matrix @xmath51 against which we test the @xmath0 . in this case",
    "the two point function of the spherical harmonics is given by a_m^*_= _ ss in both cases the spherical harmonics obey a gaussian statistics and the higher @xmath5-point functions are uniquely determined by the two - point function via wicks theorem .",
    "let us first define the auto - correlation @xmath52 .",
    "we remind the reader that such sums in this section exclude the diagonal terms @xmath40 except where specifically mentioned . for an infinite universe",
