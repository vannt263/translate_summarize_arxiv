    "the presence of a diffuse extended low density warm ionized medium(eldwim ) within the inner galaxy has been established by low frequency(@xmath32ghz ) radio recombination line(rrl or rl for short ) observations(lockman 1976 ; mezger 1978 ; ananatharamaiah 1985 ) .",
    "this component is understood to have a typical electron density @xmath4 of @xmath5 at temperatures of @xmath6 k. the eldwim was first considered by mezger(1978 ) who called it as the `` extended low density fully ionized gas '' which extends from the galactic center to 13kpc and 100pc above and below the galactic plane",
    ". however continuum radiation from this particular medium was first discovered by westerhout(1958 ) in his dwingeloo survey , who also calculated the corresponding upper limits on density and total mass of ionized hydrogen in the galaxy .",
    "later investigators have chosen to call this component as extended low density warm ionized medium(petuchowski & bennett 1993 , heiles 1994 ) .",
    "the recent estimated densities of eldwim are @xmath5(murray & rahaman 2010 ) with temperatures of the order of 3000 - 8000k .",
    "the origin , morphology and ionization mechanism of eldwim are uncertain .",
    "eldwim has been thought to be as a collection of evolved hii regions(shaver 1976 ) or perhaps it forms the outer envelopes of hii regions(anantharamaiah 1985 ) . in the later argument",
    "it has been suggested that by the sizes of hii region envelopes inferred from observations and due to their large number almost every line of sight intersects these envelopes in the inner galaxy ( @xmath7 ) giving the observed galactic ridge recombination lines(anantharamaiah 1986 ) .",
    "more recently(murray & rahaman 2010 ) eldwim has been considered to be a diffuse gas ionized by massive stellar clusters unrelated to hii regions .",
    "the present observations aimed at detecting helium lines from eldwim to understand its ionization spectrum .",
    "the helium ionization potential(24.6 ev ) is higher than that of hydrogen(13.6 ev ) .",
    "the detection and amplitude of he line would indicate the ionization condition of eldwim .",
    "earlier rl observations have indicated that the ratio of the number of helium to hydrogen ions(@xmath8 ) in eldwim is in the range 0 to 0.054(heiles et.al 1996b ) .",
    "this ratio is smaller than the generally accepted cosmic abundance of helium , @xmath9 0.1(poppi et.al 2007 and references therein ) . indicating all helium in eldwim to be partially ionized .",
    "according to order of magnitude calculations(heiles et.al 1996b ; see also domgoergen & mathis 1994 ) this observed ratio in eldwim requires the surface temperature of the ionizing star to be @xmath335000k , if a standard hii region condition were to be considered .",
    "the current knowledge of initial mass function and the total galactic star formation rate make it difficult to realize such a cool spectrum together with the total galactic ionization requirement for the eldwim and hii regions .",
    "this has been called as the _ ionization problem _ ( heiles 1996b ) .",
    "however such calculations are not completely exhaustive and alternate ways to explain the ionization spectrum must be found .",
    "helium rls are much weaker than hydrogen rls and hence longer integration time is required to detect them from specific directions .",
    "wsrt was used to observe hydrogen and helium rls from 15 different galactic positions . in the incoherent addition mode wsrt",
    "offers 8 if bands , each with a bandwidth of 5 mhz .",
    "these were used to detect 7 hn@xmath10/hen@xmath10 rls with n=165 to 171 and 1 hn@xmath11 rl with n=208 ( table-1 ) .",
    "the primary objective was to detect the hen@xmath10 line by averaging the spectra from the 7 bands .",
    "observations were carried out using dual frequency switching with a shift of 2mhz , keeping the average of the hydrogen and helium rest frequencies at the center of the band .",
    "the resolution of the spectra is @xmath12 4km / s .",
    "the 15 positions were constructed from a list of previously observed(lockman et.al 1976 , 1989 ; heiles 1996a ) directions which exhibited strong(@xmath050mk ) hydrogen rls with a single component at 1.4 ghz . a typical line strength of 50mk for hydrogen would imply @xmath13 = 0.025@xmath14 = 1.25mk for helium , taking into account the mean 0.025 of the earlier mentioned @xmath8 ratio .",
    "with this strength for he lines the proposed integration time aimed at a 3@xmath2 detection .",
    "care was also taken to avoid occurence of hii regions along the line of sight .",
    "this was to ensure line origin from eldwim .",
    "a list of relevant transitions and the emerging rest frequencies for hydrogen and helium rls is given in table-1 .",

    "this work presents the results of hydrogen and helium rl observations towards 11 different galactic positions using wsrt at @xmath12 1.4ghz in incoherent addition mode . out of 11",
    ", 5 positions exhibit helium rl detection with snr @xmath14@xmath2 .",
    "wsrt provided 8 if bands each of width 5 mhz which were used to observe 8 distinct rl lines(hn@xmath10/hen@xmath10 with n=165 - 171 and h208@xmath11 ) using frequency switching",
    ". details of observation and data analysis have been given in sec 2 & sec 3 .",
    "these observations aimed at detecting helium rls from eldwim . since the abundance (  0.1 ) of helium is smaller than that of hydrogen it is difficult to detect helium rls compared to the corresponding hydrogen rls . in view of this",
    "a set of 15 positions was constructed by consulting previous rl observations ( lockman et.al 1976 , 1989 ; heiles et.al 1996a ) and the 11 cm continuum map(reich et al 1990 ) . in this procedure a region near to a previous strong(@xmath12 50mk )",
    "hydrogen rl detection at 1.4 ghz was considered .",
    "next during positioning of the beam on the 11 cm map care was taken not to include any possible hii region within the beam .",
    "line detections from 11 of these positions have been displayed in figure 1 & 2 .",
    "the fitted gaussian parameters are tabulated in table-2 , along with the obtained ratio @xmath8 . which is the ratio of line amplitudes of helium and hydrogen .",
    "a detailed discussion of line parameters and their implication has been given in sec 4 .",
    "in general most of the regions seem to be fit to represent eldwim .",
    "this investigation has produced a high value(0.082 ) of @xmath8 ratio which is close to the accepted abundance(0.1 ) of helium to hydrogen .",
    "indicating the presence of diffuse ionized helium in eldwim .",
    "further a weighting scheme(eqn ( 1 ) ) has been adopted to show correlation between line orginating eldwim and the surrounding hii regions(paladini et.al 2003 & anderson et.al 2011 ) . according to this scheme",
    "a weight is assigned to each region depending on ( i)the number of surrounding hii regions within a certain radius from the cloud ( ii)their distance from the cloud and ( iii)the distance(nearest ) of the cloud from the solar system(figure 5 ) .",
    "this correlation has been displayed by plotting @xmath8 against the obtained weights , @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "the conclusion from this plot is that regions with high value of @xmath8 bear a high weight . indicating a correlation between hii regions and helium line detection .",
    "the author thanks the staff of wsrt who have made these observations possible .",
    "the westerbork synthesis radio telescope is operated by the astron(netherlands institute for radio astronomy ) with support from the netherlands foundation for scientific research(nwo ) .",
