    "in the absence of a complete theory of quantum gravity , the theory of quantum fields on curved spacetimes remains our best tool for investigating nature at the most fundamental level.one of the most important results that have arisen from this approach is the phenomenon of gravitational particle production .",
    "in essence what this entails is that in a dynamic spacetime , pairs of particles can be produced purely out of the vacuum . starting with the original paper by schrodinger @xcite , through the seminal work by parker @xcite , up till the numerous present day studies , a considerable body of work has accumulated regarding the subject .",
    "furthermore , the problem of self - interacting ( scalar ) fields on curved backgrounds has been investigated quite extensively .",
    "the main interest is in the renormalization on different backgrounds @xcite and one of the important questions addressed is wether the different spacetimes are stable under perturbations ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "an adjacent topic , but which has been only sparsely investigated in the literature , is the effect of the dynamical background on the mutual interaction of quantum fields and inversely the contribution of the mutual interaction to particle production . considering that in a physical setting the gravitational production is always accompanied by interaction processes , the study of the mutual interaction is imperative for obtaining a complete picture .",
    "birrell , davies and ford @xcite are the first to analyze the effects of field interactions upon particle creation in frw universes .",
    "they argue that the interaction may significantly affect and , for bounce model universes , even dominate the pure gravitational production .",
    "the study of qed processes was undertaken by lotze in expanding frw universes @xcite , tsaregodtsev et.al . in a radiation dominated universe @xcite and cotaescu , crucean et.al . in de sitter space @xcite .",
    "furthermore there are a number of papers dealing with the quantum field theoretic treatment of radiating charges in different frw universes @xcite , at leading order in the wkb approximation or the perturbation theory .",
    "the studies involving de sitter space ( ds ) are particularly relevant due to the cosmological significance of the spacetime . in this paper",
    "we present a detailed analysis of the transition probability for one - photon scalar particle pair production on the expanding patch of ds .",
    "we work in the in - out formalism , with the s - matrix approach . in order to focus on the contribution of the interaction to the transition probability",
    ", we consider the final vacuum state to be identical to the _ in _ vacuum , and define the notion of _ particle _ with respect to the in modes .",
    "the resulting amplitudes are sometimes called in - in amplitudes in the literature . the notion of particle",
    "is defined with respect to the in - modes .",
    "the resulting probability is interpreted also in terms of _ added - up _ probabilities , introduced in ref.@xcite and described in appendix [ c ] .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section i contains the necessary ingredients for setting up the perturbation theory for the scalar qed on de sitter space . in section",
    "ii we obtain the transition probability and perform an extensive analysis as a function of the expansion parameter . in section",
    "iii we summarize the main results .",
    "we work in natural units where @xmath2 .",
    "the expanding poincare patch of the de sitter spacetime is described by the following metric , written in both planar and conformal coordinates @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath0 is the hubble parameter and the conformal time is defined as @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "we consider a massive scalar field minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "the klein - gordon ( kg ) equation in this geometry is : ( ^2_t - e^-2 t + 3_t + m^2 ) ( x , t ) = 0 the positive frequency plane - wave solutions of the kg equation are @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 are the hankel functions with index @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the mass of the scalar field .",
    "these modes define the bunch - davies vacuum @xcite .",
    "the maxwell field is quantified in the coulomb gauge @xcite , given by @xmath10 , @xmath11 . because the field is conformal",
    ", the mode functions can be straightforwardly obtained from the flat space solutions @xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 are the polarization vectors .    with the above expressions ( [ a1 ] ) and ( [ a2 ] ) , the usual mode expansion for the free scalar and maxwell fields can be written as : ( x ) & = & d^3p ( a ( ) f_p(x ) + b^ ( ) f^*_p(x ) ) + a^i(x ) & = & _  d^3k ( c _ ( ) w^i_,(x ) + c^ * _ ( ) w^i_,(x ) ) + a^0(x ) & = & 0 , i=1,2,3 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are creation operators for scalar particles , antiparticles and photons , respectively .",
    "we use a general prescription for interacting field theories @xcite and consider qed processes in the first order of perturbations .",
    "the 1st order term in the perturbation expansion of the @xmath16 matrix is given by : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the bilateral derivative .",
    "we have omitted the four - point interaction term , which is second order in the coupling constant , because it does not contribute to the processes studied here .",
    "+ the transition amplitude for these first order processes is defined as : @xmath20 with this , we have all the preliminaries in place in order to study tree - level processes . in our previous work",
    "@xcite we have considered the emission of photons by a scalar particle , and here we investigate the process of one - photon pair production .",
    "within the framework introduced in the previous section , we consider the process of scalar particle pair creation by a single photon , illustrated by the feynman diagram @xmath21 .    in flat spacetime",
    "this process is forbidden at tree - level .",
    "this can most easily be seen by changing to the center of mass frame of the resulting pair of particles .",
    "due to energy - momentum conservation , the momentum of the photon would then have to be vanishing while at the same compensating for the rest energy of the massive particles , at the least .",
    "an analogous situation is instead the second order process of one - photon pair creation in an external field , commonly in the field of a nucleus @xcite or in a strong magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the first is relevant because of the possibility of experimental confirmation , while the second is relevant in astrophysical settings . in our case",
    "the background plays the role of the external ( gravitational ) field .",
    "this process is also of interest from another point of view .",
    "the interpretation of transition amplitudes and more generally of what represents a measurable quantity on a non - asymptotically flat spacetime is still a matter of some debate .",
    "it is thus desirable to deal with quantities whose interpretation is insensitive to the definition of the out state for example .",
    "the concept of added - up probability , introduced by audretsch and spangehl @xcite , is such a quantity .    in this approach one",
    "calculates the probability for transition between two states of the maxwell field with different occupation numbers , irrespective of what happens to the massive field .",
    "this is accomplished by summing over the complete fock space of the scalar field in the final state .",
    "this method can be employed because the maxwell field is conformal and thus the vacuum state is the same for all times , i.e. photons can not be created freely from the background .",
    "a brief summary of the method of added - up probabilities can be found in appendix [ c ] .    for the specific case of pair production by a photon",
    ", the added - up probability means the transition from the in - state containing a photon ( an no scalar particles ) to a state with no photons ( vacuum of the maxwell field ) , summed over all possible outcomes for the scalar field .",
    "in other words , the probability that a photon `` disappears '' , regardless of `` into what '' .",
    "what is remarkable in this case is that the diagram ( [ 1 ] ) is the only one that contributes to the added - up probability @xcite .",
    "this is not true for the time - reversed process ( see appendix [ c ] ) .",
    "the added - up probability can thus be used as a rosetta stone to translate between in - in and in - out probabilities .      the transition amplitude which describes the one - photon scalar pair production has the following expression : ( ,  , ) & = & 1 _ ( ) , _ (  )  s^(1 )  1 _ ( , )   + & = & -ed^4x ( f^*_(x)_if^*_(x))w^i_,(x).[p1 ] introducing the solutions @xmath22 for the scalar field and @xmath23 for the maxwell field , the transition amplitude becomes : ( ,  , ) & = & ^3 ( +  - )  e^-ii^(2,2)_(p , p,k ) , [ p2 ] where @xmath24 the form ( [ ti ] ) for the temporal integral was arrived at by changing the integration variable to @xmath25 .    the tree - level ( scalar )",
    "qed amplitudes on ds space all have the same structure , with a momentum - conserving delta function arising from the spatial integral as a consequence of spatial translation invariance , and with the temporal integral contributing the non - trivial physics .",
    "the calculation of the integral @xmath26 is given in appendix @xmath27 .",
    "from the form ( [ e9 ] ) of the amplitude we observe that it depends only on the ratio @xmath28 and the involved momenta . unless stated otherwise , in the following we shall consider unit mass in the formulas and plots .",
    "we add to the integral ( [ ti ] ) an exponential factor @xmath29 that acts as a switch - off for the interaction for large times , the decoupling time being of order @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath31 is a small positive parameter that reinforces the convergence of the integral .",
    "effectively we consider it to be a small but finite constant in our calculations , and discuss the vanishing limit at the end of the paper .",
    "the partial probability , averaged over the photon polarizations , is obtained as :    ( ,  , ) & = & _ = 1   ( ,  , )  ^2 [ pp1 ] the delta term can be handled , following the prescription from flat space scattering theory , by writing ( 2)^3 ^ 3()^2 = ( 2)^6 ^(3)(0)^3 ( ) = ( 2)^3  v  ^3 ( ) , where @xmath32 is the comoving volume .",
    "the physical volume is @xmath33 .",
    "one then usually considers the probability per unit volume . in the following",
    "we will shorthand this quantity with just the probability , remembering that what we really mean is in fact the probability per unit comoving volume .",

    "+ gathering all terms and using the notations from appendix @xmath27 , the probability becomes : [ pp ] ( ,  , ) & = & ^3(+ - )  [ p1 ] + & & g_(p , p,k ) + g_-(p , p,k)+ h_(p , p,k)+ h_-(p , p,k)^2.the quantity ( [ pp ] ) is to be interpreted as the momentum space distribution of the total probability : ( ,  , ) = , from where the total probability is defined as : p(k ) = d^3pd^3p  ( ,  , ) we shall also consider the following the quantity @xmath41 notice that the delta function makes the above integral trivial .    for later use",
    ", we obtain the expression of the probability for the particular value @xmath42 , where the hankel functions have simple analytical forms ( [ h12 ] ) and the temporal integral can be readily evaluated :    [ ic ] i^(2,2)_(p , p,k ) & = & de^-ipe^-ip  e^ik + & = & d  e^-i(p+p - k ) + & = & the probability thus becomes : ( k , p , ) =  , where we have restored the @xmath31 parameter for clarity , and it is understood that @xmath43 .",
    "the simple form of the probability in this case makes it particularly suitable for numerical and analytical manipulations , and will be exploited accordingly in the following .",
    "we note that for this particular case the mode functions reduce to the flat - space plane - waves , and the scalar field effectively behaves as a massless conformally coupled field .",
    "one would then expect that the probability be null as in the flat space case .",
    "the probability is indeed equal to the flat space one , but neither of them are in fact null .",
    "this can be seen by identifying the conformal time @xmath44 with the minkowski time in eq .",
    "we observe that the integration is only over the semi - infinite interval .",
    "this is because the expanding patch of ds is only _ locally _ conformal to minkowski space .",
    "the integration up to a finite time in flat space can be understood as a sudden decoupling of the fields at a finite time .",
    "this would then lead to transient effects giving the probability a non - null value .",
    "translating back to the expanding ds space , what in flat space was due to ( unphysical ) transient effects , now represents the physical probability rendered so by the nature of the spacetime .",
    "the probability can be evaluated analytically for @xmath45 ( weak gravitational regime ) , with the aid of an approximation . from the expression ( [ p1 ] ) , the @xmath46 terms which contain an appell @xmath47 function are the ones that resist analytical manipulation . we have found that the approximation [ f4 ] f_4(1,3/2,1+,1-,x , y ) 1 , works very well for large @xmath48 .",
    "a more detailed discussion can be found in appendix ( [ a.2 ] ) .",
    "an alternative option is to numerically integrate the temporal integral in ( [ p2 ] ) , which we shall do for the domain @xmath49 ( strong gravitational regime ) , where the above approximation is not accurate .",

    "the overall conclusion to be drawn is that even tough there is the possibility of energy exchange with the dynamic background , the probability is peaked in the vicinity of the energy conserving case ( @xmath54 ) . to get an intuitive picture one can think of the configuration of momenta in compton scattering in flat space . in that case",
    "the scattering at backward angles is forbidden by the simultaneous energy - momentum conservation law , as is the case where the photon gains momentum as a result of the process . in the somewhat analogous situation for our process of pair production in de sitter space , the backward `` scattering '' and production of large momentum pairs , although not forbidden , are heavily suppressed . on the other hand , a significant relative increase in the probability of production at intermediate angles , corresponding to production in the forward quadrants , is clearly visible as the strength of the gravitational field increases . also , notice that while in a weak field the probability has a maximum at @xmath55 , in the strong field case the probability is the same throughout the interval @xmath56 .      to characterize the angular behaviour of the probability with varying strength of the gravitational field",

    "semi_-infinite axis , the amplitude will actually be similar to that in flat space , but where the interaction has been suddenly decoupled at time @xmath63 .",
    "this would then lead to transient effects and an uv divergence when integrated over the momenta of the particles , as was reported also in ref.@xcite .    in order to extract a quantity which gives at least qualitative information about the angular behaviour",
    ", we effectively integrate the momentum up to a maximum value @xmath64 . observing that the probability is highest in the interval @xmath56 , as can be seen from fig.([2 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) , we consider it sufficient to take @xmath65 in order to illustrate the variation of the mean production angle .",

    "we note that the two intermediate values may not be very accurate because of the errors in the numerical integration , but they are in conformity with the overall trend .",
    "as we have mentioned , this process is forbidden in flat space because of incompatibility with energy - momentum conservation .",
    "this implies that the probability in ds space must vanish in the limit @xmath67 . to get a better picture of the behaviour",
    ", we keep the leading term in @xmath28 in the probability , and seek the approximate expression around three different angular configurations between the involved momenta .    the main contribution to the probability in the flat limit comes from the @xmath68 term in ( [ pp ] ) .",

    "the difference among the three particular angular configurations is striking . for the one - photon pair production process in ds space",

    "the coherence of the results acts as check for the validity of the methods .",
    "the resulting probability distribution was represented as a surface in the momentum space ( fig.[2 ] ) .",
    "we have found that there is a moderate interaction ( i.e. energy exchange ) with the background :    * in general the probability is concentrated around the configuration that is closest to the energy conservation condition ( @xmath82 ) * by turning up the strength of the gravitational field , the production at intermediate angles is enhanced , while remaining vanishingly small for backward scattered and high momentum pairs .    to make the above description more precise ,",
    "we have calculated the mean emission angle for various configurations and have found accordingly that it increases / decreases with the increase / decrease of the expansion parameter . in the flat limit the mean angle goes to zero and probability vanishes as expected .",
    "surprisingly , the fall of the probability is rather mild for small angle production .    to investigate this behaviour ,",
    "we have approximated the expression of the probability in the vicinity of different angular configurations , while keeping only the leading term in @xmath28 .",
    "we have found that the the probability falls off as @xmath73 , with @xmath74 .",
    "this behaviour carries over to other tree - level processes , and probably also to higher order processes .",

    "our results then seem to suggest that even for a scalar field with compton wavelength much smaller than the hubble radius ( @xmath83 in natural units ) , the probability of pair production around small angles can remain non - negligible for the present expansion .",
    "the fact that we do not observe this process for example for the cmb photons , gives a lower bound for the possible masses of such ultra - light particles .",
    "such scalar fields , with compton wavelengths between hubble and galactic order , have been popular in recent years in beyond the standard model physics , as candidates for dark matter and dark energy .",
    "we signal that these small angle results have to be taken with a dose of skepticism .",

    "the method of added - up probabilities , introduced by audretsch and spangehl in ref.@xcite , gives a nice way of interpreting in - in amplitudes in terms of quantities , the definition of which is invariant to the nature of the out state .",
    "the problem to which it offers a solution is the following : in a setting with interacting fields on a dynamical background , when calculating scattering amplitudes in the s - matrix approach , the effects of the interaction can not , in general , be separated from the cosmological pair creation .    in a quasi - flat spacetime , where the cosmological particle production is negligible",
    ", one can do the usual minkowskian perturbation theory . on the other hand , for strong gravitational fields",
    "it is not clear whether and how one can neglect or subtract the effects of the cosmological particle production .",
    "an alternative possibility is to work with a notion of global measuring apparatus as in ref.@xcite , and interpret the in - in probabilities as the sole contribution of the mutual interaction , separate from the pure cosmological pair production .    in the particular case",
    "when one of the fields is conformal , for example the maxwell field in qed , the definition of the vacuum is unambiguous .",
    "this means that quanta of this field can not be created freely from the vacuum , which in turn means that they are good indicators for the effects of the interaction , as the authors of ref.@xcite point out .",
    "the physically measurable quantity then , they argue , is the probability of measuring a certain final state for the conformal field , regardless of the state of the other fields , given a fixed initial configuration . in qft",
    "language this means that the summed probability is obtained by summing and integrating over the complete fock space of the other fields in the final state .",
    "if we want for example , in the context of tree - level scalar qed , to calculate the summed probability for finding no photons , given a photon in the initial state , the summed probability is : [ c.1 ] w^add _ # ( p , p,k ) & = & _ #   0_m ; # s^(1 ) 1_(,);0 _ ^2 + & = & _ #   1 _ ( , ) ; 0 _ s^(1 ) 0_m ; # 0_m ; # s^(1 ) 1_(,);0 _ , where @xmath105 and @xmath106 represent the vacuum states of the maxwell and scalar field , and # stands for the complete out fock space for the scalar field .",
    "_ # = d^3p_1 + d^3p_1 d^3p_2 + ... = _ n _ i=0^n d^3p_i we observe by writing @xmath107 in ( [ c.1 ] ) , that we have obtained an identity operator for the scalar sector .",
    "we can thus insert any orthonormal base in place of @xmath108 , in particular we can insert an in base .",
    "_ # # # _ in in in this turns out to be the best solution for calculating such probabilities , as the summed probability turns into a finite sum of in - in probabilities . in the particular case of ( [ c.1 ] ) ,",
    "the only term that contributes to the sum is the pair production process ( fig .",
    "w^add _ # = 1_(),_( ) s^(1 ) 1 _ ( , ) ^2 this means that the in - in probability for one - photon pair production is equivalent , through the notion of the summed probability , with the probability that a photon is absorbed , regardless of the mechanism ( regardless of `` into what '' it is absorbed ) .",
    "it may seem that this is not saying much , but we must note that the second part of the above statement describes a quantity which makes no assumption on the nature of the out state of the scalar field .",
    "as a further example , we evaluate the summed probability that is correlate to the one - photon annihilation process , the time - inversed version of fig.([1 ] ) .",
    "this is interpreted as the probability of measuring a photon with momentum @xmath50 in the out state ( irrespective of the state of the scalar field ) , given a pair of scalar particles in the initial state . w^add _",

    "1_(,);1_(),_(--),1_(),_( ) s^(1)1_(),_( ) ^2 the first term represents the one - photon annihilation process .",
    "the others are emission and triplet production processes , respectively , where the other particles pass through to the final state unchanged .",
    "these are the processes that are indistinguishable from the point of view of a photon counter that measures the number of photons in the final state @xcite .",
