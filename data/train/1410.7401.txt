    "high-@xmath19 quasars are key probes of the early universe . while the most distant quasars identified so far have been discovered by the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ; @xcite ) and the vista kilo - degree infrared galaxy ( viking : @xcite ) , the number of luminous quasars at @xmath20 has been significantly increased by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) the high-@xmath19 quasars are regarded as important sites to understand the formation process of super massive black holes ( smbhs ) in the early universe . the mass of smbhs in some of sdss quasars at @xmath20 has been measured to be @xmath21 .",
    "the constraint of the quasar number density in early epochs is very important to revise formation and evolution models of early quasars / smbhs on timescales as short as @xmath221gyr ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the first generation smbhs are generally supposed to have formed by merging assembly of seed bhs with smaller masses @xcite .",
    "observational constraints on the timescale of smbh formation may identify the seed bhs , which might be bhs as the remnants of the popiii stars with @xmath23 @xcite or bhs with @xmath24 generated by disk instability of protogalaxies @xcite .",
    "the quasar activity is generally thought to be maintained by mass accretion to a smbh of @xmath25 , which had to be formed within a few gyr in the early epoch .",
    "several specific formation scenarios for quasars / smbhs with co - evolving host galaxies are proposed to explain these short timescales ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; however these models will be strongly constrained by the observational measurements of smbh mass function and eddington ratio distribution",
    ".    moreover , these high-@xmath19 quasars are among the distant bright beacons to light up many physical properties of the foreground intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "the sdss studies have made an important remark that high-@xmath19 quasars can be used to probe the physical conditions of the igm at high @xmath19 through absorption line features in the spectra , taking advantage of their intrinsic large luminosity .",
    "the evolution of the gunn - peterson ( gp ) optical depth in sdss high-@xmath19 quasars suggests that the end of the cosmic reionization process is at around @xmath26 and that the cosmic neutral hydrogen fraction , @xmath27 , at @xmath28 is significantly greater than zero @xcite .",
    "the igm opacity was found to dramatically increase from @xmath29 to @xmath30 at @xmath31 by gp measurements , suggesting rapid evolution of the @xmath27 in the early universe .",
    "it is also suggested that @xmath27 has a large variation from field to field , indicating a spatially patchy reionizing process ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which might be caused by an initial large - scale structure of uv ionizing sources , such as quasars and galaxies .",
    "however , it is still difficult to quantitatively investigate the inhomogeneity due to the extremely low number density of high - z luminous quasars .",
    "the metal absorption lines arose in the high-@xmath19 quasar spectra are the only observational clue to the early history of the metal enrichment of the universe , which is closely related to the star formation history in the reionization epoch .",
    "the igm metallicity was found to show a possible downturn at @xmath20 @xcite , indicating rapid metal enrichment by early feedbacks from early galaxies or popiiis .",
    "these observations strongly suggest that quasars at @xmath20 are extremely important to expand our knowledge of the cosmic frontier toward the so - called dark age .",
    "as described above , some topics related to high-@xmath19 quasars have been advanced by sdss , which has provided @xmath32 bright quasars at @xmath0 over a @xmath33 deg@xmath34 wide - field survey @xcite",
    ". however , the sdss sample contains only extremely luminous active galactic nuclei ( agns ) due to the shallow limiting magnitude of the sdss images .",
    "this limitation prevents us from investigating the whole shape of the agn luminosity function , which is important to study the smbh mass function and its evolution .",
    "the lack of observational evidence of the chemical evolution in the agns may be due to the bias toward high luminosity .",
    "very deep surveys targeting fainter quasars than the current observations is required to overcome these issues .",
    "we carried out the faint quasar survey with the subaru telescope , which has a very large field of view ( fov : @xmath35 arcmin@xmath34 ) camera , suprime - cam .",
    "we used the @xmath36 ( @xmath37 , fwhm@xmath38 ) and @xmath39 ( @xmath8 , @xmath40 ) filters , which are custom - made , dividing the sdss @xmath19 band into two at @xmath41  @xcite .",
    "although the original main objective of the survey was to find quasars at @xmath42 with ( @xmath4 ) vs. ( @xmath43 ) color selection , @xmath0 quasars can simultaneously be selected out by using ( @xmath44 ) vs. ( @xmath4 ) colors .",
    "suprime - cam has new red - sensitive ccds , that have high sensitivity in the @xmath36/@xmath39 bands .",
    "this project is a new search for the distant quasars at @xmath0 and @xmath45 that utilizes the unique capabilities of the wide - field imaging of suprime - cam , its high - sensitivity ccds at @xmath46 m , and @xmath36/@xmath39 filters to effectively isolate high-@xmath19 quasars from l / t dwarfs .",
    "this very deep survey is complementary to other current quasar surveys , _",
    "e.g. _ , ukidss / las @xcite , canada - france high-@xmath19 quasar survey ( cfhqs ; @xcite ) , sdss - deep @xcite , and panoramic survey telescope & rapid response system ( pan - starrs ; @xcite ) mainly targeting bright quasars at @xmath0 down to @xmath47 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we describe the observation and data reduction of the survey . in section 3 , we describe the method to select @xmath0 quasars . in section 4",
    ", we present the result of our follow - up spectroscopic observations . after estimating the completeness of our sample",
    "as described in section 5 , we evaluate the quasar luminosity function ( qlf ) at @xmath0 in section 6 .",
    "several discussions of the initial smbh formation and implications for reionization are made in section 7 , and a summary of the paper is provided in section 8 , along with a discussion of future prospects .    throughout the paper , we assume the following cosmology parameters : @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 @xmath51",
    "km s@xmath18 mpc@xmath18 .",
    "these parameters are consistent with recent cosmic microwave background constraints @xcite .",
    "magnitudes are given in the ab system .",
    "we obtained wide and deep @xmath36/@xmath39 images with suprime - cam for @xmath45 deg@xmath34 in total for three ukidss - deep extragalactic survey ( ukidss - dxs ; @xcite ) fields ( `` lockman hole `` : @xmath52 ( j2000 ) : 1.53 deg@xmath34 , `` elais n1 '' : @xmath53 ( j2000 ) : 2.55 deg@xmath34 , and `` vimos 4 `` '' : @xmath54 ( j2000 ) : 3.06 deg@xmath34 fields ) .",
    "we retrieved the @xmath9 and @xmath55-band images from ukidss - dxs dr5 . since the survey was originally designed to detect @xmath42 quasars as well , we selected survey fields where deep @xmath9-band photometry is available .",
    "observations were made on the nights of ut @xmath56 june 22 - 24 .",
    "suprime - cam has ten @xmath57k @xmath58k mit / ll ccds and covers a contiguous area of @xmath59 with a pixel scale of @xmath60 pixel@xmath18 .",
    "three dxs / j - band fields have been covered by @xmath61 fovs of suprime - cam .",
    "the transmission curves of @xmath36 and @xmath39-band filters were presented in @xcite .",
    "the unit exposure time for each filter was determined so that the photon counts per pixel of the sky background would reach an appropriate value .",
    "the total integration time was @xmath62 and @xmath63s for the @xmath36 and @xmath39 bands , respectively .",
    "we adopted a common dithering circle pattern of a full cycle of dithering consisting of five pointings .",
    "the sky condition was very good with a seeing size of @xmath64 arcsec .",
    "the data were reduced using the pipeline software package sdfred @xcite .",
    "the package includes bias subtraction , flat - fielding , a correction for image distortion due to the prime - focus optics , point - spread function ( psf ) matching , sky subtraction , and mosaicking .",
    "photometric calibration was made with spectroscopic standard stars gd153 and feige110 .",
    "the `` vimos 4 `` field is covered by the cfhtls @xmath65 band with the limiting magnitude of @xmath66 ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 , ab ) .",
    "the deep @xmath65-band data on the `` lockman hole '' and `` elais n1 \" fields provided by toru yamada were taken by the other project , which covers almost @xmath69 deg@xmath34 out of our @xmath70 deg@xmath34 survey area .",
    "therefore , the total survey area to search for @xmath0 quasars is @xmath71 deg@xmath34 , limited by the available area of the @xmath65-band image .",
    "we obtained sufficient deep images down to @xmath72 ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 , ab ) and @xmath73 .",
    "these limiting magnitudes are almost the same ( @xmath74mag @xmath75 ) for all the three ukidss - dxs fields by virtue of the stable observational condition .",
    "we measured the limiting magnitude of ukidss @xmath9 and @xmath55-band images with the same procedure and under the same conditions ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 , ab ) , and obtained @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the limiting magnitude of the @xmath78-band image was estimated to be @xmath79 and @xmath80 for the lockman / elais fields and the vimos field , respectively .",
    "we performed object detection and photometry by running sextractor version 2.8.6 @xcite on the images .",
    "object detection was made in the @xmath39-band images .",
    "we detected objects that had six connected pixels above @xmath81 of the sky background rms noise and took photometric measurements at the @xmath81 level .",
    "aperture photometry was performed with a @xmath82 aperture to derive the colors of the detected objects .",
    "for all objects detected in a given bandpass , the magnitudes and several other photometric parameters were measured in the other bandpasses at exactly the same positions as in the detection - band image , using the `` double image mode  of sextractor .",
    "object detection and photometry were significantly less efficient and reliable close to very bright stars due to bright halos and saturation trails .",
    "a similar degradation occurred near the edges of the images because of a low signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we carefully defined `` masked regions \" corresponding to these low - quality areas and removed all objects falling within the masked regions . after removing the masked regions , the final effective survey area was @xmath1 deg@xmath34 .",
    "we selected quasar candidates at @xmath0 down to @xmath83 ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 , ab ) with @xmath3 and @xmath4 color selection . the color diagram ( figure  [ fig_2col ] )",
    "was drawn based on one million objects detected in the @xmath39 band .",
    "these colors were measured in a @xmath68 aperture . to identify the expected position of quasars at @xmath0 on the color diagram and to derive the sample completeness ( see section 5 ) , the quasar spectral energy distribution ( sed ) model was generated . an alternative way to simulate the color distribution of the underlying high-@xmath19 quasars is to use the quasar spectra observed at low @xmath19 and shift them to target redshifts ; however , these low-@xmath19 quasar samples had already passed through some specific color criteria , and we worried that a selection bias could be embedded in the sample .",
    "instead , we generated model quasar seds , and the possible variety of quasar seds can be controlled by varying several model parameters .",
    "each quasar sed is assigned a double power - law continuum , whose average red slope at a longer wavelength than ly@xmath16 is @xmath84 with a standard deviation of @xmath85 @xcite , while the blue slope is @xmath86 and @xmath87 @xcite . to the continuum , we added major emission lines , whose rest equivalent width ew@xmath88 is larger than 5   in @xcite .",
    "the average ew@xmath88 and standard deviation of ly@xmath16 emission were set to @xmath89 ew@xmath90  and @xmath91  @xcite .",
    "the fwhm and its line ratio to the ly@xmath16 for each emission line were kept constant following the numbers in @xcite .",
    "we did not include the baldwin ( 1977 ) effect .",
    "finally , we added the continuum depression due to the intergalactic absorption blueward of ly@xmath16 emission following @xcite .",
    "we have carefully selected @xmath11 promising quasar candidates that meet the color selection criteria of ( 1 ) @xmath83 , ( 2 ) @xmath92 , ( 3 ) @xmath93 , ( 4 ) @xmath94 , and ( 5 ) compact stellar objects .",
    "these color selections are reliably a long way from the dwarf star region .",
    "the colors and image shapes of our candidates are exactly as expected for @xmath0 quasars .",
    "all candidates were visually inspected to remove apparent ghosts , diffraction spikes , and spurious objects .",
    "thanks to our deep image combined with many frames , we did not find contamination from cosmic rays , which was a serious problem in the sdss quasar survey .",
    "photometries in @xmath9 and @xmath55 were also taken into account , when available , for distinguishing from dwarf stars and nearby emission - line galaxies .",
    "the @xmath95-band photometry is available in the vimos field by cfhtls and is also useful to discriminate from transient objects , such as supernovae , that happened to increase their luminosities during our observation epoch , though it is slightly shallower ( @xmath96 ) than our @xmath36 image .",
    "finally , we identified @xmath11 quasar candidates .",
    "figure  [ fig_2col ] shows that this color selection effectively isolates quasars at @xmath97 from m / l / t dwarfs down to @xmath98 , which is 3.5 mag deeper than sdss .",

    "the qlf , @xmath234 , is usually approximated by a double power - law :    @xmath235    where @xmath16 is the faint - end slope , @xmath236 is the bright - end slope , and @xmath237 is the knee luminosity at which the slope of the qlf changes .",
    "we follow other studies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) in adopting @xmath238 , which is the evolution parameter derived from the bright end of the qlf from @xmath239 to @xmath240 @xcite .",

    "we summarize the best - fit ( @xmath16 , @xmath237 ) parameters in table  [ tab_qlf ] for four cases : ( 1 ) sdss+cfhqs+this study assuming only one quasar detection , ( 2 ) sdss+cfhqs+this study assuming two quasar detections , ( 3 ) sdss+cfhqs ( @xmath242 ) with the faintest bin replaced with two detections in cfhqs+this study , and ( 4 ) sdss+cfhqs ( @xmath242 ) with the faintest bin replaced with three detections in cfhqs+this study .",

    "these two parameters are correlated with each other .",
    "@xmath237 tends to become brighter as @xmath16 becomes steeper when fixing the bright - end slope @xcite .",
    "our results from all four cases suggest a steep faint - end slope @xmath248 , which is steeper than the local value @xmath244 . whereas , the knee luminosity @xmath237 , which is in the range of the bright magnitude @xmath249 , can be strongly constrained by precise measurements of the bright part of the qlf at @xmath0 by further observations . in case",
    "( 4 ) , @xmath237 becomes brighter than @xmath250 , and @xmath16 becomes very steep close to @xmath251 , suggesting that the qlf is no longer approximated by a double power law and instead could be almost represented by a single power law .",
    "it should be noted that the qlf at @xmath0 is still not strongly constrained because wide differences in @xmath16 and @xmath237 , as can be seen in figure  [ fig_qlf_err ] , were derived from cases 1 - 4 , whose sample difference is very small . the faint - end slope of qlf at @xmath252 has been found to be @xmath244 @xcite , while a steeper value @xmath253@xmath254 is more likely at a higher redshift @xcite , though uncertainties are large .",

    "it should be noted that we still have @xmath267 quasar candidates without follow - up spectroscopy . in that sense , the current estimate of the qlf faintest bin might be the lower limit .",
    "further observation of these targets is required to put stronger constraints on the faint - end slope .",
    "the candidate list could contain either real quasars or an intermediate population between quasar and galaxy , such as elais109100446 .",
    "otherwise , they could be contaminants of m / l / t - dwarf stars , which are either the faintest at the low - mass end of the stellar mass function or the most distant brown dwarfs detected by our deep and wide survey .",
    "if they were only detected in the @xmath36 and @xmath39 bands , such as elais914002066 , they may be transient objects .",
    "the follow - up spectroscopy was preferentially carried out for the most likely candidates , evaluated based on brightness in @xmath36 and nir colors , and two - thirds of them were found not to be apparent quasars , suggesting that most of the rest were also not .",

    "the large clump of candidates with ( @xmath4 ) @xmath268 to @xmath269 , in which three out of four nd objects are included , were close to the stellar locus and could be scattered dwarf stars .",
    "lockman14004800 , which was found to be an apparent @xmath133o ii@xmath134 $ ] emitter , also has a relatively red ( @xmath4 ) color of @xmath270 . as for the nd objects , if they were quasars , we could have instantly identified the ly@xmath16 emission and possibly a strong break in continuum , whereas brown dwarfs would have a faint continuum across the full wavelength range .",
    "actually , apparent ly@xmath16 emission was suddenly identified even for the first 20 minute exposure on our two spectroscopically confirmed @xmath0 objects .",
    "we usually moved to the next target once a target was found to have neither an apparent continuum break nor emission after 1.5 hr integration .",
    "such an observational strategy would make it difficult to identify a possible faint continua from dwarf stars or line - less quasars @xcite .",
    "many candidates of faint @xmath0 quasars are still waiting for spectroscopy .",
    "although the faintness of our sample prevents us from vigorously executing follow - up spectroscopy , more strong constraints on the faint - end qlf at @xmath0 would be important to constrain the bh evolution models .",
    "it is quite important to observationally determine the faint - end slope of qlf at high @xmath19 , as several bh evolution models make qualitatively different predictions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "faint quasars , which trace smbhs with a lower mass of @xmath271 , are presumed to be in an early stage of smbh growth .",
    "almost all bright quasars at @xmath240 are found to be accreting at approximately the eddington limit @xcite ; however , the current bh mass measurements at @xmath240 are limited by @xmath272 assuming the eddington accretion ( @xmath273 ) , our faint quasar , vimos2911001793 , with @xmath13 corresponding to @xmath274w , would have a bh mass of @xmath275 .",
    "this is close to the bh mass , at which the highest @xmath276 is predicted @xcite .",
    "it is determined by the balance between the gas density available for fueling bh growth and the effective shock heating feedback from agns in the early universe .",
    "direct detection of mg ii emission from faint quasars is required to derive an accurate estimate of their bh masses and eddington ratios @xcite .",
    "it would be difficult to detect the mg ii emission , whose fwhm might be as narrow as @xmath277 km s@xmath18 according to the tight relation between fwhm and @xmath278 of @xmath0 quasars , from the object ; however , it is interesting to assess whether the systematic high-@xmath273 trend found in luminous quasars is also valid for low - luminous quasars to directly address the growth of bhs at early times . @xcite",
    "predict the qlf over @xmath279 from the growth of the bh mass function combined with the halo mass and duty circle inferred from quasar clustering measurements @xcite .",
    "this qlf model is consistent with observations even at @xmath240 ; however , it overpredicts the faint end of the qlf below @xmath280 erg s@xmath18 , which corresponds to @xmath281 .",
    "this may be due to the assumption of a constant eddington ratio and radiative efficiency over a wide luminosity range @xcite .",
    "the higher amplitude of the faint - end qlf inferred from this study would relax the discrepancy , and future nir spectroscopy to directly measure the @xmath276 for the faint quasars will help to revise the model .",
    "the derived qlf at @xmath0 is also interesting in terms of the estimate of the quasar contribution to the photon budget of cosmic reionization .",
    "although quasars are expected to be the main contributor at the bright end of the luminosity function of ionizing sources , the quasar population alone can not account for the entire requirement of ionizing photons @xcite .",
    "our finding in this study of possible steepening of the qlf faint - end slope implies a greater contribution to the photon budget than in the previous estimates .",
    "the emission rate of the hydrogen ionizing photon , @xmath282 s@xmath18 mpc@xmath230 , was evaluated based on @xcite . here , we consider the comoving quasar emissivity at the lyman limit , @xmath283 erg s@xmath18 hz@xmath18 mpc@xmath230 , which is directly related to the change in the qlf , and follow the same assumptions with bh07 on the spectral index at @xmath284  ( @xmath285 ) , the escape fraction of ionizing photon ( @xmath286 ) , the quasar spectral energy distribution , and the frequency dependence of the photoionization cross - section .",
    "the ionizing photon density was found to be @xmath287 s@xmath18 mpc@xmath230 and @xmath288 s@xmath18 mpc@xmath230 in our qlf estimate for case(1 ) and case(4 ) , respectively . the estimate is a factor of approximately two higher than the @xcite , which is attributed to a steeper faint - end slope .",
    "the emissivity also depends on the minimum quasar luminosity , @xmath289 .",
    "we assume @xmath290 in the above calculation .",
    "although it is not clear how a faint agn population would exist , if we integrate the qlf to @xmath291 , @xmath282 changes to @xmath292 s@xmath18 mpc@xmath230 and @xmath293 s@xmath18 mpc@xmath230 for cases ( 1 ) and ( 4 ) , respectively .",
    "the steepening of the qlf faint - end slope increases the expected contribution of quasars to the photon budget of reionization ; however , it only changes by a factor of approximately two to six based on our current qlf estimate .",
    "the estimate was found to be still insufficient for the required photon rate density to keep the balance with the hydrogen recombination of @xmath294 s@xmath18 mpc@xmath230 , assuming the igm clumping factor @xmath295 .",
    "the quasar contribution to the required photon budget is @xmath296 . on the other hand , star - forming galaxies , which are more dominant than quasars at the limiting magnitude of @xmath291 , such as lbgs @xcite and laes @xcite ,",
    "could sustain the universe fully ionized at @xmath240 if the escape fraction of ionizing photons is larger than 0.3 .    in the earlier universe , bhs in the center of each galaxy",
    "are not well matured .",
    "such relatively less massive bhs will produce intense and hard fuv / euv emission compared with usual quasars ; thus , these mini - quasars may have contributed uv background radiation @xcite .",
    "the slope in the euv band plays an important role in indicating the extent to which euv photons penetrate into primordial gas clouds against self - shielding ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the constraints from the soft x - ray background could decline this possibility ( @xcite , but see the discussion in @xcite ) . this deep observation to probe to the faint end of the qlf will make a stronger constraint on the photon budget at @xmath0 .",
    "we have carried out an extremely faint @xmath0 quasar survey with subaru / suprime - cam for @xmath1 deg@xmath34 in total for three ukidss - dxs fields .",
    "our results are summarized as follows .",
    "the quasar selection was made in ( @xmath3 ) and ( @xmath4 ) colors , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are bandpasses with central wavelengths of @xmath7  and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the color selection can effectively isolate quasars at @xmath0 from m / l / t dwarfs even without the @xmath9 band down to @xmath10 , which is 3.5 mag deeper than sdss .",
    "we selected @xmath11 promising quasar candidates from the survey area , and the follow - up spectroscopy identified two objects that had a strong continuum break at @xmath126  and prominent asymmetric ly@xmath16 emission .",
    "the vimos2911001793 has an apparent quasar spectral signature of broad ly@xmath16 emission with hwhm@xmath190=@xmath191 km s@xmath18 and n v@xmath192 emission at @xmath193 .",
    "it is at @xmath14 , and its @xmath39 magnitude gives @xmath13 .",

    "the object has signatures of neither n v@xmath192 nor si iv+o iv emissions .",
    "the absolute magnitude ( @xmath15 ) and hwhm@xmath190 of this object are marginal between faint quasars and bright galaxies .",
    "the object is not resolved under the @xmath203 seeing size .",
    "the object is likely to be a quasar ; however , we can not obtain any conclusive evidence , and the following discussion examines two cases ; our spectroscopic confirmed quasar sample is either one or two .",
    "we derived the qlf at @xmath0 by combining our faint quasar sample with the bright quasar sample by sdss and cfhqs .",
    "although our qlf estimate at @xmath298 is consistent with the previous study , including our data points invokes a higher number density at the faintest bin of the qlf than the previous estimate , making a steeper @xmath16 and brighter @xmath237 .",
    "the steepening of the qlf at the faint end increases the expected emission rate of ionizing photons ; however , it only changes by a factor of approximately two to six , which was found to be still insufficient for the required photon budget of reionization .    0.5 cm we could not conclude whether elais109100446 is a quasar or a galaxy from the current observations .",
    "although it is challenging , follow - up nir spectroscopy for other broad emission lines , such as c iv , c iii and mg ii , would draw more direct evidence of agns , distinguishing them from lbgs .",
    "more importantly , the line width of mg ii of our low - luminosity quasar sample will provide bh mass measurements toward a lower mass .",
    "this will help us to understand the growing - up phase of smbhs in the early universe .",
    "follow - up nir spectroscopy will also determine chemical abundances in the broad - line regions of quasars .",
    "low - luminosity quasars sometimes show different features from bright quasars , such as prominent n iv@xmath134\\lambda1486 $ ] emission @xcite or broad n v @xmath192 emission @xcite .",
    "it is surprising that the @xmath42 quasar spectrum has a strikingly good fit to that of low @xmath19 @xcite , suggesting that this is not yet the first quasar .",
    "our faint quasar sample would host smbhs with lower masses , and its chemical abundance is interesting in the context of the initial star formation history and smbh evolution .",
    "the submillimeter and radio follow - up observations will detect co emission even from @xmath0 quasars @xcite , thereby revealing their dynamical masses and velocity structure .",
    "follow - up deep imaging will enable us to reveal galaxy clustering around the quasar , which has been used as a useful probe of possible sites of galaxy overdensity at high @xmath19 , providing an intriguing clue to the nature of the first sites of co - evolution of quasars and galaxies and possible different star formation histories in high - density environments @xcite .",
    "finally , this observation is a good precursor study of the forthcoming hyper suprime - cam ( hsc ) survey on the subaru telescope .",
    "the hsc survey consists of three - layer ( wide : 1400deg@xmath34 , @xmath299 ; deep : 27deg@xmath34 , @xmath300 ; ultradeep : 3.5deg@xmath34 , @xmath301 ) , multi - band imaging surveys in which @xmath302-band , whose bandpass is close to the @xmath39 band in this study , imaging is planned .",
    "the expected limiting magnitude on the wide layer is @xmath303 , which is slightly deeper than this study .",
    "it also helps to effectively select quasars at @xmath0 as well as @xmath304 .",
    "the expected number of quasars is @xmath305 down to @xmath306 and @xmath307 down to @xmath308 at @xmath0 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "we expect that hsc high-@xmath19 quasar survey will overcome current technical difficulties by combining a large telescope , a wide - field imaging camera ( @xmath309 deg@xmath34 ) , and an effective selection technique to systematically trace the qlf evolution beyond the knee up to @xmath42 .",

    "<S> invokes a higher number density in the faintest bin of the quasar luminosity function than the previous estimate employed . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests a steeper faint - end slope than lower @xmath19 , though it is yet uncertain based on a small number of spectroscopically identified faint quasars and several quasar candidates are still remain to be diagnosed . </S>",
    "<S> the steepening of the quasar luminosity function at the faint end does increase the expected emission rate of the ionizing photon ; however , it only changes by a factor of approximately two to six . </S>",
    "<S> this was found to be still insufficient for the required photon budget of reionization at @xmath0 . </S>"
