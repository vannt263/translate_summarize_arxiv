    "bl lacertae objects ( bl lacs ) are set apart from other types of active galactic nuclei by their extreme properties , namely , irregular , rapid variability , strong optical and radio polarization , core - dominant radio morphology , and a broad continuum extending from the radio through the @xmath2-rays .",
    "these properties are believed to be due to the fact that bl lacs are low - luminosity radio galaxies ( fanaroff - riley type i [ fr i ] ; fanaroff & riley 1974 ) whose jets are aligned close to the observer s line of sight ( first proposed by blandford & rees 1978 ) . at such small viewing angles , relativistic effects cause the jet s luminosity to appear amplified , and therefore we refer to bl lacs as `` beamed '' fr i radio galaxies .    the classification of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) as a bl lac has been controversial ever since the first surveys which included a sizeable number of these objects , and has somewhat varied over time .",
    "two of the early surveys to select a large number of bl lacs were the 1 jy in the radio ( stickel et al .",
    "1991 ; rector & stocke 2001 ) and the _ einstein _ medium sensitivity survey ( emss ) in the x - ray band ( stocke et al .",
    "1991 ; morris et al .",
    "the 1 jy radio survey used two criteria to classify an object as a bl lac : a flat radio spectrum ( @xmath3 , where @xmath4 ) and an optical spectrum with emission lines weaker than 5    rest - frame equivalent width .",
    "this latter criterion was chosen to separate bl lacs from their more powerful siblings , the flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) .",
    "other bl lac properties , such as strong polarization and rapid variability , were not regarded as necessary requirements .",
    "nevertheless , optical polarization studies , available at the time , gave values above 3% for almost all objects ( khr & schmidt 1990 ) , and their strong and irregular variability was quantified later by heidt & wagner ( 1996 ) .",
    "the emss x - ray survey , on the other hand , did not use any radio information to classify its objects ( allowing for the existence of radio - quiet x - ray emitting bl lacs , which could not be found ) , but introduced a limit on the ca h&k break value as an additional criterion . the ca h&k break , also referred to as `` ca ii break '' or `` contrast '' , is a stellar absorption feature typically found in the spectra of elliptical galaxies .",
    "its value in non - active elliptical galaxies is on average @xmath5 ( dressler & shectman 1987 ) .",
    "stocke et al .",
    "( 1991 ) chose a limiting value of 25% for the emss bl lacs in order to ensure the presence of a substantial non - thermal jet continuum in addition to the thermal spectrum of the host galaxy . as regards polarization ( stocke et al .",
    "1991 ; see also jannuzi et al .",
    "1994 ) and variability ( heidt & wagner 1998 ) data , emss bl lacs were found to have somewhat lower values than the ones typical of 1 jy bl lacs .",
    "however , similarly to the 1 jy survey , these two bl lac properties were not used as part of the classification scheme .    the two defining criteria for a bl lac used by the emss , a diluted ca h&k break and no or very weak emission lines in the optical spectrum , were revised by march et al . ( 1996 ) .",
    "in order to additionally include in surveys radio sources with a strong host galaxy contribution which might hide weak bl lacs , these authors proposed to expand the limit on the ca h&k break up to a value of 40% and accordingly , due to a lower continuum in these objects , the allowed rest frame equivalent width of the strongest emission line up to a value of @xmath650   .",
    "in fact , they suggested a triangular region in the contrast , equivalent width plane ( see their fig .",
    "6 ) to be used to separate bl lacs both from radio galaxies and quasars .",
    "bl lacs selected according to these extended criteria were termed `` bl lac candidates '' , in order to distinguish them from those fulfilling the classical criteria .",
    "recent surveys , like rgb ( laurent - muehleisen et al .",
    "1998 ) , dxrbs ( perlman et al . 1998 ; landt et al . 2001 ) , the sedentary survey ( giommi , menna & padovani 1999 ) , and rex ( caccianiga et al .",
    "1999 , 2000 ) , employ this revised version of the bl lac classification .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate why bl lacs have lower ca h&k break values than low - power radio galaxies . in section 2 , we relate the ca h&k break value to optical jet power . in section 3 ,",
    "we expand our studies to the radio and x - ray band . in section 4",
    ", we determine a possible relation between ca h&k break value and viewing angle .",
    "an application of our studies to the two bl lac subclasses , low- and high - energy peaked bl lacs , is presented in section 5 .",
    "finally , in section 6 , we discuss our results and present our conclusions . throughout this paper",
    ", we assumed the following cosmological parameters , @xmath7 km / s / mpc and @xmath8 .",
    "according to current unified schemes for radio - loud agn , bl lacs are beamed fr i radio galaxies . therefore ,",
    "in their optical spectra we see the amplified non - thermal emission from the jet in addition to thermal emission from the underlying host galaxy , normally a luminous elliptical ( e.g. , wurtz , stocke & yee 1996 ) .",
    "the non - thermal and thermal components have different shapes , and their relative strengths determine the observed bl lac continuum .",
    "the jet component can be locally best described by a single power law of the form @xmath9 ( or equivalently @xmath10 , where @xmath11 ) .",
    "the spectrum of the host galaxy , on the other hand , has an approximate black body shape and contains absorption features typical of ellipticals .    for our studies we have simulated possible bl lac continua . for this purpose",
    ", we assumed the jet overlaying the elliptical host galaxy to vary in intensity and optical spectral slope .",
    "we used values between 0.2 and 100 for the jet / galaxy ratio ( defined at 5500  ) , and assumed for the optical spectral slope the three cases @xmath12 , following the results of falomo , scarpa & bersanelli ( 1994 ) , and included additionally the extreme case of @xmath13 .",
    "1 shows the resulting simulated bl lac spectra representatively for a jet of optical spectral slope @xmath14 .",
    "as the jet steadily increases relative to the galaxy , two effects are visible .",
    "the shape of the bl lac continuum resembles more and more a power - law spectrum and the galactic absorption features become weaker .",
    "one prominent absorption feature typically seen in the spectra of elliptical galaxies is the ca h&k break located at @xmath6 4000     rest frame wavelength .",
    "this feature , also referred to as `` ca ii break '' or `` contrast '' , is defined as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the fluxes in the rest frame wavelength regions @xmath18    and @xmath19    respectively . its value in normal non - active elliptical galaxies is found to be on average @xmath6 0.5 ( dressler & shectman 1987 ) . in bl lacs , the value of the ca h&k break is decreased by the non - thermal jet emission .",
    "we note that the ca h&k break value is related to the discontinuity at 4000    [ d(4000 ) ; bruzual 1983 ] by @xmath20 , and is measured in spectra plotted as @xmath21 versus @xmath22 .",
    "however , if measured in spectra plotted as @xmath23 versus @xmath24 , the relation @xmath25 can be used to convert one to the other .    in order to quantify how the amplified jet emission changes the ca h&k break value , we measured this feature in each of our simulated spectra . in the case where the jet dominates the object s spectrum ,",
    "we set the ca h&k break value equal to zero ( its minimum possible value in our simulations ) . for every case of @xmath26",
    ", we get that there is a significant ( @xmath27 ) linear anti - correlation between the assumed jet / galaxy ratio and the ca h&k break value ( dotted lines in fig .",
    "2 ) .    to assess how well this result is reproduced by observations we need information on ca h&k break value and jet / galaxy ratios for a sizeable sample of bl lacs .",
    "observational jet / galaxy ratios were obtained from the imaging studies of urry et al .",
    "( 2000 ) which allow the separation of the core flux from that of the host galaxy .",
    "these authors used the hst wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc 2 ) to image in snapshot mode a sample of 132 bl lacs from different radio and x - ray surveys .",
    "most of their images were taken in the f702w filter ( similar to cousin r filter ) , but those already observed in f814w during an earlier hst cycle were reobserved in f606w ( a filter similar to johnson v ) .",
    "we derived jet / galaxy ratios at 5500   by converting @xmath28 magnitudes to @xmath29 magnitudes .",
    "we assumed @xmath30 for the core component ( urry et al .",
    "2000 ) , while for the host galaxy magnitudes we used the redshift - dependent @xmath31 values as tabulated by urry et al .",
    "( 2000 ; see their table 2 ) .",
    "ca h&k break values for 48 of these sources were derived from the literature and also from our own measurements ( see sect .",
    "3 ) .    for these bl lacs",
    ", we plot in fig .",
    "2 the jet / galaxy ratio vs. ca h&k break value .",
    "an analysis using the asurv package ( feigelson & nelson 1985 ) , that allows us to include upper limits , shows that these two quantities are significantly ( @xmath27 ) anti - correlated , in agreement with our simulations .",
    "furthermore , a partial correlation analysis shows that this correlation is not induced by a common redshift dependence . in fig .",
    "2 we plot the observed correlation between optical jet / galaxy ratio and ca h&k break value ( solid line ) in addition to the correlations obtained from our simulations ( dotted lines ) .",
    "a comparison between the two indicates that the scatter in the observed correlation ( @xmath32 ) is likely induced by jets of different optical spectral slopes .",
    "we have shown using both simulations and observational data that the ca h&k break value in bl lacs anti - correlates with optical jet / galaxy ratio . at this point",
    "the question arises if this correlation could possibly mask a correlation between jet emission and ca h&k break value or between host galaxy emission and ca h&k break value .",
    "urry et al .",
    "( 2000 ) find that the distribution of the absolute magnitudes of bl lac host galaxies has a relatively small dispersion @xmath33 mag .",
    "this result is based on detected host galaxies of a very large number of bl lacs ( 72 sources ) covering the redshift range @xmath34 . the relatively small dispersion found by urry et al .",
    "( 2000 ) implies that the luminosity of bl lac host galaxies can be regarded as roughly constant .",
    "therefore , the observed increase in jet / galaxy ratio ( with decreasing ca h&k break ) can be related directly to an increase in jet power . indeed , for our sample of objects we find that , on one hand , the optical core luminosity ( from urry et al .",
    "2000 ) is significantly ( @xmath35 ) anti - correlated with the ca h&k break value ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , and that , on the other hand , no significant ( @xmath36 ) correlation is present between host galaxy luminosity and ca h&k break value .",
    "* table 1 . * bl lacs and fr i radio galaxies +    [ cols=\"<,<,<,>,^,^,>,^,^,^,^ , > , > , > \" , ]     @xmath37 luminosities in units of [ w / hz ]    our use of the ca h&k break value allows us to evaluate and compare for the first time the radio and x - ray luminosities of lbl and hbl at different orientations . in table 3",
    "we list the x - ray and radio core powers resulting from the correlations in fig . 9 and 10 for lbl and hbl at small ( @xmath38 ) and large ( @xmath39 )",
    "ca h&k break values and therefore viewing angles . from this",
    "we get that at large viewing angles lbl and hbl have similar radio core and x - ray powers , i.e. , they reside in fr i radio galaxies with similar properties ( radio core and x - ray luminosities ) , while at relatively small viewing angles the two bl lac subclasses differ significantly in their luminosities . in this case",
    "we get that lbl are @xmath40 times more luminous in the radio and by a similar factor less luminous in the x - ray band than hbl .",
    "we stress that the objects used in this work form an heterogeneous sample of sources from different surveys with widely different flux limits . therefore , although we believe that these luminosity differences are present , their precise values might depend on the selected objects . in the following we want to expand on the influence of selection effects on the luminosity differences between lbl and hbl .    for this purpose",
    "we have also included bl lacs with extended radio powers more typical of fr ii radio galaxies ( @xmath41 w / hz ) .",
    "furthermore , we distinguished between the following three cases : 1 . a comparison between hbl ( 65 objects ) and lbl ( 18 objects ) , where both have extended radio emissions typical of fr",
    "i radio galaxies ; 2 .",
    "a comparison between hbl ( 65 objects ) and lbl ( 25 objects ) , where the latter are selected independent of extended radio emission ; 3 . a comparison between hbl ( 65 objects ) and lbl ( 7 objects ) , where the latter have extended radio emissions typical of fr ii radio galaxies .",
    "the most important difference between these three cases is that we compare hbl and lbl that are first matched and then not matched in extended radio power , i.e. , have a similar parent population .",
    "for the three cases , we obtain the following results , illustrated in table 4 :    \\1 . in the first case , where we compare lbl and hbl with similar extended radio powers",
    ", we get that they have similar mean radio core luminosities , while hbl have higher mean x - ray luminosities than lbl . in this case , we get that lbl have a significantly lower mean redshift than hbl .    \\2 . in the second case , where we compare lbl and hbl with somewhat different extended radio powers , we get that lbl have higher mean radio core luminosities and lower mean x - ray luminosities than hbl . in this case ,",
    "lbl and hbl have similar mean redshifts .    \\3 . in the third case , where we compare lbl with high extended radio powers and hbl with low extended radio powers",
    ", we get that the two bl lac subclasses have similar mean x - ray luminosities , while lbl have higher mean radio core luminosities than hbl . in this case , lbl have a significantly higher mean redshift than hbl .",
    "these comparisons show that the resulting luminosity differences between lbl and hbl seem to depend strongly on the samples chosen .",
    "in particular , our three cases illustrate that , the more lbl and hbl differ in their extended radio powers , the less they differ in their x - ray powers .",
    "we note that these luminosity differences can not be due only to a redshift effect .",
    "if that were the case , in fact , higher - redshift samples would be more luminous in all bands , contrary to what observed .",
    "we can further illustrate these selection effects by using two different samples : the sample of maraschi et al .",
    "( 1986 ) that contains lbl and hbl with similar x - ray powers , and the complete sample of bl lacs from the dxrbs which is radio - flux limited and therefore contains lbl and hbl with similar radio powers",
    ". nearly half of the objects in the sample used by maraschi et al .",
    "( 1986 ) are strong - lined objects , i.e. , radio quasars .",
    "therefore , in order to compare their results with ours we selected from their sample only the bl lac objects . similarly to their results for radio- and x - ray - selected blazars",
    ", we get that their lbl ( 17 objects ) and hbl ( 11 objects ) have similar mean x - ray powers , but significantly different ( @xmath35 ) mean ( total ) radio luminosities @xmath42 and @xmath43 w / hz respectively .",
    "the mean redshifts are @xmath44 and @xmath45 for lbl and hbl respectively , different at the 98.8% level .",
    "this result is similar to our case 3 , indicating that these authors have compared radio - strong lbl with radio - weak hbl .    for the sample of dxrbs bl lacs",
    ", we get that lbl ( 20 objects ) and hbl ( 12 objects ) have similar mean radio powers , but significantly different ( @xmath46 ) mean x - ray powers @xmath47 and @xmath48 w / hz respectively . in this case",
    "lbl and hbl have similar mean redshifts .",
    "this result shows that our first case can be reproduced with a radio - flux limited sample .",
    "now the question arises : `` which is the best approach to clarify what are the intrinsic luminosity differences between lbl and hbl in a given band ? '' .",
    "we think that this can be answered in a physically meaningful way by comparing lbl and hbl with a similar parent population , i.e. , with similar extended radio powers . ideally ,",
    "if information on the ca h&k break value is available , one should also take into account orientation effects by separating sources according to viewing angle .",
    "we have suggested that the ca h&k break value of bl lacs and fr i radio galaxies is a direct indicator of viewing angle .",
    "we have based this on the strong anti - correlation between ca h&k break value and optical , radio , x - ray jet luminosity , and radio core dominance parameter .",
    "we have excluded the possibility that the observed range in radio jet power is intrinsic and not due to orientation , since we could not find a similarly strong correlation between ca h&k break value and extended radio emission for our sample of objects .",
    "stocke et al .",
    "( 1991 ) introduced a limit of 25% on the allowed ca h&k break value for bl lacs , which was later expanded by march et al .",
    "( 1996 ) up to a value of 40% , in connection with the strength of observed emission lines .",
    "our result implies that those bl lacs with ca h&k break values @xmath49 , termed by march et al .",
    "( 1996 ) `` bl lac candidates '' , represent in fact the long - sought population of objects with viewing angles intermediate between the `` classical '' bl lacs and fr i radio galaxies .",
    "which limit on the ca h&k break value should be chosen to separate bl lacs from fr i radio galaxies ? in general , bl lacs are those objects viewed at angles smaller than a certain critical angle , which has been defined in the literature as the angle for which the radio core dominance parameter is equal to 1 ( urry & padovani 1995 ) . from the correlation between the radio core dominance parameter and ca h&k break value illustrated in fig .",
    "6 we infer that a ca h&k break value @xmath50 would then be appropriate to separate bl lacs ( core - dominated ) from radio galaxies ( lobe - dominated ) .",
    "we note that this value is very close to @xmath51 , proposed by march et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "we have shown that the ca h&k break value is a suitable indicator of orientation .",
    "so far , only one other such indicator was known : the radio core dominance parameter .",
    "however , the determination of this quantity usually requires dedicated radio observations , which are time consuming and not always available .",
    "therefore , our result that we can constrain the viewing angle of a bl lac or fr i radio galaxy from such a common astrophysical observation as its optical spectrum will be a considerable advantage in our studies of unified schemes .",
    "we have shown for our full sample that radio and x - ray jets of bl lacs and fr i radio galaxies have similar lorentz factors and are viewed under similar angles , namely the radio and x - ray doppler factors are the same ( within the errors ) .",
    "this result becomes even more significant if we separate our sample into low- ( lbl ) and high - energy peaked bl lacs ( hbl ) .",
    "we have also shown that lbl and hbl have jets with similar lorentz factors , viewed under similar angles , i.e. , their doppler factors are similar .",
    "this result is in agreement with the `` different peak energy '' scenario ( padovani & giommi 1995 ) , which claims that the only difference between lbl and hbl is the frequency position of their synchrotron emission peak .",
    "however , we note that there is a hint in our data that lbl might be more beamed than hbl , i.e. , they might have either larger lorentz factors or span a larger range in viewing angles . but given that our sample is heterogeneous , this might be induced by selection effects .",
    "our finding that the ca h&k break value is directly related to viewing angle has allowed us to compare for the first time the luminosities of the two types of bl lacs at different orientations .",
    "we derive that fr i radio galaxies harbouring lbl and hbl have similar radio core and x - ray luminosities . at small viewing angles ,",
    "lbl have radio cores @xmath40 times more powerful than hbl ones , while the opposite is true in the x - ray band .",
    "these two results combined appear to be at odds with our previous result that lbl and hbl have similar doppler factors .",
    "we attribute this apparent contradiction to small number statistics .",
    "note in fact that hbl - like and lbl - like also differ in their powers in the same sense as hbl and lbl but their differences are not significant due to the larger errors at @xmath52 .",
    "we have also discussed the issue of selection effects on the study of luminosity differences between hbl and lbl , and have shown that the comparison to be meaningful has to be done for samples with similar parent populations , i.e. , similar extended radio powers .    to summarize , we have reached the following conclusions :    1 .   the value of the ca h&k break in bl lacs and fr i radio galaxies decreases with increasing jet power .",
    "the increase in jet power is caused by a change in viewing angle .",
    "bl lacs with ca h&k break values @xmath49 , termed by march et al . (",
    "1996 ) `` bl lac candidates '' , are the long - sought population with viewing angles intermediate between the `` classical '' bl lacs and fr i radio galaxies . 4 .",
    "bl lacs and fr i radio galaxies have radio and x - ray jets with similar lorentz factors ( @xmath53 ) , and viewed under similar angles , i.e. , their jets have similar radio and x - ray doppler factors .",
    "the two types of bl lacs , lbl and hbl , have jets with similar lorentz factors , which are viewed under similar angles , i.e. , they are affected by beaming in a similar way .",
    "lbl and hbl reside in fr i radio galaxies with similar radio core and x - ray powers .",
    "however , at small viewing angles , lbl have radio cores @xmath40 times more powerful than hbl ones , while the opposite is true in the x - ray band .",
    "in future work we plan to investigate the emission line properties of bl lacs in order to understand in what way they are related to their more powerful siblings , the flat spectrum radio quasars . with this",
    "we hope to be able to give a more complete picture of what a bl lac really is .",
    "we would like to thank eric perlman , manfred stickel , and clive tadhunter for providing several spectra in electronic format .",
