    "three - flavor full qcd simulation is a current crucial task of lattice qcd , as it would enable us , for the first time , to study hadron physics based on principles of qcd with no approximations . to achieve this",
    ", the cp - pacs and jlqcd collaborations are carrying out simulations with dynamical degenerate u , d quarks and a s quark with different quark mass .    in our previous work",
    "presented at lattice 2003 , we made a exploratory study at a lattice spacing @xmath2  fm on a small lattice @xmath3 @xcite . in this article",
    "we report the new results for the light meson spectrum and quark masses on a larger lattice of @xmath1 at @xmath2 fm .",
    "we note that the analysis procedures have been made more systematic over these adopted at the time of lattice 2004 , and results are , albeit qualitatively the same , numerically different .",
    "we employ the rg - improved gauge action and the non - perturbatively @xmath0 improved wilson quark action determined for this gauge action @xcite , and plan to perform simulations at three lattice spacings , @xmath4 fm , @xmath5 fm , and @xmath6 fm , which are at even intervals in @xmath7 , with a fixed physical volume @xmath8 .",
    "we take five u , d quark masses for chiral extrapolations in the range of @xmath9 , and two s quark masses around @xmath10 for interpolations .",
    "these parameters are chosen from our experience of simulations at @xmath2 fm on a @xmath3 lattice .",
    "an estimate of computational resources available to this project , including the earth simulator , and performance of the polynomial hybrid monte carlo program @xcite we use indicates that we can accumulate at least @xmath11 trajectories at @xmath12 fm and @xmath6 fm and @xmath13 trajectories at @xmath14 fm , within two to three years , of which we are in the second year .",
    "@xmath15    in this project , our first interest is the meson spectrum and light quark masses , because our physical volume @xmath16 is not sufficiently large for baryons .",
    "among three lattice spacings , calculations at @xmath12 fm have been completed by simulations carried out at @xmath17 with @xmath18 on a @xmath1 lattice . in tab . [",

    "meson masses are calculated for light - light ( ll ) , light - strange ( ls ) and strange - strange ( ss ) combinations of valence quark masses , and are given in the table .",
    "they are determined by a single hyperbolic - cosine correlated fit with @xmath21 .",
    "masses are stable against a variation of @xmath22 .",
    "chiral fits are made to ll , ls and ss masses simultaneously ignoring correlations among these masses .",
    "we adopt polynomial functions in quark masses up to quadratic terms .",
    "@xmath23 ( @xmath24 for ps and @xmath25 for v ) is acceptable .",
    "we also test the fits using masses normalized by sommer scale and find that the meson spectrum and quark masses are stable against the change .",
    "the physical point is determined from experimental values of @xmath26 ( k - input ) or @xmath27 ( @xmath28-input ) .",
    "the inverse of the lattice spacing @xmath29 gev is independent of inputs for the s quark mass .",

    "we find that quark masses in @xmath34 qcd are smaller than those in @xmath31 and @xmath32 qcd . since the non - perturbatively improved clover coefficient is used , we speculate that the values of quark masses at this lattice spacing do not change sizably in the continuum limit .    fm . ]    fm . ]",
    "as far as we compare the spectrum and quark masses at @xmath33 fm , we observe the difference between @xmath34 and @xmath39 . at this stage we can not conclude whether this effect is due to dynamical strange quark or non - perturbatively determined @xmath40 .",
