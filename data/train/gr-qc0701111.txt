    "theories of @xmath0 gravity as an explanation of the dark energy problem have attracted much recent attention .",
    "these theories are of particular interest since @xmath0 modifications to general relativity ( gr ) appear naturally in the low - energy effective actions of the quantum gravity and the quantization of fields in curved spacetime .",
    "these theories are also conformally related to gr with a self - interacting scalar field @xcite and both the early time inflation and the late - time acceleration of the universe could be resulted by a single mechanism in such theories . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the specific model in which the correction is a polynomial of @xmath4 and @xmath5 is considered and the analysis there shows that late - time accelerating attractor solutions exist .",
    "meanwhile , models with @xmath6 corrections are discussed within the palatini approach @xcite , in which the field equations are second order , and similar acceleration solutions are found . the palatini-@xmath0 theory of gravitation",
    "was then tested using various cosmological data such as supernovae ( sn ) , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) shift parameter , baryon oscillation and big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , in @xcite .",
    "recently , constraints from cmb and matter power spectra have also been given in @xcite .",
    "these constraints ( especially that from the matter power spectrum ) successfully exclude most of the parameter space , making the model indistinguishable from the standard @xmath7 in practice .    turning to the metric @xmath0 gravity theories ,",
    "the field equations become fourth order and more difficult to handle @xcite . until now",
    ", much attention has been focused on the solar system tests of the theory and the existing results appear to exclude a viable @xmath0 cosmological model that leads to the current cosmic accelerating expansion ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ; also see @xcite and references therein for arguments against these ) . regardless of these local considerations , however , we can look at the cosmological behavior of the theory in order to arrive at an independent test .",
    "the cosmological constraints on @xmath0 gravity is relevant also because one can simply imagine that the baryons do not see the modifications to gr ( a possibility suggested in @xcite ) evades the solar system tests in a somewhat artificial way ) , or transform to the einstein frame and consider a scalar field model mathematically equivalent to the jordan frame @xmath0 gravity @xcite , but with the scalar field coupling only to the dark matter . for further discussion of the cosmology of the @xmath0 dark energy models",
    "see , for example , @xcite and references therein .    in a recent study , @xcite",
    ", the authors find that the class of friedmann cosmological models arising in a theory with @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( note the difference from their original paper because of our sign convention , @xmath10 ) , which was thought to lead to the late - time acceleration because the correction term to gr becomes significant at late times , can not reproduce the matter - dominated era of conventional cosmology ( yielding @xmath11 rather than @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the scale factor and @xmath14 the cosmic time ) and so will be ruled out by measurements of the redshift distance ( see also @xcite ) . in this work",
    "they do not consider the case of @xmath15 which _ is _ able to give a standard matter - dominated era , as we show below . in a later work , @xcite",
    ", these authors consider the cosmological viabilities of general @xmath0 models and have included this possibility .",
    "since there are few known models with simple forms of @xmath0 having the capability to consistently describing the whole evolutionary history of the universe ( see however @xcite for a discussion on this ) , we will also consider the perturbation evolutions of the model . to this end",
    "we derive the covariant and gauge invariant perturbation equations and put them into the public camb code @xcite in order to obtain the cmb and matter power spectra .",
    "note that the dynamics of perturbations for @xmath0 gravity have also been considered in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the background expansion is fixed to match @xmath16 while in @xcite two specified models are considered which do not give standard matter - dominated eras and the calculation is done in the einstein frame ; thus both analyses differ from the work reported here .",
    "this paper is organised as the following : in section  [ sect : fequations ] we briefly introduce the cosmological model and list the background and perturbation evolution equations that are needed in the numerical calculation . in section  [",
    "sect : numerics ] we solve for the background evolution of the model numerically , and incorporate the perturbations equations into camb in order to calculate the cmb and matter power spectra .",
    "the discussion and conclusions are then presented in section  [ sect : conclusion ] . throughout this work",
    "we will set @xmath17 @xmath18 and only consider the case of a spatially flat universe filled with photons , baryons , cold dark matter ( cdm ) and three species of effectively massless neutrinos .",
    "in this section we very briefly summarise the main ingredients of @xmath0 gravity in metric approach , and list the general perturbation equations that govern the dynamics of small inhomogeneities in this theory .      the starting point for the metric-@xmath0 gravity",
    "is the einstein - hilbert action , @xmath19 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath20 with @xmath21 being the gravitational constant and @xmath22 is the ricci scalar .",
    "varying the action with respect to the metric @xmath23 gives the modified einstein equations @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the trace of eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) reads @xmath27with @xmath28 .",
    "let us call this the structural equation , which relates @xmath29 ( or @xmath30 ) directly to the energy components in the universe .",
    "however , the term @xmath31 enters here which makes the equation a dynamical rather than algebraic one .",
    "recall , in contrast , that in the palatini @xmath0 gravity the metric @xmath23 and connection @xmath32 are treated as independent variables with @xmath33 ; the variation of the action is taken with respect to both of these two variables with the resulting field equations being second order and the structural equation simply an algebraic relation .",
    "now we can also make a conformal transformation , @xmath34from the original jordan frame to the einstein frame ( the tilded quantities are the einstein frame ones from here on ) , in which we obtain the following action for the metric @xmath0 gravity : @xmath35 .\\ \\ \\\\end{aligned}\\]]in eq .",

    "since we implement our measurements in the jordan frame , we shall treat the jordan frame metric @xmath23 as the physical one .",
    "hence the difference between @xmath0 gravity and gr ( @xmath40 ) can be understood as a change in the way that the spacetime curvature , and thus the physical ricci tensor @xmath41 responds to the distribution of matter .",
    "the perturbation equations in general theories of @xmath0 gravity derived in this section which uses the method of @xmath42 decomposition challinor1999 , lewis2000 . for more details , we refer the reader to these references and only briefly outline its main ingredients before listing out results .",
    "the main idea of @xmath42 decomposition is to make spacetime splits of physical quantities with respect to the 4-velocity @xmath43 of an observer .",
    "the projection tensor @xmath44 is defined as @xmath45 which can be used to obtain covariant tensors perpendicular to @xmath46 .",

    "the new minimum of the effective potential , @xmath103 , satisfies @xmath104 . from @xmath105 rightwards ,",
    "the effective potential is dominated by @xmath106 which is essentially a runaway one in this region ; from @xmath107 leftwards , it is dominated by the matter coupling , which increases exponentially as @xmath97 becomes more negative .",
    "thus , this situation has the advantageous properties of a chameleon field @xcite , the cosmology of which has been studied in @xcite .",
    "however , there is one important difference between our case and theirs . in order to see this ,",
    "we show that the effective mass - squared of small oscillations around the potential minimum , @xmath108 , is given by @xmath109when @xmath110 is small enough ( note that @xmath111 ) .",

    "thus , for @xmath118 the ratio @xmath119 always increases with increasing redshift , and , because @xmath120 today , it is much larger than 1 at early times , just as in the standard chameleon scenario .",
    "the differences lies in the fact that , at late times , in the present model @xmath121 for @xmath122 not too close to @xmath123 .",
    "we can now depict the evolution history of the field as follows : at the early times the effective mass of @xmath97 is much heavier than @xmath124 so that the field is attracted towards its effective potential minimum , oscillates around it , but with the amplitude the oscillations being gradually damped so that it eventually tracks the minimum . a similar analysis to the one in ref .",
    "@xcite can be made to show that the field rolls slowly along this attractor .",
    "as the universe evolves , @xmath125 gets smaller so that eventually the field begins to lag behind its effective potential minimum and behaves like a normal quintessence field , which contributes a dynamical dark energy . in the far future , when @xmath126 the dynamics of the field is determined by its potential only , so that it would evolve towards the potential minimum , @xmath127 and stay there , after which the universe commences de sitter expansion in both the einstein and jordan frames .    at this stage",

    "the potential @xmath39 is , however , nonzero according to eq .",

    "finally a comment on the solar system constraints on the @xmath0 models . as discussed by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , when the baryons are allowed to see the @xmath0 modification to gr , the parameter region where one has a dynamical dark energy does not overlap with that in which the chameleon effect could successfully suppress the scalar - tensor type deviation from gr in the solar system @xcite . here , as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sect : intro ] , however , we are merely concerned with employing a `` parametrized post - friedman '' description @xcite of the cosmological effects of the @xmath0 model and assume that these deviations from the standard gravitational model do not affect the baryons .",
    "furthermore , as noticed in @xcite , the exclusion of @xmath0 models using solar system constraints relies on the assumption that the transition from gr - dominated dynamics to scalar - tensor dynamics on these scales occurs adiabatically , which has not been investigated in detail .",
    "the non - uniqueness of the static spherically symmetric solutions to higher - order gravity theories is also a complicating factor when determining the solar system bounds because of the absence of a birkhoff theorem ; see refs .",
    "@xcite for more details .",
    "although we rely on the transformation to einstein frame to obtain a physical picture for the present model , our numerical calculations for the background evolution will be implemented in the jordan frame to be consistent with later perturbation calculations .",
    "we describe these calculations in this section .",
    "following @xcite , we make the following definitions @xmath133where @xmath134 , and , using the fact @xmath135 at the background level , write eqs .",

    "secondly , we see a reduction of power at low @xmath215s , which was also been found and discussed in @xcite , although there the background expansion is fixed to match the @xmath7 cosmology .",
    "this reduction in low-@xmath3 power is caused by a weaker late - time decay of the large - scale potential @xmath216 ( which is the coefficient of the harmonic expansion of @xmath217 as @xmath218 and related to the newtonian potential @xmath219 by @xmath220 for any specified @xmath177-mode where @xmath221 is the anisotropic stress @xcite ) compared with that in @xmath7 , that leads to a suppression on the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect and thus of the @xmath222 at low @xmath3s . in figure  [ fig:6 ] we give some plots for the evolution of the potential at different scales ( @xmath177 s ) in this model , which clearly show the slower decay at large scales @xcite .",
    "note that this is remarkably different from the cases of palatini @xmath0 gravities , in which the potentials decay much more rapidly than that in @xmath223 @xcite , leading to significant amplifications of the low-@xmath3 power .",
    "also , we see that this model is potentially useful in reducing the difference between the predicted and measured cmb  powers at low @xmath3 .     model .",
    "the black , red , green , blue and magenta lines represent the cases of @xmath174 and @xmath146 respectively . in all these plots",
    "we have adopted @xmath224 and @xmath225 . ]    the linear matter power spectra at @xmath226 of the present models are shown in figure  [ fig:7 ] . from this plot",
    "we can see that the matter power spectrum has similar behavior to those in the case of a general @xmath0 model with @xmath227 background evolution @xcite . on small scales the spectra arising in the @xmath0 gravity theories we are considering have similar shapes to the case of the @xmath7 power spectrum , and this fact can be understood roughly , as follows .",
    "consider for simplicity the growth of the dark - matter fractional density perturbation @xmath228 which is defined by @xmath229 ( essentially the @xmath230 in cmbfast ) , in a universe filled with cold dark matter and photons .",
    "after some manipulations of our set of perturbation equations it is easy to show that in metric @xmath0 theories : @xmath231where a prime represents the derivative with the conformal time @xmath232 ( @xmath233 ) and @xmath234 . at the same time , eq .",
    "( [ eq:52 ] ) can now be rewritten as @xmath235where @xmath236 is the harmonic expansion coefficient of @xmath237 ( @xmath238 ) . in the cdm frame ( in which @xmath239 )",
    "we have lewis2000 @xmath240a similar analysis to that below eq .",
    "( [ eq:55 ] ) then shows that , for small scales which are characterised by @xmath241 , the term @xmath242 dominates the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq:57 ] ) provided that latexmath:[$%    later stages in our @xmath0 cosmology .",
    "thus , we have now @xmath244which we have also verified numerically .",
    "substituting eqs .",
    "( [ eq:58 ] , [ eq:59 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq:56 ] ) , we get ( neglecting the contribution from relativistic energy components ) : @xmath245interestingly , we have obtained a scale - independent behavior for the cdm density perturbation growth on small scales , similar to that of standard gr , where it is given by @xmath246this explains why on small scales the shape of the @xmath0 matter power spectrum is like that of @xmath7 ( see @xcite for a similar example ) .",
    "it also indicates that the growths of small - scale perturbations are governed by an effective gravitational constant given by @xmath247 .",
    "notice that one should not simply try to put @xmath77 into eq .",
    "( [ eq:60 ] ) to get the @xmath7 limit , since under this condition the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq:57 ] ) always dominates over @xmath248 and can never be neglected .",
    "the correct @xmath249 limit is recovered by setting @xmath250 ( according to eq .",
    "( [ eq:57 ] ) ) and all other terms relating @xmath206 and @xmath251 to @xmath123 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:56 ] ) , which just leads to eq .",
    "( [ eq:61 ] ) , and shows that the early - matter - era growth of perturbations is well described by gr .",
    "( upper panel ) and @xmath252 ( lower panel ) .",
    "upper panel : the black , red , green solid curves represent @xmath253 respectively ( @xmath225 ) . lower panel : the black , red ,",
    "green curves represent @xmath254 respectively ( @xmath224 ) .",
    "dashed curves are the spectra for the @xmath16 model .",
    "@xmath255 is adopted for illustration .",
    "we see that a smaller @xmath252 can bring the shape of the spectrum closer to the @xmath16 one : in this case data on large scale structure can not place stringent constraints on the model . ]",
    "we can now make a comparison between the matter power spectra in metric and palatini @xmath0 cosmologies .",
    "in the later , it has been shown that any small deviation from gr will cause the small - scale spectra to differ from the gr one in observationally unacceptable ways , either blowing up or oscillating and being prevented from growing @xcite .",
    "this is because in the palatini @xmath0 gravity @xmath30 and @xmath256 satisfy an algebraic equation @xmath257 such that those terms involving @xmath258 can always be rewritten as @xmath259 and consequently a term @xmath260 appears in the growth equation which makes the growths on small scales strongly scale - dependent . in the metric @xmath0 gravity here , in contrast",
    ", @xmath206 is determined by the perturbations in @xmath256 through a differential equation eq .",
    "( [ eq:57 ] ) . as @xmath177 increases , the value of the perturbation in @xmath261 decreases , so that @xmath262 does not exceed @xmath263 and becomes @xmath177 independent , so its effect can not be as exotic as that arising in palatini @xmath0 theories .    before leaving this analysis",
    ", we want to briefly discuss the cosmological viability of the present model .",
    "a more rigorous analysis involves carefully searching the multidimensional parameter space ( as in @xcite ) and is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "firstly , we have seen that the background evolutions allowed by the model are rather close to the @xmath249 paradigm with particular choices of @xmath264 and so could be consistent with the snia observations .",
    "the confrontation between predictions and the data on the linear power spectrum is a little more complicated . for the cmb spectrum ,",
    "figure  [ fig:5 ] indicates that it is similar to the @xmath7 prediction at higher @xmath3 s and can also reduce the quadrupole power and bring it closer to the measured values @xcite ( we have also checked that this low-@xmath3 power reduction is a general feature of the model and is insensitive to the values of @xmath161 and @xmath265 ) .",
    "however , because of the limitation from cosmic variance , the influences on the likelihood analysis are expected to be small .",
    "for the matter spectrum , at small scales the power is significantly higher than for the @xmath227 case , yet the fact that it has similar shape to the latter indicates the possibility that a different choice of galaxy bias might be able to make the model s predictions consistent with , for example , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) observations .",
    "however , we notice that at wavenumber @xmath266 deviations from the @xmath7 shape start to be significant , which might potentially be in conflict with the data ; this could still be alleviated by reducing the quantity @xmath267 , as can be seen in figure  [ fig:8 ] .",
    "we conclude that constraints on this model from large - scale structure could be much weaker than those on the palatini @xmath0 models @xcite .",
    "this said , it is still interesting to obtain quantitative joint constraints from background cosmology , cmb , and matter power spectra on the model , and examine whether it can be made consistent with other cosmological observations ( such as considered in @xcite ) in the future .",
    "to summarise : in this article we have considered the cosmology of a subclass of metric @xmath0 gravity theories , that are characterised by @xmath8 , and have discussed both the flat background friedmann universe and its inhomogeneous perturbations . for the background evolution , we address the problem in both the jordan frame and the einstein frame and find the correspondences between them . generally , the evolution is attracted towards a saddle point in the phase space which has the characteristics of a matter - dominated era .",
    "if the initial conditions are chosen appropriately , the universe can stay in the vicinity of that point for a sufficiently long period of cdm - dominated evolution to occur .",
    "finally , it always passes this saddle point and evolves to a stable de sitter point .",
    "the cosmic expansion begins to accelerate during this transition period and a cosmic history that is consistent with observations is possible in this model , as expected from @xcite . in the einstein frame",
    ", the model reduces to one with a scalar field conformally coupled to ( non - relativistic ) matter , and it shares some of the properties of a chameleon field cosmologies . that cosmological model results in a matter - dominated era followed by an accelerating era can also be seen from the analysis in this frame .",
    "the @xmath7 limit of the model is also discussed .",
    "we derive the covariant and gauge invariant perturbation equations for @xmath0 gravity theories in general , which we believe to be rather convenient for numerical calculations , and applied them to the present model through a modified camb code .",
    "the linear spectra are obtained and discussed .",
    "the cmb power spectrum displays reductions in the low-@xmath3 power , which arises from a weakening of the isw effect because of insufficient late - time decay of the large - scale potentials , as shown in the plots of the evolution . for the matter power spectrum",
    ", we find that on small scales the matter density growth is nearly scale - independent , making the shape of the spectrum at large @xmath177 s similar to that of the @xmath7 spectrum .",
    "comparisons with the cmb and matter power spectra in palatini @xmath0 gravity theories are then made , which account for the dramatic differences between these two approaches to modify gr , despite the fact that they could have the same gravitational action .",
    "possible comparisons with different observational data sets are also briefly discussed .",
    "it is found that neither the data on background evolution , cmb spectrum , nor those on the matter power spectrum can be used to exclude the model .",
    "their joint constraints on the model , however , could be complicated and involve making a numerical search of the parameter space , which is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "however , we can see that constraints on this metric @xmath0 model could be much weaker than those on the palatini @xmath0 theories , because for the later ( 1 ) the cmb power is largely amplified at low @xmath3 s and ( 2 ) the matter power spectrum at small scales is strongly scale dependent , both conflicting with observations on cmb anisotropies and large scale structure .",
    "the form of @xmath0 adopted here is one of the few which could produce a viable model for the entire cosmic history . in this model",
    "the modifications to gr take effect only at late times .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to look for other models in which the modifications are significant at different times , along the lines of refs . @xcite . in @xcite , a model with @xmath268",
    "is considered in the palatini approach and its effects on the linear power spectra are also discussed . in @xcite ,",
    "this same model is investigated within the metric approach ; however , it actually gives a @xmath269-matter - dominated era ( @xmath270 ) , @xcite , rather than the standard matter - dominated era , and is not cosmologically viable .",
    "thus , it may still be meaningful to look for viable early - time @xmath0 cosmologies in the metric formalism .",
    "another interesting issue to explore is whether the @xmath271 gravity models might be more adapted to hot dark matter .",
    "these topics will be investigated elsewhere .",
    "bl is supported by the overseas research studentship , cambridge overseas trust and the department of applied mathematics and theoretical physics at the university of cambridge .",
    "we are grateful to professor ming - chung chu for early stimulating discussions on this topic and to professor sergei odintsov for his helpful suggestions on the manuscript and pointing out references to us .",
    "also we would like acknowledge the various conversations with dr .",
    "van acoleyen about the chameleon effect and solar system constraints of the @xmath0 model .",
    "it should be mentioned here that , as pointed out by s. nojiri & s.  d.  odintsov in @xcite and later implemented by song , hu & sawicki in @xcite , the generality of @xmath0 actually makes such models able to make arbitrary fixed background cosmologies consistent with observations .",
    "the result of @xcite excluded one class of @xmath0 models with simple forms of @xmath0 as suggested in the literature , while the present work ( and @xcite ) presents a counterexample that even the simple power - law @xmath0 might be able to produce a viable background cosmology .",
    "it is worth noticing that the evolution of the potential is much more complicated than that of a simple weak decay .",
    "in fact , from figure  [ fig:6 ] we can see that for smaller scales the potential first grows and then decays .",
    "these ( rather rapid ) growths of potential @xmath273 at later times could also _ enhance _ the isw effect , which is determined by the magnitude of @xmath274d\\tau\\]]where @xmath275 are the spherical bessel functions and @xmath276 the conformal time at present .",
