    "among the many symmetry reductions of general relativity that have been considered in the past , linearly polarized cylindrical waves ( also known as einstein - rosen waves @xcite ) have been the focus of intensive study .",
    "they provide a model with an infinite number of degrees of freedom that can be exactly solved in spite of the fact that it is non - linear .",
    "this is not only true classically but also quantum mechanically , and hence this system is a valuable tool to explore the physics that may be found if a successful quantization of full general relativity is ever achieved @xcite .",
    "one of the main reasons behind this success is the fact that the physical hamiltonian is a function of the free hamiltonian of a 2 + 1 dimensional , axially symmetric , massless scalar field evolving in an auxiliary minkowskian background @xcite . in a previous paper @xcite we took advantage of this fact to study the quantum corrections to the spacetime structure by considering the commutator of this scalar field at different spacetime points .",
    "as is well known , microcausality in quantum field theories can be discussed by looking at the commutator of quantum fields ( or anticommutator in the case of fermions ) . in the standard",
    "examples the microcausality requirement means that this ( anti)commutator must vanish for spatially separated spacetime points .",
    "a similar argument can be made for vector fields , though issues of gauge invariance change some of the conclusions ; in particular if one computes the commutator of the four - vector potential @xmath0 at two spatially separated points , it may be different from zero in some gauges , even though it is always true that the commutator of gauge invariant objects is zero for such points .",
    "the issue of gauge invariance in the context of cylindrical gravitational waves has been discussed at length by bik and collaborators @xcite .",
    "these authors show that is is legitimate to use the ashtekar - pierri gauge fixed action @xcite written in terms of the scalar field that encodes the physical information in this model to obtain gauge invariant structures such as dirac observables or the s matrix .",
    "this justifies the computation of the type of objects field commutators that we will be considering here to extract conclusions about the quantum structure of spacetime .",
    "the particular problem that we will be concerned with in this paper is the detailed study of the field commutator ( given as a certain integral ) and , in particular , its limiting behavior when the time and length separations are much larger than the natural length scale of the problem the planck length. in order to do this the procedure of expanding the integrand of the field commutator as a power series in the gravitational constant and other asymptotic parameters is not useful .",
    "in fact it will be necessary to adapt some methods developed for the asymptotic analysis of integrals and get a consistent procedure to expand the relevant objects as asymptotic series .",
    "it is possible to understand this _ a posteriori _ as a consequence of the fact that some limiting behaviors ( i.e. in @xmath1 ) of the field commutator change in a non trivial way as the spacetime intervals go from spacelike to timelike or when one of the spacetime points lies in the symmetry axis .",
    "also the functional dependence in some of these parameters is highly non - polynomial .",
    "this is not what one would expect to obtain in the familiar perturbative treatment of quantum field theories ( qft s ) .",
    "the paper is divided in two main sections : a physical discussion of the behavior of the field commutator followed by a detailed description of the asymptotic methods necessary to study the different physically relevant regimes .",
    "specifically , after this introduction we will give the different asymptotic expansions for all the relevant parameters ( involving the @xmath2 limit and also the limits in which the difference in the time coordinates or the radial coordinates go to infinity ) .",
    "using them we will discuss the main physical consequences of the quantization of this model as far as microcausality is concerned . in this respect",
    "it is particulary interesting to point out the existence of a certain type of large quantum mechanical effects ( in a sense that will be made precise later ) when one of the spacetime points in the field commutator lies in the symmetry axis .",
    "a technical issue that should be considered is the role of regulators in the final physical results . as is well known regulators are necessary to give sense to otherwise ill - defined objects .",
    "they must be introduced , for example , to obtain a finite norm vector by acting with the field operator on the vacuum state .",
    "cut - offs are a simple way to regulate amplitudes .",
    "it is conceivable that physical regulators exist that restrict , for example , the integration intervals for some physical objects ( such as the field commutators considered here ) to finite real intervals .",
    "however it is also possible that they are just a convenient way to render some physical objects finite in such a way that no footprint is left in the final results .",
    "this is the philosophy that one has in mind in the usual renormalization scheme where cut - offs are taken to infinity and disappear from physical quantities .",
    "the point of view of this paper is that the un - regulated objects ( integrals ) , when defined , are a good approximation to the regulated ones .",
    "the asymptotic analysis of regulated commutators and their relation with the un - regulated ones will be discussed elsewhere .    in the usual perturbative qft computations green functions , matrix elements , and similar objects",
    "are expanded as power series in the coupling constants of the model with coefficients that are usually written as regulated integrals .",
    "this is a necessary step because it is usually not possible to write them in closed form .",
    "here the situation is different because it is possible to write down expressions for the objects of interest ( field commutators in the present example ) that depend on the coupling constants in a non trivial way .",
    "this has the advantage of allowing us to use approximation techniques specially adapted to their specific form and much better suited to its study .",
    "it also permits to consider some problems that may be difficult to tackle for the usual qft s ; for example one can try to figure out if the asymptotic behavior of some regulated object coincides with its asymptotic behavior after the regulator is removed .",
    "a detailed technical discussion of the techniques needed to explore the relevant asymptotic regimes is presented in section [ maths ] .",
    "these techniques will be useful tools in order to analyze other types of physical objects ( such as s - matrix elements ) so they provide the necessary background for a perturbative framework properly adapted to this model , this is why we invest some time to study them here .",
    "we end the paper with a summary of the main results , comments , perspectives for future work , and several appendices .",
    "numerical and algebraic computations have been performed with the aid of _ _ mathematica__@xmath3 .",
    "we start with a brief description of the model and introduce our conventions and notation .",
    "as is well known @xcite einstein - rosen waves correspond to topologically trivial spacetimes with two linearly independent , commuting , spacelike , and hypersurface orthogonal killing vector fields .",
    "the metric in this case can be writen as @xmath4 where we are using coordinates @xmath5 , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are functions only of @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the einstein field equations for this metric are very simple : the scalar field @xmath6 must satisfy the wave equation for a massless , axially symmetric scalar field in three dimensions @xmath10 and the function @xmath7 can be expressed in terms of this field on the classical solutions @xcite as @xmath11.\\ ] ] throughout the paper we will use a system of units such that @xmath12 and define @xmath13 , where @xmath14 denotes the gravitational constant per unit length in the direction of the symmetry axis has dimensions of length . ] .",
    "the metric function @xmath15 admits a simple physical interpretation : apart from a factor of @xmath16 it is the energy of the scalar field in a ball of radius @xmath8 , and @xmath17 the energy of the whole two - dimensional flat space .",
    "furthermore , @xmath18 coincides with the hamiltonian @xmath19 of the system obtained by linearizing the metric ( [ metric])@xcite .    in order to arrive at a unit asymptotic timelike killing vector that allows us to introduce a physical notion of energy ( per unit length ) it is convenient to use coordinates @xmath20 defined by @xmath21 . in these coordinates the metric takes the form @xcite @xmath22 by choosing a metric function @xmath6 with a sufficiently fast fall - off as @xmath23 , this metric describes asymptotically flat spacetimes with a certain ( non - zero ) deficit angle and such that @xmath24 is a unit timelike killing vector in the asymptotic region .",
    "the einstein field equations can be obtained from a hamiltonian action principle @xcite where the hamiltonian @xmath25 is a function of that corresponding to the free scalar field , @xmath19 : @xmath26 in the following we will refer to @xmath27 as the physical time and to @xmath25 as the physical hamiltonian .    in terms of the @xmath9-time and imposing",

    "one of its interesting features is the fact that it is not proportional to the identity as in the case of free theories ( or if we consider the quantum evolution defined by the hamiltonian @xmath19 of the linearized model ) but is a non - diagonal operator in the chosen basis .",
    "we are hence led to consider its matrix elements .",
    "we will concentrate here on the most relevant of these elements ( at least from the perspective of the microcausality of the classical background of the model ) , namely the vacuum expectation value , which is explicitly given by @xmath50\\,|0\\rangle= \\int_0^{\\infty}\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!dk\\,j_0(r_1 k)j_0(r_2 k)\\sin\\left[\\frac{t_2-t_1}{4g}(1\\!-\\!e^{-4gk})\\right]\\!. \\hspace*{.4cm}&&\\label{integral}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as we can see it depends on the time coordinates through their difference @xmath51 ( which we will assume to be , e.g. , positive ) and depends symmetrically on @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
