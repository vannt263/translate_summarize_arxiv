    "discrete material models , which represent a material as a network of particles interacting via inter - particle potentials , have received a steadily increasing attention in the fields of theoretical , computational and applied materials science in the last decade , see , e.g. , reviews by  @xcite and references therein . from the engineering point of view",
    ", the interest has been nourished by the possibility to address , in a conceptually simple framework , the interplay among the intrinsic material heterogeneities , discreteness and randomness on different levels of resolution .",
    "examples of the successful application of discrete models include the simulation of materials with complex microstructures such as paper  @xcite , biological materials  @xcite , low - density materials  @xcite and granular media  @xcite .",
    "another field of application where the discrete modeling concept plays an irreplaceable role is the analysis of localized phenomena in heterogeneous media , such as local buckling and delamination in thin films , e.g.  @xcite , or , most typically , the simulation of damage and fracture processes in cohesive - frictional materials , see  @xcite to cite a few .",
    "the closely related problem of establishing a rigorous link between a discrete representation and its equivalent continuum response has been the focus of numerous works .",
    "the goal of such studies is to identify an appropriate continuum representation with materials constants directly related to the underlying discrete system . within the computational approaches ,",
    "perhaps the most prominent example is the local quasi - continuum method , introduced by  @xcite , in which the effective behavior of a material point is adaptively deduced from the response of its finite neighborhood , constrained by the cauchy - born rule ; see  @xcite for further details and discussion on related concepts .",
    "complementary to the numerical treatment , a notable research effort has been put into a rigorous interpretation of infinite - size limits of discrete models from the point of view of standard and generalized continua . for systems interacting via potentials satisfying suitable growth conditions",
    ", a general local continuum representation is currently available , proven using the tools of @xmath0-convergence  @xcite or the thermodynamical limit procedure due to  @xcite .",
    "these results were further utilized to provide rigorous bounds on the effective macroscopic conductivity of discrete lattices  @xcite or as a theoretical support for the quasi - continuum approximation to _ ab initio _ calculations of material constants  @xcite .",
    "recently , both frameworks were successfully extended to the stochastic setting , see  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the validity of the cauchy - born rule were rigorously examined in  @xcite and @xcite for both regular and irregular networks , thus explicitly demonstrating potential limitations of the cauchy - born type continuum approximation when applied to discrete localized phenomena .    in such cases ,",
    "generalized continuum theories provide a well - established way to introduce an internal lengthscale to the problem , thereby preventing the pathological localization or singularities of mechanical fields , see e.g. reviews  @xcite .",
    "particular examples of gradient - based theories include the one- and two - dimensional large strain elasticity studies by  @xcite and  @xcite , the micropolar continuum description of  @xcite and  @xcite or the arbitrary - order convex expansion scheme due to  @xcite .",
    "finally , an exhaustive analysis of one - dimensional systems with generic nearest - neighbor interactions rigorously demonstrated that the limit behavior may exhibit both diffuse as well as localized cracking , in the deterministic  @xcite and stochastic  @xcite setting , including the numerical analysis of discrete - to - continuum coupling in the deterministic case  @xcite .",
    "more recently , these results were extended by  @xcite , who studied continuum limits of lattices with randomly distributed defects and showed that the effective behavior is governed by percolation phenomena .",

    "we address in detail a specific problem of the mechanics of random discrete media , namely the formulation of total potential energy estimates for finite binary lattices with a fixed geometry and a heterogeneity distribution described by second - order spatial statistics .",
    "variational bounds and estimates are established by extending the recent works of @xcite related to the galerkin discretization of the stochastic hashin - shtrikman - willis  ( @xmath1 ) variational principles  @xcite .",
    "our motivation for focusing on finite - sized systems and the potential energy instead of the more common continuum setting and local stress- or strain - related quantities arises from the following considerations :    * the separation - of - scales assumption is inherently not applicable when dealing with finite discrete structures .",
    "this renders the resulting theory well - suited to predict the statistics of localized responses .",
    "* in view of recent advances in variational models of complete damage  @xcite , the global energetic bounds / estimates provide an essential ingredient for the development of rational damage mechanics of discrete networks . * due to the simple structure of the underlying theory , the relevant statistics can be characterized with a generality which is currently not available for continuous systems , cf .  .",
    "* highly accurate estimates of the quantities of interest for general structures and loading regimes can be determined on the basis of simple monte - carlo simulations , see also @xcite for a related one - dimensional study in the continuous setting .",

    "note that the last condition in   enforces the elimination of rigid - body modes .",
    "when subjecting the structure to an additional nodal load @xmath37 acting on free  , the unknown displacements @xmath38 can be found by solving the unconstrained quadratic optimization problem @xmath39 where the total potential energy function @xmath40 is provided by @xmath41 with , for example , @xmath42 being a sub - matrix of the global stiffness matrix @xmath43 .",
    "the symbol `` @xmath44 '' appearing in denotes the minimizer of the objective function verifying @xmath45 where the equality is attained only for the test displacement @xmath46 coinciding with the true solution due to positive definiteness of @xmath47 .",
    "the optimality conditions for @xmath38 then yield the global equilibrium equations in the form @xmath48      we now proceed with the introduction of a suitable framework for binary random discrete media , i.e. structures in which every element can be found in one of two distinct states @xmath49 . due to the discrete nature of the problem at hand , the ensemble space  @xmath50 collecting all structural configurations is finite - dimensional and as such can be enumerated using an index @xmath51 , @xmath52 the complete statistical characterization of the discrete stochastic system is then simply provided by assigning probabilities @xmath53 to individual configurations @xmath51 stored in the probability distribution vector @xmath54 the ensemble average of a configuration - dependent quantity @xmath55 for a given probability distribution @xmath56 is defined as @xmath57    of particular importance is the state characteristic vector @xmath58 defined via @xmath59 quantifying the spatial distribution of individual states in a given configuration @xmath51 . for the current , binary , case , @xmath58 can be explicitly expressed in the form @xmath60 where @xmath61 provides the value of a natural number @xmath62 in the binary notation using @xmath17  digits arranged in a column matrix , see   for an illustration",

    "following the analogy with the quantification of the spatial statistics of random heterogeneous media , e.g.  @xcite , we introduce an @xmath64 two - unit probability matrix related to a given probability distribution @xmath65 in the form @xmath66 where an individual entry @xmath67 represents the probability of states @xmath68 and @xmath69 being assigned to elements @xmath70 and @xmath71  ( note that the explicit dependence on @xmath65 is dropped for the sake of notational brevity ) .",
    "the two - unit matrices related to distinct states are not independent of each other : using  @xmath72 yields @xmath73 with @xmath74 .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to concentrate on the statistics @xmath75 below .",
    "it directly follows from the definition   that any two - element probability matrix has to be located in a convex hull of rank - one products of the characteristic vectors of individual configurations : @xmath76 coinciding with the boolean quadratic polytope completely characterized by  @xcite .",
    "conversely , two - element probability matrices can be used as a convenient re - parameterization of @xmath77 . to that end",
    ", we introduce a set storing all probability distributions compatible with matrix @xmath75 as @xmath78 thus establishing a partial statistical characterization when full information is not available .    at this point",
    ", we can introduce the terminology used hereafter .",
    "given a two - unit probability matrix @xmath75 , the associated discrete system is called _ statistically uniform _ if @xmath79 i.e. the one - unit probabilities of individual elements are independent of @xmath70 , while the two - unit probabilities depend only on the difference of coordinates of element centers @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "in addition , a function @xmath82 is _ statistically local _  ( or first - order ) if it depends on the first - order statistics only : @xmath83 in the opposite case , we use the adjectives _ statistically non - local _  ( or second - order ) .",
    "it is perhaps instructive to briefly comment on similarities and differences with the analogous development in the continuous case . in particular ,",
    "the two - element probability matrix is a direct analogue of the two - point probability functions for generic statistically non - uniform and anisotropic microstructures  @xcite .",
    "the set @xmath84 then coincides with the set of all admissible two - point probability functions , the analysis of which has recently received substantial attention in the field of random heterogeneous materials , eventually resulting in a complete characterization for statistically uniform media as shown by  @xcite ; see also  @xcite for further discussion . in this connection ,",
    "the advantage of considering finite discrete systems becomes immediately visible , since the characterization of  @xcite is free of assumption of statistical uniformity .",
    "when assigning specific material properties to each state @xmath68 , the previously introduced framework can be readily adopted to two - phase elastic heterogeneous lattices . in particular , the configuration - dependent material stiffness matrix on the element level , @xmath85 , can be written as @xmath86 where @xmath87 are generalized material stiffness matrices of individual states . on the structural level ,",
    "the stiffness distribution is described by @xmath88 where @xmath89 denotes a block hadamard - like product implementing the assembly operation .",

    "therefore , we rely on a partial statistical characterization in terms of two - element probabilities and attempt to establish energetic bounds / estimates in the form @xmath98 reflecting the limited probabilistic characterization .",
    "in addition to the energetics , we also provide elementary statistics of the nodal displacements related to the bounds and estimates of the energy introduced in  .",
    "in this section , we provide explicit energetic bounds for random finite - size networks by reconsidering the hashin - shtrikman variational principles for random heterogeneous media in the discrete setting . to make the exposition more readable ,",
    "the derivations are structured in six consecutive steps .",
    "following the conceptual lead of  @xcite , we introduce a reference deterministic structure characterized by a positive - definite generalized material stiffness matrix @xmath99 and consider a realization - dependent quadratic form @xmath100 where @xmath101 is a test generalized strain vector and the auxiliary variable @xmath102 will be commented on later . by virtue of the schur complement lemma , cf .",

    "moreover , when the polarization stress is compatible with the difference in stiffness distribution between the two configurations @xmath99 and @xmath90 and the imposed generalized strain , the gap between and upper bound and the true value vanishes .",
    "notice that when the optimization with respect to @xmath105 is performed exactly , the resulting equality   is independent of the choice of the reference structure . otherwise , e.g. when the set of admissible generalized polarizations @xmath105 is constrained , different choices of @xmath99 generate different upper bounds on the stored energy .",

    "in particular , we consider the lattice shown in   subject to an imposed displacement , which is parametrized as @xmath257 leading to a linear scaling of the element energies   with respect to the pseudo - time  @xmath258 .    for simplicity , identical values of the young s moduli , @xmath259 ,",

    "note that the diagonal entries of the @xmath269 matrix provide , in the current setting , the survival probability for each element at time  @xmath258 .",
    "the off - diagonal values correspond to the simultaneous survival probabilities for two elements .    in the case of uniform tension",
    ", the damage distribution appears to be rather diffuse during the whole loading procedure .",
    "low survival probabilities are localized in the horizontal links in the corners of the network and in the structure s interior , as these exhibit the highest failure affinity for the deterministic solution with @xmath270  ( pseudo - time @xmath271 .",
    "the slight non - symmetry of the one - unit probabilities visible in   results from the finite number of realizations used to sample the statistics . with increasing load ,",
    "the remaining horizontal elements start to fail due to the energy redistribution after failure of the first group of weakest links , leading to a decrease of the survival probabilities for the interior elements  ( @xmath267 ) . in the case of bending , on the other hand , the damage is triggered mainly in the upper and lower rows of elements and subsequently propagates to internal links .",
    "additional details on the simultaneous survival probabilities are given by the full two - unit probability matrices , shown in   for @xmath272 .",
    "recalling element numbering introduced in  , the plots reveal , among other things , simultaneous survival probabilities close to one for vertical element groups @xmath273@xmath274 and @xmath275@xmath276 , which connects the nodes where the load is imposed , and horizontal elements @xmath277@xmath278 , at the neutral axis , in the case of bending .",
    "it follows from these results that the second - order statistics correctly capture the dominant fracture mechanisms , thereby providing a well - founded statistically non - local damage parameter for stochastic damage theories .",
    "the evolution of the normalized stored energy @xmath279 is depicted in  .",
    "the choice of reference structures to generate the bounds or estimates is identical to that in the previous example .",
    "note that the lower bounds and the @xmath196 estimate are identically equal to zero due to the zero stiffness assigned to the weaker state .",
    "the overall character of the energy evolution is consistent with the previous discussion . in particular , two failure modes are clearly visible for the bending problem , whereas the gradual decrease in energy for uniform tension corresponds to more a diffuse damage character . similarly to  , the first - order voigt bounds correctly predict the trend of the energy reduction , but under predicts its magnitude .",
    "the @xmath1 bound remains highly accurate until @xmath280 .",
    "a certain discrepancy , however , is observed for the limit value of the dimensionless energy , e.g. @xmath281 instead of the reference @xmath282 for uniform tension , cf .  ( a ) .",
    "this difference again arises due to the fact that the upper @xmath1 bound corresponds , in the ensemble average sense , to the response of the stiffest structure compatible with the two - unit statistics shown in  , for which the minimum probability reaches @xmath283 for both loading sequences .",
    "the results of the @xmath184  simulations , on the other hand , represent one particular stochastic system implicitly defined by the randomization procedure and the event - by - event solution algorithm .",
    "nevertheless , the added value of the second - order relations becomes apparent when considering the voigt prediction @xmath284 .",
    "slightly more accurate values of the residual relative energy can be generated using the @xmath195 estimate , for which we obtain  @xmath285 .",
    "the general character of these conclusions is further supported by the analogous results of the bending mode shown in  ( b ) .",
    "in this work , variational bounds and estimates of the hashin - shtrikman - willis  ( @xmath1 ) type for two - phase random structures have been derived and verified against the results of direct monte - carlo  ( @xmath184 ) simulations .",
    "the most important findings can be summarized as follows :    * when applied to discrete structures instead of continua , the derivation of the @xmath1 principles becomes reasonably straightforward and requires only elements of matrix structural analysis and linear algebra . *",
    "the variational framework naturally incorporates general statistically non - uniform systems , including the specification of the set of all admissible two - unit probability matrices .",
    "thus , the developed statistically non - local theory is able to treat the statistics of systems with independent and highly correlated units in a unified manner . *",
    "the second - order bounds and estimates provide a computationally feasible alternative to direct @xmath184 simulations .",
    "* when applied to the displacement - driven damage problems , the upper bound on the stored energy delivers a reasonably accurate approximation to the total potential energy at the damage initiation and propagation without any adjustable parameters .",
    "when complemented with an accurate representation of the irreversible energy dissipation during the damage process , the scheme has the potential to provide a consistent variational model for damage evolution in discrete media .",
    "the developed statistically non - local discrete theory can also provide a convenient starting point for the coarsening towards an equivalent continuum representation .",
    "the already announced applications , i.e. a variational approach to deterministic and stochastic damage mechanics of finite - sized lattices and incorporation of higher - order statistics , will explored and reported separately in future publications .",
    "recall that the expression for the condensed energy follows from the value of the hashin - shtrikman function   with the displacement vector optimally adjusted to a trial generalized polarization stress  @xmath105 .",
    "in particular , evaluating the energy for the displacement  @xmath286 determined from   yields , in a partitioned format : @xmath287    a suitable re - arrangement of terms appearing in the previous relation together with the optimality conditions   and   leads to @xmath288 which coincides with the expression for the condensed energy as appearing in  . note that similar development for the continuous case is available in , e.g. ,  @xcite and in  @xcite , with the fe - discretization treated in  @xcite .",
