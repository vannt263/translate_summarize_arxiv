    "one of the fundamental issues of the observational cosmology is the evolutionary connection between various classes of galaxies .",
    "since galaxies show a large range of physical properties and activities , they are classified using various criteria : morphology ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , colour ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , spectral features ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and so on . knowledge about those various kinds of galaxies has been accumulated for a long time , motivating many efforts to find the connections between different galaxy classes and their implication on galaxy evolution . however , since the galaxy classifications in most previous studies were limited to only one or two properties , some detailed aspects in galaxy evolution have not been sufficiently inspected .",
    "for example , galaxies with unusual features , such as blue early - type galaxies @xcite or passive spiral galaxies @xcite are difficult to understand well in studies using simple galaxy classifications . the necessity of fine classifications of galaxies was also pointed out in @xcite , who reported that the fundamental planes of early - type galaxies with different spectral classes have a potential difference in the slope , indicating that even morphologically similar galaxies have different natures if they have different spectral features . recently , ( * ? ? ? * hereafter paper i ) presented the optical properties of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) galaxies in various fine classes based on their morphology , colour and spectral features , showing that each galaxy class has its own distinguishable features and that an analysis based on a simple classification often has a risk of mixing up different kinds of objects with different nature .",
    "this is the second in a series of papers on the nature of galaxies in the finely - divided classes .",
    "this paper is focused on the multi - wavelength properties of galaxies in the fine classes . since the source and mechanism of light emission",
    "are often different for different wavelength bands , multi - wavelength data provide much information about galaxies that is difficult to acquire from optical data only .",
    "we divide the extra - optical bands into five categories : x - ray ; ultraviolet ( uv ) ; near - infrared ( nir ) ; mid- and far - infrared ( mir and fir ) ; and radio .",
    "the x - ray is sensitive to hot thermal gas @xcite or active galactic nucleus ( agn ) activity @xcite .",
    "the uv light is sensitive to young stellar populations or very old stellar populations like core - helium burning low mass stars @xcite .",
    "since the uv @xmath0 optical colour is more sensitive to young stars than the optical colour , the uv information is useful to constrain the mean stellar ages of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the nir light is sensitive to the old stellar population and metal abundance in a galaxy @xcite .",
    "since the optical light is sensitive both to the age and metallicity of galaxies , the combination of the information in the optical and nir bands is useful to estimate the mean stellar age and mean stellar metallicity of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the mir and fir light is sensitive to the dust contents in galaxies @xcite . since vigorous star formation ( sf )",
    "is usually accompanied by rich dust production @xcite , the information in the mir and fir bands is helpful to inspect sf activity .",
    "in addition , the mir and fir light is also sensitive to agn activity @xcite .",
    "the radio shows hot gas contents in a galaxy by means of supernovae - induced synchrotron radiation , which are direct probes to current sf activity free from dust extinction @xcite .",
    "moreover , since the surroundings of a central blackhole emit a large amount of synchrotron radio flux in some kinds of agns , the radio is also valuable in studies of the agn activity in galaxies @xcite .    since multi - wavelength data provide advantages in probing the nature of galaxies , some previous studies used multiple data sets covering different wavelength bands .",

    "* ) data , finding that the optical colours of elliptical galaxies are sensitive to age , metallicity and @xmath1-enhancement , while the optical @xmath0 nir colours are sensitive to metallicity and to @xmath1-enhancement , but are less sensitive to age .",
    "@xcite investigated the optical properties of 4248 infrared galaxies using the sdss and the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ; * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite conducted a very rare study on galaxy evolution using data covering all available wavelength bands , finding that there are strong correlations between the optical properties of galaxies and their detection fraction at other wavelengths .",
    "these previous studies produced many important results about galaxy evolution , but much more still remains to be investigated .",
    "multi - wavelength data sets provide very useful information to understand the nature of galaxies divided into fine classes , constraining their star formation history , obscured agn activities , dust contents , ans so on .",
    "we have been doing a comprehensive study on a set of fine galaxy classes in the sdss , based on their morphology , colour and spectral features . in this paper ,",

    ", we estimate the star formation rate ( sfr ) of galaxies in each fine class using multiple methods . based on those multi - wavelength properties ,",
    "we discuss the nature of galaxies in the fine classes in  10 . finally , the conclusions in this paper are given in  11 . throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt the cosmological parameters @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 .",
    "we use the sdss data release 4 ( dr4 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) main galaxy sample .",
    "the sdss is a photometric and spectroscopic survey , that has mapped about one quarter of the whole sky .",
    "the photometric and spectroscopic observations were conducted using the 2.5-m sdss telescope at the apache point observatory in new mexico , usa . the sdss photometry was conducted in the @xmath5 band images , with effective wavelengths of 3551 , 4686 , 6166 , 7480 and 8932  , respectively @xcite .",

    "in addition , we use the velocity dispersion estimated using an automated spectroscopic pipeline called idlspec2d version 5 ( d. schlegel et al . , in preparation ) . using the sdss atlas images ,",
    "we have measured the colour gradient , inverse concentration index , and the axis ratio of galaxies corrected for the inclination and the seeing effects @xcite .    after foreground extinction correction @xcite ,",
    "the magnitude of each galaxy was corrected in two aspects : the redshift effect ( k - correction ) and galaxy luminosity evolution ( evolutionary correction ) .",
    "we used the method of @xcite to conduct k - correction , and the empirical formula of @xcite to conduct evolutionary correction .",
    "the evolutionary correction formula of @xcite was derived by means of a simple fit of galaxy luminosity evolution without galaxy type segregation , which means that it is not very accurate . however , since the evolutionary correction values in the redshift range of our galaxy sample are not large , we used the simple method of @xcite . using these methods , we corrected the observed magnitudes of about 360,000 sdss galaxies into the magnitudes at redshift z = 0.1 , where the sdss galaxies were observed most frequently .",
    "since the corrections are applied optionally in this paper , we denote the magnitude with k - correction as @xmath11 and the magnitude with both k - correction and evolutionary correction as @xmath12 , if the observed magnitude is @xmath13 .",
    "we use petrosian magnitudes to represent optical brightness , while we use model magnitudes to calculate galaxy colours .",
    "the sdss official website recommends petrosian magnitudes for flux estimation of bright ( enough to be included in the sdss spectroscopic sample ) extended sources , while it recommends model magnitudes for colour calculation of extended sources , because the model magnitude is measured consistently in all bands , based on the best - fit parameters in the @xmath9 band .",
    "we use the 2mass extended source catalogue ( xsc ) . using the mt .",

    "we estimated the probability of false match by calculating the match number of the sdss objects to random catalogue with the same number density as the 2mass catalogue @xcite , finding that the false match probability between sdss and 2mass is about 0.005 per cent . to estimate the optical @xmath0 nir colour within the same aperture , we calculated the sdss magnitude within the 2mass fiducial circular aperture , using the method of @xcite .",

    "the nvss catalogue has about 2.5 mjy completeness limit , including about 1.8 million sources .",
    "the nvss is complementary to the first , because the first sometimes splits an extended radio structure into multiple sources due to its very high resolution @xcite .",
    "the nvss sources were matched to the sdss objects with @xmath32 tolerance , which returns about 11,000 sources with 9.40 per cent false match probability .",
    "we use the galex survey gr2/gr3 data .",

    "it should be noted that the sfrs of agn host galaxies ( i.e. seyferts and liners ) in most methods are inaccurate , because most sfr measures are rendered by the emission of agn itself , such as h@xmath1 line , ir luminosity , radio luminosity , and so on .",

    "this is because the median sfrs in each survey were estimated using each sub - sample that includes only the galaxies detected in each survey , not the full sample .",
    "that is why it is important to consider the detection fration of each class in each survey . in other words , the regs detected in the iras",

    "since each ratio is estimated using each sub - sample that includes only the galaxies detected both in the compared two surveys , not the full sample , it should be reminded that each value in table [ sfrrtab ] was derived from a very small part of the full sample . in table",
    "[ sfrrtab ] , it is found that the sfr@xmath41/sfr@xmath46 of blgs is significantly smaller than that of rlgs , which indicates that the dust contents of rlgs are richer than those of blgs , at least in the compared sub - samples .",

    "on the other hand , the radio detection fraction of non - passive rlgs does not strongly depend on their absolute magnitude , showing that the major radio source in non - passive rlgs may be sf .",
    "these results support the idea of paper i that @xmath48rlgs are the intermediate objects between early - type galaxies and late - type galaxies : extremely bulge - dominated late - type galaxies .    in summary , ( a )",
    "there is no clear evidence that rlgs are dust - richer than blgs , and ( b ) they seem to have intermediate star formation between regs and blue galaxies .",
    "( c ) the uv  optical  nir colours indicate that rlgs have not only a considerable amount of old stars but also more young stars than regs .",
    "( d ) as they do in the optical properties , @xmath48rlgs show properties similar to regs in their multi - wavelength colours and radio detection trend .",
    "blgs correspond to well - known spiral or irregular galaxies typically with blue colour , low light - concentration and vigorous sf .",
    "paper i showed that most blgs are star - forming ( @xmath42blgs ) , but a very small fraction of blgs have no evidence of current star formation ( @xmath48blgs ) .",
    "it was also shown that there are some blgs with agn ( @xmath49blgs , @xmath50blgs ) . in this paper , some previously known properties",
    "are confirmed using multi - wavelength data , and new hints on the identity of @xmath48blgs are found .",
    "blgs are relatively poorly - detected in the nir bands , while their detection fraction in the uv , mir , fir and radio is largest among all classes .",
    "this reflects the fact that blgs are mostly late - type galaxies with vigorous sf .",
    "the sfr@xmath69 and sfr@xmath70}}$ ] of @xmath42blgs are largest among all classes .",
    "sfr@xmath69(@xmath42blg ) is larger than sfr@xmath69(@xmath42reg ) by 1.7 dex ; larger than sfr@xmath69(@xmath42rlg ) by 0.7 dex ; and larger than sfr@xmath69(@xmath42beg ) by 0.2 dex .",
    "however , in the estimation using the ir , radio and uv , the sfr of blgs is not particularly larger than the other classes sfrs , due to the selection effect ( described in  [ sfr ] ) .",
    "the cmrs in different wavelength datasets reveal the dependence of blgs stellar population on their luminosity . while the optical cmr slope of blgs is significantly larger than that of regs ( paper i ) , the @xmath54 cmr slope of blgs is similar to those of regs in fig .",
    "[ lrk ] . since optical  nir colour is known to be less sensitive to the stellar age than optical colour @xcite , this variation of the cmr slope according to wavelength indicates that the age difference between bright blgs and faint blgs is significantly responsible for the rapid cmr slope of blgs in the optical band .",
    "furthermore , @xmath42blgs show a tight and linear uv cmr , which is even tighter than that of regs .",
    "since uv light is very sensitive to stellar age , the tight uv cmrs of @xmath42blgs reflects their well - defined luminosity  age relation .",
    "these results show that faint blgs are younger than bright blgs . from this ,",
    "the previously known mass  age relation ( or galaxy downsizing ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is confirmed using multi - wavelength data .",
    "@xmath48blgs are optically passive , but their uv  optical  nir colours indicate their mean stellar ages are quite young . thus ,",
    "if @xmath48blgs are intrinsically passive , their sf activity may have stopped recently .",
    "otherwise , there may be current sf in the outskirts of @xmath48blgs that makes @xmath48blgs blue in the optical and uv bands , but their emission lines are not detected in the sdss fibre spectroscopy .",
    "the detection fraction of @xmath48blgs ( 3.90@xmath71 ) larger than that of @xmath42blgs ( 2.77@xmath71 ) shows a possibility that @xmath48blgs are dusty obscured @xmath42blgs , but the uncertainty is too large .    in summary , ( a )",
    "blgs are mostly late - type galaxies with vigorous sf and their sfr is largest among all classes .",
    "( b ) the previously known mass  age relation of galaxies ( i.e. galaxy downsizing ) is confirmed in blgs using multi - wavelength data , in the sense that faint blgs are younger than bright blgs .",
    "( c ) if @xmath48blgs are intrinsically passive , their sf activity may have stopped very recently .",
    "otherwise , there may be current sf in the outskirts of @xmath48blgs , out of the range of the sdss spectroscopy fibre .",
    "passive galaxies consist of four fine classes in this paper : @xmath48regs , @xmath48begs , @xmath48rlgs and @xmath48blgs .",
    "@xmath48regs show the properties of typical red elliptical galaxies that have evolved passively . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath48begs have blue colours and probably have suffered recent sf , although they do not show line emissions currently .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath48rlgs have properties similar to those of @xmath48regs and there is no evidence that they have suffered recent sf , but @xmath48rlgs are slightly more diffuse than @xmath48regs ( paper i ) . @xmath48blgs",
    "seem to be late - type galaxies that have suffered very recent sf quenching , or to be late - type galaxies with current sf in their outskirts .",
    "the four hii fine classes  @xmath42regs , @xmath42begs , @xmath42rlgs and @xmath42blgs  commonly show evidence for current sf . however , paper i presented that the spatial distribution of sf is different among those fine classes ; that is , the sf of @xmath42begs is relatively concentrated on their centres , while the sf in the other hii galaxies is mainly distributed in their outskirts . the three hii fine classes with outskirt - biased sf ",
    "@xmath42regs , @xmath42rlgs and @xmath42blgs  show also different properties from each other in this paper .",
    "for example , the sf features of @xmath42regs are hardly found in the relatively shallow surveys : iras , first and nvss , which implies that the sf activities in @xmath42regs are very weak .",
    "in addition , the uv  optical cmr of @xmath42rlgs seems not to be linear , unlike that of @xmath42blgs .",
    "different bulge - to - disc ratio among the fine classes may be responsible for those differences .    in the comparison of sfr@xmath70}}$ ] that is least affected by agn emission @xcite between agn host galaxies ( i.e. seyfert galaxies and liner galaxies ) , seyfert galaxies always have larger median sfr@xmath70}}$ ] than liner galaxies in a given morphology - colour class .",
    "since liners are less active agns than seyferts , this result means that more active agns ( seyferts ) have more active sf in their host galaxies .",
    "however , according to the agn feedback scenario , agn activity tends to suppress sf activity @xcite , which seems to contradict to our results if seyferts and liners are independent agn types .",
    "thus , if we adopt the agn feedback scenario , seyferts and liners may be evolutionarily connected ; for example , liner galaxies may be at the end of the agn feedback process , the sf of which may have been already sufficiently suppressed by agn activity at the seyfert phase .",
    "evidence of such evolutionary connections between different types of agns has been found in several recent studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "some agn host galaxy classes sometimes show different properties even though they are of the same agn type .",
    "for example , the differences in the median iras colours between @xmath49begs and @xmath49rlgs , and between @xmath50regs and @xmath50blgs are significantly large ( @xmath72 ) , which shows their different seds .",
    "the uv  optical cmrs are also obviously different between the fine classes of agn host galaxies : agn host early - type galaxies except for @xmath50begs have negative cmr slopes , while @xmath50begs and agn host late - type galaxies have positive cmr slopes .",
    "we can not fully explain what results in those differences among the fine classes in this paper .",
    "however , it is clear that such details could not even be found if galaxies were classified using simple schemes .",
    "the multi - wavelength properties of galaxies in the fine classes provide evidence supporting the main results in paper i , and add several new findings on them . since most main results are digested in the discussion section (  [ dis ] ) , we simply list the important findings in this paper here .    * from the uv  optical  nir colours , non - passive regs seem to have larger metallicity and younger age than @xmath48regs .",
    "this implies that non - passive regs may have suffered recent sf events , which have produced young and metal - rich stellar populations in them .",
    "* regs show conspicuous dependence of their radio luminosity on their optical absolute magnitude , which indicates that the major radio source in regs is radio - loud agns .",
    "some radio - loud regs are optically passive , corresponding to previously known _",
    "radio - loud agns without emission line_.    * @xmath42begs have the most negative slopes among all classes in the optical  nir cmr",
    ". both age and metallicity may affect the rapid cmr slope of @xmath42begs , but the effect of metallicity seems to be larger than that of age .",
    "* the uv  optical  nir colours of begs are well explained using the ssp + recent sf model , if it is supposed that there is no significant difference in their formation epoch between different spectral classes .",
    "* the iras detection fractions of @xmath48begs and @xmath50begs are small , compared to those of blgs , but the iras detection fractions of @xmath42begs and @xmath49begs are as large as those of blgs .",
    "this shows that @xmath42begs and @xmath49begs have very young or currently - forming stars , probably accompanied by rich dust reservoirs .",
    "* rlgs have intermediate star formation between regs and blue galaxies .",
    "the uv  optical  nir colours indicate that rlgs have not only a considerable amount of old stars but also more young stars than regs .    * the uv  optical colours and the radio detection trend of @xmath48rlgs show that @xmath48rlgs have properties similar to regs rather than non - passive rlgs .    *",
    "the iras detection fraction of rlgs is smaller than that of blgs , implying that dust extinction may not be the dominant factor making rlgs red .    *",
    "not only the cmr slope variation between the optical and nir bands but also the tight and linear uv cmr of @xmath42blgs shows that faint blgs are younger than bright blgs . from this , the previously known mass  age relation ( or galaxy downsizing )",
    "is confirmed using multi - wavelength data .    *",
    "the uv  optical  nir colours indicate that the mean stellar ages of @xmath48blgs are quite young . therefore ,",

    "<S> we present a multi - wavelength study of the nature of the sdss galaxies divided into fine classes based on their morphology , colour and spectral features . </S>",
    "<S> the sdss galaxies are classified into early - type and late - type ; red and blue ; passive , hii , seyfert and liner , which returns a total of 16 fine classes of galaxies . the properties of galaxies in each fine class are investigated from radio to x - ray , using 2mass , iras , first , nvss , galex and rosat data . </S>",
    "<S> the uv  optical  nir colours of blue early - type galaxies ( begs ) seem to result from the combination of old stellar population and recent star formation ( sf ) , if there is no significant difference in their formation epoch between different spectral classes . non - passive red early - type galaxies ( regs ) have larger metallicity and younger age than passive regs , considering their uv  optical  nir colours , which implies that non - passive regs have suffered recent sf adding young and metal - rich stars to them . </S>",
    "<S> the radio detection fraction of regs strongly depends on their optical absolute magnitudes , while that of most late - type galaxies does not , implying the difference in their radio sources : agn and sf . the optical  </S>",
    "<S> nir colours of red late - type galaxies ( rlgs ) reveal that they may have considerable old stars as well as young stars . </S>",
    "<S> the uv  optical colours and the radio detection fraction of passive rlgs show that they have properties similar to regs rather than non - passive rlgs . </S>",
    "<S> dust extinction may not be a dominant factor making rlgs red , because rlgs are detected in the mid- and far - infrared bands less efficiently than blue late - type galaxies ( blgs ) . </S>",
    "<S> the passive blgs have very blue uv  optical  nir colours , implying either recent sf quenching or current sf in their outskirts . </S>",
    "<S> including star formation rate , other multi - wavelength properties in each fine class are investigated , and their implication on the identity of each fine class is discussed .    </S>",
