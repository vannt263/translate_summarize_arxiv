    "it follows that for @xmath111 in the line segment of figure , we have @xmath148 where the sum is over a finite set @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 and @xmath152 are germs of analytic functions at @xmath121 .",

    "what is important is not the exact evaluation of @xmath167 given in , but the fact that the sequence @xmath167 is of nilsson type .",
    "this follows from the fact that we have an asymptotic expansion ( see @xcite ) : @xmath168 alternatively , one may show that the sequence @xmath167 is of nilsson type by a change of variables @xmath169 which gives @xmath170 where @xmath171 is a function which can be expanded into a polynomial of @xmath172 with coefficients functions which are analytic at @xmath173 .",

    "the asymptotic expansion remains valid as stated even when @xmath178 as follows by first integrating @xmath110 a sufficient number of times , and then applying the analysis .",
    "this is exactly what was done in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sec.7 ) at the cost of complicating the notation .",
    "since the sequence @xmath179 as a function of @xmath97 is exponentially bounded and the asymptotic expansion is gevrey-1 , it follows that the sequence @xmath180 is gevrey-1 .",
    "moreover , if the sequence @xmath179 lies in a number field @xmath100 , then we can write the asymptotic expansion of @xmath24 in the form where @xmath181 are polynomials ( with rational coefficients ) of values of logarithmic derivatives of the gamma function at rational numbers .",
    "in ( * ? ? ? * thm.1 ) it was proven that balanced multisum sequences ( which appear in abundance in enumerative combinatorics ) are sequences of nilsson type .",

    "the assumption implies that @xmath110 is an entire @xmath113-function .",
