    "diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) are absorption features seen abundantly in the galaxy towards highly reddened stars , implying that dibs exist in dusty environments .",
    "the current belief is that the majority of the several hundred dib lines discovered so far are due to organic molecules such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) . due to the possible connection to the building blocks of life ,",
    "dibs have experienced an enhanced level of interest in the last several years .",
    "because of the difficulty in detecting their relatively weak spectral features , extragalactic searches for dibs using qso absorption - lines are more rare ; however , there is one detection of the @xmath04428 dib line in a dla at @xmath1 toward ao 0235 + 164 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* junkkarinen 2004 ) ) .",
    "it would be desirable to put dibs on the same statistical grounds as metal line systems typically seen in qso absorption - line studies . in our search for extragalactic sources of dibs , we are investigating the feasibility of using the redshift path density ( @xmath2 ) to constrain the evolution of organic molecules through cosmic time and of using dibs as a proxy for finding dlas with @xmath3 . in this article",
    "we examine six dlas for the five strongest dib lines ( @xmath04428 , @xmath05780 , @xmath05797 , @xmath06284 , and @xmath06613 ) and place upper - limits on their strengths relative to galactic dibs .",
    ".equivalent width limits of dibs in dlas [ cols=\"^,^,^ , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]",
    "the results for our observations and predictions are presented in table 1 ; the observations are in bold .",
    "to arrive at our `` mw predicted '' limits for dib strengths we use a known correlation where the @xmath05780 equivalent width ( ew ) is proportional to the neutral hydrogen column density , @xmath4 , in milky way clouds ( ( * ? ?",
    "* herbig 1993 ) ; ) .",
    "we use this relation to scale the milky way values to the observed @xmath4 of the dlas .",
    "our results are plotted in the left panel of figure 1 for the @xmath05780 dib line . presented",
    "are observed limits on the dla dib strength versus expected milky way dib strength for a cloud with the dla @xmath4 .",
    "those points below the 1:1 correlation line correspond to dlas that are deficient in the @xmath05780 dib based purely on milky way expectations .",
    "four of our six dlas have @xmath05780 dib strengths at least 0.5 dex below milky way strengths .",
    "points above the 1:1 correlation line are unconstrained and additional data are required to obtain meaningful limits on the dib strengths . for our entries in table 1",
    ", we applied a similar scaling to the other dib lines using their relative strengths in the milky way ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* jenniskens & desert 1994 ) ) .",
    "the @xmath04428 dib line is scaled by an additional factor of 25% based on the dla at @xmath1 towards the qso ao 0235 + 164 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* junkkarinen 2004 ) ) .        including the dla metallicity",
    ", we estimate the dib strengths by @xmath5 \\mbox {   m{\\aa}},\\ ] ] where ew@xmath6 is the ew of the particular dib line in the milky way at log @xmath720.3 , the second factor is due to the slope of the known milky way relation between the log ew of the @xmath05780 dib line and the log @xmath4 of the cloud , and a linear relationship with metallicity is assumed .",
    "a [ zn / h ] of @xmath8 is applied when metallicity is not known ( standard dla metallicity ) .",
    "as done with the `` milky way '' predicted dib strengths , all of the dib lines are scaled by their relative strengths in the milky way , and the @xmath04428 dib line is further scaled by a factor of 25% .",
    "these results are noted as `` z@xmath9scaled '' in table 1 .",
    "the right panel of figure 1 shows our predictions of the expected @xmath05780 dib strength using eq 2.1 .",
    "the data all lie above the 1:1 correlation line . to find",
    "if metallicity is responsible for the dib deficiency we require additional data to adequately constrain our limits .",
    "there are several potential scenarios that can inhibit dib strength in dlas .",
    "if dib strength scales with metallicity , we would expect to detect them with higher s / n data .",
    "perhaps the ionizing radiation field in regions probed by qso sightlines destroy these molecules .",
    "another possibility is that the covering factor of dib absorbing gas is much smaller than the covering factor in dla regions in which case the qso `` pencil - beam '' technique is truly hit or miss .",
    "also , it may be that our dlas are not dusty enough to contain dibs . in conclusion ,",
    "placing dib absorbers on a substantial statistical footing may be a difficult goal to realize , and using dib strengths as a proxy for @xmath4 to find intermediate redshift dlas does not hold much promise .",
