    "as reviewed in @xcite , various kinds of phenomena have been recognized as stochastic resonance phenomena ( sr ) and have been studies with a variety of methods@xcite . among theoretical models for sr , the simplest is that described by the langevin dynamics of a particle confined in a double - well potential periodically deformed by an oscillating external field , @xmath0 where , @xmath1 the last term of which indicates the oscillating external field .",
    "hereafter , we call the above model as the original sr model .    to quantify the efficiency of sr , the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , the spectral power amplification ( spa ) and other quantities have been proposed .",
    "according to recent relating studies@xcite , here , we employ spa as the index of sr .",
    "spa is , roughly , the power ratio between the input and the output signals , and is defined as , @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 represent the frequency of the input signal , power spectrums of input and output signals , respectively .",
    "the denominator means the power of the input signal ( sinusoidal wave ) , and the numerator is the corresponding power of the output signal . here",
    ", @xmath6 is taken to be larger than the peak width of the power spectrum . in our simulation ,",
    "considering the resolution of the numerical fourier transformation , ( [ spa ] ) is approximated by @xmath7    a series of efforts to obtain the higher spa or snr have been conducted through variations of the original sr model , one of which was made by coupling two particles applied in a common double - well potential periodically deformed by the external field as described by ( [ 2 ] ) . through the reasonable tuning of coupling strength ,",
    "this coupled particles model gives a higher snr than the original sr model@xcite . as another directional variation ,",
    "cascade dynamics using one - way coupling between oscillating sub - systems was simulated@xcite , that exhibits a high synchronization to the oscillating external field by adding a proper amplitude of noise even below hopf bifurcation threshold .",
    "note that most of the previous models of sr have treated systems in which constituent elements are exposed to equivalent amplitude of noise , whereas a few models have considered the heterogeneous , i.e. , element dependent , amplitudes of noise . as discussed in one of such models@xcite",
    ", the noise emerging in a living cell is not always equivalent through the cell because the origin of noise in living systems is , in addition to the thermal fluctuation , the local density fluctuation of reacting molecules in each cell .",
    "therefore , as one way for revising the preceding sr models considering at the time the potential comparison to actual systems , we study sr model of coupled two elements exposed to the heterogeneous amplitude of noise , restricting the model as simple as possible to focus only on the basic mechanism of the underlying system .",
    "the present model is described as , @xmath8 \\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial x_2}{\\partial t } = -\\frac{\\partial v(x_2)}{\\partial x_2 } + k(x_1-x_2)+\\xi_2(t ) , \\label{1 } \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is same as ( [ 2 ] ) , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 is coupling constant . the quantities",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 are gaussian white noise with the relations , @xmath16    it should be notified that noise amplitudes @xmath17 and @xmath18 are _ independently _ varied as a set of control parameters .",
    "we numerically calculate ( [ 1 ] ) and measure spa for respective particles with varying a set of parameters @xmath19 .",
    "the numerical integration is carried out using the 4th order runge - kutta method for deterministic part and the euler - maruyama scheme for stochastic part with time mesh @xmath20 .",
    "all data are taken as the ensemble averages of @xmath21 simulations with each run performed from @xmath22 to @xmath23 under the randomly chosen initial conditions of @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) , where we take away the dynamics from @xmath22 to @xmath26 to avoid the dependence to initial conditions . in the following ,",
    "we show the numerical outcomes .",
    "specifically , spa of particle 1 named spa1 , and the average spa of two particles named aspa=(spa1+spa2)/2 , are focused on .",

    "if coupling strength is weaker than a critical value , the equivalent amplitude of noise still gives the largest aspa as seen in fig.[aspa1](c ) . on the other hand , as shown in fig.[aspa1](d ) ( and its enlarged view fig.[aspa1](e ) ) for a stronger coupling ( @xmath38 ) with @xmath36 , the peaks of aspa in @xmath34 space are definitely located @xmath45 the equivalent amplitude line of noise .",

    "namely , the resonance effect of particle 1 is strong enough to overcome the poor resonance of particle 2 in this case of slow oscillation ( @xmath63 ) of external field . in such way , heterogeneous amplitude of noise leads the system in a certain range of conditions , not only locally but also in the average of the whole , to an effective sr .",

    "to understand the mechanism of the present effective sr of coupled two particles under heterogeneous amplitude of noise , we analytically treat the simplified transient dynamics among finite number of states using a master equation ; @xmath67 where @xmath68 represents the state in which particle @xmath69 is at the left minima ( @xmath70 ) or the right minima ( @xmath71 ) of the potential expressed by ( 2 ) ( @xmath72 ) .",

    "as long as looking the contours of aspa , qualitative features of fig.[aspa1](a)-(d ) obtained by the simulation of langevin dynamics model ( 5 ) seems to be reproduced by the analytical solution of master equation ( 7 ) .",
    "however some remarkable aspects of the heterogeneous sr are not sufficiently described by the present form of master equation model as discussed in the followings .",

    "the effect of the heterogeneous amplitude of noise exceeds that of equivalent noise as @xmath13 increases .",
    "these features shown in fig.6 especially for @xmath90 reflect the qualitative characters obtained by langevin dynamics model ( fig.2 ) for the same @xmath13 range .",
    "however , it should be cared in fig.6(b ) , that the effect of heterogeneous amplitude of noise is not sharp enough to make the second mound of the max - aspa graph shown in fig.2(b ) of langevin dynamics model , nor the overlap of @xmath17 and @xmath18 in fig.2(b ) giving max - aspa for large @xmath13 is recognized in fig.6(b ) .",
    "moreover the dominant region of heterogeneous sr for large @xmath13 in fig.6(a ) has no counterpart in fig.2(a ) .",
    "these distinctions between behaviors of the langevin dynamics model and the master equation model would partially originate from the assumption of weak coupling limit as mentioned in the previous section",
    ". however the more intrinsic origin for this distinction seems linked to the basic mechanism of the present heterogeneous sr as explained below ;    if we rewrite the langevin dynamics of ( 5 ) like , @xmath91 \\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial x_2}{\\partial t } = -\\frac{\\partial v_{\\rm{eff}}(x_1.x_2)}{\\partial x_2}+\\xi_2(t ) , \\label{1 - 2 } \\end{array}\\ ] ] an overall effective potential @xmath92 for particles 1 and 2 is , + @xmath93 if we take @xmath94 as constant in the above form , an effective potential of particle 1 becomes monostable above a critical coupling strength @xmath95 that depends on @xmath96 and @xmath94 .",
    "then the signal and the coupling force act in the same direction if @xmath97 , @xmath98 ( or if @xmath99 and @xmath100 ) , supposing coupling strength satisfies @xmath101 , in which case the signal is superthreshold .",
    "this means that particle 1 will move quickly into the single minimum ( if it is not already there ) without surmounting a potential barrier .",
    "noise is not necessary for this transition of particle 1 . on the other hand",
    ", particle 2 should be sufficiently noisy to trigger the monostable potential for particle 1 .",
    "in particular , the mean escape time of particle 2 should be much smaller than half the period of the signal . in this case ,",
    "particle 1 can exhibit essentially a classical ( i.e. , deterministic ) resonance , which results in a large aspa at unequal noise amplitudes . in the present simulation of langevin dynamics model , the critical coupling strength @xmath95 is estimated as @xmath102 using the specific values of parameters : @xmath103 .    this scenario explains the split of max - aspa graphs over @xmath104 in fig.2(b ) , one is max - aspa within whole @xmath34 space and the other is that on @xmath31 line .",
    "also @xmath95 is close to the initiating point of the right - side mound of max - aspa in the same figure .",
    "moreover , it should be noted that , in the limit @xmath105 , max - aspa in @xmath34 space degenerates on a line @xmath106= constant , causing the vanishment of heterogeneous sr in this limit , which is reflected in fig.2(b ) as the rejoining of @xmath17 and @xmath18 at large @xmath13 accompanied with the rejoining of max - aspa values in whole @xmath34 space and along @xmath31 line in the same figure .",
    "to summarize , we numerically showed that the efficiency of sr is enhanced by the coupling of bistable elements exposed to heterogeneous amplitude of noise .",
    "this heterogeneous sr is caused through a task allocation between two particles such that one particle ( particle 2 ) under large fluctuation easily jumps over the potential barrier and pulls another particle(particle 1 ) to the potential minimum state keeping itself under a large fluctuation , then only the latter ( particle 1 ) directly contributes to the heterogeneous sr . therefore if we focus only on the sr of particle 1 , it is found that the present mechanism works for a wide range in @xmath13 ( coupling strength ) and @xmath3 ( frequency of external signal ) as seen in fig.4 , where the maximum value of spa1 , an sr index of particle 1 , is marked under heterogeneous amplitude of noise in almost all range of @xmath13 in the graph .    however , the most noticeable in the present study is that the effect of heterogeneous sr is largely pronounced when coupling strength between two particles exceeds a critical value and the external signal for particle 1 reaches super - threshold level with the help of highly fluctuating particle 2 . in that case",
    "not only spa1 ; an index of sr of particle 1 , but also aspa ; an index of averages degree of sr of particles 1 and 2 , mark the maximum value at each-@xmath13 under heterogeneous amplitude of noise .    in this way ,",
    "the present heterogeneous sr is an outcome of an exquisite combination of the triggering particle with a large fluctuation and the following particle which faithfully responds to the external signal under small ( or zero ) amplitude of noise .",
    "we suppose that the heterogeneous sr has potential applicability to a wider variety of stochastic resonance phenomena like those of devising artificial sensors with high susceptibility@xcite , and that it has a certain connection to the basic study on the function of non - isothermal multi - elements systems@xcite .",
    "this study was supported by grant - in - aid ( 19654056 , 22540391 ) for scientific research , and , the global coe program g14 ( formation and development of mathematical sciences based on modeling and analysis ) of jsps .",
    "in this appendix , we analytically derive the time evolution of the expectation values of @xmath107 treated in ( 7 ) . for simplification",
    "we assume @xmath108 . from equation ( 7 )",
    ", we obtain the dynamics for the expectation values , @xmath109 where @xmath110 and @xmath111 . to solve the equation , we assume that input signal is sufficiently weak ( @xmath112 ) , then",
    ", the correlation function @xmath113 has even parity with respect to @xmath77 .",
    "consequently , only the zeroth order term in @xmath77 remains in this correlation in the linear approximation .",
