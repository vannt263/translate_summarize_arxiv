    "an important theme in quantum mechanics is to find a relation between a global geometry of a sample ( _ e.g. _ , boundary conditions ) and its physical properties .",
    "we address this issue by comparing flux periodicity of persistent currents in a cylinder and in a mbius strip .",
    "the aim is to determine whether the geometrical ( in some sense topological ) difference is tangible and experimentally observable . at zero temperature ,",
    "the persistent current @xmath0 in a ring can be expressed as@xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the magnetic flux threading the ring in units of @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the ground state energy , and @xmath5 are the current harmonics .",
    "the current @xmath0 is an anti - symmetric and periodic function of @xmath2 with period  1 .",
    "possible occurrence of smaller flux periodicity in mesoscopic physics is one of the cornerstones of weak localization . for the cylinder geometry , conductance measurements@xcite and magnetization of @xmath6 copper rings@xcite",
    "indicate the emergence of periodicity @xmath7 . it is shown to be intimately related to the procedure of _ averaging _ over disorder realizations and numbers of electrons in the rings@xcite .",
    "very recently , a microscopic nbse@xmath8 mbius strip has been fabricated@xcite .",
    "obviously , in this case , attention should be focused on a _ single sample _",
    "measurement@xcite for which there is no self - averaging .    let us first mention several intuitive points relevant to the flux periodicity in the mbius strip , based on semi - classical arguments and geometry@xcite . first , recall that the periodicity is related to interference between trajectories ( such as aharonov - bohm interference between different trajectories or weak - localization interference between time - reversed paths ) . in the cylinder ( mbius )",
    "geometry , an electron moving in the _ longitudinal direction _ along the ring encircles the system once ( _ twice _ ) before returning to its initial position .",
    "therefore , we might expect different flux periodicities of the persistent current between the two cases .",
    "second , unlike a cylinder which can be pressed   into a one - dimensional ring , the mbius strip can not be pressed into a one - dimensional structure .",
    "this brings in another important factor , namely , the motion of electrons in the _ transverse _ direction . in a tight - binding model this motion is controlled by the transverse hopping .",
    "if it is very weak , the twice - encircling property of the mbius strip implies the dominance of even harmonics @xmath9 .",
    "contrary , for a strong transverse hopping , the current in the mbius strip is expected to be effectively similar to that in the cylindrical strip@xcite . in the following we are mainly interested in a regime where the transverse hopping is slightly less than with the longitudinal one .",
    "third , the role of disorder should be carefully examined .",
    "weak disorder is not expected to significantly alter interference between semi - classical trajectories discussed above , while strong disorder should result in a reduced sensitivity to the pertinent geometry , due to localization effects .",
    "the most intriguing disorder effect might then be expected in a moderate strength of disorder which will be used below .",
    "the upshot of the present study is that the periodicity pattern in a mbius strip is remarkably distinct from that of a cylinder , and that disorder plays a crucial role in making the statistical effect detectable .",
    "a mbius strip is modelled by considering a non - interacting particle in a rectangle of length @xmath10 and width @xmath11 , requiring its wave - function @xmath12 to satisfy dirichlet boundary conditions in the @xmath13 direction , and mbius boundary conditions @xcite in the @xmath14 direction : @xmath15 the quantized wave - numbers are @xmath16 and @xmath17_{n_{y}}+n_x)$ ] , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the notation @xmath20_{n}$ ] represents @xmath21 for @xmath22 and @xmath23 for @xmath24 . in the cylinder geometry ,",
    "( 3 ) should be replaced by @xmath25 , and gives @xmath26 .",
    "thus , only the @xmath27 eigenstates are affected by the switch from the conventional cylinder ( periodic ) boundary conditions to the mbius ones .    in the absence of disorder ,",
    "the energies of the eigenstates both in the mbius and cylinder strips are given by the formula @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 provide the dispersion relation .",
    "equation ( [ enxny ] ) is rather general for clean systems . to be more specific ,",
    "let us model the mbius strip by a tight - binding hamiltonian .",
    "the mbius strip is constructed from a rectangular lattice including @xmath31 sites .",
    "the rectangle is twisted by @xmath32 , and its two sides are connected , such that longitudinal wire @xmath33 is attached to wire @xmath34 , wire @xmath35 is attached to wire @xmath36 and so on .",
    "the mbius strip so constructed includes @xmath37 longitudinal wires with @xmath38 sites on each one .",
    "the hamiltonian is then @xmath39 \\nonumber",
    "\\\\ \\hspace*{0.5 cm } - t_{2 } \\sum_{n=1}^{2n } \\sum_{m=1}^{m-1}c^{\\dagger}_{nm+1 } c_{nm } - \\frac{t_{2}}{2 } \\sum_{n=1}^{2n}c^{\\dagger}_{nm } c_{n+nm } + \\text{h.c . } \\hspace*{0.5 cm } \\label{hm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the fermion operator at the site @xmath41 ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) and @xmath44 and @xmath45 are longitudinal and transverse hopping amplitudes respectively .",
    "the quantity @xmath46 is the site energy .",
    "connecting the two sides of the rectangle without twisting , we obtain a cylindrical strip which includes @xmath34 longitudinal wires composed of @xmath47 sites .",
    "the hamiltonian of the cylinder is @xmath48 \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\hspace*{0.5 cm } - t_{2 } \\sum_{n=1}^{n } \\sum_{m=1}^{2m-1}c^{\\dagger}_{nm+1 } c_{nm } + \\text{h.c . } \\hspace*{3.0 cm } \\label{hc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] locally the two hamiltonians ( [ hm ] ) and ( [ hc ] ) look the same .",
    "but there is a couple of essential differences between them : a ) the mbius hamiltonian ( [ hm ] ) includes an extra term which describes long range hopping between distant parts of the @xmath37th wire @xcite .",
    "b ) while the magnetic phase accumulated along the longitudinal direction on each link is the same ( that is , @xmath49 ) , the corresponding number of links is different ( @xmath38 for the mbius strip and @xmath47 for the cylinder ) .",
    "we first consider a system without disorder , namely , @xmath50 .",
    "the dispersion relation for an electron in the mbius strip reads , @xmath51_{n_{y } } + n_x-\\phi\\right)\\bigg ] \\nonumber \\\\ & - & 2t_2 \\cos \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2m{+}1 } n_y \\right)\\ , \\label{enxny1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 and @xmath53 . defining new indexes @xmath54_{n_{y}}+2n_{x}$ ] and @xmath55_{k}+n_{y}/2 $ ]",

    "it is instructive to compare it with the energy in the cylinder geometry , @xmath59 -2t_2 \\cos \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2m+1 } q \\right)$ ] , where @xmath60 and @xmath61 . despite the apparent similarity between these two spectra",
    ", there are at least two important differences .",
    "first , the combination of flux and longitudinal momentum is distinct , namely , it is @xmath62 for the cylinder and @xmath63 for the mbius strip . for",
    "a small ratio @xmath64 this might affect the periodicity of the current@xcite .",
    "second , the mini - band structure is different .    th-@xmath65th energy levels are shown .",
    "the parameters are @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 .",
    "energies are measured in units of @xmath44 . ]",
    "we now turn to elucidate the current in disordered mbius strips .",
    "the random numbers @xmath46 are assumed to be uniformly distributed over the range @xmath70 , where @xmath71 represents the strength of disorder . the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ hm ] ) [ or eq .  ( [ hc ] ) ]",
    "is treated numerically . as an example , the evolution of single - particle energies with flux in a disordered mbius strip with @xmath66 and @xmath67 is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the parameters are @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the pattern of avoided crossing turns out to be remarkably different from that for a cylinder ( see ref .",
    "5 figure 1 therein ) .",
    "it must then be reflected in the behavior of persistent currents .     and",
    "@xmath67.,width=302 ]    the first stage of the analysis is an inspection of the typical values of @xmath5 , aiming in determination of their dependence on the ratio @xmath64 .",
    "as expected , in the absence of averaging we find typical @xmath74 dominance in case of the cylinder geometry irrespective of the @xmath64 ratio .",
    "for the mbius geometry the emerging picture is quite different .",
    "figure 2 shows the fourier components of the persistent current for a clean mbius strip as a function of the ratio @xmath75 at and below the half - filling ( @xmath76 ) . for small ratios ( @xmath77 )",
    "we find , as can be naively expected , @xmath78 dominance .",
    "the expected effect of averaging in the cylinder case is to emphasize the @xmath78 contribution , while in the mbius case the expected effect is to emphasize the @xmath79 contribution . for clean mbius strip the @xmath80 with odd @xmath81 , as",
    "a function of the number of electrons @xmath82 , is anti - symmetric around half - filling .",
    "therefore @xmath83 and @xmath84 completely vanish [ fig .",
    "see further discussionin sect .",
    "v. to avoid this particularity at the half - filling , we display in fig .",
    "2(b ) also the case where the number of electrons ( @xmath85 ) is below half - filling . for large ratios ( @xmath86 )",
    "we observe in fig .",
    "2(b ) a cylinder - like regime where there is typically @xmath74 dominance .",
    "this is because the strong transverse hopping changes the periodicity of the mbius strip to that of the conventional cylinder .",
    "the somewhat unexpected observation is that there is a distinct wide intermediate regime ( @xmath87 ) where @xmath74 , @xmath78 , @xmath88 and @xmath79 are all comparable .",
    "this is the regime which is of experimental relevance .",
    "the expected effect of averaging in this regime is to emphasize both the @xmath78 and the @xmath79 contributions .",
    "the problem arising in the analysis of persistent currents in disordered mbius strips is how to characterize the statistics of the calculated data .",
    "it was already pointed out that essential properties of observables result from the averaging procedure and the nature of the underlying statistical ensemble @xcite . on the other hand , fabrication of a mbius strip",
    "requires an outstanding effort@xcite , and hence , anticipated measurements of the persistent current would probably be performed on a single sample . thus , somewhat unfortunately , the important results reported therein and the powerful calculation methods based on super - symmetry might be less useful for _ single - sample _ experiments since there is no averaging .    what is then the most efficient way to present our calculated results ?",
    "the answer is provided by elementary statistics .",
    "an experimental result consists of a set of @xmath89 measurements @xmath90 , @xmath91 performed on a given sample .",
    "this sample is taken out of an ensemble of mbius strips with different disorder realizations , electron numbers @xmath82 , aspect ratios , _",
    "etc_. the set @xmath92 can be regarded as an instance of a random vector in a @xmath89 dimensional space .",
    "alternatively , this instance can be represented by the current harmonics @xmath93 defined via eq .",
    "( [ iphi ] ) . for our purpose",
    "it seems adequate to keep only the first 4  harmonics .",
    "the relevant statistical ensemble is then a set of points  @xmath94 in four - dimensional probability space , each point corresponds to a possible experimental measurement of the current on the _ entire _ @xmath2 interval .",
    "let us denote the number of points within an infinitesimal four - dimensional volume element by @xmath95 .",
    "the distribution function @xmath96 is normalized to @xmath97 , the total number of members in the ensemble .",
    "the most probable ( typical ) experimental result is then determined by the quadruple @xmath98 at which @xmath96 is maximal .",
    "another quantity , which seems more informative and easy to analyze , is the distribution @xmath99 this corresponds to the possibility of finding a sample whose current @xmath0 is approximately described by @xmath100 .",
    "( for a sample counted by @xmath101 , all the harmonics other than @xmath80 are at most half of @xmath80 in magnitude ) .",
    "the number of members in the ensemble that exhibit @xmath5 dominance is therefore @xmath102 . if @xmath103 for any @xmath104 , the typical periodicity of @xmath0 is dominantly @xmath105 .",
    "( @xmath106 ) defined by eq .  ( [ pn ] ) for the cylinder and mbius ensembles .",
    "the numbers of members with @xmath5 dominance are @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 for the cylinder ensemble , and @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 for the mbius ensemble . ]    in actual calculations , we assume that the lattice structure , the aspect ratio , and the strength of disorder are fixed , and that the temperature is very low",
    ". then , two quantities are still fluctuating , namely , the filling factor ( or the electron number @xmath82 ) and the specific realization of disorder .",
    "we generate an ensemble of @xmath115 members corresponding to @xmath116 consecutive values of @xmath82 , usually around half filling , and @xmath117 realizations of disorder for each one of them .",
    "actually , for our systems of size @xmath66 , @xmath67 with @xmath118 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 , we take @xmath119 , hence @xmath120 and @xmath121 , so that @xmath122 .",
    "the distributions @xmath101 for the cylinder and mbius ensembles are shown in fig .",
    "the most striking result that can be deduced from fig .  3 is the essential reduction of @xmath123 for the mbius ensemble compared with the cylinder one . for the present ratio @xmath124",
    ", there is also a strong tendency towards @xmath125 periodicity , since @xmath126 for the mbius ensemble .",
    "this result is intriguing , because here we have no averaging procedure which is crucial to get the @xmath7 periodicity in cylindrical strips .",
    "however , this @xmath127 periodicity emerges only for the specific ratio @xmath124 .",
    "we have calculated the distributions @xmath128 for mbius strips with several aspect ratios .",
    "the value of @xmath129 depends on the aspect ratio .",
    "no specific @xmath81 gives prominent @xmath129 independently of the aspect ratio . on the other hand ,",
    "the collapse of @xmath83 dominance in the mbius ensemble is robust and persists in systems with different ratios @xmath130 as well .",
    "we can safely say that @xmath123 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 become all comparable in the mbius ensemble .     and @xmath134 as a function of @xmath82 for the ordered ( solid line ) and disordered ( dots ) systems .",
    "parameters describing the systems are the same with those for fig .",
    "3.,width=321 ]    the natural question that comes to mind is whether this result is a consequence of the mbius geometry or , rather , it is due to the presence of disorder . in order to answer this question ,",
    "we have performed the calculation of @xmath135 for a clean  mbius ensemble ( without disorder , only @xmath136 is being changed ) .",
    "we found out that the probability to find any @xmath5 dominance is extremely small .",
    "the immediate conclusion is that disorder is essential for the identification of mbius strips via @xmath137 dominance .",
    "does this mean that interference or weak - localization effects due to the presence of disorder is important ? to clarify this point , we should understand how @xmath135 is modified by disorder .",
    "the distribution @xmath135 is , in fact , a function defined on a one dimensional curve @xmath138 $ ] in @xmath139 space . for this reason ,",
    "it is unlikely to find a sample where one of the @xmath80 is dominant .",
    "the effect of disorder is to give some thickness  to this curve ( see fig .  4 ) .",
    "taking into account that the amplitudes of @xmath140 for mbius strips are all comparable , the thickness gives a finite probability to find samples where one of the @xmath5 is dominant . on the contrary , in the case of cylindrical strips ,",
    "the amplitude of @xmath141 is overwhelmingly larger than those of @xmath142 , which makes it unlikely to find @xmath142 dominated samples even if we take the statistical effect of disorder into account .",
    "we should note here that the function @xmath80 with odd @xmath81 for the clean mbius strip is an even function around the half - filling ( @xmath76 ) and an odd function for odd @xmath81 , while the function @xmath80 for arbitrary @xmath81 is an even function in the cylinder case .",
    "our findings regarding @xmath129 for the mbius ensemble are based on the fact that the amplitudes of @xmath143 are all comparable for mbius strips . as we have observed in fig .  2 , this is a robust statistical property in the intermediate regime @xmath144 .",
    "the choice @xmath72 above , provides typical results for @xmath101 and @xmath129 in case that @xmath75 is within this distinct regime .",
    "we have studied the persistent currents of non - interacting electrons in mbius strips .",
    "the spectral properties for a clean system were found analytically , and the effect of disorder on the currents was analyzed numerically .",
    "we have found that disorder is quite essential for the identification of mbius strips .",
    "the issue of disorder averaging is not relevant for single sample experiments , and hence , special care is required for statistical analysis of the current harmonics .",
    "the fingerprint of the mbius geometry is an enhanced probability to find samples in which @xmath5 , with @xmath145 dominates .",
    "this should be contrasted with the case of cylinder geometry , where there is a clear @xmath83 dominance .",
    "the above assertion regarding the fingerprint of the mbius geometry is correct provided the effect of disorder is properly taken into account .",
    "we would like to thank t. nakayama for very helpful discussions .",
    "one of the authors ( y.a . ) was supported by the invitation fellowship for research in japan ( short term ) of the japan society for the promotion of science .",
    "numerical calculations in this work have been mainly performed on the facilities of the supercomputer center , institute for solid state physics , university of tokyo .                          if , instead of eq .",
    "( 2 ) , we assume the periodic b.c .  in the @xmath13 direction , the mbius b.c .  of eq .  ( 3 ) are modified as @xmath146 .",
    "this leads to a long - range hopping term in eq .",
    "( 5 ) , that does not discriminate   the @xmath37th wire .",
    "yet another possibility is to _ keep _ eq .",
    "this possibility is of _ academic _ interest , since it corresponds to an geometry that can not be embedded in a 3d euclidean space . in the latter case",
    ", there is a symmetry breaking that prevents having a stationary current in the @xmath13 direction ."
