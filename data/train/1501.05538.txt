    "subsequently , the same idea was used to study the crystallization of the @xmath1 one - component plasma ( with @xmath2 interactions ) @xcite , to establish the phase diagram of the @xmath1 coulomb gas @xcite , and to determine some thermodynamic and structural properties of the @xmath1 polar fluid ( with @xmath3 interactions ) in its liquid phase @xcite .",
    "the generalizations to @xmath4 systems , implying the use of the surface of a @xmath5 hypersphere , _",

    "some improvements on this early work , mostly applications concerning @xmath4 polar fluids , were published recently @xcite .",
    "several simple ideas can be put forward to justify the use of a hyperspherical geometry in numerical simulations of plasmas and coulombic fluids ( _ i.e. _ fluids made of ions and/or dipoles ) :    * \\(i ) the @xmath7-dimensional non - euclidian space @xmath8 ( in practice @xmath9 ) , albeit finite , is homogeneous and isotropic , in the sense that it is invariant under the group @xmath10 of the @xmath11 rotations of the euclidian space @xmath12 ; it is thus well suited for the simulation of a fluid phase ( in the bulk ) . *",
    "\\(ii ) the laws of electrostatics can easily be obtained in @xmath8 and the green s function of laplace - beltrami equation ( _ i.e. _ coulomb potential ) is known  @xcite .",
    "it has a very simple analytical expression , tailor - made for numerical evaluations . *",
    "\\(iii ) the inclusion of charged or uncharged walls can easily be done in order to study the structure of liquids , plasmas , or collods at interfaces @xcite    the second point ( ii ) was partly overlooked by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite who used an empirical @xmath1 dipole / dipole interaction , unfortunately _ not _ deduced from a solution of laplace - beltrami equation in @xmath0 , which casts some doubts on the validity of their results concerning the @xmath1 stockmayer fluid , notably those concerning its dielectric properties .",
    "some years after we are now in position to propose in this paper two possible , both rigorously correct , dipole / dipole pair - potentials and to use both of them into actual numerical simulations of a @xmath1 dipolar hard sphere ( dhs ) fluid . here , not only we extend to @xmath0 the recent developments on @xmath4 polar fluids in @xmath6 discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , but we also present additional new results on multipolar expansions in @xmath0 , not yet available in @xmath13 , in sec .  [ electrostatics ] .",
    "this article is thus a contribution to the physics of @xmath1 fluids , collods or plasmas , the atoms or molecules of which interact _ via _ electrostatic pair potentials derived from a solution of the @xmath1 laplace equation .",
    "we emphasize that the systems that we consider can not be seen as thin layers of real @xmath4 systems . in this case , the electrostatic interactions should be derived from the solutions of the @xmath4 laplace equation .",
    "simulations of such @xmath4 systems constrained to live in a @xmath1 geometry are nevertheless also possible in spherical geometries . in that case one should consider a @xmath4 fluid of @xmath6 made of particles interacting by pair potentials deduced from solutions of laplace - beltrami equation in @xmath6 and constrained to stay on the equator of the hypersphere .",

    "our aim is to demonstate the validity of the sphere @xmath0 to perform monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of a @xmath1 polar fluid .",

    "therefore , in @xmath0 , the building brick of electrostatics can not be a single point charge @xmath15 as in the ordinary @xmath1 euclidian space @xmath16 .",

    "these two types of models are then studied in the framework of fulton s theory  @xcite in sec .",
    "[ 2d - polar - fluid ] .",
    "fulton s theory realizes a harmonious synthesis of linear response theory and the macroscopic theory of dielectric media .",
