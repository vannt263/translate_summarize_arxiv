    "the time evolution and the nature of the resulting non - equilibrium stationary states ( ness ) of systems in contact , at their boundaries , with thermal reservoirs at different temperatures remains a challenging problem .",
    "the only such systems with bulk hamiltonian dynamics for which ness are known are harmonic crystals @xcite .",
    "these are described by specifying the positions and momenta of the oscillators , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "the hamiltonian for a @xmath7 chain ( with obvious extension to @xmath8 ) is given by @xmath9 = \\sum_{j=0}^{n+1 } { { { \\mathcal e}}}_j\\ ] ] where we have set the mass of each particle and the nearest neighbor coupling equal to @xmath3 .",
    "we impose boundary conditions @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "the strength of the pinning potential is regulated by the parameter @xmath12 .",
    "this system is put in contact with thermal reservoirs at temperatures @xmath1 at site @xmath3 and @xmath2 at site @xmath0 via the ornstein - uhlenbeck ( langevin ) process .    in the absence of any stochastic bulk noise",
    "the heat flux in the non - equilibrium stationary state is independent of @xmath0 , corresponding to the heat conductivity diverging linearly in @xmath0 @xcite . to imitate the effects of interactions between phonons and to produce ness with normal transport one may add bulk noise to the system @xcite@xcite .",
    "the new ness will , we expect , exhibit certain universal features also present in realistic anharmonic systems . it is the purpose of this note to summarize some new results about such systems . a more detailed analysis will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we shall now consider two ways of adding noise to the system .",
    "the first case we consider is the so - called self - consistent model @xcite .",
    "each site @xmath13 is connected to a langevin reservoir at temperature @xmath14 .",
    "the temperatures of the reservoirs at the boundary sites are fixed by the conditions @xmath15 , while the temperatures of the interior site reservoirs are determined self - consistently by requiring that in the ness there is no net flux of energy between the system and the interior reservoirs .    the second model we consider is one in which we add in the bulk flip dynamics which consists of reversing the velocity of each particle at random independent poissonian times . these flips are energy but not momentum conserving and we call the model the velocity flip model @xcite",
    ".    let @xmath16 be the probability density of our system at time @xmath17 .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath18 is described by the fokker - planck equation @xmath19 \\nonumber \\\\    & = & \\sum_{\\alpha=1,n } \\gamma \\frac{\\partial } { \\partial p_{\\alpha}}\\left [ p_{\\alpha } \\mu + t_{\\alpha } \\frac{\\partial \\mu}{\\partial p_{\\alpha } } \\right ] + \\sum_{k } b_{k , b } \\mu    \\label{eq : fp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 represents the bulk noise with @xmath21 for the velocity - flip and @xmath22 for the self - consistent case : @xmath23\\ , ,   \\nonumber \\\\    b_{k,{\\rm s } }   \\mu & = &    \\gamma \\frac{\\partial } { \\partial p_{k}}\\left [ p_{k } \\mu + t_{k } \\frac{\\partial \\mu}{\\partial p_{k } } \\right ] ,   \\quad { k=2,\\ldots , n-1}.   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the ness of the two models , denoted by @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively , are solutions of ( [ eq : fp ] ) with , for the self - consistent model , @xmath26 ,  @xmath27 , determined by the self - consistency condition @xmath28",
    ".    if the temperatures @xmath1 and @xmath2 are equal to a common value @xmath29 , the steady state of the self - consistent chain and the steady state of the velocity flip model are both equal to the gibbs state with temperature @xmath29 that we denote by @xmath30 .",
    "this is a gaussian measure with covariance @xmath31 . for @xmath32 ,",
    "the ness of the two models are different .",
    "however , it is easy to see that both stationary states are centered , and by the results derived in @xcite , we know that the two point correlation functions of both models coincide , when the rate of flipping and the coupling to the internal reservoirs are the same . nevertheless , the two measures are very different : @xmath25 is gaussian but @xmath24 is a non - trivial mixture of gaussian states .",
    "this has a simple non - trivial consequence : if @xmath33 is a linear function of the form @xmath34 where @xmath35 are arbitrary real numbers , then @xmath36 ^ 2 = { \\langle f^4 \\rangle_{\\text{s , s}}}\\ , .\\ ] ] this follows from the fact that for a centered gaussian measure @xmath37 ^ 2 $ ] , and @xmath38 is a superposition of such measures .",
    "both models satisfy fourier s law with the same value of the conductivity .",
    "indeed , since the microscopic energy current across the bond @xmath39 @xmath40 is a quadratic function of the momenta and positions , its averages over @xmath41 and @xmath38 are equal .",
    "the macroscopic current @xmath42 $ ] , with @xmath43 , is given according to @xcite by @xmath44    the outline of the rest of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec : hl ] we present the macroscopic equations for the density profiles of the bulk conserved quantities in the velocity - flip model . in section [ sec : cor ] we show that long - range energy correlations are present in the velocity - flip model but not in the self - consistent one . section [ sec : num ] contains numerical simulations of these long - range correlations .",
    "we have to distinguish two cases according to whether @xmath45 ( unpinned ) or @xmath46 ( pinned ) .",
    "the unpinned case is similar to that investigated by one of the authors in @xcite .",
    "when @xmath45 the _ bulk _ dynamics conserves two quantities .",
    "the first one is the energy @xmath47 .",
    "the second one is the deformation , @xmath48 of the lattice , with @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "this second conservation law has to be taken into account in the hydrodynamic analysis .    the energy at a site @xmath51 is now given by @xmath52 and @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "to establish the hydrodynamic limits corresponding to the two conservation laws , we look at the process with time scaled by @xmath55 and space scaled by @xmath0 , i.e. , in the diffusive scale @xcite .",
    "assume that initially the process is started with a gibbs local equilibrium measure @xmath56 associated with a macroscopic deformation profile @xmath57 and a macroscopic energy profile @xmath58 : @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the temperature and tension profiles corresponding to the given energy and deformation profiles assumed to be continuous .",
    "then we have for any macroscopic point @xmath62 $ ] @xmath63 } ( 0 ) \\rangle = u_0(q ) , \\quad",
    "\\lim_{n \\to \\infty } \\langle { { { \\mathcal e}}}_{[nq ] } ( 0 ) \\rangle = { \\varepsilon}_0 ( q ) \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath64 $ ] is the integer part of @xmath65 and the averages are w.r.t .  @xmath66 .",
    "the question then is : what happens at any later ( macroscopic ) time @xmath17 ?",
    "it is shown in @xcite that @xmath63 } ( n^2 t ) \\rangle = u(q , t ) , \\quad   \\lim_{n \\to \\infty } \\langle { { { \\mathcal e}}}_{[nq ] } ( n^2 t ) \\rangle = { \\varepsilon } ( q , t ) \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath67 are solutions of the following macroscopic diffusion equation @xmath68 with the initial conditions @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "eq ( [ eq : he ] ) is to be solved subject to the boundary conditions @xmath71 the boundary condition on @xmath72 comes from the fact that the length of the chain remains fixed .",
    "taking the limit @xmath73 in these equations we obtain the typical macroscopic profiles of the system in the ness , i.e. , a flat deformation profile @xmath74 and a linear profile @xmath75 interpolating between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , @xmath76 for the energy profile .",
    "assume that the system is initially distributed according to a gibbs local equilibrium measure associated to the energy profile @xmath77 $ ] , and define @xmath78 as the evolved profile in the diffusive scale , i.e. , @xmath79 } ( t n^2 ) \\rangle \\ , .\\ ] ] then @xmath80 is the solution of the following heat equation @xmath81 the conductivity @xmath82 , which is independent of the temperature , is given by ( [ eq : k ] ) .",
    "when @xmath17 goes to infinity @xmath83 converges to the linear profile @xmath84 ( given in ( [ eq : bt ] ) ) both for the velocity - flip and the self - consistent model .",
    "we note finally that , since the self - consistent model does not conserve energy in the bulk , we do not expect any autonomous macroscopic equations in that model .",
    "our goal is to estimate the probability that in the stationary state the empirical energy profile , @xmath85 , defined by looking at the microscopic energy @xmath86 , for @xmath87 equal to the integer part of @xmath88 , is close to a prescribed macroscopic energy profile @xmath89 different from @xmath84 , i.e. , we want to find the large deviation function ( ldf ) for the ness .    at equilibrium @xmath90",
    "the stationary state @xmath41 coincides with the usual gibbs equilibrium measure @xmath91 and by the usual large deviations theory ( see e.g.  @xcite ) we have that for any given macroscopic energy profile @xmath92 @xmath93 where the large deviation function ( ldf ) @xmath94 dq\\ ] ] coincides with the difference between the free energy of the system in local thermal equilibrium ( lte ) and the true equilibrium free energy with @xmath95 .    out of equilibrium ( @xmath32 )",
    "there is also a large deviation principle @xcite @xmath96 but the explicit form of @xmath97 is in general unknown .",
    "what is true however , is that v depends only on two macroscopic quantities : the heat conductivity and the mobility @xcite .    for the system we are interested in ,",
    "the conductivity @xmath98 is given by ( [ eq : k ] ) and is independent of @xmath29 . by the einstein relation the mobility @xmath99 is equal to @xmath100",
    "where @xmath101 is the static compressibility defined by the equilibrium correlation @xmath102 a simple computation shows that for our system @xmath103 and theorem 6.5 of @xcite applies .",
    "it follows that @xmath104 is given by @xmath105\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath106 is the unique increasing solution of @xmath107 surprisingly , the function @xmath97 is independent of the pinning value @xmath108 and of the intensity of the noise @xmath109 . in fact , it coincides with the ldf of the kipnis - marchioro - presutti ( kmp ) model considered in @xcite . in that model",
    "the dynamics are entirely stochastic .",
    "it is now easy to derive the gaussian fluctuations of the empirical energy .",
    "we consider a small perturbation , @xmath110 , of the stationary profile @xmath111 .",
    "the functional @xmath97 has a minimum at @xmath112 so that @xmath113 the operator @xmath114 is the covariance for the gaussian fluctuations of the empirical energy under the invariant measure @xmath115 .",
    "the computations are the same as in @xcite and we get @xmath116 where @xmath117 denotes the laplacian with dirichlet boundary conditions on @xmath118 $ ] .      for the unpinned case , we are not able to obtain the expression of the ldf of the two conserved quantities nor for the energy alone .",
    "we conjecture that the ldf for the energy is the same for the pinned and unpinned case .",
    "moreover , we are able ( under suitable assumptions ) to show that , in the unpinned case , ( [ eq : corr ] ) is still valid @xcite .",
    "we show in @xcite that the energy correlations in the ness of a self - consistent chain are not long range in the sense that the variance of the total energy divided by @xmath0 is given by the lte measure .",
    "the remainder is ( at least ) of order @xmath119 in the pinned case and @xmath120 in the unpinned case .",
    "energy fluctuations are thus dominated by the local equilibrium term . moreover , in the pinned chain the ness is reached exponentially fast on a microscopic time - scale . therefore , the energy profile is then given by the linear equilibrium profile for all macroscopic times .",
    "we have performed numerical simulations in the velocity - flip model , both with and without bulk pinning . in these simulations , the initial position and momentum of each particle",
    "was chosen randomly , from a centered uniform distribution in the intervals[@xmath121 and [ @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 is the interparticle harmonic potential , and we have set @xmath125 and @xmath126 ( the mass and boltzmann s constant respectively ) . the numerical solution to the dynamics was carried out by choosing a small step @xmath127 , and at each step updating the position and momentum of the particles first according to the hamiltonian evolution , then for the heat baths , and finally taking into account the velocity flips .",
    "the solution to the hamiltonian part was obtained by performing an euler integration , implemented through the velocity - verlet algorithm .",
    "a numerical approximation was used to determine the white - noise forces for the langevin heat baths , and a standard scheme was implemented to generate the poisson processes for the velocity flips at every site .",
    "the state of the system was judged to be sufficiently close to the steady state when the currents @xmath128 were essentially constant throughout the chain .",
    "the total energy @xmath129 is given by ( [ eq : energy ] ) , and our goal is to estimate numerically its total fluctuations , by measuring the observable @xmath130 using equation ( [ eq : corr ] ) the measured fluctuations in the total energy should be given by @xmath131 where @xmath132 ^ 2}$ ] is the value we would obtain by a local equilibrium approximation , and @xmath133 ^ 2}$ ] is the correction due to the long - range correlations .",
    "the prefactor @xmath134 is obtained by integrating over @xmath135 .",
    "computing the remaining explicit integrals yields then @xmath136    to get good statistics , several realizations of the initial data were considered .",
    "the results from numerical simulations for the variation in total energy , denoted by @xmath137 , are collected in tables [ table : unpinned ] and [ table : pinned ] .",
    "these results are compared with the theoretical estimate , @xmath138 , and with @xmath139 .",
    "we see that there is a very close match between the predicted @xmath138 and the measured values .",
    "the ness for the self - consistent crystal with coordinates @xmath140 , with thermal reservoirs with temperatures @xmath141 ( @xmath2 ) in contact with all oscillators having values @xmath142 and periodic boundary condition in the transverse directions was solved in @xcite . as shown in @xcite",
    "this has the same covariances as the corresponding velocity flip model .",
    "in particular the heat conductivity @xmath82 is given by @xmath143^{d-1 } } \\frac{d^{d-1 } { \\bf y}}{2+\\tilde{\\nu}({\\bf y})^2 + \\sqrt{\\tilde{\\nu}({\\bf y})^2 ( 4 + \\tilde{\\nu}({\\bf y})^2 ) } } \\label{eq : hdk}\\ ] ] where @xmath144 . the same argument which gives @xmath24 as a superposition of gaussians in 1d also holds in @xmath145 .",
    "the hydrodynamical equation for the pinned velocity flip case will again be that of the form ( [ eq : phd ] ) @xmath146 where @xmath82 is given by ( [ eq : hdk ] ) .",
