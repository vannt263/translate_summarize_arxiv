    "we present the arecibo dual - beam survey ( adbs ) , a  blind \" 21 cm survey for galaxies . ",
    "blind \" hi surveys provide a look at galaxy populations that is unbiased by stellar populations .",
    "many previous searches have tried to determine whether there is a hidden population of hi - rich galaxies .",
    "they have looked in voids ( szomoru _ etal . _  1996 , hulsbosch 1987 , krumm & brosch 1984 ) in clusters ( banks _ etal . _  1999 ,",
    "etal._1994 , weinberg _ etal . _  1991 ) , in groups ( kraan - korteweg _ etal .",
    "_  1999 , haynes & roberts 1979 , and lo & sargent 1979 ) and at random directions in the sky ( kilborn _ etal .",
    "_  1999 , spitzak & schneider 1998 , zwaan _ etal .",
    "_  1997 , henning 1992 , fisher & tully 1981 ) .",
    "these surveys have not been able to convincingly determine the nature of the population of low hi - mass galaxies .",
    "etal._(1997 ) and spitzak & schneider ( 1998 ) undertook  blind \" hi surveys , similar to the one discussed here , but neither had enough low mass sources to make a strong claim about the shape of the mass function .",
    "_  ( 1998 ) combined the two data sets and found evidence for a rise in the number of low mass sources , but the results are not definitive .",
    "the hipass survey , with its coverage of the entire southern sky , should also contribute to our understanding of the hi mass function .",
    "the most recently published mass function contains 263 galaxies , comparable to the number in this survey ( kilborn _ etal . _  1999 ) but only has 2 galaxies with m@xmath6 10@xmath4 m_@xmath5  ( converting to h@xmath7 = 75 kms@xmath8mpc@xmath8 , which is used throughout this paper ) .",
    "although the debate about the number of low hi mass sources persists , these galaxies certainly do exist .",
    "we detect 7 sources with hi masses @xmath3 10@xmath4 m_@xmath5 , almost as many as all of the previous  blind \" hi surveys combined .",
    "the adbs is one of the largest and most sensitive surveys to date . using the arecibo telescope we were able to achieve an rms of 3 - 4 mjy at a resolution of 32 kms@xmath8  in only 7 seconds and covered @xmath0430 deg@xmath1 .",
    "the adbs covers substantially more volume than the deeper spitzak & schneider ( 1998 ) and the zwaan _ etal . _",
    "( 1997 ) surveys , and is much more sensitive than the larger parkes hipass survey ( kilborn _ etal . _  1999 ) .",
    "hipass will cover the entire southern sky when it is completed , but it has a sensitivity of only 13 mjy at a resolution of 13.2 kms@xmath8  and has trouble with the confusion of multiple hi sources within its 14@xmath9  beam . with the low sensitivity ,",
    "the parkes survey is only able to detect low mass sources at very low redshifts where distances are difficult to determine .    in this paper",
    "we will discuss the hi data and our efforts to quantify the completeness and reliability of this sample .",
    "this is the first survey to use synthetic sources to derive an empirical relation between the flux , line width , and completeness of the survey .",
    "this will allow us to determine an hi mass function even if we do not understand all of the circumstances under which sources are not detected .",
    "the hi mass function will be discussed in rosenberg & schneider ( in preparation ; hereafter paper ii ) .",
    "we also present the optical identifications of the adbs sources from the digitized sky survey ( dss ) images .",
    "we identify 81 hi - rich galaxies that are not in optical catalogs . out of these 81 sources ,",
    "11 are not identified because they are heavily obscured by the galactic plane .",
    "an additional 11 sources are at high galactic latitude where there is no clear optical identification . in most of these cases ,",
    "there is a hint of nebulosity that might be associated , a possible background source , or a bright star , but no convincing association .",
    "even if these optical counterparts are associated , they are extremely faint relative to the mass of hi present . these 11 sources represent the most extreme cases in the survey , but we detect many more sources that were previously uncataloged because they are very faint .",
    "we describe the survey in  2 and the vla and arecibo follow - up in  3 .",
    "the data and data tables are in  4 followed by a discussion of the completeness in  5 and the properties of the sample in  6 .",
    "the results of the survey are summarized in  7 .",
    "the goals of our survey are ( 1 ) to determine whether there are classes of galaxies that have been overlooked previously and ( 2 ) to help tie down the hi mass function with the larger number of sources in this sample . to achieve these goals a ",
    "blind \" hi survey needs to detect galaxies down to the lowest possible hi fluxes .",
    "at least equally important is a detailed understanding of the survey limitations .",
    "the statistics of previous surveys have been insufficient to definitively establish the shape of the hi mass function at both the high and the low mass ends . to improve the statistics one needs to cover a large volume of space . for a fixed total observing time more angular coverage",
    "means less sensitivity but greater volume coverage for a given hi mass since area @xmath10 t@xmath8 but depth @xmath10 t@xmath11 where t is the integration time per point .",
    "therefore the effective volume covered in a fixed observing time @xmath10 t@xmath12 .",
    "this might suggest that integration times should be made as short as possible , except that as sensitivity drops , low mass sources are detectable at smaller redshifts where the distance uncertainty becomes more significant and confusion with galactic hi becomes a problem .    in trying to detect sources",
    "there is also a trade off between completeness and reliability . as digging deeper into the noise",
    "improves completeness , but causes the selection of more and more false sources .",
    "likewise , eliminating narrow features that appear to be interference will eliminate some narrow linewidth sources .",
    "a balance must be achieved between the number of sources that can be verified and going deep enough to detect some of the fainter sources . in the end ,",
    "the importance is in quantifying these selection effects .",
    "we discuss our completeness and reliability in  5 .",
    "there are many factors that go into determining which telescope is most suitable for a given project including collecting area , beam size , and system temperature .",
    "the sensitivity is proportional to the collecting area and inversely proportional to the system temperature .",
    "the collecting area is also inversely proportional to the beam size , so the decrease in beam size for a large telescope increases the time required to cover a given area of the sky .",
    "if the system temperatures are the same , telescopes of different sizes can cover the same area with the same sensitivity in equal times , however if the beam size if too large then source confusion becomes a problem .",
    "confusion may be resolved later , but then it may be difficult to determine whether the galaxies would have been detected independently .",
    "fortunately , at the typical distance of sources detected in only 7 seconds of integration , arecibo s 3.3@xmath9  beamsize is usually able to distinguish neighboring galaxies .    during these observations ,",
    "arecibo was being upgraded and had limited mobility .",
    "this was an advantage for this project because it made large amounts of telescope time available for driftscan searches .",
    "observing in driftscan mode is an efficient method when the goal is to cover a large area on the sky and arecibo is sufficiently sensitive that useful depths can be reached in the time a source takes to drift through the telescope beam .",
    "the lack of tracking also meant that two feeds could be used simultaneously .",
    "we used the 21 cm and 22 cm circular polarization feeds , which have now been replaced by the gregorian reflector .",
    "these were located on opposite corners of the carriage house and pointed 1.6^@xmath13  apart on the sky .",
    "our ability to use two feeds doubled the area surveyed , although it did require coarsening the velocity resolution to twice that in the slice survey ( spitzak & schneider 1998 ) .",
    "one of the major challenges of any single - dish hi survey is to distinguish between real sources and radio interference .",
    "we used three tactics to address this problem while also increasing the volume coverage and improving the signal - to - noise : ( 1 ) comparing data from the 21 and 22 cm feeds taken simultaneously ",
    "the interference usually enters through far sidelobes and appears in both feeds while real sources appear in only one .",
    "( 2 ) comparing left and right circular polarizations in each feed  the average of the two polarizations provides improved signal - to - noise while the difference is an additional check for interference since it is often highly polarized .",
    "( 3 ) observing each declination strip twice , on separate days , providing confirmation of the source detections .",
    "while the driftscan technique allowed us to cover a large volume of space rapidly , it also gave us uncertainties of up to @xmath07@xmath14 in the declination position because the sources could be in the main beam or first sidelobe ( or rarely farther out if the source was very bright at 21 cm ) .",
    "the lack of declination information meant that the sources needed to be reobserved to determine their positions and fluxes .",
    "we subsequently followed - up the identifications at the very large array ( vla ) and at arecibo (  3 ) .",
    "the arecibo 305 m telescope was dedicated to the adbs for approximately 500 hours between december 1993 and february 1994 .",
    "these data consist of @xmath0300,000 spectra taken every 7 seconds and cover nearly 24 hours of time in each of 30 declination strips .",
    "the total sky coverage , shown in figure 1 , is approximately 430 deg@xmath1 in the 3.3@xmath9  main beam . in this figure",
    "each strip is surrounded by two thin lines showing the positions of the sidelobes .",
    "the thick lines denote the regions covered twice while the thin lines denote the regions of single coverage .",
    "the actual sky coverage is the convolution of the sky coverage in figure 1 with the beam shape .",
    "figure 2 shows this convolution for the beginning of a driftscan .",
    "the contours indicate the total integrated detection sensitivity at each position , normalized to unity along the beam s center - line .",
    "the velocity coverage for the survey was 654 to 7977 kms@xmath8 .",
    "this coverage was achieved over 512 channels in each of two polarizations for each of two feeds , totalling 2048 channels .",
    "the channel spacing was 16.9 kms@xmath8  and the resolution was 33.8 kms@xmath8  after hanning smoothing .",
    "the data reduction for adbs spectra was a several step process which was run as an external fortran module to analyz , arecibo observatory s data reduction package .",
    "the data are driftscans and the adjacent spectra behave as off scans for each spectrum .",
    "the resulting noise , after the data have been reduced , is 3 - 4 mjy .",
    "we review the basic steps taken in the data reduction here :    \\(1 ) the total power in the spectra was adjusted according to the recorded power counters .",
    "\\(2 ) an average  off - source \" spectrum was created from all of the spectra in a scan ( usually 300 ) after eliminating any outliers  either due to interference signals in individual channels or continuum flux across all channels .",
    "\\(3 ) each spectrum had the  off \" subtracted and then was normalized by it : @xmath15 .",
    "\\(4 ) synthetic sources were added so that they would go through the flattening procedure .",
    "the synthetic sources are discussed further in  5 .",
    "\\(5 ) the continuum emission was estimated from the total power counters for each spectrum and then subtracted using the bandpass shape of each feed .",
    "the bandpass is assumed to be gaussian centered at 1408.5 and 1398.5 mhz respectively , with a half - power width of 52 mhz for both feeds .",
    "these values were tested and adjusted until subtraction gave a flat response .",
    "\\(6 ) after excluding channels with strong signals compared to surrounding channels , a linear fit was made to each spectrum and subtracted .",
    "\\(7 ) two  off \" scans were created from data on either side of each spectrum . these  offs \" consisted of 19 spectra separated from the  on \" spectrum by 6 spectra . if either of the  offs \" produced an improvement they were used .",
    "the idea was to remove some of the longer time - scale problems ( standing waves and interference ) , that are matched in nearby spectra without removing the source .",
    "\\(8 ) the spectra were hanning smoothed .",
    "\\(9 ) at this point the baseline looked very flat in most cases but there were a few exceptions where there was still low level waviness to the baselines .",
    "a final polynomial fit was designed to eliminate these underlying variations while ignoring any regions where there were rapid variations .",
    "a fifth - order polynomial was fit to each spectrum excluding any regions where there was a change of 7 mjy ( @xmath16 ) or greater over a range of @xmath032kms@xmath8 .",
    "tests showed that this yielded a highly constrained fit that ignored weak , narrow signals , although it could reduce the apparent flux from wide , weak signals , especially when they were near a bandpass edge .",
    "\\(10 ) images were hanning smoothed in right ascension .",
    "the adbs survey was analyzed both by - eye and using the sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) computer algorithm .",
    "in order to facilitate both of these analyses , groups of 300 spectra were turned into two - dimensional grayscale fits images .",
    "figure 3 is an example of one of these images .",
    "the images are 601 rows high with 300 spectra from the 21 cm feed in the top half of the image and 300 22 cm feed spectra , taken at the same time as the first 300 , in the bottom half .",
    "the topmost row of the image ( row 601 ) gives the center velocity of each column or correlator segment .",
    "the columns are broken into two sections ; the first 512 columns represent the 512 correlator channels averaged over the 2 polarizations , the last 512 columns contain the absolute value of the difference between the polarizations used as an interference check .",
    "there are some extra columns between the sum and difference of the polarizations which contain information about the baseline fits for each spectrum , the strength of the continuum , and the spectrum coordinates so that the information is easily available while searching for galaxies .",
    "there are a few features to note in figure 3 .",
    "the first is that the prominent black and white  candy cane \" near the left edge of the image is the milky way .",
    "the milky way emission does not subtract completely from the difference between the two polarizations ( located just to the right of the image center ) probably because the response to such strong emission is not always linear .",
    "the vertical stripes through the averaged polarizations , which stand out better in the polarization difference , are due to continuous interference which is variable in strength .",
    "the leftmost interference stripe shows up in the polarization difference , but not in the averaged polarizations because it is weak and fairly constant in strength .",
    "momentary interference appears as two blips , one in the 21 cm feed and the other in the 22 cm feed .",
    "these blips are also apparent in the polarization difference image .",
    "other images occasionally show a wavy background due to standing wave patterns set up in the telescope . in these regions ,",
    "galaxy detection is difficult but the measured rms noise is also correspondingly bigger . on rare occasions , there is such strong interference that galaxy detection is impossible .",
    "we have identified two galaxies in this image which are marked with arrows in figure 3 .",
    "these detections are average in brightness .      the two dimensional images ( figure 3 ) proved to be a good , albeit time consuming , way to look at these 300,000 spectra . the images allowed us to easily identify strong interference which showed up in both feeds and often persisted for several spectra or would appear at the same wavelength a little later . without this larger scale view it also would have been easy to misidentify peaks in the standing wave patterns as sources .",
    "each image was looked at in tandem with its pair from a different day . with two images , two feeds , and two polarizations at hand ,",
    "the reliability of the galaxy identification was @xmath058% even for sources at a signal - to - noise of less than 7 ( see  5 for full discussion of reliability ) . from the original adbs data we selected 407 sources , 265 of which",
    "were later confirmed .",
    "the identification of sources is a delicate balance between the need for clear - cut selection criteria and the desire for both completeness and reliability of the sources .",
    "examining the data by - eye proved to be very effective in finding sources , but it can be difficult to quantify in terms of the selection criteria .",
    "we also used the sextractor neural network detection algorithm ( bertin & arnouts , 1996 ) to automate the detection process and make it easier to quantify .",
    "these results are discussed in  4 .",
    "the first tests quickly proved that the automated procedure was not very good at providing a reliable data set given only a single image . because of the noise characteristics of the data , the program tended to find either myriad sources or none",
    "the computer algorithm was much more effective when applied to the data for which there were two independent images .",
    "cross - correlation of the detection positions dramatically reduced the number of spurious computer - identified sources . for those images where there was not a second observation , the human eye proved to be much more effective at selecting reliable source candidates .",
    "the first follow - up observations to the adbs were made at 21 cm with the vla in d - array made in january 1998 . with an allotment of 24 hours , it was impossible to follow - up all of the adbs sources so we opted to observe as many of the sources with 2 adbs detections and velocities less than 3000 kms@xmath8  as possible .",
    "we took 10 minute snapshots of 99 of the adbs galaxies .",
    "there were 78 sources observed with velocities of less than 3000 kms@xmath8  in this data set .",
    "of the 99 sources observed , 90 were detected , proving this to be a highly reliable data set as expected for the sources with two adbs detections .",
    "the vla d - array was used for these observations because the sensitivity of this configuration allowed us to detect our sources in a reasonable amount of time and provided good velocity resolution over a large field of view ( 31@xmath9hpbw ) . the synthesized beam - width for",
    "this configuration was 44@xmath17  and we observed at a velocity resolution of 20.5 kms@xmath8 . with 10 minute snapshot integrations we were able to achieve an rms noise of 1.35 mjy / beam at the primary beam center which is below the detection limits of the adbs unless the source was extended over more than about 7 beams .",
    "the vla also provides velocity field information which is unavailable with a single dish observation .",
    "the vla data reduction was performed using standard aips methods .",
    "the images were created and cleaned using imagr with natural weighting .",
    "the final images were then primary beam corrected ( pbcor ) .",
    "the resulting sources were fit using the gaussian fitting routine jmfit which determined the hi centers and sizes .      to refine the positions and fluxes for the remaining adbs sources , they were observed with the newly refurbished arecibo telescope in july 1998 , may 1999 , and august 1999 . to determine the declinations and fluxes of our sources , we chose to track the telescope at the detection right ascension and drive the telescope @xmath187.5@xmath9  from the driftscan declination .",
    "we will refer to this observation method as  decscan \" mode .",
    "the telescope was driven in declination for a total of 3 minutes and spectra were dumped every 10 seconds providing 18 spectra separated by 50 . ",
    "@xmath19  the resulting rms sensitivity is 1.5 mjy .",
    "figure 4a shows an example of the resulting data .",
    "the flux was determined in each of the individual ",
    "decscan \" spectra and a gaussian was fit to the resulting function of total fluxes versus spectrum position as in figure 4b .",
    "the peak of the derived gaussian gives the single - beam flux , and the full width at half - maximum of the fit is a measurement of the galaxy size .",
    "the fit center gives the improved declination position .",
    "the velocity width of the source was determined from a composite spectrum made up of the sum of the spectra in which the source was detectable .    for 10 of the survey sources ( 020045 + 2809 , 024328 + 2035 , 071028 + 2307 , 084411 + 2208 , + 084504 + 0932 , 113845 + 2008 , 171634 + 2135 , 180506 + 2308 , 183229 + 2308 , 231941 + 1011 ) the follow - up arecibo",
    " decscans \" confirmed the detections , but the association with an optical counterpart in the dss images was in question .",
    "for these sources , an  rascan \" was performed , that was identical to the  decscans \" except that the telescope was fixed at the  decscan \" declination and was driven @xmath187.5@xmath9  in right ascension to improve the source coordinates . in most cases the tentative optical counterpart appeared to be confirmed",
    "the source coordinates in table 2 reflect the improved  rascan \" position .",
    "a total of 378 sources were re - observed at arecibo . out of these 215 were detected , 31 had been previously detected at the vla , and 14 sources were observed during two of the arecibo observing runs .",
    "multiple observations of the same sources were used to check the internal consistency of the data set (  6 ) .",
    "table 1 contains a list of the detection statistics for the arecibo dual - beam survey .",
    "we identified 407 possible sources .",
    "the reliability of these sources was 78% when they were covered twice and 42% when there was only a single coverage .",
    "of the 265 sources , 184 have previous optical identifications .",
    "table 2 contains all 265 of the sources that were re - detected on follow - up .",
    "the table contains the rms of the detection scan or scans which is typically 3 - 4 mjy .",
    "the rest of the data in the table are the fluxes , line widths , and velocities from the arecibo and vla follow - up observations .",
    "table 3 is a summary of the adbs catalog identifications and the optical data for these sources .",
    "this optical information is derived using sextractor ( bertin & arnouts , 1996 ) on the dss images .",
    "the red plates of the poss ii ( second palomar optical sky survey ) images were used when they were available , but for 48 sources the red poss i ( first palomar optical sky survey ) plates were used as noted in the table .",
    "sextractor is a routine that first identifies sources in the image , extracts them , and determines their physical parameters .",
    "the routine determines the positions of the major and minor axes , and the total number of pixels exceeding 1@xmath20 .",
    "the dimensions , a and b , that sextractor reports are the rms of the intensity along each axis .",
    "we determined the  size \" of the the galaxy from the number of pixels within the 1-@xmath20 level ellipse : pixels = @xmath21ab@xmath22x@xmath1 where x is the factor to scale from rms to the major or minor axis size . in most cases x was about 2.5 .",
    "this sigma level seemed to best correlate with the visible extent of the galaxies , particularly the ones with extended low surface brightness regions .",
    "figure 5 shows a comparison between sextractor sizes and ugc sizes .",
    "overall , the sextractor measurements agree fairly well with the ugc values .",
    "we suspect that most of the scatter is due to inconsistencies in the depth of the ugc measurement since they were done by - eye on the poss i , where the resolution is lower and where the larger spacing between plates allowed for more variability due to vignetting . in a few of the most extreme cases , the claimed ugc dimensions appear to extend well beyond any visible emission from the galaxy .",
    "table 3 lists only those sources with optical identifications in the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "note that 9 of the identified sources come from low surface brightness or dwarf galaxy surveys like the lsbc ( schombert _ etal .",
    "_  1992 ) , esdo ( eder _ etal . _  1989 ) , kk98 ( karachentseva & karachentseva 1998 ) , kdg ( karachentseva _ etal .",
    "_  1996 ) .",
    "there are also many larger low surface brightness sources in our lists that were identified in the ugc catalog ( nilson , 1973 ) , but missed by more traditional magnitude - limited optical surveys .",
    "in addition , there are galaxies at low galactic latitude and therefore hidden behind our galaxy s gas and dust that can not be detected optically .",
    "30 of the 39 galaxies with visual extinctions @xmath23 1.0 are not in any of the optical catalogs .",
    "completeness is the percentage of galaxies detected in a given volume down to a defined sensitivity limit .",
    "it is important to understand the completeness of the survey as a function of its detection parameters because this relates the number of sources found to the number of sources actually present .",
    "reliability is the percentage of sources initially selected that are subsequently confirmed .",
    "there is a balance between completeness and reliability .",
    "the more sources selected from the original data and the further into the noise one  digs , \" the better the completeness . however , a larger fraction of the selected sources will be unreliable . because of the telescope time required for confirmation , these two must be carefully balanced .    for the adbs data we determine the reliability for both the by - eye and automated detection methods .",
    "the by - eye method proved to be much more reliable .",
    "overall we confirm 78% of the possible signals with two original detections and 42% for those with only a single detection .",
    "the reliability is @xmath2370% for both single and double detections when the signal - to - noise is above 7 but it falls to 57% for double detections and 37% for single detections below this limit .",
    "while the reliability does decrease at lower signal - to - noise values , especially for sources with only a single detection , the statistics are still much better than with sextractor .",
    "with sextractor the reliability was only 12% for double detection sources and uncovered no genuine sources not already found by - eye .    in general , it is not possible to determine the completeness of a survey based on the detections .",
    "it if often assumed that the sensitivity of a survey is determined by the sources with the lowest signal - to - noise .",
    "( 1998 ) showed that @xmath24 tests indicate that this sort of simple sensitivity cutoff does not adequately describe survey completeness . to quantify the completeness of the adbs we added synthetic sources spanning the full range of galaxy linewidths and with fluxes varying from undetectable to that of bright galaxies that we expected to detect easily .",
    "these sources were given realistic line profile shapes and were all added to the data prior to the reduction procedure .",
    "we use the synthetic sources to determine completeness as a function of signal - to - noise and to compare the results of our by - eye and automated detection methods .",
    "figure 6 shows the percentage completeness as a function of signal - to - noise for automated detection ( solid line ) and by - eye detection ( dotted line ) .",
    "the figure demonstrates the similarity in detection ability of the two methods , but there is a small improvement using automated detection .",
    "we use visual inspection in making our source lists because , though it slightly decreases the completeness , it greatly improves the reliability .",
    "we note that all of the by - eye detections that were confirmed were also detected by the automated algorithm .",
    "we also ran a test in which we reobserved 25 randomly - selected sextractor detections . out of these",
    ", 3 were also detected by - eye and were confirmed whereas none of additional 22 possible signals were confirmed in follow - up .",
    "two effects on completeness are apparent in these simulations .",
    "first , we confirm that wide - line sources are not detected at @xmath25 levels quite as low as narrow - line sources when the noise is assumed to increase as @xmath26 . by assuming the effective noise grows like @xmath27 , which schneider _ etal . _  ( 1998 ) adopted based on the @xmath24 test , a consistent shape for the completeness curve is found independent of profile width .",
    "second , with the statistics of several hundred synthetic sources , it is possible to characterize the behavior of the roll - off in completeness .",
    "it is apparent that occasionally even high @xmath25 sources are missed and some @xmath28 sources are detected .",
    "these results are consistent for the two detection methods and will be important for the determination of the mass function in paper ii .",
    "figure 7 is another way of examining the completeness of the sample .",
    "the first panel shows the synthetic sources .",
    "the detected sources are shown as filled gray dots while those we did not detect are shown as open circles . the completeness line with a slope of 0.75 and a  s / n \" of 5 ( using the formalism of schneider _ etal .",
    "_  1998 ) is shown .",
    "the line represents a good fit to the lower limit of the detected points , but it * does not * represent a 100% completeness limit .",
    "the apparent difference in the completeness for narrower and wider sources is not a real one .",
    "in fact , the completeness above the  s / n \" = 5 line is 78% for all sources and 80% for sources with widths",
    "@xmath3 300 kms@xmath8 .",
    "the second panel in figure 7 shows fluxes and line widths of confirmed real sources in the adbs ( gray dots ) .",
    "the data represented here are the confirmed values for the widths and fluxes adjusted for frequency response and the offset of the source from beam center .",
    "we use these confirmed sources since they are of higher signal - to - noise and therefore give a better indication of the true flux .",
    "we have eliminated all sources with offsets greater than 2@xmath14  from this plot because of the uncertainties in the measured flux when sources are beyond the half - power beamwidth .",
    "these uncertainties arise from the effect of small errors in the pointing and a lack of complete information about the hi extent .",
    "figure 8 shows the percentage completeness for the synthetic sources as a function of velocity .",
    "notice the spikes in incompleteness near either end and in the center of the velocity range .",
    "these correspond to the ends of the bandpass segments .",
    "the baseline fitting at the ends of the segments is particularly prone to problems with source subtraction because there is not baseline on either side of the feature to distinguish a source from a baseline  wiggle .",
    "\" there is the additional problem for real sources in these regions that the sensitivity is falling off rapidly at the bandpass edges .",
    "if we eliminate sources with velocities @xmath3 300 kms@xmath8  ( to deal with confusion with the milky way too ) and between 3100 and 3600 kms@xmath8  the data are 82% complete above our  5@xmath20 completeness \" limit .    the ideal check of completeness is to have a much deeper survey over the same area of sky , with the same instrument , with which to compare your results .",

    "their sample consists of @xmath0 10 hour driftscans at 2 declinations covered repeatedly to achieve about 5 times the sensitivity of our survey ( rms noise = 0.75 mjy in 16 kms@xmath8  channels ) .",
    "one of these strips , at @xmath023^@xmath13 , overlaps one of ours within 20 . ",
    "@xmath19  because their data are much more sensitive , we can test our completeness although small number statistics make it impossible to use these results for a detailed study of sensitivity roll - off .",

    "the shaded histogram is the offset between the vla positions and the optical positions , these offsets have a standard deviation of 31 .  @xmath19  this standard deviation is larger than expected from the measurement uncertainties of the optical and vla positions and may be partially due to asymmetries in the hi distribution with respect to the optical emission .",
    "figure 9b shows the uncertainty in the original declination positions also using either the vla or optical counterpart positions .",
    "the open histogram is the offset between the detection declinations and either the vla or the optical positions .",
    "the standard deviation in this distribution is 2.1@xmath9  which is about two - thirds of the width of the main beam , but there are several sources that are detected in the sidelobes up to 7 @xmath9  from the vla or optical centers .",

    "our initial adbs positions are up to 7@xmath14  from the galaxy center .",

    "we found a few candidate signals in this velocity range , but none were confirmed .",
    "figure 12 shows that the distribution of galaxies in velocity space is fairly flat ; this is probably due to surveying many different environments over a large area on the sky which tends to smear the signatures of large scale structure .",
    "the redshift - position distributions of the galaxies are shown in figures 13 a and b. we have broken the sample into a low declination region and a high declination region and plot the redshift versus ra .",
    "the stars in the plot represent adbs sources that are overlayed on gray dots representing the rc3 ( de vaucouleurs _ etal . _  1991 ) sources .",

    "some sources , like those with just a bit of wispy nebulosity and low galactic latitude objects , were not measurable optically so they are not included . while the mean size is @xmath0100@xmath17 , the majority of the sources are smaller than 70@xmath29     table 4 lists all of the sources for which no optical counterpart was firmly identified .",
