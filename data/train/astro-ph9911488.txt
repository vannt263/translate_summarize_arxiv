    "knowledge of the distribution and kinematics of the circumnuclear molecular gas in seyfert galaxies is essential for understanding the fueling of the central region and the role of gas and dust in obscuring the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "recent improvements in millimeter interferometry now allow us to observe molecular lines with sub - arcsecond resolution , high spectral resolution , and high sensitivity . in nearby seyfert galaxies , with the best resolution currently available ,",
    "we can now search for molecular gas down to radii of a few tens of parsecs .",
    "models of the motions of this molecular gas can then help us to understand the mechanism that transports gas into the center .",
    "an overview of the modeling results so far is given in schinnerer , eckart & tacconi ( 1999a ; hereafter set99a ) , and a detailed model of the nuclear molecular gas in the seyfert  1 galaxy ngc  3227 is given by schinnerer , eckart & tacconi ( 1999b ; hereafter set99b ) . in the inner 80  pc of ngc  3227 , for example , the kinematics of the molecular gas are better explained by a warping of the thin gas disk than by motion in the potential of a nuclear stellar bar . in that galaxy ,",
    "molecular gas is detected down to a radius of @xmath4 10pc .    in this paper , we model the complex kinematics of the central few hundred parsecs of the seyfert  2 galaxy ngc  1068 .",
    "this galaxy is at a distance of 14.4mpc ( @xmath11 = 75 ; see bland - hawthorn et al .",
    "1997 ) , giving a scale of 72pc arcsec@xmath12 ( * table [ vv40 ] * ) , which is very favorable for detailed studies of the circumnuclear gas .",
    "ngc  1068 was originally classed as a seyfert  2 galaxy based on its direct - path , i.e. unpolarized emission lines , which have narrow widths ( khachikian & weedman 1974 ) .",
    "this narrow - line region ( nlr ) is extended to the northeast of the nucleus and coincides with the radio jet .",
    "antonucci & miller ( 1985 ) later showed that the scattered - path , polarized emission lines have widths typical of broad - line regions ( blr ) , indicating that ngc  1068 has a hidden seyfert  1 nucleus . around this nucleus , there is a central nuclear star cluster with a fwhm diameter of @xmath13 ( 43pc ) that was mapped by thatte et al .",

    ", there is a stellar bar 2.3kpc long , detected in the nir ( scoville et al .",

    "this bar is in turn surrounded by a circumnuclear starburst ring that , along with other star forming regions , contributes half the bolometric luminosity of the galaxy ( telesco et al .",
    "1984 ; davies et al . 1998 ) .",
    "this starburst ring is also detected in lines of molecular gas ( planesas et al . 1991 ; jackson et al . 1993 ; tacconi et al .",

    "the plan of this paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the observations and data reduction .",
    "section 3 covers the distribution and kinematics of the co emission , the millimeter continuum , and the location of the nucleus . in section 4",
    "we derive the rotation curve of the molecular gas and discuss its relation to the stellar bar and the location of dynamical resonances .",
    "we then derive the molecular gas mass and the total dynamical mass ( section 5 ) and derive the thickness of the molecular gas disk from the velocity dispersion ( section 6 ) . in section 7 , we fit the kinematic data with bar and warp models . and discuss the model results in section 8 .",
    "section 9 summarizes our conclusions .",
    "the @xmath0co lines were observed in february / march 1997 with the iram interferometer on plateau de bure , france , with 5 antennas in the long - baseline a , b1 , and b2 configurations and in november 1995 to march 1996 with 4 antennas in the shorter - baseline c1 , c2 , and d1 configurations . the @xmath0co ( 10 )",
    "observations had baselines from 24 to 408 m that gave a beam of @xmath14 at p.a .",
    "26@xmath15 after uniform weighting .",
    "the @xmath0co ( 21 ) observations had only the a , b1 , and b2 baselines , ranging from 40 to 408 m , that gave a beam of @xmath16 ( p.a .",
    "26@xmath15 ) after uniform weighting .",
    "the bandpass was calibrated on 3c454.3 and 3c345 .",
    "the source 0235 + 164 was observed every 10min for phase and amplitude calibration .",
    "the data were cleaned with 700 iterations and convolved to beams of @xmath17 at @xmath0co ( 10 ) and @xmath18 at @xmath0co ( 21 ) , with velocity channels of 10  for both lines .",
    "we also made a 115ghz continuum map from the line - free channels from @xmath19310 to @xmath19190  and + 200 to + 320 . to estimate the line flux , we subtracted the mean continuum from the channels with ( line+continuum ) .",
    "our @xmath0co ( 10 ) map agrees well with co maps made with other interferometers , and our integrated @xmath0co ( 10 ) flux agrees with that in the interferometer spectrum of helfer & blitz ( 1995 ) to within 15% .",
    "helfer & blitz ( 1995 ) also combined their bima array and nrao single dish data .",
    "their bima / nrao map has 25 to 30% more flux than their bima map alone , so some of the large - scale flux may be resolved out by the bima and iram arrays . to check our calibration of the @xmath0co ( 21 ) line emission",

    "the @xmath21 ratio for the nuclear ring is 1.0 ( @xmath22% ) , in agreement with the ratio of 1.1 found in this region with the iram 30 m telescope ( braine & combes 1992 ) .",
    "our new observations allow us to study the millimeter molecular line and continuum emission at an unprecedented angular resolution .",
    "the @xmath0co ( 21 ) data , in particular , give very detailed maps of the molecular gas in the inner 200  pc of ngc  1068 . at 100  pc from the center , the @xmath0co ( 21 )",
    "emission is in a ring ( hereafter the _ nuclear ring _ ; * fig .",
    "[ vv1 ] * ) . in this nuclear ring",
    ", there are two emission knots , one at @xmath23 east of the nucleus and another one @xmath24 west and @xmath23 south of the center . at @xmath25 north and south of the center , there are emission ridges connecting the two knots at 25% of the peak line intensity .",
    "this same overall nuclear structure also exists in the cs(21 ) line ( tacconi et al .",
    "1997 ) and the hcn(10 ) line ( tacconi et al . 1994 ) .",
    "the @xmath26 ratio is between 0.8 and 1.0 over the entire nuclear ring , except for a part of the western emission knot , which has a ratio of 2.0 .",
    "this is also evident in the nuclear spectra . the @xmath0co ( 21 )",
    "profile has three peaks while the @xmath0co ( 10 ) profile has only two .",
    "the missing peak in the @xmath0co ( 10 ) line is offset by + 75  relative to the systemic velocity and is associated with the western knot .",
    "this suggests the co lines are optically thin in parts of the western knot .",
    "as shown in earlier maps , most of the @xmath0co ( 10 ) emission is in two spiral arms with a diameter of @xmath27 ( * fig .",
    "[ vv1 ] * ; planesas et al .",

    "east of the center is 1.5 times stronger than the spiral - arm emission . in our map ,",
    "the northern spiral arm is less luminous than the southern one , in contrast to the earlier measurements of helfer & blitz ( 1995 ; see below ) .",
    "co emission is also observed along the nir stellar bar found by scoville et al .",
    "( 1988 ) at about half of the nuclear peak intensity . with our @xmath20 beam",
    ", we mainly find emission in the northern half of the bar . in the lower resolution ( @xmath28 )",
    "@xmath0co ( 10 ) data ( tacconi et al . 1997 ) emission is seen on both sides of the bar , but stronger north of the nucleus .",
    "both sides of the bar were also detected in lower resolution @xmath0co ( 10 ) maps by helfer & blitz ( 1995 ) and in the @xmath29co(10 ) map by tacconi et al .",
    "the tips of the nir stellar bar almost touch the spiral arms .",
    "the spiral arms are not detected in the @xmath0co ( 21 ) map , because their diameter is larger than the @xmath30 primary beam of the iram antennas , and a mosaic map would be needed to recover the spiral arms in @xmath0co ( 21 ) .",
    "furthermore , the spiral arms are weaker than the nucleus and they may be partly resolved since we only used long baseline configurations for the @xmath0co ( 21 ) mapping .",
    "our @xmath0co ( 10 ) intensity map agrees well with the ovro map ( baker & scoville 1998 ; private communication ) .",
    "differences with the earlier data of helfer & blitz ( 1995 ) may be due to uncertainties in the calibration and deconvolution of the bima / nrao data and the possibility that 30% of the extended line flux is resolved out in our interferometer map .",
    "our 115ghz continuum map shows two emission knots , one coinciding with the nucleus , and the other @xmath31 east and @xmath32 north of the nucleus ( * fig .",
    "[ vv2 ] * ) .",
    "the nuclear knot is slightly resolved by our @xmath20 beam .",
    "a gaussian fit gives @xmath33 at p.a .",
    "at 115ghz , the nuclear knot has a flux density of ( 36@xmath345)mjy , while the northern knot has ( 15@xmath345)mjy .",
    "the northern knot coincides with the peak of the 5ghz radio jet mapped by wilson & ulvestad ( 1983 ) , as noted previously by helfer & blitz ( 1995 ) , who observed the same two continuum knots in their bima map at 85ghz .",
    "this structure at 85ghz is also observed with the iram array ( tacconi 1999 ; private communication ) . at 85ghz ,",
    "both knots have the same flux density , 40mjy . at 230  ghz ,",
    "no continuum emission was detected , to a limit of 6mjy at each knot .",
    "in this section , we describe the velocity field of the molecular gas , estimate the enclosed nuclear mass , and derive a rotation curve .",
    "we then combine this rotation curve with optical and ir evidence for bars in ngc  1068 to deduce the locations of dynamical resonances .      a striking feature of the @xmath0co ( 10 ) velocity field is the change of position angle of the kinematic major axis within the spiral arms ( * fig.[vv3 ] a and c * ) . at radii",

    "1997 ) . at @xmath38 ,",
    "the kinematic major axis changes its position angle from 278@xmath15 to 305@xmath15 .",
    "the change in position angle at @xmath39 also occurs in the velocity fields of the h@xmath40 ( dehnen et al .",
    "1997 ) and the stars ( garcia - lorenzo et al .",
    "this effect also appears in the hcn(10 ) line ( jackson et al .",
    "1993 ; tacconi et al . 1994 ) and was analyzed by helfer & blitz ( 1995 ) in @xmath0co ( 10 ) .      in the inner 500pc , the @xmath0co ( 21 ) velocity field",
    "is perturbed by the two bright knots @xmath10 east and west of the nucleus that do not follow the overall circular rotation . to more easily separate symmetric and asymmetric components and see which bits of the molecular gas have ordered motions , we used position - velocity diagrams ( @xmath41 diagrams ) along different angles .",
    "we made @xmath41 diagrams every 20@xmath15 starting at 10@xmath15 ( * fig .",
    "[ vv4 ] * ) .",
    "the diagram along p.a .",
    "110@xmath15 is remarkably symmetric and has most of the flux , because it crosses both emission knots .",
    "all diagrams close to the kinematic _ minor _ axis are compact , because there is only weak emission north and south of the center .    in @xmath0co ( 21 ) , the western knot ( knot w )",
    "is slightly farther from the nucleus ( @xmath42 ) than the eastern knot .",
    "knot w appears in @xmath41 diagrams at p.a .",
    "50@xmath15 and 70@xmath15 , with a velocity dispersion of 60 .",
    "knot e , with a velocity dispersion of 70 , appears in @xmath41 diagrams at p.a .",
    "150@xmath15 , 170@xmath15 , 0@xmath15 , and 10@xmath15 as a distinct component from @xmath19230 to @xmath1930  at @xmath42 southeast of the center . to estimate these components flux , we calculated the moments only for velocities @xmath19230 to @xmath1930 .",
    "the apparent dispersion of knot w is a mixture of the 40  velocity spread of the nuclear disk with the 30  spread of the knot itself .",
    "for the eastern knot , it is hard to see the knot component , since it is blended with the larger - scale rotating disk .",
    "these two knots ( * table [ vv42 ] * ) contain a few 10@xmath43m@xmath6  of molecular gas , which suggests they are giant molecular cloud complexes .",
    "there is a similar mixture in the circumnuclear molecular gas in ngc  3227 , where we also found several components deviating from the overall circular rotation ( set99b ) .",
    "all position - velocity diagrams show significant high velocity emission at @xmath44 , similar to that in the nucleus of ngc  3227 ( set99b ) . if the high velocities trace rotation in the immediate vicinity of the nucleus , we can estimate the enclosed nuclear mass .",
    "the minimum radius at which we detect an emission peak of high - velocity nuclear molecular gas is 13.5pc , and its mean velocity relative to systemic is @xmath45 , uncorrected for inclination . if this is rotation , it implies a mass @xmath46m@xmath6  within the inner 27pc diameter , comparable with the mass of @xmath47m@xmath6within the inner 70pc of our galaxy ( genzel et al . 1994 ) .",
    "this is ten times the black hole mass of @xmath48m@xmath6  estimated from h@xmath8o masers in the inner 2pc of ngc  1068 ( greenhill & gwinn 1997 ) . the mass in the inner 27pc is thus mostly due to a central , compact part of the @xmath13 ( 43pc ) stellar cluster as mapped by thatte et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "the molecular gas velocity field inside the spiral arms is complex , making it hard to derive the rotation curve from @xmath0co alone .",
    "we now discuss our best estimate of the co rotation curve and compare our results with the stellar motions .",
    "we show that the velocity fields of gas and stars are similar , reflecting the influence of the bar on the motions at @xmath49 .",
    "we think the difference in the rotation curves of the gas and stars could be due to the complex dynamics induced by the stellar bulge .",
    "the @xmath0co velocity field in the center of ngc  1068 deviates strongly from circular rotation at @xmath50 , so a rotation curve derived from a rotating disk model would probably be wrong .",
    "the velocity field and @xmath41 diagrams show however , that most of the @xmath0co emission is indeed from a centro - symmetric structure .",
    "we therefore used the first - moment velocity maps of the @xmath0co ( 10 ) and @xmath0co ( 21 ) emission to determine the velocity extrema in circular annuli around the center .",
    "we chose the @xmath0co ( 21 ) velocity map because the high - velocity - dispersion knots on either side of the nucleus are partly resolved ( * figs.[vv1 ] and [ vv4 ] * ) .",
    "the mean velocities in these maps are lower limits to the true rotation speeds since we did not correct for inclination .",
    "our mean curve , corrected for an inclination @xmath51 , agrees well with published rotation curves within the uncertainties ( * fig.[vv5 ] * ) .",
    "we compared our rotation curve with that derived from h@xmath40 ( dehnen et al .",
    "1997 ; errors 10 to 30  for @xmath52 ) and with the curve derived from the bima @xmath0co ( 10 ) data ( helfer & blitz 1995 ; errors 30 to 70  for @xmath52 and 10 to 20  for @xmath53 ) .    from @xmath54 moving inward , our @xmath0co ( 21 ) rotation curve first increases by 50  and then decreases again at @xmath55 .",
    "this range of radii contains the nuclear ring and the two barely - resolved co knots east and west of the nucleus .",
    "the @xmath41 diagrams along p.a.110@xmath15 are similar in @xmath0co ( 10 ) and @xmath0co ( 21 ) .",
    "we derived the rotation curve at @xmath56 for two cases : ( 1 ) rotation velocities go to 0  at the center , and ( 2 ) keplerian velocities around a point mass interior to @xmath57 ( section [ cc1 ] ) .",
    "garcia - lorenzo et al .",
    "( 1997 ) mapped the stellar velocities in the inner @xmath58 with the optical ca ii triplet at @xmath59 8498 , 8575 , and 8695 .",
    "the velocity field of the stars matches that of the @xmath0co ( 10 ) emission to within 50  and @xmath23 .",
    "this indicates that at @xmath60 ( the resolution of the garcia - lorenzo et al .",
    "data ) , the stars and gas have similar kinematics .",
    "the velocity dispersion observed in the ca  ii lines agrees well with the velocity dispersion derived in the nir ( dressler 1984 ; terlevich et al .",
    "1990 ; oliva et al .",
    "1995 ) , suggesting that the velocity field measured in the ca  ii line is indeed representative of the overall nuclear region ( inner 15  to 20  ) and does not merely trace the surface of an otherwise obscured stellar system .    for both stars and gas , at radii @xmath61 , the isovelocity lines in the north bend to the east , and the isovelocity lines in the south bend to the west .",
    "such a bending is as expected from our model calculations ( section [ ecc6 ] ) for orbits induced by a bar",
    ". it also agrees with the expected behavior of gas and stars in the potential of the nir bar ( e.g. , athanassoula 1992 ; maciejewski & sparke 1999 ) . to confirm this finding observationally ,",
    "more data are needed on the ca  ii velocity field south ( @xmath62 ) of the nucleus , since the bending in the isovelocity lines occurs at a higher velocity relative to systemic than in the north .",
    "higher - sensitivity molecular line data south of the nucleus would also be useful .      in the inner region the kinematics of stars and gas",
    "may be decoupled .",
    "the stellar kinematic data ( garcia - lorenzo et al .",
    "1997 ) indicate that the stellar rotation curve lies well below the rotation curve derived from the @xmath0co data .",
    "this probably reflects the fact that in the inner @xmath63 the velocity dispersion of the stars is higher relative to that of the molecular gas . in this region ,",
    "the gravitational force of the gas is negligible relative to that of the stars , so we estimate the effects of different stellar potentials as follows .",
    "( 1 ) we start with the simplest model , an isotropic , spherical stellar cluster .",
    "( 2 ) we then generalize our model to central oblate stellar systems .",
    "( 3 ) finally , we consider the effect of a stellar bar on stellar orbits in the center of ngc  1068 .",
    "_ isotropic , spherical stellar cluster : _ the mass of an isotropic , spherical , non - rotating stellar cluster can be estimated from the stellar velocity dispersion and the jeans equation , derived from the collisionless boltzmann equation ( see binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "thatte et al .",
    "( 1997 ) assumed a velocity dispersion of 140  ( dressler 1984 ) to estimate a mass of @xmath64m@xmath6  within the inner @xmath65 diameter .",
    "this is nearly twice our value of @xmath66 m@xmath6  for the same region derived from the molecular gas .",
    "the discrepancy could be due to ( 1 ) the stellar flux coming from supergiants with deeper ca ii absorption than in the template giant stars , yielding a lower apparent velocity dispersion , or ( 2 ) the velocity dispersion of the underlying bulge component , which emits up to 45% of the light in the inner @xmath2 ( table 1 of thatte et al .",
    "comparison of @xmath67-band data in the inner @xmath68 , which show constant velocity dispersion ( dressler 1984 ) , with the nuclear @xmath69 and @xmath70 band data indicates that the velocity spread of the nuclear cluster can not exceed that of the outer zone .",
    "all this suggests the mass derived by thatte et al .",
    "( 1997 ) is an upper limit to the enclosed nuclear mass .",
    "_ central oblate system : _ observations and theory suggest bars turn into bulges at small radii ( norman et al .",
    "1996 ; hasan et al . 1993 ; combes et al . 1990 ) .",
    "for these systems the jeans equation separates into two equations giving the vertical and radial form of the gravitational potential ( see review by merritt 1999 ) .",
    "binney & tremaine ( 1987 , their fig .  4 - 5 ) show that if self - similar isodensity ellipsoids of stellar spheroidal systems become more spherical at smaller radii then @xmath71 falls below unity .",
    "this is indeed indicated by @xmath70-band images for @xmath72 ( e.g. , fig .  1 in thatte et al .",
    "hence if the observed stellar velocity dispersion is constant , the circular velocity must decrease at smaller radii .",
    "this is consistent with the observed drop in the stellar rotation curve toward the center of ngc  1068",
    ".    _ influence of a bar potential : _",
    "ngc  1068 has a stellar bar in the inner @xmath73 seen in the nir ( scoville et al .",
    "1988 ; thronson et al .",
    "bars have prolate symmetry and are probably triaxial .",
    "such a system can have an anisotropic velocity dispersion and its ellipsoid need not be coaxial with the bar ( fillmore 1986 ) .",
    "it is thus not easy to predict the velocity dispersion , since in a bar potential , many orbit families are extended in the @xmath74-direction and there can be radial and vertical resonances that support specific orbit families , affecting the stellar velocity dispersion ( e.g. pfenniger 1984 ; combes et al . 1990 ; olle & pfenniger 1998 ) .",
    "unlike the stars in the center of ngc  1068 , the molecular gas has a low velocity dispersion ( section [ ecc2 ] ) , indicating it is decoupled from the stars .",
    "this explains why the gas rotation curve  which we used for our models  lies above the stellar rotation curve by garcia - lorenzo et al .",
    "( 1997 ) at small radii .",
    "hence , for circular orbits , the molecular gas is a good tracer of the potential and its rotation curve is governed by the enclosed dynamical mass .",
    "the interaction of the molecular gas with the stellar gravitational potential leads to resonances that in turn determine the distribution and kinematics of the gas .",
    "we now discuss the evidence for bars and the locations of dynamical resonances in ngc  1068 .",
    "although ngc  1068 is not normally considered a barred spiral , scoville et al .",

    "the ends of the nir stellar bar join the spiral arms in the molecular gas ( e.g. , tacconi et al .",
    ". in most bar theories , there are no massive pile - ups of gas at the corotation radius near the ends of the bar .",
    "these accumulations are only expected at the inner and outer lindblad resonances .",
    "the fact that the arms are at the bar corotation radius is thus puzzling and could indicate the dynamical effect of a second , larger bar in ngc  1068 .",
    "( here , we assume that the corotation lies about at the end of the bar as found for late type galaxies , see combes 1997 for a review . )",

    ", however , the _ kinematic _ major axis runs almost exactly east - west .",
    "hence the eccentricity of the oval structure on the sky is not due to the galaxy s inclination ; instead , this structure is _ a large - scale bar along the minor axis of ngc  1068_. in the palomar sky survey images of ngc  1068 , the outer , weak emission ( radii @xmath81 ) is extended east - west , and the eccentricity of its lowest contours corresponds to the 40@xmath15 inclination derived from hi velocities ( brinks et al .",
    "deprojection of the optical image then yields a bar length of @xmath82 ( 17.3kpc ) . as shown in section [ ecc20 ] , this bar has its inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) at @xmath83 ( 1.3kpc ) , near the molecular spiral arms . the outer bar - like structure in ngc  1068",
    "could thus be the cause of these spiral arms .",
    "further support for this idea comes from the deprojected shape of the molecular spiral arms , which is an almost perfect ring  as expected for an ilr .",
    "it suggests the nir bar is a second bar inside the ilr , similar to nuclear bars in other galaxies ( e.g. friedli et al .",

    ", light should be polarized parallel to the disk .",
    "the reason is as follows : bands of parallel polarization vectors are often observed in bipolar stellar outflows and can be reproduced by multiple scattering models ( bastien & menard 1988 ; fischer , henning , & yorke 1996 ) .",
    "these bands are often normal to the flow and occur especially in edge - on disks with high densities and particle sizes that are large relative to the wavelength of scattered light ( fischer et al .",
    "besides strong forward and backward scattering , the mie process also yields highly polarized emission , with the @xmath188 vectors and the maximum polarized intensity both perpendicular to the direction of forward scattering .",
    "the light is strongly concentrated in two outflow cones , with the intense , back - scattered light illuminating the disk .",
    "this scattered light is then polarized parallel to the disk , over the total illuminated area ( fischer et al .",
    "1996 ; bastien & menard 1988 ) .",
    "bands with parallel polarization thus occur most clearly in edge - on disks .    from the near- and mid - ir polarization maps of ngc  1068 , young et al .",

    "alternatively , the alignment of the nir polarization vectors could be due to absorption of the central stellar continuum by elongated dust grains aligned in a magnetic field by the davis - greenstein effect ( greenberg 1978 ) .",
    "if so , then the magnetic field lines should lie in the plane of the absorbing gas disk , parallel to the polarization vectors . in this scenario , however , the mid - ir polarization vectors should be orthogonal to the nir vectors , since the scattering efficiency is low at long wavelengths ( unless the grains are very large ) , and the mid - ir flux is dust emission rather than scattered light .",

    "this is consistent with the black hole mass of @xmath7m@xmath6  indicated by the h@xmath8o masers ( greenhill & gwinn 1997 ) , plus a significant contribution from the mass of the nuclear stellar cluster ( thatte et al .",

    "_ cause of the warp. _ the probable cause for warping of the gas disk is the gas pressure in the ionization cone .",
    "this scenario is also proposed for the geometry in m  84 ( quillen & bower 1999 ) .",
    "further possibilities are the influence of the transition between the disk / bar and bulge potential , or dislocated gmcs transiently disturbing the gas disk .",
    "_ small tori are not needed. _ as the results by gallimore et al .",
    "( 1997 ) show it is very likely that ngc  1068 has a @xmath1912  pc molecular torus .",

    "therefore we do speculate that long - postulated ( large - scale ) molecular tori with radii of a few 10 pc to a few 100 pc are not needed in every case .",
    "the more likely explanation of the seyfert 1/seyfert 2 differences is that the molecular gas in the center of the host galaxy contributes significantly to the obscuration of the active nucleus and thereby influences the classification ( malkan et al .",

    "the gas spiral arms are at the ilr of a large - scale outer bar. _ analysis of the structure of ngc  1068 shows that the 3kpc long , nir stellar bar is an inner bar , since the galaxy also has an outer bar - like structure about 17kpc long .",
