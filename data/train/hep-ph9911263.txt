    "several decay modes have been observed for the first time , such as @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "improved new bounds have been put on the branching ratios for various modes , such as @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "a search for cp asymmetries in @xmath22 , @xmath18 , @xmath23 , @xmath21 , and @xmath11 has also been performed .",
    "recently , two works have been done to explain the recent cleo results for @xmath0 decays : one of them is based on the flavor su(3 ) symmetry @xcite , and the other one involves the framework of factorization @xcite . in the latter work , the existence of _ two different _ effective numbers of color , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , is essential , and their favored values are @xmath26 and @xmath27 to explain the experimental data , except for @xmath28 and @xmath29 .    in the light of the recent cleo data , in this work , we will analyze _ both _ @xmath6 and @xmath30 with a _",

    "our main emphasis was to explain the large branching ratio for @xmath38 within factorization . in order to explain the large branching ratio for @xmath38 , different assumptions have been proposed , e.g. , large form factors @xcite , the qcd anomaly effect @xcite , high charm content in @xmath39 @xcite , a new mechanism in the standard model @xcite , or new physics like supersymmetry without r - parity @xcite . in this work",
