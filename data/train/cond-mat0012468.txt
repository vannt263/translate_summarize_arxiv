    "it is known that the stationary distributions ( bound states ) of the magnetic flux @xmath0 in `` long '' ( one - dimensional ) josephson junctions ( jjs ) can be modeled as solutions of the nonlinear boundary value problem ( bvp ) : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the bias current , and @xmath3 is the external ( boundary ) magnetic field .",
    "we note that the kind of boundary conditions , either in presence or in absence of the current @xmath4 in the right - hand side of eqn .",
    "( [ sg ] ) , is determined by the geometry of the junction .",
    "here we consider simple jjs with overlap geometry @xcite , in which the current @xmath4 can be approximately considered as a constant .",
    "the generalization of our results in the case of another geometry , for example in - line geometry , does not require big efforts .",
    "we suppose that the given function @xmath5 describes the variations of the josephson current amplitude , caused by the possible local inhomogeneities of the dielectric layer thickness @xcite .",
    "when @xmath6 the junction is homogeneous ( see the complete analytical results in recent paper @xcite ) .",
    "the single inhomogeneity is characterized by its respective position @xmath7 and width @xmath8 , so the amplitude @xmath9 .",
    "the frequently used expression @xmath10 ( here @xmath11 is dirac s function ) is useful in theoretical examination ( see the basic papers @xcite and @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we use an isosceles trapezium with base @xmath12 ( fig.1 ) as a more suitable physical model of inhomogeneity @xcite .",
    "figure 1    the stability of some concrete solution @xmath0 of the bvp ( [ sg ] ) is determined by the sign of the minimal eigenvalue @xmath13 of the corresponding sturm - liouville problem ( slp ) : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the potential of slp , originated from the mentioned solution @xmath0 .",
    "each of the different eigenvalues @xmath16 conforms to an unique eigenfunction @xmath17 @xmath18 , which satisfies some additional ( norm ) condition , for example : @xmath19    if the minimal eigenvalue @xmath20 , then the respective solution @xmath0 of bvp ( [ sg ] ) is stable with respect to small time - space perturbations . if the minimal eigenvalue @xmath21 , then this solution is unstable .",
    "the value @xmath22 corresponds to a bifurcation point , in which the stable solutions of eqn .",
    "( [ sg ] ) go to unstable ones and vice versa ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "apart from the space coordinate @xmath23 , the virtual solutions of the nonlinear bvp ( [ sg ] ) depend also on the physical parameters @xmath3 , @xmath4 and the `` technological '' ones @xmath12 , @xmath24 ( length of the junction ) , and @xmath7 , i.e. , @xmath25 , where we simply substitute @xmath26 .",
    "the varying of each of those parameters causes a variation of the distribution @xmath27 and , therefore , subsequent variations of the potential @xmath28 , the eigenvalues @xmath29 , and the respective eigenfunctions @xmath30 .",
    "thus , we can conclude that every concrete solution of bvp ( [ sg ] ) has an area , where this solution remains stable with regard to the variations of the parameters @xmath31 . in the parametric space",
    "the equation : @xmath32 determines a hypersurface , whose points appear to be bifurcation points corresponding to the solution under consideration .",
    "the intersections of the bifurcation hypersurface ( [ eq:7 ] ) , when there are chosen pairs of the parameters @xmath31 for fixed values of others , are called bifurcation curves and the respective values of the parameters - bifurcation ( critical ) parameters . from a physical viewpoint most interesting",
    "seem to be the bifurcation curves of the kind `` current - magnetic flux '' @xmath33 , when the geometrical parameters @xmath12 , @xmath34 , and @xmath7 are fixed .",
    "these curves could be obtained experimentally @xcite .",
    "figure 2    from a technological point of view , however , it is worth investigating the bifurcation curves as functions with respect to at least one of the geometrical parameters , for example : @xmath35 such kind of problems can be connected with the optimization of sizes of devices , containing jjs .",
    "most of our results below are related to the typical solution of bvp ( [ sg ] ) , physically existing both in homogeneous and inhomogeneous jjs : so called single fluxon .",
    "let us note that in the infinite homogeneous or inhomogeneous jj with one @xmath36-shaped microinhomogeneity at the point @xmath37 , the single fluxon / antifluxon is represented by the exact solution @xcite , @xcite : @xmath38    more complicated ( multi - fluxon ) solutions there exist in inhomogeneous jjs for big enough values of @xmath39 .",
    "the numerically obtained basic functions : the magnetic flux @xmath40 , the magnetic field @xmath41 , and the first eigenfunction @xmath42 of such solution for @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 are represented at fig .",
    "2 .    fig .",
    "3 represents the typical relationships @xmath47 , corresponding to the single fluxons in inhomogeneous junctions with one resistive inhomogeneity placed at the point @xmath37 when @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "the points @xmath50 and @xmath51 appear to be bifurcation points for these solutions , i.e. , the zeroes of the corresponding relationships @xmath52 . according to the above mentioned reasonings , these points determine the minimal length of the jj , for which the single fluxon is still stable for given values of the other parameters .",
    "figure 3    usually , from physical point of view , the concrete jj is  long \" or ",
    "one - dimensional \" if the josephson penetration depth @xmath53 satisfies the condition @xmath54 . however , such definition is not perfect enough mathematically . on the other hand",
    ", it seems that the calculation of the minimal geometrical sizes and , especially , the minimal length @xmath55 of homogeneous or inhomogeneous jjs , corresponding to a concrete nontrivial distribution of the magnetic flux , is an important practical problem .    the trivial method ,",
    "obviously , is through the point by point construction of the curves of type @xmath56 using bvps ( [ sg])-([norm ] ) .",
    "however , it is quite natural to put the question how to calculate directly the bifurcation curves .",
    "a general approach of study for the formulated problem is proposed in the papers @xcite .",
    "we consider the system of the equations ( [ sg ] ) , ( [ slp ] ) , and ( [ norm ] ) as a closed nonlinear eigenvalue problem with respect to the functions @xmath0 , @xmath57 and one of the parameters @xmath31 , for example , @xmath3 or @xmath4 in @xcite , or @xmath34 in this case , while the other parameters , and the eigenvalue @xmath58 as well , are given . fixing @xmath59 to be small enough ( for example @xmath60 ) , we guarantee a stable solution to be obtained .",
    "we note , that the derivative @xmath61 when @xmath62 approaches its critical ( bifurcation ) value , so , the solutions of the above system with a priori prescribed accuracy belong to the small vicinity of the sought bifurcation curve .",
    "the generalized continuous analog of newton s method @xcite for solving the mentioned system is used ( see details in our recent paper @xcite ) .",
    "we have to note that for some initial approximations the method can lead to an unstable solution , as well . in this case",
    ", the given @xmath63 corresponds to one of the higher eigenvalues , not to the minimal one .",
    "the simplest method to avoid this difficulty uses the oscillation theorem @xcite for eigenfunctions : _ if the obtained function @xmath64 is the minimal eigenfunction , then it does not have a zero on the interval @xmath55_.",
    "4 shows the convergence of the iteration process .",
    "the upper curve , marked by `` @xmath65 '' , presents the initial distribution of the magnetic field @xmath66 alongside the junction .",
    "this distribution is chosen to be a solution of bvp ( [ sg ] ) , for @xmath67 , @xmath44 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 . at the same figure the lower curve , marked by `` o '' ,",
    "presents the calculated distribution of the magnetic field corresponding to the minimal eigenvalue @xmath70 .",
    "hence , this is the sought bifurcation distribution and , in the framework of this model , the value of the spectral parameter @xmath71 is the minimal length of the junction , providing a stable single fluxon . in this sense , junctions , whose length lies below the critical value @xmath72 of @xmath55 , have to be considered as `` short '' for distributions @xmath40 of the kind single fluxon .",
    "however , for such a short length @xmath55 there are a unique stable and unstable distributions of the magnetic flux in the junction - meissner s solutions : the trivial solutions @xmath73 ( stable ) and @xmath74 ( unstable ) for @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "if the current @xmath75 and the values of all other parameters are fixed , then the stability of the fluxon requires the junction to be longer ( see fig . 5 ) .",
    "this fact corresponds to the classical conclusion @xcite that the existence of quantity @xmath2 violates the stability of the bound states in jjs .",
    "the  force \" @xmath2 displaces the maximum of @xmath41 from @xmath37 to the left or right depending on its sign ; the full magnetic flux @xmath76 increases , so that the minimal junction s length @xmath72 , necessary to accommodate such a flux , increases as well .",
    "the numerically obtained influence of the current @xmath2 upon the bifurcation length @xmath72 is plotted on fig.6 for two values of the size @xmath8 of the inhomogeneity : @xmath48 and @xmath44 .",
    "the curves increase very abruptly and when @xmath2 approaches some critical value , the derivative @xmath77 .",
    "this behaviour means that beyond the critical value of @xmath2 , jjs which correspond to the single fluxon do not exist .      on the contrary , if the boundary magnetic field @xmath78 and varies within some fixed domain , then the stability of the fluxon is improved ( see fig .",
    "well noticeable is the stabilizing influence of the boundary magnetic field @xmath39 upon the critical length of the junction , i.e. , the increase of the magnitude of @xmath39 decreases the minimal length of the junction @xmath72 .",
    "thus , the calculated minimal length of the jj corresponding to the single fluxon ( @xmath79 @xmath69 ) is @xmath80 , while the same quantity when @xmath81 and @xmath69 is @xmath82 .",
    "fig.8 represents the distributions of magnetic field @xmath66 alongside the junction in absence of current ( @xmath69 ) depending on its boundary values @xmath68 and @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "it is clear that the two solutions could be well approximated by means of two - degree polynomials .",
    "furthermore , they seem to be geometrically similar .",
    "namely , the curve @xmath66 corresponding to a magnetic field @xmath83 may be considered as obtained from the other curve by a homothety alongside @xmath23 axis with respect to the pole @xmath84 and a translation alongside the axis @xmath85 .      at the next fig.9 ,",
    "the dependence of the minimal length @xmath72 on the boundary magnetic field @xmath39 for @xmath86 in the case of a homogeneous jj ( the amplitude @xmath87 ) is presented . even though this dependence is qualitatively similar with the analogous ones at fig.7 , it differs from the big slope of @xmath72 for small @xmath39 , so that @xmath88 when @xmath89 .",
    "such behaviour of the curve @xmath90 can be qualitatively explained by means of the formula @xcite : @xmath91 , \\label { theor}\\ ] ] which is exact for the single fluxon ( [ single ] ) in an infinite jj with one resistive @xmath36-shaped inhomogeneity at the center @xmath84 .",
    "hence , for @xmath92 we obtain @xmath93 , so that for @xmath45 and @xmath94 the single fluxon in homogeneous jj has to be considered as a quasi - stable ( bifurcation ) state of the magnetic flux @xmath40 @xcite . on the contrary , in inhomogeneous jj with resistive inhomogeneities",
    "the single fluxon is still stable ( @xmath95 ) , which physically is due to the existence of the inhomogeneity .    in the case of an inhomogeneous jj with finite length @xmath96 the calculated curve @xmath97 ( marked by  @xmath98 \" ) for @xmath45 and @xmath46 is shown at fig.10 .",
    "we note that for small enough values of the size @xmath8 the dependence is analogous to ( [ theor ] ) .",
    "let us introduce the full energy @xmath99 connected with some solution @xmath40 of bvp ( [ sg ] ) via the formula : @xmath100 dx + h_b \\left [ \\varphi(r ) - \\varphi(-r ) \\right].\\ ] ] it is efficient to compare the energy curves @xmath101 ( marked by",
    " @xmath102 \" ) for fixed @xmath96 and @xmath103 ( marked by  @xmath104 \" ) for a jj with minimal length ( see fig .",
    ". the magnitudes of the energy are regarded to the energy ( @xmath105 ) of the single fluxon ( [ single ] ) in an infinite homogeneous jj .",
    "it is well noticeable that for @xmath106 the inequality @xmath107 is satisfied , e.g. , the single fluxon in the jj with minimal length is more stable .",
    "the cusp for @xmath92 corresponds to a bufurcation in accordance with formula ( [ theor ] ) .        at fig.11 the numerically obtained relationship @xmath108",
    "is drawn , depending on the length of the trapezium s base @xmath12 ( width of the inhomogeneity ) ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the presented three curves corresponding to different locations of the centre of inhomogeneity @xmath7 are qualitatively similar .",
    "the most important their feature is the existence of minimums , which are placed in the interval @xmath109 .",
    "therefore , there exist such values of the quantity @xmath8 , which provide a minimal bifurcation length of a jj from among all the minimal lengths for given other parameters .",
    "let us call them  optimal \" lengths .",
    "for example , if @xmath110 (  symmetric \" inhomogeneous jj ) , the optimal length @xmath111 of the jj corresponds to @xmath112 , whereas @xmath113 if the width of the inhomogeneity is @xmath114 , and @xmath115 for @xmath116 .",
    "the bifurcations of the bound states in the circular jjs with respect to the location @xmath7 of the @xmath36-shaped inhomogeneity are investigated numerically in @xcite .",
    "fig.12 shows the curves @xmath117 describing the behaviour of the minimal length of the linear jjs . when the current @xmath94 and the width of inhomogeneity @xmath118 is fixed , the curve is symmetric and , apparently , the minimal value of @xmath72 is reached at the location @xmath37 . when the current becomes nontrivial ( @xmath119 ) , the minimum shifts into some other point . for negative values of @xmath2",
    "the dependence is the same but mirror reflected with respect to the line @xmath37 .",
    "finally , the last fig.13 provides as an illustration a three - soliton bifurcation solution .",
    "such kind of solutions can be obtained when the boundary magnetic field @xmath39 is big enough . here , the concrete solution is derived for @xmath120 . at the same graph the initial distribution of the magnetic field @xmath41 as solution of bvp ( [ sg ] ) , for @xmath121 , @xmath69 , and @xmath44 is included .",
