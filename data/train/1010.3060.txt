    "<S> the reason why we choose to define  with a gap promise rather than with a grace interval is the same as for , namely to have a unique outcome associated with any input .    similarly , the idea of the hamiltonian formulation of the problem which we will discuss below is to ask for the number of eigenstates in a certain energy interval , where states which are in some small @xmath26 neighborhood of this interval may be miscounted ; again , for reasons of rigor we choose to consider only hamiltonians with no eigenstates in that interval . </S>",

    "<S> , we need to start from an arbitrary verifier circuit @xmath4 and construct a hamiltonian which has as many ground states as the circuit has accepting inputs ( corresponding to the outcome @xmath61 on the first qubit ) . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath44 and @xmath45 be the eigenspaces of @xmath32 [ eq .  ] with eigenvalues @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively , and define @xmath64:=\\{u{\\lvert\\psi\\rangle}_i{{\\lvert\\bm{0}\\rangle}_a}:{\\lvert\\psi\\rangle}_i\\in \\mathcal r\\}$ ] .    </S>",
    "<S> we will follow kitaev s original construction for a hamiltonian encoding a verifier circuit  @xcite , which for any proof @xmath65 has the `` proof history '' @xmath66 as its ground state , where the third register is used as a clock . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian @xmath67 has three types of terms : @xmath68 makes sure the ancilla is initialized , @xmath69 ensures proper evolution from @xmath70 to @xmath71 , and @xmath72}\\otimes { { \\lvert{t}\\rangle\\!\\langle{t}\\rvert}}_t$ ] gives an energy penalty to states @xmath73 built from proofs @xmath74 . note that our @xmath75 differs from the usual choice @xmath76 and </S>",
    "<S> is in fact non - local ; as we show in the supplementary material , this does not significantly change the relevant spectral properties ( in particular , we keep the @xmath26 gap , and the ground state subspace is split at most exponentially ) . with this choice of @xmath75 , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath25 acts independently on the subspaces spanned by @xmath77 for any @xmath78 or @xmath79 , and @xmath80 the computational basis , and the restriction of @xmath25 to any of these subspaces describes a random walk which is characterized by the choice of @xmath7 and the number of @xmath12 s in @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> these cases can be analyzed independently ( see supplementary material ) , and it follows that @xmath25 has a @xmath81-fold degenerate ground state space with a @xmath26 gap above , proving -hardness of # lh .    </S>",
    "<S> this shows that # lh  is -hard for a hamiltonian which is a sum of @xmath82-local terms ( i.e. , each term acts on @xmath82 sites ) , as the clock register is of size @xmath82 . in order to obtain a @xmath83-body hamiltonian , </S>",
    "<S> kitaev suggested to use a unary encoding of the clock ( i.e. , @xmath84 is encoded as @xmath85 , with @xmath71 1 s ) , so that each hamiltonian term only acts on three qubits of the clock . </S>",
    "<S> however , this makes the hilbert space of the clock too big , and terms need to be added to the hamiltonian to penalize illegal clock configurations . </S>",
    "<S> these terms divide the hilbert space into two parts , @xmath86 . here , @xmath87 contains only legal clock states , whereas @xmath88 contains only configurations with illegal clock states  @xcite . since no hamiltonian term couples these two subspaces , the hamiltonian can be analyzed independently on the two subspaces . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that its restriction to @xmath88 has an at least @xmath26 higher energy , while on @xmath87 , the hamiltonian is exactly the same as before . </S>",
    "<S> thus , one finds that the new hamiltonian still has the right number of ground states , and a @xmath26 spectral gap . </S>",
    "<S> the very same argument applies in the case of 1d hamiltonians , using the -construction of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite : again , the hamiltonian acts independently on a `` legal '' and an `` illegal '' subspace , where the latter has a polynomially larger energy , and the former reproduces the ( low - energy ) spectrum of the original hamiltonian  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> an alternative way to prove -hardness on restricted interaction graphs is to use so - called _ perturbation gadgets _ , which yield the hamiltonian of the kitaev construction above from a perturbative expansion ; in particular , this way one can show -hardness of pauli - type nearest - neighbor hamiltonians on a 2d square lattice of qubits  @xcite . as shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , such gadgets do in fact approximately preserve the whole low - energy part of the spectrum , and thus , our hardness proof for # lh  still applies to these classes of hamiltonians . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted , however , that since the eigenvalues are only preserved up to an error @xmath26 , the splitting of the ground state space will now be of order @xmath26 ; however , it can still be chosen to be polynomially smaller than the spectral gap .    _ _ quantum vs.  classical counting complexity.__as we have seen , the quantum counting class exactly captures the difficulty of counting the degeneracy of ground states and computing the density of states of local quantum hamiltonians . in the following , we will relate to classical counting classes and prove that is equal to , counting the number of satisfying inputs to a boolean function   there exist polynomial - time computable functions @xmath89 and @xmath90 , and a function @xmath91 , such that @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> this differs from karp reductions where no postprocessing is allowed , @xmath93 , but it still only requires a single call to a oracle . ] . in physical terms </S>",
    "<S> , this shows that counting the number of ground states or determining the density of states for a quantum hamiltonian is not harder than either problem is for a classical hamiltonian .    </S>",

    "<S> it remains to be shown that any problem can be solved by computing a function . </S>",
    "<S> we start from a verifier operator @xmath32 , eq .  , and wish to show that the dimension of its accepting subspace , i.e. , the subspace @xmath44 with eigenvalues @xmath35 , can be computed by counting satisfying inputs to some efficiently computable boolean function . using amplification </S>",
    "<S> , we can ensure that @xmath94 , i.e. , we need to compute @xmath95 to accuracy @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be done using a `` path integral '' method , which has been used previously to show containments of quantum classes in the classical classes and  ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we rewrite @xmath97 as a sum over products of transition probabilities along a path @xmath98 , where @xmath99{{\\lvert{i_t}\\rangle\\!\\langle{i_t}\\rvert } }           u_t \\cdots   u_1   { \\lverti_0\\rangle}_i { { \\lvert\\bm{0}\\rangle}_a}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( cf .  </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f : circuit ] ) . since any such sum over an efficiently computable @xmath100 can be determined by counting the satisfying inputs to some boolean formula ( see the supplementary material for details ) , it follows that @xmath32 can be computed using a single query to a black box solving problems .    </S>",
    "<S> _ _ summary and discussion.__in this work , we considered two problems : computing the density of states and computing the ground state degeneracy of a local hamiltonian of a spin system . in order to capture the computational difficulty of these problems we introduced the quantum complexity class , the counting version of the class . </S>",
    "<S> we proved that this complexity class exactly captures the difficulty of our two problems , even when restricting to local hamiltonians on 2d lattices of qubits or to 1d chains , since all these problems are complete problems for the class  .    </S>",
    "<S> we have further shown that is no harder than its classical counterpart . in particular </S>",
    "<S> this implies that computing the density of states is no harder for quantum hamiltonians than it is for classical ones . </S>",
    "<S> while this quantum - classical equivalence might seem surprising at the hamiltonian level , it should be noted that the classes and quite often form natural `` upper bounds '' for many quantum _ and _ classical problems .    what about the problem of computing the density of states for fermionic systems , such as many - electron systems ? </S>",
    "<S> on the one hand , this problem will be still in and thus , since any local fermionic hamiltonian can be mapped via the jordan - wigner transform to a ( non - local ) hamiltonian on a spin system , whose energy can still be estimated efficiently by a quantum circuit  @xcite . on the other hand , hardness of the problem for  can be shown e.g.  by using the -hardness of # lh , and encoding each spin using one fermion in two modes , similar to  @xcite . </S>",
