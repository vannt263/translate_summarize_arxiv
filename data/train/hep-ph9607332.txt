    "the hadronic matrix element of weak @xmath0 transition ( @xmath2 : pseudoscalar meson ) is described by two form factors , whereas in general it requires four form factors to parametrize the weak matrix element for @xmath1 transition ( @xmath3 : vector meson ) .",
    "heavy quark symmetry predicts that , all the mesonic form factors in the infinite quark mass limit @xmath4 are related to a single universal isgur - wise function @xcite .",
    "the symmerty breaking @xmath5 corrections can be studied in a systematic framework , namely the heavy quark effective theory ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "the isgur - wise function is normalized to unity at zero recoil , but otherwise remains unknown .",
    "phenomenologically , the hadronic form factors can be evaluated in various models among which the quark model is a popular one . however , since usual quark - model wave functions best resemble meson states in the rest frame or where the meson velocities are small , hence the form factors calculated in non - relativistic quark model or the mit bag model are trustworthy only when the recoil momentum of the daughter meson relative to the parent meson is small .    as the recoil momentum increases ( corresponding to a decreasing @xmath6 )",
    ", we have to start considering relativistic effects seriously .",
    "in particular , at the maximum recoil point @xmath7 where the final meson could be highly relativistic , there is no reason to expect that the non - relativistic quark model is still applicable .",
    "a consistent treatment of the relativistic effects of the quark motion and spin in a bound state is a main issue of the relativistic quark model . to our knowledge",
    ", the light - front quark model @xcite is the only relativistic quark model in which a consistent and fully relativistic treatment of quark spins and the center - of - mass motion can be carried out .",
    "this model has many advantages .",
    "for example , the light - front wave function is manifestly lorentz invariant as it is expressed in terms of the momentum fraction variables ( in  + \" components ) in analog to the parton distributions in the infinite momentum frame .",
    "moreover , hadron spin can also be correctly constructed using the so - called melosh rotation .",
    "the kinematic subgroup of the light - front formalism has the maximum number of interaction - free generators including the boost operator which describes the center - of - mass motion of the bound state ( for a review of the light - front dynamics and light - front qcd , see @xcite ) .",
    "the light - front quark model has been applied in the past to study the heavy - to - heavy and heavy - to - light weak decays form factors @xcite .",
    "however , the weak form factors were calculated only for @xmath8 , whereas physical decays occur in the time - like region @xmath9 , with @xmath10 being the initial and final meson masses .",
    "hence extra assumptions are needed to extrapolate the form factors to cover the entire range of momentum transfer . in @xcite",
    "an ansatz for the @xmath6 dependence was made to extrapolate the form factors in the space - like region to the time - like region .",
    "based on the dispersion formulation , form factors at @xmath11 were obtained in @xcite by performing an analytic continuation from the space - like @xmath6 region . finally , the weak form factors for @xmath0 transition were calculated in @xcite for the first time for the entire range of @xmath6 , so that additional extrapolation assumptions are no longer required .",
    "this is based on the observation @xcite that in the frame where the momentum transfer is purely longitudinal , i.e. , @xmath12 , @xmath13 covers the entire range of momentum transfer .",
    "the price one has to pay is that , besides the conventional valence - quark contribution , one must also consider the non - valence configuration ( or the so - called @xmath14-graph ) arising from quark - pair creation from the vacuum ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the non - valence contribution vanishes if @xmath15 , but is supposed to be important for heavy - to - light transition near zero recoil @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , a reliable way of estimating the @xmath14-graph contribution is still lacking .    in the present paper",
    "we calculate the @xmath1 form factors directly at time - like momentum transfers for the first time .",
    "we then study the mesonic form factors in the infinite quark mass limit to check if the light - front model calculations respect heavy quark symmetry .",
    "we are able to compute the isgur - wise function exactly since the non - valence contribution vanishes in the heavy - quark limit .",
    "it turns out that not all light - front wave functions give a correct normalization for the isgur - wise function at zero recoil in @xmath1 decay . in other words , the requirement of heavy quark symmetry",
    "can be utilized to rule out certain phenomenological wave functions .",
    "another issue we would like to address in this work has to do with reference frame dependence of form factor . for a given @xmath6",
    ", one can choose whether the recoiling daughter meson moves in the positive or negative @xmath16-direction relative to the parent meson , which we call the  + \" and  @xmath17 \" reference frame , respectively .",
    "for some form factors in @xmath1 transition , namely @xmath18 , valence - quark and non - valence contributions are separately dependent on the choice of the  + \" or ",
    "@xmath17 \" frame , but their sum should not .",
    "this demonstrates the fact that it is mandatory to take into account the non - valence configuration in order to have physical predictions for form factors .",
    "this issue will be discussed in more details in sections  iid and ivc .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the basic theoretical formalism is given and form factors for @xmath0 and @xmath1 transitions are derived .",

    "we will describe in this section the light - front approach for the calculation of the weak mesonic form factors for pseudoscalar - to - pseudoscalar and pseudoscalar - to - vector transitions .",
    "the hadronic matrix elements will be evaluated at time - like momentum transfers , namely the physically accessible kinematic region @xmath19 .    a meson bound state consisting of a quark @xmath20 and an antiquark @xmath21 with total momentum @xmath2 and spin @xmath22",

    "however , before such first - principles solutions are available , we would have to be contented with phenomenological amplitudes .",
    "one example that has been often used in the literature for heavy mesons is the so - called bauer - stech - wirbel ( bsw ) amplitude@xcite , which for a meson of mass @xmath48 is given by @xmath49 ,                  \\label{bswamp}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is a normalization constant , @xmath51 is the longitudinal momentum fraction carried by the light antiquark , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is a parameter of order @xmath54 .",
    "an other example is the gaussian - type wave function , @xmath55 where @xmath56 , and @xmath57 of the internal momentum @xmath58 is defined through @xmath59 with @xmath60 .",
    "we then have m_0=e_1 + e_2 ,  k_z = xm_02-m_2 ^ 2+k_^2 2 xm_0 , [ kz ] and @xmath61 is the jacobian of transformation from @xmath28 to @xmath62 .",
    "this wave function has been also used in many other studies of hadronic transitions .",
    "in particular , with appropriate parameters , it describes satisfactorily the pion elastic form factor up to @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "a variant of the gaussian - type wave function is ( x , k_)=n(-m_0 ^ 22 ^ 2 ) , [ variant ] with @xmath64 being given by ( [ m0 ] ) .",
    "this amplitude is equivalent to @xmath65 when the constituent quark masses are equal but becomes different otherwise .",
    "nevertheless , we will not pursue this wave function further because it does not have an appropriate heavy - quark - limit behavior ( see sec .",
    "iii ) .    obviously , the isgur - wise function for heavy meson transitions depends on the heavy meson wave function @xmath66 chosen .",
    "it turns out that in contrast to the gaussian - type wave function , the bsw wave function fails to give a correct normalization for the isgur - wise function at zero recoil in @xmath1 transition .",
