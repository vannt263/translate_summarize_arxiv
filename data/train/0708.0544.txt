    "since their introduction in 1965 by montroll and weiss  @xcite , continuous - time random walks ( ctrw s ) have been applied to virtually any field in which one wants to capture the smallest - scale properties of a given random system , and finance is not an exception .",
    "in fact , an intense activity in this area have been developed in recent years , as it can be inferred from the extensive ( and exhaustive ) list of references included in the review that scalas  @xcite published in 2006 .",
    "however , most of the work involving ctrw models was intended to reproduce empirical statistical properties , like probability density function ( pdf ) of returns  @xcite , or the mean exit time of the process out of a given region  @xcite .",
    "the amount of such articles that deal with problems with some application on option pricing , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , is not so large instead .    in this article",
    "we present pricing expressions for several perpetual american options .",
    "the results were obtained by applying standard ctrw techniques on a market model whose time evolution is step - like .",
    "the fact is that _ option pricing when underlying stock returns are discontinuous _ is not a new problem at all  @xcite , and it is under active research nowadays in mathematical finance  @xcite .",
    "the main differences between these approaches are twofold : we do not assume either that the process evolution is diffusive between changes , ctrw collects * all * the stochastic ( tick - by - tick ) dynamics , nor transactions constitute necessarily a * poisson process*. this might allow us to explore inefficient market models .",
    "when a risk - neutral market evolution can be defined we obtain fair option prices , from which classical black - scholes ( bs ) results can be recovered .",
    "we will model the market evolution of stock prices , @xmath0 , through the logarithmic return @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "we will assume that the stochastic process follows the most common version of the ctrw : @xmath2 shows a series of random increments or jumps at random times @xmath3 , the transaction times , remaining constant between these jumps .",
    "therefore , the resulting trajectory consists of a series of steps as shown in fig .",
    "[ model ] .",
    "we will assume that waiting times , @xmath4 , and random returns , @xmath5 , are ( mutually ) independent and identically distributed random variables , described by two pdf s which we will denote by @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively .",
    "process along with the corresponding value of the random variable @xmath8 , the exercise time.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    a key magnitude in the ctrw formalism is the propagator , @xmath9 , the pdf of @xmath10 when one knows the value of the process right after a jump , @xmath11 . under our previous assumptions",
    "the propagator fulfils a renewal equation  @xcite that can be readily solved in the fourier - laplace domain : @xmath12 where tildes and hats stand for fourier and laplace transforms respectively .",
    "options are contracts between two parties , sold by one party to another , that give the buyer the right , but not the obligation , to buy ( call ) or sell ( put ) shares of the underlying stock at some prearranged price , the _ strike _ price @xmath13 , within a certain period or on a specific date , the maturity or expiration time @xmath14 .",
    "therefore options are contingent claims with their present value determined by the discounted value of the expected profit under a * risk - neutral measure * : @xmath15 , \\label{option_price}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the risk - free interest rate , @xmath8 is the actual exercise time , @xmath17 is the pay - off function , and @xmath18 condenses the available information up to time @xmath19 .",
    "we will concentrate our attention on pay - off functions of the current value of the asset , like in the case of _ vanilla _ calls ( + ) and puts ( - ) where @xmath20 { \\mathbf 1}_{s(\\tau ) \\gtrless   k } , \\label{payv}\\ ] ] and @xmath13 is constant .",
    "another broadly used pay - off is @xmath21 , which corresponds to binary or digital call and put options .",
    "when the option can be exercised at the end of the contract lifetime solely , @xmath22 , the option is said to be european .",
    "if the option can be exercised at any time before expiration it is called american , and @xmath8 becomes a stochastic magnitude .",
    "since the contract becomes worthless after maturity the option holder must find , under this constraint , the optimal exercise boundary , @xmath23 : the stock price above ( below ) which it is better to exercise the call ( put ) than to keep the option alive .",
    "we will define the exercise time @xmath24 as the first time the underlying crosses the threshold given that at present time , @xmath25 , the spot price of the asset , @xmath26 , lies in the proper side of the boundary : @xmath27 note that here the boundary function @xmath23 has to be assessed _ while _ solving the whole problem : the option price must always be greater or equal than the pay - off function , otherwise you can readily buy the option and execute it just afterwards , thus obtaining risk - free earnings",
    ". therefore @xmath28 must be settled in such a way that @xmath29 holds  @xcite .",
    "we must stress again that eq .",
    "( [ option_price ] ) leads to the right option price from the financial point of view if we use a risk - neutral measure . under such market measure , and when the underlying stock pays no dividend , we must have @xmath30=y({s_0},t_0)$ ] , for any quoted quantity in the market .",
    "in particular @xmath31=c({s_0},t_0)$ ] , which is true by construction , and @xmath32={s_0}$ ] .",
    "condition  @xcite for the risk - neutral evolution of the asset implies that our propagator must fulfil that : @xmath33 if we put this expression into eq .",
    "( [ hat_tilde ] ) we will arrive to the conclusion that waiting times ought to be exponentially distributed , @xmath34 , with @xmath35 let us analyse the consequences of our previous results . the physical measure and the risk - neutral measure may differ , but they must describe the same kind of process .",
    "this means that , if the number of actual market transactions does not follow a poisson distribution , we will not be able to define a risk - neutral market measure , and the market will become * inefficient * , because then the ctrw has memory and it is not markovian .",
    "conversely , if waiting times _ have _ an exponential pdf , the risk - neutral market measure can be obtained after imposing eq .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) .",
    "note however that eq .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) _ is not _ a definition for @xmath36 , but a constraint that involves all the physical parameters , as we will show below in a practical example .",
    "this is a typical feature of * incomplete * market models .",
    "perpetual options , i.e. derivatives with @xmath37 , are not actual traded contracts .",
    "however , they have practical interest because they represent the limiting value of a far - from - maturity contract , and therefore they may help in the pricing process if the theoretical price can not be computed  @xcite which is the most common situation for american options .",
    "moreover , from a pure academic point of view , perpetual american options bring a major simplification to the issue : the optimal exercise boundary is constant @xmath38 , given that the problem is stationary .",
    "then we have : @xmath39 .   \\ ] ] observe that , since the process is discontinuous , the actual value of the stock price when we execute the option call ( put ) will be greater ( lower ) than @xmath40 .",
    "therefore @xmath41 is random in general .",
    "this is not the case for binary option prices , @xmath42 , because @xmath43 and @xmath44 : @xmath45=1-r\\widehat\\phi_{{k_0 } } ^ \\pm   \\left ( { s = r;x_0 } \\right ) .   \\ ] ] here we have introduced the complementary distribution function of @xmath46 , @xmath47 which , within the ctrw formalism , is usually referred as the survival probability ( sp ) , @xmath48 } ( t - t_0 ; x_0 ) $ ] .",
    "the sp measures the likelihood that a process beginning in a given region @xmath49 $ ] remains there all the time interval @xmath50 .",
    "in all the cases we are dealing with , one of the boundaries of the region is infinite .",
    "however , from a practical point of view , it is better to obtain the result for a finite region first , and compute the right limits afterwards .",
    "the laplace transform of the sp fulfils by itself a renewal equation  @xcite that can not be solved for a general kernel @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , we need to specify a functional form for the jump pdf , and we have focused our attention on the asymmetric two - sided exponential case , @xmath51 .",
    "\\label{h}\\ ] ] this model is very suitable for our purposes for two main reasons . on the one hand , we can eventually recover the bs results in a certain limit . and",

    "the two formulas coincide for small values of the mean sojourn time @xmath62 , for which we can expand @xmath63 , and for large values of @xmath64 and @xmath65 , once one identifies @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "in this section we will present results for the jump pdf in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) when we have adopted a risk - neutral market measure , that is @xmath34 .",
    "we will proceed by replacing @xmath36 according to eq .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) .",
    "this choice is feasible only when @xmath68 , because we need @xmath69 to be bounded , and @xmath36 must be positive definite : @xmath70 the above conditions simplify the values of @xmath71 and @xmath72 , after we have set @xmath73 , and lead to the following expressions for the _ live _ binary call ( @xmath74 ) and put ( @xmath75 ) option prices : , because it is merely formal . ]",
    "@xmath76 note that in both cases the prices are discontinuous , since @xmath77 .",
    "this feature disappears when considering continuous trading , @xmath78 .",
    "we can approach to this limit by letting @xmath79 and @xmath80 , but in such a way that the difference remains finite @xmath81 .",
    "in fact , in this case we recover the bs prices  @xcite , since then @xmath82 , and @xmath83 .",
    "we can now consider the usual _ vanilla _ pay - off which we introduced in eq .",
    "( [ payv ] ) .",
    "the problem here is that , as we advanced in section  [ sect_aosp ] , @xmath41 is a random magnitude .",
    "when @xmath7 follows eq .",

    "then the _ vanilla _ option price @xmath85 can be easily computed : @xmath86 in terms of @xmath40 .",
    "when we impose condition  ( [ continuity ] ) on @xmath87 we obtain an inconsistent expression for finite values of @xmath88 and the option is never exercised , @xmath89 . when we demand @xmath90 , in turn , we get @xmath91 the continuous - trading limit leads again to the bs formula  @xcite , as it can be observed in fig .  [ vanillaplot ] . there",
    "we represent put option prices for different values of @xmath64 and @xmath65 . in order to reach the diffusive limit for a given choice of @xmath16 and @xmath60 ,",
    "we have imposed the relationship @xmath92 .    .",
    "we show several plots of _ vanilla _ puts in terms of the moneyness @xmath93 , after setting @xmath94 , and @xmath95 .",
    "we have also represented the bs price for @xmath96 and @xmath97.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]",
    "we have argued for the convenience of the use of ctrw s in the modelling of stochastic processes in finance .",
    "ctrw is a well suited tool for representing market changes at the lower time scale , the transaction - to - transaction evolution .",
    "we have shown how ctrw - based results can be easily adapted to financial terminology with little effort .",
    "in particular , we have analysed their possible applications in option pricing problems , by relating the computation of survival probabilities with the price of perpetual american derivatives for the two most ubiquitous flavours : binary options and _ vanilla _ options .",
    "we have considered risk - neutral scenarios for which we have obtained results that are fair from the financial point of view .",
    "moreover , we have shown how classical bs results can be obtained from these expressions under certain limits .",
    "finally , we have pointed out that our approach may be fruitful in the future in exploring a particular class of inefficient market models .",
    "there are multiple evidences  @xcite pointing to the fact that transactions are not exponentially distributed .",
    "in such a case the ctrw machinery may be very helpful in providing solutions for a general pausing time distribution ."
