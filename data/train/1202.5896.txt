    "a classical problem in planar polynomial vector fields starting from poincar is the _ center - focus problem_. the problem asks for the determination of mechanisms leading to the creation of a center ( a singularity surrounded by a continuous family of closed orbits ) rather than a focus ( singularity attracting or repelling all nearby trajectories ) .",
    "the problem has not yet been solved in a satisfactory way except for quadratic vector fields @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the _ center - focus problem _ has its _ infinitesimal version _ : starting from a vector field @xmath11 having a center , find all perturbations @xmath12 preserving the center .",
    "more generally , given a vector field @xmath11 having a continuous family @xmath13 of closed orbits , determine the deformations @xmath12 of @xmath11 preserving these closed orbits .",
    "that is , we ask the deformed family @xmath14 of orbits of @xmath12 to be _ closed _ , too .",
    "taking a parametrized transversal @xmath15 to the family of closed curves @xmath16 , one defines the _ displacement map _ @xmath17 as the first return map minus identity along trajectories of @xmath12 .",
    "then , a continuous family of closed curves is preserved , if the displacement map of the deformation along the chosen family of closed curves is identically zero .",
    "the most popular family of polynomial systems having a continuous family of closed orbits is the family of hamiltonian vector fields @xmath18 .",
    "the trajectories of @xmath19 lie in the level curves of the hamiltonian .",
    "consider their deformations @xmath20 . taking a transversal @xmath15 to a family @xmath16 of closed curves of the hamiltonian vector field @xmath19 parametrized by @xmath21 ,",
    "the displacement function of the above deformation is of the form    @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the dual form to the vector field @xmath24 and @xmath25 is a function depending on @xmath26 , but tending to zero faster then @xmath27 , for @xmath28 .",
    "the function @xmath29 , @xmath30 , is an _",

    "ilyashenko @xcite proves that by monodromy one family of cycles generates all cycles .",
    "hence the vanishing of abelian integrals along one family of cycles implies the vanishing along all cycles and the two problems coincide .",

    "integration is just calculation of the value of a function at some points @xmath47 determining the cycle @xmath48 ( for more details see the next section ) .",
    "note that in this case @xmath42-dimensional abelian integrals are in fact algebraic functions , so the problem is certainly easier than the initial problem .",
    "nevertheless , in @xcite , we showed that the tangential center problem for the hyper - elliptic case is directly related to the above 0-dimensional tangential center problem for hyper - elliptic abelian integrals , ( see also gavrilov and pakovich @xcite ) .",

    "we called such a cycle _ totally unbalanced_. the main result from @xcite can be resumed by saying that under the hypothesis that the cycle @xmath43 is totally unbalanced , the only mechanism producing tangential centers is a composition ( i.e. symmetry ) mechanism or a sum of composition mechanisms .",
    "our proof was based on results of pakovich - muzychuk relative to the composition conjecture in the moment problem for the abel equation . in particular",
    "we used pakovich - muzychuk s characterization of invariant irreducible spaces .    in this paper",
    "we deal with the remaining case of balanced cycles or cycles leading to balanced cycles in the induction process .",
    "we solve by induction the @xmath42-dimensional tangential center problem for arbitrary cycles , but under a hypothesis on the polynomial @xmath44 .",
    "we explain this hypothesis .",
    "it follows from the burnside - schur theorem that primitive ( i.e. , undecomposable ) composition factors of a polynomial @xmath44 are of one of the following three types : @xmath10-transitive , linearly equivalent to a monomial @xmath49 or a chebyshev polynomial @xmath50 , with @xmath51 prime .",

    "we prove that under the above hypothesis , the decomposition of @xmath44 as @xmath52 is unique .",
    "the hypothesis of non - merging of critical values allow us to decompose the monodromy group of @xmath57 in a semidirect product of the monodromy group of @xmath58 and the monodromy group of @xmath9 . under these hypotheses ,",
    "we solve recursively the @xmath42-dimensional tangential center problem . using new methods ,",
    "we show that in addition to the composition mechanisms , two new mechanisms leading to tangential centers exist .",
    "they both appear for balanced cycles on the level of the basis of recursion and in the recursion step .",
    "one mechanism is related to primality of monomial or chebyshev polynomial factors with the characteristic polynomial @xmath59 associated to the cycle @xmath60 .",
    "it is described by ( 1 ) of theorem [ theo : inductionsptep ] ( basis ) and theorem [ theo : main2 ] ( recursive step ) .",
    "the other mechanism is related to the vanishing of the newton - girard component on projected cycles in the case of @xmath10-transitive factors .",
    "it is described by ( 2 ) of theorem [ theo : inductionsptep ] ( basis ) and theorem [ theo : main ] ( recursive step ) .",
    "the motivation of the tangential center problem for the abel equation @xmath61 proposed by briskin , franoise and yomdin in a series of papers  @xcite-@xcite , was to obtain general mechanisms for the existence of centers . for @xmath62 polynomials ,",
    "the tangential center problem has been totally solved by pakovich and muzychuk  @xcite proving that there is a tangential center if and only if @xmath63 can be written as a sum of polynomials having a common factor with @xmath64 .",
    "moreover , briskin , roytvarf and yomdin  @xcite have proved that composition ( just one summand ) generates all centers of at infinity except for a finite number of exceptional cases . nevertheless , there are centers and tangential centers for which composition is not the generating mechanism , like when @xmath62 are not polynomials ( see @xcite ) or , in a more general context , ( hyperelliptic ) planar systems ( see example 9.2 of @xcite ) .",
