    "radiative heat transfer is a topic with numerous fundamental and technological implications across disciplines @xcite .",
    "presently , the investigation of radiative heat transfer between closely spaced objects is receiving a great attention @xcite .",
    "the basic challenges now are the understanding of the mechanisms governing thermal radiation at the nanoscale and the ability to control this radiation for its use in novel applications . during a long time",
    ", it was believed that the maximum radiative heat transfer between two objects was set by the stefan - boltzmann law for black bodies .",
    "however , this is only true when objects are separated by distances larger than the thermal wavelength ( 9.6 @xmath1 m at room temperature ) and the radiative heat transfer is dominated by propagating waves .",
    "when two objects are brought in closer proximity , the thermal radiation is dominated by interference effects and , more importantly , by the near field emerging from the materials surfaces in the form of evanescent waves .",
    "this was first established theoretically by polder and van hove in 1971 @xcite using rytov s framework of fluctuational electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "these researchers predicted that the nfrht could overcome the black body limit by several orders of magnitude , achieving what is referred to as super - planckian thermal emission .",
    "although this nfrht enhancement was already hinted in several experiments in the late 1960 s @xcite , its unambiguous confirmation came only in recent years @xcite .",
    "these experiments , in turn , have triggered off the hope that nfrht may have an impact in different technologies such as heat - assisted magnetic recording @xcite , thermal lithography @xcite , scanning thermal microscopy @xcite , coherent thermal sources @xcite , near - field based thermal management @xcite , thermophotovoltaics @xcite and other energy conversion devices @xcite .",
    "presently , one of the central research lines in the field of radiative heat transfer is the search for materials where the nfrht enhancement can be further increased .",
    "so far , the largest enhancements have been experimentally reported in polar dielectrics @xcite , where the near - field thermal radiation is dominated by the excitation of surface phonon polaritons ( sphps ) @xcite .",
    "similar enhancements have been predicted and observed in doped semiconductors due to surface plasmon polaritons ( spps ) @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been predicted that hyperbolic metamaterials could behave as broadband super - planckian thermal emitters @xcite .",
    "hyperbolic metamaterials are a special class of highly anisotropic media that have hyperbolic dispersion .",
    "in particular , they are uniaxial materials for which one of the principal components of either the permittivity or the permeability tensors is opposite in sign to the other two principal components @xcite .",
    "hyperbolic media have been mainly realized by means of hybrid metal - dielectric superlattices and metallic nanowires embedded in a dielectric host @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that these metamaterials exhibit exotic optical properties such as negative refraction , subwavelength imaging and focusing , and they can be used to do density of states engineering @xcite . in the context of radiative heat transfer ,",
    "what makes these metamaterials so special is the fact that they can support electromagnetic modes that are evanescent in a vacuum gap , but they are propagating inside the material .",
    "this leads to a broadband enhancement of transmission efficiency of the evanescent modes @xcite .",
    "this special property has motivated a lot of theoretical work on the use of hyperbolic metamaterials for nfrht @xcite .",
    "however , no experimental investigation of this issue has been reported so far , which is mainly due to the difficulties in handling these metamaterials . in this sense",
    ", it would be highly desirable to find much simpler realizations of hyperbolic thermal emitters and , ideally , with tunable properties .",
    "another key issue in the field of radiative heat transfer is the active control and modulation of nfrht . in this respect ,",
    "several proposals have been put forward recently .",
    "one of the them is based on the use of phase - change materials @xcite , where the change of phase leads to a significant change in the material dielectric function .",
    "these materials include an alloy called aist , where the phase change can be induced by applying an electric field @xcite , and vo@xmath2 , which undergoes a metal - insulator transition as a function of temperature @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that the nfrht between chiral materials with magnetoelectric coupling can be tuned by ultrafast optical pulses @xcite .",
    "another proposal to tune the nfrht is to use ferroelectric materials under an external electric field @xcite , although the predicted changes are rather modest ( @xmath3% ) .",
    "let us also mention that very recently it has been proposed that the heat flux between two semiconductors can be controlled by regulating the chemical potential of photons by means of an external bias @xcite .",
    "so in short , although these proposals are certainly interesting , some of them are not easy to implement and others are either not very efficient or they are restricted to very specific materials . in this sense , the challenge remains to introduce strategies to actively control nfrht in an easy and relatively universal way .    in this work",
    "we tackle and resolve some of the open problems described above by presenting an extensive theoretical analysis of the influence of an external dc magnetic field in the radiative heat transfer between two parallel plates made of a variety of materials .",
    "we show that an applied magnetic field can indeed largely affect the nfrht in a broad class of materials , namely doped ( polar and non - polar ) semiconductors .",
    "we find that , irrespective of its orientation , the magnetic field reduces the nfrht with respect to the zero - field case and we show that the reduction can be as large as 700% for fields of about 6 t at room temperature .",
    "this effect originates from the fact that the magnetic field not only strongly modifies the surface waves that dominate the nfrht in doped semiconductors ( both sphps and spps ) , but it also generates broadband hyperbolic modes that tend to govern the heat transfer as the field is increased .",
    "in particular , when the applied field is perpendicular to the plates surfaces , the semiconductors behave as hyperbolic thermal emitters with highly tunable properties . by changing the field magnitude",
    "one can continuously tune the system and realize situations where ( i ) surface waves dominate the nfrht , ( ii ) both surface waves and hyperbolic modes contribute significantly to the near - field thermal radiation , and ( iii ) only hyperbolic modes contribute to the nfrht and surface waves cease to exist . on the other hand , when the field is parallel to the surfaces the nfrht is nonmonotonic as a function of the magnetic field . for moderate fields , surface waves and hyperbolic modes coexisting , while for high fields the nfrht",
    "is largely dominated by hyperbolic modes .",
    "we emphasize that all these striking predictions are amenable to measurements and do not require the use of any complicated metamaterial .",
    "thus , our work offers a simple strategy to actively control nfrht in a broad variety of materials and it also provides a very appealing recipe to realize hyperbolic materials and , in particular , hyperbolic thermal emitters with highly tunable properties .",
    "the remainder of this paper is structured as follows .",
    "section [ sec - ii ] describes the system under study and the general formalism for the description of nfrht in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "we then turn in sec .",
    "[ sec - iii ] to the application of the general results to the case of @xmath0-doped insb as an example of a polar semiconductor .",
    "we discuss in this section both the results for different magnetic field orientations and the realization of highly tunable hyperbolic thermal emitters .",
    "section [ sec - iii ] is devoted to the case of si as an example of non - polar semiconductor .",
    "section iv summarizes our main results and discusses future directions .",
    "finally , four appendixes contain the technical details of the general formalism and some additional calculations that support the claims in this paper .",
    "our main goal is to compute the radiative heat transfer in the presence of an external dc magnetic field within the framework of fluctuational electrodynamics @xcite . for simplicity",

    "( c ) the corresponding zero - field spectral heat flux as a function of frequency ( and wavelength ) for three different gaps . ]    when a magnetic field is applied to any object , it results in an optical anisotropy that can be described by the following general permittivity tensor @xcite @xmath8 where according to fig .",
    "[ scheme](a ) , @xmath9 and @xmath10 lie in the interface planes and @xmath11 corresponds to the surface normal .",
    "the components of the permittivity tensor depend on the applied magnetic field , as we shall specify below , and on the frequency ( local approximation ) .",

    "( [ perm - tensor ] ) are responsible for all the well - known magneto - optical effects ( faraday effect , kerr effects , etc . ) @xcite .",
    "thus , our problem is to compute the radiative heat transfer between two anisotropic parallel plates .",
    "this generic problem has been addressed by biehs _",

    "more importantly , we show explicitly how the different reflection matrices appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq - trans - man ] ) can be computed within a scattering - matrix approach for anisotropic multilayer systems .",
    "this approach provides , in turn , a natural framework to analyze different issues that will be crucial later on such as the nature of the electromagnetic modes responsible for the heat transfer .",
    "the result of eqs .",
    "( [ eq - net - q ] ) and ( [ eq - trans - man ] ) reduces to the well - known result for isotropic media first derived by polder and van hove @xcite . in that case , the reflections matrices of eq .",

    "thus , the total transmission can be written as @xmath39 , where the contributions of @xmath6- and @xmath7-polarized waves are given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 . throughout this work we focus on the analysis of the radiative linear heat conductance per unit of area , @xmath42 , which is referred to as the heat transfer coefficient .",
    "this coefficient is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the absolute temperature that we assume equal to 300 k throughout this work .",
    "additionally , we define the spectral heat flux as the heat transfer coefficient per unit of frequency . in the following sections , we apply the general results presented here to different materials and magnetic field configurations .",
    "the first obvious question to be answered is : in which materials can a magnetic field modify the nfrht ? since the thermal radiation of an object is primarily determined by its dielectric function",
    ", we need materials in which this function can be modified by an external magnetic field , that is we need magneto - optical ( mo ) materials . focusing on room temperature experiments ,",
    "the mo activity must be exhibited in the mid - infrared .",
    "thus , doped semiconductors , where the mo activity is due to conduction electrons , are ideal candidates @xcite . in these materials",
    ", one can play with the doping level to tune the plasma frequency to values comparable to the cyclotron frequency at experimentally achievable magnetic fields , which is an important requirement to have sizable magnetic - induced effects in the nfrht ( see discussion below ) .",
    "moreover , in semiconductors the nfrht in the absence of field is typically dominated by surface electromagnetic waves ( both sphps and spps ) , which in turn are known to be strongly influenced by an external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "thus , it seems natural to expect a magnetic - field modulation of nfrht in semiconductors .",
    "there is a variety of semiconductors that we could choose to illustrate our predictions . in this section",
    "we focus on insb for several reasons .",
    "first , it is a polar semiconductor where the nfrht in the absence of field is dominated by two different types of surface waves ( sphps and spps ) , which allows us to study a very rich phenomenology .",
    "second , insb has a small effective mass , which enables to tune the cyclotron frequency to values comparable to those of the plasma frequency with moderate fields .",
    "finally , insb has been the most widely studied material in the context of magnetoplasmons and coupled magnetoplasmons - surface phonon polaritons .",
    "thus , the magnetic field effect in the surface waves has been very well characterized experimentally @xcite .",
    "let us first discuss the radiative heat transfer between two identical plates made of @xmath0-doped insb when the magnetic field is perpendicular to the plate surfaces , _",

    "finally , the magnetic field enters in these expressions via the cyclotron frequency @xmath56 .",
    "the important features of the previous expressions are : ( i ) the magnetic field induces an optical anisotropy ( via the modification of the diagonal elements and the introduction of off - diagonal ones ) , ( ii ) there are two major contributions to the diagonal components of the dielectric tensor : optical phonons and free carriers , and ( iii ) the mo activity is introduced via the free carriers , which illustrates the need to deal with doped semiconductors . in what follows we shall concentrate in a particular case taken from ref .",

    "( [ eq - net - q ] ) only depends on the magnitude of the parallel wave vector , which considerably simplifies the calculation of the radiative heat transfer .",
    "let us now briefly review the expectations for the heat transfer in the absence of magnetic field .",
    "as we show in fig .",
    "[ scheme](b ) , the heat transfer coefficient features a large near - field enhancement for gaps below 1 @xmath1 m . for @xmath67",
    "nm this enhancement is largely dominated by @xmath7-polarized evanescent waves and the heat transfer coefficient increases as @xmath68 as the gap decreases , which are two clear signatures of a situation where the heat transfer is dominated by surface electromagnetic waves .",
    "this can be further confirmed with the analysis of the spectral heat flux , see fig .",
    "[ scheme](c ) , which in the near - field regime is dominated by two narrow peaks that can be associated to spps ( low - frequency peak ) and sphps ( high - frequency peak ) , as it will become evident below .",
    "thus , the case of insb constitutes an interesting example where two types of surface waves contribute significantly to the nfrht .",
    "let us now see how these results are modified in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "-doped insb as a function of the gap for different values of the magnetic field perpendicular to the plate surfaces .",
    "the inset shows the ratio between the zero - field coefficient and the coefficient for different values of the field in the near - field region .",
    "( b ) the corresponding spectral heat flux as a function of the frequency ( and wavelength ) for a gap of @xmath69 nm and different values of the perpendicular field .",
    "the solid lines correspond to the exact calculation and the circles to the uniaxial approximation where the off - diagonal terms of the permittivity tensor are assumed to be zero . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig - hz](a ) we show the heat transfer coefficient as a function of the gap size for different values of the perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "there are three salient features : ( i ) the far - field heat transfer is fairly independent of the magnetic field , ( ii ) in the near - field regime ( below 300 nm ) the magnetic field suppresses the heat transfer by up to a factor of 3 ( see inset ) , and ( iii ) by increasing the field , the heat transfer coefficient tends to saturate at around 6 t , although it is slightly reduced upon further increasing the field above 10 t ( not shown here ) .",
    "the strong modification of heat transfer due to the magnetic field is even more apparent in the spectral heat flux .",
    "as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig - hz](b ) , the magnetic field not only distorts and reduces the height of the peaks related to the surface waves , but it also generates a new peak that shifts to higher frequencies as the field increases .",
    "this additional peak appears at the cyclotron frequency and its presence illustrates the high tunability that can be achieved .",
    "notice , for instance , that for a field of 6 t the thermal emission at the cyclotron frequency is increased by almost 3 orders of magnitude with respect to the zero - field case .    to shed more light on these results",
    "it is convenient to examine the transmission of the @xmath7-polarized waves , which can be shown to dominate the heat transfer for any field .",
    "we present in fig .",
    "[ fig - trans - hz ] this transmission as a function of the magnitude of the parallel wave vector , @xmath22 , and the frequency for a gap @xmath69 nm and different values of the magnetic field .",
    "as one can see , at low fields the transmission maxima are located around a restricted area of @xmath22 and @xmath16 , clearly indicating that surface waves dominate the nfrht .",
    "notice also that their dispersion relation is modified by the field , see fig .",
    "[ fig - trans - hz](b ) . by increasing the field ,",
    "those areas are progressively replaced by areas where the maximum transmission is reached for a broad range of @xmath22-values and finally , the surface waves are restricted to the reststrahlen band @xmath70 for the highest fields , see fig .",
    "[ fig - trans - hz](d ) .",
    "what is the nature of these magnetic - field - induced modes ?        to answer this question and explain all the results just described , it is important to realize that the off - diagonal elements of the permittivity tensor do not play a major role in this configuration",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - hz](b ) where we show that the approximation consisting in setting @xmath71 in eq .  ( [ perm - tensor - hz ] )",
    "reproduces very accurately the exact results for the spectral heat flux for arbitrary magnetic fields .",
    "this means that the polarization conversion is irrelevant and the plates effectively behave as uniaxial media where their permittivity tensors are diagonal : @xmath72 _ _ diag__@xmath73 $ ] , where @xmath74 and @xmath75 . within this approximation ,",
    "which hereafter we refer to as uniaxial approximation , it is easy to compute the dispersion relation of the surface electromagnetic modes in our geometry ( see appendix d ) . in the electrostatic limit @xmath76 ,",
    "the dispersion relation of these cavity modes is given by @xmath77 with the additional constraint that both @xmath78 and @xmath79 must be negative .",
    "in the zero - field limit , this expression reduces to the known result for cavity surface modes in isotropic materials @xcite . as we show in fig .",
    "[ fig - trans - hz ] , see white solid lines , the dispersion relation of eq .",
    "( [ dr - hz ] ) nicely reproduces the structure of the transmission maxima in those frequency regions in which surfaces waves are allowed ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "it is worth stressing that this dispersion relation describes in a unified manner both the spps that appear below the reststrahlen band and the sphps due to the optical phonons .",
    "more importantly , this dispersion relation tells us that the magnetic field reduces the parallel wave vector of the surface waves and restricts the frequency region where they exist . indeed , at high fields",
    "the spps disappear , while the sphps are restricted to the reststrahlen band , fig .",
    "[ fig - trans - hz](d ) .",
    "these two effects are actually the cause of the reduction of the nfrht in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "but what about the other modes that appear by increasing the field ?",
    "their nature can also be understood within the uniaxial approximation . as we show in appendix c ,",
    "the allowed values for the transverse component of the wave vector inside these uniaxial materials are given by @xmath81 for ordinary waves and @xmath82 for extraordinary waves .",
    "the dispersion of the extraordinary waves can be rewritten as @xmath83 a dispersion that becomes hyperbolic when @xmath78 and @xmath79 have opposite signs @xcite .",
    "this is exactly what happens in our case in certain frequency regions at finite field .",
    "this illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - trans - hz](b - d ) , where we have indicated the hyperbolic regions defined by the condition @xmath84 . notice that those regions correspond exactly to the areas where the transmission reaches its maximum for a broad range of @xmath22-values .",
    "this fact shows unambiguously that our insb plates effectively behave as hyperbolic materials .",
    "more importantly , and as it is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig - trans - hz ] , we can easily modify the hyperbolic regions by changing the field .",
    "thus , we can change from situations where the hyperbolic modes ( hms ) coexist with both types of surface waves to situations where the hms dominate the nfrht , which is what occurs at high fields , see fig .",
    "[ fig - trans - hz](d ) .",
    "moreover , contrary to what happens in most hybrid hyperbolic metamaterials , we can have in a single material hms of type i ( hmi ) , where @xmath85 and @xmath86 , and hms of type ii ( hmii ) , where @xmath87 and @xmath88 , see fig .",
    "[ fig - trans - hz](b - d ) .",
    "let us recall that what makes hms so special in the context of nfrht is the fact that , as it is evident from their dispersion relation , they are evanescent in the vacuum gap and propagating inside the hyperbolic material for @xmath89 ( hmi ) or @xmath90 ( hmii ) . thus , they are a special kind of frustrated internal reflection modes that exhibit a very high transmission over a broad range of @xmath22-values that correspond to evanescent waves in the vacuum gap @xcite . as shown in ref .",
    "[ ] , the number of hms that contributes to the nfrht is solely determined by the intrinsic cutoff in the transmission , which has the form @xmath91 for @xmath76 . from this condition",
    "it follows that the heat flux due to hms scales as @xmath68 for small gaps , as the contribution of surface waves .",
    "this explains why the appearance of hms as the field increases does not modify the parametric dependence of the nfrht with the gap size .",
    "notice , however , that in spite of the high transmission of these hms , their appearance does not enhance the nfrht because they replace surface waves that possess even larger @xmath22-values ( notice that the conditions of hms and surface waves are mutually excluding ) . thus , we can conclude that the nfrht reduction induced by the magnetic field is due to both the modification of the surface waves and their replacement by hms that , in spite of their propagating nature inside the material , turn out to be less efficient transferring the radiative heat in the near - field region than the surface waves .",
    "let us point out that within the uniaxial approximation , the heat transfer can be obtained in a semi - analytical form . in this case",
    ", the transmission coefficient is given by the isotropic result of eq .",
    "( [ eq - trans - iso ] ) , where the reflections coefficients adopt now the form @xmath92 the uniaxial approximation is also useful to understand the high field behavior of the nfrht .",
    "the tendency to saturate the thermal radiation as the field increases is due to the to the fact that the cyclotron frequency becomes larger than the plasma frequency and the last term in the expression of @xmath93 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq - epsilons ] ) , progressively becomes more irrelevant .",
    "thus , the permittivity tensor becomes field - independent and the heat transfer is simply given by the result for uniaxial media , where @xmath94 has the form in eq .",
    "( [ eq - epsilons ] ) , but @xmath93 does not contain the last term in the first expression of eq .",
    "( [ eq - epsilons ] ) .",
    "we find that the strict saturation of the nfrht occurs at around 20 t and there is an intermediate regime , between 6 and 20 t , in which the near - field thermal radiation slightly increases upon increasing the field ( not shown here ) , leading to a nonmonotonic behavior .",
    "this behavior is due to an increase in the efficiency of the hms that dominate the nfrht in this high - field regime .",
    "m. the dotted line corresponds to the result for plates made of a dielectric with a frequency - independent dielectric constant equal to @xmath49 .",
    "the inset shows the corresponding ratio between the zero - field heat transfer coefficient and the coefficient for different values of the field . ]    to conclude this subsection , let us explain why the far - field heat transfer is rather insensitive to the magnetic field . for gaps much larger than the thermal wavelength ( @xmath95 m ) ,",
    "the heat transfer is dominated by propagating waves and , as we show in fig .",
    "[ fig - far - field ] , the spectral heat flux in the absence of field exhibits a broad spectrum with a peak at around @xmath96 rad / s .",
    "indeed , the spectrum is very similar to that of a dielectric with a frequency - independent dielectric constant @xmath97 , see dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig - far - field ] .",
    "as we illustrate in that figure , the presence of a magnetic field only modifies this spectrum in a significant way in a small region around the cyclotron frequency .",
    "this fact leads to a tiny modification of the heat transfer upon the application of an external field . as it can be seen in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig - far - field ] , the magnetic field reduces the far - field heat transfer coefficient as the magnetic field increases , but this reduction is quite modest and , for instance , it amounts to only 2.5% at a very high field of 20 t.      let us now turn to the case in which the magnetic field is parallel to the plate surfaces . for concreteness , we consider that the field is applied along the @xmath9-axis , @xmath98 , but obviously the result is independent of the field direction as long as it points along the surface plane , as we have explicitly checked . in this case , the permittivity tensor of insb adopts the form @xmath99 where the @xmath100 s are given by eq .",
    "( [ eq - epsilons ] ) .",
    "let us emphasize that in this case the transmission coefficient appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq - net - q ] ) depends both on the magnitude of the parallel wave and on its direction , which makes the calculations more demanding .",
    "let us also say that we consider here the same parameter values for the @xmath0-doped insb as in the example analyzed above .",

    "[ fig - trans - hx](a - c ) we identify the frequency regions where the hms exist with the condition @xmath84 , regions that progressively dominate the transmission as the field increases .",
    "thus , we see that for @xmath112 the situation is very similar to that extensively discussed in the case in which the field is perpendicular to the materials surfaces .    on the contrary ,",
    "the situation is very different for @xmath104 . in this case",

    "[ fig - trans - hx](d - f ) , this dispersion relation explains the complex structure of the transmission maxima in this case . we emphasize that this dispersion relation is reciprocal in our symmetric geometry and for this reason we only show results for @xmath119 . notice that this dispersion is very sensitive to the magnetic field and already fields of the order of 1 t strongly affect the surface waves .",
    "notice also the appearance of gaps in the dispersion relations , a subject that has been extensively discussed in the case of a single interface @xcite .",
    "overall , the field rapidly reduces the @xmath22-values of the surface waves and restricts the regions where they can exist .",
    "this strong sensitivity of the surface waves with @xmath104 is the reason for the more pronounced reduction of the nfrht for this field configuration .    in general",
    ", for an arbitrary direction @xmath17 the situation is somehow a combination of the two types of behaviors just described .",
    "the complex interplay of these behaviors for different @xmath19-directions is responsible for the nonmonotonic dependence with magnetic field , along with the change in efficiency of the hms upon varying the field . on the other hand , at very high fields",
    "the cyclotron frequency becomes much larger than the plasma frequency and the off - diagonal elements of the permittivity tensor become negligible . at the same time",
    ", the field - dependent terms in the diagonal elements also become very small .",
    "thus , the systems effectively become uniaxial and field - independent and the heat transfer is identical to the case in which the field is perpendicular . finally , in the far - field regime , the heat transfer is not sensitive to the magnetic field for the same reason as in the perpendicular configuration .",
    "let us conclude this section with two brief comments .",
    "first , as it is obvious from the discussions above , another way to modulate the nfrht is by rotating the magnetic field , while keeping fixed its magnitude .",
    "actually , we find that for any field magnitude , the nfrht is always smaller in the parallel configuration .",
    "thus , one can increase or decrease the near - field thermal radiation by rotating appropriately the magnetic field .",
    "second , we have focused here in the case of doped insb , but similar results can in principle be obtained for other doped polar semiconductors such as gaas , inas , inp , pbte , sic , etc .",
    "in the previous section we have seen that when the field is parallel to the surfaces , one can have hyperbolic emitters , but the hms always coexist to some degree with surface waves ( even at the highest field ) .",
    "we show in this section that in the case of non - polar semiconductors , where phonons do not play any role , it is possible to tune the system with a magnetic field to a situation where only hms contribute to the nfrht . for this purpose ,",
    "we choose si as the material for the two plates .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , it has been predicted @xcite , and experimentally tested @xcite , that in doped si the nfrht in the absence of field can be dominated by spps even at room temperature .",

    "we have chosen this doping level to have a situation in which the plasma frequency is not too high so that we can affect the nfrht with a magnetic field , and not too low so that the nfrht in the absence of field is still dominated by spps .",
    "the results for the heat transfer coefficient and spectral heat flux for a perpendicular magnetic field are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig - hz - si ] .",
    "although there are several features that are similar to those of the insb case , there are also some notable differences . to begin with , notice that now higher fields are needed to see a significant reduction of the nfrht ( the required fields are around an order of magnitude higher than for insb ) and the reduction factors are clearly more modest , see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig - hz - si](a ) .",
    "this is mainly a consequence of the smaller cyclotron frequency in the si case for a given field due to its larger effective mass .",
    "another consequence of the small cyclotron frequency is the fact that there is no sign of saturation of the nfrht for reasonable magnetic fields . on the other hand ,",
    "the spectral heat flux at low fields is dominated this time by a single broad peak that originates from spps ( see discussion below ) . as the field increases ,",
    "the peak height is reduced and the peak itself is broadened and deformed . as we show in what follows , this behavior is due to the appearance of hms that at high fields completely replace the surface waves .",
    "again , we can gain a further insight into these results by analyzing the transmission of the @xmath7-polarized waves for different fields , which is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - trans - hz - si ] .",
    "as one can see , the transmission is dominated by evanescent waves ( in the vacuum gap ) in a frequency region right below the plasma frequency .",
    "the origin of the structure of the transmission maxima can be understood with the uniaxial approximation discussed above in the context of insb .",
    "again , this approximation reproduces very accurately all the results for arbitrary perpendicular fields ( not shown here ) . within this approximation",
    ", one can see that at low fields the transmission is dominated by spps , as we illustrate in fig .",
    "[ fig - trans - hz - si](a - b ) in which we have introduced the dispersion relation of the spps given by eq .",
    "( [ dr - hz ] ) .",
    "as soon as the magnetic magnetic field becomes finite , the system starts to develop hms of type i in a tiny frequency region right above the region of existence of the spps , see fig .",
    "[ fig - trans - hz - si](b ) .",
    "the origin of these hms is identical to that of the insb case , but the main difference in this case is that upon increasing the field , one reaches a critical field value ( of 4.36 t for this example ) for which the surface waves cease to exist and the transmission is completely dominated by hms turning the si plates into  pure \" hyperbolic thermal emitters , see fig .  [ fig - trans - hz - si](c - d ) .    for completeness",
    ", we have also studied the heat transfer in the parallel configuration and the results for the heat transfer coefficient and spectral heat flux are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - hx - si ] . in this case",
    "the results are rather similar to those of the perpendicular configuration .",
    "in particular , contrary to the insb case we do not find a nonmonotonic behavior .",
    "moreover , the nfrht reduction is not much more pronounced than in the perpendicular case , although one can reach reduction factors of 50% for 12 t. finally , saturation is not reached for these high fields for the same reason as in the perpendicular configuration . as in the case of insb , all these results can be understood in terms of the modes that govern the near - field thermal radiation . in this sense , for a direction where @xmath105 , the spps that dominate the nfrht at low fields are progressively replaced by hmis upon increasing the field and above 4.36 t they  eat out \" all surface waves . on the contrary , for @xmath104",
    "there are no hms and the only magnetic field effect is the modification of the spp dispersion relation . again , the interplay between these two characteristic behaviors among the different @xmath19-directions explains the evolution of the nfrht with the field .    let us conclude this section by saying that the behavior reported here for si could also be observed for other non - polar semiconductors such as ge .",
    "the results reported in this work raise numerous interesting questions .",
    "thus for instance , in all cases analyzed so far , we have found that the magnetic field reduces the nfrht as compared to the zero - field result .",
    "is there any fundamental argument that forbids a magnetic - field - induced enhancement ? in principle , there is no such an argument .",
    "the reduction that we have found in doped semiconductors is due to the fact that the we have explored cases where surface waves , which are extremely efficient , dominate the nfrht in the absence of field . in this sense , one may wonder if a field - induced enhancement could take place in a situation where the nfrht in the absence of field is dominated by standard frustrated internal reflection modes , as it happens in metals @xcite .",
    "obviously , metals are out of the question due to their huge plasma frequency , but one can investigate non - polar semiconductors with a low doping level .",
    "indeed , we have done it for the case of si and again , we find that the magnetic field reduces the nfrht and moreover , exceedingly high fields are required to see any significant effect .",
    "of course , we have by no means exhausted all possibilities and , for instance , we have not explored asymmetric situations with different materials .",
    "thus , the question remains of whether the application of a magnetic field can under certain circumstances enhance the near - field thermal radiation .",
    "the discovery in this work of the induction of hyperbolic modes upon the application of a magnetic field may also have important consequences for layered structures involving thin films .",
    "recently , it has been demonstrated that thin films made of polar dielectrics may support nfrht enhancements comparable to those of bulk samples due to the excitation of sphps @xcite . since hyperbolic modes have a propagating character inside the material",
    ", they may be severely affected in a thin film geometry by the presence of a substrate .",
    "thus , one could expect much more dramatic magnetic - field effects in systems coated with semiconductor thin films .",
    "obviously , the question remains of whether one can modulate the nfrht with a magnetic field in other classes of materials .",
    "for instance , since a magneto - optical activity is required , what about ferromagnetic materials ?",
    "ideally , one could imagine to tune the nfrht by playing around with the relative orientation of the magnetization , following the spin - valve experiments in the context of spintronics .",
    "another question of general interest for the field of metamaterials is if a doped semiconductor under a magnetic field could exhibit the plethora of exotic optical properties reported in hybrid hyperbolic metamaterials @xcite .",
    "we have shown here that it can behave as a hyperbolic thermal emitter , but can it also exhibit negative refraction or be used do to subwavelength imaging and focusing in the infrared ?",
    "these are very important questions that we are currently pursuing .",
    "so in summary , we have presented in this work a very detailed theoretical analysis of the influence of a magnetic field in the nfrht . by considering the simple case of two parallel plates",
    ", we have demonstrated that for doped semiconductors the near - field thermal radiation can be strongly modified by the application of an external magnetic field . in particular , we have shown that the magnetic field may significantly reduce the nfrht and the reduction in polar semiconductors can be as large as 700% at room temperature . moreover , we have shown that when the field is perpendicular to the parallel plates , doped semiconductors become ideal hyperbolic thermal emitters with highly tunable properties .",
    "this provides a unique opportunity to explore the physics of thermal radiation in this class of metamaterials without the need to resort to complex hybrid structures .",
    "finally , all the predictions of this work are amenable to measurements with the present experimental techniques , and we are convinced that the multiple open questions that this work raises will motivate many new theoretical and experimental studies of this subject .",
