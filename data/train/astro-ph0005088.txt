    "the existence of large scale structure at high redshift ( @xmath14 ) provides an important constraint on theories for the formation of structure and evolution of the universe .",

    "such systems are believed to trace galaxies through their extended gaseous halos",
    ".    statistical analysis of the redshift distribution of available samples of quasar absorption systems suggest that large scale clustering on comoving scales up to @xmath0100 mpc may have been in place already at @xmath15@xmath023 ( e.g.   quashnock et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the complementary technique of probing for large scale structure in the plane of the sky by searching for correlated absorption in adjacent lines of sight is hampered by the relatively low density of high redshift quasars bright enough for detailed absorption line work .",
    "nonetheless , several potential high redshift absorption superclusters spanning tens of mpc on the sky have been identified in this manner .",
    "these include the @xmath16 absorption systems seen toward pks  0273@xmath2233 ( foltz et al .",

    "one of the most promising fields identified by romani et al .",

    "the four quasar candidates with lower preliminary redshifts @xmath4 are all confirmed as such .        as is evident from fig .  1 , our low resolution spectra of two of the three confirmed @xmath5 quasars ( q0120@xmath23781 and q0117@xmath2380 ) reveal no obvious civ  absorption features in the wavelength range 4350 - 4600  that",

    "the two @xmath7 systems seen in q0125@xmath2376 could conceivably be associated with the absorption seen toward q0122@xmath2380 , falling squarely between the @xmath55 complex and the weaker @xmath56 system detected in that object by carswell et al .",
