    "we examine the abundances of several molecular species in the bok globule barnard 68 ( b68 ; barnard 1919 ) , located at 125  pc in ophiuchus ( de geus , de zeeuw , & lub 1989 ) with no evidence for internal star formation .",
    "figure 1 shows an @xmath5-band image of b68 obtained from the aladin sky atlas , revealing its compact morphology . using the extinction of the background galactic bulge population , alves , lada , & lada ( 2001 ; all01 ) found a radial column density profile for b68 that was well matched with that of an isothermal bonnor - ebert sphere , specifically one with a near - critical center - to - edge density contrast of 16.5 ( bonnor 1956 ; ebert 1955 ) .",
    "this robust density determination removes a major uncertainty towards determining the molecular abundances in b68 .",
    "recently , bergin et al . (",
    "2002 ) used single - dish maps of b68 in conjunction with models incorporating the all01 bonnor - ebert density structure to ascertain radial variations in c@xmath0o and n@xmath2h@xmath3 abundance , with the lowest values occurring toward the highest extinctions .",
    "we explore further abundances of these and other species in b68 , also incorporating the all01 density structure into models .",
    "table 1 summarizes the data used to determine molecular abundances in b68 , listing the lines used , the source observatory , the angular resolution , and the angular offset of the observation from the extinction peak .",
    "figure 1 shows the position observed using the bima millimeter interferometer , approximately 4  north of the extinction peak .",
    "figure 1 also shows the minimum and maximum fwhm sizes of the bima primary beams at the frequencies of @xmath4co 10 and hco@xmath3 10 .",
    "line emission was not detected with the bima array at any observed frequency or position toward b68 .",
    "table 1 also lists studies where detections of lines were made toward b68 from single - dish observations having angular resolutions @xmath660 .",
    "figure 1 shows the resolutions of these data and the positions where line characteristics were reported .",
    "note that these positions , typically the locations of peak line intensity , vary widely across b68 .",
    "abundances were estimated using the 1d monte carlo code of hogerheijde & van der tak ( 2000 ) to calculate radiative transfer , molecular excitation , and line emission through a model of b68 , and varying abundances until the output matched the observed data .",
    "our b68 model had the thermal and density structures from all01 , i.e. , an isothermal sphere of t = 16 k with an outer radius of 12 500 au and a  bonnor - ebert parameter \" @xmath7 of 6.9 ( i.e. , center - to - edge density ratio of 16.5 ) .",
    "the central density is @xmath82.5 @xmath9 10@xmath10 @xmath11 .",
    "constant radial abundances were assumed .",
    "although abundance gradients within b68 are quite possible ( see bergin et al . ) , they should not produce large differences in the derived abundances , given the small sizes of the beam widths relative to the spatial extent of b68 .",
    "the velocity field of the gas was assumed to have a turbulent line width of 0.4 km s@xmath12 ( see wang et al . ) with no bulk motions .    to compare models with interferometer data ,  visibility \"",
    "datasets were produced from the model cubes using the baselines from the original data .",
    "these datasets were inverted , cleaned and restored in the same manner as the actual data , and velocity - integrated line intensities calculated . by properly accounting for spatial filtering , we estimated bima would have recovered only @xmath820% of the flux emitted from an all01 bonnor - ebert sphere in b68 . to compare models with single - dish data ,",
    "the model cubes were convolved with gaussians of widths appropriately representing the resolutions of the respective observations .          for their abundance estimates for b68 , bergin et al .",
    "assumed a zucconi et al . temperature profile .",
    "they found the c@xmath0o abundance in b68 rises from very low values at @xmath17  @xmath18  1 to a peak of 1  @xmath9  10@xmath19 at @xmath17  =  2 , and decreases to 1  @xmath9  10@xmath20 at @xmath17  @xmath21  20 , a contrast of @xmath8100 . also , they found the n@xmath2h@xmath3 abundance rises from very low values at @xmath17  @xmath18  1 to a peak of 6  @xmath9  10@xmath22 at @xmath17  =  3 , and decreases to 3  @xmath9  10@xmath22 at @xmath17 @xmath21  20 , a contrast of @xmath82 .",
    "any evidence of n@xmath2h@xmath3 depletion is remarkable , given its oft - described utility as a non - depleting probe of dense core interiors ( e.g. , see tafalla et al .",
    "2002 . )",
    "adopting the same temperature profile in our models , derived abundances are increased by factors of 2 - 3 from those listed in table 2 .",
    "our interferometer data of c@xmath0o and n@xmath2h@xmath3 do not provide much additional support for the abundance models of bergin et al .",
    ", except that the non - detection of compact line emission with bima suggests the low abundances found by bergin et al . are not due to the beam dilution of small clumps of relatively abundant material .",
    "our derived upper limits for c@xmath0o and n@xmath2h@xmath3 from the bima data are not particularly low , but they remain consistent with the still - lower values found by bergin et al . throughout the core .",
    "the single - dish c@xmath0o and n@xmath2h@xmath3 data from the literature only pertain to one line - of - sight per transition toward b68 , but provide strong support for the abundances derived by bergin et al .",
    ", again assuming the same zucconi et al . temperature profile .",
    "the c@xmath0o literature data , from a position 594 offset from the extinction peak , yield an apparent abundance of 69 @xmath9 10@xmath23 , quite consistent with their 39 @xmath9 10@xmath23 abundances at this position . also , the n@xmath2h@xmath3 literature data , from a position 163 offset from the extinction peak , yield an apparent value of 46 @xmath9 10@xmath22 , slightly larger than but still consistent with their 34 @xmath9 10@xmath22 abundance at this position .",
