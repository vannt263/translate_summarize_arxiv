    "there are a number of astrophysical situations where one needs to measure either the position or the flux of a faint unresolved object which is located close to a bright star .",
    "obvious examples are the search for extra - solar planets and low - luminosity companions to bright stars , and the study of close binary systems . if the flux ratio between the primary and secondary object is very large , coronographic techniques may be employed , but this is can only be effective if the separation of the images of the primary and secondary objects is substantially larger than the radius of the point - spread function ( psf ) . for small separations alternate techniques are needed .    when the separation between the binary components is comparable to , or smaller than , the radius of the psf , the image of the system will be elongated to some degree .",
    "this paper describes a technique which uses the image elongation to obtain information about the photometric and astrometric parameters of the system .",
    "there are a several conditions that are desirable in any technique which aims to measure image elongation .",
    "some important ones are :    1 .   invariance to the location of the psf 2 .",
    "invariance to the orientation of the detector 3 .",
    "insensitivity to the shape of the psf 4 .",
    "optimization of the signal - to - noise ratio 5 .",
    "ability to co - add images to improve the signal - to - noise ratio    the method described in this paper satisfies , to a large degree , all of these conditions .",
    "we begin by reviewing some elementary properties of the moments of the light distribution . for a cartesian coordinate system @xmath0 and intensity distribution @xmath1 , the zeroth , first and second moments are defined by @xmath2 where @xmath3 and the function @xmath1 is presumed to be vanishingly small at large values of @xmath4 .",
    "the integrals extend over a sufficiently large range that contributions from the end points are negligible .",
    "a shift in the position of the image , @xmath5 , induces the following changes , which are easily obtained by the substitution @xmath6 , @xmath7 from which it follows that the inertia tensor @xmath8/\\rho\\ ] ] is invariant under translations of the image .    under rotations of the coordinate system , @xmath9",
    "( a summation over repeated indices is implied ) , it is evident from the definition that @xmath10 and @xmath11 transform as a scalar and vector respectively , and that both @xmath12 and @xmath13 transform as second - rank tensors , eg .",
    "@xmath14 where there is no ambiguity , we may omit the indices on vectors , tensors and matrices and use bold face type to distinguish them from scalars quantities .",
    "let @xmath15 be proportional to the psf .",
    "we chose the proportionality constant and the origin of the @xmath16 coordinate system in such a way that the zeroth moment is unity and the first moments vanish , ie @xmath17 where the symbol `  @xmath18  ' indicates that these are normalized moments of the psf .",
    "the second moments are generally nonzero and contain information about the size and shape of the psf .",
    "now consider an image of the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "this corresponds to a binary system where the secondary has a flux @xmath21 , relative to the primary , and a vector separation @xmath22 . using eqns . 1 - 3 and 7",
    ", we obtain the inertia tensor of this image @xmath23 from this we see that the presence of the secondary component adds a term to the inertia tensor of the psf which , to first order , is proportional to the relative flux times the square of the separation . by subtracting the components of the inertia tensor of the psf from that of the binary system",
    ", we obtain this term , which we denote by @xmath24 , @xmath25 from this , if the separation vector @xmath22 is known , we obtain the relative flux .",
    "in fact , only the magnitude @xmath26 of the separation vector is needed - by taking the trace of the matrix @xmath24 we obtain @xmath27 from which @xmath21 may be determined .    alternatively ,",
    "if the relative flux is known , the diagonal terms of @xmath24 give the components of separation vector .",
    "even if @xmath21 is not known , the position angle @xmath28 of the separation vector , with respect to the @xmath29 axis , can be found from the ratio of diagonal terms , @xmath30      in practice we work with a digital image which consists of a discrete set of samples @xmath31 corresponding to pixels located at positions @xmath32 , normally on a square grid at intervals @xmath33 .",
    "the values @xmath31 are proportional to the product of the intensity and the pixel response functions @xmath34 integrated over the pixel areas . if the response function is the same for all pixels we have @xmath35 thus the values @xmath31 actually sample the image formed by smoothing the incident intensity with the pixel response function .",
    "this effect can be incorporated by employing the actual psf of the sampled image , which includes the result of the smoothing .    from the sampling theorem ( see , for example , @xcite ) the function @xmath1 can be uniquely reconstructed from the samples @xmath31 only if it contains no spatial frequencies higher than the nyquist frequency @xmath36 . for a diffraction",
    "limited image , at wavelength @xmath37 , from a telescope of aperture diameter @xmath38 , the pixel spacing must be no greater than @xmath39 . the image is then given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "substitution of this equation into eqns .",
    "1 - 3 gives the corresponding discrete expressions @xmath42 providing that the integrals converge .",
    "7 , 13 - 15 and 19 - 21 then provide a direct path from the observational data to the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 of the binary system .",
    "while this simple technique seems plausible , in practice it does not work due to problems of convergence and noise , discussed next .",
    "however a modification of the technique , developed in section 2.5 avoids these difficulties while at the same time optimizing the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the above algorithm fails because for real astronomical images the integrals in eqns . 1 - 3",
    "do not converge .",
    "this is a result of the psf of an optical system being a band - limited function .",
    "the amplitude of the light in the psf is the two - dimensional spatial fourier transform of the optical transfer function ( otf ) .",
    "there is an upper limit to the spatial frequency at which the otf can be non - zero , imposed by the finite size of the telescope entrance pupil .",
    "the otf is the product of the instrumental and atmospheric transfer functions with the pupil function , defined as unity for points within the pupil and zero for points outside . from the convolution theorem ,",
    "the amplitude of the psf is therefore the convolution of the instrumental and atmospheric response with the fourier transform of the pupil function .",
    "since the square of the latter function is just the diffraction - limited psf , it follows that the intensity of light in the psf can not fall off faster than the diffraction limit . for a circular aperture",
    "this has the form ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath43 ^ 2\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is measured in radians , @xmath45 is the wave number , @xmath37 the wavelength , and @xmath46 is the radius of the aperture . for large values of its argument",
    ", the bessel function has the asymptotic expansion @xmath47 so @xmath48 falls off no faster than @xmath49 . since @xmath50 , the integral in eqn .",
    "3 is ill - defined .",
    "even more serious is the fact that random noise , present in the image , causes a rapid divergence of the moments . to see this , recall that both the photon noise and the read noise is uncorrelated from pixel to pixel .",
    "the presence of such noise adds a fluctuating component to @xmath1 which in turn produces fluctuations in the moments .",
    "the variance of these fluctuations is the sum of the variances of the individual pixel fluctuations , weighted by the _ squares _ of the coordinate terms present in eqns . 2 and 3 .",
    "since the read noise is independent of position , the variance of all moments increases without limit over the range of integration .",
    "the solution that we propose for these problems is to apply weight factors to the intensity values of the image before computing the moments . in order to preserve the transformation properties of the inertia tensor",
    ", the weights can not depend on the coordinates , but can only be a function of @xmath31 .",
    "we make the substitution @xmath51 , and ask what choice of @xmath52 minimizes the random error in the moments . from eqns .",
    "19 - 21 we then have @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes the variance of the random variable @xmath55 .",
    "we seek to minimize the ratios @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and so equate to zero the derivatives of these ratios with respect to @xmath52 .",
    "this leads to the result @xmath59 two possible dependencies for the noise are @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the first case corresponds to photon ( poisson ) noise .",
    "it leads to @xmath62 which , as we have seen , is unacceptable .",
    "the second case corresponds to a constant read noise .",
    "it leads to the choice @xmath63 . as the inertia tensor is independent of the normalization of @xmath31",
    ", we may choose the proportionality constant to be unity .",
    "this choice of weights solves the convergence problems as the asymptotic dependence of @xmath64 is now proportional to @xmath65 .",
    "while the use of weights solves the convergence and noise problems , it introduces complications in the interpretation of the results .",
    "our choice of weights is equivalent to performing the previous ( unweighted ) analysis on a new image formed by squaring the intensity values of the original image .",

    "12 but has an extra term involving the factor @xmath69 .",
    "this factor depends on the shape of the psf and the separation @xmath22 . for any separation ,",
    "it can be computed numerically , using the image of the reference star to estimate the psf .",
    "the function @xmath70 approaches unity for small values of @xmath26 and zero for large @xmath26 . for a gaussian psf it has the simple analytic form @xmath71 where @xmath72 is related to the fwhm @xmath73 of the psf by @xmath74 . for close binary systems @xmath75",
    "is small and @xmath70 is quite close to unity .",
    "29 - 31 , which represent the generalization of eqn . 12 in the weighted case ,",
    "relate the binary system parameters to the difference in the inertia tensor components between the binary and comparison images .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio that can be achieved in a single image is limited by the dynamic range of the detector . however",
    ", the signal - to - noise ratio can be increased by the use of multiple exposures .",
    "a high - signal - to - noise - ratio image can be obtained by co - aligning the individual images , interpolating and summing the individual intensities .",
    "however , the complexity of this process can be avoided if one wants only to measure the image ellipticity .    the moments , eqns . 1 - 3 , are linear in @xmath76 .",
    "because of this , the sum of the moments of a number of individual images are equivalent to the moments of the summed image . moreover , because @xmath77 is independent of translations , it is not necessary or desirable to co - align the individual images .",
    "one simply computes the inertia tensor @xmath78 for each image and averages the corresponding components : @xmath79 this method is preferable to computing the inertia tensor for a coadded image because the latter technique is sensitive to errors in alignment of the individual images .",
    "the analysis of noise propagation in equations ( 7 ) , ( 19 - 21 ) , and ( 28 ) is straight forward . considerable simplification results if we make the reasonable assumption that the psf is circularly symmetric , at least to first order . for the limiting cases in which the noise variance per pixel is either constant ( read noise dominated ) or proportional to the intensity ( photon noise dominated ) we find @xmath80\\ ] ] where @xmath81 is the total signal - to - noise ratio of the image , @xmath82^{1/2}\\ ] ] and @xmath83 where @xmath84 for the read - noise - dominated case and @xmath85 for the photon - noise - dominated case .    for the case of diffraction - limited imaging by a circular aperture",
    ", the tensors may be evaluated analytically .",
    "using eqn .",
    "22 and replacing the summation by integration in eqn .",
    "36 , and recalling that we are working with the square of the intensity ( section 2.5 ) , we obtain @xmath86 ^ 4       cos^2(\\phi ) r^3dr d\\phi \\over 32\\pi\\int_0^\\infty [ j_1(krr)/krr]^4 rdr }        \\nonumber \\\\       & = & { 1\\over 2k^2r^2 } \\int_0^\\infty j_1(x)^4 x^{-1}dx /          \\int_0^\\infty j_1(x)^4 x^{-3}dx\\nonumber \\\\       & = & 0.088179 ( kr)^{-2}~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] similarly , @xmath87 which gives @xmath88 ^ 4 \\\\",

    "29 it is evident that there is no simple relation between the binary system parameters and the inertia tensor .",
    "simulations indicate that the last term in this equation typically contributes about 1/3 of the ellipticity signal .",
    "if we assume that the variance in the image of the comparison star image is comparable to that of the binary system , we expect that @xmath89 eqns .",
    "40 - 42 can be used to estimate the signal - to - noise ratio that would be required for any desired measurement of the binary system parameters .",
    "for example , if we assume that the magnitude @xmath26 of the separation vector is known , the error in the measured flux ratio becomes , for the photon - noise - limited case , @xmath90^{1/2 } \\sim { 1\\over s } \\left[{\\lambda",
    "\\over    ad}\\right]^2~.\\ ] ] thus , in order to detect and measure , to 10% accuracy , a binary which has flux ratio 0.01 and separation comparable to the size of the diffraction - limited psf , @xmath91 , we need @xmath92 which implies a total signal - to - noise ratio of order @xmath93 .      in order to verify this analysis and evaluate the performance of the method , numerical simulations were performed . in a series of monte - carlo runs ,",
    "artificial images were created of both a binary system and a reference star , by placing a suitably - scaled psf image at the location of each component and then adding random noise . for each run",
    "the program estimated the desired parameters .",
    "the mean values and standard errors of the parameters were then determined for the set of runs .    as an example , consider the dwarf carbon star system g77 - 61 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the secondary is believed to be a population - ii white dwarf , and a measure of its luminosity can provide a lower limit to the age of the universe ( @xcite ) . in the near infrared , the white dwarf is expected to be 4 to 5 magnitudes fainter than the primary star , and the maximum separation of the system is estimated to be 0.035 arcsec . for a hypothetical observation using the hubble space telescope ( hst ) and nic1 infrared camera , the pixel size is 0.043 arcsec and the aperture diameter is 2.4 m. thus , to avoid aliasing , we must use filters which block wavelengths below 1.0 um .",
    "the flux ratio is expected to be 0.009 and 0.021 at a wavelength of 1.10 um and 1.55 um respectively .",
    "we regard the separation as known and wish to measure the relative flux from the observations .",
    "the results of simulations of this system are presented in figs . 1 and 2 and table 1 .",
    "these show the estimated value of the flux ratio @xmath21 , and its statistical error , as a function of the total signal - to - noise ratio @xmath81 , for two different wavelengths . at low values of @xmath81 ,",
    "noise fluctuations dominate , producing a substantial random elongation of the image . as a result ,",
    "both @xmath21 and its error are large . as @xmath81 increases",
    ", the noise fluctuations decrease and the image becomes more circular  both @xmath21 and its error decrease . at @xmath94 , the binary nature of the star prevents further circularization of the image , and @xmath21 stabilizes at the correct flux ratio .",
    "when @xmath95 , the relative error of @xmath21 has dropped to about 0.1 . from this we can conclude that in order to measure the flux ratio with an error of 10% , a total signal - to - noise ratio of order @xmath96 is required .",
    "this is much greater than can be obtained in a single image , but could be achieved by coadding many exposures .",
    "the exposure time for the individual images should be chosen to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio , while remaining in the linear region of the detector . as this results in a constraint on the maximum flux in any individual pixel , it may be more convenient to work with the peak signal - to - noise ratio @xmath97 , ie . that of the central pixel , rather than the total signal - to - noise ratio @xmath81 . for the photon - noise - limited case",
    ", the two quantities are related by the square root of the fraction of the total light contained within the central pixel @xmath98 both total and peak signal - to - noise ratios are listed in table 1 .    the results of the simulation show that the analytic error estimate of eqn .",
    "43 is reasonably accurate . for the 1.1-um simulation",
    ", this equation predicts that a total signal - to - noise ratio @xmath99 would be required for a 10% measurement of @xmath21 which , given the approximation in estimating the variance from eqn .",
    "28 , is in quite good agreement with the value @xmath100 indicated by the simulation .",
    "we have described a new technique for the detection and measurement of unresolved binary systems based on the elongation of their images , in comparison to images of refererence stars .",
    "the method can only work if variations the shape of the psf , between the binary and reference observations , are smaller than the elongation to be measured .",
    "the analysis and simulations show what signal - to - noise ratio must be obtained in order to reduce the random errors to any desired level .",
    "however , one must also consider systematic errors that may not be removed by the differential measurement technique .",
    "these include optical aberrations , guiding errors , and any other effects of this nature .",
    "aberrations can be minimized by positioning the reference star and binary at precisely the same location on the detector .",
    "guiding errors which are the same for both reference and target observations will be removed by the analysis , but any variations will contaminate the signal .",
    "such effects should be characterized and understood before observations are attempted . for hst ,",
    "guiding errors are reported to be of order 0.001 arcsec on an individual exposure .",
    "if these are random , they can be reduced to sufficiently small levels by obtaining many exposures .    ideally , it would be best to observe the target and reference stars simultaneously , if their separation is sufficiently small that both images can simultaneously fit on the detector . in this case asymmetries due to",
    "guiding errors should be the same for both images and will be removed by the analysis . in order to minimize optical aberrations , the stars should be placed on opposite sides of the optical field center , and equidistant from it . to further reduce systematic effects , the telescope should be rotated axially by @xmath101 , if possible , to interchange the positions of target and reference stars . by exposing for equal times in the two configurations , the systematic component of the psf",
    "will then be identical for both target and reference images",
    ".    it should be possible to apply this technique to images produced by adaptive optics systems on ground - based telescopes .",
    "the high - resolution provided by such systems facilitates the detection of close binaries , but great care will be needed to minimize variations in the psf between the binary system and the comparison star . because the performance of adaptive optics systems depends the brightness of the reference star and on the atmospheric seeing , the binary system and calibration star need to be well - matched in both magnitude and sky position .",
    "we hope to test the feasibility of the method in the near future by means of adaptive - optics observations with the canada - france - hawaii telescope .",
    "i am grateful to harvey richer for bringing the problem of the measurement of g77 - 61 to my attention , and for several interesting discussions .",
    "an anonymous referee provided helpful comments and emphasized the importance of matching the comparison and target stars .",
