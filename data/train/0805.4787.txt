    "the isovector giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) is a most prominent and much studied excitation mode of nuclei , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , it remains a subject of actual interest as there are many aspects which deserve more detailed investigations as , e.g. , photo - excitation cross sections in exotic nuclei which play a role in astrophysical reaction chains @xcite or isotopic trends of the gdr including the regimes of deformed nuclei .",
    "the present paper aims at a theoretical survey of the gdr in isotopic chains of heavy and super - heavy nuclei .",
    "the high importance of the gdr has triggered since long many theoretical surveys analyzing the intriguing aspects of nuclear collective motion , starting from a purely collective description @xcite and slowly establishing a link to microscopic models in the framework of the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite .",
    "the theoretical description has much developed over the years .",
    "the majority of rpa investigations in the past employed shell model potentials plus an effective residual interaction ( migdal theory ) @xcite . in the meantime , self - consistent nuclear models have been steadily improving towards a reliable description of nuclear structure and excitations , for reviews see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "these models belong to the class of density functional methods which aim at a universal energy functional for a given system from which all static and dynamics equations are derived in a strictly variational frame @xcite .",
    "such density functional models , being rather universal by construction , are promising for investigation in exotic areas , e.g. for r - process , drip - line and super - heavy nuclei .",
    "the studies in this paper are based on the skyrme functional which has been introduced in @xcite and extended to a dynamical description shortly after @xcite .",
    "the performance of self - consistent rpa calculations using the skyrme functional had been tested systematically in @xcite and it was found that one can have a reliable description when taking care to chose an appropriate parametrization .",
    "systematic scans through the isotopic landscape and the study of exotic nuclei run over many deformed nuclei .",
    "fully fledged rpa calculations for deformed nuclei are feasible @xcite , but extremely time consuming , not suited for systematic investigations .",
    "super - heavy nuclei are especially demanding due to a coexistence of two obstacles , large size and deformation .",
    "accurate but less demanding rpa techniques are needed . to that end , the separable rpa ( srpa ) based on the skyrme functional",
    "was recently developed @xcite .",
    "the self - consistent factorization of the residual interaction in srpa reduces the computational expense dramatically and so gives way to systematic explorations of nuclear giant resonances in both spherical and deformed nuclei @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the isovector ( t=1 ) electric gdr .",
    "as was shown in our previous studies @xcite-@xcite , srpa provides an accurate description of the gdr in spherical and deformed nuclei .",
    "we obtained good agreement with experiment for @xmath0sm , @xmath1u and nd isotopes with a=142 , 144 , 146 , 148 , 150 .",
    "eight different skyrme forces were checked in these investigations . in this paper",
    ", we aim at a large systematics over the isotopic landscape and decide for one parameterization , namely sly6 @xcite which was found to provide a satisfying description of the gdr for spherical and deformed nuclei . in a first step , srpa",
    "results for the gdr will be compared with all available experiment data in rare - earth and actinide regions . in particular ,",
    "we consider nuclei @xmath2gd , @xmath3er , @xmath4yb , @xmath5hf , @xmath6w , @xmath7os , @xmath8th and @xmath9u .",
    "basic characteristics ( energy centroid , width , deformation splitting ) and their trends with system size will be analyzed .    in a second step , we will investigate the gdr in super - heavy nuclei for the three isotopic chains : nobelium with z=102 ( a=242 , 248 , 254 , 262 , 270 ) , z=114 ( a=264 , 274 , 284 , 294 , 304 ) and z=120 ( a=280 , 288 , 294 , 304 , 312 ) . as discussed below",
    ", this set covers most of the important mass regions and so is sufficiently representative .",
    "the main features of the gdr are analyzed and compared with those in rare - earth and actinide region .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the calculation scheme , methods of analysis and choice of the isotopes are sketched in sec .",
    "[ sec : calc_scheme ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] the results of the calculations for the gdr in rare - earth , actinide and super - heavy nuclei are discussed . a summary is done in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "the calculations are performed in the framework of srpa @xcite with the skyrme force sly6 @xcite which provides a satisfying description of the gdr for heavy nuclei @xcite .",
    "the contribution to the residual interaction from the time - odd current density , coulomb and pairing ( at the bcs level ) are taken into account @xcite .",
    "the calculations employ a cylindrical coordinate - space grid with the mesh size 0.7 fm .",
    "the calculation box has 24 - 35 mesh points depending on the nuclear size and deformation . for generators of the separable interaction , we use four input operators , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 , with",
    "@xmath13 chosen following the prescription @xcite .",
    "these operators are shown to give accurate results in spherical nuclei @xcite .",
    "besides , the operator @xmath14 is added to take into account the multipole mixing of excitations with the same projection @xmath15 and space parity @xmath16 .    for all nuclei , the equilibrium quadrupole deformations are found by minimization of the total energy . the deformations are characterized by the charge quadrupole moments @xmath17 and related dimensionless parameters @xmath18 as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the proton density in the ground state , @xmath21 is the r.m.s .",
    "proton radius and @xmath22 is the number of protons .",
    "the calculations use a large basis space of single - particle states to expand the srpa operators with two - quasiparticle states extending up to @xmath23 mev , see table i. the energy - weighted sum rule @xmath24 is then exhausted by 92 - 95@xmath25 .",
    "this sum rule includes the isovector effective mass @xmath26 as the velocity - dependent terms are involved to the calculations , see discussion in @xcite . in sly6",
    "we have actually @xmath27=0.80 .",
    "since srpa includes the dipole time - odd momentum - like operators @xcite , the center - of - mass mode should , in principle , be placed correctly at zero energy .",
    "however , the finite computational box breaks translational invariance such that the spurious isoscalar e1 strength becomes concentrated at the region of 2 - 3 mev . that is safely below the gdr which we are studying here .    the energy - weighted isovector dipole strength function is computed as @xmath28 smoothed by the lorentz function @xmath29 with the averaging parameter @xmath30=2 mev in most of the calculations .",
    "that averaging width was found to be optimal for the comparison with experiment and simulation of broadening effects beyond srpa ( escape widths , coupling with complex configurations ) .",
    "further , @xmath31 is the ground state , @xmath32 runs over the rpa spectrum with eigenfrequency @xmath33 and eigenstate @xmath34 .",

    "the upper panels show full srpa results ( with residual interaction ) and the lower panels pure two - quasiparticle ( 2qp ) strengths ( without residual interaction ) .",
    "the separate branches @xmath15=0 ( small ) and @xmath15=1 ( large ) are plotted by the dotted line and their sum by the full line . , width=245,height=188 ]    besides the splitting of the gdr into two branches , the deformation also results in a considerable redistribution of the strength within every branch . in other words",
    ", the deformation severely influences the landau fragmentation itself .",
    "this effect is illustrated in table ii and fig .",
    "[ fig : branches ] .",
    "table ii provides the widths of the resonance branches @xmath39 and @xmath42 for a selection of nuclei .",
    "there is a large difference between spherical and deformed nuclei . in spherical nuclei ( @xmath41114 , @xmath41120 , @xmath43120 )",
    ", we have @xmath44 , while in deformed nuclei , @xmath45 and their sum @xmath46 roughly covers the total width @xmath47 .",
    "so , we see a strong deformation effect within the branches themselves . in order to analyze it , we plot in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : branches ] the unperturbed two - quasiparticle ( 2qp ) strengths . in deformed nuclei ( @xmath40gd )",
    "the inequality @xmath45 appears already in 2qp strengths , which shows that this is simply an effect of the density of states .",
    "the residual interaction ( srpa case ) does not cause essential changes in the relation between @xmath39 and @xmath42 branches and preserves @xmath45 in deformed nuclei . besides showing the influence of deformation , fig .",
    "[ fig : branches ] also illustrates the collective shifts from the unperturbed strengths to the final ones .",
    "the size of the shifts is , of course , related to the actual force sly6 .",
    "the shifts are 4.0 and 3.4 mev in @xmath40gd and @xmath41120 , respectively .    in most of the nuclei",
    "the calculations indicate a small shoulder at the right flank of the resonance .",
    "the heavier the nucleus , the stronger the shoulder . at a small averaging width , the shoulder becomes more pronounced and may even show up as a separate peak , see e.g. results for @xmath30=0.5 mev in fig .",
    "[ fig : var_aver ] .",
    "this effect is often absent , at least much less pronounced , in the experimental data .",
    "the shoulder takes place in both deformed and spherical nuclei and so is independent of deformation .",
    "it persists not only for sly6 but also for most of other skyrme forces @xcite .",
    "as was shown in @xcite , the effect is caused by specific 2qp structures with high angular momentum ( thus large statistical weight ) lying at the right gdr flank .",
    "it is to be noted that rpa neglects some broadening mechanisms ( escape widths , coupling with complex , 2p-2h , etc , configurations ) which could soften these structures",
    ". the shoulder can be further enhanced if the skyrme force overestimates the dipole collective shift @xcite .",
    "the case calls for further detailed exploration .",
    "the isovector giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) is systematically investigated in rare - earth , actinide and super - heavy regions .",
    "the study covers 37 nuclei altogether .",
    "mainly axially deformed nuclei are considered . in all the nuclei ,",
    "the calculated quadrupole moments correctly reproduce the experimental data ( rare - earth and actinide regions ) @xcite or macroscopic - microscopic estimates ( super - heavy region ) @xcite .",
    "the calculations are performed in the framework of the self - consistent separable rpa approach ( srpa ) based on the skyrme functional .",
    "the force sly6 is used .",
    "a satisfying agreement of the srpa results with the available gdr experimental data is found for 22 rare - earth and actinide nuclei .",
    "resonance energies and widths are well described .",
    "the trends of the peak energies are compared with simple estimates from collective models .",
    "it is confirmed that the steinwedel - jensen ( sj ) model performs well for medium heavy nuclei while a mix of sj and the goldhaber - teller scenarios is more appropriate for heavy nuclei .",
    "encouraged by these results , the survey is extended to super - heavy nuclei where gdr in isotope chains with @xmath22=102 , 114 and 120 are explored .",
    "the gdr in super - heavy nuclei is found to behave similar to that in rare - earth and actinide nuclei .",
    "the peak energies are , again , better described by the mixed collective model , continuing the trend from heavy nuclei .",
    "a new feature in the super - heavy region is that the peak energies turn from decrease to increase towards the neutron rich ends of the isotopic chains ( close to the drip lines ) .",
    "we also analyze the gdr widths @xmath47 .",
    "they are shown to be strictly dominated ( at least 70 - 90@xmath25 ) by landau fragmentation and deformation contributions .",
    "the direct deformation contribution through the splitting of the gdr into @xmath39 and 1 branches achieves 40% .",
    "the landau fragmentation is severely affected by the deformation as well , which modifies the branch widths and lead to @xmath45 .",
    "the final step to agreement with experimental pattern is achieved by lorentz averaging the srpa results , thus simulating missing broadening mechanisms ( e.g. , escape widths and coupling with complex configurations ) .",
    "a modest additional broadening of @xmath48 1 mev suffices to reach realistic pattern .",
