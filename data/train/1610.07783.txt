    "radio galaxies found in clusters of galaxies often show very striking structural features not seen among those outside clusters .",
    "these include narrow angle tails ( nats ) , wide angle tails ( wats ) , and some other peculiar morphologies ( see e.g. , miley 1980 ; odea and owen 1985 ; owen and ledlow 1997 ) , which hopefully shed light on both the radio galaxy and its interaction with the cluster medium .",
    "the interaction between the radio sources in the clusters and the cluster environment is not well understood ( feretti & giovannini 2008 ) .",
    "radio galaxies in the same or similar types of clusters are often found to be very different in their radio morphologies .",
    "one possible explanation for the difference in radio structures is the difference in the relative speed of the parent galaxy with respect to the surrounding intra - cluster medium ( icm ) or differences within the icm at the location of these radio galaxies .",
    "as the radio jets propagate through icm , variations in the icm density and velocity may account for the complex radio morphologies that are observed .",
    "of course the energy budget of the radio galaxies in question must also be playing a crucial role while interacting with the icm .",
    "a difference in the radio ages of the galaxies may also influence their appearance .    in this paper , we present low - frequency , gmrt observations at 240 , 610 and 1300 mhz of ic  711 , a long head - tail radio galaxy .",
    "the galaxy lies in abell cluster 1314 ( redshift @xmath4 ) which hosts another radio galaxy ic  708 in the peculiar shape of a highly bent wat .",
    "the radio structures of the radio galaxies ic  711 and ic  708 are very dissimilar .",
    "the radio galaxy ic  711 has a narrow long tail of total angular extent @xmath1 arcmin . on the other hand ic  708",
    "has a rather squat radio morphology , with a wide - angle tail structure with a maximum extension of about 2 arcmin .",
    "these two objects have been studied with the westerbork telescope ( valle & wilson 1976 ; wilson & valle 1977 ; jgers 1987 ; valle & strom 1988 ) and the very large array ( odea and owen 1985 ; owen & ledlow 1997 ) . our objectives for gmrt observations were to investigate the diffuse - emission of the long tail structure of ic  711 at low frequencies and to explore what further constraints can be put on the prevalent ideas in literature about the formation of the head - tail morphologies .",
    "the gmrt observations were made at 240 , 610 and 1300 mhz on 2015 july .",
    "the gmrt consists of thirty 45-m antennas in an approximate ` y ' shape similar to the very large array but with each antenna in a fixed position .",
    "twelve antennas are randomly placed within a central 1 km @xmath5 1 km square ( the `` central square '' ) and the remainder form the irregularly shaped y ( 6 on each arm ) over a total extent of about 25 km .",
    "further details about the array can be found at the gmrt website at http://www.gmrt.ncra.tifr.res.in .",
    "the observations were made in the standard fashion , with each source observation interspersed with observations of the phase calibrator .",
    "the source was observed in dual ( 610/240 mhz ) frequency mode for 8 hours , although a small percentage of data had to be edited out due to ionospheric disturbances .",
    "the primary flux 3c286 whose flux density were estimated to be 52.6 and 67.1 at 240 mhz , 29.1 and 20.6 density calibrator was 3c286 whose flux density was estimated to be 67.1 jy at 240 mhz , 20.6 jy at 610 mhz , and 15.7 jy at 1300 mhz .",
    "the phase calibrator was 3c241 whose flux density was estimated to be 10.65@xmath60.62 jy at 240 mhz , 4.53@xmath60.02 jy at 610 mhz and 2.03@xmath60.04 jy at 1300 mhz .",
    "the data analyses were done using the astronomical image processing software ( aips ) of the national radio astronomy observatory .",
    "the total flux densities of different sources or tail components of ic711 were measured using the aips task tvstat , which allows us to pick an area of any shape .",
    "error on the flux density of a component was obtained by multiplying the average noise rms with @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the total area of the component measured in units of synthesized beams .",
    "the observational parameters of the gmrt beams for different frequencies are listed in table 1 .",
    "* table 1 . * the observational parameters of gmrt +    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,>,>,>,>,^,^,^ \" , ]     according to valle ( 1988 ) , the radio - tail hypothesis of miley et al .",
    "( 1972 ) can explain the shape of the head - tail galaxy ic  711 due to it ploughing through the dense intra - cluster gas as it moves in a simple circular orbit around the abell 1314 centre where ic  712 is located ( fig .",
    "1 ) . the low - resolution maps used by valle ( 1988 ) did not separate out the independent sources u3 and u4 from the diffuse tail of ic 711 ( fig . 1 ) and that made it look like somewhat circular morphology .",
    "valle s ( 1988 ) numerical simulations conform to that picture , where one of the main ingredient in their numerical simulation was the orbital motion of the galaxy around the cluster center .",
    "but now with better angular resolutions we have not only resolved the two sources u3 and u4 as not parts of the long tail of ic  711 , but also the long straight tail makes it unambiguously clear that it is not affected by any gravitational force of the center galaxy ic  712 .",
    "moreover the extreme sharpness of tail bends after ` d ' and ` e ' also makes it clear that these bends are not result of any gravitational effect of any individual galaxy or even that of the overall gravitational potential of the cluster members . nor",
    "could one think that the galaxy ic  711 could have moved in past along a path f - e - d - c ( fig .",
    "1 ) , as no gravitational influence on the galaxy could have made it take a path with such sharp bends .",
    "it looks like that the sharp bends have been caused by some sort of ` walls ' or rather dense medium near ` d ' and ` e ' points ( burns 1986 ) . the presence of radio sources u3 close to ` d ' as well as u4 at ` e ' could have been those ` walls ' . for one thing",
    "there appears to be no splatter where the jet or tail encounters ` wall ' .",
    "further , there are no optical counterparts of either of these sources to confirm them as cluster members and either or both of them could be foreground or background sources , though their presence close to the locations ` d ' as well as ` e ' are suggestive of some connection with the sharp bending .",
    "another chance coincidence seems to be that four optically unidentified , prominent radio sources u1 , u2 , u3 , u4 ( fig .",
    "1 ) seem to lie within a few degrees in a straight line over a separation of 10 arcmin .",
    "this is a chance coincidence is corroborated by the fact that while u1 has a double radio structure quite close to this straight line joining these four sources , u3 shows a double radio structure almost perpendicular to this straight line .",
    "the spectral index of the head ( a ) of ic 711 is flat ( @xmath9 ; defined as s@xmath10 ) between 240 and 1300 mhz ( table 2 ) , while the spectral index of the tail steadily steepens as we move away from the head ( table 2 ) .",
    "the closer parts of the tail ( b to c and c to d ; fig . 1 )",
    "are having still a normal spectra between 240 and 610 mhz , but the spectra of these parts of the tail is quite steep between 610 and 1300 mhz .",
    "but the remote parts of the tail ( d to e and e to f ) is rather steep between 240 and 610 mhz itself , and at frequencies higher than 610 mhz it is extremely steep ( @xmath11 )",
    ". the closer parts of the tail may have break frequency not very far from 610 mhz , but the remote parts of the tail may have a break frequency more closer or even lower than 240 mhz .",
    "but since we have the detailed flux density measurements of the different parts of the tail at only these three frequencies , we take 610 mhz as the break frequency for our calculations as we find the spectra differ at the lower and higher frequencies .",
    "the luminosity of ic 711 at 610 mhz is @xmath12 w hz@xmath13 while that of ic 708 is @xmath14 w hz@xmath13 .",
    "thus both radio galaxies fall very well within the fri luminosity range . in this case",
    "we have both a nat as well as a wat in the same cluster quite close to each other and on the same side of the cluster centre .",
    "the minimum energy density for a synchrotron radio source component having a spectral break is given by @xmath15 ^{4/7 }   { \\rm erg\\ : cm}^{-3 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( see appendix a ) . here",
    "@xmath16 is the redshift , @xmath17 ( jy ) is the flux density at the break frequency @xmath18 ( ghz ) , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the spectral indices before and after the break , with @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( ghz ) as the lower and upper cut off frequencies presumably for the observed radio spectrum , @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( arcsec ) represent the size of the source component along its major and minor radio axes , and @xmath25 is the path length through the component along the line of sight in kpc . in the case of ic  711 , with its long head - tail radio morphology ,",
    "we take it to be a bent cylinder and take its depth to be equal to its minor radio axis and thus @xmath25 is calculated from @xmath24 , the width of the tail . at a redshift of 0.034 , for @xmath26 km s@xmath13",
    "mpc@xmath13 it scales to 0.67 kpc per arcsec .",
    "we have assumed an equal energy distribution between the electrons and the heavy particles , taken the volume filling factor to be unity and also assumed the pitch angle to be @xmath27 .",
    "apart from other things these are consistent with our objective of finding at least a minimum value estimate of the energy density in the radio source component .",
    "the equipartition magnetic field @xmath28 is calculated from equation  ( [ eq:64q1 ] ) @xmath29    the estimates of the minimum energy densities and equipartition magnetic fields for different parts of the tail are given in table 2 .",
    "here we have integrated the radio emission from 100 mhz to 10 ghz .",
    "it should be noted that the upper cut - off frequency value is less critical for the minimum energy estimates .",
    "surprisingly minimum energy estimates appear a bit larger in the remote parts of the tail , i.e. , tail parts lying between d and e or between e and f ( fig .",
    "this is because the spectrum in each of these cases is already quite steep between 240 and 610 mhz and most likely the break frequency is much lower than our assumed 610 mhz .",
    "but we do not have any measurements of the flux densities of these tail parts at still lower frequencies .",
    "the rather steep spectral index values between 240 and 610 mhz results in unusually larger number of electrons at lower cut - off frequency limit and thus much larger @xmath30 estimates .",
    "on the other hand for ic  708 n and s components or even of the whole radio source the spectrum is not steep ( table 2 ) .",
    "in fact from the 5 ghz map of valle & wilson ( 1976 ) it seems the break frequency for ic  708 n and s components is @xmath31 ghz .",
    "our integrated 1300 mhz flux density measurements 791@xmath624 mjy of ic  708 are consistent with the measurements 835 @xmath680 mjy at 1.4 ghz by wilson & valle ( 1977 ) .",
    "also our 610 mhz flux density value ( 1363@xmath642 mjy ) is equally consistent with the value 1432@xmath670 mjy at 610 mhz , as measured by valle & wilson ( 1976 ) .    assuming that the spectral break lies around 610 mhz , the synchrotron life - times of radiating electrons are calculated from @xmath32 ( see appendix b ) .",
    "since we are using the equipartition magnetic field determined from equation  ( [ eq:64q ] ) , where pitch angle was assumed to be @xmath27 , to be consistent we put @xmath33 here also .",
    "synchrotron life - times turn out to be about @xmath34 yr .",
    "however , following van der laan & perola ( 1969 ) , if we include the inverse - compton losses from the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) with energy density @xmath35 or the equivalent magnetic field , @xmath36 we can write the radiative life - times as @xmath37^{-1 } \\\\",

    ". the projected distance of the tail end from the head is @xmath42700 kpc , which would take @xmath43 yr for the galaxy ic 711 moving within the cluster with a velocity @xmath44 km s@xmath13 ( coleman et al .",
    "the over all source must be in the sky plane , otherwise the ` longest tail ' will be still longer .",
    "coleman et al .",
    "( 1976 ) have estimated that ic 711 radio tail may be making an angle of @xmath45 with respect to the sky plane and then its physical length will be about @xmath46 longer than that the projected length observed in the sky plane .",
    "now the radiative life - times of @xmath47 yr are inconsistent with the presumed absence of any re - acceleration occurrence in the tail parts as it is unlikely that energy could be continually supplied by the head ( main galaxy ) to its much lagging behind tail parts , especially through the two sharp bends . here",
    "it should be noted that at about half a billion years further back , the cmbr energy density and the equivalent magnetic field would be stronger which would make the inverse - compton losses from the cmbr to be still higher and consequently the radiative life - times to be shorter about 10 percent than those in table 2 .",
    "as explained earlier , for calculating radiative life times for ic  708 n and s components in table 2 we have used 5 ghz as the break frequency .    for both ic  711 and ic  708",
    ", twin jets start from the compact head almost in the same way ( figs . 2 and 5 ) and which conform to the basic model of jet - bending by begelman et al .",
    "( 1979 ) , but in case of ic  711 they soon merge together to form a single tail while in case of ic  708 they stay separate in the wat morphology and end up as individual lobes .",
    "it is still not clear what really decides the formation of these very distinct morphologies .",
    "ic  708 as compared to ic  711 is of course order of magnitude smaller in size ( unless geometric projections play a major role ) . from coleman",
    "et al . ( 1976 ) , their parent optical galaxies do not seem to differ much in their speeds of motion within the cluster .",
    "it does not seem that the icm density could have very large gradients to cause large difference at the positions of these two radio galaxies .",
    "this is because ic  711 at least samples a fairly large fraction of the cluster expanse and its tail does not seem to vary much in its width over its large extent .",
    "their estimates of @xmath30 do differ by about a factor of three ( table 2 ) .",
    "in addition to ic  711 and ic  708 , another cluster member , ic  712 , the galaxy near the center of the cluster , has an unresolved radio source associated with it which has a normal radio spectrum .",
    "further , there are four optically unidentified radio sources , u1 , u2 , u3 and u4 ( fig .",
    "1 ) , which do not seem associated with any of the cluster members and most likely are independent background radio sources .",
    "u1 possesses a clear double structure but surprisingly shows a flat spectrum between 240 and 610 mhz .",
    "u2 , a normal spectrum radio source ( table 2 ) , lies an arcmin south of ic  708 ( fig .",
    "5 ) but is quite clearly not associated with it . u3 and u4 could of special interest as each of them lies very close to one of the two sharp bends seen in the radio tail of ic  711 ( fig .",
    "1 ) . however",
    "their optically unidentified nature as well as a clear double radio structure of u3 and the fact that u4 is an unresolved flat spectrum radio source , makes both of them unrelated to ic  711 ( or even to the abell cluster 1314 itself ) and their closeness in sky positions to tail - bends of ic  711 are mere chance coincidences .",
    "radio tail of ic  711 not only seems to be straight most of its length ( except for the two sharp bends mentioned earlier ) , it also seems to remain confined to quite a narrow width without any lateral free - expansion of the tail material , perhaps confined by the pressure of the icm .",
    "the minimum energy of the tail may be used to estimate the pressure in the icm , whose emissivity is otherwise not directly detectable , by assuming that the diffuse parts of the radio tail are in pressure equilibrium with it .",
    "the pressure of such a hot , diffuse , non - relativistic icm could be thus estimated .",
    "our estimate for the pressure in the tail part yields @xmath48 dyne @xmath49 under the assumption of minimum energy in the radio tail and its pressure balance with the icm in the cluster .",
    "we presented low - frequency , gmrt observations at 240 , 610 and 1300 mhz of ic  711 , a long head - tail radio galaxy , perhaps the longest known head - tail radio galaxy .",
    "our high resolution 610 mhz map showed a long straight tail of angular extent @xmath3 arcmin , and later two sharp bends in the tail .",
    "the radio structure , especially the long straight tail , does not seem to be consistent with a simple circular motion around the cluster centre , as previously suggested in the literature .",
    "each of the bends in the tail of ic  711 seems to occur very close to a prominent radio source , though it is not sure whether either of the bend is really related to the respective radio object .",
    "we are not even sure whether the radio sources close to the bends are cluster members , since no optical galaxy is found at either of them .",
    "therefore either or both of these two radio sources could be background or even foreground object , though the bending of the tail so close to them in sky is a very striking feature .",
    "we thank the staff of the gmrt that made these observations possible .",
    "gmrt is run by the national centre for radio astrophysics of the tata institute of fundamental research .",
    "this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , caltech , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
    "we derive here an expression for minimum energy in a synchrotron source where a break is seen in the power - law spectrum of the observed flux - density .",
    "such a break can occur in the synchrotron spectrum due to radiation losses in the case where , e.g. , there is an isotropic distribution of electrons or if in the radiating region there is a continuous injection of fresh electrons with a power law energy distribution ( kardashev 1962 ; pacholczyk 1970 ) .",
    "we use cgs system of units throughout .",
    "a relativistic electron of rest mass @xmath50 and energy @xmath51 ( corresponding to a lorentz factor @xmath52 ) , gyrating in a uniform magnetic field @xmath53 with a gyro frequency @xmath54 , emits most of its radiation in a narrow frequency band around its characteristic synchrotron frequency ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) @xmath55 where @xmath56 ( pacholczyk 1970 ) and @xmath57 is the pitch angle .",
    "accordingly , with the assumption that almost all the radiation from an electron is at a frequency @xmath58 , we can write a one - to - one relation between the frequency at which synchrotron radiation is being emitted and the energy @xmath51 of the electron emitting that radiation @xmath59 in radio sources , the observed flux density in the optically thin part of the spectrum usually follows a power law , i.e. , @xmath60 , between the lower and upper cut off frequencies @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in synchrotron",

    "in synchrotron radiation there is a paradox whether or not the pitch angle of a radiating charge varies .",
    "the conventional wisdom is that the pitch angle does not change during the radiation process . since the radiation is confined to a narrow cone of angle @xmath112 around the instantaneous direction of motion of the charge , ( jackson 1975 ; pacholczyk 1970 ; rybicky & lightman 1979 ) , any radiation reaction on the charge will be in a direction just opposite to its instantaneous velocity vector .",
    "this means that the direction of motion of the charge will remain unaffected , implying no change in the pitch angle of the charge ( kardashev 1962 ; pacholczyk 1970 ) .",
    "the accordingly derived formulas for energy losses of synchrotron electrons in radio galaxies are the standard text - book material for the last 50 years . however , using the momentum transformation laws from special relativity , we shall show that the pitch angle of a radiating charge varies .",

    "however from equation  ( [ eq:30.4 ] ) one can easily see that while it might be true for a highly relativistic charge ( @xmath120 ) , it can not be a general result .",

    "however , magnitude of the perpendicular component of velocity is continuously decreasing because of radiative losses , therefore the pitch angle of the charge , @xmath131 , should decrease continuously with time and the velocity vector of the charge should increasingly align with the magnetic field vector .",
    "thus we have a paradox here . while an argument based on the standard picture of larmor s radiation losses had led us to the conclusion that the pitch angle of the charge is a constant , the later argument from relativistic transformation considerations showed that as the charge radiates its pitch angle could be progressively reducing with time .    in equation  ( [ eq:30.2 ] ) @xmath132 is a variable in the lab frame @xmath128 , but we can write this equation for the gc frame @xmath126 , where pitch angle is always a constant ( @xmath133 )",
    ". then we have @xmath134 now equation  ( [ eq:30.7 ] ) has a solution @xmath135 let @xmath136 be the initial energy at @xmath137 in frame @xmath126 , then @xmath138 and at time @xmath139 we have @xmath140 which complies with the expectations that as @xmath141 , @xmath142 .",
    "a transformation between @xmath126 and @xmath128 gives @xmath143 and @xmath144 or @xmath145 ( melrose 1971 ) , where @xmath146 .",
    "also we have @xmath147 or @xmath148 .",
    "for the transformation of acceleration we then get @xmath149 with @xmath150 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq:30.2e3 ] ) can be transformed in terms of quantities expresses in the lab frame @xmath128 @xmath151 thus we get @xmath52 as a function of time , starting from an initial @xmath152 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq:30.7 ] ) can be also written as @xmath153 it should be noted that magnetic field does no work and any change in @xmath154 is only due to the radiation losses and @xmath155 is in a direction opposite to @xmath156 in the gc frame .      then transforming to the lab frame @xmath128 we have @xmath158 both @xmath159 and @xmath57 appearing in @xmath160 are functions of time . also @xmath161 .",
    "thence we get @xmath162 which gives us the rate of change of pitch angle with time .",
    "the expressions for the pitch angle changes and the radiation losses could be derived in an alternate way directly from the radiation reaction force ( singal 2016 ) , where it is also shown that @xmath163 is the characteristic decay time of a synchrotron electron over which it not only turns from ultra relativistic into mildly relativistic one , but due to the change in the pitch angle during this time , its velocity vector also moves outside the angle @xmath164 around the line of sight towards the observer .    however , on a much shorter time scale @xmath165 where @xmath166 and for not too small a pitch angle , @xmath167 , implying @xmath168 ( as @xmath169 ) , from equation  ( [ eq:30.2e4 ] ) we could write @xmath170 or @xmath171 equation  ( [ eq:30.2 g ] ) is the same relation as equation  ( [ eq:30.4 ] ) , but which now we know is valid only for @xmath172 , @xmath173 and for pitch angles not too small ( @xmath167 ) .    from equations  ( [ eq:30.2f ] ) and ( [ eq:30.2 g ] ) it is easily seen that irrespective of the initial energy @xmath152 of the radiating electron at time @xmath116 , at a later time @xmath117 , its energy will have an upper limit @xmath174 .",
    "this in turn tells us about the radiating life - times of the synchrotron electrons @xmath175 from equation  ( [ eq:64b ] ) , a synchrotron electron with energy @xmath52 radiates around @xmath176 with an exponential drop in flux density above frequency @xmath177 .",
    "therefore an upper limit @xmath178 implies an upper limit on frequency @xmath179 above which the flux density falls exponentially .    from a sharp steepening of the observed spectrum one gets the value of @xmath179 and then an estimate the age of the synchrotron source is obtained as @xmath180 provided",
    "an estimate of magnetic field @xmath53 is available , e.g. , from the minimum energy estimates ( equation  ( [ eq:64q1 ] ) ) which yields nearly an equipartition value of the magnetic field .",

    "<S> the radio structure , especially initial @xmath3 arcmin of tail being a long straight feature , does not seem to be consistent with a simple circular motion around the cluster centre , as previously suggested in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> two sharp bends after the straight section of the tail cast doubt on the prevailing idea in the literature that the long narrow tails represent trails left behind by the fast moving parent optical galaxy with respect to the cluster medium , as the optical galaxy could not have undergone such sharp bends in its path , under any conceivable gravitational influence of some individual galaxy or of the overall cluster gravitational potential . </S>",
    "<S> in fact the tail does not seem to have been influenced by the gravitational field of any of the cluster - member galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the radio tail shows a break in the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we derive an expression for the minimum energy in the case of a spectral break , in order to do the minimum energy calculation in diffuse tail regions of ic  711 . </S>"
