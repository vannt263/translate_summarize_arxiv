    "finite - size electron systems linked to non - interacting electron reservoirs have been a topic of intense theoretical and experimental study because of their relevance to quantum dot systems and single - molecule devices .",
    "depending on the importance of correlation effects induced by the electron - electron coulomb repulsion , different types of theoretical approaches are employed . for weakly correlated systems ,",
    "ballistic electron transport is studied within the one - electron approximation such as density - functional theory ( dft).@xcite on the other hand , strongly correlated systems are modeled by tight - binding hamiltonians with hubbard- or anderson - type interaction terms and various many - body techniques are applied .",
    "two noticeable effects beyond the one - electron approximation are the kondo effect and coulomb blockade , both of which are observed in quantum dot systems .",
    "@xcite more recently , the kondo effect was also observed in adsorbed molecules by scanning tunneling spectroscopy and high - resolution photoemission spectroscopy.@xcite the kondo effect in nano - size systems was studied theoretically by using the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) technique for a variety of cases , such as multi - dot or multi - level systems and dots coupled to superconducting leads,@xcite within dft combined with the one - crossing approximation@xcite and the continuous - time quantum monte carlo technique.@xcite coulomb blockade effects seen in electron transport through a finite - size interacting system are investigated by using rate - equation techniques and non - equilibrium green s function theory . @xcite    the aim of the present work is to introduce a new scheme for the investigation of quantum dots that is applicable in the full range between kondo physics and coulomb blockade , except in the limit of extremely low kondo temperatures . to illustrate this approach",
    ", we focus on small interacting molecules coupled to non - interacting semi - infinite electron reservoirs .",
    "the many - body properties of these systems are evaluated by using exact diagonalization ( ed ) at finite temperatures.@xcite in order to apply ed , the semi - infinite leads are simulated by finite - size clusters . for a given chemical potential ,",
    "the tight - binding hamiltonian parameters of these clusters are chosen such that the difference between the surface - site green s function of a semi - infinite lead and the corresponding cluster lead is minimized along the matsubara axis .",
    "the finite - temperature green s function of the total system consisting of molecule and lead clusters is then evaluated exactly within ed .",
    "since the effective lead  cluster hamiltonian is extremely sparse , at typical temperatures of interest only a limited number of excited states needs to be evaluated .",
    "here we consider hubbard chain and ring molecules attached to two metallic leads . in these systems lead clusters consisting of only five bath levels can accurately mimic the true embedding potentials down to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 denotes the hopping parameter representing the metallic leads .",
    "thus , the formation of kondo resonances within the correlation - induced pseudogaps can be investigated . in the case of single leads",
    ", the problem reduces to the single - impurity anderson model .",
    "the cluster size can then be significantly increased so that much lower temperatures can be reached .",
    "an additional advantage of our method is that the zero - bias - voltage limit of the interacting system can be studied for arbitrary values of the coulomb repulsion and molecule - lead hybridization , without further approximations .",
    "the discretization of the semi - infinite leads and the application of ed to the resulting finite - size system is analogous to the use of ed as impurity solver within the context of dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) and its cluster extensions@xcite where the weiss mean - field is represented by a finite number of non - interacting levels .",
    "multi - orbital as well as multi - site correlations have been studied for a variety of materials , @xcite including various surfaces and heterostructures .",
    "@xcite the main difference is that in the present case the leads are assumed to be non - interacting , so that the self - consistent iterative procedure is absent .",
    "an important feature of the ed approach is that it provides complete dynamical information , in particular , transfer of spectral weight between low and high excitation energies , formation of hubbard bands , and opening of correlation - induced pseudogaps .",
    "a quantity of central interest therefore is the molecular self - energy which exhibits strong variations as a function of hamiltonian parameters and temperature . in particular , fermi - liquid behavior in the kondo regime and",
    "correlation - induced finite scattering rates in the coulomb blockade regime can clearly be identified .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec_2 ]",
    "we describe our theoretical model for the molecule  lead system and discuss several details of the calculation of the molecular self - energy and interacting green s function . in section [ sec_3 ]",
    "we present the numerical results and the discussion , with special emphasis on the coulomb blockade and kondo effect .",
    "section [ sec_4 ] contains the summary . in the appendix we consider a single adatom on a semi - infinite lead and",
    "examine the temperature range in which a finite - size cluster can be used to simulate a semi - infinite lead . since this case is equivalent to the single - impurity anderson model , the results",
    "can directly be compared with those of other schemes that are applicable at arbitrarily low temperatures .",
    "we consider a molecule consisting of @xmath2 atomic sites and linked to two semi - infinite metal leads , as shown schematically in fig .  [ fig_md](a ) .",

    "<S> the electronic structure of small hubbard molecules coupled between two non - interacting semi - infinite leads is studied in the low bias - voltage limit . to calculate the finite - temperature green s function of the system , </S>",
    "<S> each lead is simulated by a small cluster , so that the problem is reduced to that of a finite - size system comprising the molecule and clusters on both sides . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian parameters of the lead clusters are chosen such that their embedding potentials coincide with those of the semi - infinite leads on matsubara frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> exact diagonalization is used to evaluate the effect of coulomb correlations on the electronic properties of the molecule at finite temperature . </S>",
    "<S> depending on key hamiltonian parameters , such as coulomb repulsion , one - electron hopping within the molecule , and hybridization between molecule and leads , the molecular self - energy is shown to exhibit fermi - liquid behavior or deviations associated with finite low - energy scattering rates . </S>",
    "<S> the method is shown to be sufficiently accurate to describe the formation of kondo resonances inside the correlation - induced pseudogaps , except in the limit of extremely low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> these results demonstrate how the system can be tuned between the coulomb blockade and kondo regimes . </S>"
