    "in statistical physics , exact solutions such as onsager s theory for a two - dimensional ( 2d ) ising model , the bethe ansatz for 1d quantum systems @xcite , the matrix product method @xcite , etc , have played important roles .",
    "besides exact solutions , there are rigorous theorems such as the mermin - wagner theorem , the marshall - lieb - mattis theorem @xcite , the lieb - schultz - mattis theorem @xcite etc , which do not give quantitative , but qualitative results .",
    "since such rigorous theorems are based on symmetries , they can be applied to broader models .",
    "and one can use them to check the consistency of approximations , experiments , or numerical data .",
    "lieb , schultz and mattis ( lsm ) @xcite studied the s=1/2 xxz spin chain . in appendix b of their paper , they described two theorems . in the first theorem ,",
    "it was proved that the ground state is unique in finite @xmath2 systems . in the second theorem",
    ", they proved that there exists a low - energy @xmath3 excited state ; in the infinite limit , this means that either there are degenerate ground states or a vanishing gap .",
    "the first theorem was nothing more than an extension of marshall s theorem @xcite , and was later applied to more general cases ( higher dimensions , bipartite lattice , ferrimagnetism , etc . ) by @xcite , therefore it is appropriate to call the first theorem the `` marshal - lieb - mattis ( mlm ) theorem '' .",
    "the mlm theorem was applied to the spin model with biquadratic exchange @xcite . since",
    "the perron - frobenius theorem is used in the mlm theorem , it is limited in the non - frustrated case .    the second lsm theorem was extended for general spin @xmath4 and was applied for various models by @xcite , and it was proven that there exists a low - energy @xmath3 excited state for half - odd - integer spin cases .",
    "it is worth noting that the assumptions of the mlm theorem and those of the second lsm theorem are independent , though this fact has been overlooked .",
    "hereafter we call the second lsm theorem alone the lsm theorem . in this paper we shall extend the lsm theorem without the assumption of the uniqueness of the ground state , using a squeeze theorem type discussion .",
    "therefore , we can extend the lsm theorem for frustrated systems .",
    "on the other hand , kolb @xcite studied the energy spectra of the xxz spin chain with the twist boundary condition , independent of @xcite .",
    "he obtained similar conclusions regarding the two - fold degenerate ground state for the @xmath4 half - odd - integer case .",
    "he also pointed out the change of the wave vector when varying the twist boundary condition for nonzero total spin @xmath5 cases . in section",
    "ii of @xcite , combining kolb s idea and lsm theorem , fth and slyom insisted that they proved the continuity of the dispersion curve for @xmath0 .",

    "@xcite , using the lsm type discussion , pointed out that there may be magnetic plateaux .",
    "in addition , they emphasized the importance of either the space inversion or the spin reversal symmetry , besides the u(1 ) and the translational symmetry .",
    "although the proof of the lsm theorem becomes simplified with the assumption of discrete symmetry , it excludes nonsymmetric spin models .    in this paper",
    "we prove the lsm theorem , by using only the assumptions of the u(1 ) symmetry , the translational invariance and the short - range interaction .",
    "there is no need for the uniqueness of the ground state for a finite system , the space inversion or the spin reversal symmetry assumptions , which means we can extend the lsm theorem for frustrating or nonsymmetric models ( e.g. dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction @xcite ) .",
    "the layout of the paper as follows . in section 2 , we introduce the definition of symmetry operations .",
    "section 3 is the main part of this work : we prove the continuity and the periodicity of the lowest energy spectra as a function of wave number @xmath1 , assuming the u(1 ) and the translational symmetries plus the short - range interaction .",
    "furthermore , in section 4 we discuss the discrete symmetries , i.e. the space inversion and the spin reversal .",
    "we consider several specific spin models with various lattice structures and symmetries in section 5 . in section 6 , using the nonfrustration condition ( model specific nature ) , we can discuss the minimum location of spectra .",
    "in section 7 , we compare our theorems with @xcite and @xcite . in section 8 ,",
    "we illustrate possible spectra for frustrating systems , those for magnetization plateau , and those for nonsymmetric case .",
    "section 9 is the conclusion .",
    "in this section we consider the symmetries of the spin chain . as a typical model , we treat the following 1d generalized xxz spin hamiltonian : @xmath6 where @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , with the system size @xmath2 even and the periodic boundary condition ( pbc ) : @xmath9 hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian - generalized - xxz ] ) is invariant under the space inversion .",

    "we have also extended the lsm theorem for nonsymmetric case , for example , the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction .",
    "regarding the continuity of the lowest energy spectra in the @xmath217 subspace , we have completed insufficient points of previous works @xcite , since they used inequality relation only once .",
    "relating to this , oshikawa @xcite stated `` that the incommensurate filling gives a gapless spectrum is empirically recognized more or less '' , and he tried to prove it with topological arguments .",
    "although his argument is intuitive , it is not convincing .",
    "there are several remarks .",
    "first , on the ordering of the lowest energies of each @xmath5 subspace ; one can say nothing about it from the extended lsm theorem itself .",
    "secondly , the lowest energy states in the @xmath90 subspace may be discontinuous as a function of wave number @xmath1 , which is natural , considering nel or dimer states or magnetic plateaux .",
    "thirdly , cautions should be taken on the number of spins in the unit cell .",
    "finally , the original lsm theorem has also been extended for fermion systems on the lattice @xcite",
    ". it will be interesting to consider our methods for fermion models with frustration .",
    "we would like to thank hosho katsura for pointing out @xcite and references therein .",
    "k. n. wishes to thank tohru koma for the suggestion that the space inversion assumption is not necesssary for the lsm - type theorem .",
