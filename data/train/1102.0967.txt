    "rxte has a large effective area , in excess of 1000 @xmath11 at energies in the range of 5 - 12 kev , making it far superior to swift , suzaku , xmm , chandra , and asca in sensitivity to non - thermal emission from groups and low temperature clusters .",
    "the rxte pca is also ideal for detecting non - thermal gas from a low temperature cluster or group because it has high sensitivity up to 15 kev without significant particle background contamination .",
    "thermal emission is generally predicted to increase more strongly than non - thermal emission with increasing temperature ( or mass ) . as a result , detection of non - thermal emission by non - imaging instruments",

    "the estimated dead time is 10@xmath15 seconds per event . for a high count rate object , such as the crab , 13,000 cps ,",
    "this is 0.13 dead sec / sec and can lead to an underestimate of the crab flux by 6% if not accounted for .",
    "however , for ngc 5044 , with a gross pca count rate of 17.5 cps , has a total dead time of 45 sec over the 260 ksec observation , which is negligible for the absolute flux calibration of the ngc 5044 .",

    "( 2003)(jahoda et al . 2006 ) .",

    "addition of a powerlaw to the thermal and cxb emission provides the best fitting model .",
    "the addition of a powerlaw with spectral index 2.64 - 2.82 and luminosity of 2.6@xmath010@xmath1 ergs s@xmath2 provides the best fit to the data with a @xmath17 of 249 for 222 degrees of freedom ( see figure 4 ) .",

    "the decrease in @xmath17 from the thermal model improves the chance probability to 10% .",
    "the reduced @xmath17 is higher than one due to random fluctuations in a few pspc channels and residuals from multiphase gas not fully modeled in the 3 - 6 kev .",

    "fitting rxte pca and a co - spatial rosat pspc spectrum indicates that the preferred model for the x - ray emission includes non - thermal emission that is accurately modeled with a power law with a steep spectral index , 2.6 - 2.8 , and x - ray luminosity of 2.6@xmath010@xmath1 ergs s@xmath2 in the 0.5 - 15 kev band . after accounting for non - thermal emission from bright point sources in the pspc ,",

    "the spectrum is relatively flat so that , compared to a steep spectrum x - ray source , it underpredicts the 2 - 7 kev emission and over predicts the 8 - 15 kev emission . in figures 2 -4 , the dependence of the unfolded spectrum on the assumed model is visible .",
