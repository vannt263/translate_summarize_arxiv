    "the research on discrete maximum principles can be traced back to the early paper of ciarlet and raviart @xcite in the nineteen seventies . provided a non - obtuse triangulation , they established a discrete maximum principle for scalar valued linear second order elliptic problems on a two dimensional domain .",
