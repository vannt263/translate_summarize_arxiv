    "the concept of symmetry plays a central role in our current understanding of physics at its most fundamental level .",
    "the invariance of physical laws under rotation symmetry is perhaps the most basic example , and for such it is worthwhile to test its validity with high accuracy .",
    "moreover , it has been argued that a breakdown of rotation symmetry , or more generally lorentz symmetry , could arise from quantum gravity effects .",
    "the high level of precision reached by modern tests of rotation symmetry opens the possibility to observe tiny manifestations of the physics at the planck scale . here",
    "we describe an experiment performed recently with ultracold neutrons based on spin dynamics @xcite .",
    "picture a neutron sitting in an environment free of magnetic field ( and electric field ) .",
    "one consequence of rotation invariance is the fact that the neutron spin should be stationary , since there is no direction around which it could turn around .",
    "if the neutron spin were rotating around a direction @xmath0 at a nonzero frequency @xmath1 ( @xmath2 is the planck constant ) , we would observe a breakdown of the rotation invariance .",
    "such an effect is parametrized by the exotic potential @xmath3 , where @xmath4 are the pauli matrices acting on the neutron spin states .",
    "the vector @xmath0 , so - called _ cosmic spin anisotropy field _ , defines a priviliged direction in the universe .",
    "now if a neutron is subjected to both a static magnetic field @xmath5 and the new field @xmath0 , its spin will precess at the modified larmor frequency @xmath6 , which to first order in @xmath7 is given by : @xmath8 if we keep the magnetic field @xmath5 static in the laboratory frame fixed on earth , say vertical , then the scalar product @xmath9 will be daily modulated as the earth is rotating . searching for a daily modulation in the larmor frequency in a static magnetic field",
    "probes the component @xmath10 of @xmath0 orthogonal to the earth s rotation axis .",
    "the presented result is in fact a _ clock comparison experiment _ in that the neutron larmor frequency is compared to the precession frequency of a co - habiting @xmath11hg magnetometer . in the last section of this article",
    "we will discuss our result in regard with the numerous previous clock comparison experiments , in particular those performed with @xmath11hg .",
    "the first clock comparison experiments were performed by hughes @xcite and drever @xcite .",
    "they were motivated by testing mach s principle , aiming at detecting a dependence of the zeeman energy of nuclei as a function of the relative orientation of the direction of the magnetic field and the direction to the galactic center . nowadays",
    "these searches follow the development of a general formalism for lorentz violation called the standard model extension ( sme ) @xcite that parametrizes all lorentz - violating effects possibly induced by the yet unknown planck scale physics .",
    "the sme contains a number of terms that violate local lorentz invariance , among which is the cosmic axial field @xmath0 .",
    "experimental setups to resolve changes in neutron larmor precession frequency have been in constant development over the past 50 years with the goal of detecting a non zero neutron electric dipole moment . for this test of rotation symmetry",
    "we used the most sentive one of such apparatus available today , namely the oill apparatus .",
    "the oill spectrometer has been built and operated at the pf2 beamline at ill by the sussex / ral / ill collaboration and it holds the world record limit on the neutron electric dipole moment @xcite .",
    "it is now operated by an european collaboration in view of a more sensitive measurement @xcite at the paul scherrer institut where it will profit from a more intense ultracold neutron source .",
    "the data reported in this article has been collected at the ill in 2008 , the year preceding the move of the apparatus .",
    "figure [ oillpict ] shows schematically the oill spectrometer .",
    "the oill apparatus uses ultracold neutrons , neutrons with kinetic energy of about @xmath12  nev .",
    "those neutrons are reflected at all angles of incidence by most materials and can be stored in material bottles for a very long time . in a typical cycle",
    "the ucns are guided from the source to a storage volume ( a cylinder , 12  cm height and 47  cm diameter ) , filling the volume for about 40  s before closing the ucn valve . on the way to the storage volume",
    "they are polarized when passing through a magnetized ferromagnetic foil .",
    "after the completion of the ramsey procedure described below , the ucn valve is opened again and the neutrons fall down into a he detector where they are counted . on the way to the detector",
    "they pass again through the magnetized foil that serves as a spin analyser .",
    "figure [ storage ] shows the number of ucn counts as a function of the duration of the storage time . from the nearly exponential decrease of the neutron count rate",
    "we extract the ucn storage time of @xmath13  s in the oill chamber .",
    "the storage curve departs from a simple exponential behaviour because different parts of the ucn energy spectrum have different storage times .",
    "the chamber is exposed to a static vertical magnetic field of @xmath14 t , corresponding to a larmor frequency of @xmath15  hz . during the storage of polarized ucn the ramsey method of separated oscillatory fields",
    "is applied , in order to measure @xmath6 accurately .",
    "an initial oscillating horizontal field pulse of frequency @xmath16 is applied for 2  s. it flips the neutron spin by @xmath17 .",
    "then the ucn spins precess freely around the @xmath18 field , for typically @xmath19  s. a second @xmath17 pulse , in phase with the first pulse , is then applied .",
    "the ramsey procedure is resonant .",
    "it flips the neutron spin by @xmath20 only when @xmath21 .",
    "figure [ ramsey ] shows a measured ramsey resonance : the vertical component of ucn spins as a function of the pulse frequency @xmath16 . to optimize the sensitivity to a change in the larmor frequency we operate at @xmath16 corresponding to equal spin up and spin down counts in the sides of the central ramsey fringe where the slope is the steepest .",
    "one can show that each cycle gives a measurement of the larmor frequency @xmath6 with a statistical accuracy of : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the number of neutron counts , and @xmath24 is the polarization of the neutrons at the end of the storage period . in operating conditions this was of the order of @xmath25hz .",
    "to resolve a daily modulation in the neutron larmor frequency , one has to make sure that the magnetic field @xmath18 is not fluctuating too much .",
    "the control of the magnetic field is the most critical issue for nedm spectrometers and involves a great deal of shielding , shaping and monitoring of the magnetic field .",
    "first , the storage chamber is surrounded by a four layer mumetal magnetic shield that protects the experiment against variations of the external field .",
    "the shielding factor against slow changes of the outside vertical field was measured to be about @xmath26 .",
    "but this is far from being enough to lower the inner field fluctuations below the statistical accuracy ( [ statacc ] ) of the neutron cycles , as is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ comagnetometer ] . to gain control over the residual magnetic field fluctuations ,",
    "a unique feature of the oill spectrometer is the mercury comagnetometer @xcite . within the neutron storage chamber , nuclear spin - polarized @xmath11hg atoms precess in the same magnetic field as the neutrons .",
    "the larmor frequency @xmath27  hz of the mercury atoms is measured optically , by recording the oscillation of the transmission of polarized resonant light .",
    "the mercury comagnetometer provides a field average measurement for each cycle , with the same time average as for the neutrons , at an accuracy of @xmath28hz .",
    "the performance of such a method is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ comagnetometer ] where the neutron frequency is corrected for changes of the magnetic field using the comagnetometer .",

    "the data are folded modulo 23.9345 hours and binned every half hour . ]",
    "the fact that the fluctuations of the magnetic field are suppressed below the statistical sensitivity was used to search for a daily modulation of the neutron larmor frequency . for each measurement cycle",
    "we form the ratio of the neutron to mercury larmor frequency @xmath29 .",
    "this ratio is free from magnetic field fluctuations .",
    "then we parametrize the signal for the daily modulation by the amplitude @xmath30 and the phase @xmath31 : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the sidereal angular frequency , @xmath34 are the gyromagnetic ratio of the neutron and the mercury atoms , and @xmath35 is a constant systematic shift that can occur for example due to magnetic field gradients , discussed in the next section .    in 2008",
    "two series of runs have been conducted .",
    "the first series , recorded in april - may 2008 contains in total 4.6 days of data in three different continuous runs .",
    "this series was analysed @xcite and no daily modulation was found in the ratio @xmath36 .",
    "an upper limit on the maximum amplitude of the modulation was reported @xmath37  ( 95 % c.l . ) using a frequentist statistical method . in magnetic field units",
    "this would correspond to @xmath38  ft .",
    "a second series was recorded in december 2008 , consisting of three continuous runs of 5.6 days in total . in this series",
    "an electric field was applied , with reversed direction every 2  hours for a nedm measurement .",
    "since the frequency of the e field reversal is large compared to the sidereal frequency the electric field does not affect this analysis even if the neutron edm were enormous .",
    "in this article we present a combined analysis of both series , searching for a daily modulation . for each run",
    "the average value of @xmath36 has been subtracted , resulting in a subtracted value @xmath39 for each cycle , with a standard error @xmath40 .",
    "[ binned ] shows an overview of all data , folded modulo @xmath41 .",

    "the whole dataset is compatible with a signal of null amplitude ( reduced @xmath42 ) .    .",

    "a systematic effect could arise due to imperfect monitoring of the magnetic field by the comagnetometer .",
    "if the source of this imperfection is daily modulated it could in principle hide a true cosmic signal .",
    "the only known relevant effect is the so - called gravitational shift .",
    "the mercury atoms form a gas at room temperature and fill the storage volume with a uniform density . on the contrary",
    ", the ucn gas is affected by gravity and the ucn density is significantly higher at the bottom of the storage chamber than at the top .",
    "this results in a difference in center of mass height @xmath49 of the two species , that in turn results in a shift of the ratio @xmath36 in the presence of a vertical gradient @xmath50 of the magnetic field : @xmath51    a first estimate of @xmath49 can be obtained from the kinetic theory of gases .",
    "the maximum energy of stored ucn in the chamber is the fermi potential of the weakest wall , i.e. @xmath52  nev for the quartz insulator ring .",
    "we can assign a temperature @xmath53 to the ucn gas by the matching of the mean energy : @xmath54 , that is , @xmath55  mk .",
    "assuming `` thermal '' equilibrium for the ucn gas the distribution of height can be derived together with the center of mass offset : : @xmath56 where @xmath57  cm is the height of the storage chamber .",
    "this is only an estimate since the ucn energies are certainly not distributed according to the maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "a dedicated experiment was performed to directly observe the gravitational shift ( [ gravshift ] ) using four cesium magnetometers @xcite running in parallel with the neutron and mercury systems .",
    "these magnetometers were placed as described in fig .",
    "[ cesium ] , two above the storage chamber and two below , allowing to measure the magnetic field gradient @xmath58 .",
    "the magnetic field gradient could be adjusted using correction coils at the top and at the bottom of the vacuum chamber .",

    "each point corresponds to a different magnetic field configuration , i.e. different currents in the correction coils .",
    "the correlation is that expected from ( [ gravshift ] ) , with a measured center of gravity offset of @xmath59  mm .",
    "this is in fairly good agreement with the naive estimate ( [ gastheory ] ) .",

    "a daily modulation of the magnetic field gradient would induce a false modulation of the @xmath36 ratio through eq .",

    "the gradients were measured online with the cesium magnetometers , as shown in fig .",
    "[ gradients ] . from this measurement",
    "we extracted the daily modulated fourier component of this signal , with an amplitude of @xmath60  pt / m . the statistical analysis presented in the previous section",
    "was repeated , this time with a modulation of amplitude @xmath61  ppm superimposed to the data .",
    "the worse case scenario ( the worse phase of the superimposed oscillation ) leads to the corrected bound : @xmath62 the systematic effect just discussed is still negligible , but would become an issue for future experiments at the paul scherrer institut with improved statistics .",
    "the result ( [ astatsys ] ) can be interpreted in terms of a limit on the cosmic spin anisotropy field @xmath0 for the free neutron .",
    "the amplitude @xmath30 is related to the component @xmath10 of @xmath0 orthogonal to the earth rotation axis : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the latitude of the experiment .",
    "thus we extract a limit on the small energy scale associated to the breakdown of rotation symmetry : @xmath65 this limit constitutes a improvement by a factor of two compared to our previous analysis @xcite based on only part of the data ( @xmath66  ev ) .",
    "the new dataset added ( december 2008 ) to the analysis was taken 7 months apart from the first dataset ( april - may 2008 ) .",
    "this is ideal to cancel any day - night fluctuations because the day - night phase and the sidereal phase are in @xmath20 phase opposition after 6 months . in this respect ,",
