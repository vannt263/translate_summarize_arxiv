    "in economics and finance , an essential problem is how to model people s preference over uncertain outcomes . to address this problem , @xcite ( originally published in 1738 ) proposed _ expected utility theory _ ( eut ) : any uncertain outcome @xmath0",

    "hence , under bernoulli s setting ( eut ) , a rational individual seeks to maximize expected utility @xmath1 $ ] over all available choices .",
    "bernoulli s original eut was formally established by von neumann and morgenstern ( thus the theory is also called _ von neumann - morgenstern utility theorem _ ) .",
    "@xcite show that any individual whose behavior satisfies certain axioms has a utility function @xmath7 and always prefers outcomes that maximize the expected utility . since then",
    ", expected utility maximization has been one of the most widely used criteria for optimization problems concerning uncertainty , see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite for optimal investment problems ( also called portfolio selection problems ) .",
    "however , empirical experiment and research show that human behaviors may violate the basic tenets of eut , e.g. , allais paradox challenges a fundamental axiom_independence axiom_of eut",
    ". please refer to @xcite for many designed choice problems whose results can not be explained by eut .",
    "alternative theories are then proposed to address the drawbacks of eut , such as _ prospect theory _ by @xcite , _ rank - dependent utility _ by @xcite , and _ cumulative prospect theory _ ( cpt ) by @xcite .",

    "the majority of existing literature on optimal investment problems with transaction costs , including those mentioned above , pursue analysis for an investor who behaves according to eut .    in this paper , we consider optimal investment problems under the cpt framework in a discrete - time model with transaction costs , which , to our best knowledge , has not been studied before .",
