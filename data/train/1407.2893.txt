    "scholars of science have noted for decades that collaborative research teams have been growing in size and importance  @xcite . at the same time , however , social loafing , where individuals apply less effort to a task when they are in a group than when they are alone , may counterbalance the effectiveness of larger teams  @xcite .",

    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : methods ] we describe our github dataset ; give definitions of a team , team success , and work activity / focus of a team member ; and introduce metrics to measure various aspects of the experience and experiential diversity of a team s members .",
    "in sec .  [",
    "sec : results ] we present our results relating these measures to team success . in sec .",
    "[ subsec : combined ] we present statistical tests on linear regression models of team features to control for potential confounds between team features and team success .",
    "lastly , we conclude with a discussion in sec .  [",
    "sec : discuss ] .",
    "public github data covering 1 january 2013 to 1 april 2014 was collected from githubarchive.org in april 2014 . in their own words , `` github archive is a project to record the public github timeline , archive it , and make it easily accessible for further analysis '' .",
    "these activity traces contain approximately 110 m unique events , including when users create , join , or update projects .",
    "projects on github are called `` repositories '' . for this work",
    "we define a * team * as the set of users who can directly update ( `` push to '' ) a repository .",
    "these users constitute the * primary * team members as they have either created the project or been granted autonomy to work on the project .",
    "the number of team members was denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "activity or workload @xmath3 was estimated from the number of pushes .",
    "a push is a bundle of code updates ( known as commits ) , however most pushes contain only a single commit ( see ; see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . as with all studies measuring worker effort from lines - of - code metrics ,",
    "this is an imperfect measure as the complexity of a unit of work does not generally map to the quantity of edits .",
    "users on github can bookmark projects they find interesting .",
    "this is called `` stargazing '' .",
    "we take the maximum number of stargazers for a team as its measure of * success * @xmath1 .",
    "this is a popularity measure of success , however the choice to bookmark a project does imply it offers some value to the user . to avoid abandoned projects , studied teams have at least one stargazer ( @xmath4 ) and at least two updates per month on average within the githubarchive data .",
    "these selection criteria leave @xmath5 teams .",
    "we also collect the time of creation on github for each team project .",
    "this is useful for measuring confounds : for example , older teams may tend to both have more members and have more opportunities to increase success",
    ". of the teams studied , 67.8% were formed within our data window .",
    "beyond considering team age as a potential confounder , we do not study temporal dynamics such as team formation in this work .",
    "a small number of studied teams ( 1.08% ) have more than ten primary members ( @xmath6 ) ; those teams were not shown in figures , but they were present in all statistical analyses .",
    "lastly , to ensure our results are not due to outliers , in some analyses we excluded teams above the 99th percentile of @xmath1 .",
    "despite a strong skew in the distribution of @xmath1 , these highly popular teams account for only 2.54% of the total work activity of the teams considered in this study ( 2.27% when considering teams with @xmath7 members ) .    [ [ secondary - team ] ] secondary team + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    github provides a mechanism for external , non - team contributors to propose work that team members can then choose to use or not .",
    "these proposals are called pull requests .",
    "( other mechanisms , such as discussions about issues , are also available to non - team contributors . )",
    "these secondary or external team contributors are not the focus of this work and have already been well studied by oss researchers  @xcite .",
    "however , it is important to ensure that they do not act as confounding factors for our results , since more successful teams will tend to have more secondary contributions than other teams .",
    "so we measure for each team @xmath8 , the number of unique users who submit at least one pull request , and @xmath9 the number of pull requests .",
    "we will include these measures in our combined regression models . despite their visibility in github , pull requests are rare  @xcite ; in our data , 57.7% of teams we study have @xmath10 , and when present pull requests are greatly outnumbered by pushes on average : @xmath11 ( median @xmath12 ) , averaged over all teams with at least one pull request .",
    "the number of team members , @xmath2 , does not fully represent the size of a team since the distribution of work may be highly skewed across team members . to capture the * effective team size * @xmath13 , accounting for the relative contribution levels of members ,",
    "we use @xmath14 , where @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the fraction of work performed by team member @xmath17 .",
    "this gives @xmath18 when all @xmath19 , as expected .",
    "this simple , entropic measure is known as perplexity in linguistics and is closely related to species diversity indices used in ecology and the herfindahl - hirschman index used in economics",
    ".      denote with @xmath20 the set of projects that user @xmath17 works on ( has pushed to ) .",
    "( projects in @xmath20 need at least twice - monthly updates on average , as before , but may have @xmath21 so as to better capture @xmath17 s background , not just successful projects . )",
    "we estimate the * experience * @xmath22 of a team of size @xmath2 as @xmath23 and the experiential * diversity * @xmath24 as @xmath25 where the sums and union run over the @xmath2 members of the team .",
    "note that @xmath26 .",
    "experience measures the quantity of projects the team works on while diversity measures how many or how few projects the team members have in common , the goal being to capture how often the team has worked together .",
    "lastly , someone is a * lead * when , for at least one project they work on , they contribute more work to that project than any other member . a non - lead member of team @xmath27 may be the lead of project @xmath28 .",
    "the number of leads @xmath29 in team @xmath30 of size @xmath31 is : @xmath32 where @xmath33 if user @xmath17 is the lead of team @xmath27 , and zero otherwise .",
    "the first sum runs over the @xmath34 members of team @xmath30 , the second runs over all projects @xmath27 .",
    "of course , the larger the team the more potential leads it may contain so when studying the effects of leads on team success we only compare teams of the same size ( comparing @xmath35 while holding @xmath2 fixed ) .",
    "otherwise , @xmath22 and @xmath24 already account for team size .",
    "we began our analysis by measuring team success @xmath1 as a function of team size @xmath2 , the number of primary contributors to the team s project .",
    "since @xmath1 is , at least partially , a popularity measure , we expect larger teams to also be more successful .",
    "indeed , there was a positive and significant relationship ( @xmath36 , rank correlation @xmath37 ) between the size of a team and its success , with 300% greater success on average for teams of size @xmath38 compared to solos with @xmath39 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : introtodata ] ) .",
    "this strong trend holds for the median success as well ( inset ) . while this observed trend was highly significant , the rank correlation @xmath40 indicates that there remains considerable variation in @xmath1 that is not captured by team size alone .",
    "our next analysis reveals an important relationship between team focus and success . unlike bibliographic studies , where teams can only be quantified as the listed coauthors of a paper ,",
    "the data here allow us to measure the intrinsic work or volume of contributions from each team member to the project . for each team we measured the contribution @xmath41 of a member to the team s ongoing project , how many times that member updated the project ( see methods ) .",
    "team members were ranked by contribution , so @xmath42 counts the work of the member who contributed the most , @xmath43 the second heaviest contributor , and so forth .",
    "the total work of a team is @xmath44 .",
    "we found that the distribution of work over team members showed significant skew , with @xmath42 often more than 23 times greater than @xmath43 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : teamsarefocused]a and ) .",
    "this means that the workloads of projects are predominantly carried by a handful of team members , or even just a single person .",
    "larger teams perform more total work , and the heaviest contributor carries much of that effort : the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : teamsarefocused]a shows that @xmath45 , the fraction of work carried by the rank one member , falls slowly with team size , and is typically far removed from the lower bound of equal work among all team members .",
    "see for more details .",
    "this result is in line with prior studies @xcite , supporting the plausibility of our definition of a team and our use of pushes to measure work .",
    "this focus in work activity indicates that the majority of the team serves as a support system for a core set of members .",
    "does this arrangement play a role in whether or not teams are successful ? we investigated this in several ways .",
    "first , we asked whether or not a team was * dominated * , meaning that the lead member contributed more work than all other members combined ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "highly successful `` top '' teams , those in the top 10% of the success distribution , were significantly more likely to be dominated than average teams , those in the middle 20% of @xmath1 , or `` bottom '' teams , those in bottom 10% of the @xmath1 .",
    "[ fig : teamsarefocused]b ) .",
    "can this result be due to a confounding effect from success ?",
    "more successful projects will tend to have more external contributors , for example , which can change the distribution of work .",
    "for example , in one scenario a team member may be a `` community manager '' merging in large numbers of external contributions from non - team members . to test this we examined only the 57.7% of teams that had no external contributions ( @xmath47 ) and tested among only those teams whether dominated teams were more successful than non - dominated teams . within this subset of teams ,",
    "dominated teams had significantly higher @xmath1 than non - dominated teams ( mann - whitney u test with continuity correction , @xmath48 ) .",
    "the mann - whitney u test ( mwu ) is non - parametric , using ranks of ( in this case ) @xmath1 to mitigate the effects of skewed data , and does not assume normality .",
    "we conclude from this that external contributions do not fully explain the relationship between workload focus and team success .",
    "next , we moved beyond the effects of the heaviest contributor by performing the following analysis .",
    "for each team we computed its * effective * team size @xmath13 , directly accounting for the skew in workload ( see methods for full details ) .",
    "this effective size can be roughly thought of as the average number of unique contributors per unit time and need not be a whole number .",
    "for example , a team of size @xmath49 where both members contribute equally will have effective size @xmath50 , but if one member is responsible for 95% of the work the team would have @xmath51 .",
    "note that @xmath2 and @xmath13 are positively correlated ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : teamsarefocused]c shows that ( i ) all teams are effectively much smaller than their total size would indicate , for all sizes @xmath53 , and ( ii ) top teams are significantly smaller in effective size ( and therefore more focused in their work distribution ) than average or bottom teams with the same @xmath2 .",
    "further , success is significantly , negatively correlated with @xmath13 , for all @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : teamsarefocused]d ) .",
    "more focused teams have significantly more success than less focused teams of the same size , regardless of total team size .     performed by the @xmath54-th most active member , where @xmath3 is the total work of the team , for different size teams .",
    "larger teams perform more work overall , but the majority of work is always done by a small subset of the @xmath2 members ( note the logarithmic axis ) .",
    "inset : the fraction of work performed by the most active team member is always high , often larger than half the total . the dashed line indicates the lower bound of uniform work distribution , @xmath55 .",
    "a team is * dominated * when the most active member does more work than all other members combined .",
    "top teams are significantly more likely to be dominated than either average teams or bottom teams for all @xmath56 .",
    "( _ top team _ : above the 90th percentile in @xmath1 ; _ average team _ : greater than the 40th percentile of @xmath1 and less than or equal to the 60th percentile of @xmath1 ; _ bottom team _ : at or below the 10th percentile of @xmath1 . )",
    "the effective team size @xmath13 ( see methods ) , a measure that accounts for the skewed distribution of work in panel a , is significantly smaller than @xmath2",
    ". moreover , top teams are significantly more focused , having smaller effective sizes , than average or bottom teams at all sizes @xmath53 .",
    "this includes the case @xmath49 , which did not show a significant difference in panel b. the dashed line denotes the upper bound @xmath18 .",
    "success is universally higher for teams with smaller @xmath57 , independent of @xmath2 , further supporting the importance of focused workloads .",
    "the solid lines indicates the average trend for all teams @xmath58 .",
    "these results are not due to outliers in @xmath1 ; see .",
    "[ fig : teamsarefocused ] ]    further analyses revealed the importance of team composition and its role in team success .",
    "team members do not perform their work in a vacuum , they each bring experiences from their other work .",
    "often members of a team will work on other projects .",
    "we investigated these facets of a team s composition by exploring ( i ) how many projects the team s members have worked on , ( ii ) how diverse are the other projects ( do the team members have many or few other projects in common ) , and ( iii ) how many team members were `` leads '' of other projects .",
    "an estimate of experience , @xmath22 , the average number of other projects that team members have worked on ( see methods ) , was significantly related to success . however , the trend was not particularly strong ( see ) and , as we later show via combined modeling efforts , this relationship with success was entirely explainable by the teams other measurable quantities",
    ".    it may be that the volume of experience does not contribute much to the success of a team , but this seems to contradict previous studies on the importance of experience and wisdom  @xcite . to investigate , we turned to a different facet of a team s composition , the diversity of the team s background .",
    "successful teams may tend to be comprised of members who have frequently worked together on the same projects in the past , perhaps developing an experiential shorthand .",
    "conversely , successful teams may instead have multiple distinct viewpoints , solving challenges with a multi - disciplinary perspective  @xcite .    to estimate the distinctness of team member backgrounds , the diversity @xmath24 was measured as the fraction of projects that team members have worked on that are unique ( see methods ) .",
    "diversity is low when all @xmath2 members have worked on the same projects together ( @xmath59 ) , but @xmath24 grows closer to @xmath60 as their backgrounds become increasingly diverse .",
    "a high team diversity was significantly correlated with success , regardless of team size ( fig .",
    "[ fig : teamcomposition ] ) .",
    "even small teams seem to have benefited greatly from diversity : high-@xmath24 duos averaged nearly * eight times * the success of low-@xmath24 duos .",
    "the relationship between @xmath24 and @xmath1 was even stronger for larger teams ( fig .",
    "[ fig : teamcomposition ] inset ) , implying that larger teams can more effectively translate this diversity into success .",
    "even if the raw volume of experience a team has does not play a significant role in the team s success , the diversity of that experience was significantly correlated with team success .",
    "see also our combined modeling efforts .",
    "considerable attention has been paid recently to collective leadership , where decision - making structures emerge from the mass of the group instead of being imposed via a top - down hierarchy  @xcite .",
    "the open collaborations studied here have the potential to display collective leadership due to their volunteer - driven , self - organized nature .",
    "the heaviest contributor to a team is most likely to occupy such a leadership role .",
    "further , since teams overlap , a secondary member of one team may be the `` lead , '' or heaviest contributor to another .",
    "this poses an interesting question : even though teams are heavily focused , are teams more successful when they contain many leads , or few ?",
    "a team with many leads will bring considerable experience , but most of its members may also be unable to dedicate their full attention to the team .    to answer this ,",
    "we measured @xmath35 , the number of team members who are the lead of at least one project ( @xmath61 , see methods ) , and found that teams with many leads have significantly higher success than teams _ of the same size _ with fewer leads ( fig .",
    "[ fig : teamshaveleads ] ) .",
    "only one team member can be the primary contributor to the team , so a team can only have many leads if the other members have focused their work activity on other projects .",
    "team members that are focused on other projects can potentially only provide limited support , yet successful teams tend to arrange their members in exactly this fashion .",
    "of course , the strong focus in work activity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : teamsarefocused ] ) is likely interrelated with these observations .",
    "however , we will soon show that both remain significantly related to success in combined models .",
    "were removed as before .",
    "[ fig : teamshaveleads ] ]    expanding on this observation , table  [ tbl : teamsizeleadsimpact ] illustrates the extreme case of teams of size @xmath2 with a single lead ( @xmath62 ) compared with teams of the same size comprised entirely of leads ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "the latter always displayed significantly higher success than the former ( mwu test , see table ) , independent of team size , underscoring the correlations displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : teamshaveleads ] .",
    "often the difference was massive : teams of size @xmath64 , for example , averaged more than 1200% higher success when @xmath65 than when @xmath62 .",
    ".teams composed entirely of leads ( @xmath63 ) are significantly more successful ( mwu test on @xmath1 ) than teams of the same size with one lead ( @xmath62 ) , regardless of team size @xmath2.teams above the 99th percentile in @xmath1 were excluded to ensure the differences were not due to outliers .",
    "[ tbl : teamsizeleadsimpact ] [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     examining the regression coefficients showed that the number of leads @xmath35 was the variable most strongly correlated with team success .",
    "team age @xmath66 , effective team size @xmath13 , and team size @xmath2 play the strongest roles after @xmath35 in team success , and all three were also significant in the presence of the other variables .",
    "the coefficient on @xmath13 was negative while for @xmath2 it was positive , further underscoring our result that , while teams should be big , they effectively should be small .",
    "next , the diversity @xmath24 of the team , followed by the total work @xmath3 done on the project , were also significant measures related to success . finally , overall team experience @xmath22 was not significant in this model ( @xmath67 ) . we conclude that , while @xmath1 and @xmath22 are correlated by themselves , any effects of @xmath22 are explained by the other quantities .    what about secondary contributions , those activities made by individuals outside the primary team ?",
    "we already performed one test showing that dominated teams are more successful than non - dominated teams even when there are no secondary contributions .",
    "continuing along these lines , we augmented this linear model with two more dependent variables , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "regressing on this expanded model ( see for details ) did not change the significance of any coefficients at the @xmath68 level ; @xmath22 remained insignificant ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "both new variables were significant ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "note that there were no multicollinearity effects in either regression model ( condition numbers < 10 ) .",
    "we conclude that secondary contributions can not alone explain the observations relating team focus , experience , and lead number to team success .",
    "there has been considerable debate concerning the benefits of specialization compared to diversity in the workplace and other sectors  @xcite .",
    "our discoveries here show that a high - success team forms a diverse support system for a specialist core , indicating that both specialization and diversity contribute to innovation and success .",
    "team members should be both specialists , acting as the lead contributor to a team , and generalists , offering ancillary support for teams led by another member .",
    "this has implications when organizations are designing teams and wish to maximize their success , at least as success was measured in these data .",
    "teams tend to do best on average when they maximize @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : introtodata]b ) while minimizing @xmath13 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : teamsarefocused]d ) and maximizing @xmath24 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : teamcomposition ] ) and @xmath35 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : teamshaveleads ] ) .    of course , some tasks are too large for a single person or small team to handle , necessitating the need for mega - teams of hundreds or even thousands of members .",
    "our results imply that such teams may be most effective when broken down into large numbers of small , overlapping groups , where all individuals belong to a few teams and are the lead of at least one .",
    "doing so will help maximize the experiential diversity of each sub - team , while ensuring each team has someone `` in charge '' .",
    "an important open question is what are the best ways to design such pervasively overlapping groups  @xcite , a task that may be project- or domain - specific but which is worth further exploration .",
    "the negative relationship between effective team size @xmath13 and success @xmath1 ( as well as the significantly higher presence of dominated teams among high success teams ) further belies the myth of multitasking  @xcite and supports the `` surgical team '' arguments of brooks  @xcite .",
    "focused work activity , often by even a single person , is a hallmark of successful teams .",
    "this focus both limits the cognitive costs of task switching , and lowers communication and coordination barriers , since so much work is being accomplished by one or only a few individuals .",
    "we have provided statistical tests demonstrating that the relationship between focus and success can not be due to secondary / external team contributions alone .",
    "work focus could possibly be explained by * social loafing * where individual members of a group contribute less effort as part of the group than they would alone , yet loafing does not explain the correlation between , e.g. , leads and success ( fig .",
    "[ fig : teamshaveleads ] ) .",
    "likewise , our team composition results on group experience , experiential diversity , and the number of leads can not be easily explained as a confound with success or secondary contributions : they study specific features of the individuals who comprise a team , those features are not related to the successes of other projects an individual may work on , and they strictly control for total team size @xmath2 ( except for the number of leads @xmath35 , so for that measure we only compared teams with the same @xmath2 ) .",
    "the measures we used for external team contributions , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , may be considered measures of success themselves , and studying or even predicting their levels from team features may prove a fruitful avenue of future work .",
    "lastly , there are two remaining caveats worth mentioning",
    ". we do not specifically control for automatically mirrored repositories ( where a computer script copies updates to github ) . accurately detecting such projects at scale",
    "is a challenge beyond the scope of this work .",
    "however , we expect most will either be filtered out by our existing selection criteria or else they will likely only have a single ( automated ) user that only does the copying .",
    "the second concern is work done outside of github or , more generally , mismatched assignments between usernames and their work .",
    "this is also challenging to fully address ( one issue is that the underlying git repository system does not authenticate users ) .",
    "we acknowledge this concern for our workload focus results , but even it can not explain the significant trends we observed on team composition such as the density of leads .",
    "noise due to improperly recorded or `` out - of - band '' work has in principle affected all quantitative studies of online software repositories .",

    "<S> while larger teams tend to be more successful , workload is highly focused across the team , with only a few members performing most work . </S>",
    "<S> we find that highly successful teams are significantly more focused than average teams of the same size , that their members have worked on more diverse sets of projects , and the members of highly successful teams are more likely to be core members or ` leads ' of other teams . </S>",
    "<S> the relations between team success and size , focus and especially team experience can not be explained by confounding factors such as team age , external contributions from non - team members , nor by group mechanisms such as social loafing . taken together , these features point to organizational principles that may maximize the success of collaborative endeavors . </S>"
