    "quantum information theory has developed dramatically over the past few years , driven by the prospects of quantum - enhanced communication , measurements and computation systems .",
    "most of these concepts were initially developed for discrete quantum variables , in particular quantum bits , which have become the symbol of quantum information theory .",
    "recently , however , much attention has been devoted to investigating the use of continuous variables ( cv ) in quantum information processing .",
    "continuous - spectrum quantum variables may be easier to manipulate than quantum bits in order to perform various quantum information processes @xcite .",
    "this is the case of gaussian state of light , _",
    "e.g. _ squeezed beams , by means of linear optical circuits @xcite . using",
    "cv one may carry out quantum teleportation @xcite and quantum error correction .",
    "the concepts of quantum cloning and entanglement purification @xcite have also been extended to cv , and secure quantum communication protocols have been proposed @xcite .",
    "the key ingredients of quantum information is entanglement , which has become the essential resource for quantum computing , teleportation , and cryptographic protocols .",
    "recently , entanglement has been proved as a valuable resource for improving optical resolution @xcite , spectroscopy @xcite , quantum interferometry @xcite , and has shown to be a crucial ingredient for making the tomography of a quantum device @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we review some applications of cv entangled states to improve quantum measurements @xcite and communication in the optical implementation of quantum information processing . in section [ s : meas ] we analyze the estimation of a displacing amplitude , also in presence of noise , and the case of binary discrimination between two unitary operations . in section [",

    "] , a secret key quantum criptographic scheme based on entangled twin beam and heterodyne detection is analyzed and shown to be effective both for binary quantum key distribution and as complex alphabet trasmission channel .",
    "finally , in section [ s : dent ] we study the evolution of entangled twin - beam of light in a pair of active optical fibers , in order to evaluate the degradation rate of entanglement and determine a threshold value for the interaction time , above which the state become separable .",
    "section [ s : outro ] closes the paper summarizing results .",
    "the measurement problem we are going to consider is the following : suppose one is given a quantum device , which perform an unknown unitary transformation chosen from a given set , and wants to discriminate which transformation ( within the set ) has been actually performed .",
    "the unitaries are labelled by a parameter , such that the discrimination is equivalent to the estimation of the value of the parameter .",
    "the inference strategy is that of preparing an input probe state and then measuring the outgoing signal , such to discriminate among the possible output states . in order to achieve the most accurate discrimination one has to optimize over the possible input signals and the possible output detection schemes .",
    "the question we want to answer is whether or not entanglement is convenient in such discrimination , _",
    "i.e. _ if it is better to use single - mode probe , or to place the device such to act on a subsystem of a bipartite entangled systems , and then allowing for a measurement on both the modes . in the following",
    "we consider the estimation of a displacing amplitude , also in presence of noise , and the case of binary discrimination , _",
    "i.e. _ when our device may perform a transformation chosen from a binary set \\{@xmath0 .",
    "let us consider the problem of estimating the amplitude of a displacement applied to a mode of the radiation field in the phase space , i. e. the parameter @xmath1 of the transformation @xmath2 , where @xmath3 .",
    "this transformation can be easily accomplished by a high trasmittivity beam splitter and an intense laser beam . for unentangled @xmath4 ,",
    "the estimation of @xmath5 isotropic on the complex plane is equivalent to the optimal joint measurement of position and momentum , which , as well known , is affected by a unavoidable minimum noise of 3db @xcite . here",
    ", the optimal state ( for fixed minimum energy ) is the vacuum , and the corresponding conditional probability of measuring @xmath6 given @xmath5 is @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "now , consider the case in which the estimation is made with @xmath8 acting on the entangled state @xmath9 ( without loss of generality we may assume @xmath10 as real ) and number of photons given by @xmath11 . in this case , the optimal measurement is described by the povm @xmath12 of eigenvectors @xmath13 ( @xmath14 may be either @xmath15 or @xmath16 ) of @xmath17 with eigenvalue @xmath6 ( this is just a heterodyne measurement ) , now achieving @xmath18 $ ] , with variance @xmath19 that , in principle , can be decreased at will with the state @xmath20 approaching a state an eigenstate of @xmath21 ( by increasing the gain of the downconverter ) .    remarkably , measurement strategies employing entanglement are robust against decoherence induced by noise , _",
    "i.e. _ they remain convenient also when the estimation is performed with the channel , before and after the unknown transformation , affected by noise .",
    "let us reconsider the problem of estimating the displacement in the case of gaussian noise , which maps states as follows @xmath22 d(\\gamma)\\rho d^\\dag(\\gamma)$ ] .",
    "the variance @xmath23 of the noise is usually referred to as `` mean thermal photon number '' .",
    "the case of gaussian noise is simple , since one has the composition law @xmath24 , and @xmath25= d(\\alpha)\\gamma_{\\overline{n}}(\\rho ) d^\\dag(\\alpha)$ ] .",
    "therefore , if the measurement is made on the entangled state @xmath20 one can easily derive a gaussian probability distribution with variance @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the total gaussian noise before and after the displacement @xmath8 , and the noise is doubled since it acts indenpently on the two entangled beams .",
    "on the other hand , in the measurement scheme with unentangled input ( remind that the optimal probe is the vacuum ) , one has @xmath28 .",
    "one concludes that the entangled input is no longer convenient if @xmath29 , _ i.e. _ above one thermal photon @xmath30 of noise .",
    "this is exactly the threshold of noise above which the entanglement is totally degraded to a separable state @xcite , and therefore the quantum capacity of the noisy channel vanishes .",
    "since at optical frequencies @xmath31 is a small quantity we conclude that entanglement is convenient also in presence of decoherence induced by noise .",
    "let us suppose that we have to distinguish among two unitaries @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "given an input state @xmath34 , one optimizes over the possible measurements , and the minimum error probability in discriminating @xmath35 and @xmath35 @xcite is given , in a bayesian approach , by @xmath36\\;,\\label{pe}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that one has to minimize the overlap @xmath37 with a suitable choice of @xmath34 .",
    "chosing as a basis the eigenvectors @xmath38 of @xmath39 , and writing @xmath40 , we define @xmath41 , where @xmath42 are the eigenvalues of @xmath39 .",
    "the normalization condition for @xmath34 is @xmath43 , so that the subset @xmath44 described by @xmath45 for varying @xmath34 is the convex polygon having the points @xmath46 as vertices .",
    "the minimum overlap @xmath47 is the distance of @xmath48 from @xmath49 .",
    "this geometrical picture indicates in a simple way what is the best one can do in discriminating @xmath32 and @xmath33 : if @xmath50 contains the origin then the two unitaries can be exactly discriminated , otherwise one has to find the point of @xmath50 nearest to the origin , and the minimum probability of error is related to its distance from the origin @xcite .",
    "once the optimal point in @xmath50 is found , the optimal states @xmath51 are those corresponding to that point through the expression of @xmath52 . if @xmath53 is the angular spread of the eigenvalues of @xmath39 ( referring to fig.1 , it is @xmath54 ) , from eq .",

    "the answer is at first negative .",
    "in fact , using entanglement translates the problem into the one of distinguishing between @xmath59 and @xmath60 , thus one has to analyze of the polygon @xmath61 .",
    "since @xmath62 has the same eigenvalues as @xmath39 , the polygons @xmath63 and @xmath64 are exactly the same , so that they lead to the same minimum probability of errror .",

    ", it is clear that there will be an @xmath72 such that @xmath73 and @xmath74 will be exactly discriminable , _",
    "i.e. _ entanglement makes possible the exact discrimation of _ any _ pair of unitary transformation .",
    "in this section we want to emphasize the role of entanglement in improving interferometric measurements .",
    "in particular , we show that an optimized two - mode interferometer requires an entangled input state , and that the ultimate scaling may be achieved using feasible cv entangled states ( _ i.e. _ twin - beam ) in a mach - zehnder interferometer .",
    "a general interferometric scheme consists of a source which prepares a state @xmath75 , an intermediate apparatus which may or may not act a perturbation , and a detector described by a generic povm @xmath76 . in a mach - zehnder - like interferometer",
    "the perturbation is described by the unitary operator @xmath77 , where we used the schwinger representation @xmath78=\\pm j_\\pm\\ ; , [ j_+,j_-]=2j_z$ ] in terms of two modes of the interferometer .",
    "the two possible interferometric outputs are thus given by @xmath75 , if no perturbation occurs , and @xmath79 , in case of perturbation .",
    "depending on the outcome of the measurement one decides for the most probable hypothesis on the state of the system .",
    "interferometry is thus equivalent to a binary decision problem , and the corresponding povm is binary , i.e. the possible outcomes are two @xcite .",
    "optimization of both the input signal and the detection scheme has two main goals : i ) to maximize the probability of revealing a perturbation , when it occurs , and ii ) to minimize the value of the smallest perturbation that can be effectively detected .",
    "if @xmath75 and @xmath80 are orthogonal the discrimination is trivial . in general , however , the states are not orthogonal and one has to apply an optimization scheme .",
    "since interferometric schemes are frequently used for detecting low - rate events , we use , rather than bayesian , the so - called neyman - pearson ( np ) detection strategy @xcite , which consists in fixing the false - alarm probability @xmath81the probability of inferring that the state of the system is @xmath80 while it is actually @xmath75and then maximizing the detection probability @xmath82 , i.e. the probability of a correct inference of the state @xmath80 .",
    "the problem is solved by diagonalizing the operator @xmath83 , @xmath84 ( real ) playing the role of a lagrange multiplier accounting for the bound of fixed false alarm probability .",
    "the optimal povm is the one in which @xmath85 is the projection onto the eigenspaces of @xmath83 relative to positive eigenvalues and @xmath86 . if @xmath87 and @xmath88 are pure states we have @xmath89 ^ 2 $ ]",
    "( if @xmath90 , @xmath82=1 , otherwise ) where @xmath91 one is forced to decrease the detection probability in order to keep the false alarm probability small .    after having determined the optimal povm , _ i.e. _ the optimal detection scheme , the whole setup can be furtherly optimized looking for the best input state , that is a state for which @xmath92 assumes its minimum value @xmath93 .",
    "as we saw in section 2.2 , the value @xmath93 depends on the eigenvalues of the unitary operator @xmath94 .",
    "since the spectrum of @xmath95 is the set of relative integers , the spectrum of @xmath94 is the discrete subset @xmath96 of the unit circle in the complex plane .",
    "apart from the null measure set @xmath97 of values of @xmath98 , the spectrum of @xmath94 is dense in the unit circle and its convex hull contains the origin of the complex plane , although there is no couple of diametrically opposed eigenvalues . if @xmath99 then the optimal state is given by a superposition of two eigenstates of @xmath100 with eigenvalues differing by a factor @xmath101 @xcite . in the general case ,",
    "the optimal state is any superposition of three or more eigenstates of @xmath102 , such that the polygon with vertices on their eigenvalues encloses the origin of the complex plane . since @xmath103 with @xmath104 , the eigenvectors of @xmath94 are entangled .",
    "in fact they are obtained from the eigenstates of @xmath105 ( nonclassical states ) by the beam - splitter - like transformation @xmath106 @xcite .",
    "actually , these optimal states are far from being practically realizable .",
    "however , we have proved that they are entangled , and this suggests to explore the possibility of performing a reliable discrimination by physically realizable entangled states , e.g. twin - beams @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "the overlap for the probe prepared in a twin - beam state is given by @xmath108 .",
    "after minor algebra we get @xmath109^{-1}\\:.\\ ] ] this value is not zero but it can be arbitrarily small depending on the mean photon number of the input state .",
    "the sensitivity of the interferometer corresponds to the minimum detectable value @xmath110 , which is the minimum value of @xmath98 such that @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the _ a priori _ probability of the perturbation .",
    "the value of @xmath113 is fixed by the experimenter and is called _ acceptance ratio_. in order to understand its meaning we notice that , if the setup detects a perturbation , the probability that this inference is true is @xmath114=p \\gamma^*/[p\\gamma^*+(1-p)]$ ] .",
    "therefore , the greater is @xmath113 , the nearer is this probability to one . in terms of @xmath115",
    "the condition @xmath111 reads as @xmath116 with @xmath117 $ ] where @xmath118 parametrically depends on @xmath98 .",
    "accordingly , the minimum detectable @xmath98 is given by @xmath119 now , we consider twin - beam as input signal of the usual mach - zehnder interferometer , where the detection stage consists of a difference photocurrent measurement",
    ". the scheme should be feasible , at least in principle , and , as we will see , would approach the ultimate sensitivity bound that has been obtained for the ideal detection .",
    "after preparation , the twin - beam enters the interferometer , where is possibly subjected to the action of the unitary @xmath94 . at the output",
    "the two beams are detected and the difference photocurrent @xmath120 is measured . if no perturbation occurs , then the output state is still a twin - beam , and since @xmath107 is an eigenstate of @xmath121 with zero eigenvalue we have a constant zero outcome for the difference photocurrent . on the other hand ,",
    "when a perturbation occurs the output state is no longer an eigenstate of @xmath121 , and we detect fluctuations which reveals the perturbation . the false - alarm and the detection probabilities are given by @xmath122 and @xmath123 , where the probability of observing zero counts at the output , after the action of @xmath94 , is given by @xmath124 since the eigenvalue @xmath125 is degenerate .",
    "in this case the false - alarm probability is zero and therefore it is not necessary to introduce an acceptance ratio .",
    "the scaling of the minimum detectable perturbation can be obtained directly in term of the detection probability @xmath126 one can see that a mach - zehnder interferometer fed by twin - beam shows a sensitivity that scales with the energy as the ideal scheme . such scaling does not depend on any parameter but the energy of the input state .",
    "this should be compared with the sensitivity of the customary squeezed states interferometry @xcite , where the same scaling is achieved only for a very precise tuning of the phase of the squeezing .",
    "this means that the entanglement - assisted interferometry provides a more stable and reliable scheme .",
    "in this section , a secret key quantum criptographic scheme based on entangled twin beam and heterodyne detection is analyzed .",
    "the scheme can be effectively employed both for binary quantum key distribution and as complex alphabet trasmission channel , and the use of entangled signals results in a decrease of the error probability .",
    "a quantum encoding of the secret - key in a cryptographic communication is motivated by the possibility of achieving extensive key - expansion , due to the physical limitations in a quantum - measurement based eavsdropping .",
    "such an idea for a quantum secret - key cryptographic communication was first suggested by yuen @xcite .",
    "the secret key is imposed as a random displacement transformation , such that the scheme is secure in principle , _",
    "i.e. _ the best strategy for an eavsdropper is just pure guess .",
    "effects of practical imperfections will be taken into account .",
    "the two value of the bit are encoded in two _",
    "quasi_-eigenstates of the heterodyne photocurrent @xmath17 , _",
    "i.e. _ as @xmath127 and @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the twin - beam .",
    "the @xmath129 s ( and thus the @xmath130 s ) become orthogonal states for @xmath131 .",
    "we will use the notation @xmath132 , @xmath133 .",
    "the criptographic protocol consists in applying a random displacement transformation @xmath8 to the bit _ before _ the transmission .",
    "the value of @xmath5 represents the key that should be secretely shared before the transmission .",
    "the receiver ( bob ) knows the key , and therefore can apply the inverse transformation @xmath134 at the end of the line and then measure the bit . for this task",
    "he has to measure a two - value povm @xmath135 .",
    "the two states are not orthogonal , and therefore such a povm should be optimized to achieve the minimum error probability @xmath136= \\frac12 [ 1-\\sum_i u(\\lambda_i ) \\lambda_i]$ ] , where @xmath137 are the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath138 , and @xmath139 denotes the heaviside step function .",
    "since the two initial states @xmath140 are pure the solution is well known : the povm is projective @xcite ( this is true also for mixed @xmath141 s ) and the error probability is given by @xmath142 $ ] , where @xmath143 .",
    "for large @xmath69 or @xmath144 we have @xmath145 .",
    "this result should be compared with the analogue scheme based on displaced unentangled states _",

    ", entanglement is always convenient to improve precision of the transmission channel .",
    "let s go back to the entangled scheme : an eavsdropper , say eve , does not know the key , and therefore , to measure the bit , she has ( in principle ) to discriminate between the two mixed states @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "since the set of displacement operators is a uir of a group we have , according to schur lemma , @xmath156 1 = 0 $ ] , and therefore @xmath157 _ i.e. _ the best strategy for eve is just pure guess .    in practice , however , it is not possible to impose displacements with uniform probability in the complex plane .",
    "what we can reliably implement is the following criptographic protocol ( random state transformation ) @xmath158 where @xmath159 is a gaussian distribution , and to find the error probability for eve , we have to diagonalize @xmath160 . in order to prove that the present protocol is secure we have to compare the best stratey employable by eve with a feasible strategy that bob can use .",
