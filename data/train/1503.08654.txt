    "<S> the experimental data deviate from a purely rmt - based prediction , while they exhibit better agreement with a semiclassical expression that factors out the number of instantaneous decay modes . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the latter estimate depends on the lyapunov exponent of the chaotic dynamics , and it accounts for a characteristic tail in the decay of the number of regular modes , which we interpret as a signature of the ballistic escape of the rays into the absorber , occurring within ehrenfest time .    </S>",
    "<S> although the theoretical analysis does not take into account either partial transport barriers  @xcite , or the `` sticky '' dynamics at the regular - chaotic border  @xcite , which all cause long - time correlations to decay algebraically rather than exponentially , we argue in what follows that the current model is suitable for the resolution of our experiment . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ figurefive ] illustrates the survival probability in the chaotic region , obtained from extensive ray - dynamics simulations of the microcavity - shaped billiard : despite an overall power - law decay , a closer look at the short - time dynamics reveals that the decay is initially exponential , behavior known as transient chaos  @xcite .    the estimates for the dwelling time @xmath102 , and the fitted value from the data of @xmath25 , maximum decay rate of the chaotic resonances , are both within the timescale of exponential decay . that suggests that the suppression by the absorber of the longest - lived resonances ( that scale algebraically with @xmath25 @xcite ) alone does not affect the number of excited wgms measured in the experiment , and therefore is not detected by the current apparatus .     of a ray in the microcavity vs. @xmath103 ( in units of poincar time ) at @xmath104 , from @xmath105 randomly - started trajectories </S>",
