    "the search for neutrino - less double decay , @xmath1 , decay is a major challenge of to - day s neutrino physics .",
    "the process , if found , will prove unambigously the majorana nature of neutrino .",
    "it will also provide a sensitive measure of the neutrino mass .",
    "nuclear physics , with the studies of @xmath1 transitions is expected to resolve this question for the electron neutrino , @xmath2 .",
    "if it is a majorana particle then by definition it is identical to its charge conjugate .",
    "thus the neutrino produced in a weak process on one nucleon may be absorbed by another nucleon .",
    "the outcome is a nuclear reaction @xmath3 amplitudes for such a process are proportional to the majorana neutrino mass . for the description of the problems",
    "involved we refer to reviews @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the experimental check of transition ( [ 1 ] ) requires detection of two correlated electrons of a given total energy .",
    "such measurements are difficult not only because of low rates and the dominating random background , but also as a result of the high physical background .",
    "the latter is due to the neutrino accompanied double beta process @xmath4 .",
    "some of these difficulties may be overcome by studying the inverse process of neutrino - less double electron capture accompanied by a photon emission @xcite , @xcite .",
    "there are several experimental advantages .",
    "the monoenergetic photon provides a convenient experimental signature .",
    "other advantages include the favourable ratio of the @xmath5 to the competing @xmath6 capture rates as opposed to that of @xmath7 to @xmath8 .",
    "this point is discussed in detail below .",
    "another important advantage of the @xmath5 process is the existence of the coincidence trigger to suppress the random background .",
    "these advantages offset , in part , the longer lifetimes for the @xmath5 decays .",
    "chances for the capture process have been calculated in ref.@xcite . the seemingly most likely process , which involves two @xmath9 electrons and leads to two @xmath9 holes in the final atom , does not conserve spin . allowed is the capture of @xmath10 electron pair with the photon emitted by one of these electrons in intermediate states . the rate increases roughly with @xmath11 , high z atoms are thus required .",
    "still , the experiments would be difficult .",
    "there is yet another process which may be more likely at small energy release .",
    "this involves the virtual captures of @xmath12 electrons and the radiation process in the final excited atom .",
    "a resonance enhancement of the capture rates is predicted @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , when the energy release @xmath13 is comparable to the @xmath14 atomic level difference .",
    "away from the resonance the rates depend only slowly on @xmath13 , in strong contrast with the @xmath7 decays .",
    "this makes studies of decays to excited states in final nuclei feasible , thus enhancing chances of locating the resonances .",
    "candidates for such studies have been considered @xcite , @xcite , and the experimental feasibility is found encouraging,@xcite .",
    "this paper consists of two sections .",
    "section ii gives a brief presentation of two basic radiation mechanisms that occur in the @xmath5 transitions .",
    "in section iii the physical background for these two modes is calculated .",
    "the rate @xmath15 for the neutrino - less double beta decay may be factorised into nuclear and leptonic parts ( see e.g. @xcite,@xcite , @xcite ) @xmath16 this equation involves nuclear matrix elements @xmath17 , the leptonic contributions including final state electron wave functions and final phase space elements are contained in @xmath18 .",
    "the neutrino mass factor @xmath19 reflects the chance for the left handed neutrino emitted from one nucleon to have the righ - handed component required for the subsequent absorption on another nucleon .",
    "the reverse process of double electron capture @xmath20 is not allowed by the energy - momentum conservation , emission of a third body is necessary . in the following we consider the photon emission to fulfill this requirement : @xmath21 again",
    ", the capture rate may be factorised into the nuclear , leptonic and photonic terms @xmath22 ^ 2    \\mid m^{\\gamma}(q ) \\mid^2\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the photon energy given by the mass difference of the initial and final atoms reduced by the energies of two electron holes left in the final state .",
    "the factors involved in eq.([a4 ] ) differ from those of eq.([a1 ] ) by the final phase space , the transition energy and electron wave functions .",
    "the nuclear transition element is of similar nature though it connects different nuclei .",
    "it is given by the terms in brackets which describe the propagation of neutrino between two nucleons .",
    "these contain the neutrino mass and the nuclear matrix element of `` neutrino exchange potential '' .",
    "for the dominant gamow - teller transitions the latter is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the distance between the two nucleons and @xmath25 is the average energy needed to generate neutrino of very short propagation range .",
    "calculations yield @xmath26 , @xcite,@xcite .",
    "an additional factor @xmath27 introduced into eq.([a4 ] ) denotes the probability of photon emission .",
    "two cases are likely to offer a good chance for the experimental detection .",
    "the first one occurs when an electron from @xmath28 or @xmath9 state radiates before it is captured by the nucleus . in this case",
    ", @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the electron charge and @xmath31 is the photon wave normalisation .",
    "the first term gives the order of magnitude estimate .",
    "finer calculations based on glauber - martin @xcite,@xcite , theory for the electron radiating in the coulomb field give the corrective factor @xmath32 for the magnetic transition that takes place in these circumstances , @xcite,@xcite .    the second mode of radiative transitions comes from a different scenario , indicated in figure 1 .",
    "two @xmath9 electrons may be captured in a virtual process which generates a final atom with two @xmath9 electron holes .",
    "this final atom radiates and one of the holes is filled .",
    "that is a resonant - like situation and close to the resonance @xmath33 ^ 2 + [ \\gamma^r/2 ] ^2 } \\frac { \\pi}{q^2}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the radiative width of the final two - electron - hole atom .",
    "there are a number of resonant situations .",
    "the most important one happens with @xmath35 that is when the @xmath5 transition energy @xmath13 coincides with the @xmath14 electric radiative transition in the final nucleus ( the @xmath36 transition indicated in eq.[a6 ] ) .",
    "these resonant situations may greatly enhance the rate .",
    "practical interest requires @xmath37 kev .",
    "there are several targets likely to fulfill this condition , @xcite,@xcite .",
    "assuming the photon energy resolution to be @xmath38 we calculate now the ratio of the signal from the @xmath39 to the physical background due to the @xmath40 transitions in the double electron capture .",
    "this ratio is defined as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the fraction of photons from the dominant @xmath40 decay mode emitted into the region from the end of the spectrum @xmath13 down to @xmath43 .",
    "for the two neutrino process the radiative rate is @xmath44 where the nuclear matrix element @xmath45 differs from @xmath46 . for the gamow - teller transitions one has @xmath47 , and calculations , @xcite , @xcite , yield @xmath48 .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath45 for the neutrino and @xmath46 for the neutrino - less decays are almost energy independent .",
    "the leptonic factor @xmath49 is also constant as opposed to the equivalent factor in the double @xmath50 decays .",
    "the required ratio @xmath51 is thus given by the phase space .",
    "let us present eq.([b2 ] ) as an integral over the photon energy distribution @xmath52 : @xmath53 the background contribution follows as @xmath54 > from eq.([b2 ] ) one obtains @xmath55    first we consider the magnetic type transition related to the @xmath10 electron capture . in this case",
    "@xmath27 given by eq.([a4 ] ) is constant and the ratio of total rates becomes : @xmath56 which gives the relative frequency of the non - neutrino to the corresponding two - neutrino radiative transitions . for characteristic values",
    "@xmath57 mev and @xmath58 ev one obtains @xmath59 .",
    "the contribution from the physical background to the region of the monoenergetic photon depends on the energy resolution : @xmath60 for @xmath57 mev , @xmath61 ev and @xmath62 kev one obtains very low background @xmath63 .",
    "now we turn to the case of the resonant electron captures .",
    "the rate of the signal to the background depends strongly on the relation of the transition energy to the resonance energy .",
    "assume that the situation of a nearby resonance is materialised with @xmath64 , that is the resonance transition is located within the photon spectrum .",
    "also , we assume the line to be within the photon energy resolution band @xmath65 .",
    "we exclude for a moment the optimal but highly unlikely situation of @xmath66 corresponding to the line coinciding with the end of the photon spectrum . with these limitations one obtains @xmath67 ^ 3   \\mid m^{2\\nu}\\mid ^2 } \\frac { \\gamma^r ( 2p \\rightarrow 1s ) } { [ q- q_{res}]^2 + [ \\gamma^r/2 ] ^2}.\\ ] ] beyond the range of natural widths ( @xmath68 kev )",
    "the ratio @xmath69 falls down as @xmath70^{-5}$ ] . for @xmath71",
    "kev the signal to background rate is still very convenient @xmath72 . however , the conditions deteriorate quickly with the increasing separation .",
    "formula ( [ b8 ] ) is valid for @xmath73 .",
    "the other two situations , i.e. that of @xmath74 when the centre of the atomic line is beyond the photon spectrum , or that of a `` direct hit '' into the line , @xmath75 , offer the luxurious ratio @xmath76 , which means no physical background .",
