    "<S> formal similarity between @xmath0 area for the contribution from zr - states and the remnant fermi surface has been found . </S>",
    "<S> presence of the contribution from @xmath1 states at other @xmath0 area means the two - channel processes of scattering . as consequence , the method of integration with a constant energy interval </S>",
    "<S> reproduces not only remnant fermi surface at least , but one of the contributions of above states to the total spectral intensity    oxychlorides @xmath2 and @xmath3 are antiferromagnetic insulators with neel temperatures of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral intensity in angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) of  the oxychlorides gives the information about the nature of a single hole in @xmath6 - plane . here , we are interested the only the low - energy exitations or so - called first electron - removal states . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral intensity of the first electron - removal state in the oxychlorides  amplitude quasiparticle peak ( qp ) shows a sudden drop along a line in @xmath7 - space which closely resembles the fermi surface ( fs ) obtained in the band - structure calculation or arpes data of the optimally or overdoped high temperature superconductors ( htscs ) . comparing the binding energies of the first electron - removal states at @xmath7 - wave vectors on the remnant fs one can formally define a gap @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the gap dispersion of the qp peak along @xmath7 - contour of the remnant fs is close to the d- wave- superconductivity gap in the optimal and overdoped htscs , i.e. there is a clear connection between all three energy gaps .    </S>",
    "<S> the recent arpes  </S>",
    "<S> experiments for the oxychlorides have shown that there is a strong dependence of the amplitude of qp on a photon energy matr.eff . </S>",
    "<S> [ 2 ] . for @xmath8 - photon energy@xmath9 </S>",
    "<S> there is the clear qp at @xmath10 . and the amplitudes of peak at @xmath11 and @xmath12 are approximately equal each other . in really , it is a strange behavior of spectral intensity in a vicinity of the remnant fs where we have the right to expect the asymmetry in the amplitudes of qp at these two @xmath7 - points irrespective of the photon energy . </S>",
    "<S> a probable explanation is the matrix element effect in arpes- data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the later , in turn , points out that there is the different nature of the first electron - removal state at the different @xmath7 - wave vectors . </S>",
    "<S> however , according to the generally accepted conclusion , these states have @xmath13 - symmetry of zhang - rice ( zr- ) state on all bz . this statement is coordinated with the polarized arpes  </S>",
    "<S> data @xcite . in </S>",
    "<S> really , we need to classify the valence states according to the small irreducible representations of @xmath14 - group at the specific @xmath7 - point . therefore , the admissible symmetries for the first removal state can be very different with regard for the nature of the partial contribution to the total spectral intensity and @xmath7 - point symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the generalized tight binding ( gtb- ) approach @xcite represents an interesting opportunity to investigate the reasons resulting in the matrix element effects in arpes- spectrum from above wider view .    analyzing arpes - data from the oxychlorides we deal with a charge - transfer insulator @xcite and the appropriate low - energy model </S>",
    "<S> is reduced to the one - band habbard model or extended @xmath15-model only in the special case @xcite . in this case </S>",
    "<S> there is the nondegenerate ground singlet state . in htscs , as believe , the ground state is the zr - state . </S>",
    "<S> the last statement has basically the experimental character @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the theoretical investigations do nt give the unequivocal conclusion about a nature of the ground state in htscs . in the ab - initio works @xcite </S>",
    "<S> it was find that zr - state competes with @xmath16 - triplet state , especially , in the area of the doped htsc - sructures . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations show the triplet level is situated on @xmath17 above @xmath18 - level @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover there is a crossover between the singlet and triplet levels at some parameters of the calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the above magnitudes are approximately equal to a width of the valence bands in htscs and we think , that there is a problem to coordinate theoretical and recent experimental conclusions .    in the works </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we have calculated the dispersion , spectral intensity and parity of quasiparticle states along the high symmetric directions of bz , within the frameworks @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 - five orbital general tight binding ( gtb- ) approach . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations reproduce the partial contributions from out - of - plane states : @xmath20 and @xmath22 in @xmath23 - and @xmath24 - symmetric points of bz , due to a crossing and hybridization of the bands of zr- and @xmath16 - valence states . </S>",
    "<S> it is surprising , that , with regard for the magnitudes of partial contributions , a calculated picture of the spectral intensity and its dependence on the polarization also are coordinated with observed ones @xcite .    in present work </S>",
    "<S> we reproduce the partial contributions from the in - plane and out - of - plane states to the total spectral intensity on all bz and give a probable interpretation for the remnant fs in the oxychlorides as @xmath7 -area for the in - plane contribution only . as well known , zr- states are @xmath13 - symmetrized combination of @xmath25 , @xmath26- in - plane orbitales and , in turn , the triplet states are @xmath16 - symmetrized combination of @xmath27 , @xmath28 , - out - of - plane orbitales on the whole . let s notice also , that the partial contribution from @xmath26 - in - plane orbitales to @xmath16 - triplet states is not zero but is small in the all bz @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we believed that in @xmath29 -area for the basic contribution from the out - of - plane states the dependence of the spectral intensity on the photon energy will arise due to the possible three - dimensional effects ( 3d ) ( i.e. a monotonic @xmath30 -dependence ) . and in @xmath7 - area for the basic contribution from the in - plane states the oscillations of spectral intensity at the different photon energies are possible only @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillations are caused by the diffraction of an photoelectronic wave on the periodic structure of oxychlorides along c - axis . </S>",
    "<S> namely in this mean we have used the term : `` effective dimension '' placed in a title of the work .    </S>",
    "<S> we will start from the recent results obtained at @xmath31 within the framework of gtb- approach where alongside with @xmath18 -state there is the @xmath16 - state in the two - hole sector of gilbert space . </S>",
    "<S> they may are briefly summarized as the following :    - on the top of the valence band of oxychlorides in the antiferromagnetic ( afm- ) phase there is the pseudogap of the magnetic nature : @xmath32 between the virtual level and valence band . </S>",
    "<S> the pseudogap converts into zero at @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the virtual level has the small spectral intensity , proportional to the concentration of the zero spin fluctuations @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the pseudogap disappears in the paramagnetic ( pm- ) phase , where the dispersion of the valence band is similar to the dispersion of the optimally and overdoped htscs @xcite ;    - the valence band of the oxychlorides has no only two - dimensional character , and on bz there are the @xmath7 - areas where the triplet contribution from @xmath20 - orbital of copper and @xmath22 - orbital of the apical ions cl or o is nt precisely equal to zero ;    - the experimental k - dependences of qp - amplitude in the spectral intensity of oxichlorides@xcite are satisfactorily described by the @xmath7 - dependences of the partial contribution to the total spectral density obtained in the framework of gtb- approach . </S>",
    "<S> the feature of these dependencies is the nonzero contribution from triplet states in @xmath23 - and @xmath24 - symmetric points of bz .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , the presence of states with the symmetry of distinct from @xmath18 - symmetry , namely of triplet @xmath16 - states , does not contradict the arpes - data . </S>",
    "<S> further we , with a help of the similar approach , will reproduce separately both the @xmath35 -contribution from the triplet out - of - plane states , and @xmath36 -contribution from the singlet in - plane states on all bz . the details of gtb - approach and magnitudes of parameters can be found in the works @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation was carried out in afm- and pm- phases at t=0k . in fig.1,2(a , b , </S>",
    "<S> c ) the amplitudes of the quasiparticle peak for the partial contributions : @xmath36 and @xmath35 to the total spectral intensity are showed . in fig.1(d ) the dispersion of the quasiparticle peak on all bz is showed and well reproduces one observed in  @xcite . in pm - phase ( fig.2(d ) ) the dispersion is similar to one in doped htscs .    </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1abcd ]    [ fig2abcd ]    we have found , that @xmath36 - partial contribution is distributed along @xmath7 - contour close to the edge of the antiferromagnetic bz ( fig.1(c ) ) in afm - phase . in pm - phase ( fig.2(c ) ) , @xmath37 - contour loses the symmetry and to become more close to one of the remnant fs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we can suppose that it is not simple coincidence provided that the procedure of recovery of fs by integration on the fixed energy interval is insufficient in the considered case .    here , both the dispersion , and spectral intensity are calculated without taking into account the any processes of relaxation . </S>",
    "<S> there is only the phenomenological damping @xmath38  to obtain a lorentzian form of curve of spectral intensity ( fig.3 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ]    specificity of considered materials is that namely the strongly correlated nature of the quasiparticle states in bz result in @xmath7 - dependence of the amplitude of qp . </S>",
    "<S> however , we think the specific singlet - triplet character of the quasiparticle states means also the two - channel relaxation process .    the calculations of an effective speed of relaxation with the account for the strong correlated nature of the quasiparticle states within the framework of the impurity diagram technique @xcite show our diagram [ 13 ] , that in according to matissen s rule @xmath39 - the speed of relaxation is additive function of the contributions with weights @xmath40 and @xmath41 , a sense of which consists in the probability with which the carrier participates in the scattering on the appropriate potential for in - plane and out - of - plane states . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath42 , and @xmath43 depends on the specific character of states and reflects a presence of strong correlations renormalizing the hybridization effects of the states . </S>",
    "<S> the scattering potentials for these groups of states can be different , because their spatial nature is different also . it may be effects nonstoichiometry along the in - plane and apical positions or fluctuations of the magnetic moment in and between @xmath6 - planes . </S>",
    "<S> for example , we can account the nonstoichiometry effects by means of the following arguments . in the @xmath7 - areas for only triplet contribution @xmath44 and @xmath45 , </S>",
    "<S> where @xmath46 - concentration of the scattering centers for carriers in the out - of - plane states . along the @xmath7 -contour of the remnant fs accordingly @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> note also , that at @xmath48 , @xmath49 due to the absence of the scattering in @xmath6 - planes @xmath50 it can be obtained @xmath51 , i.e. the relaxation takes place even at absence of scattering processes in @xmath6 - planes . </S>",
    "<S> thus , crossing from one of @xmath14 - areas bz in another one we should observe the widening or narrowing of the quasiparticle peak in according to relation between @xmath52 and @xmath53 . in the case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath54 the amplitude of qusiparticle peak in @xmath7 -area for the triplet states falls and to collect all intensity the much greater energy interval than in @xmath7 -area for contribution only from the in - plane states is required .    </S>",
    "<S> the two - channel scattering of carriers on the spin fluctuations may be more actual in the oxychlorides . in the experiments using a magnetic neutron scattering , in contrast the classical @xmath55 where a transition to the 3d- bragg peak observed in 2%- interval from @xmath56 , the dynamic scattering in @xmath57 transformed in the three - dimensional one from @xmath58 gradually . even at the high temperatures @xmath59 </S>",
    "<S> @xmath60 the low - energy spin fluctuations in @xmath61 have still @xmath62 character [ 13 ] . </S>",
    "<S> according to empirical conclusions , the lengths of spin correlations are equal to @xmath63  and @xmath64 . at the same temperature </S>",
    "<S> the carrier in the out - of - plane state from @xmath1 symmetrized combination , situated at the more hot spot of bz than the carrier in the in - plane state from @xmath65 symmetrized combination .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , the method of integration with a constant interval is unacceptable at the presence of contributions to the total spectral intensity from so different states . </S>",
    "<S> there is a risk , that the method of the integration used in @xcite does not reproduce in particular not only the remnant fs , but also one of the contributions to the total spectral intensity with least relaxation time . </S>",
    "<S> namely the contribution from @xmath19 - , @xmath66 / @xmath67 - orbitales .    </S>",
    "<S> we think , that as consequence of the scattering processes , the contribution from the triplet states reproduces , in turn , a noncoherent part of the spectral intensity in arpes - spectra of oxychlorides . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the effective dimension of the quasiparticle states can rise up to 3d in the vicinity of @xmath68 - and @xmath24 - symmetric points of bz . in these @xmath69 - areas </S>",
    "<S> we can expect the monotonic dependence of the noncoherent part on the photon energy . </S>",
    "<S> probably , there is also an opportunity to observe not only oscillations of the coherent part as it was made in work @xcite , but oscillations of the relation of the coherent and noncoherent parts of the spectral intensity at the different photon energy .    </S>",
