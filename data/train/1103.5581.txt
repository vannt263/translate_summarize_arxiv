    "nanostructures and nanostructured materials offer the possibility to tune heat transport properties over an exceptionally wide range .",
    "for example in carbon based materials it is possible to obtain variations of the thermal transport coefficients over three orders of magnitude : graphene and suspended carbon nanotubes are possibly the most efficient heat conductors  @xcite , whereas nanotube pellets and graphene nanoribbons with disordered edges are predicted to have thermal insulating properties  @xcite .",
    "similarly , nanostructuring may turn silicon and sige alloys into efficient thermoelectric materials , by significantly reducing the thermal conductivity ( @xmath0 ) as in the case of nanowires  @xcite ( sinw ) , sige nanocomposites  @xcite , superlattices  @xcite , and nanoporous silicon  @xcite .",
    "further improvement in designing materials and nano - devices with controlled thermal transport properties stems from a deeper theoretical understanding of phonon transport . following landauer and bttiker s works  @xcite , atomistic green s function ( gf )",
    "formalism has become the reference method to study coherent electronic transport  @xcite .",
    "the gf approach has been transferred successfully to compute thermal transport in nanostructures  @xcite , and it is the optimal framework to investigate elastic phonon scattering from impurities , defects , disorder or interfaces , i.e. in all those cases where anharmonic phonon - phonon scattering can be deemed of secondary importance  @xcite .",
    "an atomistic gf method including phonon - phonon scattering has also been developed and applied to small model systems  @xcite , however one can in general safely assume elastic scattering when a finite nanoscale system between two reservoirs is considered .",
    "this is generally the case for molecular junctions , contacts and grain boundaries .",
    "special care must be taken in testing this assumption when one wants to extrapolate finite size calculations to extended materials , where long wavelength phonons do not get scattered by nanoscale impurities and contribute a significant amount to the total thermal conductivity . in spite of significant insight achieved in these studies based on the gf formalism",
    ", it remains a formidable task to perform atomistic simulations of nanostructures with characteristic sizes of several tens of nanometers , as it would be needed to bridge the gap between theory and experiment . because of matrix inversion operations , even the recursive implementation of the gf method , which permits us to deal with systems extending for several micrometers in the direction of heat propagation , imposes severe size limitations in the orthogonal plane . in terms of sinw",
    ", this means that one is limited to diameters that do not exceed few nanometers .",
    "similar limitations hamper the predictive power of approaches based on molecular dynamics , so far restrained to the study of thin wires  @xcite .    here",
    "we outline a formalism for phonon transport based on the scattering - matrix approach  @xcite , which circumvents the matrix inversion problem by substituting eigenvalue equations with local kernel search and intersections . after deriving a generalized scattering - matrix approach for phonon propagation",
    ", we illustrate the numerically stable and efficiently parallelizable kernel method .",
    "for example , we apply the scattering formalism to compute the contact thermal resistance between bulk silicon and sinws with diameters up to 14 nm .",
    "the scattering - matrix approach was formulated to solve quantum electronic transmission problems  @xcite , and found its natural application for the simulation of scanning tunneling microscopy images  @xcite and of molecular electronic devices via the so called _ elastic scattering quantum chemistry _ ( esqc ) method  @xcite . here",

    "the first step to compute the eigenstates in [ basis1 ] is to rewrite the eigenvalue problem as a null - space search problem : @xmath36 it is then possible to consider a partition @xmath37 of the system , and to solve locally the auxiliary equations @xmath38 the solutions of the eigenvalue problem are given by the intersection of the resulting invariant subspaces : @xmath39 typically , the partition is a set of projectors on each reservoir , completed by a set of projectors on the defect . the auxiliary equations ( [ auxiliary ] ) for the defect are solved with a qr decomposition method , which is stable and numerically efficient .",
    "the reservoirs are treated in a separate way : as in the propagator method  @xcite , every reservoir is partitioned into periodic slices @xmath40 of dimension @xmath41 such that only nearest neighboring slices interact ( see [ figscheme ] ) .",
    "however , instead of formulating a spatial propagator , we first compute the @xmath42 non - trivial solutions of [ auxiliary ] for the second slice @xmath43 of the reservoir : @xmath44 the periodic solutions are then reconstructed by solving the @xmath45 generalized eigen - problem : @xmath46\\!\\cdot\\ ! \\left[\\begin{array}{c",

    "the intersection of the periodic solutions leads to phonon modes @xmath48 ( @xmath49=1 ) , and surfaces states ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "after intersecting the reservoir and the defect solutions , we extract a basis @xmath51 spanning only surface states localized at the defect interface ( i.e. with @xmath52 ) : @xmath53 the scattering tensor is then computed by applying the @xmath54 transform to the @xmath51 set , providing the set of eigenstates @xmath55 defined in [ basis1 ] , so that : @xmath56 . in the presence of short range interactions ,",
    "parts can be defined to be as small as the interaction range , so that only neighboring parts interact .",
    "such an implementation allows efficient parallelization , in the same fashion as domain decomposition in molecular dynamics codes .",
    "the auxiliary equations are solved locally in parallel before their intersection according to a binomial tree .",
    "furthermore , a reciprocal space sampling technique allows an efficient treatment of the periodic reservoirs solutions . within this framework ,",
    "the main limitation of the approach is the treatment of non - periodic 1d reservoirs , which requires the full diagonalisation of a matrix , which scales as the square of the surface of the contact .",

    "interface resistance plays an essential role in determining the thermal transport performance of nanostructured materials and nanoscale devices .",
    "in addition , evaluating the thermoelectric performances of nanostructures such as sinw , it is indispensable to be able to resolve the contact thermal resistance from the intrinsic resistance .",
