    "collective cell migration@xcite in epithelial tissues is one of the key mechanisms behind many biological processes , such as the development of an embryo,@xcite wound healing,@xcite and tumour metastasis and invasion.@xcite due to their layered , tightly connected structure,@xcite epithelial tissues also serve as an excellent model system to study cell migration processes . over several decades@xcite extensive research efforts",
    "have been devoted to understanding molecular processes that lead to cell migration@xcite and , at larger scales , on how cell migration drives complex processes at the level of the entire tissue , such as morphogenesis . with recent advances in various microscopy techniques combined with the development of sophisticated automatic cell tracking methods",
    ", it is now possible to study collective migration patterns of a large number of cells over extended periods of time with the cell - level resolution , both _ in vitro _ and _ in vivo_. traction force microscopy@xcite experiments revealed that collective cell motion is far more complex than expected.@xcite it is often useful to draw parallels between the collective behaviour of tissues and systems studied in the physics of colloids , granular materials and foams as these can provide powerful tools for understanding complex cell interactions in biological systems .",
    "for example , in a homogenous cell monolayer , one observes large spatial and temporal fluctuations of inter - cellular forces that can not be pinpointed to a specific location , but cover regions that extend over several cells.@xcite these are reminiscent of the fluctuations observed in supercooled colloidal and molecular liquids approaching the glass transition@xcite and include characteristic features of the dynamical and mechanical response , such as dynamical heterogeneities and heterogeneous stress patterns , that were first observed in glasses , colloids and granular materials and that have extensively been studied in soft condensed matter physics.@xcite it has also been argued that the migration patterns are sensitive to the expression of different adhesion proteins@xcite as well as to the properties of the extracellular environment,@xcite such as the stiffness of the substrate.@xcite these observations lead to the development of the notion of _ plithotaxis_,@xcite _ _ a universal mechanical principle akin to the more familiar chemotaxis , which states that each cell tends to move in a way that maintains minimal local intercellular shear stress . while plausible , it is yet to be determined whether plithotaxis is indeed a generic feature in all epithelial tissues .",
    "equally fascinating are the experiments on model systems that study cell migration in settings designed to mimic wound healing.@xcite for example , the existence of mechanical waves that span the entire tissue and generate long - range cell - guidance have been established in madin - darby canine kidney ( mdck ) epithelial cell monolayers.@xcite subtle correlations between purse - string contractility and large - scale remodelling of the tissue while closing circular gaps have also been identified.@xcite finally , a mechanism dubbed _ kenotaxis _ has been proposed,@xcite which suggests that there is a robust tendency of a collection of migrating cells to generate local tractions that systematically and ooperatively pull towards the empty regions of the substrate .    on the developmental side , in pioneering work , keller _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite constructed a light - sheet microscope that enabled them to track _ in vivo _ positions of each individual cell in a zebrafish embryo over a period of 24h .",
    "a quantitive analysis@xcite of the zebrafish embryo was also able to relate mechanical energy and geometry to the shapes of the aggregate surface cells .",
    "another extensively studied system that allows detailed tracking of individual cells is the _ drosophila _ embryo.@xcite in recent studies that combined experiments with advanced data analysis , it was possible to quantitatively account for shape change of the wing blade by decomposing it into cell divisions , cell rearrangements and cell shape changes.@xcite finally , it has recently become possible to track more than 100,000 individual cells in a chick embryo over a period exceeding 24 hours.@xcite this was achieved by developing an advanced light - sheet microscope and state - of - the - art data analysis techniques designed to automatically track individual cells in a transgenic chick embryo line with the cell membranes of all cells in the embryonic and extra embryonic tissues labelled with a green fluorescent protein tag .",
    "all these experiments and advanced data analysis techniques provide unprecedented insights into the early stages of the embryonic development , making it possible to connect processes at the level of individual cells with embryo - scale collective cell motion patterns .",
    "while there have been great advances in our understanding of how cells regulate force generation and transmission between each other and with the extracellular matrix in order to control their shape and cell - cell contacts,@xcite it is still not clear how these processes are coordinated at the tissue - level to drive tissue morphogenesis or allow the tissue to maintain its function once it reaches homeostasis .",
    "computer models of various levels of complexity have played an essential role in helping to answer many of those questions.@xcite one of the early yet successful approaches has been based on the cellular potts model ( cpm).@xcite in the cpm , cells are represented as groups of `` pixels '' of a given type .",
    "pixels are updated one at a time following a set of probabilistic rules .",
    "pixel updates in the cpm are computationally inexpensive,@xcite which allows for simulations of large systems . in addition , the cpm extends naturally to three dimensions.@xcite while very successful in describing cell sorting as well as certain aspects of tumour growth,@xcite cpm has several limitations , the main one being that the dynamics of pixel updates is somewhat artificial and very hard to relate to the dynamics of actual cells .",
    "this problem has been to some extent alleviated by the introduction of the subcellular element model ( scem).@xcite scem is an off - lattice model with each cell being represented as a collection of 100 - 200 elements - spherical particles interacting with their immediate neighbours via short - range soft - core potentials .",
    "therefore , scem is able to model cells of arbitrary shapes that grow , divide and move in 3d .",
    "the main disadvantage of scem is that it is computationally expensive ( off - lattice methods in general require more computations per time step compared to their lattice counterparts ) , and without a highly optimised parallel implementation , applications of the scem are limited to a few hundred cells at most , which is not sufficient to study effects that span long length- and time - scales .",
    "particle - based models have also been very successful at capturing many aspects of cell migration in tissues.@xcite however , when it comes to modelling confluent epithelial layers with the resolution of individual cells , one of the most widely and successfully used models is the vertex model ( vm ) .",
    "the vm originated in studies of the physics of foams in the 1970s and was first applied to model monolayer cell sheets in the early 1980s.@xcite over the past 35 years it has been implemented and extended numerous times and used to study a wide variety of different systems.@xcite the vm is in the core of the cell - based@xcite chaste,@xcite a versatile and widely used software package .",
    "the vm assumes that all cells in the epithelium are roughly the same height and thus that the entire system can be well approximated as a two - dimensional sheet .",
    "the conformation of the tissue in the vm is computed as a configuration that simultaneously optimises area and perimeter of all cells .",
    "while the model is quasi - static in nature , it captures remarkably well many properties of actual epithelial tissues .",
    "there have been numerous attempts to introduce dynamics into the vertex model.@xcite however , there are limitations associated with each approach .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , most dynamical versions of the vertex model seem to neglect fluctuations with a notable recent exception.@xcite in contrast , recent traction microscopy experiments@xcite suggest that these fluctuations might be a crucial ingredient in understanding collective cell migration . finally , we point out a technical point that makes the implementation of vm somewhat challenging .",
    "namely , in order to capture topology changing moves , such as cell neighbour exchanges , i.e. , t1 transitions , one has to perform rather complex mesh restructuring operations@xcite that require complex data structures and algorithms and that inevitably add to the computational complexity of the model .",
    "building upon the recently introduced self - propelled voronoi ( spv ) model,@xcite in this paper we apply the ideas introduced in the physics of active matter systems@xcite to the vm .",
    "this allows us to construct a hybrid , active vertex model ( avm ) that is able to accurately describe the collective migration dynamics of a large number of cells .",
    "the avm is implemented within _",
    ", an off - lattice particle - based simulation software developed specifically to study active matter systems .",
    "one of the key advantages of the hybrid approach presented in this study is that it not only enables studies of very large systems , but also introduces a very natural way to handle the t1 transitions , thus removing the need for complex mesh manipulations that are of uncertain physical and biological meaning .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we briefly review the general features of the vm and derive expressions for forces on individual cells central to the active vertex model . in section [ sec : examples ] we apply the model to a number of test cases .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusions ] we provide an outlook for future applications of this model .",
    "details of the force calculation and implementation are presented in the appendices .",
    "owing to its origins in the physics of foams,@xcite in the vm cells are modelled as two - dimensional convex polygons that cover the plane with no holes and overlaps , i.e. , the epithelial tissue is represented as a convex polygonal partitioning of the plane ( fig . [",
    "fig : vertex_model ] ) .",
    "the main simplification compared to models of foams is that the vm assumes that contacts between neighbouring cells are straight lines .",
    "in addition , neighbouring cells are also assumed to share a single edge , which is a simplification compared to real tissues , where junctions between two neighbouring cells consist of two separate cell membranes that can be independently regulated . typically , three junction lines meet at a vertex , although vertices with a higher number of contacts are also possible.@xcite the model tissue is therefore a mesh consisting of polygons ( i.e. , cells ) , edges ( i.e. , cell junctions ) , and vertices ( i.e. , meeting points of three or more cells ) .",
    "an energy is associated to each configuration of the mesh .",
    "it can be written as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the total number of cells , @xmath2 is the area of the cell @xmath3 , while @xmath4 is its reference area .",
    "@xmath5 is the area modulus , i.e. a constant with units of energy per area squared measuring how hard it is to change the cell s area .",
    "@xmath6 is the cell perimeter and @xmath7 ( with units of energy per length squared ) is the perimeter modulus that determines how hard it is to change perimeter @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath8 is the length of the junction between vertices @xmath9 and @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the tension of that junction ( with units of energy per length ) .",
    "@xmath12 in the last term denotes the sum is over all pairs of vertices that share a junction .",
    "note that the model allows for different cells to have different area and perimeter moduli as well as reference areas , allowing for modelling of tissues containing different cell types .",
    "r0.5        some authors write the perimeter term as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a reference perimeter , and omit the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vertex_model ] ) or completely omit the @xmath15 term.@xcite under the assumption that the values of @xmath11 for all junctions of the cell @xmath3 are the same , i.e. , @xmath16 , the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vertex_model ] ) becomes @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , if we identify @xmath18 , it immediately becomes clear that the descriptions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vertex_model ] ) and the model with the preferred perimeter are identical to each other .",
    "note that this is true up to the constant term @xmath19 , which is unimportant as it only shifts the overall energy and does not contribute to the force on the cell ( see below ) .",
    "the description in eq .  ( [ eq : vertex_model ] ) is slightly more general as it allows for the junctions to have different properties depending on the types of cells that are in contact .",
    "retaining the @xmath20 term is also advisable in order to prevent the model from becoming unstable if the area modulus is too small .",
    "it is straightforward to express cell area and cell perimeter in terms of vertex coordinates .",
    "therefore , vertex positions together with their connectivities uniquely determine the energy of the epithelial sheet , hence the name vertex model .",
    "the main assumption of the vm is that the tissue will always be in a configuration which minimises the total energy in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vertex_model ] ) . determining",
    "the minimum energy configuration is a non - trivial multidimensional optimisation problem and , with the exception of a few very simple cases , it can only be solved numerically . a basic implementation of the vm therefore needs to use advanced multidimensional numerical minimisation algorithms to determine the positions of vertices that minimise eq .  ( [ eq : vertex_model ] ) for a given set of parameters @xmath5 , @xmath7 and @xmath11 .",
    "most implementations,@xcite also introduce topology ( connectivity ) changing moves to model events such as cell rearrangements .",
    "there have been several attempts to introduce dynamics into the vm,@xcite including a recent study that introduced stochasticity into the junction tension.@xcite the idea behind such approaches it to write equations of motion for each vertex as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a friction coefficient and @xmath23 is the position vector of vertex @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath24 is the total force on vertex @xmath9 computed as the negative gradient of eq .",
    "( [ eq : vertex_model ] ) with respect to @xmath23 , i.e. , @xmath25 .",
    "we note that the exact meaning of friction in confluent epithelial tissues is the subject of an ongoing debate that is beyond the scope of this study . here , as in the case of most models to date , we assume that all effects of friction ( i.e. , between neighbouring cells as well as between cells and the substrate and the extracellular matrix ) can be modelled by a single constant . while this may appear to be a major simplification , as we will show below , the model is capable of capturing many key features of real epithelial tissues .",
    "( [ eq : eqation_of_motion_vertex ] ) is a first order equation since the mass terms have been omitted .",
    "this so - called overdamped limit is very common in biological systems , since the inertial effects are typically several orders of magnitude smaller than the effects arising from the cell - cell interactions or random fluctuations produced by the environment .",
    "note that the force on vertex @xmath9 depends on the position of its neighbouring vertices , resulting in a set of coupled non - linear ordinary differential equations . in most cases those equations",
    "can only be solved numerically .    while the introduction of dynamics alleviates some of the problems related to the quasi - static nature of the vm , one still has to implement topology changing moves if the model is to be applicable to describing cell intercalation events .",
    "this can lead to unphysical back and forth flips of the same junction and has only recently been analysed in full detail.@xcite      it is important to note that the vm in its original form is a _ quasi - static _ model . in other words",
    ", it assumes that at every instant in time , the tissue is in a state of mechanical equilibrium .",
    "this is a strong assumption , which is in line with many biological systems , especially in the case of embryos where cells actively grow , divide and rearrange . as a matter of fact ,",
    "biological systems are among the most common examples of systems out of equilibrium .",
    "therefore , while it is able to capture many of the mechanical properties of the tissue , the vm is unable to fully describe the effects that are inherently related of being out of equilibrium .",
    "many such effects are believed to be behind the collective migration patterns observed in recent experiments .",
    "in addition , in many dynamical implementations of the vm the effects of both thermal and non - thermal random fluctuations originating in complex intercellular processes and interactions with the environment are either completely omitted or not very clear . while for a system out of equilibrium the fluctuation - dissipation theorem@xcite does not hold , and the relation between random fluctuations and friction is not simple , it is even more important to note that fluctuations can have non - trivial effects on the collective motion patterns.@xcite    here we take an alternative approach and build a description similar to the recently introduced spv model.@xcite the idea behind the spv is that instead of treating vertices as the degrees of freedom , one tracks positions of cell centres .",
    "forces on cell centres are , however , computed from the energy of the vm , eq .",
    "( [ eq : vertex_model ] ) . the core assumption of the model is that the tissue confirmations correspond to the voronoi tessellations of the plane with cell centres acting as voronoi seeds .",
    "we recall that a voronoi tessellation is a polygonal tiling of the plane based on distances to a set of points , called _",
    "seeds_. for each seed point there is a corresponding polygon consisting of all points closer to that seed point than to any other .",
    "this imposes some restrictions onto possible tissue confirmations , i.e. , not all convex polygonal tessellations of the plane are necessarily voronoi , but it has recently been argued that voronoi tessellations can predict the diverse cell shape distributions of many tissues.@xcite furthermore , the exact details of the tessellation are not expected to play a significant role in the large scale behaviour of the tissue , which this model aims to describe .    in the original implementation of bi , _",
    "et al.@xcite _ the voronoi tessellation is computed at every time step .",
    "the vertices of the tessellation are then used to evaluate forces at all cell centres , that are , in turn , moved in accordance to those forces and the entire process is repeated . while conceptually clear , this procedure is numerically expensive as it requires computation of the entire voronoi diagram at each time step .",
    "this limits the accessible system size to several hundred cells .    here",
    ", we instead propose an alternative approach based on the delaunay triangulation .",
    "the delaunay triangulation for a set of points @xmath26 in the plane is a triangular tiling , @xmath27 , of the plane with the property that there are no points of @xmath26 inside the circumcircle of any of the triangles in @xmath27.@xcite a property of a delaunay triangulation that is key for this work is that it is possible to construct a so - called dual voronoi tessellation by connecting circumcenters of its triangles .",
    "this establishes a mathematical duality between delaunay and voronoi descriptions .",
    "this duality is exact and quantities , such as the force , expressed on the voronoi tiling have an exact map onto quantities expressed on its dual delaunay triangulation .",
    "although being non - linear ( see sec . [ subsec : force_cell ] ) , this map is relatively simple , and therefore fast to compute .",
    "an important property of the voronoi - delaunay duality is that continuous deformations of one map into continuous deformations of the other .",
    "in other words , smooth motion of a cell s centre will correspond to a smooth change in that cell s shape .",
    "this is crucial to ensuring that during the dynamical evolution the cell connectivity changes continuously , a feature that is essential for accurately modelling t1 transitions .",
    "the main advantage of working with the delaunay description is that while the voronoi tessellation has to be recomputed each time cell centres move , it is possible to retain the delaunay character of a triangulation via local edge flip moves ( fig .",
    "[ fig : model]c ) , which drastically increases the efficiency of the delaunay based approach and enables us to simulate systems containing tens of thousands of cells .    before we introduce the active vertex model ( avm ) , we pause to make a comment about the notation . in the following",
    ", we will always use latin letters to denote cells , i.e. positions of their centres , and greek letters to denote vertices of the dual voronoi tessellation , i.e. , meeting points of three or more cells .",
    "therefore , vertices of the vm will always carry greek indices ( fig .",
    "[ fig : model]a ) .          in the avm ,",
    "the area @xmath2 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vertex_model ] ) corresponding to the cell ( particle ) @xmath3 is the area of the polygon ( face ) of the voronoi polygon , @xmath28 , associated with @xmath3 .",
    "it is given as @xmath29 where @xmath23 is the position of vertex @xmath9 and @xmath30 is a unit - length vector perpendicular to the surface of the polygon - which does not depend on the position of the vertices in the plane .",
    "the sum is over all vertices of the voronoi cell and we close the loop with @xmath31 for @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the total number of vertices in the cell @xmath28 .",
    "this expression is just a discrete version of green s formula .",
    "similarly , the cell perimeter is @xmath34 with the same rules for the next neighbour of the `` last '' vertex .",
    "@xmath35 represents the euclidean length of the vector .    in order to make a connection between cell centres and indices of the voronoi tessellation we recall that for a given triangle in the delaunay triangulation , the position of its dual voronoi vertex coincides with the centre of the circumscribed circle",
    "the position of the circumcenter is given by ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : model]b ) @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are position vectors of the corners of the triangle and @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the barycentric coordinates ( see , eq .",
    "( [ eq : circum_lambda ] ) in appendix i ) , with @xmath43 .",
    "armed with the mapping in eq .",
    "( [ eq : r_mu_baricentric ] ) , we can proceed to compute the forces acting on each cell centre based on the vm energy functional in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vertex_model ] ) .",
    "this is done directly by computing the negative gradient of the energy .",
    "therefore , the force on the centre of cell @xmath3 is computed as @xmath44 the expression for the gradient is made somewhat complicated by the fact that the derivative is taken with respect to the position of the cell centre , while the energy of the vm is naturally written in terms of the positions of the dual vertices . after a lengthy but straightforward calculation ( see appendix i ) we obtain : @xmath45^{t}\\left[\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{r}_{\\nu}}{\\partial\\mathbf{r}_{i}}\\right]\\nonumber \\\\   & -\\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\gamma_{k}p_{k}\\sum_{\\nu\\in\\omega_{k}}\\left(\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{\\nu,\\nu-1}-\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{\\nu+1,\\nu}\\right)^{t}\\left[\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{r}_{\\nu}}{\\partial\\mathbf{r}_{i}}\\right]\\nonumber \\\\   & -\\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\sum_{\\nu\\in\\omega_{k}}\\left[\\lambda_{\\nu-1,\\nu}\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{\\nu,\\nu-1}-\\lambda_{\\nu,\\nu+1}\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{\\nu+1,\\nu}\\right]^{t}\\left[\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{r}_{\\nu}}{\\partial\\mathbf{r}_{i}}\\right].\\label{eq : force_expression}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the last expression , @xmath46 $ ] is the @xmath47 jacobian matrix ( see appendix i ) connecting coordinates of cell centres with coordinates of the dual voronoi tessellation and @xmath48^{t}\\left[\\cdot\\right]$ ] denotes a row - matrix product producing a @xmath49 column vector .",
    "note that this product does not commute , i.e. , the order in which terms appear in the expression above is important .",
    "@xmath1 is the total number of cells in the system .",
    "we note that most terms in the @xmath50 sum in eq .",

    "i.e. , computing the force does not require including cell centre positions beyond the immediate neighbourhood of a given cell .",
    "this is extremely beneficial from a computational point of view as one can readily utilise standard force cutoff techniques , such as cell and neighbour lists@xcite in order to speed up force computations .",
    "it is also evident that the force in eq .",
    "( [ eq : force_expression ] ) is not pairwise , i.e. , it can not be written as a sum of forces acting on a pair of cells , or in mathematical terms , @xmath59 .",
    "this is not surprising since the position of the voronoi vertices depends on the position of three cell centres .",
    "the avm also includes the _ cell polarity@xcite _ modelled as a unit length vector , @xmath60 , laying in the @xmath61 plane .",
    "this vector determines the direction of the cell s motion and division and should not be confused with apical - basal polarity , which is not included in this model . in the simplest case , the vector @xmath60 does not take any preferred direction , but instead randomly fluctuates under the influence of uncorrelated random noise originating from the intercellular processes and the environment .",
    "this simple model can be augmented to include several different models for cell - cell alignment .",
    "for example , a cell can be given a tendency to align its polarity to its immediate neighbours by minimising the alignment energy , @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the alignment strength and the sum is over all nearest neighbours of @xmath3 .",
    "this model is similar to the vicsek model , which is used in studies of flocking , e.g. of swarms of birds.@xcite the molecular details of polar alignment are not yet understood in detail .",
    "it as been argued that in some tissue systems this involves components of the planar cell polarity signalling cascade,@xcite but even here their precise coordination and involvement are as yet not resolved .",
    "alternative alignment mechanisms consider only internal processes in the cell and do not directly depend on the polarity of the neighbouring cells .",
    "one such mechanism introduced in physics of active matter@xcite assumes that cell polarisation vector aligns with the migration direction of the cell , i.e. , @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the normalised cell velocity vector and @xmath66 is the alignment strength .",
    "finally , @xmath60 can also align to the direction of the eigenvector of the cell shape tensor , i.e. the cell seeks align direction of @xmath60 along its long axis .",
    "this is achieved by minimising the value of the energy @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the alignment strength and @xmath69 is the eigenvector of the matrix@xcite @xmath70 corresponding to its largest eigenvalue .",
    "this mechanism is one possible pathway to obtain _",
    "each of these alignment mechanisms causes a torque on @xmath60 , given by @xmath71 in the _ samos _ implementation of the avm , one can select which of these alignment mechanisms are to be included in an actual simulation .      we proceed to write equations of motion for the position and orientation of cell @xmath3 in the avm . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : overview ] , at the cellular scale inertial effects are negligible . in this overdamped limit ,",
    "the equation of motion for the position of the cell centre is just force balance between friction and driving forces .",
    "if we assume that the friction of the cell with its surrounding and the substrate is isotropic and can be modelled by the single friction coefficient @xmath22 , the equation of motion for the position of cell centre @xmath3 becomes @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the sum of all forces acting on the cell , i.e. , a sum of the vm model forces given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : force_expression ] ) and the soft - core repulsion defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : v_soft ] ) in appendix i. @xmath74 is an uncorrelated stochastic force that models the effects of random fluctuations .",
    "these fluctuations originate from the intracellular processes and interactions with the environment . in its simplest possible form",
    ", one can assume that @xmath74 has no time correlations , i.e. , each cell experiences a random `` kick '' at a given instant of time whose magnitude and direction do not depend on any past `` kicks '' on that cell .",
    "formally , we write @xmath75 and @xmath76 , where @xmath77 measures the average magnitude of the stochastic force and is interpreted as an effective translational diffusion coefficient , @xmath78 and @xmath79 denotes the statistical average .",
    "finally , the term @xmath80 has its origins in the physics of active matter systems.@xcite it models _ activity _ , i.e. , internal cellular processes that drive it to move in the direction of its polarity . the active force strength @xmath81 controls the magnitude of this activity .",
    "while the biological meaning of @xmath81 may appear unclear , it quantifies a cell s ability to move on its own due to the complex molecular machinery within it .",
    "in many models of individual cells crawling on a substrate with a prominent lamellipodium , the resultant active velocity @xmath82 is due either actin tread - milling,@xcite differential friction or differential contractility . in an epithelium ,",
    "on the other hand , @xmath81 should be understood as an effective parameter that models the non - balanced active force due to junction contractions and internal cell contractility.@xcite although the molecular origin of @xmath83 is at present not fully understood , even this simple description of the activity combined with the cell polarity alignment models discussed in the previous subsection leads to collective behaviour that resembles behaviour observed in experiments .",
    "we then write equations for motion for the polarity vector . if we define the angle of vector @xmath60 with the @xmath84axis as @xmath85 , then @xmath86 and we have @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the torque acting on @xmath60 , given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : torque ] ) , @xmath89 is the local normal to the cell surface ( i.e. , simply the unit length vector in the @xmath90-direction ) , @xmath91 is the orientational friction , and @xmath92 is responsible for introducing an orientational randomness .",

    "the related time scale @xmath96 measures the time necessary for the cell polarisation direction to decorrelate due to fluctuations produced by cellular processes and the environment .",

    "( [ eq : motion_postition ] ) and ( [ eq : motion_direction ] ) describe the cell dynamics in the avm .",

    "we do not include such effects .",
    "adding such effects to the model would be straightforward .",
    "finally , cell division is modelled based on the ideas of bell and anderson.@xcite the cell can only divide once its area is larger then some critical area @xmath101 , in which case it divides with probability proportional to @xmath102 , i.e. , @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a constant with units of inverse area times time . upon division",
    "the two daughter cells are placed along the direction of the vector @xmath60 and their ages are reset to zero .",
    "the delaunay triangulation is rebuilt after every division or death event .",
    "the cell cycle is clearly a far more complex phenomenon than what is captured by this simple model .",
    "the simplest possible extension would be to build upon the ideas of smith and martin,@xcite or use many other more sophisticated models available in the literature .",
    "adding such extensions to the avm would be straightforward and will be included in later versions of the model .      in an actual simulation ,",
    "we start either from carefully constructed initial positions of cell centres or choose cell positions from a particular experimental system . those positions",
    "are then used to build the initial delaunay triangulation and its corresponding dual voronoi tessellation . however , as the cell centres move , there is no guarantee that the delaunay character of the triangulation is preserved . for the model to be able",
    "to properly capture cell dynamics we , however , need to ensure that the triangulation is indeed delaunay at each time step . building a new triangulation in every time step",
    "would be computationally costly .",
    "instead , we apply the so - called equiangulation procedure:@xcite for every edge in the triangulation we compute the sum of the angles opposite to it . if the sum is larger than @xmath105 we `` flip '' the edge ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : model]c ) .",
    "the procedure is repeated until there are no more edges left to flip .",
    "one can show@xcite that this procedure always converges and leads to a delaunay triangulation . while equiangulation is not the most efficient way to build a delaunay triangulation `` from scratch '' ,",
    "if one starts with a triangulation that is nearly delaunay , in practice only a handful of flip moves are required to recover the delaunay triangulation .",
    "given that cell centres move continuously , in the avm the equiangulation procedure significantly increases the efficiency of maintaining the delaunay triangulation throughout the simulation .",
    "it is important to note that edge flips are local and flipping one edge in the delaunay triangulation only affects one edge of the dual voronoi tessellation .",
    "this means that a single edge flip can only affect junctions between four cells .",
    "the centres of those four cells coincide with the locations of the four corners of the polygon formed by two triangles sharing the flipped edge ( see , fig .",

    "this assumption is reasonable if one studies a relatively small region of a much larger epithelial tissue .",
    "many experiments , especially those of cell migration on elastic substrates , however , are performed with a relatively small number of cells where the effects of boundaries can not be neglected or are even the main focus of the study . therefore ,",
    "in the avm we include an open , flexible boundary .    in order to avoid very costly checks of topology changes , we assume that the topology ( connectivity ) of the boundary is maintained throughout the entire simulation .",
    "this does not mean that the boundary is fixed .",
    "it can grow , shrink and change its shape , but it can not change its topology , e.g. it is not possible to transition from a disk to an annulus .",
    "examples of allowed and disallowed changes of the boundary are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : boundary_topology ] .",
    "while fixing the boundary topology may appear restrictive , we will see below that in practice a model with fixed topology of the boundary allows for detailed studies of a broad range of problems directly applicable to many current experiments .    in the avm ,",
    "the degrees of freedom are cell centres , represented as particles .",
    "these particles serve as sites of the delaunay triangulation . in order to handle boundaries",
    "we introduce a special type of _ boundary _ particle and in addition , we also specify the connectivity between the boundary particles .",
    "boundary particles together with their connectivity information form a _ boundary line_. this line sets the topology of the boundary , which is preserved throughout the simulation , and delineates between the tissue and its surrounding .",
    "in addition , the boundary line can have an energy associated to it .",
    "biologically , this boundary energy corresponds to the complex molecular machinery , such as actin cables , that is known to affect the behaviour of the free edge of an epithelial sheet .",
    "specifically , we introduce the boundary line tension , @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the line tension of the edge connecting boundary vertices @xmath3 and @xmath55 , @xmath108 is the length of that edge and @xmath109 is its native ( preferred ) length . in addition , we also introduce the boundary bending stiffness @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the stiffness of angle @xmath85 at the boundary particle @xmath3 , determined as @xmath112 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the positions of boundary particles to the left and to the right of particle @xmath37 . for simplicity , we assume that each boundary particle has exactly two boundary neighbours .",
    "this prevents somewhat pathological , `` cross - like '' configurations where two otherwise disjoint domains would hinge on a single boundary site .",
    "r0.5        it is important to note that boundary particles do not represent centres of an actual cell .",
    "the voronoi polygon dual to a boundary particle in a delaunay triangulation extends out to infinity .",
    "consequently , it is not possible to unambiguously assign quantities such as the associated area or perimeter to boundary particles .",
    "therefore , only internal particles correspond to cell centres , while boundary particles should be thought of as `` ghosts '' that serve to mark the edge of the cell sheet .",
    "these particles , however , experience forces from the interior of the tissue as well as from the interactions with their neighbours on the boundary .",
    "the boundary line is able to dynamically adjust its shape and length in this manner .",

    "it also avoids discontinuous jumps at finite edge length , bypassing the t1 point altogether , also a feature of a number of models , notably those based on sequential energy minimisation.@xcite next to its high computational efficiency , the ability to smoothly go through a t1 transition without the need for any additional manipulations of either the delaunay triangulation or the voronoi tessellation is one of the key advantages of the avm approach .    , with @xmath114 ) with respect to the t1 event .",
    "initially , cells 2 and 4 are in contact ( red line ) . approaching the transition , the connecting line slowly contracts , until it becomes a point at the transition .",
    "cells 1 and 3 make a new contact which then rapidly expands .",
    "the arrows represent the force on the cell centre resulting from the vertex potential ( green ) , which partially compensates the active self - propulsion force ( yellow ) to give the resultant total force ( red ) .",

    "[ fig : shapes]c we show an example of yet another very interesting situation , where cells are grown in a confined region of space .",
    "in this paper we have introduced the active vertex model .",
    "it is a hybrid model that combines ideas from the physics of active matter with the vertex model , a widely used description for modelling confluent epithelial tissues .",
    "active matter physics is a rapidly growing field of research in soft condensed matter physics , and it is emerging as a natural framework for describing many biophysical processes , in particular those that occur at mesoscales , i.e. , at the scales that span multiple cells to the entire tissue .",
    "our approach is complementary to the recently introduced self - propelled voronoi model,@xcite for it allows modelling of systems with fixed and open , i.e. dynamically changing boundaries as well as cell - cell alignment , cell growth , division and death .",
    "the avm has been implemented into the _ samos _ software package and is publicly available under a non - restrictive open source license .",
    "the avm utilises a mathematical duality between delaunay and voronoi tessellation in order to relate forces on cell centres to the positions of the vertices of the dual lattice , i.e. meeting points of three of more cells - a natural description of a confluent epithelial tissue .",
    "this not only allows for a straightforward and efficient implementation using standard algorithms for particle - based simulations , but provides a natural framework for modelling topological changes in the tissue , such as intercalation and ingression events . in other words , in the avm t1 transition events arise spontaneously and it is not necessary to perform any additional steps in order to ensure that cells are able to exchange neighbours .",
    "furthermore , our implementation of the avm is very efficient , allowing for simulations of systems containing tens of thousands of cells on a single cpu core , thus enabling one to probe collective features , such as global cell flow patterns that span length - scales of several millimetres .",
    "in addition , the avm is also able to handle multiple cell types and type specific cell contacts , which allows simulations of mechanically heterogeneous systems .",
    "all these features make the avm a strong candidate model to address many interesting biological and biophysical problems related to the mechanical response of epithelial tissues , especially those that occur at large length and time scales that are typically only accessible to continuum models . unlike in the case of continuum models where relating parameters of the model to the experimental systems is often difficult and unclear",
    ", the avm retains the cell - level resolution , making it simpler to connect it to the processes that occur at scales of single cells .",
    "the avm is , however , not designed to replace continuum models , but to serve as the important layer that connects the complex molecular processes that occur at the cell level with the global collective behaviour observed at the level of the entire tissue .    with that in mind",
    ", there are , of course , still many ways the model can be improved . for examples",
    ", it would be very interesting to augment the avm to include the effects of biochemical signalling .",
    "this would require solving a set of differential equations for signals in each time step , and then supplying those solutions to the mechanics part of the model .",
    "adding such functionality would substantially increase the computational cost of simulations , however at the same time it would allow for detailed studies of the coupling between chemical and mechanical signalling .",
    "these are believed to be essential for developing a full understanding of the mechanics of epithelial tissues .",
    "given the layout of the avm and its implementation , implementing such functionality would be straightforward .",
    "furthermore , in the current version of the avm activity is introduced in a very rudimentary manner , via assuming that cells self - propel in the direction of their polarity vector .",
    "this is a very strong assumption that would need a much stronger experimental support than currently available .",
    "it is also possible that a far more sophisticated model would be required to fully capture cell s motility .",
    "however , one also needs to keep in mind that there is a tradeoff between being as biologically accurate as possible and retaining a sufficient level of simplicity to be able to efficiently perform simulations of large systems . with all this in mind ,",
    "we argue that the our simulations clearly show that even this simplistic model of self - propulsion is capable of capturing many features of real systems , and that it can serve as a good starting point for building biologically more accurate descriptions .",
    "another potentially very interesting feature that is currently not supported would be splitting and merging of the boundaries , that is , allowing for topological changes of the entire sheet such as those depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : boundary_topology]c .",
    "this would us to study detachment of a part of the tissue or opening apertures as well as the opposite problem of closing holes and gaps .",
    "the latter is of great importance for studying problems related to wound healing .",
    "unfortunately , setting up a set of general rules on how to automatically split a boundary line or merge two boundaries into a single one is not a simple task from a point of view of computational geometry .",
    "the problem is further complicated if those rules are also to be made biologically plausible , which is essential for the model to be relevant to actual experiments .",
    "we conclude by noting that extending the model to a curved surface or making it fully three - dimensional would be more involved .",
    "being able to study curved epithelial sheets , however , would be of great interest to systems where curvature clearly can not be ignored , e.g. , as in the case in modelling intestinal crypts.@xcite while there is nothing in the description of the avm that is unique to the planar geometry , there are several technical challenges associated with directly porting it onto a curved surface .",
    "most notably , building a delaunay triangulation on an arbitrary curved surface is not a simple task .",
    "in addition , quantities such as bending rigidity that are naturally defined on triangles would have to be properly mapped onto contacts lines between neighbouring cells .",
    "this is not straightforward to do .",
    "developing a fully three - dimensional version of the avm would be an even a greater challenge since the duality between delaunay and voronoi descriptions central to this model has no analogue in three dimensions .",
    "we hope that the avm will provide a useful and complementary tool for probing the aspects of the epithelial tissue mechanics that are not available to other methods , as well as serve as an independent validation for the results obtained by other methods .",

    "finally , we briefly address another contribution to the force which needs to be added to the model allow for simulations deep in the liquid - like phase . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : phase_diagram ] , similar to the spv model , the avm shows a transition between solid - like and fluid - like phases . in the solid - like phase ,",
    "intercalation events are inhibited and without cell division and death , cells do not exchange their neighbours . in the fluid - like phase , on the other hand , cells are much more mobile and one observes a large number of t1 transitions and intercalations . in this regime ,",
    "the delaunay triangulation is very irregular with many obtuse triangles .",
    "if a triangle becomes very obtuse , its circumcenter is far outside the triangle and even small changes in the position of one of its vertices leads to large movements of the circumcenter . for any simulation time step that is not extremely small",
    ", this can lead to unphysical self intersections of the triangulation and cause the simulation to be unreliable , or , in the most extreme cases , causes it to crash . in practice , in order to prevent this from happening while still being able to use a reasonably large time step , we endow each cell centre with a soft repulsive core of radius @xmath162 . the repulsive potential between neighbouring cell centres is then given as @xmath299 where @xmath300 .",
    "this core prevents two cell centres from getting too close to each other .",
    "the corresponding force on cell @xmath3 is @xmath301 with @xmath302 and according to the newton s third law , @xmath303 .",
    "the soft repulsion does not interfere with the avm dynamics except for its regularising effect . in fig .",
    "[ fig : gallery]e - g , the pale spheres drawn at the cell centres have radius @xmath162 , and they remain far removed from the cell boundaries .",
    "we note that this repulsive force is similar in spirit to the limits that have to be imposed on edge lengths in order to prevent unphysical self - intersections in the triangulated models for lipid membranes , that have been extensively studied in the 1990s.@xcite it is interesting to note that in the case of triangulated models for lipid membranes one also needs to introduce a maximum allowed edge length in order to prevent unphysical configurations . in the case of avm , this is not necessary .",
    "due to the dynamic nature of the model , even without cell division and death , it is not possible to retain a constant number of boundary particles .",
    "instead , the boundary line has to be able to contract or extend in order to accommodate changes inside the tissue .",
    "this is achieved by dynamically adding and removing boundary particles .",
    "we first focus on the boundary expansion .",
    "we require that all cells are contained within the boundary , that is , no dual vertices belonging to a cell are allowed to `` spill '' over the boundary line .",
    "this condition is violated if the angle opposite to a boundary edge is greater than @xmath304 . in this case",
    ", the centre of the circumscribed circle falls outside the triangle and , therefore , outside the boundary .",
    "in order to prevent this from happening we perform the following check ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : boundary_vertex_add ] ) :    1 .   for each boundary edge @xmath305 compute angle @xmath306 at the particle @xmath307 opposite to it .",
    "2 .   if @xmath308 1 .   compute the position , @xmath309 , of the new particle @xmath310 by mirroring the coordinates of @xmath307 , @xmath311 , with respect to edge @xmath305 .",

    "add a new boundary particle @xmath310 at position @xmath309 and mark it as boundary .",
    "3 .   remove boundary edge @xmath305 , i.e. , the two boundary particles at its end are no longer neighbours .",
    "4 .   connect @xmath310 to the two boundary particles disconnected in ( c ) .",
    "connect @xmath310 to @xmath307 .",
    "3 .   if at least one new boundary particle was added in 2 . , rebuild the triangulation .",
    "note that the procedure outlined above always converges in a single step .",
    "shrinking of the boundary is achieved by removing particles that have no connections to the internal particles .",
    "in this situation , no part of a cell can be inside a triangle that has two of its sides being boundary edges and it can be safely removed . the algorithm schematically outlined in fig .",
    "[ fig : boudnary_removal ] is as follows :    1 .   for each boundary",
    "particle @xmath314 compute number of edges @xmath315 that the particle belongs to . 2 .   if @xmath316 remove @xmath314 .",
    "note that the position of the `` dangling '' particles does not directly affect the shape of the cell .",
    "an important point to make here is that the algorithms used to add and remove boundary particles _ do not _ lead to sudden discontinuous changes of the shape of the cell or the force acting on its centre .",
    "however , addition and removal of boundary particles inevitably leads to discontinuous changes in the forces acting on boundary particles .",
    "a potential way to avoid such discontinuous behaviour would be to , e.g. , smoothly `` turn on '' the interactions with newly added particles or by slowly `` fade out '' interaction with particles that are to be removed . in practice , however , the discontinuous causes by simply adding or removing boundary particles lead to changes in the force that are small and do not appreciably affect the simulation .",

    "examples of data and configuration files can be found in the _ configurations _ directory in the _ samos _ installation .",

    "the main addition to the code involves a light - weight implementation of the half - edge data structure@xcite as a separate , _ mesh _ class .",
    "this class holds the information about the delaunay triangulation and computes its dual voronoi diagram",

    "finally , _ mesh _ computes the jacobian matrix , @xmath46 $ ] and supplies its elements to the part of the code that computes the force on the cells .",

    "the delaunay triangulation of the initial positions of the cell centres is performed using cgal s delaunay library.@xcite in order to properly include the boundary of the cell sheet , we compute a constrained delaunay triangulation,@xcite where the boundary line , supplied by the user as an input file , acts as the constraint placed on the triangulation .",
    "it is important to note that all delaunay triangulation libraries always produce a convex hull of the region that needs to be triangulated .",
    "the existence of the boundary line and the use of the constrained triangulation method allows us to simply and clearly distinguish between the triangles that are `` inside '' the tissue and should be kept and the `` outside '' ones that are an artefact of the triangulation procedure and should be discarded .",
