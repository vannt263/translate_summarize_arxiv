    "several gravitational wave ( gw ) detectors are currently planned to be constructed in space @xcite .",
    "the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) @xcite is designed to detect the passage of a gravitational wave by measuring the time - varying changes of optical pathlength between free - falling masses .",
    "lisa consists of three spacecraft in heliocentric orbits , forming a triangle with sides @xmath2 long .",
    "the lisa program was born more than ten years ago as a joint project of esa and nasa .",
    "recently , a variant of lisa was proposed , which is called new gravitational wave observatory ( ngo ) or evolved lisa ( elisa ) .",
    "the big bang observer ( bbo ) @xcite has been proposed as the successor of lisa .",
    "bbo is composed of four lisa type space detectors orbiting the sun , two of them collocated . in this case",
    "the arm length is @xmath3 .",
    "a japanese project with similar characteristics is the deci - hertz interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( decigo ) @xcite .",
    "the latter detectors would bridge the frequency gap between lisa and terrestrial detectors .",
    "these gw observatories will be able to measure a stochastic background of cosmological origin @xcite .",
    "the detection of a primordial background of gravitational radiation would provide a direct probe of the physics in the early universe , since gws propagate freely after being produced .",
    "cosmological sources of gravitational radiation include quantum fluctuations during inflation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , scalar condensate fragmentation into q - balls @xcite , cosmic strings ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , plasma turbulence and magnetic fields ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a possible scenario for the generation of a primordial gw background is a first - order phase transition of the universe @xcite . quite interestingly",
    ", gws produced at the temperature scale of the electroweak phase transition , @xmath4 , would have a characteristic frequency today ( after redshifting ) near the sensitivity peak of lisa , @xmath5 .",
    "this motivated the investigation of gw production in the electroweak phase transition @xcite .    in a first - order phase transition ,",
    "bubbles of the stable phase nucleate and expand , converting the high - temperature phase into the low - temperature one ( for the dynamics of a cosmological first - order phase transition see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "gravitational waves are generated either by the collisions of bubbles @xcite or by the turbulence that is produced in the plasma due to the motion of bubble walls @xcite .",
    "in general , turbulence turns out to be a more effective source of gravitational radiation than bubble collisions . in the standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "the electroweak phase transition is not first - order @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the disturbance caused in the fluid is not enough to generate a significant gw signal .",
    "models which give strongly first - order phase transitions and , consequently , a greater departure from equilibrium have been extensively studied in the context of electroweak baryogenesis @xcite .",
    "the gw production can be calculated as a function of a few quantities related to the dynamics of the phase transition ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these quantities are the temperature , the bubble wall velocity , the bubble size ( or the duration of the phase transition ) , and the fraction of the released energy which goes into bulk motions of the fluid ( the efficiency factor ) .",
    "the latter can be calculated as a function of the amount of supercooling and the wall velocity @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the wall is usually assumed to propagate as a jouguet detonation , so that the wall velocity and the efficiency factor have a simple dependence on the amount of supercooling .",
    "this motivated some model - independent analysis which find the electroweak gw spectrum as a function of two parameters , namely , the duration of the phase transition and the amount of supercooling ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in a given model , though , these parameters are linked , and it is important to investigate specific cases .",
    "such investigations were performed , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "however , it is well known that the wall velocity does not only depend on the amount of supercooling but also on the friction with the surrounding plasma . in general , the hydrodynamic solution is not a jouguet detonation .",
    "contrary to the case of gravitational waves , calculations of electroweak baryogenesis usually assume small wall velocities .",
    "the bubble growth mechanism has been studied for several years ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , there has been a renewed interest .",
    "the wall velocity was calculated taking into account hydrodynamics and microphysics in refs .",
    "@xcite . in ref . @xcite the microphysics in the ultra - relativistic regime was considered , finding that bubble walls may run away .",

    "@xcite for the whole range of wall velocities .",
    "in the present paper we study the generation of gravitational waves in the electroweak phase transition .",
    "we consider physical models and we include in the calculation some aspects of the dynamics which have not been taken into account previously .",
    "in particular , we incorporate the recent results on the hydrodynamics and microphysics of moving walls .",
    "we follow the evolution of the phase transition , taking into account the nucleation and expansion of bubbles , and the variation of temperature .",
    "we also take into account the effect of temperature inhomogeneities on the nucleation rate .",
    "we consider extensions of the sm with extra bosons , extra fermions , and the mssm in the light - stop scenario .",
    "our aim is to discuss the detectability of the gravitational radiation by lisa and other proposed detectors .",
    "thus , we calculate the peak of the gw spectrum from bubble collisions and from turbulence , as a function of the parameters of each model . in this work",
    "we shall ignore the possible presence of magnetic fields , which would modify the turbulence mechanism @xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in the next section",
    "we review the mechanisms for generation of gravitational waves by turbulence and bubble collisions . in section [ dynamics ]",

    "we have @xmath25the typical wavelength will be a fraction of the hubble size @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , it is convenient to consider @xmath27 , where the hubble rate is given by the friedmann equation , @xmath28here , @xmath29 is the total energy density , where @xmath30 is the energy density of radiation and @xmath31 is the false vacuum energy density .",
    "thus , we can express the frequency of the gws today as @xmath32 the characteristic frequency is determined by the typical length scale of the source @xmath33 .",
    "thus , one expects the peak of the spectrum to be at a frequency @xmath34 .",
    "the energy density of gravitational waves is given by @xcite @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the tensor metric perturbation , and the brackets denote ensemble average .",
    "the equation for @xmath36 is of the form @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the energy - momentum tensor of the source . on dimensional grounds ,",
    "one expects the magnitude of @xmath36 to be given by @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the average kinetic energy density in bulk motions of the relativistic fluid .",
    "similarly , we expect @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath42 . using eq .",
    "( [ hrad ] ) , this gives @xmath43 .",
    "after the phase transition , the total energy density @xmath44 goes into radiation , and then evolves as @xmath45 .",

    "] , @xmath53 in a first - order phase transition , the moving walls of expanding bubbles cause perturbations in the cosmic fluid .",
    "the bulk motions of the fluid produce gws once bubbles collide and lose their spherical symmetry .",
    "in addition , bubble collisions generate turbulence , which is another source of gws .",
    "let us first consider bubble collisions .",
    "a simulation with a large number of bubbles was carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite using the envelope approximation .",
    "this approximation neglects the overlap regions of colliding bubbles and follows only the evolution of the uncollided bubble walls ( assuming thin fluid profiles ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite the bubbles were assumed to nucleate with a rate per volume and time given by @xmath54 , \\label{gammabeta}\\ ] ] and to expand with a constant velocity @xmath55 .",
    "the result for the peak frequency and intensity from the simulation is @xcite @xmath56 this result agrees with eqs .",
    "( [ fp ] ) and ( [ omegap ] ) , except for a slight difference in the dependence on @xmath55 .",
    "this can be seen by assuming @xmath57 , since the time scale in this simulation is given by @xmath58 .",
    "the parameter @xmath58 does not depend on details of the dynamics of the phase transition and is relatively easy to estimate for a given model . according to eq .",
    "( [ gammabeta ] ) , we have @xmath59 the temperature decrease rate is governed by the hubble rate , @xmath60 .",
    "hence , we have @xmath61    concerning turbulence , one expects that eddies of a given scale @xmath62 will generate gws with frequency given by @xmath63 and energy density given by eq .",
    "( [ omegap ] ) .",
    "the size distribution of the eddies , as well as the energy distribution of the turbulence , is difficult to determine . in general",
    ", a single stirring scale @xmath62 is assumed in the calculation . below this scale ,",
    "a kolmogorov spectrum is established , according to which eddies of a given size break into smaller ones .",
    "this generates a cascade of energy which ends at a much smaller scale , related to the viscosity of the fluid . above the stirring scale ,",
    "the spectrum is determined by causality . in ref .",
    "@xcite , these two behaviors were assumed on each side of the stirring scale . in this case",
    ", the result for the peak agrees with the estimate ( [ omegap ] ) .",
    "more recently @xcite , turbulence was modeled using a smooth interpolation between the large scale behavior and the small scale one . besides",

    "( [ omegap ] ) , @xmath69 .      as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , deciding which bubble size is relevant for turbulence is a major source of uncertainty .",
    "bubbles of different sizes are present at the collision time .",
    "the bubbles of a given size stir up the fluid at that size scale , hence producing eddies of that scale .",
    "larger bubbles in principle generate larger eddies and a larger gw intensity , whereas smaller bubbles in principle generate smaller eddies , but are more abundant . in any case , it is not clear which will be the turbulence spectrum in the case of several stirring scales .",
    "although last nucleated bubbles are more abundant , they act during a shorter time and , furthermore , are probably `` eaten '' by larger bubbles . in our numerical calculations",
    "we shall use the size of the largest bubbles at percolation .",
    "notice that , in contrast , there is no ambiguity in the production of gws through bubble collisions , since the numerical fit ( [ fpcoll])-([omegapcoll ] ) was obtained as a function of the parameters used in the simulation @xcite .",
    "there is only some arbitrariness in the temperature at which the parameter @xmath58 should be calculated , since in a real phase transition @xmath70 is not a constant .",
    "we can obtain a simple estimate of the bubble size dispersion if we assume a nucleation rate of the form ( [ gammabeta ] ) and a constant wall velocity , and we neglect bubble overlapping . the bubbles which nucleated at time @xmath71 have a radius @xmath72 at the percolation time @xmath73 , and occupy a volume @xmath74 . thus , for the largest bubbles , which nucleated at time @xmath75 , we have @xmath76 on the other hand , the bubbles which occupy the largest volume are given by the condition @xmath77 . using eq .

    ", the parameter @xmath58 does not have a huge variation between @xmath75 and @xmath88 [ this validates the approximation ( [ gammabeta ] ) ] , except for very strong phase transitions . in general , the variation of @xmath58 will not even compensate the factor 3 between eqs .",
    "( [ tv ] ) and ( [ rmaxmal ] ) .",
    "for very strong phase transitions , on the other hand , @xmath89 may become negative .",

    "we can estimate the factor as follows .",

    "the problem with the extra fermions is that , compared to the case of bosons , larger values of the coupling @xmath515 are needed to obtain a strongly first - order phase transition .",
    "larger values of @xmath515 cause a larger friction coefficient .",

    "therefore , we shall consider spaceborne detectors .",
    "the sensitivity curves in fig .",
    "[ gwgral ] are approximate .",
    "the sensitivity for elisa ( upper blue line ) was calculated using the analytical approximation from ref .",
    "the other sensitivities were calculated from the specifications of the detectors , following the method described in ref .",
    "specifications for lisa ( lower blue line ) can be found in @xcite , specifications for bbo ( upper purple curve ) can be found in @xcite and specifications for decigo ( upper orange curve ) can be found in @xcite .",
    "being composed of several lisa type detectors , the latter two will be able to make a correlation analysis between two independent detectors .",
    "the correlation analysis is expected to increase the sensitivity of bbo to a stochastic background by four orders of magnitude @xcite ( lower purple curve ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the ultimate sensitivity of decigo is estimated to be @xmath524 around @xmath525 @xcite ( lower orange curve ) .",
    "the predicted signals for the different models are shown in black in fig .",
    "[ gwgral ] .",
    "for all the models we considered , the parameters which give frequencies at the sensitivity peak of lisa ( @xmath526 ) give intensities a few orders of magnitude below the peak sensitivity @xmath527 .",
    "we see that lisa s sensitivity curve is instead achieved at characteristic frequencies @xmath528 , by somewhat extreme models , namely , those with extra scalars with quite strong couplings to the higgs .",
    "subsequent detectors like bbo or the japanese decigo will have a sensitivity peak about two orders of magnitude below that of lisa , @xmath529-@xmath530 .",
    "however , this peak sensitivity will be for a frequency @xmath531 , far away from electroweak gw signals of that intensity .",
    "as can be seen in the figure , neither bbo nor decigo will , in principle , improve lisa s possibility of detecting a gw signal from the electroweak phase transition .",
    "nevertheless , after a correlation analysis , bbo will possibly be able to detect electroweak gws for a wider range of sm extensions , e.g. , extra bosons with moderate couplings or strongly coupled extra fermions .",
    "the detection would be further improved by the ultimate sensitivity of decigo .",
    "the latter seems to be the only possibility for detecting electroweak gravitational waves in the case of the mssm . in the case of the nmssm",
    "we expect a signal similar to that of the sm with an extra singlet .",
    "we have calculated the intensity and characteristic frequency of gravitational radiation generated in the electroweak phase transition .",
    "we have considered several extensions of the standard model which provide strongly first - order phase transitions , and we have discussed the detectability of these models by planned spaceborne gravitational wave detectors .    we have improved the treatment of previous works on the dynamics of the phase transition by including in the calculation the hydrodynamics and microphysics of the bubble walls .",
    "most works on gws assume that the bubble walls propagate as jouguet detonations .",
    "in contrast , we have determined , as a function of the temperature , whether the walls propagate as subsonic or supersonic deflagrations , or as weak detonations .",
    "we have also taken into account the possibility that , instead of reaching a stationary state , the walls run away . in order to determine the hydrodynamic solution we have estimated the friction for each model , using approximations derived in refs .",
    "these approximations do not depend on details of the specific model and have the correct dependence on the relevant parameters ( e.g. the couplings of the extra particles with the higgs ) .",
    "thus , our wall velocity depends on the friction coefficient as well as on the thermodynamic parameters .",
    "furthermore , we have numerically evolved the phase transition from the nucleation of the first bubbles until the time of bubble percolation , taking into account the variation of the nucleation rate and of the wall velocity with temperature .",
    "we have also taken into account the fact that the nucleation rate is suppressed in the regions that are reheated by shock fronts .",
    "we accomplished this in a simple way by considering the fraction of volume occupied by `` shock front bubbles '' .",
    "the evolution of the phase transition was considered in some detail in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the latter studied an extension of the sm with extra scalars .",
    "however , only bubble collisions were considered as a source of gws .",
    "as we have seen , the signal from bubble collisions is generally much lower than that from turbulence ( at least for phase transitions which do not have runaway bubble walls ) .",
    "the work of ref .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , considered both signals from bubble collisions and turbulence , and models which , in principle , may give stronger phase transitions .",
    "however , the relevant size scale of the turbulence was assumed to correspond to the bubbles which maximize the volume distribution at the percolation time .",
    "in contrast , we have argued that the relevant wavelength is given by the size of the largest bubbles .",
    "we obtain a higher signal , since the intensity of the gws is higher for larger bubbles ( @xmath532 ) .",
    "as we have seen , the size of the largest bubbles can be approximated by @xmath533 , and there is an enhancement @xmath534 with respect to the size corresponding to maximum volume .",
    "it is clear that further investigation is needed in order to determine the spectrum of turbulence in the presence of several stirring scales ( in the case of a phase transition , a continuum of bubble sizes ) .    for most of the models and parameters ,",
    "the gravitational wave signal from the electroweak phase transition seems to be rather weak to be detected by lisa .",
    "nevertheless , extensions with scalar singlets which are strongly coupled to the higgs give considerably strong phase transitions , which produce gws with intensities as high as @xmath1 for frequencies @xmath535 .",
    "these models give a signal detectable by lisa , although some fine tuning of the parameters ( below the 1% level ) is required .",
    "taking into account that the sensitivity curves are only approximate , and that current calculations of gw generation and phase transition dynamics may have large errors , this fine tuning may be relaxed in the future .",
    "the extension of the sm with strongly coupled fermions gives weaker signals , which could be detected after a correlation analysis from bbo .",
    "for the case of the mssm , the ultimate sensitivity of decigo would be needed to detect gws from the electroweak phase transition .",
    "interestingly , the model with extra fermions gives a larger signal than the mssm , even though the wall velocity is smaller .",
    "this confirms the importance of taking into account the complete dynamics of the phase transition . to begin with ,",
    "the wall velocity is not directly related to the strength of the phase transition .",
    "for instance , two models may have the same amount of supercooling and quite different friction , thus giving different wall velocities .",
    "most importantly , the gw intensity further depends on the size of the largest bubbles , which is rather unpredictable without a careful analysis , due to the nontrivial dynamics of nucleation and reheating .",
    "thus , higher wall velocities do not always guarantee larger bubble radii .",
