    "these notes are writeups of three lectures delivered at the theoretical advanced study institute in boulder , colorado , in june 2012 .",
    "the aim of the lectures is to provide students who have little or no experience with jets with the basic concepts and tools needed to engage with the rapidly developing ideas concerning the use of jets in new physics searches at the lhc . a certain amount of familiarity with the structure of qcd , and in particular with qcd showers , is assumed .",
    "lecture one introduces sequential jet algorithms , and develops several main tools in substructure analyses using the boosted higgs as an example .",
    "lecture two delves further into jet grooming and jet shapes , and in lecture three we conclude with an overview of top tagging and bsm searches .",
    "to understand jet substructure and its applications , we must first begin by understanding jets .",
    "jets , together with parton distribution functions and factorization theorems , are the phenomenological tool that allow us to separate out the perturbatively describable hard interactions in proton - proton collisions , and thereby enable us to make quantitative predictions for events involving strongly interacting particles .",
    "jet cross - sections necessarily depend on the algorithm used to define a jet .",
    "there are many jet algorithms , each one with its own strengths and weaknesses .",
    "the first jet algorithm was developed for @xmath0 hadron events by sterman and weinberg in 1977 @xcite . in this algorithm events",
    "are declared to have two jets if all but a fraction @xmath1 of the total energy in the event can be contained within two cones of half - angle @xmath2 .",
    "that is , radiation off of one of the initial partons must be sufficiently hard , [ eq : eps ] e_rad > and at sufficiently wide angles from either of the other jets , [ eq : de ] _ min > for the radiation to be resolved as a separate jet .",
    "how many events have two jets and how many contain three or more obviously depends on the exact values chosen for @xmath3 and @xmath2 . for all",
    "sufficiently large @xmath4 and @xmath2 , the partonic cross - section for radiation of an extra parton into the region of phase space defined by eqs .",
    "[ eq : eps ] and [ eq : de ] is sufficiently isolated from the soft and collinear singular regions of phase space that rates and distributions can be calculated reliably in perturbation theory .",
    "of course , this is a partonic calculation , and to fully match the partonic picture onto reconstructed sprays of hadrons requires some additional theoretical machinery to describe such effects as ( for example ) hadronization . for our purposes , however , a parton shower picture will suffice .",
    "the sterman - weinberg algorithm is the ur - example of a _ cone _ algorithm .",
    "while cone algorithms present a very intuitive picture of parton radiation , they can be somewhat clumsy in practice , particularly as the number of jets increases , and they are not in active use in most experiments today .",
    "other algorithms can deal much more flexibly with high jet multiplicity .",
    "one such flexible algorithm is the jade algorithm , developed by the jade collaboration in the late 1980s , also for @xmath5 hadrons @xcite . here",
    ", jets are constructed by iteratively recombining final state particles .",
    "define a metric to measure the separation between final state particles @xmath6 and @xmath7 , [ eq : yjade ] y_ij , where @xmath8 is the total energy of the event .",
    "note that @xmath9 vanishes if either @xmath6 or @xmath7 is soft ( @xmath10 or @xmath11 ) , or if @xmath6 and @xmath7 are collinear ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "we can now construct jets using the following recipe :    * compute the interparticle distances @xmath9 for all particles in the final state , and find the pair @xmath13 with the minimum @xmath9 . * if this minimum @xmath14 for some fixed parameter @xmath15 , combine @xmath6 and @xmath16 into a new particle , and go back to the previous step . * if @xmath17 , declare all remaining particles to be jets .",
    "since clustering of particles proceeds from smaller values of @xmath9 to larger values , this recipe preferentially clusters particles that are probing the regions of phase space dominated by the soft and collinear singularities . in a sense",
    ", the algorithm is trying to combine hadrons into partons by making its best guess for the reconstructed parton shower .",
    "the jade algorithm has only one parameter , the separation cutoff @xmath15 , and clearly can handle different jet multiplicities in an efficient way by varying @xmath15 .",
    "it is the ur - example of a _ sequential recombination algorithm _ , and the ancestor of all jet algorithms in wide use at the lhc .",
    "the most direct descendent of the jade algorithm is the _",
    "@xmath18 algorithm _",
    "@xcite , which replaces the particle energy factor @xmath19 in the jade metric , eq .  [ eq : yjade ] , with the factor @xmath20 : y_ij = .",
    "[ eq : ktee ] this still ensures that the metric goes to zero when either @xmath21 or @xmath22 are soft , but has the advantage that the relative softness of a particle depends only on its own energy , and not that of the other particle in the pair .",
    "this fixes up a technical drawback to the jade algorithm , where @xmath23 allows two very soft particles to be combined even if they are at very wide angles from each other .",
    "using @xmath24 means soft particles will get preferentially clustered with nearby harder particles instead .    for small @xmath25 , the numerator of eq .",
    "[ eq : ktee ] can be written as simply @xmath26 , the transverse momentum of the softer particle relative to the harder particle  hence the name of the algorithm . in this form the metric",
    "is directly related to qcd splitting functions .    to create a version of the @xmath18 algorithm that can be used at hadron colliders , where the total energy @xmath27 is unknown , both the algorithm and the metric have to be adapted @xcite . in the metric , we simply use longitudinally boost - invariant quantities @xmath28 and @xmath29 instead of @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and let the metric become dimensionful , d_ij = . the angular parameter @xmath32 introduced here will replace @xmath15 as determining the cutoff for combining particles , as we will see .",
    "we need in addition to define the quantities d_ib = p_t , i^2 for each particle @xmath6 , since we need to also consider splittings from the beam .",
    "the recombination algorithm now works as follows :    * compute @xmath33 and @xmath34 for all particles in the final state , and find the minimum value . *",
    "if the minimum is a @xmath34 , declare particle @xmath6 a jet , remove it from the list , and go back to step one . *",
    "if the minimum is a @xmath35 , combine particles @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and go back to step one .",
    "* iterate until all particles have been declared jets .",
    "this algorithm is usually what is meant by when the @xmath18 algorithm is referred to , but you may occasionally see it referred to as the _ inclusive _ @xmath18 algorithm , as there is a related ( _ `` exclusive '' _ ) variant @xcite .",
    "note that the parameter @xmath32 functions as an angular cut - off : two particles separated by a distance @xmath36 will never be combined , regardless of the @xmath28 s of the particles ( this does not necessarily preclude both particles being clustered into the same jet later ) .",
    "in fact , with this jet algorithm , arbitrarily soft particles can become jets .",
    "therefore jets are customarily returned down to some finite @xmath28 cutoff , typically tens of gev .    because the @xmath18 algorithm clusters particles beginning with soft particles and working its way up to harder particles , the algorithm tends to construct irregular jets which depend on the detailed distribution of soft particles in an event . for this reason ,",
    "@xmath18 jets are not especially practical for hadron colliders : irregular jets are hard to calibrate , and the jets are quite sensitive to unrelated radiation in the event .",
    "other sequential algorithms are obtained by using different metrics .",
    "the _ cambridge - aachen _ or c - a algorithm is obtained by taking @xcite d_ij = , d_ib = 1 . this metric clusters particles based only on their angular separation , giving a nicely geometric interpretation of jets .",
    "the c - a algorithm still reflects aspects of the qcd parton shower , in particular the _ angular ordering _ of emissions .",
    "however , it is less directly related to the structure of qcd parton splitting functions than the @xmath18 algorithm is , and represents a compromise between reflecting the structure of the parton shower and maintaining some insensitivity to soft radiation .",
    "algorithm entirely abandons the idea of mimicking the parton shower @xcite . here , the metric is d_ij = ( , ) , d_ib = . with this metric",
    ", particles are clustered beginning with the _ hardest _ particles .",
    "this means that the most energetic cores of jets are found first . as soft particles clustered later",
    "have a minimal impact on the larger four - momentum of the jet core , the anti-@xmath18 algorithm tends to cluster particles out to distances @xmath32 from the core of a jet , yielding very regular jets .",
    "anti-@xmath18 jets are therefore much easier to calibrate at experiments , and the anti-@xmath18 algorithm has become the default used at the lhc .",
    "let us conclude this section by emphasizing that all sequential jet algorithms return not only a list of jets but a _ clustering sequence _ for the event . varying the radial parameter @xmath37 simply acts to move the resolution scale up and down the clustering sequence , making it very easy to study how jet distributions and multiplicities depend on the angular resolution @xmath32 . in particular , for the c - a algorithm , the cluster sequence regarded as a function of @xmath32 has a purely geometric interpretation as resolving the event on different angular scales .",
    "all three sequential jet algorithms discussed here also share the same _ reach _ , that is , regardless of the chosen metric , a splitting @xmath38 will not be combined if the angular distance between the daughters exceeds the chosen jet radius , @xmath39 .",
    "this means that , to leading order , perturbative computations of quantities such as jet rates are identical between all three algorithms .    finally , the infrared and collinear safety of all three sequential jet algorithms can be easily checked by asking how the cluster sequence would change with the addition of a soft or collinear emission .",
    "for the shower - sensitive @xmath18 and c - a metrics , infrared and collinear safety follows automatically .",
    "the anti-@xmath18 metric is also manifestly ir- and collinear - safe , as can be seen with a little more thought : anti-@xmath18 recombinations are clearly collinear - safe , since collinear splittings are combined near the beginning of the sequence .",
    "ir safety also follows , as soft radiation has negligible impact on the jet built out from the hard core .",
    "the main subject of these lectures are the possibilities and uses of jets to discover physics at and beyond the electroweak scale , which means , for practical purposes , at the lhc .",
    "it is important to remember that events at lhc are a busy hadronic environment .",
    "in addition to the showering and hadronizing hard partons which we want to study , there are large amounts of soft , unassociated radiation from ( 1 ) the _ underlying event _ , that is , the remnants of the scattering protons ; ( 2 ) possible _ multiple interactions _ , that is , additional collisions of partons arising from the same @xmath40-@xmath40 collision as the hard interaction ; and ( 3 ) _ pile - up _ , additional @xmath40-@xmath40 collisions from other protons in the colliding bunches .",
    "these additional sources of radiation contribute a potentially sizable and largely uniform backdrop of hadronic activity that , when clustered into jets , will partially obscure the features of the hard interaction that we would like to reconstruct .",
    "the default jets used at the lhc are formed using the anti-@xmath18 algorithm , with cone sizes @xmath41 ( at atlas ) and @xmath42 ( at cms ) .",
    "these specific choices of @xmath32 come from a compromise between ( 1 ) the desire to collect all the radiation from a single parton , and ( 2 ) the desire _ not _ to sweep up an excessive amount of unrelated radiation .",
    "many advances have combined to make jets at the lhc a particularly fertile field .",
    "* _ advances in experiment _ : the calorimeters at atlas and cms have much finer resolution than in previous experiments , allowing a much more finely grained picture of events . moreover , _ local _ calibration of jets allows jets to be considered on multiple scales . * _ advances in computation _ : the development of fast algorithms @xcite allows broad implementation of sequential recombination . * _ advances in energy _ :",
    "the lhc center of mass energy is large enough that particles with weak scale masses ( i.e. , @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) will for the first time have an appreciable cross - section to be produced with enough of a boost to collimate the daughter partons . the simple picture that one parton corresponds to one jet breaks down badly in this case , and new tools are needed to separate out collimated perturbative decays from qcd showers .",
    "there are several reasons to be interested in boosted particles . very often , there is theoretical motivation to focus on a particular slice of phase space where the daughter particles are necessarily boosted .",
    "high mass resonances are the simplest such examples . for instance , a resonance @xmath45 with mass @xmath46 tev which decays to pairs of gauge bosons would yield highly boosted @xmath47 pairs .    even in the absence of a resonance or other mechanism to preferentially populate boosted regions of phase space , looking for boosted signals can also be useful for improving the signal to background ratio . changing the reconstruction method changes what the experimental definition of the signal is , and therefore necessarily the backgrounds change as well . this can sometimes  but not always!be enough of an advantage to make up for the reduction in signal rate that comes from selecting only the boosted region of phase space .",
    "background reduction comes in two forms . in high multiplicity final states ,",
    "combinatoric background is often prohibitive .",
    "when some or all of the final state particles are boosted , the combinatoric background is greatly reduced .",
    "but it is also possible to use boosted selection techniques to identify regions where the background from other physics processes is intrinsically reduced .    to appreciate the need for new reconstruction techniques at the lhc ,",
    "consider the production of top quarks at fixed center of mass energy @xmath48 .",
    "choosing some angular scale @xmath49 , we can ask , what fraction of top quarks have all three , only two , or none of their partonic daughters isolated from the others at the scale @xmath49 ? this gives a zeroth order estimate of how well a jet algorithm with @xmath50 will be able to reconstruct the three partonic top daughters as separate jets .",
    "the answer we get depends sensitively on both @xmath49 and @xmath48 :    .resolved parton multiplicities in @xmath51 events [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     clearly , tops produced in the very interesting super - tev regime @xmath52 tev straddle the borderlines between several different topologies",
    ". it would be much more desirable to have a flexible reconstruction method that could handle semi - collimated tops in a unified way .    to see how we can go about building such reconstruction techniques ,",
    "let s start by considering one of the landmark jet substructure analyses : the case of a boosted higgs decaying into @xmath53 .",
    "this analysis will introduce us to several ideas that will be important tools in our boosted analysis toolbox : fat jets , jet mass , jet grooming , and sequential de - clustering .",
    "searching for the higgs in its decay to @xmath54 is very difficult at the lhc , due to overwhelming qcd backgrounds . even in associated production ,",
    "@xmath55 , the background processes @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and even @xmath51 are overwhelming .",
    "nonetheless , thanks to ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath58 is now an active search channel at the lhc .    to be specific ,",
    "let s consider the process @xmath59 , followed by @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "the traditional approach to this signal would be to look for final states with a leptonic @xmath62 and 2 @xmath63-tagged jets , construct the invariant mass of the jets , and look for a peak in the distribution of @xmath64 .",
    "the new approach is instead to focus on events where the higgs is produced with substantial @xmath28 , @xmath65 gev , and cluster these events with a large ( @xmath66 ) jet radius , such that all of the higgs decay products are swept up in a single fat jet .",
    "the signal is now a leptonic @xmath62 + a fat `` higgs - like '' jet , and the background to this signal is now @xmath67 one fat jet rather than @xmath56 .",
    "what we ll see is that jet substructure offers us enough quantitative precision in what we mean by a `` higgs - like '' jet to reduce the background by an extent that makes up for the acceptance price demanded by the high @xmath28 cut .    for an unboosted search ,",
    "the ultimate discriminator between signal and background is the @xmath63-@xmath68 invariant mass : to find a resonance , look for a bump in the @xmath63-@xmath68 mass spectrum .",
    "now that we have boosted the higgs and collected it into a single fat jet , the higgs mass should be reflected in the invariant mass of the fat jet itself . to understand jet masses for the background , let s take a quick look at how jet masses are generated in qcd .",
    "[ [ jet - mass ] ] jet mass + + + + + + + +    .",
    "partons are generally massless ( we will neglect the @xmath63 quark mass ) , but jets are not .",
    "jet mass in qcd arises from emission during the parton shower , and as such we can calculate the leading contribution .",
    "jet mass , like most perturbative jet properties in qcd , is dominated by the first emission .",
    "let s consider for concreteness a quark emitting a gluon , and work in the collinear regime ( small @xmath32 ) . in this approximation , we can consider the jet in isolation from the rest of the event , neglecting interference and splash - in , and we can approximate the qcd splitting functions with the singular portions . doing so",
    ", the amplitude to radiate an extra parton can be written as d_n + 1 d_n dz p ( z ) , where @xmath69 is the virtuality of the parent @xmath70 , @xmath71 is the fraction of the parent energy retained by the daughter quark , and the splitting function @xmath72 for @xmath73 is given by ( z ) = c_f .",
    "the parent virtuality @xmath69 is of course the jet mass - squared . in the collinear limit , t = e_p^2 z ( 1-z ) ^2 = ( p_t , p ) ^2 z(1-z)^ 2 . integrating over rapidity",

    "this is where the choice of jet algorithm enters . as established above , for all sequential jet algorithms , only radiation at angles smaller than @xmath32",
    "will be clustered into the jet .",
    "strictly , we should use a running @xmath75 evaluated at a scale set by the relative transverse momentum of the splitting , but to get a quick estimate , let s perform the integral in the approximation that @xmath75 is constant .",
    "we then obtain m^2 c_f p_t^2 r^2 .",
    "the jet mass scales like @xmath28 , as it had to , and is suppressed by @xmath76 . to this order",
    "the mass increases linearly with @xmath32 .",
    "the exact value of the numerical coefficient will in general depend on the quark versus gluon content of the jet sample .",
    "for instance , the major qcd background for a doubly @xmath63-tagged boosted higgs comes from the splittings @xmath77 , where the splitting function is ( z ) = c_a ( z^2+(1-z)^2 ) , giving , in the constant-@xmath75 approximation , m^2 c_a p_t^2 r^2 .",

    "in other words , the probability of a qcd jet making a large jump in mass at a branching falls off as @xmath89 .. ]    we have now identified two ways in which a higgs boson @xmath44 decaying perturbatively to @xmath54 will behave very differently from a qcd parton branching : the splitting will be symmetric , and show a sudden drop in parton mass . the search algorithm for finding a boosted higgs looks for a splitting inside the higgs jet that behaves like a perturbative decay , and works as follows :    * cluster the event on a large angular scale ( ref .",

    "if the splitting fails to be sufficiently hard and symmetric , discard the softer of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and continue to unwind the harder . *",
    "continue until either an interesting splitting has been found or you run out of jet .",
    "this procedure , often referred to as the `` splitting '' or `` mass - drop '' procedure , identifies an interesting higgs - like splitting @xmath95 , which determines a characteristic angular scale @xmath96 for a particular event .",
    "once this scale @xmath97 has been identified , we benefit greatly by using smaller scales to resolve the event , rather than the large @xmath90 scale we started with .",
    "the reason is the following : starting with such a large jet , we are guaranteed to sweep up a large amount of unassociated radiation along with the higgs decay products .",
    "the effect of this unassociated radiation is to smear out the mass resolution .",
    "the invariant mass is especially vulnerable to distortion from even soft unassociated radiation , because evaluating @xmath98 depends on large cancellations .",
    "the amount of distortion scales like _ soft p_t , j r^3 , in the approximation that unassociated radiation contributes a constant energy @xmath99 per unit rapidity : the jet area scales like @xmath100 , while the incremental contribution to the invariant mass from a soft particle at distance @xmath101 from the jet core contributes as @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "so to recover mass resolution , it is vital to whittle down our initial fat jet to jets only as big as necessary to capture the radiation from the higgs decay products .",
    "in fact , we have already started whittling .",
    "the splitting procedure discards soft , wide - angle radiation clustered into the jet on its way towards finding the higgs - like splitting .",
    "this by itself helps to clean up the mass resolution .",

    ", we will proceed in the next section to discuss more ideas for cleaning up pileup , and more jet properties which can discriminate signals from qcd backgrounds .",
    "our last section concluded with a walk - through of the pioneering boosted higgs study , where we saw examples of two topics we will be discussing in this lecture , namely jet grooming and jet shapes .      in the boosted higgs analysis discussed in the previous lecture",
    ", we saw that jet mass resolution was badly degraded by the presence of unassociated radiation in the jet , and introduced the process of _ filtering _ to mitigate these contributions .",

    "the @xmath18 algorithm was originally proposed here because it increases the chances that soft fsr will be kept : since clustering in the @xmath18 metric works from soft up , using @xmath18 increases the chance that a relatively soft parton emitted in the parton shower will be reconstructed and pass above the @xmath28 threshold .",

    "we define the energy sharing variables z_ij= where in the last step we have taken the collinear limit ( and @xmath210 ) .",
    "notice that by performing this change of variables we have removed sensitivity to the collinear singularity , so that @xmath211 is only capturing information about the soft singularity .",
    "meanwhile , jet invariant masses still retain information about the relative angles between the jets , so the correlation between the variables has been reduced .",
    "the final set of variables that make up the atlas top tagger is then :    * the total jet mass , @xmath212 .",
    "the tagger requires @xmath213 gev , and no upper bound : no grooming procedure is used , so the mass spectrum is distorted upwards . * the variable @xmath214 , defined as the minimum pair invariant mass of the three subjets identified at the splitting scale @xmath207 .",
    "this is the equivalent to cutting on the minimum pair invariant mass in the cms tagger ; only the method of finding the subjets is different .",
    "we require @xmath215 gev . *",
    "all three energy sharing variables , @xmath216 , @xmath217 , and @xmath218 , which are subject to numerical cuts .",
    "we turn now to the heidelberg - eugene - paris top tagger , which functions on tops with @xmath219 gev @xcite . in some sense",
    "this algorithm is more of an event reconstruction strategy than a top tagger .",
    "the algorithm begins by clustering the event using c - a on the extremely large angular scale @xmath220 , and requiring the fat jets thus formed to have @xmath221 gev .",
    "the @xmath28 cut of 200 gev puts us in the regime where the top is sufficiently boosted that its decay products will frequently lie in a single hemisphere . looking at extremely fat jets is effectively identifying hemispheres in an event while avoiding the need to set any fixed angular scales for resolution within those hemispheres .",
    "this is an effective strategy for tops in this intermediate kinematic regime , where events will straddle any fixed angular scale ; by unwinding c - a hemispheres , we allow the angular scales to be flexibly identified event by event .    the next step is to unwind the fat jet looking for interesting hard structure .",
    "this is done by employing a ( loose ) mass - drop criterion . for a splitting @xmath121 , with @xmath222 ,",
    "the splitting is deemed sufficiently interesting if [ eq : hepsplit ] m_j > 0.2 m_p .",
    "if the splitting passes this criterion , retain both @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the list of jets to unwind ; otherwise , discard @xmath7 and keep unwinding @xmath6 until @xmath223 gev , at which point the unwinding stops .",
    "this unwinding procedure is performed on all subjets identified as interesting via eq .",
    "[ eq : hepsplit ] .",
    "the output of this step is a list of subjets @xmath224 resulting from this iterative declustering ; if there are at least 3 such subjets , then we have found enough substructure to continue .    at the next stage , we _ filter _ the substructures to shrink the geometric area associated with the top daughters and thereby reduce sensitivity to pileup , etc .",
    "unlike in the higgs case , where the mass drop criterion identified a unique angular scale @xmath96 associated with the sole hard splitting , we have a more complicated set of jets with more than one interesting splitting , and it is not immediately obvious which angular scale should be used to filter the event .",
    "the hep top tagger determines the filter radius @xmath225 by brute force , as follows . for each possible",
    "set of three subjets that can be drawn from the @xmath224 , filter them by resolving the constituents of those subjets with radius @xmath226 , and retain up to five subjets .",
    "let @xmath227 be the invariant mass of these up - to - five filtered subjets , and select the set with @xmath212 closest to @xmath161 as the top candidate .",
    "these up - to - five filtered subjets are then ( yet again ) reclustered into three subjets , which are the candidates for the partonic top daughters .",
    "the next step is to test whether or not the reconstructed top daughters have top - like kinematics .",
    "again , we will exploit the presence of both the top and @xmath159 mass scales .",
    "we have already used @xmath161 to identify the best set of subjets . unlike in the previous taggers",
    ", we will now demand evidence of the on - shell @xmath159 in a more complex way .",
    "label the three subjets returned by the previous step as @xmath228 in descending order of @xmath28 .",
    "of the three invariant masses @xmath229 , @xmath230 , and @xmath231 , only two are independent .",
    "this means that the top kinematics is characterized by a specific distribution in the two - dimensional space determined by the pair invariant masses .",
    "top jets are focused into a thin triangular annulus in this space , as two subjets reconstruct an on - shell @xmath159 ( the annulus is triangular since any of the @xmath232 may correspond to the @xmath159 ) .",
    "background , by contrast , is concentrated in regions of small pairwise invariant masses .",
    "the kinematic cuts imposed in the hep top tagger pick out this top - like triangular annulus by asking that events lie on one of the three branches of the annulus .     of each other",
    "( blue , dashed ) ; all top decay products clustered into @xmath233 c - a fat jets ( purple , dotted ) ; tagged by the hep top tagger ( red , solid ) ; tagged , but with reconstructed subjects not matching original partons ( green , dot - dashed ) .",
    "data from ref .",
    "@xcite.,width=408 ]    to understand how well this procedure covers the interpolating kinematic region , we plot efficiencies for tops to pass through these steps in fig .  [",
    "fig : heptop ] . as is evident from the blue ( dashed ) curve , simply demanding that all decay products of the top lie in a single hemisphere imposes a non - negligible acceptance price for tops at the low end of the @xmath28 range , which drops quickly as the tops become more energetic .",
    "further demanding that the top daughters all be clustered into the same fat jet results in an additional mild efficiency loss , seen in the purple ( dotted ) curve .",
    "the purple curve is the fraction of tops giving rise to taggable jets ( neglecting the possibility of mistagged signal ) .",
    "the red line denotes the final efficiency of the full hep top tagger , after the filtering and kinematic cuts . at low @xmath28 ,",
    "the fraction of taggable jets which are in fact tagged is near unity , but as the tops become more collimated , the probability of a taggable jet passing the kinematic cuts falls off , in large part because collimation and jet - particle misassignment make the @xmath159 mass reconstruction less precise . at the upper end of the @xmath28 range shown in the figure , the high-@xmath28 top taggers are useful , and would take over .",
    "let us also comment that there is a possibility for tops to pass the top tagger by accident , when the algorithm picks up the wrong set of jets ; this is shown in the green ( dot - dashed ) curve .      as we saw in section",
    "[ sec : shapesub ] , @xmath143-subjettiness offers an entirely complementary test of the existence of hard substructure .",
    "a simple and highly effective top tagger can be constructed using as input variables just the jet mass and the ratio @xmath234 .",
    "further refinement is possible with a multivariate analysis which uses in addition @xmath170 as well as @xmath235 and @xmath236 individually @xcite .    from our experience with the previous taggers , we can guess that even further improvement would be possible if some information about the @xmath159 were also incorporated ; since the @xmath143-subjettiness jet shape also provides a method of determining subjet axes , it naturally suggests methods for defining three subjets and computing the analog of @xmath214 . to the best of the author s knowledge , no such study has been publicly performed .",
    "let us now consider the performance of the top taggers which we have discussed .",
    "this task is made easier by the work performed in the boost 2010 @xcite and boost 2011 @xcite workshops , which compared the performance of different top taggers on the same reference sets of event samples .",
    "these event samples are publicly available online , so should you develop your own brilliant ideas about top tagging , you can cross - check the performance of your novel technique with the techniques already in the literature . in fig .  [",
    "fig : eff1 ] we show performance curves for the high-@xmath28 top taggers which we discussed above .     in the boost 2010 reference samples for : atlas ( blue , dotted ) ;",
    "cms ( red , dashed ) ; and @xmath143-subjettiness in both the simple ( green , solid ) and multivariate ( green , dot - dashed ) versions .",
    "data from refs .",
    "@xcite.,width=384 ]    overall , these high-@xmath28 top taggers have efficiencies on the order of @xmath237 , at a ( qcd ) background mistag rate of @xmath238 .",
    "( for comparison , lhc @xmath63-tagging algorithms achieve @xmath239 , with a fake rate @xmath240 . )",
    "it is evident from the performance curves that the atlas tagger outperforms the cms tagger when high signal efficiency is required , while cms does better at lower signal efficiency .",
    "even the simple two - variable @xmath143-subjettiness tagger outperforms both cms and atlas taggers by a notable margin , except at high signal efficiency , while adding the additional multivariate discrimination to the @xmath143-subjettiness tagger provides a significant improvement .",
    "further updates in the boost 2011 workshop show that ( 1 ) being more precise about modeling qcd radiation at wide angles and ( 2 ) including the effects of finite detector resolution reduce typical efficiencies to @xmath241 , at a ( qcd ) background mistag rate in the range @xmath242 depending on the tagger @xcite . incorporating",
    "finite detector resolution also tends to reduce ( but not erase ! ) the relative advantage of @xmath143-subjettiness over the sequential decomposition - based taggers .",
    "new physics produces jets with substructure when the kinematics are governed by a nontrivial hierarchy of scales .",
    "for the top examples we ve been discussing , this hierarchy arises from the separation between the scale characterizing new physics and the electroweak scale : _ np _ ew _ qcd .",
    "the little hierarchy problem results in a very strong motivation for developing tagging techniques for boosted sm objects . besides the top tagging discussed in the previous subsection",
    ", much effort has also gone into tagging boosted @xmath159 , @xmath62 , and @xmath44 bosons arising from the decay of new tev - scale particles@xcite .",
    "this is fortunate for theorists , as , once these techniques are put into use at experiments in one context , the barrier is much lower for their adaptation in other contexts where the theoretical motivation may not be so universal .",
    "what other kinds of bsm physics are amenable to substructure analyses ? to engender events with interesting substructure , some multi - tiered hierarchy of scales is required .",
    "we will enumerate an illustrative but far from exhaustive set of examples .",
    "supersymmetry is one example of a new physics sector which naturally can generate multiple scales .",
    "for example , if supersymmetry is broken at very high scales , rg effects will drive the colored superpartners much heavier than those superpartners with only ew charges .",
    "thus , at the weak scale one could naturally expect @xmath243 . in the presence of a large hierarchy between gluino and neutralino",
    ", the decay products of the neutralino would be collimated .",
    "let us further suppose that the neutralino decays via the @xmath32-parity violating @xmath244 superpotential operator , so that @xmath245",
    ". then gluino pair production would appear as a six - jet final state , where two of the jets are actually boosted neutralinos , containing interesting substructure @xcite .",
    "the very large particle content of the mssm can easily accommodate many possible hierarchies , with different theoretical origins ; see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite for another of the many possibilities .",
    "another way to generate a hierarchy in a bsm sector is if the new physics sector contains a broken global symmetry , so that the scale @xmath246 characterizing the lightest states is set by the magnitude of the global symmetry breaking , rather than by the overall scale of the new sector , @xmath247 .",
    "thus consider , for example , a composite rho @xmath45 , decaying into two pseudo - nambu - goldstone bosons @xmath248 , which are stable within their own sector , and therefore must subsequently decay into sm objects @xcite .",
    "hidden valley models also have this kind of multi - scale structure . here",
    "the hierarchy is between the mass of the mediator which connects the visible and hidden sectors and the mass scale of the light states in the hidden sector , _ med _ np > _ sm .",
    "the mediating particle might be a sm particle , in particular the @xmath44 or @xmath62 , or a novel field such as a @xmath249 @xcite or the sm lsp @xcite .",
    "exotic higgs decays to light particles also fall under this umbrella @xcite .",
    "more generally , thinking more broadly and flexibly about jets leads to new approaches to combinatorics and event reconstruction @xcite , and provides novel methods to distinguish qcd events from new physics . as challenging",
    "high - multiplicity and all - hadronic final states become a larger component of the lhc program , flexible and creative jet techniques will be critical to our ability to discover and interpret the physics .",
    "jet algorithms themselves are still an evolving field ! the anti-@xmath18 algorithm was introduced only a few years ago .",
    "as the nature of the questions that we ask about jets evolves , so do the best jet algorithms to address these questions .",
    "there is still a lot of room for new ideas !",
    "references which were invaluable in the preparation of these lectures are the text _ qcd and collider physics _ , by ellis , stirling , and webber @xcite , and the lecture notes `` toward jetography '' by salam @xcite .",
    "the proceedings of the boost 2010 and 2011 workshops @xcite are valuable resources for those looking for a quantitative survey of both theoretical and experimental progress in jet physics at the tevatron and the lhc .",
