    "optical polarimetry provides a unique view into the surface albedo , roughness , and composition of asteroids .",
    "the majority of polarimetric studies monitor polarization as a function of sun - asteroid - observer phase angle @xmath11 . due to the geometry of main belt asteroid orbits as seen from earth , it is generally difficult to observe asteroids with @xmath12 . for @xmath13 , coherent backscattering from rough",
    "regolith causes linear polarization parallel to the scattering plane ( so - called  negative branch polarization \" ) , rather than perpendicular as for rayleigh scattering ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this effect is also observed in mercury , the moon , and mars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "fortuitously , the transition between negative and positive branch polarization may be observed from earth for most asteroids , and the maximum absolute polarization in the negative branch @xmath14 , inversion phase angle @xmath15 , and polarimetric slope @xmath16 at the inversion phase angle allow differentiation between classes of asteroids ( e.g. , @xcite ) . + less well - studied is rotational modulation in polarized light .",
    "while asteroid rotation may be readily apparent in photometry , polarimetric amplitudes are decreased and correspondingly difficult to measure .",
    "the highest significance detection of polarimetric rotational modulation is currently from asteroid ( 4 ) vesta , due to its striking albedo heterogeneity @xcite .",
    "since asteroidal polarization and albedo are generally anticorrelated ( umov effect ) , anticorrelation of simultaneous photometry and polarimetry suggests that surface roughness and composition are spatially homogeneous .",
    "however , departures from the umov effect suggest that surface roughness and/or composition are heterogeneous . thus , expansion of polarimetric rotational modulation detections will greatly improve understanding of asteroidal surface properties . for vesta , the _ dawn mission _",
    "has provided high spatial resolution maps @xcite , which allows unprecedented comparison of polarimetry with surface features . +",
    "successful observations of polarimetric rotational modulation of vesta have been performed at phase angles near @xmath14 , and rotation is observed to produce peak - to - peak @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "since @xmath18 @xcite , rotational modulation presents a peak - to - peak polarimetric modulation of @xmath19 . as this is near the accuracy limit of conventional , waveplate polarimeters , other detections are few and at low snr ( e.g. , ( 7 ) iris : @xcite , ( 16 ) psyche : @xcite , and ( 1943 ) anteros : @xcite ) . +",
    "while optical circular polarization of mercury , venus , earth s twilight sky , the moon , mars , jupiter , saturn , and comets has been detected , asteroids are conspicuously absent from the list @xcite .",
    "since asteroids tend to be fainter than solar system planets , the combination of relatively large telescopes and highly accurate polarimeters is needed for detection of circular polarization .",
    "we discuss simultaneous linear and circular polarimetric observations of asteroid vesta with the polish2 polarimeter at the lick observatory 3-m telescope on a single night .",
    "this instrument , primarily designed to search for scattered light from spatially unresolvable exoplanets , routinely reaches polarimetric sensitivity of order @xmath20 ( ppm ) on naked - eye stars .",
    "polish2 ( polarimeter at lick for inclination studies of hot jupiters 2 ) is a dual photoelastic modulator ( pem ) polarimeter mounted at straight cassegrain focus of the lick observatory shane 3-m telescope .",
    "downstream of the telescope secondary , two hinds instruments fused silica pems ( i / fs40 and i / fs50 ) are located to minimize instrumental polarization .",
    "the compression / extension axis of the first pem is oriented parallel to celestial north ( @xmath21 ) , while the second pem is oriented northwest ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "acoustic resonance in the pems is induced , and their stress birefringence simultaneously modulates incident linear and circular polarization .",
    "therefore , each stokes parameter ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath2 ) is modulated at specific frequencies .",
    "+ downstream of the pems is a filter wheel with bessell @xmath23 filters .",
    "instrumental polarization due to the filters is discussed later in this section .",
    "next , a two - wedge wollaston prism bifurcates the beam into opposite linear polarization states , where polarization incident on the pems is ac coupled into an intensity modulation .",
    "both modeling and telescope flat - field lamp observations show that polarization is modulated at sum and difference linear combinations of the pem fundamental frequencies ( @xmath24 khz , @xmath25 khz ) .",
    "indeed , stokes @xmath8 is modulated primarily at 100 khz , @xmath9 at 10 and 90 khz , and @xmath2 at 30 , 50 , and 130 khz . +",
    "both wollaston output beams are focused at @xmath26 diameter field stops and field lenses , and light is detected by hamamatsu h10721 - 110 sel photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) .",
    "a pair of stanford research sr570 current preamplifiers converts the current output of the pmts into a voltage that is digitized by a national instruments pxie-6124 analog to digital converter .",
    "square wave voltage outputs from both pem controllers are simultaneously digitized by this device , and the fundamental frequencies and phases of both pems are precisely measured in each 5 second data file .",
    "this allows frequent , precise knowledge of the modulation frequencies .",
    "+ since polish2 is an ac - coupled polarimeter , a lock - in amplifier approach is taken in software @xcite . briefly , both a sine and cosine are constructed for each modulation frequency , and the product of these sinusoids with mean - subtracted , raw data from each pmt are calculated over 0.1 second data segments .",
    "the time average of each product is then taken , which removes the contribution of raw data varying at frequencies other than the modulation frequency .",

    "<S> we measure the peak - to - peak modulation in degree of linear polarization to be @xmath3 ( ppm ) and time - averaged @xmath4 . after rotating the plane of linear polarization to the scattering plane </S>",
    "<S> , asteroidal rotational modulation is detected with @xmath5 confidence and observed solely in stokes @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> polish2 simultaneously measures stokes @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ( linear polarization ) , and @xmath2 ( circular polarization ) , but we detect no significant circular polarization with a @xmath10 upper limit of 140 ppm in @xmath1 band . </S>",
    "<S> circular polarization is expected to arise from multiple scattering of sunlight by rough surfaces , and it has previously been detected in nearly all other classes of solar system bodies save asteroids . </S>",
    "<S> subsequent observations may be compared with surface albedo maps from the _ dawn mission _ , which may allow identification of compositional variation across the asteroidal surface . </S>",
    "<S> these results demonstrate the high accuracy achieved by polish2 at the lick 3-m telescope , which is designed to directly detect scattered light from spatially unresolvable exoplanets . </S>"
