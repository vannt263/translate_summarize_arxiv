    "<S> . therefore once @xmath3 clifford tori are desingularized along @xmath19 , there are two ways of desingularizing the tori along @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> thus we obtain the second type(even ) of minimal surfaces desingularizing @xmath3 clifford tori for each genus @xmath24 ( theorem 2 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> all the embedded minimal surfaces constructed by lawson , karcher - pinkall - sterling , kapouleas - yang satisfy the reflection symmetry , i.e. , they are invariant under a reflection across a great sphere in @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> but our new minimal surfaces have no reflection symmetry . </S>"
