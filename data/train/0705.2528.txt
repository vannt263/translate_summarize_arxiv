    "in the @xmath12-dominated cold dark matter ( cdm ) model , galaxies form via a process of hierarchical merging , in which more massive objects are assembled gradually via mergers of increasingly more massive subunits at progressively lower redshifts ( see @xcite for an introduction ) .",
    "observations of the merger rate of galaxies and its evolution with redshift provide important benchmarks for comparison with theoretical predictions , according to which massive galaxies have undergone several mergers between @xmath13 and the present epoch , doubling their mass over the last half of the hubble time @xcite .    unfortunately , it is generally difficult to ascertain observationally if two galaxies are going to merge in the near future , or if and when a galaxy last experienced a merger .",
    "galaxies undergoing mergers or interactions may exhibit peculiar morphological disturbances , such as tidal tails @xcite , while merger remnants may also show relic structures from their previous interactions , such as shells or ripples @xcite . a more quantitative version of this approach measures the asymmetry of a galaxy s light distribution to identify interacting systems and merger remnants and estimate the galaxy merger rate , e.g.  using the cas system ( bershady , jangren & conselice 2000 , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "before galaxies merge they will be distinct systems with some radial velocity difference and projected separation on the sky from which a merger time - scale can be calculated based on dynamical friction arguments .",
    "galaxy pair statistics therefore could , in principle , provide a powerful probe of mergers and their frequency . with modern imaging and spectroscopic surveys",
    "it is now possible to select pairs of galaxies which are not only close on the sky , but also at very similar redshifts , and are therefore more likely to be gravitationally bound .",
    "such objects are referred to as ` dynamically close pairs ' . the mathematical formalism to measure the close pair fraction and to derive the merger rate from it was developed by @xcite for the second southern sky redshift survey and @xcite for the canadian network for observational cosmology 2 ( cnoc2 ) survey and later applied to deep2 @xcite and the mgc @xcite .",
    "both of these latter studies found a low local merger rate , suggesting that only a small fraction of massive galaxies are formed by major mergers at @xmath14 .",
    "there are therefore two methods for observationally measuring the merger history  finding galaxies in pairs that will eventually merge , and locating highly asymmetric galaxies .",
    "neither of these two approaches is free from ambiguity however .",
    "for example , not all close galaxy pairs will be dynamically bound and result in mergers .",
    "the observational problem is that it is impossible to constrain the projected relative motion of the two members of a close pair or to precisely determine the radial distance between them .",
    "@xcite estimate that close pair samples may suffer from contamination by as many as @xmath15% unphysical pairs ( superpositions ) .    on the other hand , not all asymmetric galaxies are imminent or recent major mergers , as it is possible to induce significant asymmetries by other means ( e.g. , interactions , star formation , minor mergers , etc .",
    " see , e.g. , conselice , bershady & jangren 2000a ) .",
    "care must therefore be taken when selecting mergers based on asymmetry @xcite .",
    "the two techniques  asymmetry and close pairs  are also likely to probe different stages of a merger : @xcite suggest that galaxy morphology is very robust , and that significant asymmetries are induced only by a close interaction .",
    "furthermore , n - body simulations indicate that a merger remnant may remain significantly asymmetric for an extended period after the merger event @xcite .",
    "hence asymmetry is likely to probe the immediate pre - merger and an extended post - merger phase .",
    "in contrast , galaxy pairs will select all stages of the pre - merger phase except the very last , where the two galaxies can no longer be identified unambiguously as individual objects in the imaging data .",
    "it is important to understand how galaxy pairs and asymmetric galaxies measure the merger process because , for observational reasons , the two methods are preferentially employed in different redshift regimes . at high redshift ,",
    "highly complete spectroscopic samples are difficult to obtain whereas relatively high resolution imaging is available from hst .",
    "hence selection by asymmetry is often the method of choice in this regime ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at low redshift , the situation is essentially reversed so that the pair method is preferred ( e.g. * ?",
    "we clearly require a cross - calibration of the two methods on the same dataset before drawing reliable conclusions regarding the evolution of the merger rate at high and low redshifts .",
    "in this paper we attempt to deliver this cross - calibration by searching for dynamically close pairs of galaxies and measuring the structural asymmetries on the same sample of objects .",
    "we then determine if paired galaxies are asymmetric , and also how the merger fractions and rates derived from both methods compare .",
    "a few questions we address include : are galaxies in close pairs more asymmetric than isolated galaxies ? does the degree of disturbance correlate with pair separation ?",
    "are more asymmetric galaxies more likely to lie in pairs , with the most asymmetric ones in closer systems ? what is the distribution of galaxy asymmetries for the local universe ?",
    "are there isolated galaxies with high asymmetry , and are these merger remnants ?",
    "@xcite carried out a similar study by comparing the asymmetries of isolated galaxies and those in close pairs , taken from the cnoc2 redshift survey , using hubble space telescope snapshots of close pair candidates and a small sample of isolated cnoc2 galaxies falling within the hst field of view . for these galaxies , they measure asymmetries using the @xmath16 index of @xcite .",
    "galaxies in cnoc2 pairs are more asymmetric than isolated ones , but over only a limited range of pair separations ( up to @xmath17  kpc in projection ) set by the original pair selection by @xcite . @xcite",
    "have compared asymmetries in spiral - spiral pairs , ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( commonly regarded as interacting and/or merging systems ; @xcite ) and a local sample of objects from @xcite , showing that asymmetry increases with decreasing pair separation , although the samples were somewhat heterogeneous .",
    "to measure the merger rate from asymmetry _ and _ dynamically close pairs requires a dataset with both high - quality imaging _ and _ very complete redshift information .",
    "the millennium galaxy catalogue ( mgc ; @xcite ) is particularly well - suited to this task .",
    "the mgc consists of deep ccd imaging of a long , thin ( @xmath18 ) equatorial strip , reaching to @xmath19  mag and @xmath20  mag arcsec@xmath21 , and coinciding with both the 2df galaxy redshift survey northern strip ( 2dfgrs ; @xcite ) and with the sloan digital sky survey data release 1 region ( sdss ; @xcite ) .",
    "the mgc also includes a parallel redshift survey , reaching @xmath22% completeness at @xmath23  mag and @xmath24% at @xmath25  mag @xcite .    because of its homogeneous high - quality imaging , its large , contiguous field of view , and high redshift completeness",
    ", the mgc enables one to compute the merger rate from the statistics of dynamically close pairs @xcite _ and _ galaxy asymmetries .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to carry out a comparison of these two approaches using the same , homogeneous , sample of galaxies .",
    "as in previous mgc papers , we adopt a cosmology with @xmath26 , @xmath27 and calculate all distances with reference to @xmath28  km  s@xmath10  mpc@xmath10 .",
    "in order to compare asymmetries and close pairs as indicators of the merger rate , we first select a volume - limited sample of galaxies from the mgc .",
    "this sample includes @xmath29 galaxies with @xmath30  mag , @xmath31  mag and @xmath32 .",
    "these limits are shown in figure  [ selection ] . from this sample",
    "we extract close pairs with projected separations of up to @xmath33 kpc and isolated galaxies ( i.e. , with no companion within the specified magnitude and redshift limits and projected separation criteria ) .",
    "we also compute asymmetries for all galaxies in the volume - limited sample . because of the absolute magnitude range considered",
    ", we can identify mergers with a luminosity ratio of up to @xmath34 for the brighter galaxies ( @xmath35 mag . ) , with the sample becoming more incomplete for fainter galaxies .",
    "the range in luminosity ratios that can be explored biases the sample towards pairs with nearly equal luminosities .",
    "we identify dynamically close pairs using the above sample in the same way as @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , we consider a wider range of projected separations than @xcite because of our wider angular coverage and more complete spectroscopy .",
    "two galaxies in our sample form a dynamically close pair if their projected separation is less than @xmath33  kpc , and their velocity difference is less than @xmath36  km  s@xmath10 .",
    "we consider only the _ closest _ companion ( multiplets are ignored ) and galaxies with no such companion are regarded as isolated for our purposes .",
    "the above criteria for position and velocity separation were chosen as follows .",
    "the pairwise velocity dispersion of 2df galaxies is @xmath37  km  s@xmath10 @xcite ; therefore objects with larger velocity separations are unlikely to be bound ( see also figure  4 in @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , simulations show that pairs with larger velocity separations are unlikely to merge ( carlberg , pritchet & infante 1994 ) , while a velocity separation of @xmath36  km  s@xmath10 is generally larger than the internal velocity dispersion of the galaxies under study , which decreases the likelihood of a significant interaction @xcite .",
    "simulations also show that galaxies with similar masses , and with a projected separation of less than @xmath38  kpc are likely to merge within @xmath39  gyr @xcite .",
    "the upper limit on the projected separation we adopt in this paper ( @xmath40  kpc ) is arbitrary , but it should isolate all objects likely to merge in the near future , as well as those where the interaction has induced significant asymmetry ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "it is of course possible that we miss some companions due to our incomplete redshift coverage .",
    "there are @xmath41 @xmath30  mag galaxies ( 4% of all @xmath30 systems ) in the mgc for which we have not obtained a redshift .",
    "we use the projected separation criterion to calculate whether any of these galaxies could be the closest companion to a galaxy in the volume - limited sample .",
    "if so , we assume that the galaxy without redshift has the same redshift and @xmath42-correction as its putative companion , and require that it obeys the absolute magnitude cuts to be part of the volume - limited sample .",
    "objects in the sample for which the closest companion may be one of the @xmath41 galaxies without redshifts are however not included in our analysis .",
    "this decreases our sample to @xmath0 galaxies from the original @xmath29 .",
    "this contains @xmath43 galaxies in pairs with projected separation of less than @xmath38  kpc , and @xmath44 isolated galaxies . while all pairs within the specified luminosity and redshift limits are included , the sample is incomplete towards pairs with large luminosity differences and tends to be more complete for pairs of nearly equal luminosities .",
    "the median magnitude difference for the above 112 pairs is @xmath45 mag .",
    ", equivalent to a typical 1:2 luminosity ratio ( i.e. , we primarily measure major mergers ) .",
    "asymmetries for galaxies within the volume - limited sample are calculated using both the @xmath16 index of @xcite and the more recent cas indices of @xcite , which have been calibrated on local galaxy samples to identify merger remnants .",
    "the details on how to calculate the asymmetries used in this paper are given in @xcite and @xcite , for the @xmath16 method , and @xcite for the revised cas indices .",
    "the cas ( concentration , asymmetry , clumpiness ) parameters are a non - parametric method for measuring the structures of galaxies resolved on ccd images .",
    "one particular feature of this system is that galaxies with extremely high asymmetries , usually @xmath46 , are likely to be in a major ( post-)merger phase .",
    "this has been calibrated with asymmetry measurements of nearby and distant normal and merging galaxies @xcite , and of ` galaxies ' seen in n - body merger simulations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , conselice , bershady & gallagher ( 2000b ) have shown that galaxy mergers have both high asymmetries and high hi line width asymmetries .",
    "our method for computing the cas parameters is slightly different from that in previous works . because we are examining nearby bright galaxies in a general field survey ,",
    "our sample was not specifically selected to be clean of foreground and background contamination .",
    "our sample therefore represents a more generalised case for measuring asymmetries in field surveys of nearby galaxies . for each galaxy",
    "we use a sextractor @xcite segmentation map to replace all nearby objects with the sky , using the same noise properties as measured directly from the background . in this way",
    "we eliminate the possible contamination of the asymmetry measurement by these objects .",
    "this method is however not always perfect when there are very nearby bright stars or large galaxies .",
    "we must therefore keep in mind that any sample of highly asymmetric galaxies may be contaminated by galaxies that have an intrinsically low asymmetry , but whose asymmetry measurement was corrupted by a nearby object .",
    "figure  [ asym_distr ] shows the distribution of asymmetries for both the @xcite and cas methods : we plot the fraction on the ordinate logarithmically , in order to emphasise the small number of more asymmetric galaxies .    for the @xmath16 index",
    "we find that the asymmetry distribution peaks at @xmath47 , with a long tail of more asymmetric objects .",
    "following the definitions of @xcite , ( @xmath48)% of galaxies are ` asymmetric ' ( @xmath49 ) and ( @xmath50)% are ` highly asymmetric ' ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "however , unlike the cas indices , @xmath16 has not been calibrated to specifically identify merging systems or merger remnants .",
    "visual examination of the @xmath52% most asymmetric objects ( by the @xmath16 criterion ) shows that about 1/3 are in close pairs , 1/3 seem to be merger remnants and the rest appear to be edge - on galaxies or classical irregulars and late - type spirals ( see also section below ) .",
    "among the close pairs with projected separation of less than @xmath53  kpc we find that ( @xmath54)% are ` asymmetric ' and ( @xmath55)% are ` highly asymmetric ' . the pair fractions and merging pair fractions ( assuming that 50% of the pairs actually merge ) are in good agreement with the values derived by @xcite , but we find a much larger fraction of asymmetric or highly asymmetric isolated galaxies .",
    "this is likely due to the relatively small sample of isolated galaxies in @xcite , the lower physical resolution of the comparatively shallow hst imaging used ( leading to a smoothing of the low surface brightness brightness asymmetric features ) , different isolation criteria used and treatment of segmentation maps .",
    "the cas method defines galaxies with @xmath46 as unusually asymmetric : @xcite suggest that such objects may be interpreted as merger remnants .",
    "the distribution of cas @xmath56 values in figure  [ asym_distr ] peaks at @xmath57 , suggesting that @xmath56 is sensitive to relatively minor deviations from symmetry .",
    "we find that ( @xmath58)% of our sample have @xmath46 with this blind selection . at face value , and assuming that @xmath15% of the close pairs ( with separation less than @xmath38  kpc ) merge , this is about a factor of two larger than the ` merging pair ' fraction .",
    "however , before we draw any conclusions regarding possible discrepancies between the two methods we will need to evaluate more carefully what types of objects have been selected by the @xmath46 cut .",
    "figure  [ comp ] compares asymmetry measurements for galaxies in various isolation classes ( from close pairs to galaxies we regard as being isolated ) for both cas @xmath56 and @xmath16 and shows the limits used to distinguish asymmetric or highly asymmetric galaxies for both methods .",
    "not surprisingly , @xmath16 thresholds appears to be considerably less stringent than cas @xmath56 , although there is a broad relation between the two indices .",
    "one can see that there are several galaxies in close pairs with separations less than @xmath59 kpc above the @xmath60 line , as well as numerous isolated galaxies , while only a few pairs with larger separation have high cas asymmetry .",
    "there are numerous objects deemed as highly asymmetric by the @xmath16 index , but with @xmath61 . in most cases ,",
    "these are edge - on or late - type spirals which have not been decontaminated from the sample as we do for the high @xmath56 systems .      a blind study such as this requires that we examine by eye those systems which are asymmetric .",
    "there are two reasons why one should not simply assume that _ all _ mgc galaxies with @xmath46 are imminent mergers or merger remnants .",
    "first of all , as pointed out in section [ asym ] , the sample may contain objects whose asymmetry measurements have been corrupted by nearby bright / large objects .",
    "secondly , the @xmath56 value of @xmath62 @xcite was established using the sample of normal nearby galaxies of @xcite and a collection of starburst galaxies , which were selected to span a large range of morphological types . in contrast , here we are using a volume - limited sample .",
    "also , although the cas @xmath56 is reasonably robust , it does depend on the physical resolution of the data @xcite .",
    "therefore we have visually examined all @xmath63 galaxies with @xmath46 in our sample and classified them into the following categories :    * likely merger remnants : although this is a somewhat subjective classification , these objects appear to be relatively obvious ` trainwrecks ' or very disturbed disks with multiple , similarly bright light components .",
    "we find @xmath64 objects in this category , and we show mgc postage stamp images of these galaxies in figure  [ mmr ] . * likely imminent mergers : these are disturbed galaxies similar in appearance to the above , but satisfying two additional requirements : ( i ) they are a member of a close pair as identified above , i.e.  have a ` major ' companion ; ( ii ) they show evidence of interaction with their companion .",
    "we find @xmath65 such objects and show their images in figure  [ imm ] .",
    "the projected separation to the companion , @xmath66 , in this sample ranges from @xmath67 to @xmath68  kpc . * other : there are 8 galaxies that are not imminent mergers and whose asymmetry measurements are not contaminated ( see below ) .",
    "however , 4 of these galaxies are faint and/or low surface brightness objects which we can not reliably classify , and all of these look unusual and could be merger remnants .",
    "in contrast , the other 4 galaxies in this category are most likely not recent merger remnants : one is a face - on disk , one is a spheroidal galaxy ( with some low - level debris nearby ) , and the other two are _ minor _ mergers ( as determined from the full mgc catalogue ) . * contaminated : galaxies where the asymmetry appears to be due to the presence of a bright star in the vicinity .",
    "@xmath69 galaxies are thus affected .",
    "furthermore , for 57 galaxies sextractctor did not construct correct segmentation maps , which led to erroneously high cas @xmath56 values .",
    "if these objects are ( wrongly ) included in the sample of highly asymmetric galaxies they account for 50% of the sample .",
    "hence , without paying particular attention to the construction of the segmentation maps , and/or visual vetting of the sample , a large fraction of @xmath46 galaxies turn out to be false positive mergers .    if we exclude objects with contaminated measurements and with bad segmentation maps , we find that @xmath70% of the asymmetric galaxies in our sample are obvious imminent or recent mergers .",
    "the status of the remainder is more uncertain .",
    "however of the remaining 8 systems , four are possible merger remnants .",
    "we note that over half of all systems initially found with @xmath46 were contaminated by stars , or were over - segmented .",
    "this demonstrates that vetting of asymmetry selected merger samples is advisable ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "although contamination by stars is less of a problem at high redshifts , where , presumably , the asymmetry index will be applied in future surveys , contamination by neighbouring unrelated galaxies may be an issue ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    as noted above , we found from our visual inspections that @xmath71 of our initial sample of @xmath46 galaxies were asymmetric due to sextractor having produced bad segmentation maps for these objects .",
    "most of these were late - type , face - on or edge - on spirals with prominent star - forming regions and/or spiral arms , and sextractor falsely separated these into multiple sources .",
    "as noted in section 2.3 , the cas code attempts to avoid the corruption of a galaxy s cas parameters through nearby objects by replacing these with blank sky . in the case of the shredded galaxies this procedure created ` holes ' in their light distribution and hence artificially high asymmetries . to deal with this",
    "we re - ran the cas code on all galaxies without using any segmentation maps at all .",
    "each galaxy was then assigned the smaller @xmath56 value from the two runs , and @xmath71 galaxies went from @xmath46 to @xmath72 .    hence , in order to avoid significant contamination of high - asymmetry samples with late - type disks in future large surveys ( where visual inspection will be unfeasible ) , care must be taken when constructing the segmentation maps and/or when masking neighbouring objects .",
    "figure  [ asym_pair ] shows the values of @xmath16 and cas @xmath56 for galaxies in pairs , plotted against the projected separation of the pair members .",
    "galaxies in pairs with @xmath73  kpc clearly show an excess asymmetry over galaxies in pairs with wider separations .",
    "this appears to confirm the findings of @xcite and @xcite that being in a close pair induces asymmetries ( via tidal stresses and star formation ) .",
    "hence there is no doubt that at least a fraction of the close pairs consist of physically bound objects undergoing an interaction .",
    "[ asym_pair ]    in order to show this more clearly we plot the fraction of ` asymmetric ' galaxies vs.  pair separation for five @xmath38  kpc wide bins of projected separation in figure  [ asym_frac ] .",
    "we also indicate the fraction of asymmetric galaxies ( according to both methods ) among the isolated galaxies .",
    "the fraction of asymmetric galaxies increases with decreasing pair separation , consistent with the interpretation that closer pairs result in a progressively stronger interaction .",
    "we also compare the cumulative distribution of asymmetries for the five projected separation bins used above , and for isolated galaxies in figure  [ asym_distr_d ] .",
    "as implied by figures  [ asym_pair ] and [ asym_frac ] , we see an excess of asymmetric galaxies over the distribution for isolated galaxies only in the two lowest separation bins .",
    "however , in the smallest separation bin , there is an excess fraction of asymmetric galaxies even at the highest asymmetries .",
    "this implies that , at least in the closer pairs , we are witnessing a significant degree of morphological disturbance .     +    while these figures show that @xmath16 is also capable of identifying mergers and merger remnants , this index has not been calibrated with the same thoroughness as the cas index , where extensive work has been carried out by conselice and collaborators .",
    "for this reason , from now on , we use the cas index exclusively to derive the merger rate and compare to the pair fractions .    by comparing the differential cas @xmath56 distribution of isolated galaxies with that of galaxies in close pairs with @xmath74  kpc",
    "we can derive a limit on the fraction , @xmath75 , of unphysical pairs in this sample .",
    "for our purposes , we assume ( or define ) galaxies in ` unphysical ' pairs to be those that have the same @xmath56 distribution as isolated galaxies .",
    "this calculation will give us therefore a lower limit on the fraction of paired galaxies that are in interacting systems .",
    "we denote the normalised differential @xmath56 distribution of isolated galaxies by @xmath76 , and the unknown distribution of galaxies in true , physical pairs as @xmath77 .",
    "hence the normalised @xmath56 distribution of _ all _ apparent galaxy pairs with @xmath74  kpc can be written as : @xmath78 .",
    "since @xmath75 must lie in the range @xmath79 and since @xmath80 for all @xmath56 , we find that @xmath81 must hold for all @xmath56 . by comparing the observed distributions @xmath82 and @xmath76",
    "we find that the maximum value of @xmath75 for which this condition still holds is @xmath83 , where this constraint is driven by the low-@xmath56 end of the distributions ( @xmath84 ) as expected . in other words , of all galaxies in dynamically close pairs with",
    "@xmath74  kpc at least @xmath85% lie in physical pairs .",
    "this compares well with the fraction of @xmath15% estimated by @xcite , and we will use this number in the following calculations .",
    "we are now in a position to calculate the merger time - scale and fraction for close pairs and asymmetry - selected galaxies , and compare the lifetime of the merger remnant to the merger time - scale for the progenitor pair .",
    "in section [ asymps ] we found that only pairs with small separation ( @xmath73  kpc ) are likely to merge within a short time interval , and that among these the majority of likely mergers are found among pairs with @xmath86  kpc ( based on the presence of asymmetries as an indicator of an on - going interaction ) . to a first approximation the close pair fraction for these latter objects can give a measure of the merger rate .",
    "we find that the pair fraction is ( @xmath87)% . in order to correct for pairs which are missed because of redshift incompleteness we adopt the @xmath88 incompleteness correction calculated by @xcite for mgc close pairs with @xmath74  kpc , yielding a close pair fraction of ( @xmath58)% . assuming that @xmath15% of these close pairs are likely to be physical pairs and hence future mergers , we derive a merger fraction of ( @xmath89)% for our volume - limited sample .    in section [ natasym ] we found that high asymmetry identifies both merger remnants and to a lesser extent future mergers .",
    "to derive a merger fraction that is directly comparable to the one derived from the close pairs above ( which is essentially a ` progenitor galaxy ' fraction ) , we must take into account that each merger remnant was produced by ( at least ) two progenitor galaxies and hence count it twice .",
    "in addition we apply the above incompleteness correction to the @xmath90 objects in pairs with @xmath74  kpc .",
    "this yields a galaxy merger fraction of ( @xmath91)% .",
    "the similarity between the merger fractions derived by these two methods suggests that the total time - scale for asymmetry ( i.e.including the pre - merger phase ) is similar to the merger time - scale of a @xmath74  kpc pair .",
    "we can determine the pre- and post - merger fraction of the total asymmetry time by comparing the number of imminent mergers ( corrected for redshift incompleteness ) with the number of merger remnants ( @xmath92 ) identified by asymmetry .",
    "we deduce that the pre - merger phase takes up @xmath93% of the total asymmetry time , consistent with results derived from n - body simulations ( conselice 2006 ) .",
    "we notice , however , that there are several galaxies in pairs with @xmath46 that have large separations ( some as large as 34 @xmath4 kpc ) .",
    "it is likely that these objects are on parabolic or hyperbolic orbits or may not merge until after several more passages .",
    "the general picture that emerges from these results is the following : close pair selection ( with @xmath74  kpc ) is sensitive to most stages of the ` pre - merger ' . from dynamical friction considerations ( see equation 7 in @xcite )",
    "we find that the merger time - scale for a ` typical ' close pair in our sample , with average separation of @xmath94  kpc and average velocity separation of @xmath95  km  s@xmath10 is about @xmath96  gyr .",
    "being in a close ( physical ) pair enhances asymmetry and during the last @xmath97% ( or @xmath98  myr ) of this pre - merger phase the asymmetry has become so significant that the imminent merger is selected by the @xmath46 cut .",
    "the total asymmetry time is much longer than this because the remnant remains asymmetric for @xmath99  gyr after the two systems merge , and the new system dynamically relaxes @xcite .",
    "hence , as implied by n - body simulations , asymmetry identifies the immediate pre - merger stage as well as an extended post - merger phase . while the absolute time - scales above are quite uncertain their ratios are not , but are fixed by our results , i.e. , if the merger time - scale is revised to @xmath39  gyr then the asymmetry time - scales must also change accordingly .",
    "a comparison with theoretical predictions is somewhat difficult , as there may not be a one - to - one correspondence between galaxies and their host dark haloes ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . with this caveat ,",
    "@xcite predict a merger rate of @xmath100 mergers per gyr for massive galaxies with mass ratio 1:1 to 1:3 . from our data",
    "we find that @xmath101% of the mgc pairs consist of galaxies within this mass ratio , yielding a pair fraction of @xmath102 .",
    "the merger rate we derive is marginally consistent with the above prediction for a merger time - scale of @xmath96  gyr or too low by a factor of @xmath103 for a time - scale of @xmath39  gyr , similar to the comparison shown by bell et al .",
    "( 2006  their figure 2 ) from theoretical models .",
    "the merger rate we derive , following equation 3 of @xcite , is @xmath104 @xmath105 mpc@xmath9 gyr@xmath10 . strictly speaking",
    "this is a lower limit , as some pairs are certainly missed , but it should be a fair estimate of the major merger rate for nearly equal luminosity pairs , which are less incomplete . for comparison ,",
    "@xcite derive an average merger rate of @xmath106 at @xmath107 for galaxies with @xmath108 , which is about one order of magnitude lower than that derived by @xcite , but in good agreement with our @xmath109 value .",
    "it is much larger , by almost two order of magnitude , than the merger rate between luminous red galaxies at @xmath110 measured by @xcite , suggesting that the majority of mergers between galaxies in the @xmath111 universe are not ` dry ' ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "our results are consistent with a flat evolution of the merger rate , i.e. , as @xmath112 @xcite rather than the @xmath113 dependence expected from cdm models ( @xcite , but see discussion by @xcite ) .",
    "if the merger rate evolution is flat out to @xmath11 only a small fraction of massive galaxies can have formed via major mergers in the last 1/2 of the hubble time .",
    "in this paper we have compared the close pair fraction and the fraction of asymmetric galaxies in a volume - limited sample of galaxies drawn from the mgc .",
    "our sample consists of @xmath0 galaxies between @xmath114  mag and @xmath32 .",
    "the main conclusions of this work are :    * the cas selection for mergers , @xmath46 , after correction for contamination , is highly successful at locating galaxies in major mergers with a corrected fraction of @xmath70% .",
