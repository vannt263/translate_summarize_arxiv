    "understanding the ground states of strongly correlated condensed matter systems is a central problem in computational physics .",
    "several approaches have had a degree of success in this endevour .",
    "these include various sophisticated quantum monte - carlo techniques for sampling the partition function @xmath3 of a system with hamiltonian @xmath4 at temperature @xmath5 , and using this sampling procedure to estimate the thermal expectation values of various operators @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "although these can be used for relatively large finite - size systems , they are intrinsically finite - temperature methods and accessing the very low temperature regime involves doing calculations at successively lower temperatures and then extrapolating .",
    "other approaches include various exact diagonalization techniques that obtain the lowest energy state in a given sector .",
    "these are severally constrained by memory requirements in terms of the system sizes they can handle .",
    "while this problem can be overcome in one dimension by the sophisticated density matrix renormalization group method  @xcite , there is as yet no generalization of this method that works equally well in higher dimension , although there has been considerable progress recently  @xcite .",
    "recently , sandvik and collaborators have developed an extremely elegant and sophisticated projection algorithm  @xcite that essentially solves the problem of calculating the ground state expectation values of quantities in a large class of @xmath7 antiferromagnetic spin systems which have ground state in the total spin @xmath8 singlet sector .",
    "this singlet sector algorithm works in the ` bipartite valence - bond ' basis for singlet states ( see below ) , and exploits the over - completeness of this basis to develop a procedure  @xcite for evaluating the expectation values of some observables @xmath9 in the ( unnormalized ) ground state @xmath10 obtained by acting on an arbitrary singlet state @xmath11 with a large power of @xmath12 .",
    "the key to its success is an extremely efficient  @xcite procedure for stochastically sampling @xmath13 , which allows one to handle large systems with as many as @xmath14 spins in favorable cases .",
    "the ground state spin of a finite system made up of spin - half variables interacting antiferromagnetically naturally depends on the nature of the finite sample : if the total number of spin - half variables is even , one expects a ground state in the singlet sector , while systems with an odd number of spins will have a ground state in the total spin @xmath15 sector .",
    "for instance , an @xmath16 square lattice heisenberg antiferromagnet with periodic boundary conditions and @xmath2 even will have a singlet ground state , while the same magnet with @xmath2 odd and free boundaries will have a ground state spin of @xmath17 .",
    "in many situations , it is useful to be able to handle both kinds of finite systems .",
    "for instance , if one wants to model experiments that dope insulating antiferromagnets with non - magnetic ions like zn  @xcite that substitute for the magnetic moments , it is convenient to study @xmath1 periodic systems with @xmath2 even as before , but with one spin removed from the system to model the missing - spin defect introduced by zn doping .",
    "the original valence - bond projector loop algorithm  @xcite allows one to study the singlet sector ground states of systems with an even number of spins . here",
    "we ask if it is possible to come up with an analogous procedure in the total spin @xmath17 sector of systems with an odd number of spins in order to compute properties of the @xmath0 doublet ground state of antiferromagnetic systems with an odd number of spin - half variables interacting antiferromagnetically .",
    "as our results demonstrate , the answer turns out to be very satisfying : using a judiciously chosen basis for the @xmath17 sector of such systems , we find that is indeed possible to construct an analogous procedure that works as well in the total spin @xmath0 sector as the original singlet sector algorithm of sandvik and collaborators  @xcite . here",
    "we detail several aspects of this generalization .",
    "to illustrate the power of the method , we also show results for the ground state ` spin texture ' in the @xmath18 ground state of an @xmath1 square lattice @xmath7 heisenberg antiferromagnet with open boundary conditions and @xmath2 odd and as large as @xmath19 .",
    "a judicious choice of basis is the key to generalizing the original singlet sector valence - bond projector loop qmc algorithm to the study of bipartite spin - half antiferromagnets with @xmath20 b - sublattice sites , @xmath21 a - sublattice sites , and a doublet ground state in the @xmath17 sector .",
    "while other choices may also be possible , we find it convenient to use the basis @xmath22,[{\\mathcal a}(b_2 ) b_2]\\dots [ { \\mathcal a}(b_{n_b})];a_{f}\\sigma \\rangle \\right\\ } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] each member of this basis has one @xmath23-sublattice spin @xmath24 in either the @xmath25 or the @xmath26 state along the quantization axis @xmath27 , while the @xmath20 spins @xmath28 on the @xmath29-sublattice sites each form a singlet state ( ` valence - bond ' ) @xmath30 with a partner @xmath31 on the @xmath23-sublattice .",
    "all basis states are obtained by allowing all possible @xmath32 , two choices for @xmath33 , and all possible ` matching ' functions @xmath34 consistent with a given choice of ` free spin ' @xmath32 .",
    "note that this basis set is actually a union of two distinct basis sets @xmath35,[{\\mathcal a}(b_2 ) b_2]\\dots [ { \\mathcal a}(b_{n_b})];a_{f}\\uparrow \\rangle \\right\\ } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath36,[{\\mathcal a}(b_2 ) b_2]\\dots [ { \\mathcal a}(b_{n_b})];a_{f } \\downarrow \\rangle \\right\\ } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] corresponding to the two allowed choices for the conserved quantum number @xmath37 in the @xmath17 sector of an @xmath38 invariant composed of an odd number of spin-1/2s .",
    "this basis is ( over-)complete in a manner entirely analogous to the bipartite valence - bond basis that was used in the original singlet sector algorithm  @xcite .",
    "this may be seen as follows : consider adding one extra @xmath29-sublattice site @xmath39 to our system to make the total number of spins even .",
    "the singlet sector of this larger system is spanned by the ( over-)complete bipartite valence bond basis .",
    "states in this basis are in one - to - one correspondence with possible pair - wise matchings @xmath40 that ` find ' a @xmath23-sublattice ` partner ' @xmath41 for each @xmath29-sublattice site @xmath42 to form a singlet : @xmath43 with the @xmath17 states of the smaller system .",
    "therefore , to check for ( over-)completeness of our proposed basis for the smaller system , we only need to check whether all states in the bipartite valence bond basis of the larger system are obtainable as tensor products of states of the additional spin @xmath44 with states in our proposed @xmath17 basis .",
    "this is certainly the case , as is readily seen by identifying @xmath32 with @xmath45 and @xmath34 with the restriction of @xmath40 to the domain @xmath46 .",
    "our proposed basis is thus overcomplete in a manner entirely analogous to the original bipartite valence bond basis for the singlet sector .    in practice , for @xmath38",
    "symmetric spin hamiltonians of interest to us here , we will additionally exploit the conservation of the @xmath47 component of spin and restrict attention to the basis @xmath48,[{\\mathcal a}(b_2 ) b_2]\\dots [ { \\mathcal a}(b_{n_b})];a_{f}\\uparrow \\rangle \\right\\}$ ] that only spans the @xmath18 sector a system with @xmath21 spin-1/2s on the @xmath23-sublattice , and @xmath20 spin-1/2s on the @xmath29 sublattice .",
    "we now indicate the changes that arise in the formulae for the wavefunction overlaps between basis states , and for the action of exchange operators when working in the @xmath17 sector . as is well - known , the wavefunction overlap between two bipartite vb basis states @xmath49 and @xmath50 of the singlet - sector basis are determined by the number of cycles needed to go from the permutation @xmath40 to the permutation @xmath51 .",
    "more pictorially , one may consider the overlap diagram of the two valence - bond covers viewed as ` complete dimer covers ' or ` perfect ' matchings .",
    "this overlap diagram contains @xmath52 ( closed ) loops of various lengths @xmath53 , such that each site is part of exactly one loop ( see fig  [ rules1 ] ) . knowing this overlap diagram",
    ", one may calculate the corresponding wavefunction overlap to be @xmath54 , where @xmath55 , the total number of spins is assumed even .",
    "generalizing this to states in our basis for the @xmath17 sector , we note that the corresponding picture is now terms of the overlap diagram of two _ partial valence bond covers _",
    "@xmath56 and @xmath57 , each of which leaves one site free ( uncovered by a valence bond ) .",
    "such an overlap diagram necessarily involves exactly one ` open string ' of length @xmath58 connecting @xmath32 to @xmath59 , in addition to @xmath52 ( closed ) loops of various lengths @xmath60 ( see fig  [ rules1 ] ) .",
    "an elementary calculation reveals that the wavefunction overlap in our @xmath17 case is given as @xmath61 , with @xmath55 , the number of sites , now taken to be odd .",
    "the original singlet sector algorithm relies heavily  @xcite on a particularly simple action of operators @xmath62 on basis states @xmath63 . here",
    "@xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) for @xmath66 belonging to the @xmath23-sublattice ( @xmath29-sublattice ) , and thus , the operator @xmath67 that connects an @xmath23-sublattice site @xmath68 to a @xmath29-sublattice site @xmath69 is precisely the projection operator that projects to the singlet state of the two spins @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "our key observation , which allows us to generalize this algorithm to the the @xmath17 case , is that the action of @xmath72 on states in our @xmath17 basis remains simple .",
    "this is seen as follows : if neither @xmath66 nor @xmath73 correspond to the ` free ' spin , @xmath72 acts exactly as in the earlier singlet sector case ( fig  [ rules1](a , b ) ) :    @xmath74 ... \\ ; ; a_f \\uparrow\\rangle & = &      { p_{{\\mathcal a}(b_\\alpha ) b_\\beta } } | ... [{\\mathcal a}(b_\\alpha),b_\\alpha] ... [{\\mathcal a}(b_\\beta),b_\\beta] ... \\ ; ; a_f \\uparrow\\rangle & = &   \\frac{1}{2 } | ... [{\\mathcal a}(b_\\alpha),b_\\beta] ...",
    "[{\\mathcal a}(b_\\beta),b_\\alpha] ... \\ ; ; a_f \\uparrow\\rangle,\\\\ \\nonumber   { p_{{\\mathcal a}(b_\\alpha ) { \\mathcal a}(b_\\beta ) } }      { p_{b_\\alpha b_\\beta } } | ... [{\\mathcal a}(b_\\alpha),b_\\alpha] ... [{\\mathcal a}(b_\\beta),b_\\beta] ... \\ ; ; a_f \\uparrow\\rangle & = &   \\frac{1}{2 } | ... [{\\mathcal a}(b_\\alpha),b_\\beta] ... [{\\mathcal a}(b_\\beta),b_\\alpha] ... \\ ; ; a_f \\uparrow\\rangle.\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    on the other hand , if either @xmath66 or @xmath73 correspond to the free site @xmath32 , one can easily check that the following holds ( fig  [ rules1](c , d ) ) :    @xmath75 ... \\ ; ; a_f \\uparrow\\rangle & = & \\frac{1}{2}| ... [a_f , b_\\alpha] ... \\ ; ; { \\mathcal a}(b_\\alpha)\\uparrow\\rangle,\\\\ \\nonumber   { p_{a_f { \\mathcal a}(b_\\alpha})}| ... [{\\mathcal",
    "a}(b_\\alpha ) b_\\alpha] ... \\ ; ; a_f \\uparrow\\rangle & = & \\frac{1}{2}| ... [a_f , b_\\alpha ] ... \\ ; ; { \\mathcal a}(b_\\alpha)\\uparrow\\rangle.\\\\ \\label{reconnectionamplitude}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus @xmath72 either causes no change or rearranges exactly one pair of valence bonds to give a new basis state with amplitude @xmath76 , or reconnects one valence bond to move the free spin to give a new basis state , again with amplitude @xmath76 . the important thing to note is that these rules are in complete analogy to the original singlet sector case .    by analogy to the original singlet sector work  @xcite , this allows us to formulate a convenient prescription for the calculation of @xmath77 between two of our basis states by writing @xmath78 and developing rules for the weight @xmath79 by comparing the overlap diagram of @xmath80 and @xmath81 with the original overlap diagram of @xmath80 and @xmath82 : if the action of @xmath72 makes no changes in the original overlap diagram , @xmath83 .",
    "in addition , @xmath84 if a loop is split into two loops or the open string is split into one loop and another open string ; here , the factor of two comes from the fact that the number of loops in the overlap diagram increases by one , while the factor of half has its origins in the reconnection amplitude of one - half in eqn  [ reconnectionamplitude ] . on the other hand , if two loops fuse into one , or if the open string fuses with a loop to give a larger open string , then @xmath85 , where the first factor of half reflects the fact that the number of loops is reduced by one , while the second factor of one - half comes from the reconnection amplitude in eqn  [ reconnectionamplitude ] .",
    "these rules are tabulated in fig  [ pijrules ] , and the important thing to note is that the open string can be treated on equal footing with ( closed ) loops in all cases , allowing one to generalize the singlet sector rules directly to the @xmath86 sector case discussed here .",
    "with all of this in hand , it is now easy to see that the singlet sector algorithm of sandvik and collaborators  @xcite generalizes straightforwardly to the @xmath17 sector case for hamiltonians of the form @xmath87 , where each piece @xmath88 of the hamiltonian is a projector @xmath89 acting on bond @xmath90 connecting spins @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "we start with an arbitrary @xmath17 @xmath93 state @xmath94 , say @xmath95 . as in the original singlet sector algorithm",
    ", we wish to stochastically sample @xmath96 by sampling all possible operator strings @xmath97 in the decomposition of @xmath98 into a sum of products , with weight for each such string being proportional to @xmath99 . to do this ,",
    "one splits each @xmath100 into a term @xmath101 that is diagonal in the @xmath102 eigenbasis , and a term @xmath103 that is offdiagonal . in addition",
    ", one writes @xmath94 in this basis as @xmath104 . as in the original singlet sector case ,",
    "each term @xmath105 is generated by working in a ` spacetime ' loop representation and using a combination of ` diagonal updates ' in which some @xmath106 is moved to a different bond @xmath107 and ` loop updates ' whereby each space - time loop is flipped with probability half ; this loop update allows one to switch between diagonal and off - diagonal pieces of a given set of bond operators , while simultaneously sampling all possible spin configurations @xmath108 in the state at @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "the only difference with the original singlet sector case is that we now have _ precisely one open string in the space - time diagram _ , which connects the ` free spin at @xmath111 ' , _ i.e _ the unpaired spin in @xmath112 to the ` free spin at @xmath110 ' , _ i.e _ the unpaired spin in @xmath113 , and which _ can not be flipped _ , since the unpaired spins in all our @xmath17 , @xmath93 basis states have fixed @xmath47 projection of @xmath114 . finally , as in the singlet case , we can easily generalize this procedure to treat hamiltonians that also contain products @xmath115 of projectors @xmath116 acting on distinct bonds @xmath90 and @xmath117 of the lattice .     with corresponding values of @xmath118 ( defined in text ) given within parenthesis.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "as in the singlet sector case  @xcite , physical properties can be calculated by taking each space - time loop diagram generated by the algorithm and ` cutting it at @xmath119 ' to obtain the overlap diagram that represents the overlap of @xmath120 with @xmath121 .",
    "consider for instance the neel order parameter @xmath122 .",
    "clearly , @xmath123 .",
    "however , @xmath124 receives contributions from sites on the open string in the overlap diagram , since the open string , in contrast to ( closed ) loops , has only one orientation and therefore can not be flipped .",
    "more formally , we may write @xmath125 and note that @xmath126 if @xmath66 is part of the open string in the overlap diagram between @xmath127 and @xmath128 and @xmath129 otherwise .",
    "we thus find @xmath130 , where the angular brackets on the right denote the ensemble average over the ensemble of overlap diagrams generated by the modified @xmath131 sector algorithm outlined above .",
    "we now turn to @xmath132 . as noted earlier , whenever @xmath66 and @xmath73 are both in the open string or the same ( closed ) loop , the corresponding weight @xmath83 , while @xmath133 when @xmath66 and @xmath73 do not both belong to the open string or the same ( closed ) loop . for an overlap diagram with closed loops of lengths @xmath134 ( with @xmath135 ) and an open string of length @xmath136",
    ", the latter can occur in @xmath137 ways where the prime on the sum indicates that @xmath138 is disallowed , while the former can occur in @xmath139 ways .",
    "as in the singlet sector case , we thus obtain @xmath140 , where the angular brackets on the right indicate average over the ensemble of overlap diagrams generated by the algorithm .",
    "this reduces to @xmath141 where the angular brackets on the right again denote averaging over the ensemble of overlap diagrams generated by the algorithm , and the important thing to note is that this estimator treats the open string ( @xmath142 ) on the same footing as the closed loops ( @xmath143 ) .",
    "finally , we consider the ground state expectation value of the fourth power of the neel order parameter , _",
    "i.e _ @xmath144",
    ". to derive the estimator for this in the @xmath17 , @xmath145 , we follow sandvik and beach  @xcite , and write @xmath146 . as in ref  , we note that the estimator for this quantity differs from the square of the estimator for @xmath147 only when the action of @xmath72 ` interferes ' with the action of @xmath148 , _",
    "i.e _ when the actual weight @xmath149 differs from the product @xmath150 of the independent weights @xmath151 and @xmath152 ( defined analogously to @xmath79 ) . as in the singlet sector case , this happens only in the two cases shown in fig  [ ssssrules ] , where the difference @xmath118 has been tabulated .",
    "thus , the only new calculation needed is a count of the number of ways in which each of the cases fig  [ ssssrules ] ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , ( d ) arise , weighted by the corresponding values of @xmath118 .",
    "it is at this step that the open string needs to be treated separately , since we find that this count for a open string in fig  [ ssssrules ] ( c ) differs from the analogous count for a closed loop in fig  [ ssssrules ] ( a ) by precisely one : fig  [ ssssrules ] ( a ) can arise in @xmath153 ways , while fig  [ ssssrules ] ( c ) can arise in @xmath154 ways . on the other hand , both fig  [ ssssrules ] ( b ) and",
    "( d ) arise in precisely @xmath155 ways ( with @xmath156 ) for fig  [ ssssrules ] ( d ) .",
    "with all this in hand , we obtain @xmath157 which reduces to .",
    "@xmath158    again",
    ", the thing to note is that the presence of the open string only changes the estimator by an addition constant @xmath159 when compared to the corresponding expression in the singlet sector case  @xcite .     and energy to exact values as a function of projection length : for a @xmath160 open system ( top ) and a @xmath161 periodic system ( below).,title=\"fig : \" ]   and energy to exact values as a function of projection length : for a @xmath160 open system ( top ) and a @xmath161 periodic system ( below).,title=\"fig : \" ]     to the bulk value along a direction perpendicular to the boundary : negative differences from bulk value shown along a cut perpendicular to the boundary for various systemsizes .",
    "inset shows the @xmath162 texture on the a - sublattice sites along a diagonal and an edge of a @xmath163 system.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "by way of illustration , we show results for a @xmath164 square lattice heisenberg antiferromagnet with @xmath165 , @xmath166 odd and open boundary conditions , and for a @xmath1 square lattice heisenberg antiferromagnet with periodic boundary conditions and @xmath2 even , but with one site missing .    to benchmark the method , we first compare the results for @xmath167 , @xmath168 open boundary condition system and a @xmath169 period boundary condition system having one site missing with the corresponding exact diagonalization results . in fig  [ opensaturation ] , we show the dependence of the estimators for ground state energy , @xmath170 and @xmath171 as a function of the projection power @xmath172 ; this performance is comparable to the performance of the original algorithm in the singlet sector , and thus our modification provides a viable method to study antiferromagnets forced to have a @xmath17 ground state due to the nature of the finite sample .    with this in hand",
    ", we move on to some illustrative physics results . for purposes of illustration",
    ", we consider a large open boundary condition system with an odd number of sites . in fig  [ opensz ]",
    "shows the magnetization at all sites of a sublattice for a open system with sizes @xmath173 . as noted by metlitski and sachdev  @xcite ,",
    "the effect of the boundary is to decrease the sublattice magnetization near it which is then restored to its bulk value away from boundary in a power - law manner  @xcite .",
    "as demonstrated by ref  , this suppression goes away as a power law @xmath174 as a function of distance @xmath175 from the edge . using our method",
    ", we can directly calculate @xmath176 in an odd by odd square lattice . on general grounds ,",
    "one expects that @xmath177 will also obey this prediction of metlitski and sachdev , although this quantity is not directly related to the usual definition of the neel order parameter . with this in mind ,",
    "we compare our results with the predictions from ref  , and find extremely good agreement , pointing to the usefulness of our approach .",
