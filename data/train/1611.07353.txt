    "physics with slow neutrons at research reactors and spallation sources can hardly be imagined without devices for neutron transport .",
    "thanks to the invention of neutron guides @xcite intense beams have become available over @xmath0 metres away from a neutron moderator . as a result",
    ", many experiments can be performed simultaneously at a single source and well shielded against radiation backgrounds .",
    "the physical principle of a neutron guide is total reflection by a surface of a medium with a positive neutron optical potential . for neutrons with wavelength @xmath1",
    "this requires the normal component @xmath2 of the wave vector with modulus @xmath3 to stay below a critical value @xmath4 characteristic for the mirror material .",
    "nickel with natural isotopic composition is well suited , and enriched @xmath5ni even more so , for which @xmath6 is particularly large . for thermal and cold neutrons , @xmath7 corresponds to a small critical angle of reflection that is given by@xmath8this defines a `` mirror constant '' @xmath9 with value @xmath10 rad / nm for natural ni .",
    "advances in performance have been achieved with the so - called supermirror .",
    "this device relies on coherent wave superpositions in a superlattice formed by a sequence of bilayers of two materials with very different neutron optical potentials ( most often ni and ti ) @xcite .",
    "broad - band supermirrors became popular in neutron physics in the 1980 s soon after otto schrpf started a first large - scale production for a neutron scattering instrument with wide - angle polarisation analysis @xcite .",
    "an ideal device would extend by a factor @xmath11 the range @xmath12 for which reflection from a simple mirror made of natural ni is nearly lossless .",
    "correspondingly , the neutron flux at the end of a long supermirror guide would scale with @xmath13 as the solid angle increases . in real supermirrors , however , neutron losses occur due to roughness of the layer interfaces and due to absorption . for simulations of neutron transport efficiencies ,",
    "one usually describes their reflectivity by@xmath14which includes a linear drop from unity at @xmath15 down to a value @xmath16 at @xmath17 .",
    "commercially available supermirrors have reflectivity @xmath18 % at @xmath19 .",
    "hence , even if a neutron requires only a few reflections with @xmath20 in the range @xmath21 , its probability to arrive at the end of a long guide may be quite low .",
    "the concept of a ballistic neutron guide mitigates this problem mezei/1997 . here",
    ", the guide cross section first increases linearly with the distance from the source , then stays constant in a second and usually much longer section , and finally converges linearly back to its initial size .",
    "the corresponding phase space transformations of the beam reduce the total number of reflections .",
    "moreover , the reduced beam divergence in the straight guide section necessitates only a coating with lower @xmath11 which costs less and has a higher reflectivity of typically @xmath22 % at a standard @xmath23 .",
    "a ballistic guide was first implemented in the fundamental - physics beamline pf1b at the ill haese/2002,abele/2006 . in the meantime ,",
    "extensions of the concept have become popular , including parabolically and elliptically shaped guides schanzer/2004,kleno/2012 .",
    "it should be noted that neutron guides are not imaging devices and typically transport neutrons by many reflections .",
    "this contrasts with grazing - angle imaging systems that were first developed for x - rays , such as wolter optics which focus a parallel beam by double reflections off a parabolic mirror combined with a hyperbolic or elliptical one .",
    "such systems are also feasible for slow neutrons @xcite , for which a microscope based on three nested coaxial wolter mirrors has been demonstrated @xcite . here",
    "a mirror system is proposed for imaging neutrons under large solid angle from an extended neutron source or the end of a neutron guide onto a target area of similar size .",
    "based on single reflections , the imperfect mirror reflectivity in the range @xmath24 has a rather limited impact so that one may expect significant gains with respect to long guides .",
    "moreover , a well defined angle of incidence on every mirror surface element offers interesting new opportunities for tailoring and monochromation of primary beams .",
    "let us first recall mathematical properties of an elliptical mirror and point out why a long elliptical neutron guide is a non - imaging device",
    ". in a plane with cartesian coordinates @xmath25 and @xmath26,@xmath27describes an ellipse with long and short axes @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "the latter are related with the distance @xmath30 between the two focal points according to @xmath31it is well known that a single specular reflection off an ellipse maps a straight ray emitted in any direction from the first focal point m located at @xmath32 onto the second focal point m at @xmath33 . for cold neutrons with not excessively large wavelength , the maximum reflection angle @xmath34 does not exceed a few degrees even for a large-@xmath11 supermirror .",
    "elliptical neutron mirrors are therefore truncated to @xmath35 , and guides usually `` narrow '' ( @xmath36 ) and `` long '' ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "it is easy to see that for a long elliptical guide the mapping between focal points does not lead to an optical image of an extended source . as illustrated in fig .",
    "@xmath38 , a ray starting at @xmath39 with a lateral offset @xmath40 and reflected at a point @xmath41 arrives at @xmath42 with an offset of@xmath43a long mirror reflects within a wide range of @xmath44 and hence superposes images with widely varying magnifications @xmath45 .",
    "reflections at @xmath46 are focusing , @xmath47 , as shown for example with the reflection point @xmath48 .",
    "they lead to an increase of flux density at m. in the opposite case , @xmath49 [ e.g. , for reflection at @xmath50 , the mirror magnifies the source , thus reducing the corresponding flux density .",
    "the latter case represents a vast majority of neutrons in a long guide , because the ratio of ranges of unidimensional angular acceptance , @xmath51 , is usually much larger than unity and enters squared in the solid angle .",
    "the spatial intensity distribution at m thus becomes widened and the flux density reduced with respect to m. in addition , for a significant fraction of neutrons the magnification becomes so large that they impinge at least a second time on the mirror [ such as the ray from @xmath52 to @xmath53 .",
    "this leads not only to increased losses due to imperfect mirror reflectivity , but also to complex structures in the divergence distribution as observed in monte - carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "indeed , these authors concluded that `` transport of neutrons by realistic elliptic guides usually involves many reflections , contrary to the usual expectations '' .",
    "they also state that multiple reflections become increasingly common with increasing guide length . a mirror system based on single neutron reflections",
    "may therefore lead to improved beam transport efficiency .",
    "the next section discusses such a system .    ,",
    "for which the reflection angles are minimised and @xmath54.,scaledwidth=82.0% ]",
    "the proposed neutron optical system is shown in fig.@xmath55 .",
    "it consists of nested short elliptical mirrors with common length @xmath56 .",
    "they are located in the plane halfway between m and m which are the common focal points of all ellipses . a central absorber blocks the direct view from m to m. according to eq .",
    "[ magnification ] and in contrast to a single long mirror , one obtains a well - defined image at m which is weakly blurred due to magnifications being limited to a narrow range @xmath57 .",
    "focusing is also possible , by placing elliptical mirrors closer to the point m. however , this reduces the solid angle subtended from the point m. compared to a guide starting close to a source , mirrors situated at a large distance ( i.e. , @xmath58 ) are much less exposed to damaging radiation .",
    "a clear spatial separation from the source environment also facilitates independent maintenance of neutron - optical and in - pile components , including exchange of beam tubes .",
    "the mirror system may be implemented either with toroidal or with translational , `` planar '' symmetry . in the former case ,",
    "the device is rotationally symmetric about the @xmath25 axis ; each mirror surface is a section of an ellipsoid of revolution ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 in eq .",
    "[ ellipse ] are then taken as the axial and radial components in cylindrical coordinates , respectively ) .",
    "a single reflection transports a neutron from m to m. in the planar case , the mirrors have a local translational symmetry along the @xmath59 axis ( taken together with @xmath25 and @xmath26 as cartesian coordinates ) .",
    "neutrons undergo a single reflection with momentum transfer in the @xmath60 plane , but additional mirrors are needed to refocus or guide them in the orthogonal @xmath59 direction . for instance , adding a second planar multi - mirror optics rotated by @xmath61 degrees about the @xmath25 axis creates a `` double planar '' system in which two imaging reflections occur , one for each transverse dimension .",
    "in contrast to grazing - angle optics for x - rays , toroidal mirrors for imaging slow neutrons over long distances may exhibit significant chromatic aberrations due to gravity .",
    "these also occur in the aforementioned double planar system , obviously without affecting reflections on vertical mirrors .",
    "gravity has practically no relevant influence in a hybrid system consisting of planar multi - mirror optics combined with simple or ballistic reflective boundaries in the vertical dimension @xmath59 .",
    "these mirrors , projected onto the @xmath62 plane , must cover the whole area defined by the outermost rays in fig .",
    "hybrid systems seem best suited when a large beam divergence can be accepted only in one dimension .",
    "for instance , neutron scattering instruments possessing a detector array with high unidimensional angular resolution require a tight collimation within the scattering plane .",
    "an anisotropic beam divergence may also originate from the source due to moderator shape and/or geometrical constraints on beam tubes .",
    "another interesting application of hybrid systems is large - angle deviation of beams with low - to - medium divergence , given that space restrictions for instruments at reactor and spallation neutron sources are often an issue . in this case",
    "one uses only half of the device shown in fig .",
    "@xmath63 .        for the mathematical construction",
    "let us define @xmath64 as the angle between the axis connecting the focal points and a straight line from m to a point @xmath65 on the ellipse with index @xmath66 , as shown in fig .",
    "the angle @xmath67 of reflection at @xmath65 then follows from@xmath68where the angle @xmath69 is related to the slope of the tangent to the ellipse according to@xmath70notice that all angles are taken as positive except @xmath71 , which becomes negative for @xmath72 .",
    "these definitions provide a consistent common description for the mirror systems with toroidal and planar symmetry .",

    "ucns can be trapped in `` neutron bottles '' made of neutron optical and/or magnetic and gravitational potentials and are used for various applications in fundamental physics dubbers/2011,musolf/2008,abele/2008 ( for techniques and experiments using ucns see the books @xcite ) .",
    "owing to the vanishing absorption cross section of @xmath168he and a small probability for scattering ucns back to higher energies , a converter with reflective boundaries can accumulate a high density of ucns .",
    "if this is to be achieved in storage chambers of size comparable with the converter , a superfluid - helium ucn source at the end of a cold - neutron guide golub/1977,ageron/1978,golub/1983,kilvington/1987,huffman/2000,baker/2003,zimmer/2007,zimmer/2010,zimmer/2011,piegsa/2014,zimmer/2015,schmidt - wellenburg/2015,leung/2016 , can be competitive with `` in - pile '' implementations close to a cold - neutron source @xcite .",
    "the latter have however higher ucn production rates and can hence provide higher steady - state ucn fluxes and total ucn numbers in large vessels .",
    "advantages of an `` in beam '' source position far from strong radiation fields include absence of nuclear licencing , reduced cooling power , easy access , and short - distance ucn transport .",
    "a helium converter may even be implemented as an integral part of the experiment as in a planned search for a neutron electric dipole moment at the sns @xcite .",
    "the former cryoedm collaboration has already demonstrated polarised cold neutron conversion to polarised ucns @xcite .",
    "a multi - mirror system for monochromatic and polarised neutrons would thus be particularly efficient for this application .",
    "monte - carlo simulations for a system optimised for the small liquid hydrogen moderators foreseen at the european spallation source tdr - ess/2012 will be presented elsewhere @xcite ."

    "<S> a neutron optical transport system is proposed which comprises nested short elliptical mirrors located halfway between two common focal points m and m. it images cold neutrons from a diverging beam or a source with finite size at m by single reflections onto a spot of similar size at m. direct view onto the neutron source is blocked by a central absorber with little impact on the transported solid angle . </S>",
    "<S> geometric neutron losses due to source size can be kept small using modern supermirrors and distances m - m of a few tens of metres . </S>",
    "<S> very short flat mirrors can be used in practical implementations . </S>",
    "<S> transport with a minimum of reflections remedies losses due to multiple reflections that are common in long elliptical neutron guides . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , well - defined reflection angles lead to new possibilities for enhancing the spectral quality of primary beams , such as clear - cut discrimination of short neutron wavelengths or beam monochromation using bandpass supermirrors . </S>",
    "<S> multi - mirror imaging systems may thus complement or even replace ordinary neutron guides , in particular at the european spallation source .    </S>",
