    "the mechanism of activated transport in liquids near the glass transition and its dramatic slowing down with compression and/or cooling remains a subject of controversy .",
    "@xcite it is also of great interest in applications ; understanding the mechanism will allow us to reliably estimate the relaxation barriers in liquids and thus make predictions on the glass - forming ability of specific substances , among many other things .    the present article attempts to clarify several aspects of the `` entropic droplet '' mechanism of the activated transport , due to wolynes and coworkers ,  @xcite and obtains simple , qualitative expressions for the activation barrier and the cooperativity length for the @xmath0-relaxation that connect to material properties very explicitly .",
    "the argument also delineates the role of local fluctuations in the energetics of the activated transport .    according to the random first order transition ( rfot ) theory ,",
    "liquids undergo a crossover from mainly collisional to activated transport at sufficiently high densities and/or low temperatures.@xcite a thermodynamic signature of the crossover is that the liquid density profile is no longer uniform but , instead , becomes a collection of sharp peaks .",
    "@xcite the peaks correspond to particles vibrating around certain positions in space , analogously to regular , periodic crystals .",
    "in contrast with the periodic crystals , the aperiodic structures are however _ transient _ , even if long - lived . mutual reconfiguration between distinct",
    ", long - lived aperiodic structures occurs via local activated events . as a result of these local reconfigurations ,",
    "the liquid flows and the translational symmetry is eventually restored . in kinetic terms , the crossover to activated transport corresponds to a well - developed timescale separation between atomic vibrations and translations .",
    "@xcite appropriately , in the meanfield limit the crossover corresponds with the kinetic catastrophe of the mode - coupling theory ,  @xcite whereby all translations freeze completely .",
    "both the long - lived structures and the mutual reconfigurations have been observed , respectively , by neutron scattering  @xcite and a variety of non - linear spectroscopic methods.@xcite the crossover to the activated transport may occur both above or below the fusion temperature , the two extremes corresponding to very strong and very fragile liquids respectively .",
    "@xcite in the latter case , a liquid below the crossover is formally supercooled . for generality",
    ", we shall call liquids in the activated transport regime _ glassy _",
    ", so as to include in the analysis strong liquids that are already in the activated regime but are not technically supercooled .    in the specific scenario by wolynes and coworkers,@xcite the activated reconfigurations proceed by a mechanism akin to _ nucleation _ , the corresponding free energy profile given by : @xmath1 the bulk driving force @xmath2 , in equilibrium , is entirely due to multiplicity of alternative aperiodic states : @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the configurational entropy per unit volume .",
    "lubchenko and wolynes  @xcite have clarified this notion using a library construction of aperiodic liquid states , which explicitly shows that although an individual aperiodic state is replaced by an individual state , the reconfiguration itself is still driven by the configurational entropy , which reflects the full ensemble of thermally relevant , distinct aperiodic states .",
    "the configurational entropy is the log - number of such thermally relevant states and is a convenient measure of the degeneracy of the liquid free energy landscape .",
    "counting such aperiodic states becomes unambiguous below the crossover , when particle translations and vibrations are timescale - separated and so mutual reconfigurations between the states are technically _ rare events_. the rate of such rare events can be evaluated quantitatively using the transition state theory .",
    "@xcite    the quantity @xmath5 has the formal structure of a surface tension term and accounts for the mismatch penalty between alternative aperiodic structures .",
    "kirkpatrick , thirumalai , and wolynes  @xcite ( ktw ) pointed out that the free energies of the aperiodic structures are _ distributed _ implying that a smooth interface between two such structures would generally distort somewhat to minimize the local free energy .",
    "this is because the penalty for small increases in the interface area increases slower with the extent of the deformation than the concomitant stabilization of the _ bulk _ free energy .",
    "ktw noticed that this situation is analogous to the random - field ising model ( rfim ) , in which the zeeman splittings on separate sites are uncorrelated gaussian random variables , where the distribution width is @xmath6 .",
    "the total field in a region of size @xmath7 thus scales as @xmath8 .",
    "hereby , a smooth interface between spin - up and down domains would distort to stabilize the randomly distributed zeeman energy .",
    "villain  @xcite devised a coarse - graining procedure by which one can estimate the effective surface tension coefficient @xmath9 , in the rfim , given the curvature @xmath10 of the interface . assuming that the hyperscaling relation @xmath11 ( ref .  ) for the heat capacity and the correlation length holds in the large droplet limit , ktw  @xcite have fixed the boundary condition for the @xmath9 renormalization at infinity , @xmath12 , to arrive at a particularly simple , scale - free relation between the effective surface tension coefficient and the interface curvature : @xmath13 where the surface tension coefficient @xmath14 at the molecular scale @xmath15 is proportional to the field @xmath6 : @xmath16 xia and wolynes  @xcite ( xw ) used notions of the classical density - functional theory ( dft ) to estimate @xmath14 without using adjustable parameters .",
    "this estimate leads to dozens of quantitative predictions for distinct glassy phenomena , both classical and quantum , see refs .   for reviews and refs .   for subsequent work .",
    "recently , the surface tension coefficient @xmath14 has been estimated using standard dft methods ,  @xcite the results consistent with the simpler xw argument .",
    "thus the original fluctuation field @xmath6 , which was introduced by ktw seemingly phenomenologically , would appear to be determined retroactively .    the nuclei of incipient aperiodic states , which evolve according to eq .",
    "( [ fr ] ) , have been called _",
    "entropic droplets _",
    "@xcite to reflect the entropic nature of the driving force for the nucleation .",
    "the critical size @xmath17 for an entropic droplet , at which @xmath18 , is given by @xmath19 while the barrier itself is @xmath20 this allows one to write down a simple relationship between the relaxation time and the critical radius : @xmath21 if the aforementioned hyperscaling relation were not assumed to be obeyed , the exponent @xmath22 would be replaced by @xmath23 , however the relation between @xmath24 and @xmath17 is still robustly scale - free within the nucleation scenario .    despite the apparent quantitative success of the entropic droplet picture , the latter is far from being universally accepted , see for instance refs .  .",
    "several aspects of the scenario appear to be particularly confusing or controversial , which we highlight in what follows .",
    "the free energies of the liquid before and after reconfiguration are on average equal , prompting a question as to what exactly drives the reconfiguration .",
    "the entropic driving force in eq .",
    "( [ fr ] ) seems _ non - standard _ from the viewpoint of traditional nucleation theory . for instance , because the bulk driving force is entirely entropic while there is an energetic component to the mismatch penalty  in systems other than strictly rigid particles  it may appear that the energy of the system _ increases _ after each nucleation event .",
    "clearly this can not be true in equilibrium in view of energy conservation .",
    "furthermore , nucleation profile ( [ fr ] ) suggests , at a first glance , that the nucleation event will proceed indefinitely toward @xmath25 , implying the reconfigurations are not local .",
    "xia and wolynes  @xcite and others  @xcite have argued the reconfiguration will be completed when the droplet size reaches a value @xmath26 such that @xmath27 , which is the value of @xmath28 prior to the reconfiguration event .",
    "the length @xmath26 thus gives the size of a cooperative region ; consequently one may think of a glassy liquid as a _ mosaic _ of regions that are relatively stabilized and are physically separated by relatively strained regions that are similar to interfaces between coexisting phases .",
    "( there are also important distinctions , to be discussed below . ) since @xmath29 , one obtains , by eq .",
    "( [ taur ] ) , an asymptotic scaling @xmath30 which seems to agree with state - of - the - art simulations on a variety of liquid models  @xcite at the lowest accessed temperatures although generally disagrees with higher temperature data .",
    "the latter disagreement is expected since at increasing temperature , activated dynamics are progressively affected by mode - coupling and barrier - softening effects .",
    "@xcite the identification of @xmath26 as the equilibrium droplet size implies , however , that the free energy @xmath28 does not reach a minimum at equilibrium and thus is distinct from the free energy of the system , which begs for further clarification .",
    "in addition , because the fluctuation field @xmath6 is not determined at the onset of the calculation of the activation barrier  even though it can be eventually estimated  the calculation of the mismatch penalty in eq .",
    "( [ fr ] ) might be regarded as not entirely constructive , even if internally - consistent .",
    "related to this is a simple notion that if there is no field @xmath6 to begin with , @xmath31 , one may superficially deduce that @xmath32 , by eqs .",
    "( [ sigmar ] ) and ( [ sigmah ] ) , which is clearly not true since there must be a mismatch penalty between distinct free energy minima .",
    "perhaps for these reasons , many have regarded the nucleation scenario largely as an analogy to the random field ising model ,  @xcite not a self - contained microscopic picture .",
    "even more extremely , the nucleation picture of the activated transport is often regarded  @xcite as a variation on the heuristic arguments of adam and gibbs .",
    "@xcite    bouchaud and biroli@xcite ( bb ) have put forth a somewhat different view of the activated transport , though still within the landscape paradigm . in this view , the ensemble of all states of a compact region of size @xmath33 consists of a contribution from the current state and contributions of the full , exponentially large set of alternative structures . as in the library construction , the surrounding of the chosen region is constrained to be static up to vibrational displacement .",
    "what sets apart the current state from all the alternative states is that it fits the environment better .",
    "the mismatch energy must scale with the region size @xmath7 sublinearly while the log - number of alternative states scales linearly .",
    "thus the stability of sufficiently _ small _ regions  which are smaller than a certain length @xmath33 analogous to @xmath26can be understood thermodynamically in a straightforward manner : the energetic advantage of being in the current state , due to the matching boundary , outweighs the multiplicity of poorer matching , higher energy states .",
    "( this is not unlike the stability of a crystal relative to the liquid below freezing . )",
    "the just listed aspects of the bouchaud - biroli picture are essentially equivalent to the library construction , and , in particular , with regard to the entropic nature of the driving force for the activated transport .",
    "in contrast with the ktw  @xcite and library construction ,  @xcite however , the bb scenario is agnostic as to the concrete mechanism of mutual reconfiguration between alternative aperiodic states , other that the reconfigurations must be rare , activated events . in the absence of such a concrete mechanism ,",
    "bb end up assuming a generic scaling relation between the cooperativity length @xmath33 and relaxation time that is similar to eq .",
    "( [ taur ] ) ; the exponent is generally different from @xmath22 , but necessarily _ positive_. in this view , a region _ larger _ than the size @xmath26 can still reconfigure via a _",
    "single _ activated event but would do so typically _ more slowly _ than the region of size @xmath26 . combining this notion with the lower bound on the cooperativity size obtained above",
    "one concludes that the cooperativity size is in fact @xmath26 and one does not face the subtlety stemming from the downhill decrease of the free energy profile @xmath28 from eq .",
    "( [ fr ] ) .",
    "non - withstanding its elegance , the bouchaud - biroli picture does rely on scale - free relations similar to eqs .",
    "( [ rsc ] ) and ( [ taur ] ) , which is not necessarily innocuous . such scale - free relations would naturally arise if the lengthscale @xmath17 ( and @xmath34 ) could in principle diverge , which is only possible if the configurational entropy @xmath35 could vanish , by eq .",
    "( [ rsc ] ) .",
    "( to avoid confusion , we stress that such vanishing could not be observed in practice , by eq .",
    "( [ frsc ] ) . )",
    "remarkably , the configurational entropy extrapolated beyond the glass transition temperature would vanish at a _",
    "finite _ temperature often denoted as @xmath36 .",
    "the vanishing of the configurational entropy  which is often referred to as the kauzmann crisis  @xcite  has been one of the most disputed topics in the glass transition field .",
    "there are mean - field models , such as the celebrated potts glass ,  @xcite which exhibits both a kinetic catastrophe analogous to the crossover from the collisional to activated transport , and an entropy crisis whereby the degeneracy of the landscape vanishes at a finite temperature .",
    "yet the applicability of mean - field potts models to liquids has been questioned .",
    "@xcite note however that two recent works have shown finite - dimensional potts - like models could in fact exhibit the rfot transition .",
    "@xcite additionally , spin models have been analyzed that exhibit the kinetic and thermodynamic catastrophes in mean - field , but in finite dimensions , the kauzmann crisis disappears and no diverging length of the type in eq .",
    "( [ rsc ] ) is found .",
    "@xcite last , but not least , stevenson and wolynes  @xcite have argued that a supercooled liquid will crystallize or partially order before the configurational entropy could vanish .",
    "we stress that in the nucleation scenario , formula ( [ rsc])which gratuitously happens to be also a scaling relation  is _ derived _ on a microscopic basis ; it is not postulated and does not rely in any way on the vanishing of the configurational entropy .",
    "for this reason , comparisons with spin models that may or may not experience the kauzmann crisis are not consequential so long as that the nucleation mechanism is in fact correct .",
    "now , because the ktw and subsequent derivations are quite specific as to the details of the activated event and the value of the surface tension , the nucleation scenario allows one to make not only qualitative , but also , apparently , _ quantitative _ predictions for many , seemingly disparate phenomena as already mentioned . to establish whether these successful predictions are not mere coincidences , it is imperative to ascertain whether or not the entropic - droplet picture is in fact fully constructive .    the present work clarifies",
    ", we believe , the potential issues listed above , which have been raised with regard to the entropic droplet scenario over the years .",
    "we thus confirm the constructive nature of the corresponding microscopic description .",
    "the key notion that resolves all of those seeming paradoxes is that , on the one hand , the free energies of the individual free energy minima are distributed . on the other hand , the minima can not interconvert by means other than the activated reconfigurations themselves .",
    "this is in contrast with nucleation of a minority - phase  @xcite during regular first order transitions , in which the microstates within individual phases interconvert on time scales much _",
    "shorter _ than the duration of the nucleation event . that the free - energy fluctuations in glassy liquids are frozen - in on the time scale of the nucleation event makes all the difference . as part of the argument",
    ", we show directly that the original ktw prescription that the local field @xmath6 be determined by the magnitude of free energy fluctuations is straightforwardly implemented using a standard calculation .",
    "the resulting expression for the activation barrier for liquid transport is very simple and confirms the physical view of a glassy liquid as a structurally degenerate pattern of frozen - in free energy fluctuations .",
    "@xcite we believe this expression represents a good zeroth - order estimate of the barrier that possesses a great deal of universality as it boils down to only two parameters reflecting the molecular interactions , viz .",
    ", the bulk modulus and configurational entropy . despite its qualitative nature , the argument produces barrier values that are in reasonable agreement with experiment .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  [ mosaic ] discusses the entropic driving force while section  [ mismatch ] revisits the argument for the mismatch penalty .",
    "we test the expressions obtained for the barrier against the experiment in section  [ tests ] . in section  [ conclusions ] , we summarize , derive several scaling relations for glassy liquids , and discuss implications of the present results for certain anomalies observed in cryogenic glasses .",
    "we are used to systems whose free energy surface is essentially independent of the system size : for instance , the free energy surface of a macroscopic ising ferromagnet below its curie point has two distinct free energy minima that can be distinguished by their average magnetization , which is up or down respectively . if the system is made thrice bigger , the free energy is simply multiplied by a factor of three ; that is , while the number of states within each minimum increases exponentially , the number of minima themselves remains the same , i.e. , two .",
    "in contrast , the number of free energy minima in a glassy liquid scales exponentially with the system size @xmath7 : @xmath37 , where @xmath35 is the configurational entropy per particle @xmath38 . under these circumstances ,",
    "the system will break up into separate , contiguous regions that are relatively stabilized ; the contiguous regions are separated by relatively strained interfaces characterized by a higher free energy density . to see this ,",
    "suppose the opposite were true and the free energy density were uniform throughout . owing to the multiplicity of distinct free energy minima , the nucleation rate for another relatively stabilized configuration is finite , as we will see shortly . as a result , the original configuration will be _ locally _ replaced by another configuration while the boundary of the replaced region will be relatively strained because of a mismatch between the new structure and its environment .",
    "thus in equilibrium , there is a steady - state concentration of the strained regions ; local reconfiguration takes place at a steady rate between distinct aperiodic structures .",
    "the concentration of the strained regions and the escape rate from the current liquid configuration can be determined self - consistently , as discussed by kirkpatrick , thirumalai , and wolynes ,  @xcite xia and wolynes ,  @xcite and lubchenko and wolynes .",
    "@xcite    here we provide a `` microcanonical '' version of that argument , which , we hope , will make certain aspects of the nucleation scenario less confusing .",

    "[ cal ] can be partially summarized by graphing the predicted values for the glass transition temperature for all three approximations against their experimental values , see fig .  [ tg ] . clearly , theoretical predictions for the glass transition correlate very well with experiment .    both for the xw and rl calculations ,",
    "the formulas for the barriers explicitly contain the molecular size @xmath15 .",
    "this molecular size is associated with the size of the rigid molecular unit , which we have called the `` bead . ''",
    "the bead size is well - defined for relatively rigid , weakly attractive particles .",
    "@xcite in covalently bonded liquids , on the other hand , it can be also understood as the ultra - violet cut - off of the theory .",
    "@xcite in any case , a reasonable estimate for @xmath15 can be obtained by calibrating the fusion entropy of the substance by that of a lennard - jones liquid .",
    "@xcite we have called this way to count beads `` calorimetric . '' because the uncertainty in the bead size @xmath15 is potentially a significant contributor to the deviation of the xw and rl predictions from experiment , it is worthwhile to vary it and see whether the deviation can be minimized .",
    "this has been done in ref .",
    "so as to bring the activation exponent @xmath234 to a fixed value of 35.7 and results in chemically - reasonable values of @xmath15 , except for otp .",
    "@xcite the barrier values corresponding to the so renormalized bead size are shown in fig .  [ sc ] for the seven substances in question .    the present predictions , eqs .  (",
    "[ fksc ] ) and ( [ fksc1 ] ) , do not depend on the bead size and so the discrepancy with experiment is entirely due to the error in the approximation and in the experimental values of the configurational entropy and the elastic constants . in fig .",

    "we observe that the temperature dependence of the so adjusted barrier is quite similar to experiment , perhaps more so than either of the xw or rl approximation .",
    "( we remind that the @xmath227-dependence of the rl - based barrier values can not be fully judged based on figs .",
    "[ cal ] and [ sc ] because temperature dependent data for the structure factor are not currently available ; as a result the values measured at @xmath237 were used . )",
    "we note that the experimental value for the @xmath238 ratio is subject to uncertainty in the prefactor @xmath144 and the cooling rate ; the ratio will thus generally differ from 35.7 .",
    "this , however , is not much of an issue with regard to comparing the _ slopes _ of the curves .",
    "finally we note that the cooperativity length @xmath33 can be straightforwardly computed using eq .",
    "( ( [ xiksc ] ) ) .",
    "the xw and rl based values of @xmath33 are very similar to each other and are close to the experimentally deduced ones in the first place . in view of the similarity of the values of the mismatch penalty computed with the present approximation with those earlier approximations ,",
    "the cooperativity length ( [ xiksc ] ) is automatically numerically close to those computed in ref .  .",
    "this work has revisited the mechanism of the activated transport in glassy liquids .",
    "we have highlighted a key notion that , we hope , will clarify the entropic droplet scenario of the activated transport , due to wolynes and coworkers .",
    "the mutual conversion between metastable ( aperiodic ) configurations shows an important distinction from mutual conversion between two _ equilibrated _ phases , such as during a conventional first order transition . in the latter case",
    ", the distribution of the energies of the microstates does not significantly affect the nucleation rate even if the mismatch penalty between the two phases strongly depends on the precise identity of the microstates on the opposite sides of the interface .",
    "this is because the microstates within the individual phases interconvert on times scales much shorter than the duration of the nucleation event . as a result , the mismatch penalty between two equilibrium phases is spatially uniform along the interface ( of constant curvature ) and does not deviate significantly from a certain average value .",
    "in contrast , interconversion itself between distinct aperiodic structures is mediated by creation of an interface between those structures . and",
    "so the mismatch penalty will strongly depend on the precise identity of the two states separated by the interface ; this penalty can be lowered by distorting the interface to give locally a bit more room to _ that _ state of the two which is lower in free energy , while not moving the interface as a whole .",
    "the magnitude of the mismatch penalty is essentially equal to the magnitude of local free energy fluctuations . in turn",
    ", this magnitude turns out to be straightforwardly related to thermodynamic properties of the liquid , see eqs .",
    "( [ dgi ] ) and ( [ gammafull ] ) , and is largely determined by the bulk modulus of the liquid . in its most approximate form , the reconfiguration barrier is given by the simplest expression of units energy one could write down , eq .  ( [ fksc1 ] ) , using the configurational entropy per unit volume and the bulk modulus ; note the latter has dimensions energy density",
    ". the inverse linear scaling of the barrier with the configurational entropy is special in that it is the only scaling in which the barrier does not explicitly depend on temperature . in turn , this special scaling is a direct consequence of the @xmath149 dependence of the mismatch penalty .",
    "interestingly , the barrier does not explicitly depend on the molecular length @xmath15 . to appreciate this",
    ", we note that the expression for the cooperativity length @xmath33 does not explicitly contain @xmath15 either .",
    "this is consistent with the mismatch penalty originating from ordinary structural fluctuations which have gaussian statistics and are scale free .",
    "such fluctuations would not lead to a static heterogeneity , consistent with the results of an independent argument by cammarota and biroli .",
    "@xcite in fact , one may think of the mismatch itself as a stress pattern corresponding to frozen - in structural fluctuations or frozen - in _ stress _ , consistent with the elasticity - based picture of glassy liquids of bevzenko and lubchenko .",
    "@xcite    although entropic droplet nucleation and mutual nucleation of two coexisting _ thermodynamic _ phases are similar in some respects , they also exhibit important differences , including distinct scalings of the mismatch penalty with the droplet size .",
    "in addition , during regular first order transitions , the two phases separated by the interface are themselves minima of the free energy of the system .",
    "the interfacial configurations may be thought of as corresponding to the barrier that separates the two minima in the bulk term of the landau - ginzburg functional that describe the two phases . as a result ,",
    "the physical space is either wholly occupied by one of the phases or the two phases both occupy macroscopic regions , if they are in near equilibrium .",
    "the interfacial configurations thus occupy a negligible portion of the sample .",
    "in contrast , the contents of an entropic droplet by themselves do _ not _ correspond to a minimum of the free energy .",
    "the metastable configuration in the _ beginning _ of an activated event ( @xmath239 ) does correspond to a free energy minimum , and so does the configuration at the _ end _ of an activated event , upon which a compact region of size @xmath115 has been replaced by an alternative structure .",
    "the border between the reconfigured region and its environment is generally characterized by a higher free energy density .",
    "the original configuration _ also _ contained similarly strained regions that had resulted from preceding reconfigurations at the locale in question ; the energy is thus conserved , on average , as a result of activated events .",
    "one may think of a glassy liquid as a mosaic of relatively stabilized regions separated by relatively strained regions .",
    "these strained regions can be thought of as transiently frozen - in stress , see ref .   and , also , very recent work by the same authors ,  @xcite in which alternative procedures of defining the built - in stress are carefully discussed .",
    "the present discussion gives a relatively simple perspective on one of the most intriguing aspects of the structural glass transition : in spin glasses , as in the sherrington - kirkpatrick model ,  @xcite the disorder is quenched .",
    "in contrast , the molecular interactions are translationally invariant and so the disorder in liquids is _ self - generated_. what is the mechanism of this self - generation ?",
    "the classical density functional theory has shown conclusively that aperiodic structures become metastable at sufficiently high densities.@xcite within the replica methodologies ,  @xcite one can arrive at the disorder by considering , for instance , a random field generated by a generic boundary for a compact liquid region and then determining this field self - consistently . within the present discussion , the random field",
    "is indeed created by an environment composed of aperiodic structures .",
    "the field is effectively static  not unlike the quenched disorder in spin models  but only on the time scale of the activated reconfigurations and thus _ transiently breaks _ the translational symmetry .    because the environment is static , the free energy profile @xmath28 from eq .",
    "( [ fr])or @xmath135 from eq .",
    "( [ fn1])is not the actual free energy of the system .",
    "instead , it gives the log - number ( times @xmath136 ) of the states thermally available to a chosen compact region under the constraint that its environment be static up to vibration .",
    "the value of @xmath240 is thus special in that it signifies the cooperativity size @xmath107 for the reconfigurations because an alternative , mechanically metastable state is available at @xmath115 .",
    "the downhill decrease of @xmath135 at @xmath137 does not mean that an individual nucleation event will proceed indefinitely past @xmath107 but , instead , that the environment itself will eventually proceed to reconfigure .",
    "alternatively , one may think of this downhill decrease as reflecting that more than one aperiodic state with a comparable energy  within the fluctuation range in eq .",
    "( [ deltae])is available to a region of size @xmath241 .",
    "the identity of the state to which the liquid will reconfigure is subject to the precise barrier separating that state from the initial configuration . note that like the bulk free energy of the individual aperiodic states , this barrier is also distributed .",
    "the width of this distribution is determined by the configurational heat capacity , which is ultimately responsible for the correlation between the heat capacity jump at the glass transition and the degree of non - exponentiality of liquid relaxations , as established by xia and wolynes .",
    "@xcite the barrier distribution is also instrumental in the violation of the stokes - einstein relation and decoupling between various processes in supercooled liquids .",
    "@xcite    we finish by pointing out several convenient relationships between material constants and various characteristics of the glass transition . for instance , the configurational entropy can be estimated according to the expression : @xmath242 in view of the near universality of @xmath243 at the glass transition , where it is close to 35 or so , we obtain that @xmath244    likewise , the cooperativity size can be written as @xmath245 ^ 2 \\frac{k_b t}{k},\\ ] ] again note @xmath33 does not explicitly depend on the molecular length @xmath15 . according to eq .",
    "( [ xik ] ) , the cooperative size near the glass transition is on the order of a few hundred rigid molecular units : @xmath246    lubchenko and wolynes  @xcite have argued that the density of states of the two - level systems in cryogenic glasses is approximately equal to @xmath247 . by eq .",
    "( [ xik ] ) , this yields : @xmath248 ^ 2 } , \\ ] ] where @xmath249 is the isothermal bulk modulus just above the glass transition .",
    "another interesting quantity is the boson peak frequency , which has been estimated by lubchenko and wolynes  @xcite to be about @xmath250 , where @xmath251 is the debye frequency .",
    "this prediction is consistent with experiment .",
    "@xcite using @xmath252 , we get @xmath253 , where @xmath254 is the speed of sound . further noting that @xmath255 , where @xmath256 is the mass density , and using eq .",
    "( [ xik ] ) , we obtain a scaling relation @xmath257^{2/3}}.\\ ] ]    lastly , consider the quantity @xmath258 that has been argued  @xcite to determine the ratio of the phonon mean - free path @xmath259 to the the thermal phonon wavelength @xmath260 in cryogenic glasses . within the xw approximation ,",
    "the @xmath258 is independent of the bead size @xmath15 and is universal at @xmath237 . in the present approximation ,",
    "this ratio does explicitly depend on @xmath15 and also on @xmath139 : @xmath261 ^ 2 \\frac{k_b t_g}{k(t_g ) a^3}.\\ ] ]    in practice , the ratio of the bulk modulus to the glass transition temperature does not vary all that much between different substances because , on the one hand , the @xmath262 is nearly universal , owing to the lindemann criterion , while the @xmath263 ratio is often numerically near 1.5 , even though it does seem to vary between 1.2 and 1.6 . as a result ,",
    "the cooperativity length @xmath33 will exhibit a great deal of universality ; the easiest way to vary it in experiment may be to play with the cooling rate at the glass transition .",

    "<S> * abstract : * we explore several potential issues that have been raised over the years regarding the `` entropic droplet '' scenario of activated transport in liquids , due to wolynes and coworkers , with the aim of clarifying the status of various approximations of the random first order transition theory ( rfot ) of the structural glass transition . in doing so </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate the mismatch penalty between alternative aperiodic structures , above the glass transition ; the penalty is equal to the typical magnitude of free energy fluctuations in the liquid . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting expressions for the activation barrier and the cooperativity length contain exclusively bulk , static properties ; in their simplest form they contains only the bulk modulus and the configurational entropy per unit volume . </S>",
    "<S> the expressions are universal in that they do not depend explicitly on the molecular detail . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted values for the barrier and cooperativity length and , in particular , the temperature dependence of the barrier are in satisfactory agreement with observation . </S>",
    "<S> we thus confirm that the entropic droplet picture is indeed not only internally - consistent but is also fully constructive , consistent with the apparent success of its many quantitative predictions . </S>",
    "<S> a simple view of a glassy liquid as a locally metastable , degenerate pattern of frozen - in stress emerges in the present description . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we derive testable relationships between the bulk modulus and several characteristics of glassy liquids and peculiarities in low - temperature glasses . </S>",
