    "properties of light baryons have been extensively studied by various models based on the constituent quark picture .",
    "their results are consistent with experiments including applications for the one and two nucleon systems , although this model involves several adjustable parameters . despite the success of this approach , it is obscure whether or not these models correctly describe the quark distributions in the baryons , and in fact understandings of the non - leptonic weak hyperon decay and its @xmath2 rule are still incomplete .",
    "the @xmath2 rule implies dominance of the @xmath3 transitions on the non - leptonic hyperon decay@xcite .",
    "it is known that relative magnitudes of parity conserving decay amplitudes are reasonably described within the baryon pole approximation , where the weak decay takes place as the two quark transition process : a @xmath4-pair in the initial hyperon with their total spin @xmath5 being 0 changes to a @xmath6-pair in the final state baryon . however , if one calculates them using the constituent quark models , the absolute value of the amplitudes is about a half of the experimental data at most@xcite .",
    "we emphasize here , because of the heavy @xmath7-boson mass , the weak matrix elements are quite sensitive to the short range quark - quark correlations@xcite .",
    "consequently , the failure of the constituent quark model to describe the non - leptonic weak transition may indicate the lack of the quark correlation in the @xmath0 channel .    on the other hand , it was pointed out that , from both theoretical and phenomenological points of view@xcite , there exists a strong correlation between quarks in the @xmath0 channel .    in this work",
    "we try to clarify the roles of the quark correlation in the baryon structure and hyperon non - leptonic weak decays by using the constituent quark model .",
    "we assume the short range spin - dependent correlations between quarks together with the confinement force , and calculate the baryon masses and other static properties . in order to deal with the spin - dependent correlation correctly",
    ", we must rigorously solve the three body problem .",
    "for this purpose , we adopt the coupled - rearrangement - channel variational method with the gaussian basis functions which has been developed by hiyama and kamimura@xcite .",
    "we also focus on the su(6 ) breaking effects on baryon properties .",
    "introduction of the spin - dependent correlation naturally spoils the su(6 ) spin - flavor symmetry which is known to work well for e.g.  the baryon magnetic moments .",
    "we shall calculate the magnetic moments to estimate the su(6 ) breaking effects clearly .",
    "let us write the low energy effective weak interaction hamiltonian@xcite ; @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the quark 4-fermi operators , and @xmath10 give dominant contributions in our case .",
    "we take values of @xmath11 given in ref .",
    "@xcite at 1gev@xmath12 .",
    "our task here is to evaluate the matrix element @xmath13 for the strangeness changing process @xmath14 .",
    "the pcac relation and soft pion theorem are suitable to deal with the strong interacting pion - nucleon system . using them",
    ", one can find the baryon pole formula to the parity conserving amplitudes .",
    "for example , @xmath15 pole amplitude is given by , @xmath16 \\label{lambdapole}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the matrix elements of eq .",
    "( [ whamiltonian ] ) with appropriate baryon states , and @xmath19 denote the axial vector coupling constants which gives probabilities for the pion emission @xmath20 and are constrained by experiments .",
    "we come to determine the matrix elements of @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "we recall the quark models such as harmonic oscillator model or mit bag model give much smaller values for these matrix elements than the data@xcite .",
    "it is instructive to rewrite the @xmath24 operators @xmath25 in the non - relativistic limit in the coordinate space as @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 are annihilation and creation operators of quarks with flavor @xmath29 .",
    "presence of the spin - projection operator @xmath30 tells us that the weak transition is generated by the two body process between spin-0 quark pairs ; @xmath31 , which guarantees the @xmath1 dominance on the non - leptonic hyperon decays due to the antisymmetrization of the quark - pairs .",
    "now it is clear that this decay amplitude is sensitive to the correlation of the spin-0 quark pair in the baryons .",
    "the standard constituent quark model never incorporates such a quark - quark correlation properly .",
    "we phenomenologically introduce the effective hamiltonian which includes the confinement force and the spin - dependent part as ; @xmath32}\\cr } } \\right.\\quad ( s=0\\;\\mbox{pair})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 are the constituent quark masses , and @xmath34 are the model parameters .",
    "@xmath35 contributes to the over all shift of the resulting spectrum and is chosen to adjust the energy of the lowest state to the nucleon mass .",
    "constituent quark masses are taken to be @xmath36 and @xmath37 .    using this hamiltonian",
    ", we shall solve non - relativistic three body problem rigorously .",
    "we use the coupled - rearrangement - channel variational method with gaussian basis functions@xcite .",
    "we assume the isospin symmetry between @xmath38 and @xmath39 quarks , and solve the three body problem without further approximations or assumptions .",
    "the strange quark is explicitly distinguished from light @xmath40 quarks .",
    "we shall fix the model parameters so as to reproduce the nucleon and @xmath41 masses , proton radius and the @xmath42 amplitude , since this decay is completely dominated by the baryon pole diagrams ( see table 1 ) .",
    "we obtain the parameters @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "resulting mass spectrum is shown in fig.1 .",
    "it could be possible to obtain a better agreement by modifying the potential or parameters , but the present results are enough for our purpose .",
    "the effect of the attractive correlation can be seen clearly by introducing the average distances of the jacobi coordinate @xmath46 and @xmath47 defined in fig.2 , where all possible rearrangement channels are transformed to the configuration of fig.2 .",
    "we find , for the nucleon , @xmath48 and @xmath49 when the total spin @xmath5 of the quark pair @xmath50 and @xmath51 is zero , while @xmath52 and @xmath53 in the @xmath54 case .",
    "apparently , the quark correlation modifies quark distribution in the nucleon .",
    "the value of the wave function at origin @xmath55 in the @xmath56 case is about three times as large as that of the @xmath57 case , which provides an huge enhancement for the @xmath2 weak decay amplitudes .",
    "the matrix elements of the weak hamiltonian are calculated in terms of our wave functions .",
    "we find @xmath58gev@xmath59 ) as the full result and @xmath60 when we omit the correlation .",
    "similarly , @xmath61 with @xmath62 , while it becomes @xmath63 without @xmath62 . in the absence of the correlation @xmath62 , a ratio @xmath64 shows a perfect agreement with the su(6 ) expectation @xmath65 . in the realistic case with @xmath62",
    ", one can observe the substantial enhancement and the su(6 ) breaking effect .    with these values , calculated",
    "weak transition amplitudes are tabulated in table 1 .",
    "we show the pole contributions only in the second column , and the sum of the pole , factorization and penguin contributions in the third column to be compared with the experiments . we find a good agreement for @xmath66 decays , while the @xmath67 amplitude is not enough .",
    "we note that the small value of the @xmath67 pole contribution is caused by the strong cancellation of the two terms in eq .",
    "if we vary the axial - vector coupling @xmath68 within the experimental errors ( @xmath69 ) , we find about @xmath70 increase of the @xmath67 pole contribution with the @xmath71 decay amplitudes almost unchanged .",
    "our wave functions clearly violate the naive su(6 ) spin - flavor symmetry for the baryon .",
    "in fact , the ratio @xmath72 becomes @xmath73 , instead of the su(6 ) value @xmath74 .",
    "thus , we estimate the size of the su(6 ) breaking effect to be about @xmath75 , which is significant . on the other hand",
    ", it is historically known that the light baryon magnetic moments are well reproduced in the naive quark model by virtue of the su(6 ) spin - flavor symmetry .",
    "hence , it is important to examine the su(6 ) breaking by calculating the magnetic moments .",
    "our results are shown in table 2 .",
    "it is manifest that the results are almost unchanged even after introducing the spin - dependent correlations .",
    "the differences are of order of a few @xmath76 in any cases .",
    "it seems that the global baryon properties such as magnetic moments obtained by integrating the wave function over space are insensitve to the quark correlation , although the local structure of the quark wave function is modified substantially .",
