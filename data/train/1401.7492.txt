    "single strands of dna are , abstractly , @xmath3-quaternary sequences , with the four letters denoting the respective nucleic acids : _ adenine _ ( @xmath4 ) , _ citosine _ ( @xmath5 ) , _ guanine _ ( @xmath6 ) , and _ thymine _  ( @xmath7 ) . strands of dna sequence are oriented ; for instance , @xmath8 is distinct from @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , dna is ordinarily double stranded : each sequence @xmath10 , or strand , occurs with its _ reverse complement _",
    "@xmath11 , with reversal denoting that the sequences of the two strands are oppositely oriented , relative to one other , and with complementarity denoting that the allowed pairings of letters , opposing one another on the two strands , are @xmath12 or @xmath13the canonical watson - crick pairings .",
    "for instance , two sequences @xmath8 and @xmath14 are reverse complement of one another . obviously , for any strand @xmath10 , we have  @xmath15 .    whenever two , not necessarily complementary , oppositely directed dna strands `` mirror '' one another , they are capable of coalescing into a dna duplex which is based on hydrogen bonds between some pairs of nucleic acids .",
    "namely , pair @xmath12 forms _ two _ bonds , pair @xmath13 forms _ three _ bonds , and any other pair is called a _ mismatch _ because it does not form any bond .",
    "the process of forming dna duplexes from single strands is referred to as dna _",
    "the greatest energy of dna hybridization ( the greatest stability of dna duplex ) is obtained when the two sequences are reverse complement of one another and the dna duplex formed is a watson - crick ( wc ) duplex .",
    "however , there are many instances when the formation of non - wc duplexes are energetically favorable . the energy of dna hybridization ( the stability of dna duplex ) @xmath16 of two single dna strands @xmath10 and @xmath17 is , to a first approximation , measured by the longest length of a common subsequence ( not necessary contiguous ) of either strand and the reverse complement of the other  @xcite . for two",
    "mutually reverse complementary strands @xmath10 and @xmath11 of length @xmath1 , this measure plainly equals their length @xmath1 , i.e. , the maximum number of watson - crick bonds ( complementary letter pairs ) which may be formed between two oppositely oriented strands : @xmath18 for instance , if @xmath8 and @xmath14 , then @xmath19 .",
    "a dna code @xmath20 is a collection of @xmath21 single stranded dna sequences ( codewords ) of fixed length @xmath1 where each strand occurs with its reverse complement and no strand in the code equals its reverse complement  @xcite , i.e. , if @xmath22 , then @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in dna hybridization assays ,",
    "the general rule is that formation of wc duplexes is good , but the formation of non - wc duplexes is bad .",
    "a primary goal of dna code design is to be assured that a fixed temperature can be found that is well above the melting point of all non - wc duplexes and well below the melting point of all wc duplexes that can form from strands in the code .",
    "thus the formation of any wc duplex must be significantly more energetically favorable than all possible non - wc duplexes . note  @xcite that for biotechnical applications , the code length @xmath1 , @xmath25 , is experimentally accessible and that codes with up to @xmath26 codewords could soon be called  for .",

    "since each experiment is expensive we are interested in the _ junction _ of these pools into one big _ metapool _ and performing only one experiment over this metapool .",
    "then we face a problem of singling out some copies of each object from this mixture for analyzing experiment results .    for this purpose , there exists a method in which codewords of a dna code @xmath20 of size @xmath21 , where @xmath28 is an even number , are used as _",
