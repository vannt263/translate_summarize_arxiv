    "measuring of the structure functions is an unique tool for the study of the nucleon internal structure - together with the quark - parton model ( qpm ) giving the relations between the structure functions and the parton distributions , which represent a final , detailed picture of the nucleon . in this sense , these relations , obtained under definite assumptions , are extraordinary important , since the distribution functions themselves are not directly measurable . at the same time , the standard , simple formulas relating the structure and distribution functions are ordinarily considered so self - evident , that in some statements , the both are identified .    the experiments dedicated to the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , are oriented to the measuring either _ unpolarized _ or _ polarized _ structure functions . the results on the unpolarized functions are compatible with our expectations based on the qpm and qcd , but the situation for the polarized functions is much more complicated . until now ,",
    "it is not well understood , why the integral of the proton spin structure function @xmath1 is substantially less , than expected from very natural but possibly equally naive assumption , that the nucleon spin is created by the valence quarks .",
    "presently , there is a strong tendency to explain the missing part of the nucleon spin as a result of the considerable contributions of the sea quarks ( particularly strange quarks ) and the gluons . nevertheless , a consistent explanation of the underlying mechanism is still missing . during the last years , the hundreds of papers have been devoted to the nucleon spin structure , for the present status see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , the comprehensive overviews @xcite,@xcite and citations therein .    in the present paper we continue",
    "our discussion started in @xcite , @xcite , where we have shown , that the standard formulation of the qpm , conceptually firmly connected with the infinite momentum frame ( imf ) , oversimplifies the parton kinematics .",
    "in @xcite we demonstrated that the effect of oversimplified kinematics in imf can have an impact particularly on the spin structure function @xmath1 , or more exactly , it can substantially modify the relation between the distribution and spin structure functions .",
    "we have suggested this effect can be a source of the discrepancy between the experimentally measured and naturally expected magnitude of the spin function @xmath1 .",
    "the primary aim of this paper is to precise just this point .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the following section",
    "we add some comments to our master equations connecting the structure and distribution functions and point out the distinction between them and these used in the standard approach . in the sec .",
    "we propose the model , in which the internal motion of quarks is consistently taken into account .",
    "further , in contradistinction to the standard treatment based on the qcd evolution of the distribution functions in dependence on @xmath2 , our model rather aims at describing the part of distribution and structure functions , which are not calculable in terms of the pertubative qcd . in the sec . [ sec4 ] .",
    "the results of the model on the polarized and unpolarized proton structure functions are compared with the experimental data and some free parameters are fixed .",
    "some important additional comments on the model and obtained results are done in the sec .",
    "the last section is devoted to the overall summary and concluding remarks .",
    "since this paper should be read together with @xcite , @xcite , for convenience we refer to the equations or figures in these papers simply with prefixes p , q .    for completeness ,",
    "in the appendix we give a more rigorous explanation , that the approximation of the term @xmath3 entering the argument of the @xmath4functions in some integrals in this and two the previous papers is for our purpose fully acceptable .",
    "in the preceding discussion @xcite,@xcite we have shown [ see eqs .",
    "( p3.41 ) , ( q2.1 ) ] , that if one assumes momenta distributions ( q2.2 ) , ( q2.3 ) of quasi - free quarks having mass @xmath5 are spherically symmetric in the nucleon rest frame , then the corresponding structure functions @xmath6obey the master equation@xmath7 + a(p_\\alpha q_\\beta + p_\\beta q_\\alpha ) + bq_\\alpha q_\\beta\\ ] ] @xmath8 @xmath9 simultaneously , we have shown , how the explicit solution of this equation looks like . in this solution , the mass @xmath10 formally appears as a free parameter .",
    "let us make a remark , in the same way a similar equation can be obtained and solved also for the set of the neutrino structure functions , nevertheless in this paper we shall deal only with the electromagnetic ones .",
    "let us note , despite of the fact that eq .",
    "( [ ms21 ] ) is assembled for quark momenta distributions @xmath11 in the nucleon rest frame , the equation is relativistically covariant .",
    "its manifestly covariant form follows immediately from ( [ ms21 ] ) after the substitution @xmath12 for moving nucleon we have @xmath13 and @xmath14 which means , that the phase space of the subset of quarks with @xmath15 fixed , represented by the sphere @xmath16 in the nucleon rest frame , is in a boosted system correctly represented by the ellipsoid with the shape defined by the lorentz transform ( [ ms24 ] ) .",
    "further , the eq .",
    "( [ ms21 ] ) involve also the quark polarization vector @xmath17 , which as follows from @xcite , plays the crucial role for the evaluation of the spin structure functions @xmath18 so here we consider desirable to derive its form in a more rigorous way , than we suggested for eq . ( q2.12 ) .",
    "generally , quark polarization vector should be constructed from the proton momentum @xmath19 , proton polarization vector @xmath20 and the quark momentum @xmath21 : @xmath22 where @xmath23 are invariant functions of @xmath24 then contracting of eq .",
    "( q2.5 ) with @xmath25 and @xmath26 and using relations ( q2.4 ) give the equations @xmath27",
    "@xmath28 @xmath29 elimination of @xmath30 gives @xmath31 and since @xmath32 are independent , @xmath33 must be zero .",
    "the remaining invariants @xmath34 follow from eq . (",
    "q2.4 ) , which implies @xmath35 and solution of these equations reads @xmath36 so the quark polarization vector has the form @xmath37 contributions of both possible solutions [ sign @xmath38 means that quark spin is parallel ( antiparallel ) to the proton spin in its rest frame ] are in our calculation taken into account by the difference in eq .",
    ". apparently , for the proton rest frame and polarization @xmath39 the last equation is identical to eq . ( q2.12 ) .",
    "further , obtained invariants @xmath23 now give spin structure functions from eqs .",
    "( [ cr2 ] ) , ( [ cr3 ] ) in covariant form @xmath40 @xmath41 apparently , according to these relations the structure functions can depend also on mutual orientation of @xmath20 and @xmath42 of course , this dependence is more complicated , apart the factor @xmath43 ahead of the integrals , integration involves the terms @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "this question is being studied and will be discussed in a separate paper . in the present paper",
    "our considerations will be based on the results obtained in @xcite , which follow from eqs .",
    "( [ cr9 ] ) , ( [ cr10 ] ) applied in the proton rest frame for the longitudinal polarization @xmath39 .",
    "obviously , for this case the last two equations are equivalent to eqs .",
    "( q2.13 ) , ( q2.14 ) .    the scheme based on the eqs .",
    "( [ ms21 ] ) and ( [ cr8 ] ) with all their implications suggested in @xcite,@xcite can be a priori valid for quasi - free quarks ( on mass shell ) filling up the nucleon volume . in this sense the scheme represents a covariant formulation of the naive qpm .",
    "we have shown that eq .",
    "( [ ms21 ] ) in which the quark internal motion is consistently taken into account imply relations between the structure and distribution functions different from those obtained in the standard procedure relying on the imf , which is based on the approximation @xmath46 ( parton momenta components are @xmath47 fractions of the proton momenta components ) .",
    "in fact this approximation in the covariant formulation is equivalent to the assumption , that the partons are static with respect to the nucleon , therefore there are suppressed not only the transversal momenta , but also longitudinal ones .",
    "of course , this consequence is somewhat obscured just in the imf , where all the relative motion is frozen , since all the processes run infinitely slowly - including the passing of the probing lepton through the nucleon .",
    "let us remark , the standard relations ( e.g. @xmath48 ) obtained in the naive qpm with static quarks are currently applied even in the standard approach based on qcd improved qpm , which is not a consistent procedure , since it means that correct dynamics is combined with incorrect kinematics .    in this way we have shown , that the relations between the structure and distribution functions can be , at least on the level of the naive qpm , strongly modified ( particularly for the polarized case ) by the parton internal motion .",
    "this result can be instructive by itself .",
    "the impact of the quark intrinsic motion on the function @xmath49 has been discussed also in some other approaches @xcite-@xcite and necessity of the covariant formulation for the spin structure functions has been pointed out in @xcite .    however , the real nucleon is much more complex object , than just a bag of quasi - free fermions .",
    "but we shall try to assume the following .",
    "the relations obtained within the scheme suggested above can be used as a good approximation even for the interacting quarks , but provided that the term mass of quasi - free parton is substituted by the term parton effective mass. by this term we mean the mass , which a free parton would have to have to interact with the probing photon equally as the real , bounded one .",
    "intuitively , this mass should correlate to @xmath2 : a lower @xmath2 allows more time and space for the struck parton to interact with some others , as a result the energy is transferred to a greater system than the parton itself . and on contrary , the higher @xmath2 should mediate interaction with more  isolated  parton .",
    "moreover , we accept that the value of the effective mass even for a fixed @xmath2 can fluctuate - e.g. in a dependence on the actual qcd process accompanying the photon momentum transfer . this means , that the terms in the relations involving the mass of quasi - free parton @xmath10 will be substituted by their convolution with some mass distribution @xmath50@xmath51    in the following we shall propose a simple , but sufficiently general model for the unknown distributions @xmath52 in which all the dynamics of the system is absorbed . then , these distributions will be used as an input for the calculating of the corresponding structure functions .",
    "construction of the model is based on the following assumptions and considerations :    \\1 ) parton distribution @xmath53 representing the number of quarks in the energy interval @xmath54 can be formally expressed : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a probability that the nucleon is in the state with @xmath57 charged partons ( quarks + antiquarks ) of various flavors , and @xmath58 is the corresponding average one - parton distribution , which fulfills @xmath59    \\2 ) nucleon consists of the three quarks and partons ( gluons + @xmath60 pairs ) mediating the interaction between them , as sketched in the fig .",

    "are mutually cancelled , up to the three quarks giving additively the corresponding nucleon quantum numbers .",
    "these three quarks are in the figure marked by black and in our approach are identified with the _ valence quarks_. the reason , that such identification is quite sensible , is the following .",
    "apparently , the sum ( [ mss31 ] ) can be split into quark and antiquark parts @xmath61 , then our valence term reads @xmath62 which in the @xmath63representation exactly corresponds to the current definition of the valence quarks . correspondingly , the unmarked quarks are identified with the _ sea quarks_. but both the kinds of quarks have the same energy distributions @xmath64 entering the eq .",
    "( [ mss31 ] ) , in this sense they are completely equivalent . on the other hand , it is obvious , that for the valence quarks , in eq .",
    "( [ mss31 ] ) only  black  quarks from the figure contribute , therefore if @xmath58 is assumed in the first approximation independent on the flavor , then @xmath65    \\3 ) the quarks carry only part of the nucleon energy ( mass ) , @xmath66 where the factor @xmath67 equals roughly one half , the rest is carried by the gluons . in the first approximation",
    "we shall assume this factor is valid also for any term in the sum ( [ mss31 ] ) , @xmath68 which in other words means the ratio of the total energies of quarks and gluons , together constituting the nucleon mass , is the same for all possible states sketched in fig .",

    "for example , the constant @xmath188 [ see eq .",
    "( [ mss312 ] ) ] should take into account some suppression of the @xmath189 quarks @xcite and probably should allow a weak dependence on @xmath71 . also for the constant @xmath67 [ see eq .",
    "( [ mss34 ] ) ] some @xmath190dependence should be allowed . concerning this constant ,",
    "let us make one more comment .",
    "the standard global fit @xcite suggests ( at @xmath167 ) the quarks carry @xmath191 of the nucleon energy and our fitted value @xmath67 from the eq .",
    "( [ mss34 ] ) is roughly @xmath192 .",
    "this difference is mainly due to the different relations between the distribution and structure function in both the approaches , see eqs .",
    "( p3.38 ) , ( p3.59 ) .",
    "the second relation ( valid for a subset of quarks with effective mass @xmath71 ) , multiplied by @xmath193 and then integrated by parts gives @xmath194 which for the static quarks [ @xmath195 , see discussion after eq .",
    "( p3.59 ) ] coincides with the standard relation",
    ". nevertheless , generally both the relations imply different rate of the nucleon energy carried by quarks .",
    "one can check numerically that for our @xmath196 in a dominant region of @xmath71 the term @xmath197 in the integral ( [ ms51 ] ) plays a minor role ( see also fig .",
    "[ fg6 ] , positions of the maxima of @xmath83 s are above the corresponding @xmath71 , in particular for lower @xmath71 ) , so as a result we get @xmath198 of the standard estimation of the quark contribution to the nucleon energy .",
    "this ratio agrees with the ratio obtained from the corresponding fits : @xmath199    in the previous section we mentioned the effect of different shape of the @xmath200 and @xmath201quark distributions .",
    "also the result @xmath202 following from eq .",
    "( [ ms34 ] ) is a consequence of the simplifying assumptions @xmath203 and @xmath108 .",
    "a more general approach @xmath204 would give @xmath205 so @xmath204 implies @xmath206 .",
    "in fact , the global fit analysis proves , that @xmath207 is slightly  narrower  than @xmath208 it means , considering very qualitatively , in accordance with the last equation , in the function @xmath209 the negative term should dominate for smaller @xmath47 , which does not contradict the experimental data .",
    "obviously , a proper accounting for the difference @xmath204 into the model should enable to calculate consistently in a better approximation not only the proton and neutron structure functions @xmath210 , but also the neutrino structure functions .",
    "apparently then one could make a  super - global  fit covering the both unpolarized and polarized dis data . as a result , the flavor - dependent quark distributions @xmath186 [ or equivalently @xmath211 together with the corresponding effective mass distributions and the parameter @xmath212 controlling the relative spin contribution of the @xmath213 and @xmath201quarks , could be obtained .",
    "finally , let us point out , inclusion the spin structure function into the fit in our model enables to obtain some information about the distribution of the quark effective masses . within our approach there are two distributions , @xmath132 and @xmath214 , relevant for the description of the quark effective masses in the nucleon .",
    "the extrapolation of our parameterization for the @xmath214 distribution with the use of the relations @xmath142 and ( [ mssa38]),([ms329]),([ms335]),([ms41 ] ) give for @xmath215@xmath216 which implies the extrapolated @xmath214 is not integrable in this limit .",
    "on the other hand , the basic distribution @xmath132 , parameterized by eq .",
    "( [ ms329 ] ) with the @xmath217 from the set ( [ ms41 ] ) and with the use of the known relation @xmath218 can give an estimate of the mean value : @xmath219 i.e. @xmath220 for @xmath167 . the corresponding kinetic term calculated as @xmath221 gives a similar number ( @xmath222 ) .",
    "let us recall , these numbers are related to the valence quark term . the @xmath2-dependence is involved only in the distribution @xmath223 , i.e. in our parameterization ( [ ms329 ] ) only via the powers @xmath224 .",
    "it follows , the structure functions , which enhance in a low@xmath225 region for increasing @xmath2 , must be generated by the distribution @xmath223 in which the mean effective mass @xmath226 drops for increasing @xmath2 - in the qualitative agreement with an intuitive expectation .",
    "in the present paper , with the use of the results obtained in the preceding ones @xcite,@xcite , we proposed an alternative covariant formulation of the qpm .",
    "the initial postulates of the standard and our approach are basically the same , despite of that the relations between the structure and distribution functions obtained in both the approaches are not identical .",
    "it is due to the fact , that in the standard approach the intrinsic quark motion is effectively suppressed by the use of the approximation @xmath227 . on the other hand ,",
    "we have shown the master equations can be solved without the use of the this approximation , so in the corresponding solution the quark intrinsic motion is consistently taken into account .",
    "on the basis of the obtained relations ( a priori valid for the version of naive qpm - with non - static quarks on mass shell ) we propose the model , in which the distributions @xmath228 reflecting the parton dynamics are introduced with some free parameters . with the use of this model we calculated simultaneously",
    "the proton structure functions @xmath131 , assuming only the valence quarks term contributes to the proton spin . by a comparison with the data on @xmath184 @xmath229 we fix the free parameters and then on the basis of these parameters the functions @xmath169 and @xmath0 are predicted .",
    "we found out :    \\1 ) both the unpolarized structure functions are well reproduced by the model .",
    "the comparison is done with the data on @xmath83 and with the @xmath169 obtained from the standard global analysis data .",
    "\\2 ) at the same time , the model well agrees with the data on @xmath1 .",
    "the calculated @xmath0 does not contradict the existing experimental data as well , but since in the data there are still rather big statistical errors , it is hard to say more .",
    "\\3 ) analysis of the fixed parameters within our approach suggests :    @xmath230 the quarks carry less the proton energy ( almost by the factor 3/4 ) , than estimated from the standard analysis .",
    "@xmath231 the average effective mass related to the valence quark term can be roughly @xmath232 and a similar energy can be ascribed to the corresponding motion .",
    "so on the end we can underline the proposed model offers apart of the other results also the consistent explanation , why the experimentally measured proton spin function @xmath1 is less , than it is predicted in the standard approach based on the qcd improved qpm .",
