    "the snow line radius in a protoplanetary disc is the radius beyond which ice forms , and it occurs at a temperature of around @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "it is thought to have very important consequences for planet formation because the solid mass density outside of the snow line is much larger due to the condensation of water .",
    "the current location of the snow line in our solar system is within the asteroid belt , at @xmath2 .",
    "the outer asteroids are icy c - class objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) whereas the inner asteroid belt objects contain little water .",
    "thus , the snow line is thought to have been at its current location since the time of planetesimal formation within the solar nebula .",
    "most models of the evolution of the snow line location assume a fully turbulent steady - state accretion disc including viscous and stellar heating ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "turbulence is thought to be driven by the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) @xcite , and it transports angular momentum outwards allowing accretion on to the central star .",
    "however , these models all find that during the protoplanetary disc evolution the snow line moves inside the orbital radius of the earth ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , it is hard to form the relatively water - devoid earth in such models ( see introduction of * ? ? ? * for more details ) .",
    "however , it is now widely accepted that protoplanetary discs contain a `` dead zone '' , a region of zero or low turbulence @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that in a time - dependent disc with a dead zone the radial location of the snow line is quite different from that in the fully turbulent disc model .",
    "the inner parts of a disc with a dead zone are not in steady state because material is accumulating in the dead zone",
    ". however , the snow line occurs farther out in the dead zone , where sufficient material has accumulated that the dead zone is self gravitating .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thus around the snow line temperature , the disc may be in a self - gravitating locally steady state @xcite .",
    "in this work we first revisit the fully turbulent disc model in order to find an analytic approximation for the snow line radius in that model .",
    "we then develop analytic approximations for the snow line radius in a model with a dead zone and consider disc parameters for which this solution is relevant .",
    "material at radius @xmath3 in an accretion disc orbits the central star of mass @xmath4 at keplerian velocity , @xmath5 .",
    "viscosity ( when it is significant ) is generated by turbulence .",
    "if the disc is fully ionised , the gas is well coupled to the magnetic field and turbulence is driven by the mri .",
    "we consider steady - state solutions of this kind in section  [ turb ] .",
    "however , if the disc is not sufficiently ionised a dead zone may be present at the mid plane where the mri does not operate .",
    "this causes a pile up of material in the inner regions . with sufficient accumulation ,",
    "the outer parts of the dead zone become self - gravitating and a second type of turbulence is driven .",

    "if @xmath32 is larger , the disc is fully turbulent ( unshaded region).,width=317 ]    as the accretion rate through the disc drops , it is possible for the dead zone to eventually be accreted on to the star .",
    "this situation may arise if the external ionisation sources are strong enough to ionise the entire disc , as it becomes depleted .",
    "if this happens , then the disc will transition from the dead zone solution described in section  [ dz ] to the fully turbulent solution described in section  [ turb ] .",
    "the inner parts of the disc are thermally ionised and the mri operates out to the radius in the disc where the temperature drops below some critical value , @xmath63 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig ] ) .",
    "this is thought to be around @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "farther out in the disc , the external sources ( cosmic rays or x - rays from the central star ) ionise only the surface layers so that the mri operates in a layer with surface density @xmath32 .",
    "the transition from the dead zone solution to the fully turbulent solution will occur when the surface density in the fully turbulent disc ( at the radius where @xmath62 ) drops below @xmath32 .",
    "once this occurs , the whole disc becomes fully mri active .",
    "the value of @xmath32 is not well determined . if cosmic rays are the dominant source of ionisation , @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "however , in the absence of cosmic rays , x - rays may be the dominant source and in this case the active layer surface density is much smaller @xcite .",
    "the ionisation is further suppressed with the inclusion of effects such as ambipolar diffusion and the presence of dust and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons @xcite . in order to explain the observed t tauri accretion rates a value @xmath66",
    "is required @xcite .",
    "the radius where @xmath62 was found by @xcite to be @xmath67 where @xmath68 .",
    "they solved the fully turbulent disc equations described in section  [ turb ] but with an opacity law of @xmath69 @xcite , because the temperatures here are higher . in fig .",
    "[ turbfig ] we show the surface density of the fully mri turbulent disc as a function of the accretion rate at @xmath70 with @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath71 . if @xmath72 lies within the shaded region , the dead zone solution exists , whereas if @xmath32 lies in the unshaded region , the whole disc is mri turbulent .",
    "if , for example , @xmath73 , then the dead zone will be accreted once the infall accretion rate drops to below @xmath74 and the disc will transition to the fully turbulent solution .",
    "however , if @xmath75 , then the dead zone solution exists until the accretion rate drops to less than @xmath76 .    the total surface density at the snow line radius can be approximated by @xmath77 this is the surface density for the self - gravitating disc solution given in equation  ( [ sig ] ) , evaluated at a radius @xmath78 and temperature @xmath20 and where @xmath31 is related to the infall accretion rate through equation  ( [ q ] ) .",
    "the dependence on @xmath11 and @xmath4 in the surface density cancels out .",
    "the surface density increases with decreasing accretion rate .",
    "the surface density for a high accretion rate of @xmath79 is @xmath80 . at the minimum ,",
    "the surface density is at least an order of magnitude larger than the surface density in an active layer that is ionised by external sources ( such as cosmic rays or x - rays ) .",
    "thus , we were justified in neglecting the active layers in our self - gravitating dead zone solution in section  [ dz ] .",
    "we have not included the effects of irradiation from the central star in our models .",
    "when there is a dead zone present , the irradiation will have little effect on the solution because the heating is dominated by that from self - gravitational turbulence .",
    "in the fully mri turbulent solution , once the accretion rate becomes very low , @xmath81 , the irradiation becomes dominant and the snow line radius is approximately constant ( with accretion rate ) at a value of around @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xcite found an increase with decreasing accretion rate for these low rates because the disc becomes optically thin as the accretion rate drops .",
    "thus , the effect of including the irradiation would be to increase the snow line radius slightly for the smallest accretion rates .",
    "eventually the disc is thought to be dispersed by photoevaporation by the ultraviolet radiation from the central star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the ionising radiation produces a wind at large radii ( typically around @xmath83 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) where the material becomes unbound .",
    "this process begins once the accretion rate drops to a few @xmath76 , and the disc is thought to be photoevaporated on a short timescale of around @xmath84 ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "because our disc models are in steady state , it would be hard to include such effects .",
    "however , qualitatively , photoevaporation would have a similar effect to that of decreasing the infall accretion rate .",
    "provided that the dead zone exists until the disc is photoevaporated ( this is true for @xmath85 , see fig .",
    "[ turbfig ] ) , the dead zone solution will be appropriate for the entire disc lifetime ( after the initial outburst phase ) . in this case",
    ", the dead zone model predicts that the snow line in the solar system reaches its current value of @xmath2 at an infall accretion rate of @xmath86 . in order for the current snow line radius to be explained , the disc must be photoevaporated around this accretion rate .",
    "the snow line has important implications for planet formation . it is thought that while gas giant planets form outside of the snow line , the rocky terrestrial planets form inside the snow line .",
    "the location of an asteroid belt ( if one forms at all ) may also be a direct consequence of the snow line .",
    "giant planets form outside of the snow line thus preventing formation at and around the snow line and leaving an asteroid belt @xcite . knowing the location of the snow line may be important for future attempts to characterise the demographics of planets outside the snow line ( such as the proposed wfirst ) .",
    "we have assumed that the surface density that is ionised by external sources is constant in radius . a more realistic way to find the dead zone may be with a critical magnetic reynolds number ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the accretion rates produced by such models are too small to account for the observed t tauri accretion rates @xcite .",
    "shearing box simulations suggest that the turbulence in the mri active surface layers may drive a small but non zero hydrodynamic turbulence in the dead zone ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "providing that the turbulence is not strong enough for the disc to reach a steady state ( which is unlikely for realistic disc parameters ) , the disc model presented here will not be significantly affected .",
    "a variation of turbulence with height in a snow line model has been previously considered @xcite . however , the turbulence they included in the dead zone was sufficiently high for a steady state and thus the snow line radius was not significantly different from that in the fully turbulent model .",
    "there is an inner icy region within the dead zone predicted by our model .",
    "this is within the time dependent region of the disc .",
    "the inner edge of the icy region depends on the irradiation from the central star whereas the outer edge occurs where the disc first becomes self - gravitating .",
    "as material in the disc builds up , this radius moves inwards in time .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , this region could , in principle at least , allow for the formation of hot jupiters , close to the star , without the need for significant migration .",
    "however , the evolution of the distribution of water within a disc with a dead zone should be investigated in future work to fully assess the validity of this scenario .",
    "we have found an analytic expression for the radius of the snow line as a function of the infall accretion rate for a disc with a dead zone .",
    "this solution is appropriate for modelling the entire disc lifetime after the initial outbursting phase , up to the dispersal by photoevaporation , provided that the surface density in the mri active surface layers that are ionised by cosmic rays or x - rays satisfies @xmath85 .",
    "once the infall accretion rate drops to a few @xmath76 , the disc is dispersed by photoevaporation leaving the snow line at the radius where it is observed today , in the solar system at @xmath87 .    with the dead zone model , unlike in the fully turbulent model , the snow line does not pass inside the orbital radius of the earth .",
    "thus , with this model the formation of our water devoid earth is possible .",
