    "defects can be introduced during sample fabrication , or induced afterwards by irradiation .",
    "the latter possibility encompasses both point defects created by light ions and other particles , and amorphous columns created by high - energy heavy ions .",
    "these columnar defects , which have been heavily studied in high - temperature superconductors ( hts ) , serve as highly efficient pinning centers for vortices and alter a sample s response to a magnetic field .",
    "little work has been done on another group of unconventional superconductors , the heavy fermion ( hf ) systems .",
    "the two orders of magnitude difference in the critical temperatures of hts and hf superconductors changes the scale for thermal effects .",
    "thermal fluctuations which complicate hts behavior should be absent in hf .",
    "the spectacular response of one heavy fermion material , ube@xmath0 , to thorium doping makes it a good candidate for investigating other forms of lattice disorder .",
    "@xmath5 is not monotonic for u@xmath6th@xmath7be@xmath0 , and a second thermodynamic phase transition appears for @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "no other dopant has such effects .",

    "a second hf material , upt@xmath11 , also exhibits a double transition @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the lower phases of both upt@xmath11 and u@xmath6th@xmath7be@xmath0 have a significantly reduced vortex relaxation rate , while in pure ube@xmath0 the relaxation rate is linear in temperature @xcite .",
    "this may be evidence of time reversal symmetry breaking in the lower phase .",
    "if time reversal symmetry is broken , spontaneous magnetic fields can appear .",
    "boundaries between different magnetic domains can obstruct vortex motion , leading to the observed drop in relaxation rate .",
    "vortex motion is also reduced in u@xmath6th@xmath7be@xmath0 for zero - field - cooling as compared to the field - cooling case @xcite .",
    "domain wall pinning may explain this effect as well , since cooling in a field should lead to larger domains and fewer domain walls . the atypical vortex behavior and the distinction between the two superconducting phases suggests that vortices may also have interesting interactions with other types of pin sites , such as columnar defects .    here",
    "we investigate heavy - ion irradiation of ( u , th)be@xmath0 .",
    "we show that calculations predict columnar tracks to form . however , heat capacity measurements , imaging , and magnetization measurements suggest that such tracks are not actually present .",
    "we also discuss how heavy - ion damage affects the different superconducting phases .",
    "the thermal spike model explains damage creation in both elements and alloys @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the heavy ion loses energy primarily to the electrons , which in turn excite phonons .",
    "the electron - phonon coupling strength @xmath12 determines how fast the energy is transfered to the lattice , while the thermal conductivities @xmath13 and @xmath14 of electrons and phonons govern how the energy spreads through the sample .",
    "the coupled differential equations @xmath15 @xmath16 describe the energy transfer . here",

    "this formula , particularly the term involving @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , comes from fits to observed radiation distributions in water @xcite .",

    "the irradiation is performed at atlas , argonne national laboratory with 1.4 gev @xmath42 and @xmath43 ions .",
    "the ion velocities are 5.9 mev / amu and 6.7 mev / amu , respectively .",
    "the matching fields @xmath44 , at which the vortex density and track density are equal , range from 0.1 t and 7 t , corresponding to typical lateral track separations from 155 to 18.5 nm .",
    "the @xmath43 ions were used for the 3 t and 7 t samples , while the @xmath42 were used for the remaining samples .",
    "the irradiation takes up to two hours , depending on dosage .",
    "because of the very small probability that two ions will reach the sample at nearly the same time and position , we assume that each ion acts independently in damaging the sample .",
    "the inset of figure [ f : radius ] shows the electronic energy loss @xmath22 as a function of the incident beam energy , obtained from a stopping and range of ions in matter ( srim-98 code @xcite ) simulation .",
    "the beam energy used for the irradiation is near the maximum and gives @xmath45 kev / nm for uranium , @xmath46 kev / nm for lead .",
    "the corresponding nuclear energy losses are negligible , 0.05 kev / nm and 0.04 kev / nm , respectively .",
    "the predicted stopping distances are 56 @xmath39 m and 60 @xmath39 m , more than twice the sample thickness . from our thermal spike calculation ,",
    "the irradiation should produce defects with radius 2.8 nm ( uranium ) or 2.2 nm ( lead ) .",
    "after irradiation , both the 2.0 t ube@xmath0 and 7.0 t u@xmath1th@xmath2be@xmath0 crystals were further thinned and viewed in both a philips cm-30 transmission electron microscope ( tem ) and a jeol 3000f high resolution transmission electron microscope .",
    "the planes used for the images on the jeol machine limited the resolution to about 0.5 nm . at @xmath472.0 t the defects should be about 32 nm apart .",
    "the total viewing area of about 73,000 nm@xmath48 should contain about 70 defects but in fact shows no evidence of amorphous columns .",
    "for the 7.0 t sample , the imaging area of over 54,000 nm@xmath48 should have nearly 200 defects .",
    "we again find no damage of radius greater than 2 nm , and only six candidates with radius from 1 nm to 2 nm . of these ,",
    "closer examination shows that three are edge dislocations .",
    "the remaining candidates could also be dislocations , viewed from angles that do not clearly show a lattice plane ending .",
    "we find no compelling reason to identify them with columnar tracks , since they do not match the expected defects either in size or in density .",
    "we conclude that columnar defects are either absent in our sample or far smaller than anticipated from our thermal spike model calculations .",
    "we emphasize that the microscopes we used _ can _ detect amorphous regions of the expected size .",
    "a transmission electron microscope successfully imaged columnar defects of radius 5 nm in uo@xmath49 @xcite .",
    "high resolution tem has detected columnar defects with radius down to 1 nm , for example in tin oxide @xcite and bi@xmath49sr@xmath49cacu@xmath49o@xmath50 @xcite .",
    "we measure heat capacity on a dilution refrigerator at temperatures down to 100 mk and magnetic fields up to 8 tesla .",
    "we use a relaxation method with a ruo@xmath49 thin film thermometer , a [ 50:50 ] aucr thin film heater , and a fine copper wire as a heat link .",
    "figure [ f : cvst ] shows @xmath51 for the unirradiated , 5 t , and 7 t u@xmath1th@xmath2be@xmath0 samples .",
    "since we do not know the precise sample sizes , we use a multiplicative constant to set the normal state value of @xmath51 to 1.1 @xmath52 for each curve .",
    "we do not adjust the measured heat capacity for any contribution from the thermometer , heater , or mount ; but comparing the curves shown to previous heat capacity measurements on bulk samples suggests that background effects are less than 30% of our signal . in any case , the background should not affect our determination of the @xmath3 suppression or transition width .    irradiation does not measurably change @xmath3 up to @xmath53 t. as shown in figure [ f : cvst ] for u@xmath1th@xmath2be@xmath0 , @xmath51 changes shape only slightly even at a defect density of 5 t , broadening by several mk @xcite . at the higher defect density of @xmath54 t , the transitions do change shape .",
    "the upper transition widens by roughly a factor of two , and both decrease significantly in amplitude . here",
    "width is defined by identifying the change in @xmath51 across the transition and using the temperature difference between the 10% and 90% values of the heat capacity .",
    "irradiation has a similar effect on pure ube@xmath0 , reducing @xmath3 and slightly broadening the transition , while retaining the shape of the @xmath51 curve up to 5 t. table [ t : tc ] summarizes the effects of irradiation on transition temperatures for both compounds .",
    "the marked transitions come from magnetization measurements rather than heat capacity , as will be discussed later .",
    "since the @xmath43 ions used for irradiation have less energy loss than the @xmath42 ions , they produce smaller defects in a thermal spike calculation . depending on the value of the heat of formation",
    ", the uranium atoms might even produce defects while the lead atoms do not .",
    "we note here that the @xmath3 depression for the 3 t sample is consistent with the others .",
    "the 7 t samples have , if anything , a larger change in @xmath3 than expected from the lower irradiation dosages .",
    "thus it appears that the @xmath43 ions do as much damage as the @xmath42 ions , despite their smaller energy loss .",
    "it is tempting to take the nearly identical percentage suppression of the two thoriated transitions as evidence that both superconducting phases have the same pairing symmetry .",
    "however , the lower transition is between two superconducting phases , rather than between a superconducting and a normal phase .",
    "the usual arguments on how impurities affect the transition do not apply .",
    "we do note that the heavy - ion irradiation produces a different response from either non - magnetic or magnetic substitutional impurities @xcite .",
    "non - magnetic ( la ) impurities depress the upper transition but leave the lower transition unchanged , while magnetic ( gd ) impurities suppress the lower transition more than twice as strongly as the upper one @xcite .",
    "these contrasting behaviors of the two transitions for different types of defects emphasize the extreme sensitivity of the ( u , th)be@xmath0 system to changes in electronic structure .",
    "the @xmath3 suppression proves that the irradiation did create some damage within the crystals .",
    "however , the small amount of suppression , like the lack of visible columns in the imaging , suggests that the damage is _ not _ in the form of amorphous columns . for comparison , u ions at a 2 t matching field reduce @xmath3 of yba@xmath49cu@xmath11o@xmath55 by 5.3% @xcite , more than we find at 5 t. although in principle our low @xmath3 reduction could occur from insensitivity to defects , rather than an absence of defects , hf superconductors are _ more _ sensitive than other superconductors to both neutron and light - ion irradiation @xcite .",
    "even our @xmath56 tesla irradiation affects @xmath3 far less than the point defect work @xcite .",
    "the motion of superconducting vortices is particularly sensitive to defects .",
    "columnar tracks strongly pin vortices , even when the tracks are misaligned with the magnetic field by up to 40@xmath40 @xcite .",
    "our imaging work could miss incomplete or misaligned columns which would be detected in a sample s magnetic behavior .",
    "for these measurements we use bismuth hall probes with active area @xmath57 .",
    "we place the sample flat atop the substrate for the hall probe .",
    "the probe measures total field at a spot near the surface of the sample , from which we extract the local magnetization of the superconductor .",
    "we typically ramp the applied magnetic field at 15 gauss per minute , and take hysteresis loops large enough to allow for full penetration .",
    "the width of the hysteresis loop , @xmath58 , is proportional to the critical current @xmath59 ; and we measure both its temperature and its field dependence .    figure [ f : magandc ] compares hysteresis loop width and heat capacity for a sample . as @xmath60 increases , the hysteresis loop width decreases , closing at the same superconducting @xmath3 measured with heat capacity .",
    "for the 3 t thoriated and 7 t pure samples , the @xmath3 values in table [ t : tc ] are determined from magnetization rather than heat capacity data .",
    "we note that @xmath61 in figure [ f : magandc ] shows no feature at the lower transition .",
    "by contrast , magnetic relaxation measurements show a sharp drop in the vortex creep rate at the lower transition @xcite .",
    "upt@xmath11 , the other hf compound with two transitions , shows the same behavior : a drop in the relaxation rate at the lower transition @xcite , but no feature in the magnetization itself @xcite .",
    "one explanation of the difference between the two measurements is that the mechanism of vortex motion changes at the lower transition , while the pinning strength itself undergoes no sharp change .",
    "however , another possibility lies in the magnetic field history of the relaxation measurements .",
    "vortex creep is only suppressed when the sample is exposed to a sufficiently large magnetic field , typically 1 koe , before having the field reduced to zero for the relaxation measurements @xcite .",
    "our hysteresis loops , with maximum width of 200 oe , may simply be in a different regime where the vortex creep shows no signature at the lower transition .",
    "the magnetization data confirm that columnar defects are either absent or far smaller than expected .",
    "increased pinning from the columns would appear as wider hysteresis loops , but our loop widths are comparable for unirradiated and irradiated samples . in other superconductors",
    "columnar defects produce large effects from commensurability near integral multiples of @xmath44 , but our hysteresis loops have no features whatsoever in @xmath62 .",
    "one possibility is that any defects are too much smaller than 100  , the superconducting coherence length @xcite , to pin vortices .",
    "our magnetization measurements do show evidence of defect creation .",
    "figure [ f : loglog ] shows loop width versus normalized temperature for ( u , th)be@xmath0 crystals of several irradiation doses , taken at zero nominal field .",
    "the width follows a power law @xmath63 over the entire temperature range measured , approximately 0.3@xmath3 to @xmath3 . for the unirradiated and the 5 t samples @xmath64 , while for the 7 t specimen @xmath65 is reduced to 1.4 .",
    "although the magnitude agreement between the 5 t and unirradiated samples is partly coincidental , the 7 t sample has significantly the smallest @xmath58 observed . both the magnitude and slope change are probably due to the damage . as with the stronger @xmath3 suppression in the 7 t sample mentioned earlier , this hints that the 5 t irradiation is a threshold for strong damage in our ( u , th)be@xmath0 crystals .",
    "models for networks of superconducting grains give @xmath66 for superconductor - insulator - superconductor ( sis ) tunnel junctions @xcite and @xmath67 for superconductor - normal - superconductor ( sns ) junctions @xcite .",
    "an intermediate power law for @xmath68 , with @xmath65 near 1.5 , has been measured in various materials , including the hf material cecu@xmath49si@xmath49 @xcite .",
    "the intermediate values may come from mixtures of sis and sns junctions in the samples .",
    "similarly , the change in exponent for our 7 t sample is consistent with irradiation damage changing the characteristics of the grain network .",
    "we find the same power - law behavior in external magnetic fields up to @xmath69 kg , with the exponent independent of field .",
    "we have irradiated ( u , th)be@xmath0 crystals with high - energy u and pb ions at fluences up to @xmath70 t. the irradiation damage reduces both superconducting transition temperatures of u@xmath1th@xmath2be@xmath0 by over 15% for the 7 t bombardment , as well as lowering @xmath59 and reducing its temperature dependence .",
    "unlike in previous work with substitutional impurities @xcite , irradiation causes a similar @xmath3 reduction for the two transitions of u@xmath1th@xmath2be@xmath0 .    despite the measured @xmath3 reduction ,",
    "transmission electron microscope and hysteresis measurements suggest that the defects are not the amorphous tracks found in hts .",
    "our calculations of the irradiation process predict columnar defect formation for @xmath22 down to 23 kev / nm . our samples are irradiated above the threshold value , at @xmath71 kev / nm .",
    "the resulting defects should have diameter 5 to 6 nm , a defect size comparable to the 10 nm superconducting coherence length .",
    "the lack of pinning by the defects and their absence from the tem images means either that the actual radius is much smaller or that only incomplete columns or point defects form .",
    "we favor the third option .",
    "we rule out the first possibility because of the similarity between @xmath43 and @xmath42 irradiation : if the column radius were much smaller for @xmath42 ions , then no tracks should appear at all for @xmath43 ions .",
    "the lack of signal in the magnetization indicates that the sample does not have even incomplete columns , which would still pin vortices effectively . since the reductions of @xmath3 and @xmath59 show that some damage is present , we assume we have instead created point defects .",
    "the conditions for creation of columnar defects are important to understand , particularly as the use of such defects spreads from hts to other materials .",
    "it is unclear whether the discrepancy between the experiment and the thermal spike calculation comes from the values chosen for the parameters or from a deeper problem with the model .",
    "the thermal spike model has successfully predicted radiation damage both in other alloys @xcite and in elements , including uranium and beryllium @xcite .",
    "the simplest explanation would be incorrect parameters .",
    "although we use conservative choices , such as assuming resistivity constant rather than linear in temperature , our high - temperature extrapolations for @xmath72 or @xmath14 may be incorrect .",
    "many - electron effects produce a variety of unusual low - temperature effects in ube@xmath0 and other heavy fermion materials , and perhaps could influence higher - temperature behavior as well .",
    "we also show that the lower transition of u@xmath1th@xmath2be@xmath0 is not detectable in @xmath68 , despite the sharp change in magnetic relaxation rate previously observed",
    ". this may arise from differences in measurement procedure between our work and the relaxation rate studies .",
    "another possibility is that vortices in the two superconducting phases of u@xmath1th@xmath2be@xmath0 differ only in their behavior away from the critical current @xmath59 , which magnetization measurements would not probe .",
