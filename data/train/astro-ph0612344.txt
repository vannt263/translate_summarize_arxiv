    "this will be further examined by comparing the photometric and spectroscopic redshifts to a sample of cosmos galaxies with available such data .",
    "to explore the accuracy of photometric redshifts , we generated mock catalogs consisting of galaxies with the seds shown in figure 1 and photometry measured in the same filters used for cosmos ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the aims of the simulation is to explore dependence of the photometric redshifts on the @xmath48 ratio , magnitude limit , redshift and galaxy type and how we could minimise the number of outliers ( objects with very different output and input photometric redshifts ) .",

    "to each simulated galaxy , we also specified a redshift in the range @xmath50 .",

    "we restrict the mock catalog to galaxies with apparent magnitudes ( in any given band ) brighter than the observed magnitude limits in cosmos ( table 1 ) .",
    "we also assign photometric errors to each magnitude , depending on the s / n ratios with the same depth as real cosmos data .",
    "ideally , the photometric errors need to be estimated , also taking into account blending or defects on the images ( sources near bright objects and internal camera reflections ) .",
    "this can be performed by distributing images of galaxies with known mag / type / redshift into the existing multi - band images , apply the same photometric measurement scheme and then running the photometric redshift code .",
    "therefore , simulations here only provide an internal consistency check in reproducing the input parameters .",
    "the resulting catalog consists of simulated data , including : magnitudes and their associated errors in the same filters as in the initial cosmos catalog , redshifts and spectral types for each galaxy , all consistently derived .",
    "the mock catalog contains a total of @xmath5196,000 galaxies to a magnitude limit of @xmath52 mag ( s / n=5 - similar to the observed cosmos catalog ) .",
    "the photometric redshift code (  2 ) was used to estimate redshifts and spectral types for mock galaxies , using prior and considering extinction as a free parameter .",
    "results from the simulated catalog , showing the performance of the code , are presented in table 2 where , for each value of the magnitude limit ( i.e. @xmath48 ratio ) and spectral type , we estimate the _ rms _ scatter in photometric redshift error , defined as ; @xmath53 , the fraction and total number of outliers , defined as galaxies with @xmath54 ,  and changes in the median redshift as a function of the s / n ratios .",
    "the simulation results in table 2 clearly illustrates that the accuracy of photometric redshifts decreases as the limiting magnitude becomes fainter and the s / n ratio is reduced .",
    "moreover , we find that for early - type galaxies there is better agreement between the input and output redshifts , with a smaller fraction of outliers , compared to late - type and starbursts .",
    "this is likely due to a stronger 4000  break in ellipticals compared to later type galaxies .",
    "figure 3 shows comparison between the input and output redshifts as a function of i - band magnitude and @xmath48 . at @xmath55 mag ,",
    "the photometric redshift accuracy starts to significantly degrade .",
    "it is clear that at higher @xmath48 values ( i.e. brighter @xmath56 ) , photometric redshift code recovers the input redshifts .",
    "also , most of the scatter at faint magnitudes ( low s / n ) is due to late - type galaxies and starbursts .",
    "this will be used as a guide to adopt the photometric or magnitude limit of the sample in order to optimise photometric redshift measurement .",
    "the simulation results can be used to define a useful measure of the photometric redshift accuracy for each galaxy .",

    "this is to minimise photometric uncertainties and to uncouple performance of different photometric redshift error estimators independent from photometric problems at faint flux levels . for simulated sub - samples ,",
    "selected based on @xmath3 limits ( table 3 ; column 1 ) , we estimate @xmath10 values for the full sample and when excluding the outliers , defined as galaxies with @xmath9 .",
    "results are listed in table 3 , where it shows a clear decrease in @xmath10 values and in fraction of the outliers towards smaller @xmath3 .",
    "this demonstrates that @xmath3 provides a useful and practical measure to identify the fraction of outliers .",
    "moreover , the median redshift of the survey is found to be independent of @xmath3 , due to our @xmath48 cut .",
    "the scatter in @xmath11 increases with increasing @xmath3 and for fainter magnitude limits . for galaxies with @xmath62 , the scatter in @xmath11 significantly increases , indicating an increase in photometric redshift errors . for fainter galaxies ( @xmath63 mag ) ,",
    "where the accuracy of photometric redshifts decreases , we find an increase in @xmath3 parameter and larger scatter in @xmath11 .    in summary ,",
    "@xmath3 enables the identification of outliers in derived photometric redshifts , independent at all redshifts in the sample .",
    "the ultimate test of the accuracy of photometric redshifts is the comparison with the spectroscopic redshifts .",

    "we restrict the sample to redshift range @xmath4 , as beyond this , the 4000   break lies at the edge of the optical bands .",
    "also , due to the relatively shallow depth of our @xmath46-band data , these are not available for fainter galaxies .",
    "this reduces total number of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts to 879 .",
    "photometric redshifts were derived using the techniques described in  3 and compared with the spectroscopic redshifts in figure 5 .",
    "the effects of the luminosity function prior and extinction corrections are also explored .",
    "a total of 12 galaxies in the spectroscopic sample ( @xmath4 ) were identified as agns from their x - ray emission ( brusa _ et al . _",
    "the agns were removed from the spectroscopic sample and only the `` normal '' galaxies were used in the comparison .",
    "we measure the @xmath3 parameter for the 868 galaxies with @xmath4 in our spectroscopic sample .",
    "the relation between @xmath3 and @xmath65 is shown in figure 6a .",
    "galaxies with @xmath66 are seen to have , on average , @xmath67 although with some scatter .",
    "this confirms that , on average , @xmath3 parameter provides a good measure of the reliability of photometric redshifts .",
    "distribution of @xmath3 values for three spectral types of galaxies ( elliptical , spiral and starbursts ) in the spectroscopic sample are presented in figure 6b .",
    "the width of the distributions for different types are consistent with the observed scatter in figure 6a .",
    "the peak of the @xmath3 distributions are at @xmath68 ( for ellipticals ) and 0.12 ( for spirals and starbursts ) , indicating the reliability with which one could measure photometric redshifts for different spectral types of galaxies .",
    "table 4 compares the @xmath69 values and the fraction of outliers , defined as objects with @xmath70 , for different cases ( with and without prior and extinction ) .",
    "it is clear from table 4 and figure 5 that the best agreement between the photometric and spectroscopic redshifts are obtained when both prior and extinction corrections are enabled . in its best case",
    ", this corresponds to an _ rms _ of @xmath71 .",
    "this is consistent with the _ rms _ estimated from the simulations in  3 .",
    "it is also clear from table 4 that @xmath3 parameter is directly correlated with the fraction of outliers , as defined by @xmath69- ( i.e. deviation of photometric redshift from its spectroscopic counterpart ) .",
    "no trend is found between redshift and spectral types in figure 5 , indicating there is no significant bias in redshift estimates as a function of spectral type .",
    "finally , the relation between @xmath11 and i - band magnitudes for `` normal '' galaxies in the spectroscopic sample is shown in figure 7 .",
    "the errors in the photometric redshift shows no dependance on the magnitude of the galaxies or their spectral type .",
    "we divide galaxies into spectral type bins ( ellipticals , spirals and starbursts ) and compare their estimated photometric and spectroscopic redshifts , as listed in table 4 .",
    "the photometric redshifts are estimated for the case assuming prior and extinction ( the optimum case ) , considering all galaxies regardless of their @xmath3 .",
    "we find comparable @xmath10 values for elliptical ( 0.034 ) , spiral ( 0.030 ) and starbursts ( 0.042 ) .",
    "for each of the scenarios in table 4 , we also estimate the fraction of galaxies ( with respect to total ) of different spectral types .",
    "the result , listed in table 4 , shows a simultaneous decrease in the fraction of ellipticals and increase in the fraction of starbursts when extinction correction is enabled .",
    "no significant change in the fraction of spirals is observed .",
    "figure 5 shows a reduction in @xmath72 for ellipticals when extinction correction is applied , with this having a less significant effect for the starbursts , contrary to expectations .",
    "however , as shown in table 4 , we find a change in the fraction of both ellipticals and starbursts when dust extinction is included as a free parameter in the photometric redshift fits .",
    "this indicates a change in the best - fit spectral types of galaxies ( figure 5 ) , depending wether or not we apply the dust extinction correction .",
    "the derived spectral types of elliptical and later type ( spirals , irregulars and starbursts ) galaxies here are examined by comparing them with independently estimated quantitative morphologies ( compactness , asymmetry and gini coefficients ) .",
    "these morphological parameters are consistent with the derived spectral types ( capak _ et al . _   2006 ) .",
    "we now estimate photometric redshifts for 12 agns with @xmath4 , including the prior and extinction . these are compared with their spectroscopic redshifts in figure 8 and",
    "show that the _ rms _ scatter is again lowest when including the prior and correcting for local extinction .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath73 ( table 4 ) .",
    "the small _ rms _ measured for agns ( type ii ) indicates that once extinction fitting is enabled , one can derive their photometric redshifts using templates based on normal galaxies .",
    "in this section we explore how photometric redshifts depend on different techniques , codes and choice of priors , using a variety of photometric redshift codes .",

    "it is run in both maximum likelihood and baysian modes . in the later case , a prior",
    "is calculated in redshift and template space , using an iterative procedure . in the current release of this code , reddening due to dust extinction is not included .",

    "an automatic calibration method is applied by using the spectroscopic redshift sample as training set ( ilbert _ et al .",
    "_   . , 2006 ) .",
    "this adaptive method combines an iterative correction of the photometric zero - points and an optimisation of the sed templates .",
    "it allows to remove systematic differences between the spectroscopic and photometric redshifts and reduce the fraction of catastrophic failures .",
    "reddening correction is applied to templates later than sbc types , using the small magellanic cloud extinction law . in this work",

    "however , the distributions for some codes are slightly offset from @xmath80 , with extended wings .",
    "the absolute accuracy in each code depends on the way the outliers are defined . to directly compare the photometric redshift accuracy from various codes ,",
    "we follow the same procedure for all the four photometric redshift codes and present the results in table 6 ( with no priors ) and table 7 ( with priors ) . for each code",
    ", we calculate the upper and lower 68% intervals ( top - left and top - right number in each grid ) from the distribution of @xmath11 between the photometric and spectroscopic redshifts and between the photometric redshifts from different codes .",
    "this is a different definition than the `` average '' _ rms _ values presented for cosmos photometric redshifts in table 4 and is defined to more clearly show the asymmetry in @xmath81 distributions between different codes .",
    "this also explains the difference in the scatter between photometric and spectroscopic redshifts found here ( tables 6 and 7 ) compared to that listed in table 4 .    assuming a gaussian distribution for @xmath11 values",
    ", that would correspond to 1@xmath82 standard deviation and for symmetric distributions the top - left and the top - right number should be the same .",
    "objects with @xmath11 values outside the 1@xmath82 limit ( bold number in each grid in tables 6 and 7 ) are considered as outliers .",
    "this prescription defines the accuracy independent of the definition of the outliers .    the comparison between the estimated redshifts from various photometric redshift codes with their spectroscopic counterparts are also shown on the first row of tables 6 and 7 .",
    "the rest of the entries present comparison between the different codes .",

    "however , there is a slight improvement in the _ rms _ scatter for cosmos code when using the prior while , prior has no such effect on other codes .",
    "this is likely due to the fact that the prior here was partly optimised on the spectroscopic data , using the photometric data set .",
    "in the previous sections we demonstrated that one could derive reliable photometric redshifts , using the available multi - waveband data for galaxies in cosmos . these are extensively used in the analysis of cosmos dataset . in this section",
    "we present preliminary results , using the photometric redshifts for the entire cosmos galaxies with @xmath83 mag .",
    "given the results in table 4 , we use prior and consider extinction as an independent parameter in the fit .",
    "the photometric redshift distributions for different spectral types of galaxies in cosmos are presented in figure 11 . only galaxies with @xmath13 mag",
    "are used here , as they have the most reliable photometric redshifts . moreover , as discussed in  4.3 , we restrict the sample to galaxies with @xmath4 .",
    "there is similar distribution for all the spectral types with redshift .",
    "the photometric redshift distribution for cosmos ( to @xmath84 ) is compared in figure 12 with the spectroscopic redshift distribution for the vvds to the same depth ( le fevre et al .",
    "2005 ) , after normalising the number of sources to the areas of their respective surveys .",
    "the overall agreement is good , with similar median redshifts .",
    "the vvds only targets 25% of the galaxies to its spectroscopic magnitude limit .",
    "this , combined with the difficulty in measuring spectroscopic redshifts for fainter galaxies in vvds and cosmic variance are responsible for the observed difference between the two distributions in figure 12 .    in figure 13 we present rest - frame absolute magnitudes ( @xmath85 ) for cosmos galaxies .",
    "these are estimated using its best - fit photometric redshift and spectral type , following the prescription described in dahlen _ et al . _   ( 2005 ) . as expected",
    ", there is a trend in @xmath85 absolute magnitudes with spectral types , with objects with earlier types being brighter .",
    "the median absolute magnitudes correspond to @xmath86 ( e / so ) , @xmath87 ( sa / sb ) , @xmath88 ( sc ) , @xmath89 ( starbursts ) .",
    "the stellar mass for cosmos galaxies is measured using the relation between @xmath90 and rest - frame @xmath91 colors @xmath92 bell _ et al . _   ( 2005 ) .",
    "we assume salpeter imf with @xmath93 .",
    "average rest - frame @xmath94 colors , corrected for extinction , are estimated for each spectral type ( e , sa , sb , sc , i m and starburst ) , using the appropriate templates .",
    "then , to each galaxy , using its best - fit spectral type ( which is derived consistently with its estimated extinction and photometric redshift ) , we assign the @xmath94 color and hence , the @xmath90 ratio from the above equation . combined with rest - frame absolute v - band magnitudes ( @xmath85 ) , the stellar mass",
    "is then estimated as @xmath95    k - band luminosities , being produced by evolved stellar population in galaxies , are more directly correlated with the stellar mass in galaxies . however , due to shallowness of our k - band data over the cosmos area , many galaxies are not detected in this band .",
    "therefore , we use the v - band luminosity as a proxy for the k - band to measure the stellar mass . for a sub - set of our galaxies , the stellar masses measured using the k- and v- band luminosities were compared and agree better than 5% . however , by definition , this is a sample dominated by the most massive and reddest galaxies and therefore , this can not be used as a measure of the accuracy for stellar masses for the rest of the galaxies in this sample .",
    "the main source of uncertainty in our stellar mass estimates here is the scatter in the mean @xmath94 colors for each spectral type and the accuracy with which the spectral types are measured for individual galaxies .    in figure 14",
    "we present the distribution of @xmath96 values as a function of spectral type and redshift . in a given redshift range , elliptical and early - type spiral galaxies are more massive than later type galaxies .",
    "however , for a given spectral type of galaxies , we find an increase in galaxy mass with redshift .",
    "this is likely caused by a bias in our magnitude limited sample , due to selecting brighter galaxies at higher redshifts .",
    "we develop a photometric redshift code and use that to measure redshifts and spectral types for galaxies in the cosmos survey .",
    "the technique uses @xmath1 template fitting , combined with luminosity function priors and with the option to estimate internal extinction ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "we use extensive simulations to examine reliability of the code and study its accuracy as a function of photometric magnitude limits and @xmath48 ratios .",
    "we define a new parameter , @xmath3 , to identify the objects with catastrophic failure in photometric redshift estimate .",
    "we estimate photometric redshifts for a sample of 868 galaxies with available spectroscopic redshifts ( to @xmath4 ) from @xmath5cosmos . considering different scenarios , dependeing on using prior and/or extinction",
    ", we compare the photometric and spectroscopic redshifts for this sample .",
