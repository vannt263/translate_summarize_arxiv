    "we will be studying braids using various embedded oriented annuli and bigon discs . by general position",
    "we may assume that @xmath0 intersects our surface of interest @xmath25 transversely in finitely many points , called _ vertices _ , of either positive or negative parity , depending on whether the orientation of @xmath0 agrees or disagrees with the orientation of @xmath25 at that vertex .",
    "provided the boundary components , or boundary arcs , of our surface @xmath25 are transverse to @xmath8-discs in the braid fibration , by standard braid foliation arguments @xcite we may also assume that there are finitely many points of tangency between @xmath25 and the @xmath8-disc fibers , all of which yield simple saddle singularities in the foliation of @xmath25 induced by the braid fibration .",
    "we will generically refer to such points as _ singularities _ , and again these will be of positive or negative parity depending on whether the orientation of @xmath25 agrees or disagrees with the orientation of @xmath8 at those points .    also by standard arguments @xcite ,",
    "the non - singular leaves in the @xmath8-foliation of our discs and annuli will either be _ s - arcs _ whose endpoints are on two different boundary components of an annulus ( or different boundary arcs of a bigon disc ) ; _ a - arcs _ with one endpoint on a vertex and one endpoint on a boundary component or arc ; or _ b - arcs _ whose endpoints are on two different vertices of opposite parity .",
    "furthermore , singular leaves can then be classified as to what non - singular leaves interact to form the saddle singularity ; specifically , in general we will have @xmath26- , @xmath27- , @xmath28- , @xmath29- and @xmath30-singularities .",
    "these are depicted in figure [ fig : tilesb ] , where the oriented transverse boundary is given by bold black arrows ; we will refer to the gray shaded regions as @xmath26- , @xmath27- , @xmath28- , @xmath29- and @xmath30-tiles , classified by the singularity which they contain .",
    "the _ valence _ of a vertex is the number of singular leaves for which it serves as an endpoint ; alternatively the valence is the number of ( one - parameter families of ) @xmath31-arcs or @xmath32-arcs to which the vertex is adjacent .",
    "any vertex may therefore be labeled as type @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath16 are the number of @xmath31-arcs and @xmath32-arcs to which the vertex is adjacent , with the valence of the vertex being @xmath35 .",
    "as discussed in detail in @xcite and shown in figure [ fig : valence123b ] , valence-1 vertices of type @xmath36 indicate a destabilization of the braided boundary of a surface which results in the elimination of that vertex ; valence-2 vertices of type @xmath37 or @xmath38 indicate an exchange move with a corresponding elimination of two vertices ; and valence-3 vertices of type @xmath39 indicate the presence of two consecutive singularities of like parity adjacent to that vertex whose @xmath8-order can be interchanged using braid isotopy , thus reducing the valence of that vertex to 2 .",
    "this re - ordering of consecutive singularities of like parity is referred to as a _ standard change of fibration _",
    " see the bottom right picture in figure [ fig : valence123b ] . as a result , using destabilizations , exchange moves and braid isotopy we can reduce the total number of vertices provided there are such vertices of valence-1 , -2 or -3 .        with this background",
    ", we can now proceed with the proof of proposition [ prop : annuli ] , namely that given braids @xmath9 , then after negative stabilizations of @xmath12 and positive stabilizations of @xmath13 , we obtain two braids @xmath40 which cobound @xmath5 embedded annuli , one for each component of the link type @xmath4 .",
    "we consider @xmath12 and @xmath13 braided about a common axis @xmath0 , and furthermore think of @xmath0 as the @xmath41-axis in @xmath42 , with @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "we begin with @xmath12 and consider a braided push - off @xmath45 of @xmath12 such that @xmath46 and @xmath47 cobound @xmath5 embedded annuli , one for each component of @xmath4 .    now consider a regular braid projection of @xmath47 onto the @xmath48-plane in @xmath49 , and wherever there is a double point at which @xmath45 passes under @xmath12 , we imagine isotoping @xmath45 locally upwards in the @xmath41-direction through @xmath12 .",
    "the result is @xmath50 which is in fact braid isotopic to @xmath45 , but which is now unlinked from @xmath12 , yet still in @xmath49 .",

    "the braid @xmath45 will experience an induced isotopy to a link @xmath58 which continues to cobound with @xmath12 a total of @xmath5 embedded annuli .",
    "similarly , the discs @xmath52 will experience an induced isotopy .",
    "the boundary of each new @xmath52 consists of two arcs , namely @xmath59 and the boundary arc @xmath60 ; see figure [ fig : isotopyb ] .",
    "observe that the braid @xmath12 intersects each disc @xmath52 once close to the @xmath61 boundary arc in @xmath49 . since @xmath59 it is transverse to the @xmath62-fibration .",
    "however , the @xmath61 boundary arc will not necessarily be transverse to the @xmath62-fibration in @xmath56 , although it will still be transverse to the portions of @xmath8-discs in @xmath49 .     and",
    "discs @xmath52 after isotoping @xmath50 to @xmath13 in @xmath56.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    we now apply alexander s theorem for links in @xmath56 so as to make the @xmath61 boundary arcs for the discs @xmath52 transverse to the @xmath62-fibration , and we can do so without changing the conjugacy class of @xmath13 ( @xcite , see also  2 of @xcite ) .",
    "this takes the link @xmath58 to a braid @xmath63 which continues to cobound with @xmath12 a total of @xmath5 embedded annuli .",
    "moreover , we can now realize bigon discs @xmath52 whose braid foliations may be assumed to consist of bands of @xmath64-arcs alternating with regions tiled by @xmath26- , @xmath28- and @xmath27-tiles , with either a single @xmath29-tile serving as a transition between the @xmath64-band and the tiled region , or two @xmath30-tiles serving as the transition on either end of a bigon disc .",
    "we orient each @xmath52 so as to agree with the orientation of the @xmath61 boundary arc , so that @xmath31-arcs along @xmath61 connect to positive vertices , and @xmath31-arcs along @xmath65 connect to negative vertices ; we then work to simplify the foliation of each @xmath52 .",
    "first , consider all singular leaves which intersect the @xmath61 boundary arc ; by slightly perturbing @xmath52 if necessary we may assume @xmath12 does not intersect any such singular leaves .",
    "if any of these singular leaves has its other endpoint on a vertex @xmath66 , we may stabilize the @xmath61 arc along that singular leaf so as to remove that vertex @xmath66 from the foliation of @xmath52 ( see figure [ fig : stabilizesingb ] ) .",
    "along singular leaves if any of these three configurations occur.,scaledwidth=65.0% ]    thus we may assume that all singular leaves which intersect the @xmath61 boundary arc in fact intersect it twice . as a result , if we consider the graph in @xmath52 which consists of singular leaves that connect vertices to vertices , or vertices to one of the boundary arcs @xmath61 or @xmath65 , this graph must be a forest , with the root of each tree on the @xmath65 boundary arc .",
    "in other words , the foliation of each @xmath52 consists of a band of @xmath64-arcs with trees of @xmath26-tiles extending off of it along the @xmath61 boundary arc , with a single @xmath29-tile connecting each tree of the forest to the band of @xmath64-arcs  see the left - hand side of figure [ fig : treeb ] .",
    "whose vertex - singularity graph is a tree after stabilizing @xmath61 ; on the right is @xmath52 whose graph is a linear tree after destabilizing @xmath61.,scaledwidth=65.0% ]    we can now destabilize the @xmath61 boundary arc along each outermost @xmath26-tile containing a valence-1 vertex , as long as it does not contain the point of intersection with @xmath12 ; the result is that each @xmath52 may be assumed to be a linear string of @xmath26-tiles as in the right - hand side of figure [ fig : treeb ] , where the outermost tile farthest from @xmath13 contains the intersection with @xmath12 .",
    "observe that throughout this simplification of the foliation , both @xmath13 and @xmath12 are fixed , and the resulting braid @xmath63 continues to cobound with @xmath12 a total of @xmath5 embedded annuli .",
    "we now examine the resulting linear foliation on a single @xmath52 ; it consists of positive vertices , along with a sequence of singularities .",
    "the result is a twisted band , with the parity of the half - twists given by the signs of the singularities .",
    "it is then evident that if anytime a negative singularity is consecutive with a positive singularity , we may perform an exchange move so as to re - order those two singularities  see figure [ fig : exchangesb ] .",
    "moreover , this exchange move involves an isotopy of @xmath52 which is performed in a regular neighborhood of the sub - disc of @xmath52 cobounded by @xmath61 and the singular leaves associated with the two singularities ; thus the isotopy fixes both @xmath12 , @xmath13 and the other @xmath52 .",

    "the black dots represent intersections of the braid axis @xmath0 with @xmath52.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in this way , we may arrange that all positive singularities are stacked at the @xmath13-end of the foliation of @xmath52 , and all negative singularities are stacked at the @xmath12-end of the foliation of @xmath52 .",
    "we then can negatively destabilize @xmath61 through those singularities , therefore inducing negative stabilizations of @xmath12 to arrive at @xmath15 , as depicted in figures [ fig : destabstabb ] and [ fig : microflypeb ] .",
    "( see ` microflypes ' in  2.3 of @xcite . )",
    "we then observe that stabilizing @xmath13 along the remaining positive singularities and allowing it to pass through @xmath15 will yield @xmath14 which cobounds with @xmath15 a total of @xmath5 embedded annuli .     along with corresponding negative stabilizations of @xmath12 which yield @xmath15.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]     induces a stabilization of @xmath12.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]",
    "before proving theorem [ thm : jones ] , we recall a reformulation of the generalized jones conjecture as described by kawamuro @xcite . to do so , observe that for any braid @xmath6 there is an ordered pair @xmath67 ; we then have the following definition :      in the @xmath68-plane , the cone of @xmath16 indeed has the shape of a cone ; it consists of a lattice of points at or above @xmath67 which are contained within the region bounded by lines of slope + 1 and -1 passing through the point @xmath67 ; see figure [ fig : coneb ] .",
    "suppose for contradiction that there is a @xmath71 whose cone contains points outside the cone of @xmath70 .",
    "then in fact @xmath72 must be outside the cone of @xmath70 .",
    "we assume for the moment that @xmath72 is such that @xmath73 for any @xmath16 in the cone of @xmath70 with @xmath74 .",
    "in other words , as we look at the cone of @xmath70 , we see @xmath12 _ to the left _ of the cone of @xmath70  see figure [ fig : twoconesb ] .",
    "by proposition [ prop : annuli ] there exists @xmath75 such that the @xmath5 components of each braid pairwise cobound @xmath5 embedded annuli , where @xmath76 is obtained from @xmath70 by positively stabilizing , and @xmath15 is obtained from @xmath12 by negatively stabilizing . as a result",
    ", we observe that @xmath15 lies _ to the left and outside of _ the cone of @xmath70 , and @xmath76 lies _ to the right and outside of _ the cone for @xmath12 ; see figure [ fig : twoconesb ] .",
    "our goal in the proof of the current proposition is to use the embedded annuli to find a braid @xmath77 which is obtained from @xmath76 by destabilizations , braid isotopy and exchange moves , and a braid @xmath78 which is obtained from @xmath15 by destabilizations , braid isotopy and exchange moves , such that the cone of @xmath77 equals the cone of @xmath78 . since neither braid isotopy nor exchange moves changes the algebraic length or braid index of a braid , the conclusion is that @xmath79 , which is our desired contradiction since @xmath70 is at minimum braid index .",
    "it is then evident that if we begin with @xmath12 _ to the right _ of the cone of @xmath70 , we can reverse the roles of @xmath80 in proposition [ prop : annuli ] to achieve a similar contradiction .",
    "so it remains to consider a representative annulus @xmath81 cobounded by a component of @xmath76 and a component of @xmath15 .",
    "first , we observe that any @xmath26- or @xmath29- tile must separate from @xmath81 a subdisc @xmath82 which is cobounded by the associated singular leaf and a subarc of a single component of @xmath83 . by an euler characteristic calculation ( lemma 7 of @xcite ) , we are guaranteed that @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the number of vertices of type @xmath33 in @xmath82",
    ". therefore , the tiling of @xmath82 either contains valence-1 vertices which we can remove by destabilizing , or valence-2 or valence-3 vertices which can then be eliminated after braid isotopy and exchange moves .",
    "we may therefore assume that we can always eliminate @xmath26- or @xmath29- tiles .",
    "the result then is an annulus @xmath81 whose foliation consists of @xmath64-bands alternating with bigon discs @xmath86 such that two @xmath30-tiles serve as the transition on either end of each bigon disc .",
    "then by a related euler characteristic calculation ( lemma 6.3.1 of @xcite ) for our annulus @xmath81 , we know that @xmath87 where @xmath88 is twice the number of @xmath64-bands ; furthermore , if both sides equal zero we know that only vertices of type @xmath89 or @xmath90 appear .",
    "if @xmath91 we may therefore eliminate all vertices in the foliation of @xmath81 using braid isotopy , exchange moves and destabilizations , and we obtain an annulus whose foliation consists entirely of @xmath64-arcs .",
    "if this is the case for all of our @xmath5 embedded annuli , then we are done , since the resulting @xmath77 and @xmath78 will have the same braid index and algebraic length .    otherwise , if @xmath92 for some annulus , then again using braid isotopy , exchange moves and destabilizations we either obtain an annulus entirely foliated by @xmath64-arcs ( in which case we are done ) , or an annulus whose foliation is tiled entirely by @xmath28- or @xmath27-tiles in which every vertex is either of type @xmath89 or @xmath90 .",
    "if any of the remaining vertices of type @xmath89 or @xmath90 are adjacent to consecutive singularities of like parity on either end of a one - parameter family of @xmath32-arcs , then we may perform a standard change of fibration to obtain either a vertex of type @xmath37 or @xmath39 which we may then remove following braid isotopy and exchange moves .",
    "we may therefore assume we obtain a tiling in which consecutive singularities around any vertex alternate parity ( see figure [ fig : checkerboardb ] ) .",
    "the tiling of @xmath81 will then be composed of a subannulus of some @xmath51 number of @xmath28-tiles along @xmath77 , and a subannulus of the same @xmath51 number of @xmath28-tiles along @xmath78 , along with @xmath93 subannuli containing @xmath94 number of @xmath27-tiles which interpolate between the subannuli of @xmath28-tiles ; in figure [ fig : checkerboardb ] , @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "however , in this case the resulting braids @xmath77 and @xmath78 will then have the same braid index and algebraic length , and we achieve the desired contradiction . to justify this last statement , observe that if the annulus @xmath81 is oriented so as to agree with @xmath78 , we may stabilize @xmath78 along singular leaves in @xmath81 some @xmath97 number of times to remove all negative vertices in @xmath81 , and then destabilize along valence-1 vertices the same @xmath97 number of times to remove all positive vertices from @xmath81 ; moreover , the parity of all of these stabilizations and destabilizations are identical , and thus @xmath98 ."
