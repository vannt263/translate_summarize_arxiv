    "chemically peculiar ( cp ) stars is a well know group of anomalous stars on the upper main sequence ( see e.g. romanyuk 2007 , wahlgren 2004 for the most recent reviews ) .",
    "it is generally accepted that the slow rotation of these stars is the primordial cause of the am and ap peculiarity .",
    "slow rotation translates into the low rotationally induced mixing and stable atmospheres void of disturbing turbulence .",
    "then radiatively driven microscopic diffusion takes over and drives a vertical or horizontal stratification of chemical elements and observed abundance anomalies . at low effective temperatures",
    "cp phenomenon disappears due to the deep convection zones , at hotter temperatures it is because of the strong stellar winds .",
    "large scale magnetic fields , if present , can strongly affect the diffusion , observed abundance anomalies , and differentiate between the magnetic ap and nonmagnetic am stars .",
    "slow rotation is due to the magnetic breaking in single magnetic stars or tidal synchronization in binary stars .    with this picture in mind",
    "one can explain many of the fundamental observed properties of am stars :    * the slow rotation with the cutoff of about 100 km / s ; * abundance anomalies decreasing with the rotational velocity ; * high fraction of close binaries in am stars ; * absence of am binaries with very short orbital periods ( @xmath0 days , such systems rotate above the 100 km / s cutoff due to the spin - orbit synchronization and , thus , the abundance anomalies disappear ) .",
    "nevertheless , there are inconsistencies and potential problems with the above mentioned standard picture in which rotation and diffusion play a unique role . the picture invokes tidal breaking , synchronization , circularization but ignores tidal effects on the stellar magneto - hydrodynamics and mixing .",
    "it assumes that am stars rotate as single stars while most of them are close binaries .",
    "could it be that the am anomalies depend primarily on the orbital period or eccentricity which , in close binaries , strongly correlate with the rotation and this is why we observe a correlation with the rotation ? could it be that the correlation of am anomalies with the rotation and the rotation cutoff velocity are not due to the rotationally induced mixing but due to the tidal mixing which might depend on the degree of the pseudo - synchronization and thus on the rotation ?",
    "could it be that the absence of short period am binaries is not due to their high rotation but due to the enhanced mixing and flows in the strongly irradiated tidally distorted star with the surface approaching the roche lobe ?",
    "to our knowledge nobody has ruled out such options so far .",
    "there are more problems which is difficult to explain within the standard picture .",
    "budaj ( 1996 , 1999 ) , feovk et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , and references therein studied the am and ap anomalies as a function of rotation and orbital elements .",
    "they found evidences that the properties of am and ap binaries depend on their orbital elements ( some of them were questioned by noels et al .",
    "it was suggested that the tidal effects in binary systems and a complex interplay between the binarity , rotation and magnetism play crucial role in driving the cp phenomenon and are more ` far - reaching ' than originally though .",
    "there is a clear evidence of the enhanced li abundances in the cool late type dwarfs and giants in close binaries indicating very different mixing in the envelopes of a tidally locked star than in a single star ( spite et al .",
    "1994 , costa et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the tidal mechanism of slowing down the rotation of an am star is not well understood so far .",
    "there are two very different theories for the tidal synchronization and circularization . the dynamical tide theory of zahn ( 1977 ) and the hydrodynamical mechanism of tassoul & tassoul ( 1992 ) .",
    "the first mechamism can synchronize the spin of stars with radiative envelopes for orbital periods up to a few days .",
    "the latter is much more efficient and could reduce the stellar rotation up to orbital periods of 100 days .",
    "spin - orbit synchronization was typically observed in a v type binaries for orbital period of a few days .",
    "there is a tendency for pseudo - synchronization of am binaries for orbital periods up to 30 days ( budaj 1996 ) .",
    "however , recently abt & boonyarak ( 2004 ) concluded that in ba iv or v binaries with periods as long as about 500 days , the rotational velocities of the primaries are reduced relative to the primaries in wider binaries and single stars which is due to tidal effects .",
    "abt ( 2005 ) found out that binaries with b0-f0 iv or v primaries with intermediate orbital periods ( 10-100 days ) lack highly eccentric orbits and that there is a tendency for circularization for periods up to about 1000 days .",
    "thus , there is no reason to believe that the magneto - hydrodynamics in a member of the close binary is the same as in the single star .",
    "consequently , the observed properties of am stars mentioned in the previous section can not be considered as a proof of this standard text book explanation of the am phenomenon and need to be revisited .",
    "apart from the obvious dependence of the am phenomenon on the mass , age ( effective temperature , gravity ) and rotation the dependence on the orbital elements has to be studied also and the strong correlations between the rotation , orbital period and eccentricity need to be properly addressed and taken into account .",
    "a more detail study of am stars in binary systems involving the abundance analysis , determination of the orbital parameters , masses , radii , rotation , ages , and studies of synchonization and circularization are thus very important .",
    "recently , there have been a number of such studies .",
    "budaj & iliev ( 2003 ) studied three a - type binaries and concluded that hd33254 is pronounced am star , hd198391 is extremely sharp - lined hot am star , and hd178449 is not am star and that there is a faint sharp - lined secondary spectrum . the original orbit based on",
    "the photographic data turned out to be wrong .",
    "iliev et al .",
    "( 2004 ) observed a few dozen sb1 am binaries hunting for the sb2 systems .",
    "they detected the secondary spectra and estimated mass ratios in hd434 , hd861 , hd108642 , and hd216608 . in the last star they in fact observed three spectra and concluded that the previous orbit based on photographic data was misinterpreted and wrongly assigned to the visual a component of the system .",
