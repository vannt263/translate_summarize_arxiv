    "in the standard picture of galactic structure , most galaxies harbour a central super - massive black hole ( smbh ) , which is quiet in normal galaxies and responsible for quasar and seyfert activities in active galaxies .",
    "but the building process of smbhs is still not fully understood .",
    "is the way of creating a smbh with more than @xmath1 a direct collapse of a gas cloud , is it the growth of a small seed black hole in a dense star cluster , or is it the remnant of a hypernova of a super massive star like object ( sms ) ?    in the building process of a smbh two basic paths can be distinguished ( rees @xcite ) . at the stellar dynamical path",
    "the gas cloud initially forms a massive central star cluster or bulge .",
    "stellar and dynamical evolution including star - star collisions than form a seed black hole with initial mass up to @xmath2 .",
    "subsequently this black hole grows by accretion of gas and stars . here",
    "the basic problem of the growth is the feeding rate .",
    "only a very small fraction of stars have highly excentric orbits to reach the tidal radius of the black hole and refilling this loss - cone is a complicated matter ( for details see amaro - seoane & spurzem @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the gas dynamical path starts also with a collapsing gas cloud , but here the cloud collapses directly to a highly condensed gas ball .",
    "the lifetime of this super - massive object is very short ( see section [ sms1 ] ) such that star formation in this condensed phase does not occur .",
    "the dynamical collapse can go on to end up with a smbh , or it can reach a hydrostatic state , which than contracts by radiative cooling .",
    "we call a gas ball with mass @xmath3 in hydrostatic equilibrium a super - massive star ( sms ) .",
    "it is not proofed that a direct collapse is possible , because explosive hydrogen burning would destroy more or less the whole object .",
    "even the final collapse of a sms , which becomes unstable due to the post - newtonian instability , will be stopped by hydrogen burning ( fuller  @xcite ) .    in a more realistic scenario of galaxy formation , a central bulge or dense star cluster",
    "will form first , and at a later stage there will occur strong gas infall initiated by a galaxy merging process or a bar instability . in this case",
    "the super - massive gaseous object will not be isolated and interaction processes with the star cluster can change the evolution dramatically .",
    "hara ( @xcite ) showed in an analytic approximation , that heating of the sms by drag forces of the stars crossing the sms can stop the contraction for some time . in a numerical simulation langbein ( @xcite ) showed that the energy input due to star - star collisions can dominate over heating by drag forces and leads to a rebounce of the sms .    in the next section",
    "we give an overview over the properties of a sms and in section [ sms2 ] we discuss the interaction processes of the sms with the surrounding star cluster in a more complete way .",
    "in a sms radiation pressure @xmath4 dominates strongly over thermal pressure @xmath5 , the fraction of which is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the mass in units of @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 is independent of radius ( @xmath10 given in @xmath11 ) and does not change during contraction of the sms . for @xmath12",
    "the structure of the sms is very near to a n=3 polytrope , which is the stability limit with zero total energy .",
    "the sms is determined by mass @xmath13 and radius @xmath14 .",
    "the central temperature @xmath15 , central density @xmath16 , gravitational and total energy ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) are given by @xmath19 respectively .",
    "the contraction rate of the sms is determined by the eddington luminosity @xmath20 leading to a contraction time @xmath21 in parameter space ( the @xmath22-plane ) , the regime of hydrostatic , stable equilibrium ( where a sms can exist ) is bounded at the high radius end ( at @xmath23 ) where the kelvin - helmholtz time @xmath24 ( contraction time ) equals the free fall time . at the low radius end",
    "it is bounded by the post - newtonian instability ( @xmath25 ) or for lower masses when nuclear burning at the centre sets in ( @xmath26 ) . in figure [ fig1 ] the relevant regime for a sms",
    "the schwarzschild radius @xmath27 is far below the living region of a sms .",
    "the evolutionary tracks are horizontal lines from right to left .",
    "the contraction time is also plotted showing that without re - heating the lifetime of the sms is at most @xmath28 before nuclear burning or the post - newtonian collapse sets in .",
    "in the central region of young galaxies with sms both , stellar and gas densities , are very high exceeding @xmath29 . therefore the interaction rate of stars is very high and drag forces of loss - cone stars ( this are the stars crossing the sms ) can drive the evolution considerably . earlier investigations",
    "( hara @xcite , langbein  @xcite ) show that the timescale for dynamical coupling of the stellar system with the gas and for heating by stellar collisions is comparable or even shorter than the lifetime of a sms .",
    "here we concentrate on the star - gas interaction and discuss the effects on the structure and evolution of the sms .",
    "stars moving through the gas produce density and velocity perturbations by gravitational forces and the geometrical cross section .",
    "the consequences of these local perturbations on the global behaviour of the sms can be consistently estimated using a quasi - linear perturbation theory . in this method",
    ", all physical quantities are decomposed into a local mean value and a perturbation ( @xmath30 for the gas density e.g. ) .",
    "then the time dependent perturbations are computed from the set of linearised equations and finally the quasistationary fluctuation field of the nonlinear quantities as functions of the mean quantities are derived by taking the statistical average over all stars .",
    "dynamical friction between stars and gas is given by @xmath31 with gravitational potential @xmath32 ( see just  @xcite ) .",
    "the level of approximation is similar to that of using chandrasekhars dynamical friction formula .",
    "the advantage of the fluctuation theory is that the turbulent velocity field , corrections to the equation of state and to radiation transfer can all be derived consistently .",
    "it is also straightforward to include all relevant physical processes in the gas like radiation pressure , heating and cooling processes , viscosity or even magnetic fields .",
    "the structure of the sms is determined by hydrostatic equilibrium and a stationary radiation field in the diffusion limit .",
    "these assumptions are not automatically valid for the perturbations , because here the length and timescales are much shorter . the perturbations are time dependent and it depends on the scale , whether the radiation field will be compressed also .",
    "the character of the perturbations will be between the two extremes :    isothermal : :    in small scale fluctuations the inhomogeneities of the radiation field    diffuse quickly away . since the temperature is determined by the    radiation ,",
    "the compression of the gas is isothermal and the sound    speed relevant for determining the mach number of the stellar motion    is the usual isothermal sound speed ( @xmath33    for a million solar mass sms with radius @xmath34 ) .",
    "most    stars are highly supersonic in this case .",
    "adiabatic : :    larger fluctuations , where the radiation field is also compressed , are    adiabatic .",
    "the mach number is a factor of @xmath35    smaller than in the isothermal case .",
    "it is determined by the total    pressure leading to typical mach numbers of order unity for the stars .",
    "the resultant density and velocity fluctuations of the gas and the variations in the radiation field change the mean local properties of the sms systematically . in the sms basically three different effects of the fluctuations can be important :    dynamical heating : :    the energy loss of the stars by dynamical friction heats the sms in    the inner region .",
    "the heating rate depends on the relative masses and    densities of the star cluster and the sms , and of the filling factor    of the loss cone , which is a complicated matter to estimate .",
    "if the    heating rate exceeds the cooling of the sms , then the contraction can    be stalled for a while .",
    "mass segregation : :    dynamical friction leads also to mass segregation of the stars .",
    "loss    cone stars become confined to the sms .",
    "this happens , if the friction    timescale @xmath36 becomes smaller than the contraction    time @xmath24 . in figure [ fig1 ]",
    "an estimation of    @xmath36 is shown and also the coupling radius    @xmath37 of the sms for stars with an initial velocity    of 5000 km / s . in more compact sms loss - cone stars",
    "are effectively    stopped by dynamical friction . since dynamical friction",
    "has its    maximum just above the sound speed , confined stars will be decelerated    quickly below the sound speed building a new highly condensed stellar    core",
    ". then the question is , whether this new core can decouple from    the surrounding to build a new smaller sms - star cluster system with    higher density .",
    "equation of state : :    the turbulent velocity field and non - isothermal density fluctuations    change the relative contribution of radiation pressure .",
    "this results    in a different mean @xmath38 of the form    @xmath39    which stabilises the sms",
    ". additionally the direct influence of the    inhomogeneities on radiation transfer may generally destroy the    @xmath0 behaviour of the sms .",
    "then the post - newtonian    instability can not occur .    as a bottom line we find , that the interaction of the stellar component and the sms can give rise to a secular evolution away from the unstable zero - energy state to a more stable structure",
    ". additionally mass segregation may lead to a decoupling of the core region resulting in a sequence of sms , the smaller and more compact ones nested in the larger ones . in order to show , whether this kind of evolution can happen , we will do detailed semi - analytical model calculations .",
