    ", the position of the optical fold arc agrees with the position of the putative co(32 ) detection to within the latter s astrometric uncertainties ( see table [ t - pos ] ) .",
    "following @xcite , we have calculated these uncertainties as the sum of three terms in quadrature : 1 .   the @xmath58 absolute uncertainty of the pdbi reference frame ;",
    "this stems from the fundamental uncertainties of quasar positions .",
    "2 .   the relative uncertainty introduced by using a calibrator ( 3c345 ) that is offset by @xmath59 from cb58 . in principle ,",
    "this uncertainty is about @xmath60 per degree of separation , i.e. , @xmath61 .",

    "for cb58 , lying between 3c345 and 1504 + 377 , we can then impose the somewhat tighter limit of @xmath65 .",
    "3 .   the accuracy of our centroiding , which aips indicates is @xmath66 in right ascension and @xmath67 in declination . this term dominates the other two .",

    "uv photospheric absorption features that are blueward of the @xcite @xmath54 by @xmath68 in the rest frame of the source ( see table [ t - z ] ) . from fits to the co line profile ( see below ) , we estimate a @xmath69 , whose @xmath70 blueshift relative to @xmath54 agrees fairly well with the rest ",
    "uv results .",
    "we do not view the consistent difference from @xmath54 as necessarily astrophysically significant ; if @xmath71 were to arise largely in a wind , for example , we would expect @xmath54 to be _ lower _ than @xmath72 , contrary to what is seen",
    ". the discrepancy may rather reflect simple uncertainties in wavelength calibration .",

    "second , we see no sign of a velocity gradient in the co(32 ) data cube ; this negative result is consistent with the absence of any shear along the arc in rest ",
    "uv observations of higher spatial resolution @xcite .",
    "finally , the lack of obvious 1 mm continuum emission at the position of the putative co(32 ) line ( above a @xmath73 upper limit of 1.2mjy ) agrees with the results of @xcite , who report a 250ghz continuum flux density for cb58 of 1.06mjy .",
    "adopting their suggested @xmath76 dust temperature and @xmath77 dust emissivity index , the 217.8ghz flux density expected in our pdbi map would be only 0.68mjy ( see also  [ ss - xor ] ) .    given this identification , we proceed to calculate the parameters of the co(32 ) emission in cb58 .",
    "while figure [ f - cbmap ] gives a fair estimate of the flux in the core of the line ( @xmath78 ) , it fails to account for additional emission in the line wings extending blueward and redward of this particular @xmath50 chunk of the spectrum .",
    "we have therefore fit gaussians to the line profile through the brightest pixel in figure [ f - cbmap ] , as extracted from versions of the original @xmath40 cube that have been rebinned to @xmath79 resolution and corrected for primary beam attenuation ( e.g. , figure [ f - cbspec ] ) . to estimate the uncertainties in the line widths and intensities",

    "in addition to @xmath81 , we estimate a total line flux @xmath82 and a velocity dispersion @xmath83 ( equivalently , @xmath84 ) .    in the 1 mm data cube",
    ", we have summed putative co(76 ) channels over a @xmath50 velocity interval within @xmath85 of that integrated to produce figure [ f - cbmap ] . at the position of the co(32 ) peak ,",
    "no co(76 ) emission is seen ; the nominal line flux is @xmath86 .",
    "for a fair estimate of the co(76)/co(32 ) integrated intensity ratio @xmath87 , however , we must allow for the possibility that relative weakness in the co(76 ) line can partly result from a relative lack of @xmath35 sampling at short @xmath88 , @xmath89 denoting the projected baseline length .",
    "we have therefore truncated both of the original co(32 ) and co(76 ) @xmath35 datasets below an identical minimum @xmath90 , and reinverted them with natural weighting . after correcting for primary beam attenuation and convolving the new co(76 ) map to the @xmath91 ( p.  a. @xmath92 ) beam of the new co(32 ) map",
    ", we take their quotient . in flux units , the line ratio in a small region centered on the position of the co(32 ) line detection is then @xmath93 .",
    "translated to brightness temperature units , this yields a nominal integrated intensity ratio @xmath94 the lack of co(76 ) emission in a noisy 1 mm map means that this value may not be a particularly meaningful upper limit .",
    "however , we can safely conclude that there is no evidence for large amounts of warm , dense molecular gas in cb58 like those observed in the submillimeter galaxy smmj14011 + 0252 at a similar redshift @xcite .    to evaluate",
    "whether the width and intensity of the co(32 ) line in cb58 are consistent with what we would expect for a relatively unobscured starburst , we must compare it to the parameters of co(32 ) emission observed in appropriate @xmath4 analogues .",
    "@xcite report single  pointing co(32 ) observations of a wide range of galaxy types ; however , a better comparison sample is that of @xcite , who have mapped the co(32 ) line across the disks of twelve nearby starburst and star  forming galaxies .",
    "the most revealing quantity for comparison with cb58 is the beam  diluted brightness temperature @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the areal filling factor of a galaxy s molecular clouds and @xmath97 is the rest  frame brightness temperature of a single cloud .",

    "uv continuum emission ( i.e. , molecular clouds and the stars forming from them ) are very similar , so that @xmath108 . by the same token , since model mvia of s98 implies that the background lbg lensed into the cb58 arc has semi  major axes @xmath109 , we can assume @xmath110 . for @xmath111 and",

    "this value falls near those seen in the centers of m51 ( 0.4 ) , ngc278 ( 0.6 ) , and ngc4631 ( 0.8 ) in the @xcite sample .",
    "the agreement of @xmath95 estimates for cb58 and three nearby star  forming galaxies",
    "is strictly empirical in particular , we have not ( yet ) invoked any relationship between @xmath113 and molecular gas mass and has three general implications .",
    "first , the consistency gives tentative support to our assumption that the system s rest  uv continuum and co line emission are identically lensed ; there is no order  of  magnitude discrepancy that can only be accounted for by differential lensing .",
    "second , it appears entirely plausible that cb58 contains molecular clouds whose distribution ( i.e. , @xmath96 ) and typical internal conditions ( i.e. , @xmath97 ) overlap with the ranges seen in local star  forming galaxy populations .",
    "a stronger formulation of this point is not warranted , given that the relative weighting of @xmath96 and @xmath97 in the product of both could still differ at high and low redshift .",
    "finally , the molecular ism in cb58 does not appear to resemble that of an ultra  luminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg ) merger .",
    "five of the six ulirg molecular disks from which @xcite detect co(32 ) emission have co(10 ) line widths measured by @xcite and intrinsic co(10 ) and/or co(21 ) source sizes inferred by @xcite . assuming that these systems @xmath114 and @xmath115 are similar for all co transitions , we estimate values for their @xmath95 in the range @xmath116 . by the same token , the parameters of co(32 ) emission in the lensed ir  luminous galaxy f10214 + 4724 ( @xmath117 ) mapped by downes , solomon , & radford ( 1995 ) imply @xmath118 a factor of 20 larger than in cb58 .      the co(10 ) line luminosity is well established as a proxy for the total gas mass gravitationally bound in a galaxy s molecular clouds ( dickman et al .",

    "although @xmath121 applies reasonably well for molecular clouds in the galaxy and in the disks of nearby spirals @xcite , for galaxies with subsolar metallicity the universality of the conversion factor is a contested issue . @xcite and",
    "arimoto , sofue , & tsujimoto ( 1996 ) argue that @xmath122 rises for lower ",
    "metallicity systems ; averaging their recommended values for the metallicity of cb58 , which we take to be @xmath123 from @xcite , would imply @xmath124 .",
    "in contrast , @xcite find no systematic trend of @xmath125 with metallicity in the range @xmath126 across the disk of m33 , while @xcite report @xmath127 for the @xmath128 smc , considerably smaller than the @xcite and @xcite relations would predict . to reflect the range of these results , we adopt @xmath129 for cb58 in this paper .    next , we must estimate cb58 s integrated intensity ratio @xmath130 .",
    "@xcite report values ranging from 0.4 to 1.4 in the centers , and from 0.5 to 1.0 in the disks , of their sample of twelve galaxies .",

    "we make no correction for the atomic mass component of cb58 s ism , although we note that in low  metallicity systems , a large fraction of the gas that is gravitationally bound into the `` molecular '' clouds traced by the co lines ( and thus readily available for star formation ) may already be atomic in phase .",
    "cb58 s molecular gas mass is comparable to those seen in the more gas  rich members of the local spiral population ( e.g. , helfer et al .",
    "2003 ) , somewhat smaller than those seen in nearby ulirgs ( bryant & scoville 1999 ; cf .",
    "downes & solomon 1998 ) , and up to an order of magnitude less than those inferred for submillimeter  selected systems at comparably high @xmath136 @xcite .",

    "its irregular velocity `` profile '' ( figure [ f - xspec ] ) does not permit a detailed fit for an exact centroid or width , although it is clear that the latter must be comparable to the bandwidth smoothed to obtain the center panel of figure [ f - xmap ] .",
    "such a @xmath199 velocity width is incompatible with the @xmath200 velocity dispersion for the cd required by the s98 lensing model ; moreover , a rest frequency @xmath201 does not correspond to any strong recombination line ( towle , feldman , & watson 1996 ) or molecular rotational transition .",
    "we therefore adopt the reverse strategy of assuming x is one of the strongest extragalactic emission lines i.e. , a co rotational transition and asking whether an object at the corresponding redshift can provide a self  consistent explanation . as co(10 ) emission , x would necessarily come from a @xmath202 galaxy lying in front of the cluster .",
    "the only possible candidate is the foreground spiral `` s '' seen @xmath203 southeast of x , which s98 suggest has @xmath204 on the basis of its angular size and @xmath205 color .",
    "however , its apparently face  on orientation makes a @xmath206 linewidth highly implausible , particularly at a radius @xmath207 from the center of a spiral that would otherwise appear to be co  poor .    as co(21 ) emission from a @xmath208 galaxy or co(32 ) emission from a ( further ) @xmath209 galaxy , x would lie behind the lensing cluster and therefore undergo some degree of magnification .",
    "a significant challenge for this scenario is that any background source producing an image within an arcsecond of the central cd should also produce a number of counterimages ( over the same velocity range ) elsewhere in the cluster field .",
    "velocity considerations alone mean x can not be co(32 ) emission from a fifth image in the w set of s98 , since here the background source redshift lies only @xmath210 from that of cb58 ( teplitz , malkan & mclean 2002 ) . to explore the possibility that x is co(21 ) or co(32 ) emission from a hitherto unknown background source , we have implemented the s98 lensing model within the _ gravlens _ package @xcite .",
    "as discussed in appendix [ a - lens ] , we have then assumed that x is one image of a lensed background point source and calculated where the corresponding counterimages should lie for both @xmath211 and @xmath212 .",

    "we do consider @xmath213 a more appealing possibility than @xmath214 , since we already know that cb58 and the background source producing the w image set lie at about the same redshift @xcite . the projected separation between the background galaxies lensed to produce cb58 and x would be only @xmath215 in this case ; the presence of an additional , more obscured and gas  rich companion that could have helped trigger cb58 s star formation recalls the multiple  component morphology of the lbg westphal ",

    "this combination of properties requires a significant , perhaps fatal degree of fine tuning .",
    "there are two ways in which the presence of source x within @xmath192 of cb58 on the sky might lead us to adjust the properties of the emission we attribute to the lbg .",
    "the first is the prospect that continuum ( or broad line ) emission from x has contaminated our measurements of the co(32 ) emission line within the pdbi data cube .",
    "this turns out not to be a problem .",
    "if we treat x as line emission , then the best estimate of its velocity centroid and width ( see figure [ f - xspec ] ) place it mostly blueward of cb58 s co(32 ) emission , and the positional offset suppresses any remaining contamination .",
    "if we treat x as nonthermal continuum from the cd and subtract a model of the line  free channels from the @xmath35 data before inverting a now `` line  only '' cube , we measure co(32 ) line parameters for cb58 that are virtually identical to those derived in ",
    "[ s - cb58 ] without the benefit of `` continuum subtraction '' ( e.g. , the peak in figure [ f - cbmap ] nominally increases from @xmath218 to @xmath219 ) .",
    "the second possible problem is that if x is continuum emission from the cd or line emission from a dusty background source , there may be some contamination of the 1.2 mm and @xmath183 dust emission attributed to cb58 by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the amount of dust that could be associated with a lensed line source is difficult to quantify .",
    "the possible contamination by nonthermal continuum from the cd is more tractable : assuming @xmath181 and accounting for the different mambo and scuba beam sizes , we would estimate that roughly 0.22mjy of each detection could have come from the cd .",

    "to the extent that this has occurred , the weaker dust emission attributed to cb58 would support the conclusion of @xcite that the galaxy s long  wavelength sed differs from those of local starbursts , although this difference would still be less dramatic than past ( over)estimates of its rest  uv reddening have suggested @xcite .",

    "the complexity of the s98 model , which is tightly constrained by a number of multiply imaged sources in the cluster field , makes a detailed examination prohibitive .",

    "its high gas mass fraction agrees with theoretical predictions that @xmath157 should increase with redshift .",
    "the duration of cb58 s current star formation episode appears to be long relative to the redshift range probed by the lyman break technique at @xmath371 ; this argues for a high duty cycle for star formation , and against scenarios in which the halo hosting an observed lbg is over time `` lit up '' by many different objects undergoing brief bursts",

    "our model specifies that the image of a point source at a2 has undergone a factor of 2.38 magnification , in excellent agreement with the factor of 2.39 estimated by s98 .",
    "our model also predicts that two additional images of the same background source should appear at the locations marked by filled circles in figure [ f - s98 ] , i.e. , within the cb58 arc .",
    "exact reproduction of the arc produced by an intrinsically extended ( rather than point ) background source is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we have also checked that the projected mass density specified by our reparametrization of the s98 lensing model can roughly account for the positions and magnifications of the additional ( b , c , and w ) sets of multiple images in this field . because the corresponding background sources do not necessarily lie at the same @xmath390 as cb58 , it is necessary to apply a further rescaling to the deflection potential for each one .",

    "the derived image positions shown in figure [ f - s98 ] are in generally good agreement with the data , although _ gravlens _ predicts that there should be one additional image each of both the c and the w background sources ( only the latter is predicted by s98 ) .",
    "note that the assumption of @xmath407 ( see below ) fixes @xmath408 in our cosmology .    in exploring the possibility that source x could be gravitationally lensed co(21 ) emission from a source at @xmath409 or co(32 ) emission from a source ( other than cb58 ) at @xmath213 ( see  [ ss - xor ] above ) , the strongest constraint is imposed by the absence of counterimages within the 50% response of the pdbi primary beam at 92.96ghz ( see , e.g. , the lower panel of figure [ f-2lens ] ) .",
    "indeed , the second  strongest feature in the entire map is a @xmath410 peak lying @xmath411 to the southeast of x ( not shown ) , where the primary beam response is only @xmath412 .",
    "if this were a true counterimage , its implied flux density of @xmath413 would require that it be more highly magnified than x by a factor between 15 and 36 an unlikely situation at a position where the lens model predicts only a single image and a magnification @xmath414 for either choice of @xmath216 .",
    "the counterimages of x that the model does predict lie at much smaller radii . for both @xmath409 and @xmath213 ,",
    "we have used _ gravlens _ to predict the image positions and magnifications that result if we place x at each of the nine grid points defined by @xmath415 in terms of the astrometric uncertainties listed in table [ t - pos ] . typically , we find x has one or more counterimages that are at least as strongly magnified , far enough away not to be confused with x , and close enough to our phase center that they would hardly suffer any primary beam attenuation .",
    "such counterimages would be detected if they existed at all ; their absence instantly invalidates the particular models in which they appear .    in a few cases",
    ", the lensing geometry can conspire to place x and a bright counterimage x2 close to each other on opposite sides of a critical curve .",
