    "damped ly@xmath0 systems ( hereafter , dlas ) contain most of the atomic hydrogen in the universe ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "they are therefore fundamental objects to understand galaxy formation : in the process of forming galaxies , the matter that is originally in the low - density , ionized intergalactic medium must invariably become first atomic , before it can form molecular clouds and stars .",
    "the nature and geometrical shape of the dlas is still a subject of debate .",
    "the two alternative hypotheses that are being discussed at present and confronted with the observations are as follows : ( a ) they are rotating disks , which may or may not be forming stars ; ( b ) they are approximately spherical halos , where global rotation contributes little to the support against gravity .",
    "the truth may be a combination of these two possibilities : dlas might be described as flattened halos or thick disks , with a range of the ratio of rotation velocity to velocity dispersion .",
    "a fundamental property of dlas is that their associated metal lines reveal the presence of multiple absorbers in most of the systems , which are thought to arise from clumps of gas .",
    "the multiple absorption lines appear over velocity intervals of @xmath8 to @xmath9 .",
    "the statistical properties of the multiple absorption lines have been used to attempt to distinguish between the disk and halo models , but both alternatives seem to be consistent with observations ( @xcite ) . although the observations reveal that there are usually one or a few clumps intersected along a random line of sight , with characteristic column densities of @xmath10 , the size of the clumps is not well known .",
    "constraints in a few systems from double lines of sight in lensed qso s , and from model calculations of the ionization parameter , indicate sizes or structure in the range of 20 pc to 1 kpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "models of structure formation predict that the overall size of dlas is of the order of 1 to 10 kpc ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if the clump size is not much smaller than the size of dlas , then the absorption lines would actually be arising from mild fluctuations in density and velocity in a turbulent medium ; whereas if the clump sizes are much smaller , they would be real separate entities with a large overdensity relative to an interclump medium .",
    "this paper discusses the effects of self - shielding on the form of the column density distribution of damped ly@xmath0 systems , and the dependence of this distribution on the size of the gas clumps .",
    "as the gas becomes self - shielding against the external cosmic ionizing background , there is a rapid transition from ionized to fully atomic gas , and this causes a feature in the column density distribution .",
    "if @xmath2 is the neutral fraction of the gas seen at a column density @xmath11 ( where the optical depth to photons at the hydrogen ionization edge is equal to one ) , a hump in the column density distribution will occur at @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , a measurement of @xmath2 from this feature in the column density distribution , combined with an independent estimate of the ionizing background intensity , can be used to infer the size of the gas clumps .",
    "observationally , compared with the expected number extropolated from low column density distributions , an excess of absorption systems with @xmath13 is found by @xcite .",
    "the recent compilation of the column density distribution of known dlas by @xcite shows more clearly a hump around @xmath14 . theoretically , based on an approximate calculation of the self - shielding effect , @xcite showed that a flat part appears in the column density distribution . with a simplified consideration on the ionizing flux transfer , @xcite investigated models of self - gravitating , photoionized , spherical gaseous cloud and explained the flattening of the column density distribution at @xmath15 as the effect of self - shielding .",
    "similar calculations of the expected column density distribution due to self - shielding have been done by @xcite for plane - parallel geometry .    here , we will consider a spherical geometry with a singular isothermal profile to perform a self - shielding calculation , and focus on the application of inferring the size of the gas clumps in damped ly@xmath0 systems .",
    "we model a dla as a spherical cloud of gas with a singular isothermal profile , @xmath16 , with a cutoff at the virial radius , where @xmath17 is the gas density .",
    "the model depends only on the constant @xmath18 , which can be recast in terms of the mass of an associated virialized dark matter halo .",
    "we will be presenting results for dark matter halo masses of @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , assuming that 5% of the mass of the halo is in the form of gas .",
    "for the cosmological model with @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and at @xmath25 , the virial radii corresponding to these halo masses are @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and the halo circular velocities are @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in cold dark matter models of structure formation",
    ", the damped ly@xmath0 systems should be located in halos over this range of masses ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the constant @xmath18 is simply determined by the condition that 5% of the halo mass is equal to the total gas mass within radius @xmath30 .",
    "the model ignores clumpiness of the gas , but as discussed later the results depend only on the assumed radius at a given density , so the halo radius will essentially play the role of the radius of a clump .",
    "the other quantity that determines the profile of neutral hydrogen is the intensity of the external ionizing background .",
    "we assume an intensity of @xmath31 , constant at all frequencies between the @xmath32 lyman limit , @xmath33 , and the lyman limit , @xmath34 .",
    "the intensity is set to zero at frequencies above @xmath34 .",
    "this is a sufficiently good approximation for our purpose to the background spectrum expected from qsos , after absorption by the ly@xmath0 forest is taken into account ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the reason is that becomes self - shielding at a larger radius in the gaseous halo than ( owing to the faster recombination rate and the lower intensity of the cosmic background at the lyman limit , compared to hydrogen ; e.g. , @xcite ) , and therefore the photons at frequency above @xmath34 in the cosmic background are absorbed before reaching the region where opacity is important . with this spectrum",
    ", our adopted value of the intensity at the lyman limit corresponds to a photoionization rate @xmath35 .    in our calculation",
    ", we will set the total hydrogen number density to @xmath36 ( where @xmath37 is the mass of the hydrogen atom ) , and the electron number density to @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the hydrogen neutral fraction .",
    "the factors 0.76 and 0.82 assume a helium abundance of @xmath40 by weight , and that all the helium is in the form of @xmath41 and @xmath42 with the same neutral fraction as hydrogen .",
    "other than these factors , the presence of helium is ignored in our calculation .",
    "this is a good enough approximation owing to the small helium abundance by number , plus the fact that every photoionization of produces a photon following recombination of which ionizes hydrogen .      we compute the self - shielded density profile using an iterative procedure similar to the one described by @xcite .",
    "photoionization equilibrium demands that at each radius , we have @xmath43 ^ 2\\ , { 0.82\\rho_g(r)\\over m_h}\\ , \\alpha_b(t ) ~,\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the hydrogen neutral fraction at radius @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the cosmic background intensity , @xmath47 is the photoionization optical depth from radius @xmath45 to infinity along a given direction , @xmath48 is the photoionization cross section of hydrogen , and @xmath49 is the case b recombination coefficient at temperature @xmath50 ( we use the on - the - spot approximation , see @xcite ) .",
    "we fix the temperature to @xmath51 k , for which the recombination coefficient is @xmath52 ( @xcite ) .",
    "one can compute self - consistently the gas temperature assuming thermal equilibrium under photoionization conditions , but in practice the gas is likely to be frequently shock - heated in any model of moving gas clumps in a halo . to numerically evaluate the integral in equation ( 1 ) , we compute the integral over frequency at many values of the optical depth and obtain a fit to this function . the integral over solid angle",
    "is reduced to one dimension in the spherical case , and is performed at each radius .",
    "we initiate @xmath44 by assuming the system to be optically thin . at each iteration",
    ", @xmath47 is recomputed for each radius and polar angle , and new values of @xmath53 are found .",
    "this iteration is repeated until @xmath53 has converged with a fractional error less than @xmath54 .",
    "the neutral fraction profile as a function of radius , in @xmath55 , is shown in the left panel of figure 1 for the four halo masses .",
    "as expected , the ionizing photons penetrate deeper in halos of lower mass . for a power - law density profile",
    ", self - similarity implies that the shape of the @xmath53 profile depends on the gas density and the background intensity only through one parameter , @xmath2 , which is the neutral fraction at the radius @xmath56 where the cloud becomes self - shielding : @xmath57 . here",
    ", @xmath56 is defined as the impact parameter where the column density is @xmath58 with both @xmath59 and @xmath60 computed without including the self - shielding correction . using the approximation @xmath61 and ignoring also any external cutoff in the isothermal gas density profile , one finds @xmath62^{1/2 } ~.\\ ] ] thus , the shape of the neutral fraction profile depends only on the product @xmath63 .",
    "it is easily shown that the self - shielding radius @xmath56 is proportional to @xmath64 .",
    "for the four halo masses we use , ( @xmath65 and @xmath22 ) , and @xmath35 , we find @xmath66 and @xmath67 , and @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "the right panel of figure 1 shows the neutral fraction profiles for these four cases as a function of @xmath70 .",
    "this general shape of the neutral fraction profiles of self - shielding clouds ionized by the cosmic background can be simply understood as follows : the cloud becomes self - shielding at the radius where the total rate of recombinations balances the rate at which photons come into the cloud .",
    "therefore , once a radius @xmath71 is reached where most photons with frequency near @xmath33 have been absorbed , the cloud becomes mostly neutral over a small range in radius , because the rate of recombinations required to balance the absorption of all the higher frequency photons is not much higher .",
    "the effect has been demonstrated before by @xcite and @xcite , and is analogous to the sharp edges of disks produced by self - shielding @xcite . since @xmath72",
    ", we conclude that for @xmath73 , some of the highest frequency photons will penetrate into the atomic region of the cloud ( causing a residual ionization inside the atomic region ) , while for @xmath74 , all the photons have mean free paths small compared to @xmath56 once the cloud is mostly atomic , so the intensity of ionizing photons suddenly drops to zero and there is a sharp transition to a completely atomic gas .",
    "figure 2 shows the predicted distribution of column densities , @xmath75 , when random lines of sight intersect the four model gas clouds ( obtained by requiring @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is found by integrating the hydrogen density times the neutral fraction in fig . 1 over lines of sight at impact parameter @xmath45 ) .",
    "the transition to atomic gas causes a feature in the distribution , with a hump appearing at column density @xmath78 .",
    "superposed on our curves , we reproduce a recent compilation of the column density distribution of known damped ly@xmath0 systems , from @xcite .",
    "the points seem to fit best the curve for the @xmath79 halo ( notice that the points can be arbitrarily shifted vertically ) .",
    "in particular , the point at the lowest column density suggests a shallower slope of the distribution . this is a marginal indication that the feature predicted by the self - shielding effect may have been detected .",
    "if so , the value of @xmath2 that is inferred is @xmath80 , which for our adopted value of the photoionization rate @xmath81 , corresponds to @xmath82 .",
    "we caution , however , that the predicted shape depends on the assumed total gas density profile , which we have taken to be singular isothermal .",
    "we have shown that self - shielding should cause a sharp transition from an ionized to an atomic medium in any gas cloud photoionized by the external cosmic background .",
    "the expected absence of photons above frequency @xmath34 due to absorption makes that transition even sharper once the neutral fraction has been increased by a factor 64 by self - shielding .",
    "this produces a hump in the column density distribution .",
    "the column density at which the hump occurs measures the quantity @xmath63 .",
    "most damped ly@xmath0 systems are likely to be photoionized by the external cosmic background .",
    "in fact , since their rate of occurrence is about one fourth per unit redshift at @xmath83 @xcite , and the mean free path of ionizing photons is @xmath84 @xcite , it is easily shown that if all the sources of the cosmic ionizing background were embedded inside damped ly@xmath0 systems , then the local source in any such system would contribute about the same flux as the external background on average .",
    "it is much more likely that any sources associated with typical damped ly@xmath0 systems do not contribute significantly to the cosmic background .",
    "the results for the column density distribution presented by @xcite suggest a possible detection of the self - shielding effect , which would imply a radius @xmath82 for @xmath35 .",
    "this represents a measurement of the size of the clumps in damped ly@xmath0 systems . even though our calculation is for a spherical , isolated cloud",
    ", a system of randomly located clumps would produce a similar column density distribution depending on the radius of the clumps , as long as each clump is illuminated by the ionizing background with an optical depth @xmath85 along a large fraction of directions .",
    "this should be correct since the typical number of intersected clumps identified in the metal absorption lines is not very large .",
    "the typical size of damped ly@xmath0 systems inferred from cdm models where all halos with @xmath86 give rise to the absorption systems is 1 to 10 @xmath55 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "hydrodynamic cosmological simulations show that , at redshift @xmath87 , for halos more massive than @xmath88 , the projected distance of dlas to the center of the nearest galaxy is around @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "since the clump size we infer is about the same , this suggests that the multiple metal absorption lines do not arise from highly overdense clumps , but from mild density fluctuations in gaseous halos .",
    "if there were highly overdense clumps , their small self - shielding radii would produce a column density distribution with a less pronounced hump at lower column density than the curves in figure 2 .",
    "the appearance of individual absorption lines in the spectra of and other metal lines might be deceiving , and could be due to a continuous medium , where the density is highly sensitive to the gas density due to photoionization and self - shielding effects .",
    "nevertheless , a number of caveats must be borne in mind in interpreting the observed column density distribution as a measurement of @xmath63 . in reality , there should be a distribution of clump sizes , and differences from a simple spherical geometry would introduce additional variations , which would smooth the shape of the distribution predicted in figure 2 . furthermore , the density profile of the gas cloud can be different from what we assume here",
    ". a fully three - dimensional calculation of self - shielding in a hydrodynamic simulation of galaxy formation would be highly desirable for a more robust interpretation of the observations of damped ly@xmath0 systems .",
    "finally , we mention that once the size of the clumps is known , their column densities can be used to infer their gas mass , and the temperature required to have a cloud in hydrostatic equilibrium ( see @xcite ) . using a typical column density @xmath90 for a clump , and a radius @xmath82 , a gas mass of @xmath91 is inferred for the self - shielded region . in the absence of dark matter ,",
    "the temperature in hydrostatic equilibrium is @xmath92k . since this is near the expected temperature in photoionization equilibrium",
    ", this would imply that the gas clumps in damped systems do not contain a lot of dark matter .",
    "however , this conclusion is altered if the gas temperature is higher due to shock heating or turbulent motions are important ."
