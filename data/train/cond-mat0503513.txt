    "relativistic quantum mechanics has predicted a rapid oscillatory behavior of free electrons , called _ zitterbewegung _ , which is due to the interference between the positive- and negative - energy components in the wave packet.@xcite this peculiar oscillation happens because the velocity is not a constant of motion even in the absence of any potential and has a fluctuating component , while the momentum commutes with the hamiltonian .",
    "recently , from the analogy between the band structure of semiconductor quantum wells and relativistic electrons in vacuum , it has been pointed out that electrons in semiconductors undergo the same oscillatory motion.@xcite the essential mechanism causing such a motion is the spin - orbit ( so ) coupling in the semiconductor . in a two - dimensional electron gas confined in a heterostructure quantum well ,",

    "the velocity of the electron is not a constant of motion : @xmath6 the spin precession @xmath7 due to the so coupling eventually leads to a fluctuating velocity and consequently an oscillating motion of the electron .    while the oscillatory behavior of the electron is dynamic in the original proposal of the zitterbewegung , it is highly plausible that one can observe _ static _ patterns of charge density oscillation in some properly - structured semiconductor samples .    in our paper",
    "we investigate static charge and spin density oscillations along a ferromagnet / semiconductor single junction quantum wire in the ballistic limit .",
    "the charge and spin densities across the system are calculated using coherent scattering theory .",
    "the observed oscillatory behaviors are explained in terms of the symmetric or antisymmetric structure of charge and spin distributions of eigenstates in the semiconductor quantum wire .",

    "the oscillation amplitude is given by the distance between the center line @xmath140 and the points where the density reaches its maximum .",
    "the parabolic dependence of @xmath139 on @xmath2 at small so couplings indicates that the charge density oscillation is a second - order effect of the so coupling .",

    "our observation is related to the prediction of schliemann and loss@xcite about the oscillatory behavior of free electrons in the presence of rashba so coupling : the center of an electron wave packet oscillates in the direction perpendicular to its group velocity @xmath142 with the frequency @xmath143 , giving rise to the oscillation period @xmath144 along the propagating direction .",
    "controlled steady injection of wave packets with the same @xmath142 can produce the static density modulations we have observed .",
    "they also studied the dynamic oscillation of an electron with a given momentum @xmath20 in quantum wires , where the electron is prepared initially in the lowest - lying spin - polarized states . in this case , since the initial state is not an energy eigenstate , dynamic beating patterns due to the interference of waves with different energies are observed . on the other hand ,",
    "our static density oscillation patterns are due to the interference of the energy eigenstates with a given energy .",

    "we now include the effect of the dresselhaus so coupling on the charge density modulation .",
    "the unitary relation between two so terms @xmath4 and @xmath5 discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : qw ] guarantees that the dresselhaus so coupling results in exactly the same charge density oscillation as the rashba so coupling . in the presence of both coupling terms",
    ", however , the oscillation vanishes as the strengths of two terms become equal to each other .",
    "figure  [ fig : dresselhausamp ] shows that the amplitude of the oscillation decreases with @xmath146 for finite @xmath2 and the oscillation disappears when @xmath96 .",
    "this tendency is quite similar to the dependence of the antisymmetric distribution of @xmath95 on the so coupling .",
    "it also supports the close relation between the charge density oscillation and the antisymmetric structure of eigenstates in semiconductor quantum wires .    before closing this section",
    "we address the experimental observability of the charge density modulations .",
    "since the oscillation patterns depend on the energy of the incident electron , it should be checked whether the superposition of charge density patterns from different energies can weaken the overall density oscillation .",
    "figure  [ fig : periodamp](a ) shows that for large so coupling @xmath147 the period strongly depends on the energy .",
    "therefore , in the case of a large voltage drop across the junction the injection of electrons with a wide range of energy will smear the density modulation by superposing density patterns oscillating with different periods . for small so coupling , on the other hand ,",
    "the phase as well as the oscillation period pattern are weakly dependent on the energy , leading to the superposition of commensurate density patterns .",
    "in addition , the states below the fermi level are irrelevant to the charge density oscillation because the levels are filled incoherently such that their charge distributions are always symmetric with respect to @xmath43 .",
    "hence the condition for the observation of charge density oscillation is that either the so coupling strength or the applied voltage across the junction should be small enough . under this condition ,",
    "charge oscillations can be detected via high - resolution scanning probe microscopy techniques@xcite by imaging the charge density directly or by measuring the change of conductance along the quantum wire as a function of the position of a tip that can deplete charges under it.@xcite      in the presence of so coupling the electron spin precesses in the effective magnetic field that depends on the momentum .",
    "spin density patterns thus reflect such spin precession as well as the charge density distribution discussed in the previous section .",
    "figure  [ fig : spinoscr ] shows spin density profiles along the quantum wire if only rashba so coupling is present .",
    "the spin precessing patterns in @xmath148 indicate that the effective magnetic field is approximately perpendicular to the electron s moving direction .",
    "the spin distribution @xmath148 is not symmetric with respect to @xmath43 in the semiconductor region and this behavior gets stronger as the so coupling increases .",
    "it is because the spin pattern follows the charge density oscillation that is also asymmetric . while @xmath149 for all @xmath9 , @xmath150 is nonvanishing inside the semiconductor , increasing in magnitude with the so coupling strength . unlike @xmath148 ,",
    "@xmath150 get biased to positive values as @xmath2 is increased , indicating a spin polarization along the @xmath12-direction .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the spin polarization of the lowest modes at large @xmath20 and @xmath2 ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : eigenstate ] ) .",
    "the dresselhaus so coupling also gives rise to similar spin profiles ; the spin axes @xmath23 and @xmath12 are exchanged , and the spin distributions are mirror - reflected with respect to @xmath43 . in the presence of both coupling effects , on the other hand , the spin density patterns , with all the components nonvanishing , become distorted as shown in fig .",
