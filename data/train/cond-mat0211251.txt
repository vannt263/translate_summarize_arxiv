    "mesoscopic hybrid structures composed of superconducting ( s ) and normal ( n ) metals demonstrate a reach variety of intriguing physical phenomena .",
    "many of them have recently been extensively investigated  both experimentally and theoretically  and received adequate interpretation within the framework of the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "for a recent review .",
    "one of the remaining puzzles in the field concerns the paramagnetic reentrance phenomenon observed in silver - niobium @xcite and gold - niobium @xcite proximity cylinders in the limit of very low temperatures .",
    "this reentrance behavior is in a clear contradiction with earlier theoretical predictions @xcite as well as with the results of more recent studies @xcite demonstrating that diamagnetism in sn proximity cylinders should progress _ monotonously _ with decreasing temperature .",
    "several theoretical explanations of this reentrance phenomenon have been put forward @xcite . however",
    ", a detailed comparison with experiments carried out in refs . indicates that none of these explanations is able to correctly reproduce the absolute value or the temperature dependence of the observed paramagnetic reentrance effect .",
    "one of the explanations has also been subject to theoretical debate @xcite .",
    "it is important to emphasize that , while the authors @xcite invoke additional assumptions about the form of electron - electron interactions in the n - metal , the work @xcite operates with the standard model for sn proximity systems which assumes no interaction between electrons in the normal layer .",
    "this model is usually very well described by means of the standard approach based on the quasiclassical eilenberger equations . in order to test the conjecture @xcite , that paramagnetic reentrance could be missing within the standard quasiclassical formalism because of an additional contribution from the low energy `` glancing '' states , one needs to go beyond quasiclassics and analyze the problem within a more general approach . below we will use the microscopic gorkov equations and evaluate the screening current by constructing the full green functions for the problem in question .",
    "we will then compare our result with that derived from the eilenberger equations .",
    "this comparison confirms the applicability of the standard quasiclassical technique and demonstrates that no paramagnetic reentrance can occur in sn proximity cylinders in the absence of electron - electron interactions in the n - layer .",
    "another interesting property of the same structures is the so - called magnetic breakdown of proximity - induced meissner screening .",
    "this effect occurs at a certain value of the external magnetic field @xmath1 , above which the diamagnetic expulsion of the field from the normal layer turns out to be energetically unfavorable @xcite although the proximity effect itself is not yet suppressed . in the absence of impurities in the n - layer and for the case of a perfectly transparent interface between s- and n - metals the breakdown field @xmath2",
    "was evaluated in ref . .",
    "since at sufficiently low temperatures the _ linear _ current response of sn proximity cylinders does not depend on the transmission of the sn interface @xcite one could assume that at @xmath3 the result @xcite for @xmath1 should also apply at arbitrary transmissions .",
    "however , this turns out not to be the case .",
    "as we will show below , the breakdown field scales linearly with the interface transmission and , hence , @xmath1 should be strongly suppressed in the limit of small transmissions .",
    "this effect makes it possible to extract information about the interface transmission from the measurements of the magnetic breakdown field @xmath1 .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section ii we will present a general derivation of the non - linear screening current in superconductor - normal metal proximity systems with arbitrary interface transmissions .",
    "this derivation is carried out on the basis of the microscopic gorkov equations and does not involve energy - integrated quasiclassical eilenberger functions .",
    "the effect of magnetic breakdown of proximity - induced screening is analyzed in section iii .",
    "applicability of the quasiclassical approach for the problem in question is discussed in section iv .",
    "we will consider a clean sin structure and assume it to be uniform along the directions parallel to the interfaces ( coordinates @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) .",
    "the normal metallic layer ( n ) and the bulk superconductor ( s ) are located respectively at @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "our analysis will be based on the gorkov equations of the microscopic theory of superconductivity @xcite .",
    "after the fourier transformation of the normal ( @xmath8 ) and anomalous ( @xmath9 ) green functions with respect to @xmath4 and @xmath5 , @xmath10 the gorkov equations take the following standard form @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the matsubara frequency , and @xmath13 is the superconducting order parameter . below we will choose @xmath14 for @xmath7 and @xmath15 otherwise . the hamiltonian @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( [ start ] ) is defined as @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 is fermi energy and the term @xmath20 accounts for the boundary potentials .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath21 is obtained from @xmath16 ( [ h ] ) by inverting the sign of the electron charge @xmath22 .",
    "in what follows we shall neglect the square term @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) .",
    "this approximation applies in the range of magnetic fields @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the fermi momentum and @xmath26 is the superconducting flux quantum .",
    "we will assume that the london penetration depth of the bulk superconductor is small and neglect the magnetic field inside the superconductor .",
    "the latter assumption allows to set @xmath27 .",
    "the next standard step is to decompose the green functions into the product of quickly oscillating terms @xmath28 and the two component envelope functions @xmath29 changing at scales much longer than the fermi wavelength .",
    "one has @xmath30 where we defined @xmath31 and @xmath32 a convenient choice of the gauge for the problem in question is @xmath33 .",
    "below we will make use of this gauge and proceed along the lines with our previous analysis @xcite .",
    "let us fix the coordinate @xmath34 within the normal metal . in this case for @xmath7",
    "the general solution of eq . ( [ start ] ) can be written in the form @xmath35 here we restricted ourselves to small matsubara frequencies @xmath36 .",
    "this is sufficient in the most interesting physical limit @xmath37 and @xmath38 which we only consider below .    the general solution of eq .",
    "( [ start ] ) for @xmath39 reads @xmath40 here the functions @xmath41 obey the equations @xmath42 and the first term in the right hand side of ( [ rs ] ) with @xmath43 represents the particular solution of eq .",

    "what remains is to determine six functions @xmath44 and @xmath45 in eqs .",
    "( [ ls],[rs ] ) .",
    "this is done with the aid of the boundary conditions imposed on both sides of the normal layer .",
    "first we consider the sn interface .",
    "matching the wave functions on both sides of this interface , respectively @xmath46 and @xmath47 , is performed in a standard manner ( see , e.g. , ref . ): @xmath48 where the reflection and transmission coefficients are equal to @xmath49 applying eqs .",
    "( [ scatt ] ) to the two - component vectors @xmath50 we get four linear equations for six unknown functions in eqs .",
    "( [ ls],[rs ] ) .",
    "the remaining two equations are derived at the interface between vacuum and the normal metal ( @xmath51 ) where we assume complete specular reflection of the electrons .",
    "this boundary condition trivially yields @xmath52 the above six linear equations uniquely define the green function of our system .",
    "technically the calculation is similar to that presented in ref .",
    ", therefore we will not go into further details here .",

    "it reads @xmath54 note , that the terms @xmath55 and @xmath56 in eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) are quickly oscillating functions of @xmath57 .",
    "integration over the momentum directions in ( [ real ] ) is equivalent @xcite to averaging over the angle @xmath58 . performing this averaging we arrive at a spatially homogeneous screening current in the n - layer @xmath59 the function @xmath8 in eq .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) depends on the complex variable @xmath60 , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 the function @xmath63 is @xmath64-periodic in @xmath65 .",
    "within one period it is defined on a strip @xmath66 with the cut going from @xmath67 to @xmath68 . for such values of @xmath65 one",

    "it is easy to check that our result reduces to the already known ones in the corresponding limits .",
    "for instance , in the case of a perfectly transmitting sn interface ( @xmath72 ) eqs .",
    "( [ f1])-([f2 ] ) reproduce the non - linear response derived in ref . .",
    "another important limit is that of a small external field . in this case",
    "one can linearize the function @xmath8 ( [ f2 ] ) in @xmath73 and find @xmath74^{3/2 } } , \\label{japan}\\ ] ] this result was obtained in ref . with the aid of a different approach .",
    "it is interesting that at low temperatures @xmath75 the transmission and reflection coefficients drop out and for any nonzero @xmath76 the result ( [ japan ] ) reduces to a simple formula @xmath77 which was initially derived @xcite for @xmath78 . at higher temperatures",
    "@xmath76 does not anymore drop out of the final result .",
    "for instance , in the limit @xmath79 we obtain @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the value of @xmath82 at @xmath83 . in the case of low transmissions @xmath84",
    "there exists an additional temperature interval @xmath85 , where the current shows a power - law dependence on temperature : @xmath86    it is important to emphasize that the screening current in the n - metal is _ uniform _ in space and , hence , is a nonlocal function of the vector potential .",
    "combining this result with the maxwell equations one easily arrives at the self - consistency condition for the `` phase '' @xmath73 @xmath87 in the linear response regime the current density @xmath88 can be expressed in the form @xmath89 .",
    "as soon as the effective length @xmath90 becomes small , @xmath91 , the non - locality of the screening current turns out to be important . for instance , at @xmath3 we have @xmath92 , the magnetic field penetrating into the normal layer becomes over - screened @xcite , @xmath93 , and the average magnetization of the n - layer reads @xmath94 .",
    "the above meissner state of our hybrid structure is thermodynamically favorable only in relatively small magnetic fields . at higher values of @xmath71",
    "the diamagnetic screening current gets suppressed and the magnetic field can freely penetrate into the n - layer .",
    "this magnetic breakdown effect was experimentally studied by mota and coworkers @xcite and was also addressed theoretically @xcite in the case of perfectly transparent sn interfaces . in this section",
    "we will consider the magnetic breakdown of the meissner effect in clean proximity structures with an arbitrary transmission of the sn interface .",
    "we will closely follow the strategy adopted in ref . .",
    "the free energy @xmath95 of the current state ( normalized per unit surface ) can be recovered by means of the standard procedure which amounts to integrating the current ( [ f1 ] ) over an effective `` coupling constant '' @xmath96 @xmath97 in the presence of an external magnetic field we have to minimize the gibbs free energy @xmath98 in the limit of low external fields @xmath99 the diamagnetic solution described in the previous section is the only possible one . on the contrary , at high magnetic fields @xmath100 this solution can not be realized . in this case",
    "another solution of the maxwell equations  which describes full penetration of the magnetic field into the n - layer  takes over . in the intermediate regime",
    "@xmath101 the diamagnetic and non - magnetic solutions may coexist .",
    "the first order phase transition between these two states occurs in this intermediate regime at a certain value of the magnetic field @xmath102 implying the magnetic breakdown of meissner screening . since this breakdown field @xmath1",
    "can be sufficiently large , the full nonlinear expression for the diamagnetic response , eqs .",
    "( [ f1])-([f2 ] ) , should be taken into account .",
    "first let us briefly consider the case of a perfectly transparent sn interface @xmath103 and re - derive the results @xcite .",

    "it was found in both papers that for comparatively clean samples the temperature dependence of the breakdown field is quite well described by a theory derived in the clean limit . at the same time the amplitude of @xmath1 turned out to be somewhat smaller ( typically by a factor @xmath163 ) than that predicted in the ballistic case .",
    "one can attribute this discrepancy to the effect of electron scattering on non - magnetic impurities in the n - layer @xcite .",
    "it follows from the above analysis that another possible reason for this suppression of @xmath1 is a non - perfect transmission of the sn interface .    for instance",
    ", one can argue that the difference between theory ( [ lt ] ) and experiment by a factor @xmath164 found in ref . at low @xmath165",
    "could be due to the effect of the interface transmission . then from fig . 2",
    "one would recover @xmath166 . in the most relevant case of a thin effective potential barrier at the sn interface",
    "the angle - dependent transmission is defined as @xmath167 in which case the above estimate for @xmath81 will translate into the value of the minimum interface reflectivity @xmath168 .",
    "hence , one can conclude that sn interfaces in the experiments @xcite were indeed highly transmittive as it was already assumed before by a number of authors .",
    "of course , other factors , such as electron scattering on impurities in the n - layer , differences in geometry and corrections due to the term @xmath169 neglected in eq .",
    "( [ si ] ) , can cause additional minor discrepancies @xcite between theoretical and experimental values of @xmath1 and can slightly modify our estimate for @xmath170 .",
    "however , the above conclusion can hardly be affected by these minor modifications .",
    "in fact , the estimate for @xmath170 could only increase if electron scattering on impurities is taken into account in addition to the effect discussed here .",
    "finally let us briefly address the applicability of the quasiclassical eilenberger approach for the problem in question . solving the eilenberger equations in the s- and n - metals and matching these solutions at the sn interface with the aid of the zaitsev boundary conditions we have evaluated the screening current in the n - layer of our proximity system .",
    "the calculation is to much extent analogous to that presented in appendix a of ref .",
    ", therefore we will not go into details here .",
    "although the result of this calculation does not exactly match with our general expression ( [ real ] ) , it turns out to be _ identical _ to one presented by eqs .",
    "( [ f1])-([f2 ] ) .",
    "the latter result was obtained from ( [ real ] ) by means of averaging over all possible directions of the fermi momentum or , equivalently , over the angle @xmath58 . similarly to ref .",
    "the difference between the expressions for the current before and after this averaging is small in the parameter @xmath171 .",
    "we also note that in the case of highly transmitting interfaces , @xmath172 , no averaging over @xmath58 is needed and eq .",
    "( [ real ] ) coincides exactly with the result of the quasiclassical analysis @xcite .",

    "the screening current acquire a small correction .",

    "both these parameters are very small since they contain the ratio between the fermi wavelength and at least one of the system dimensions .",
    "for instance , for the systems studied in refs .",
    "we estimate @xcite @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
    "hence , one can conclude that the eilenberger formalism remains very accurate in this case and no significant physics is missing within this formalism at any temperature and at any interface transmission .",
    "the above estimates also indicate that within our model no paramagnetic reentrance effect can be expected in sn proximity cylinders . indeed in the limit @xmath182",
    "the difference between the slab and cylinder geometries is negligible and our results will be directly applicable to the latter geometry if we identify @xmath173 with the circumference of the cylinder .",
    "then the correction from all electron states within the energy interval @xmath183 from the fermi energy ( obviously this correction also includes the contribution of the low energy glancing states @xcite ) is small as @xmath184 .",
    "although the conclusion about the absence of paramagnetic reentrance was obtained here only in the clean limit and for specularly reflecting interfaces , this conclusion should apply in the presence of impurities as well .",
    "in fact , a purely ballistic situation appears to be most favorable for the low energy glancing states .",
    "as soon as a finite electron mean free path @xmath185 is introduced a proximity induced minigap @xmath186 will develop in the normal metal @xcite and there will be no glancing states in the system at all .",
    "we also note that our present consideration does not include the contribution of the electron states with energies smaller than @xmath187 .",
    "this contribution to the current ( which has nothing to do with superconductivity and glancing states ) can be roughly estimated with the aid of the standard results for the persistent currents in normal metallic cylinders , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "making use of these results , in the limit of small magnetic fields one can assume @xmath188 .",
    "the relative magnitude of this contribution is also much smaller than the proximity induced diamagnetic current studied here . at @xmath3 and for relatively high interface transmissions",
    "one finds @xmath189^{1/2}$ ] . for typical experimental parameters @xcite this ratio is of order @xmath190 , i.e. in this case no noticeable correction to our results could be expected either .",
    "in summary , with the aid of the microscopic gorkov equations we have derived a general expression for the non - linear diamagnetic current in a clean superconductor - insulator - normal metal structure with an arbitrary interface transmission .",
    "we have demonstrated that at low temperatures the magnetic breakdown field @xmath1 is suppressed linearly with the transmission of the insulating barrier .",
    "this observation enables one to obtain information about the quality of inter - metallic interfaces from measurements of @xmath1 .",
    "we have also compared our results with those derived within the quasiclassical eilenberger approach and found the latter approach to be extremely accurate for the systems under consideration at all relevant temperatures down to @xmath0 and at any interface transmission .",

    "<S> we derive a general microscopic expression for the non - linear diamagnetic current in a clean superconductor - insulator - normal metal structure with an arbitrary interface transmission . in the absence of electron - electron interactions in the normal metal the diamagnetic response increases monotonously with decreasing temperature showing no sign of paramagnetic reentrance down to @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we also analyze the magnetic breakdown of proximity - induced meissner screening . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the magnetic breakdown field should be strongly suppressed in the limit of small interface transmissions while the linear diamagnetic current does not depend on the transmission of the insulating barrier at low enough temperatures . </S>"
