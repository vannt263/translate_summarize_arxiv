    "progress in material technology , especially in nanofabrication , ultrathin film manufacturing , ultraclean and high vacuum systems , _ etc . , _ requires better understanding of boundary scattering in physical processes .",
    "the boundary effects should be an integral part of any study of quantum wires , wells , and films .",
    "boundary scattering is especially important for transport in ultrathin and/or clean systems in which the particle mean free path is comparable to the system size .",
    "below we consider the effect of random surface roughness on quantum transport in quantized quasi-@xmath5 systems such as , for example , ultrathin metal films .",
    "the main issue is to find how sensitive is the transport along such film to the statistical properties of random surface inhomogeneities ( thickness fluctuations ) .",
    "an important by - product of our systematic comparison of different classes of random surface inhomogeneities is the prediction of a new type of size effect in quantized films .",
    "this effect manifests itself as large oscillations of conductivity @xmath0 as a function of the film thickness @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast to the usual quantum size effect ( qse ) , the peaks can be observed only at relatively large values of @xmath6 .",
    "the distance between the peaks is large and is roughly proportional to @xmath7 .",
    "the observation of this qse opens a new experimental method of identification of the type of surface roughness .",
    "the choice of quasi-@xmath5 systems is explained by a desire to avoid divergence of surface fluctuations and strong localization effects which are inherent to @xmath8 systems and make a systematic quantitative study of the effect of surface inhomogeneities on transport virtually impossible . in contrast to @xmath8 systems , the randomly fluctuating @xmath5 surfaces are practically stable while the localization length in systems with weak surface roughness is exponentially large .",
    "( in general , the _ transport _ problems are more interesting in systems with weak rather than with strong roughness .",
    "transport in systems with strong roughness is trivial : each wall collision completely dephases the particles and the mean free path can not exceed the distance between the walls ) .",
    "the prevalent way to characterize the random surface roughness and/or thickness fluctuations is to use the correlation function of surface inhomogeneities @xmath9 where the vector @xmath10 gives the @xmath5 coordinates along the surface , @xmath11  describes the deviation of the position of the surface in the point with @xmath5 coordinates @xmath10 from its average position , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the averaging area . here it is  assumed that the correlation properties of the surface do not depend on direction",
    ". two main characteristics of the surface correlation functions @xmath14 are the average amplitude (  height  ) @xmath15 and correlation radius (  size  ) @xmath2 of surface inhomogeneities .",
    "any transport theory for systems with rough boundaries should provide the explicit dependence of the particle mean free path ( or the conductivity along the walls ) on the correlator of surface inhomogeneities @xmath16 . without bulk scattering ,",
    "the conductivity @xmath0  is determined by the relation between three length scales : particle wavelength , @xmath17 ; the width of the channel , @xmath1 ; and the correlation radius of inhomogeneities , @xmath2 .",
    "if the roughness is weak , the fourth length parameter , @xmath15 , enters conductivity as a coefficient , @xmath18 note , that this @xmath5 conductivity differs by a length unit from the usual @xmath19 conductivity and , as a result , has a dimensionality of conductance .",
    "the form of the surface correlator @xmath20 can vary from surface to surface .",
    "most of the theoretical calculations assume that this correlator is gaussian .",
    "the numerical simulations , on the other hand , often rely on various generators for random rough surfaces without paying much attention to the correlation function of the generated inhomogeneities .",
    "both approaches are not satisfactory since the experiments on surface scattering and diffraction patterns show that real surfaces exhibit surface correlators @xmath21 of various forms@xcite .",
    "even one and the same film can exhibit various correlation properties on different stages of growth . as a result ,",
    "the behavior of the functions @xmath22 in eq .",
    "@xmath23 , which reflects the correlation properties of inhomogeneities , can vary from surface to surface even when the main correlation parameters @xmath15 and @xmath2 remain the same .",
    "the correlation functions @xmath21 are characterized by different long - range behavior that can be reliably identified in various surface diffraction and scattering experiments .",
    "what we would like to know is how sensitive is the _ particle _ _ transport _ to the form of the surface correlator .",
    "in contrast to surface diffraction and scattering data with angular and/or wavelength scanning , the transport coefficients are integral parameters that include angular and wavelength averaging .",
    "this leaves the question of how sensitive is the conductivity to the shape of the surface correlator wide open .",
    "in addition , we are asking a question whether it is possible to identify the type of surface inhomogeneities from transport experiments in ultrathin films or multilayer systems without beforehand information on the form of the surface correlator .",
    "the interrelated question is , of course , to what extent one should pay attention to the details of the correlator of surface inhomogeneities in analytical or numerical transport calculations for particles with large mean free paths .",
    "the former issue has already been raised in refs.@xcite for a small set of surface correlators on the basis of the born approximation for wall scattering .",
    "below we present a systematic study which is based on a more general transport formalism and involves a variety of classes of surface correlators .",
    "in short , we want to compare functions @xmath24 in eq.@xmath25 calculated for various types of the correlation functions @xmath20 in a wide range of parameters .",
    "we start from degenerate ballistic fermions in quantized metal films .",
    "the choice is not arbitrary : transport in such systems involves the minimal degree of averaging ( integration ) and can be the most sensitive to the long - range properties of the surface correlators @xmath26 .",
    "quantum size effect ( qse ) in metal films is a subject of intensive experimental study .",
    "recent qse experiments with quantized metal films include conductivity @xcite , spectroscopy @xcite , susceptibility @xcite , and stm @xcite measurements .",
    "one of the signature features of qse in metals is a pronounced saw - like dependence of conductivity on , for example , film thickness , @xmath27 .",
    "this dependence was predicted for both bulk @xcite and surface @xcite scattering .",
    "experimentally , qse in conductivity was studied for metals in refs.@xcite ( for earlier results see references therein ) .",
    "however , experiments on qse in metals have to overcome a difficulty which one does not encounter in semiconductors .",
    "the period of the qse oscillations in the dependence @xmath27 is usually small , almost atomic , @xmath28 ( below , except for final results , @xmath29 ) . for this reason",
    "typical experimental object are lead or semimetal films such as bismuth .",
    "below we predict a new type of qse with large - period oscillations of @xmath30 at relatively large values of @xmath31 that could lead to observation of qse in a wider group of metals .",
    "large - period qse oscillations have already been observed ( see the second ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; however , sketchy experimental details do not allow one to identify reliably this observation as the new type of qse predicted below .",
    "our results can also resolve the long - standing controversy on the influence of the structure of the nanoscale film on its resistivity @xcite .",
    "recently , we developed a transparent semi - analytical formalism for transport in systems with rough boundaries that allows simple uniform calculations in a wide range of parameters and for various types of roughness with and without bulk scattering @xcite .",
    "this formalism unites approaches by tesanovic _",

    "et al_@xcite ( for a brief comparison between different theoretical approaches see refs.@xcite ) .",
    "below we apply this formalism with an explicit purpose of studying the dependence of the transport coefficients on the shape of the correlation function of surface inhomogeneities .",
    "the well - defined limits of applicability of our approach to metal and semiconductor films are discussed in detail in refs.@xcite .    since the @xmath5 mobility of particles is described by essentially the same equations as the exponent in the expression for the localization length in films , our study provides the dependence of the localization length on the type of the correlation function of random surface inhomogeneities .",
    "the paper has the following structure . in the next section",
    "we introduce various types of surface correlation functions .",
    "section iii briefly describes the transport equation used for conductivity ( mobility ) calculations in qse conditions .",
    "the results of transport calculations for different types of correlators are given in section iv .",
    "conclusions and experimental implications are discussed in section v. appendix a contains useful analytical expressions for the power density spectral functions of inhomogeneities responsible for the behavior of scattering probabilities for different types of correlators .",
    "appendix b deals with the positions of new type of qse peaks .",
    "we consider an infinite @xmath5 channel ( or film ) of the average thickness @xmath1 with random rough boundaries @xmath32 ( the walls are assumed hard with infinite potential ) .",
    "the inhomogeneities are small , @xmath33 , and random with zero average , @xmath34 .",
    "their correlation function @xmath35 and its fourier image @xmath36 , which is often called the power spectral density function or power spectrum , are defined as @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the @xmath5 vectors . in homogeneous systems ,",
    "the correlation function depends only on the distance between points @xmath40 and not on coordinates themselves .",
    "the correlation functions @xmath41 and @xmath42 describe intrawall correlations of inhomogeneities , and @xmath43 are the interwall correlations . usually , but not always , the inhomogeneities on different walls are not correlated with each other , @xmath44 .",
    "thus , everywhere , except for section i ve , it is assumed that @xmath44 . to avoid parameter clutter",
    ", we also assume that the correlation parameters are the same on both walls , @xmath45 .",
    "then the effective correlator contains @xmath46 with @xmath20 given by equations below .",
    "surface inhomogeneities exhibit a variety of types of the correlation functions @xcite . to have a meaningful comparison , we consider the correlation functions that involve only two characteristic parameters , namely , the amplitude ( average height ) @xmath15 and the correlation radius ( average size ) @xmath2 of surface inhomogeneities .",
    "the most commonly used in theoretical applications is the gaussian correlation function , @xmath47 including its limit for small correlation radius @xmath48 , _",
    "i.e. , _ the @xmath49-type correlations , @xmath50    sometimes , a better fit to experimental data on surface scattering is provided by the use of the exponential correlation function @xmath51 or by the even more long - range , power - law correlators @xmath52 with different values of the parameter @xmath53 .",
    "the most commonly used are the staras function with @xmath54 and the correlator with @xmath55 which has the exponential power spectrum @xmath56 , @xmath57    the use of the lorentzian correlator , which differs from the definition @xmath58 at @xmath59 by the factor @xmath53 in the numerator@xmath60 @xmath61 deserves a special comment .",

    "unphysical  .",

    "the issue to what extent the correlators are  physical  and can be reproduced experimentally is irrelevant in our context . for us ,",
    "the fact that the lorentzian correlator is sometimes used in calculations is sufficient enough to consider this correlator in the paper . to deal with the divergency",
    ", one can truncate the lorentzian correlator at large distances ( the common practice is to make a cut - off at the distances about 0.1 of the system length @xcite ) .",
    "another option is to use the generalized power - law correlator @xmath65 with small @xmath53 instead of the lorentzian @xmath66 . in order not to introduce additional parameters",
    ", we use the untruncated equation @xmath62 .",
    "even though the divergence of @xmath67 does not lead to any singularities in transport coefficients , the transport coefficients for lorentzian surfaces ( see below ) often behave qualitatively different from systems with other types of random inhomogeneities , even from the systems @xmath68 with small @xmath53 .",
    "( sometimes , the divergence of the power spectrum @xmath56 is associated with the fractal nature of the surface @xcite ; to what extent our transport formalism can be used for films with fractal surfaces is an open question ) .",
    "the last class of correlation functions covers the power - law correlators in momentum space , @xmath69 the correlators from this group include the lorentzian in momentum space @xmath70 that was observed in ref.@xcite ( see also ref_._@xcite ) and the exponential correlator @xmath71 at @xmath72 .",
    "the constants in all these correlators are chosen in such a way that the value of @xmath73 is the same .",
    "this provides a reasonable basis of comparison for transport coefficients in films with all these different types of random surfaces .",
    "indeed , the scattering cross - section for @xmath64 does not depend on the details of short- and mid - range structure of surface inhomogeneities .",
    "therefore , at fermi momenta @xmath74 ( more precisely , at @xmath75 ) , the transport coefficients should be the same for all random surfaces .",
