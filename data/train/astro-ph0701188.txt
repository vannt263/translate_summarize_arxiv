    "traditionally studies of galaxy evolution for the entire galaxy population have been pursued by looking for variations in the monovariate luminosity function , either for the whole population ( e.g. , cfrs ; @xcite ) , or subdivided by morphological type or colour cuts ( vvds / combo-17 ; @xcite ) .",
    "however the resolution attainable with the hubble space telescope enables one to move beyond this to study multivariate distributions , such as the luminosity - size plane @xcite , and the colour - structure plane @xcite .",
    "these provide significantly more stringent constraints and are also now becoming the focus of numerical simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this article we summarise work under way",

    "kron magnitudes and elliptical aperture half light radii were computed for all these objects .",
    "photometric redshift estimates based on @xmath7 through @xmath8-band aperture - matched magnitudes and global srsic indices for 2172 galaxies in iudf - bright were obtained from the catalogues of @xcite . these redshifts and broadband magnitudes",
    "were used to derive individual galaxy k - corrections ( observed acs @xmath5-band to rest - frame mgc @xmath7-band ) via fitting of sed templates from the library of @xcite .",
    "we also included a flat spectrum model to approximate the k - corrections relevant to the extreme blue galaxies found in this type of deep imaging .",
    "the iudf - bright k - corrections are shown in fig .",
    "[ cameron_fig1 ] ( right ) along with the relevant sed template tracks .",
    "the gap between the reddest and bluest k - corrections becomes exceptionally large towards high redshift ( @xmath98 mag by @xmath10 ) , which means galaxies with these different sed types are observable over vastly different volumes at fixed luminosity .",
    "this is a large potential source of selection bias if it is not accounted for in the subsequent analysis , and is one of the major drawbacks of optical wavelength studies at high redshift .",
    "+ using our k - corrections , the @xcite photometric redshifts and a cosmological model with @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 km s@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 we were able to compute absolute @xmath15-band magnitudes and sizes .",

    "even with this cut , our udf volume - limited samples do not show the colour - log(@xmath2 ) bimodality as clearly as the mgc data .",

    "the mgc local galaxy relation , also subdivided by structural type , is shown in the top panels and subsequently overlaid as contours . in the diffuse galaxy samples * b * , * c * and * d * where the distribution is free of bias , there is evidence of evolution towards higher surface brightnesses at high redshift and perhaps a change of slope in the luminosity - size relation .",
    "the compact galaxy samples are more tightly bound by the selection limits , but appear to show minimal evolution over this redshift range . +",
    "the trends seen in our luminosity - size and colour - log(n ) diagrams suggest that bright , diffuse ( i.e. , disc ) galaxies are still evolving structurally from high to low redshift .",
    "the sense of this evolution is that the brightest disc galaxies are becoming larger towards low redshift .",
    "this is consistent with the picture from inside - out models of galaxy formation such as @xcite who find @xmath925% growth of disk galaxies since @xmath33 .",
    "bright , compact ( i.e. , elliptical galaxies ) , on the other hand , seem to have finished their structural evolution at high redshift , but continue to evolve in colour to low redshifts .",
    "this picture is broadly consistent with the hierarchical clustering scenario in which the brightest elliptical galaxies are assembled at intermediate - high redshift and their stellar populations passively evolve thereafter .",
    "however , it is also compatible with a scenario in which spheroids form early via collapse and disc grow later ( see @xcite ) .",
