    "a strong drop of @xmath155 near @xmath45 will give rise to a `` soft point '' in the equation of state at which the ability of the matter to generate expansion flow is minimal .",
    "since in our analysis the interaction term @xmath67 remains small and changes smoothly with @xmath13 , we expect only weak modifications of the speed of sound around @xmath45 .",

    "( [ spe1 ] ) also in this case ( as in ref .",

    "our result agrees with the calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite in the high temperature region and differs around @xmath45 because of the non - linear behavior of @xmath43 indicating non - perturbative effects .",
    "these results on the speed of sound show that a massive quark - gluon plasma will expand rapidly and that therefore the phase transition should be a fast process without detectable duration effects .",
    "even where the pressure already shows large ( @xmath166 ) deviations from the massless ideal gas law , the speed of sound still deviates by less than 10% from the value @xmath167 . in this way",

    "in this section we investigate some phenomenological consequences of the large effective quark and gluon masses .",
    "9 displays the effective masses in gev for @xmath156 .",
    "all masses behave similarly , since they are connected to each other by the function @xmath43 in the effective coupling constant @xmath32 . just above the critical temperature",
    "the effective masses drop , but then they remain rather constant in the temperature region @xmath168 . the mass values for the case @xmath4 are smaller than for @xmath60 due to the smaller critical temperature @xmath169 mev instead of 260 mev . for @xmath5",
    "they increase again due to the larger contribution from quark loops and the somewhat larger @xmath170 mev .",
    "the gluon masses are large in the cases @xmath171 , of order @xmath172 mev in the temperature region @xmath173 ( solid lines ) . in the same temperature region",
    "the quark masses are of order @xmath174 mev ( dashed lines ) .",
    "large effective masses yield smaller number density at the same energy density .",
    "thus the density of these massive quasi - particles will be smaller than in the massless case .",
    "10 demonstrates this by displaying the density ratio of the massive quasi - particles and the massless ones , @xmath175 ( solid lines for gluons and dotted lines for quarks ) as a function of temperature . at large temperature",
    "the ratio flattens and eventually approaches 1 , but close to the critical temperature the ratio drops very quickly to values much smaller than 1 .",
    "this indicates that the massive quark - gluon plasma is much more dilute than a massless qgp , especially near @xmath45 .",
    "now we compare the abundances of quarks and gluons relative to each other .",
    "( [ infmg ] ) and ( [ infmq ] ) imply that in our model the gluon effective mass is always larger than the quark effective mass by the ratio @xmath176 which even increases with the number of quark flavor @xmath35 .",
    "each gluon degree of freedom will thus be suppressed compared to each quark degree of freedom . after multiplying the corresponding degeneracy factors we can compute the density ratio for gluons @xmath177 which is shown in fig .",
    "11 as a function of @xmath13 .",
    "the horizontal lines show the ratio @xmath178 for the massless qgp .",
    "the deviation caused by the effective mass is clearly seen , and a considerable suppression of the relative gluon number occurs near the phase transition . near @xmath45 , for @xmath4 we have @xmath179 which means that only 25% of the particles are gluons while the remaining 75% are quarks and antiquarks . for @xmath5",
    "the gluon suppression is even stronger and near @xmath45 we find only 10% gluons and 90% quarks and anti - quarks .",
    "these results show that the massive qgp is a dilute system dominated by massive quarks and antiquarks .",
    "gluons are much heavier than quarks and their number densities are suppressed .",
    "these properties indicate that lattice qcd results support the formation of a quark - antiquark dominated plasma state just above the critical temperature , which contains mostly massive quarks and antiquarks .",
    "this system hadronizes quickly .",
    "fast hadronization is also favored by the fact that the effective quark masses are already close to the masses in the `` constituent quark '' picture of hadrons .",
    "clusterization of these massive quarks leads directly to multiquark states with similar masses as those of the finally observed hadrons , allowing for immediate hadron formation without having to wait for further energy transfer .",
    "lattice data in pure su(3 ) gauge theory and new lattice results with @xmath4 and @xmath5 dynamical fermions suggest that beyond the phase transition temperature strong non - perturbative effects dominate the deconfined state . in order to understand this phenomenon and to facilitate the application of lattice results in dynamical descriptions of the evolution of the deconfined phase and its hadronization we analyzed the lattice data in a phenomenological model assuming the appearance of massive quasi - particles , namely massive quarks and massive transverse gluons .",
    "we determined a temperature dependent effective coupling constant @xmath32 , which determines the effective masses , and the interaction term @xmath67 , which summarizes contributions not to be included into the effective masses .",
    "we found that such a quasi - particle picture works very well .",
    "the interaction term @xmath67 remains small and the extracted dynamical mass is consistent with perturbative qcd results at high temperature while it includes non - perturbative contributions at low temperature . in all cases , @xmath156 ,",
    "the obtained characteristics are very similar .",
    "if we determine @xmath32 in the purely gluonic case and extend it in an appropriate way for @xmath180 , we can reproduce approximately the @xmath130 lattice data .",
    "this fact suggest the existence of a universal description of non - perturbative effects in the fermionless and fermionic cases .",
    "our analysis leads to a thermodynamically consistent quasi - particle model for the qgp equation of state which is parametrized via an effective coupling constant @xmath32 through eqs .",
    "( [ gfun1],[gfun2],[kfun ] ) and the zero point @xmath82 of the interaction term @xmath67 .",
    "further lattice data with improved quality over a wider temperature region are needed to fix @xmath32 and @xmath82 more accurately .",
    "the successful reproduction of lattice data by this quasi - particle model indicates the validity of such an approximation .",
    "the consequences of the appearance of these quasi - particles are very interesting : near @xmath45 lattice results indicate the existence of a qcd phase which is dominated by massive quarks and anti - quarks , while the even heavier gluons are suppressed .",
    "this quark - antiquark plasma can be characterized by a relatively large speed of sound which indicates fast dynamical evolution and the lack of long time delays during hadronization .",
    "massive quarks and anti - quarks can form clusters , 2- and 3-body objects , which can be easily associated with the hadronic mass spectra : massive quarks ( @xmath181 mev ) above the critical temperature turn into similarly massive `` constituent quarks '' inside hadrons below @xmath45 in a smooth but rapid hadronization process .",
