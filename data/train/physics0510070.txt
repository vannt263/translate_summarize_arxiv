'' to our knowledge it was never attempted to prove that the electromagnetic field resulting from a solution of maxwell s equations is actually unique , it was just taken for granted .",
    "if there were no unique solution of maxwell s linear system of first order field equations , gauge transformations on ( nonexisting ) potentials would be irrelevant .    in this paper",
    "we start with the usual assumption that unique solutions of maxwell s equations do exist and try to calculate them both with the help of potentials ( sections 2 - 4 ) and directly from the field equations ( section 5 ) . for the electromagnetic field of a moving particle",

    "we show that the standard linard - wiechert fields , which satisfy maxwell s source - free equations , can not be considered as a unique solution of maxwell s inhomogeneous equations .",
    "thus , we infer that the tacit assumption concerning the existence of unique solutions is not justified in general .",
    "the reason for this failure is discussed in section 8 where we come to the conclusion that the mixture of elliptic and hyperbolic equations , as formulated by maxwell , does not permit a physical solution for moving point sources .",

    "we note that neither of the expressions ( 48 ) and ( 49 ) agrees with the fields as calculated in sections 2 and 3 , because the fields derived from the helmholtz ansatz ( 42 ) depend on the second time derivative of the velocity . assuming a constant velocity of the particle one could also show that the integrals ( 48 ) and ( 49 ) actually diverge .",
    "the two types of potential ansatz ( 6 ) and ( 42 ) resulted in different solutions for the fields .",

    "it was shown in section 3 that the integral ( 55 ) diverges .",
    "hence , it does not represent a physical solution for the rotational part of the electric field .",
    "this analysis shows that the inconsistency inherent to maxwell s equations is not an artefact produced by employing a potential ansatz .",
    "it seems to result from the mixture of hyperbolic and elliptic differential equations for the fields , as they were formulated by maxwell . only in lorenz",
    "gauge the elliptic equations are completely removed so that there is seemingly agreement between the solutions of the hyperbolic equations ( 50 ) and ( 51 ) and the hyperbolic potential equations ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) .",
    "the discrepancies encountered in sections 3 - 5 are apparently related to the fact that maxwell s set of equations mixes hyperbolic and elliptic structures so that unique solutions are not possible . in view of this finding it is somewhat surprising that in lorenz gauge the elliptic features seem to be removed altogether so that equations ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) yield the unique solutions ( 18 ) and ( 19 ) , provided the advanced solutions are suppressed on physical grounds",
    ". a closer look at the inhomogeneous wave equation ( 10 ) reveals , however , that the elliptic character is still there , but concealed in the inhomogeneity .",
    "if it is brought out , it turns out that the solution ( 18 ) can not be considered as unique .    in order to see this",
    "we employ a different method of solution than that used in section 2 . due to the linearity of ( 10 ) one may split the potential into two contributions : @xmath95 the wave equation may then be split into a poisson equation : @xmath96 and into another wave equation : @xmath97 where the solution of the elliptic equation ( 57 ) enters as an extended source , but it was erroneously assumed that @xmath98 in ( 58 ) may be neglected . ] adding ( 57 ) and ( 58 ) the wave equation ( 10 ) is recovered .",

    "the integral is very similar to ( 33 ) and we know from the calculation in section 3 that it has no defined limiting value according to ( 40 ) .",
    "similar considerations apply to the inhomogeneous wave equation ( 11 ) , the solution of which may formally be written as : @xmath101 _ { t'=t-{{r } \\over { c}}}{{d^{3}s } \\over { r}}\\ ] ] by applying the same method of splitting the vector potential into two parts .",
    "if result ( 61 ) is substituted into ( 6 ) , the fields would depend on the third derivative of the velocity , which is not the case according to ( 21 ) , so that ( 61 ) is incompatible with ( 19 ) .",
    "we must conclude then that the potentials ( 56 ) and ( 61 ) disagree with the linard - wiechert potentials ( 18 ) and ( 19 ) which turn out not to be a unique solution of the inhomogeneous wave equations ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) , even if the advanced solutions are suppressed . as a matter of fact ,",
    "equations ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) have no physical solution judged from our results ( 60 ) and ( 61 ) which do not admit a defined limiting value .",
    "there is a direct way of showing that the linard - wiechert result , which leads to the fields ( 21 ) , satisfies only maxwell s homogeneous equations , but the inhomogeneities are not taken into account properly .",
    "let us consider green s first identity : @xmath102 the surface integral on the left - hand - side vanishes at infinity both for the coulomb and for the lorenz potential so that the volume integral over all space on the right - hand - side must vanish as well . substituting the coulomb potential ( 25 ) together with ( 23 )",
    "one obtains an integral equation which must be satisfied by the charge density : @xmath103 where spherical coordinates centered around the position of the charge were used . if one inserts the linard - wiechert potential ( 18 ) together with ( 10 ) into ( 62 ) , one obtains : @xmath104 this integral equation depends now on the velocity which may be easily verified by choosing a constant velocity so that ( 18 ) yields : @xmath105 ^{{{1 } \\over { 2 } } } } }   \\ ;   \\ ; ,   \\ ;   \\ ;   \\ ;   \\vec { r}=   \\vec { x}-   \\left ( {   \\vec { x}_{0}+   \\vec { v }   \\ , t }   \\right)\\ ] ] both integral equations ( 63 ) and ( 64 ) can not be satisfied by the same function @xmath106 , unless the ` shape ' of the point charge would depend on the velocity , as suggested by onoochin in reference [ 3 ] .",
    "from the results obtained in sections 2 - 6 it should be evident by now that a unique gauge transformation , which transforms the lorenz potentials of a point source into the corresponding coulomb potentials , can not exist .",
    "we finally want to show this explicitly .",
    "the gauge transformation is effected by a generating function @xmath3 : @xmath107 by integrating the first relation over time one obtains immediately : @xmath108 where the lorenz potential is given by ( 18 ) and the coulomb potential by ( 25 ) .",

    "none of these results agrees with ( 67 ) .    in accordance with the previous conclusions reached in this paper we infer that no unique function @xmath3 exists which would transform the lorenz potentials of a point source into the corresponding coulomb potentials .",
    "hence , the principle of ` gauge invariance ' is not applicable to classical electrodynamics .",
    "the nature of the inconsistencies encountered in sections 2 - 5 is apparently connected to the feature of maxwell s equations of mixing elliptic and hyperbolic structures . even if the equations are reduced to wave equations like ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) or ( 50 ) and ( 51 ) , the elliptic character is still there in form of the inhomogeneity and may be made visible by the method of solution employed in section 6 .",
    "there we were compelled to conclude that the inhomogeneous wave equation does not have , as a matter of fact , a unique solution , or even leads to unphysical diverging solutions , at least in case of a moving point source . in principle , it is well known that the inhomogeneous wave equation has an infinite manifold of solutions , but it is generally believed that suppression of the advanced solutions reduces it to a physical solution , the properties of which are uniquely determined by the behaviour of the source . according to our analysis in section 6 we must maintain , however , that the inhomogeneous wave equations do not correctly describe the physical process of wave production by a moving point source .",
    "our result is not too surprising , if we realize that the inhomogeneous wave equations ( 50 ) and ( 51 ) relate the measurable fields at a certain location with temporal changes in a remote source at the _ same _ time .",
    "although both the fields and the sources in equations ( 1 - 4 ) were differentiated at time @xmath65 when , e.g. , the electric field was eliminated to obtain ( 50 ) , the retarded solutions ( 21 ) require that the differentiation of the sources is dated back to the earlier time @xmath118 .",
    "however , the source may be an extinguished star the light of which we see only now at time @xmath65 .",
    "it makes no sense to differentiate a source not existing any more which has no influence whatsoever on the light we see after a billion years . when we differentiate maxwell s equations now to obtain the wave equations for the fields , we treat the temporal changes in the sources as if they would happen now at time @xmath65 . in the retarded solutions , however , we date back the change in the sources to a remote past .",
    "this procedure is inconsistent , but inescapable due to the structure of maxwell s equations .",
    "if the same procedure would be applied to acoustic waves , one would encounter similar inconsistencies .",
    "instead , from the hydrodynamic equations one derives linearized homogeneous wave equations for the pressure and the fluid velocity .",
    "these are solved by imposing suitable boundary conditions which are determined , e.g. , by the oscillating membrane of a loudspeaker .",
    "maxwell s equations , however , lead to inhomogeneous wave equations which connect the _ travelling _ fields with the source at the _ same _ time , a _ contradictio in adjecto_. this became quite obvious in section 5 where equation ( 51 ) predicts that the _ total _ electric field is produced in a point - like region and travels within a finite time to the field point where an observer may be placed .",
    "on the other hand , equation ( 53 ) predicts that _ part _ of the field has already arrived there instantaneously , as soon as any change in the source occurred .",
    "this inconsistency can not be resolved without altering equations ( 1 - 4 ) .",
    "it is well possible that maxwell was fully aware of this problem , because in his ` treatise ' [ 7 ] he did _ not _ derive an inhomogeneous wave equation .",
    "he used the coulomb gauge and derived equation ( 24 ) .",
    "then he argued that in the ` ether ' there does not exist any current or free charge .",
    "this way he was left with : @xmath119 now he committed a formal inconsistency by concluding that the vanishing of the laplacian of the scalar potential justifies to omit also the gradient of the potential .",
    "this is , of course , not true close to a charged body . in other words",
    ", he omitted part of the ` displacement current ' , which was invented by him in the first place , in order to ` derive ' a homogeneous wave equation for the vector potential .",
    "at last he suggested that this equation should be solved by imposing cauchy - type boundary conditions on @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "the result would be a travelling vector wave from which the measurable fields could be derived with ( 6 ) at any place and time where the wave has arrived . in his last chapter xxiii ( article 862 )",
    "maxwell discusses riemann s inhomogeneous wave equation which is formally the same as lorenz s equation ( 10 ) . taking reference to clausius",
    "he states that riemann s formula is not in agreement with `` the known laws of electrodynamics '' .",
    "maxwell s method of using only a homogeneous wave equation to describe electromagnetic waves is still in practical use , when the radiation emitted by an antenna is calculated .",
    "only the homogeneous wave equation is used together with plausible boundary conditions resulting from a physics which goes beyond maxwell s equations .    in parentheses",
    "we remark that einstein gave his famous paper of 1905 the title : `` zur elektrodynamik bewegter krper '' , but the ` moving bodies ' which carry charges and currents are not treated in his analysis .",
    "he deals only with maxwell s _ homogeneous _ equations which do not lead to contradictions .",
    "the _ instantaneous _ coulomb potential is left out of the consideration .    for slowly varying fields maxwell s equations",
    "do make sense .",
    "they describe correctly the phenomenon of induction in transformers where only the instantaneous fields come into play and where the displacement current is negligible .",
    "when a condenser is charged up , the displacement current must be allowed for , but then it is only the instantaneous coulomb field which matters in practice .",
    "a quasistatic ` near field ' theory can be carried through satisfactorily , but amalgamating it with wave phenomena , in the way maxwell has tried it , leads to the contradictions which we have demonstrated .",
    "these were also recognized by dunn [ 8 ] , but not worked out in detail .",
    "may be taken as a poisson equation which has the formal solution : @xmath123 close to the charge and at small velocity @xmath80 the second term may be expected to be negligibly small so that the first integral could be considered as an approximate solution of ( a1 ) with limited applicability .",
    "this attempt to obtain a ` quasistatic ' solution was pursued by jackson [ 4 ] in order to find the interaction lagrangian between two particles moving at nonrelativistic velocities .",
    "he chose a coordinate system centered at @xmath124 and performed a partial integration : @xmath125 now the integration was straightforward and yielded : @xmath126 in order to obtain the total vector potential , the unretarded contribution from expression ( 27 ) must be added : @xmath127    it turns out , however , that the solution ( a.4 ) does not satisfy the poisson equation from which it was calculated . substituting ( a.4 ) into the left - hand - side of ( a.1 ) and ignoring the second time derivative yields : @xmath128 the distance vector @xmath129 pointing from the origin to the field point may be identified with @xmath60 , since the position of the charge was assumed at the origin .",
    "the second term of ( a.6 ) equals the right - hand - side of ( a.1 ) , but the first term yields a @xmath22 - function : @xmath130 which remains unaccounted for in ( a.1 ) .",
    "the reason for the discrepancy is that the first integral in ( a.2 ) does not converge absolutely , as we have shown in section 3 .",
    "consequently , the operations of partial integration as well as interchanging the sequence of differentiation and integration in ( a.3 ) are not permitted and lead to an incorrect result .",
    "the first integral in ( a.2 ) has , in fact , no defined limiting value as is obvious from expression ( 40 ) .    in a private communication professor jackson",
    "explained how he could obtain ( a5 ) from an expansion procedure applied on the linard - wiechert potential - which is based on the lorenz gauge - and that this was actually being done by darwin who derived ( a.5 ) in 1920 [ 5 ] .",
    "hnizdo s article _ potentials of a uniformly moving point charge in the coulomb gauge _ [ 6 ] was apparently motivated by onoochin s objections against ` mainstream ' electrodynamics as published in ref . [ 3 ] .",
    "onoochin reached conclusions which are similar to those arrived at in the present paper , namely that the electrodynamic field depends on the choice of the gauge .",
    "he speculates that the ` shape ' of the electron could depend on its velocity , an idea which was already pursued ( unsuccessfully ) by lorentz .",
    "hnizdo tries to resolve the problem by using a certain regularization procedure when the integral ( 33 ) is evaluated .",
    "both authors do not emphasize that this type of integral is conditionally convergent .",
    "this property may lead to the known fact that the value of the integral depends on the sequence of integration , on the chosen coordinate system , or on the position of the origin .",
    "a typical example is given in bronstein - semendjajew s _ taschenbuch der mathematik _",
    ", verlag harri deutsch , frankfurt , on page 347 :        hnizdo uses the formal solution ( 67 ) to obtain his formulas ( 16 - 18 ) for the difference between the vector potentials in coulomb and in lorenz gauge .",
    "he claims that these formulae do not have singularities , but this is actually not true .",
    "the @xmath133-component for the difference is , e.g. : @xmath134 if this expression is expanded around the point + @xmath135 , one obtains : @xmath136 this result is similar to our result ( 40 ) where we concluded that no limiting value exists .",
    "in fact , ( b.3 ) can assume any value between zero and infinity depending on the way how one approaches the limits @xmath137 .",
    "hnizdo avoids the ambiguity by using a regularization procedure as defined in his equation ( 32 ) .",
    "it amounts to using spherical coordinates centered around the charge point .",
    "this prescription is , however , arbitrary and lacks a rigorous justification .",
    "if one deviates from it , one finds non - uniqueness as demonstrated in our comparison of equations ( 72 ) and ( 73 ) .",
    "it should be noted that hnizdo s regularization would not work , when applied to the expression ( 70 ) for the gauge function which is incompatible with ( 67 ) .",
    "this demonstrates again that maxwell s equations do not have a unique solution ( for moving point charges ) representing a measurable well defined field .",
    "the author is deeply indebted to dr .",
    "o. kardaun for extensive and stimulating discussions of the subject .",
    "in particular , he pointed out that the vector potential in coulomb gauge leads to a conditionally convergent integral .",
    "he also pointed to the mixed character of maxwell s equations involving elliptic and hyperbolic equations .",
    "critical previous comments by professor d. pfirsch and dr .",
    "r. gruber helped to formulate the paper more concisely than originally conceived .",
    "professor pfirsch s written comments , in particular , alluded to the possibility that a gauge transformation between lorenz and coulomb potentials might not exist , as discussed in section 7 ."
