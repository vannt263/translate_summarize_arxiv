    "the cosmic microwave background radiation shows a remarkable isotropic structure of the order @xmath3 , which is taken as an evidence for the smoothness of the mass density of the universe on the largest scales comparable to the hubble radius ( wilkinson 1987 ) , @xmath4 mpc ( @xmath5 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the existence of galaxies and clusters of galaxies as well as the ( larger than unity ) amplitude of the galaxy - galaxy correlation function ( peebles 1980 ) indicate that the universe possesses a highly irregular structure on scales less than 10@xmath0 mpc .    on intermediate scales , ranging from about 30@xmath0 mpc to around 2000@xmath0 mpc",
    ", the existing data do not allow a conclusive interpretation about the mass density distribution of the universe .",
    "nevertheless , there are a number of different observations suggesting that the structure on these scales is quite varied .",
    "the most interesting of these observations include the voids with sizes greater than 30@xmath0 mpc observed in the distribution of bright galaxies ( kirschner et al .",
    "1981 ; de lapparent et al . 1986 )",
    "the ( larger than unity ) amplitude of the cluster - cluster correlation function on scales up to 30@xmath0 mpc , the peculiar velocity field in our local vicinity on a scale of about 50@xmath0 mpc , and the  great wall \" at a distance of approximately 100@xmath0 mpc ( geller & huchra 1980 ) . also , noteworthy is the analysis of the spatial distribution of superclusters on the intermediate scales ( einasto et al .",
    "1997 ) . for this analysis a sample of more than 200 superclusters (",
    "systems with more than 8 clusters where the distances between nearest - neighbors among member clusters do not exceed 24@xmath0 mpc ) was used , where the estimated redshift of simple members reaches up to @xmath7 ( around 1/4 of the redshift reached in the pencil - beam galactic surveys ) .",
    "these three - dimensional data of the distribution of superclusters has been used to calculate the correlation function as well as the power spectrum . in the analysis of the power spectrum",
    "it was found that it is characterized by a peak with a wavelength of ( @xmath8 mpc .",
    "but probably the most puzzling discovery concerns the recent observations which show an apparent periodicity in the distribution of redshifts in pencil - beam surveys of the north and south galactic polar regions ( broadhurst et al .",
    "these surveys extend to a redshift of around @xmath9 in both directions , and there is a strong evidence for a periodicity of 128@xmath0 mpc which extends for over 13 periods .",
    "although this result was considered initially as a statistical anomaly ( kaiser & peacock 1991 ) , later and more detailed studies ( kopylov et al .",
    "1988 ; mo et al . 1992 ; fetisova et al . 1993 ; einasto & gramann 1993 ; szalay et al .",
    "1993 ; einasto et al .",
    "1997 ) provided new evidence for the alluded periodicity on the same scales .",
    "if this periodicity would be established in most directions , a naive interpretation would imply that galaxies and clusters are distributed on concentric shells centered around our galaxy , clearly a blow to our cosmological conceptions .",
    "another more plausible explanation is based upon the idea that the observed periodicity is just a visual effect induced by a periodic oscillation of the gravitational constant ( morikawa 1990 ; hill , steinhardt & turner 1990 ; salgado , quevedo & sudarsky 1996 , 1997 ; quevedo , salgado & sudarsky 1997 ; sudarsky , quevedo & salgado 1998 ) , and that the mass density of the universe on intermediate scales remains homogeneous and isotropic as on the largest scales .",
    "this explanation requires the introduction of a time - dependent scalar field into the model ( the oscillating @xmath10 model ) which is non - minimally coupled to gravity .    in view of the remarkable conclusions that would derive from any of these explanations",
    "it seems imperative to consider whether the observations are likely to occur in the absence of these scenarios , and can be the result of chance augmented with the assumption of the presence of structure at the appropriate scale but with an otherwise random distribution",
    ". we will study the plausibility of this latter explanation inspired on the idea , suggested by szalay et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , that the structure of the universe on these scales consists of a regular network of superclusters and voids with a step size of the order of the wavelength discovered in the power spectrum .",
    "the specific structure that is studied by van de weygaert ( 1991 ) and subba rao and szalay ( 1992 ) resembles a collection of honeycombs or a three - dimensional chess - board .",
    "such structures known as voronoi foams result in a reasonable probability for the observation of a periodicity similar to that in the actual observations .    the aim of this work is to investigate whether it is sufficient to have a universe with an intrinsic length scale in its large scale structure in order to explain the observation of the periodicity mentioned above . in particular , the present work can be seen as a test of the suggestion that a hypothetical `` built - in scale in the initial spectrum '' arising from double inflation models and supported by cosmic microwave background radiation data ( einasto , 1997 ) , could be the explanation of the above mentioned periodicity .",
    "therefore , we will consider a model that does not introduce any other large scale pattern besides the existence of the above mentioned characteristic scale .",
    "needless is to say that neither our model nor the voronoi foam models are anything more than `` toy '' models as they lack , for example , a proven dynamical scenario for their formation starting from reasonable initial data .",
    "we want to construct a simple realization of such a model .",
    "we will do this by assuming that the galaxies are evenly distributed over the surface of three - dimensional spheres with an average radius comparable with the appropriate scale , with the spheres themselves randomly distributed in the universe . in a universe filled by these spheres we choose a point as the `` observational site '' and perform a statistical analysis to investigate the probability of observing a periodic distribution with the characteristics of those reported in ( broadhurst et al .",
    "1990 ) in a particular direction .",
    "we obtain an upper bound for the value of such probability of the order @xmath11 , a value that obviously excludes the alluded structure as an acceptable explanation of the observations . the assumption that the galaxies are homogeneously distributed on the surface of the spheres",
    "is not expected to affect the main result of our numerical analysis in the direction that would invalidate this upper bound .",
    "we have taken the radii of the spheres to have a gaussian distribution centered around the mean value of 80@xmath0 mpc and analyzed the results for different choices of the standard deviation @xmath12 of the distribution ( namely with @xmath13 mpc ) .",
    "we have implemented a code that simulates the universe as a three - dimensional volume of @xmath14 filled by these spheres subjected to the condition that the spheres do not intersect with each other . in figure 1 ,",
    "a two - dimensional section of this volume is depicted .",
    "we emphasize that the above condition of no - sphere overlapping and the gaussian distribution on the spheres radii imply that the numerical process of filling the toy universe stalls after a certain number of spheres . after that stage",
    ", the inclusion of more spheres demands a very long computing time .",
    "the adequate number of spheres needed to fill the universe is not fixed in advance , but the important point is that such a number must be so that the correlation function of the matter in the universe exhibits a characteristic scale , which is the most important aspect in the scenario that we are testing . we have confirmed that once correlations are present the results become insensitive to a further increase in the number of spheres .    in order to check the appearance of scale ,",
    "we have computed a two - point correlation function defined in the following way .",
    "let @xmath15 be the total number of spheres in the toy universe , and let @xmath16 be the number of sphere centers contained between two concentric shells with radii @xmath17 and @xmath18 around the center @xmath19 ( with @xmath20 mpc @xmath0 ) .",
    "the number density of sphere centers within @xmath17 and @xmath18 is then given by @xmath21 this is to be constant if correlations between neighbors at all scales are absent .",
    "it is customary to extract from this , the excess density number by defining the two - point correlation function as the difference between the above density distribution and the mean density of sphere - center number : @xmath22 more specifically , @xmath23 corresponds to the mean of @xmath24 at scales for which @xmath24 is nearly constant ( i.e. , @xmath25 at those scales ) .",
    "if the universe has a characteristic length scale we expect it will be evident in the plot of the correlation function .",
    "the results are shown in figure 2 with a typical number @xmath26 .",
    "we can appreciate the presence of a characteristic scale at distances which are comparable to the mean value of the spheres radii , and stress that such scale is already present when the spheres fill a volume of only about 25% of the total volume of the toy universe .",
    "we do not expect any drastic changes in the qualitative as well as in the quantitative behavior of the correlation function if we increase the number of spheres in the universe .",
    "moreover , as shown in figure 2 , the resulting length scale is almost independent of the value of @xmath12 considered .",
    "now we will estimate the probability of observing in a specific direction a periodicity like the one seen in the real observations . to this end",
    "we note that the power spectrum of the observations in szalay et al .",
    "( 1993 ) revealed a peak at a frequency corresponding to 128@xmath0 mpc which contained 23% of the total integrated power .",
    "thus we need to estimate the probability of observing in a specific direction a matter distribution with a power spectrum containing a peak with approximately the same percentage of the total power .",
    "the `` observational site '' has been chosen to be a vertex of the box which in fact represents an octant of a larger toy - universe . this particular choice allows to consider the longest possible extent for the line of sight in each direction , but it does not affect the result of the statistical analysis which is performed for about 10@xmath27 directions and for `` pencil - beams '' extending approximately to 5000@xmath0 mpc .    in this model",
    "each direction corresponds to a numerical pencil - beam , that is , a straight line which intersects several spheres , each intersection thus representing high - density spots .",
    "the ensemble of the distance separations between the spots results thus in a one - dimensional distribution of matter along the line of sight , which we represented mathematically by an ensemble of step functions of width @xmath28 mpc @xmath0 with height normalized to unity centered on each intersection of the line of sight with the surface of a sphere .",
    "we have also consider the effect of replacing step functions by gaussian functions and showed that this does not change the probability estimates beyond the statistical error bars .",
    "finally , we have performed a fourier analysis of this distribution and confronted the resulting power spectrum with the observational one .",
    "figure 3 shows the resulting power spectrum of the matter distribution in a representative direction .",
    "we note that there is a substantial power at high frequencies , a feature associated with the use of step functions that is slightly suppressed by the use of gaussian functions .    in order to compare with the real observations we look in each direction for the peak containing most of the power .",
    "we then calculate the percentage @xmath29 of the power - content within the peak : = 100  .",
    "as we mentioned , this procedure has been applied to 10@xmath27 different directions starting from the specific site described above , obtaining representative peaks with values @xmath29 at different frequencies in each case .",
    "the distribution of the number of peaks with a given @xmath29 is plotted in figure 4 as a function of its corresponding wavelength .",
    "we note that most of the highest peaks cluster around a specific wavelength of @xmath30 mpc @xmath0 , however the power contained in most of them represents barely 2% of the corresponding total integrated power ( see for instance the figure 3 ) .",
    "since one can define the probability of observing a periodicity in a certain direction as the number of directions in which the periodicity is present over the total number of directions , one should analyze an adequate sample in which one observes a sufficient number of cases with the desired periodicity .",
    "since the sample of 10@xmath27 directions showed no periodicity with a peak having the required power @xmath31 , one should be tempted to give only an upper bound of 10@xmath32 for the probability of observing that value .",
    "this is not the best upper bound that can be obtained and it is only determined by the finiteness of the computing time .",
    "we have been able nevertheless to improve on this bound by the following procedure : we have fitted our data for the probability @xmath33 of a peak with a given percentage @xmath29 of the power as a function of that percentage to various analytical expressions and found that this function is very well fitted by a power law : [ fit ] p ( ) = c ^ + where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are constants with values depending on the chosen @xmath12 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "this allows us to extrapolate the probability of finding the observed periodicity with @xmath36 in a given direction .",
    "lccc @xmath12 & @xmath34 & @xmath35 & @xmath37 + 30 & 2.446564 @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 1.722128 @xmath38 @xmath39 & @xmath41 @xmath40 0.20 & 0.401 + 15 & 2.390874 @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 1.682928 @xmath38 @xmath39 & @xmath42 @xmath40 0.20 & 0.377 + 5 & 1.3196748 @xmath38 @xmath43 @xmath40 1.0245539 @xmath38 @xmath43 & @xmath44 @xmath40 0.31 & 2.468",
    "+    an example of this law for @xmath45 mpc is shown in figure 5 .",
    "a similar fit was made for the cases with other values of @xmath12 with the remarkable result that the power law is practically unaffected .",
    "this is a strong evidence for the robustness of our results .",
    "we also stress that the data - set fitted to the above power law has values of @xmath37 , which according to the degrees of freedom of the data ( @xmath46 ) , indicates the good quality of the fits ( see table 1 ) .",
    "this allows to make confident predictions for the probability of observing the value of @xmath47 which corresponds to the observations of szalay et al .",
    "( 1993 ) . from ( [ fit ] ) one easily concludes that the value of @xmath48 ranges in the interval @xmath49 .",
    "this interval is determined by taking into account the statistical uncertainties of the fits .",
    "this implies that the probability of obtaining a peak with the observational power - content is at most 10@xmath50 .",
    "needless to say that this result completely discards the possibility of detecting the observed periodicity in a universe with this kind of structure .",
    "as we have stressed , we have performed a similar analysis replacing the step functions by gaussian functions with the result that the upper bound for the probability @xmath33 remains essentially unaffected and all the values of @xmath33 remain within the interval determined by the statistical uncertainties .",
    "it should be emphasized that in this work we are considering the possibility of detecting periodicity in a particular direction under the _ sole _ assumption that there exists an intrinsic length scale in the galaxy distribution .",
    "our results show that this probability is completely negligible .",
    "however , this result could drastically be changed within a different model which would be characterized not only by a length scale but also by the presence of a specific correlation in the spatial distribution of galaxies . a concrete example of a model with this type of additional structure has been investigated ( van de weygaert , 1991 ; subba rao & szalay , 1992 ) . in these works , dynamical voronoi foams ( icke & van de weygaert , 1987 ; van de weygaert & icke , 1989 ) with a controlled amount of randomness are proposed as describing the spatial galactic distribution .",
    "the probability for finding periodicity in these models depends on the amount of randomness and can drastically be increased from 3% up to 15% .",
    "this probability can reach even higher values ( 10% to 40% ) in the case of a regular lattice ( kurki - suonio et al . ,",
    "1990 ) . in the extreme and naive model of galaxies distributed on the surfaces of concentric shells , one",
    "obviously would obtain a 100% probability for an observer at the center .",
    "we want to stress that the models that are more easily reconciled with acceptable cosmological scenarios are those that introduce a priori the least amount of scale order , and such that the order introduced corresponds to the smallest possible scale . in this sense",
    "the models that introduce just a characteristic length scale and no other large scale order should be considered as constituting the most viable explanations for the observations .",
    "the conclusion and the main result of our analysis is that the existence of a specific scale in the distribution of mass density of the universe , as showed by a two - point correlation function , does not by itself provide a satisfactory explanation for the spatial periodicity of 128@xmath0 mpc in the galaxy distribution of deep pencil - beam surveys as it results in a negligible probability for such observation to be obtained in a particular direction .",
    "this result seems to force us again to look for alternative explanations for the observations of periodicity in deep pencil - beam surveys . on the other hand",
    ", it might be interesting to consider variations of this type of model ( for exemple , changing the intersection rule ) to identify the features that lead to an enhaced probability for obtaining the desired periodicity .",
