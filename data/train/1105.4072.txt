    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one of the most interesting features in the immediate vicinity of the @xmath9 , @xmath7 crossing was pointed out by perru  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and consists in an apparent over occupation of the neutron @xmath12 orbit , starting already for @xmath13 , and a concomitant strong proton core polarization effect .",
    "these phenomena were invoked to explain the sudden and large increase of a reduced transition probability @xmath14 observed between @xmath15ni@xmath11 and @xmath16ni@xmath17 .",
    "independently , there has been considerable accumulation of experimental evidences pointing toward a sudden structural change from @xmath7 to @xmath18 in the ge chain .",
    "this change was originally inferred from the analysis of nucleon transfer cross sections  @xcite and was seen to be also present in the se chain  @xcite though somewhat attenuated .",
    "this phenomenon is also clear when considering @xmath14 and @xmath19 data  @xcite .",
    "it was soon admitted that the ge and se nuclei undergo a maximum of collectivity ( in the most general sense ) at @xmath6  @xcite and that a new collectivity regime ( the nature of which will be discussed in last section ) develops at this particular neutron number to the end of the neutron @xmath12 shell . from the comparison with ge and",
    "se systematics one could naturally expect a maximum of collectivity at @xmath6 , or more generally structural change from @xmath7 to @xmath18 , also in the zn chain .",
    "in addition , the microscopic mechanism that would connect the strong polarization effect affecting the @xmath14 value in @xmath16ni@xmath17 to the @xmath6 collectivity maximum in ge and se is still difficult to establish in a direct way .",
    "the over occupation of the neutron @xmath12 orbit for @xmath20 , already hinted at in ref .",
    "@xcite , is confirmed by recent shell - model calculations  @xcite : this can be seen , for instance , in fig .",
    "24 of ref .",
    "@xcite , which shows calculated occupation of the neutron @xmath12 orbit in the @xmath21 and @xmath22 of the even - even ge chain .",
    "however , in these calculations the proton @xmath23 orbit is not included in the valence space and the effect of the proton core polarization can not be quantified directly _",
    "i.e. _ if such an effect is indeed accounted for , it is only through a very indirect way , that is _ via _ some modification of the residual interaction after fitting some of the two - body matrix elements to data on nuclei close to @xmath9 .",
    "more recently shell - model calculations in a larger valence space including the @xmath24 shell for protons and the @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath12 and @xmath28 orbitals for neutrons became available  @xcite .",
    "the strong increase of @xmath14 values from @xmath15ni@xmath11 to @xmath16ni@xmath17 is somewhat reproduced using standard effective charges but not quite ( see fig .  5 in ref .",
    "interestingly , a second calculation in the same valence space but with a slightly revised version of the residual interaction worsens a little bit the result  @xcite , as if the inclusion of the @xmath29 quadrupole partners @xmath30-@xmath31 , contrary to what had been expected earlier , was not a sufficient ingredient to explain the apparent increase of `` collectivity '' in ni between @xmath7 and @xmath18 .",
    "even - even zn nuclei close to @xmath7 should then provide the ideal test ground if one is to try to pin down the potential connection between the two phenomena : strong proton core polarization and maximum of collectivity at @xmath6 .    in this paper we propose to address this question by means of a direct lifetime measurement of the @xmath32 state in @xmath33zn@xmath17 and @xmath34zn@xmath35 .",
    "we expect in that way to get a more accurate evaluation of the @xmath14 values than those obtained from the previous scattering cross - section measurements @xcite , which are generally sensitive to the energy regime and/or model dependent in some way .",
    "in particular , when not all the @xmath36 strength connecting the lowest - lying states can be observed which is usually the case in radioactive beam experiments some value for the quadrupole moment of the @xmath37 state must be assumed . such kind of assumptions is particularity hazardous in a region of transitional nuclei characterized by subtle and complicated collective effects .",

    ".  @xcite ) .",
    "that would mean that some correlation effects are at play .",
    "for the sake of the present discussion , we just consider it as an empirical fact .",
    "then the simplest explanation of the observed structure transition from @xmath7 to 42 might originate from a federman - pittel  @xcite like phenomenon .",
    "since , as shown by all recent large - scale shell - model calculations neutrons are already present in the @xmath12 orbital before the @xmath7 crossing , any increase of the population of an orbit with large orbital angular momentum , like @xmath25 , would trigger the deformation driving proton - neutron interaction .",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath25 have equal radial number and @xmath147 . furthermore , both have relatively large orbital angular momenta .",
    "hence , following the ideas developed by federman and pittel , criteria for a strong proton - neutron interaction effect are indeed met .",
    "this should be enough to qualitatively explain the onset of collectivity ( in the sense described above ) from @xmath7 to 42 . in ref .",
    "@xcite the strong proton core polarization beyond @xmath7 was already ascribed to the attractive @xmath148-@xmath149 monopole interaction .    in order to understand why the collectivity maximum at @xmath6 reveals through @xmath8-softness one should consider additional arguments .",
    "it is well known that the presence of orbitals , nearby the fermi level , with high number of nodal planes parallel to the symmetry axis , @xmath150 , broadens the potential curve in the @xmath8 coordinate . here , @xmath151 , where @xmath152 and @xmath153 are the principal quantum number and number of nodes along the symmetry axis in the @xmath154 $ ] nilsson labeling , respectively .",
    "in the beginning of a deformation region , all orbitals have low @xmath150 except those stemming from the lower shells , which , on the contrary have maximum @xmath150 . in our specific case",
    ", this corresponds to the influence of the proton @xmath155 $ ] orbital stemming from the underlying @xmath23 spherical shell . in shell - model language",

    "new values available from the present work are represented in red .",
    "the solid line is to guide the eye . ]",
    "microscopic description of the @xmath15ni region has recently reached a high degree of precision in the framework of the shell model .",
    "impressive agreement between experimental and calculated magnetic moments of odd neutron - rich copper ground states has been achieved  @xcite .",
    "one of the major conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite is that the only way to obtain such good agreement is by allowing proton core excitations ( promotion of proton from the @xmath23 across the @xmath9 gap ) in the calculations .",
    "an even larger valence space ( @xmath158-shell orbitals for protons and @xmath159 orbitals for neutrons ) , allowing also neutron excitations across the @xmath160 gap , has been used to account for the island of inversion phenomena in neutron - rich cr region  @xcite . a slightly revised version of the lnps interaction of ref .",
    "@xcite was produced by sieja and nowacki  @xcite which allows improved agreement with the experimental @xmath161 , @xmath14 values and @xmath162 factors in the zn isotopic chain  @xcite . a transition from @xmath7 to @xmath6",
    "is also observed in the experimental @xmath163 factors of the @xmath32 states of zn .",
    "the results of those calculations for the @xmath14 values are reported in fig .",
    "[ znsys ] . while the agreement is perfect up to @xmath7 the theoretical curve",
    "is systematically shifted upwards from @xmath6 on .",

    "@xcite decreases the calculated @xmath14 value for the @xmath6 isotone @xmath16ni ( degrading the agreement with experiment ) , while it is already too large for @xmath33zn as only two protons are added . in fig .",
    "[ znsys ] , the results from calculations performed in the valence space restricted to @xmath164 using the jun45 interaction  @xcite with standard effective charges ( @xmath156 and @xmath157 ) are also reported for comparison .",
    "it is quite clear that the extension to the much larger valence space including also @xmath165 and @xmath166 represents a decisive improvement , being crucial for getting the necessary degrees of freedom thus allowing the collectivity to develop at the correct magnitude .",
    "however , we hope that this discussion calls for a more careful balance of the collectivity which is brought in by the inclusion in the valence space of the like quadrupole partners @xmath167-@xmath168 with respect to the influence of the proton - neutron @xmath169-@xmath167 interaction and to some extent , the influence of proton - core excitations .",
    "in summary , the lifetime measurement of the 2@xmath0 states in @xmath1zn has been performed at the lise spectrometer at ganil using the rdds method .",
    "the lifetime values were determined to be 17.9(18 ) and 27.0(24 )  ps for @xmath1zn , respectively , which correspond to @xmath170 and @xmath75  @xmath171@xmath172 .",
    "the @xmath14 systematics obtained in the present work , when added to a careful inspection of other experimental quantities available for the neighboring nuclei , brings new support to the idea of a systematic maximum of collectivity at @xmath6 for zn , ge and se nuclei .",
    "in addition , available signatures from the experimental spectra point towards a transition from a spherical oscillator at @xmath7 to complete @xmath8-softness at @xmath6 . from the whole body of data",
    "@xmath19 should be @xmath87 for @xmath33zn and close to it for @xmath34zn , a value which is compatible with our data .",
