    "the study of the conformational behavior of polymers near surfaces is a fascinating field , both from a physical and chemical perspective .",
    "it provides a rewarding playground for basic and applied research . with the advent of new sophisticated experimental techniques offering an enormous potential in polymer and surface research",
    ", the interest in the hybrid interface of organic and inorganic matter has increased . among such techniques at the nanometer scale",
    "is , for example , atomic force microscopy ( afm ) , where it is possible to measure the contour length and the end - to - end distance of individual polymers  @xcite or to quantitatively investigate the peptide adhesion on semiconductor surfaces  @xcite .",
    "another experimental tool with an extraordinary resolution in positioning and accuracy in force measurements are optical tweezers  @xcite .",
    "applications for adsorption phenomena in polymeric solutions can be found in such different fields as lubrication , adhesion and surface protection , steric stabilization of colloidal particles , as well as in biological processes of membrane - polymer interaction .",
    "the understanding of the latter is particularly important for the reconstruction of cell processes .",
    "the knowledge of structure formation processes near interfaces is also a prerequisite for designing micro- or nanostructures providing a large variety of possible applications in nanotechnology .    despite much efforts in the past ,",
    "the solvent - quality - dependent behavior of a dilute polymer solution exposed to an adsorbing substrate is not yet fully understood . in good",
    "solvent , dominating structures are random coils since the monomers and the solvent molecules attract each other and , consequently , solvent molecules accumulate between monomers and push the monomers apart . also at high temperatures , random coils are favored as they possess a higher conformational entropy than globular conformations .",
    "reducing the temperature , the more compact low - energy conformations gain thermodynamic weight , and the polymer collapses in a cooperative rearrangement of the monomers . at the @xmath0-temperature , where the self - avoidance effect and the solvent effect exactly cancel , the size of a flexible polymer scales like an ideal chain , that is , @xmath1 , with @xmath2 .",
    "globular conformations are highly compact but have only little internal structure .",
    "hence those conformations are still entropy - dominated , and a further transition toward low - degenerate crystalline energetic states is expected and indeed observed : the freezing transition  @xcite .",
    "the presence of an attractive surface strongly affects the behavior of the polymer in the vicinity of the interface .",
    "the monomer - monomer attraction , being responsible for the collapse below the @xmath0-point , and the surface - monomer attraction , resulting in the adsorption , compete with each other .",
    "this competition gives rise to a variety of different conformational phases .",
    "the polymer adsorbs at the surface , if the temperature is decreased below the adsorption transition temperature , but at high temperatures only a small number of monomers is in contact with the surface , even if the polymer was grafted to it  @xcite .",
    "this is due to the lower entropy of conformations spread out on the surface , compared to the behavior in bulk .",
    "numerous detailed studies have been performed to elucidate the conformational behavior of homopolymers and heteropolymers near substrates .",
    "compared to experiments , computer simulations have the advantage that combinations of parameters can be varied at will .",
    "theoretical studies have , for example , been performed analytically using scaling theory  @xcite , mean - field density functional theory  @xcite , and series expansion  @xcite and numerically by employing off - lattice models such as a bead - spring model of a single polymer chain grafted to a weakly attractive surface  @xcite , multiscale modelling  @xcite , monte carlo studies of lattice homopolymers  @xcite , molecular dynamics combined with a stretching of an adsorbed homopolymer  @xcite , or exact enumeration  @xcite .",
    "also adsorption - desorption dynamics were investigated in brownian dynamics simulations of coarse - grained models  @xcite .",
    "+ in this study , we performed multicanonical monte carlo computer simulations in order to analyze thermodynamic properties of the adsorption of a semiflexible polymer at a flat and unstructured , attractive substrate .",
    "our main objective is the classification of the structural phases accompanying the adsorption process and the construction of the complete ( pseudo)phase diagram parametrized by the temperature and a suitably introduced solvent - quality parameter .",

    "we employ a coarse - grained off - lattice model for semiflexible homopolymers that has also been generalized for studies of heteropolymers  @xcite and helped to understand protein folding channels from a mesoscopic perspective  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to earlier adsorption studies of lattice polymers  @xcite , we here accept the associated additional computational cost of an off - lattice model in order to get rid of undesired effects of underlying lattice symmetries .    as on the lattice",
    ", we assume that adjacent monomers are connected by rigid covalent bonds .",
    "thus , the distance @xmath3 is fixed and set to unity",
    ". bond and torsional angles are free to rotate .",
    "the energy function consists of three terms , @xmath4 associated with the bending stiffness ( @xmath5 ) , monomer - monomer lennard - jones interaction ( @xmath6 ) , and monomer - surface attraction ( @xmath7 ) .",

    "the parameter @xmath28 defines the surface attraction strength , and as such it weighs the energy scales of intrinsic monomer - monomer attraction and monomer - surface attraction .    a distance @xmath29 away from the attractive surface , we place a steric wall that is necessary to prevent the molecule from escaping . because the exact form of the density of states depends on the box height @xmath30",
    ", all measured quantities also depend on the choice of @xmath30 .",
    "as soon as the box size exceeds the polymer size , however , the influence on the observables , apart from the substrate distance of the center - of - mass @xmath31 of the polymer , is sufficiently small .",

    "therefore , all information regarding the phase behavior of the system  typically governed by the competition between entropy and energy  is encoded in @xmath38 . consequently",
    ", for a detailed global analysis of the phase behavior , a precisely estimated density of states is extremely helpful .",
    "unfortunately , the density of states covers many orders of magnitude in the phase transition regimes , so that its estimation requires the application of sophisticated generalized - ensemble monte - carlo methods .    for our analyses",
    ", we have performed multicanonical simulations  @xcite , as multicanonical sampling allows the estimation of @xmath38 , in principle , within a single simulation .",
    "the idea of the multicanonical method is to increase the sampling rate of conformations being little favored in the free - energy landscape and , finally , to perform a random walk in energy space .",

    "the implementation of multicanonical sampling is not straightforward as the multicanonical weights @xmath44 are obviously unknown a priori .",
    "therefore , starting with @xmath45 , the weights have to be determinded by an iterative procedure until the multicanonical histogram is almost  flat  , that is , if the estimate for the density of states after the @xmath46th run , @xmath47 , satisfies @xmath48 in the desired range of energies .",
    "an efficient , error - weighted estimation method for the multicanonical weights is described in detail in refs @xcite and @xcite .",
    "eventually , if eq [ eq : constdos ] is reasonably satisfied , the multicanonical weights @xmath49^{-1}$ ] are then used in a final long production run , where all quantities of interest are measured and stored in a time - series file .",

    "although for both investigated polymer lengths the energy varies smoothly with changing @xmath34 and @xmath28 ( with a global minimum at minimal temperature and maximal surface attraction ) , two transitions can be identified as ridges in the profile of the specific heat : the first one is the _ adsorption transition _ separating desorbed and adsorbed conformations . the other transition is sort of a _ freezing transition _ at low temperatures . near @xmath77 , the specific heat exhibits a pronounced peak and decreases rapidly at lower temperatures , independently of the surface attraction strength .",
    "the low - temperature peak in specific heat and the crystalline shape of structures found in this regime signalize this freezing transition .",
    "although the freezing temperature seems to be rather constant , the type of crystalline structure adopted by the polymer depends strongly on @xmath28 . for the identification of the polymer shapes",
    ", we take in the next subsection a closer look at the conformational quantities .",
    "the radius of gyration provides an excellent measure of the globular compactness of polymer conformations .",
    "figures [ fig : rgyr3d ] and [ fig : rgyre3d ] reveal that the most compact conformations dominate at low temperatures and for small values of surface attraction strengths @xmath28 .",
    "the freezing transition can be found at the same temperature , as it has already been identified from the specific heat .",
    "the adsorption transition typically affects only segments of the polymer and is thus not prominently signaled by the radius of gyration .",
    "this is different for its components parallel ( figures [ fig : rgyrxy ] and [ fig : rgyrxye ] ) and perpendicular ( figures [ fig : rgyrz ] and [ fig : rgyrze ] ) to the surface , respectively .",
    "for example , for @xmath78 , @xmath79 vanishes at low temperatures for the 20mer , whereas @xmath80 attains low values at lower @xmath28 .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath79 corresponds to conformations where the polymer is spread out flat on the surface without any extension into the third dimension .",

    ", width=328 ]    to verify that conformations in ac1 are indeed maximally compact single layers , we argue as follows .",
    "the most compact shape in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) continuous space is the circular disk .",
    "thus , one can calculate @xmath80 for a disk and compare it with the simulated value .",
    "assuming @xmath16 monomers to be distributed evenly in the disk , @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the radius of the disk in units of the mean distance of neighboring monomers .",
    "the radius of gyration in the same units is thus given by @xmath85 since we have two types of mean distances between monomers in compact conformations dependent on whether they are adjacent along the chain or not , we expect for disk - like conformations an the surface : @xmath86 .",
    "the simulated value is @xmath87 , which nicely fits the estimate .",
    "the equivalent estimate for the 13mer also confirms discoidal conformations in ac1 .",
    "the argument is similar for sphere - like three - dimensional ( 3d ) compact conformations with @xmath88 .",
    "corresponding conformations are found as free desorbed compact chains ( dc ) , as well as adsorbed compact polymer conformations ( ac2a ) for weak surface attraction . in this case , the radius of gyration is given by @xmath89 the estimates @xmath90 , and @xmath91 slightly overestimate the simulated values @xmath92 and @xmath93 . the deviations can be explained by the fact that the mass of the polymer is not uniformly distributed in the sphere as it is assumed in the calculation . for a compact packing of discrete monomer positions , it is more realistic that the outer thin shell of the sphere does not contain any monomers .",
    "performing the integration not from @xmath94 to @xmath95 , but only to @xmath96 , reduces the estimated radius of gyration significantly already for small @xmath97 due to the increased weight of the outer shells in higher dimensions . taking this effect into account ,",
    "the thus obtained values of @xmath98 seem to be even more reasonable .",
    "the most pronounced transition is the strong layering transition at @xmath99 for @xmath100 that separates regions of planar conformations ( ac1 , ae1 ) in the @xmath34-@xmath28 plane from the region of stable double - layer structures ( ac2b ) and adsorbed globules ( ag ) , below and above the freezing transition , respectively . for high surface attraction strengths",
    "@xmath28 , it is energetically favorable to form as many surface contacts as possible . in the layering - transition region",
    ", a higher number of monomer - monomer contacts causes the double - layer structures to have just the same energy as single - layer structures . for lower @xmath28 values ,",

    "what follows for lower @xmath28 values after a seemingly continuous transition is a low - temperature subphase of surface attached compact conformations , called ac2a .",
    "ac2a conformations occur if the monomer - surface attraction is not strong enough to induce a layering in compact attached structures .",
    "the characterization of structures in this subphase requires some care , as system - size effects are dominant .",
    "although the surface attraction is sufficiently strong to enable polymer - substrate contacts , compact desorbed polymer conformations below the @xmath0-transition are not expected to change much .",
    "thus , layering effects do not occur .",
    "we found two distinct classes of structures in this region : ( 1 ) completely undistorted compact conformations touching the surface and ( 2 ) semispherically shaped structures docked at the surface .",
    "for the rather short chains in our study , the occurrence of these shapes strongly depends on the precise number of monomers .",
    "not surprisingly , we find differences for the 13mer and the 20mer .    for @xmath104 , both components of the radius of gyration , @xmath105 and @xmath101 , indicate a transition at @xmath106 .",

    "the higher the @xmath28 value , the larger the average number of monomers being docked at the surface , but a clear cut from the compact adsorbed conformations does not exist .",
    "this difference in the wetting transition for @xmath104 and @xmath100 might be due to the fact that the most compact conformation for @xmath104 is an almost perfect icosahedron  @xcite .",
    "`` almost '' because the length scales of covalent bonds and intermonomeric lennard - jones interaction differ slightly .",
    "we also searched for low - energy states with a modified lj energy minimum distance shifted to unity and indeed found perfectly icosahedral morphologies .",
    "this additionally stabilizes the polymer conformation and is already known from studies of atomic clusters .",
    "the smallest mackay icosahedron @xcite with characteristic 5-fold symmetry is formed by 13 atoms .",
    "larger perfect icosahedra also require a `` magic '' number ( 55 , 147 , 309 ,  ) of atoms .",
    "this holds also true for crystals of elastic polymers@xcite .",

    "the conformations in ac and ac2a thus do not exhibit a pronounced number of surface contacts , and @xmath118 varies with @xmath28 . near @xmath126 , where the polymer desorbs , @xmath118 converges rapidly to @xmath127 as @xmath128 . to conclude , the single- to double - layer `` layering transition '' is a topological transition from 2d to 3d polymer conformations adsorbed at the substrate .",
    "the solvent - exposed part of the adsorbed compact polymer structure , which is not in direct contact with the substrate , reduces under poor solvent conditions the contact surface to the solvent . because of the larger number of degrees of freedom for the off - lattice polymer , layered structures are not favored in this case .",
    "thus , higher - order layering transitions are not identified in our analyses ( which in part is also due to the short lengths of the chains ) but are also not expected in pronounced form .",
    "the observable left to discuss is the mean number of intrinsic contacts .",
    "it behaves very much like the radius of gyration , such that the projection of @xmath129 onto the @xmath34-@xmath28-plane is divided into a compact regime comprising ac , ag , ac2a , ac2b , dc , and dg and a regime of less compact conformations .",
    "this nicely confirms the results already obtained .      to summarize all the informations gained from the different observables , we construct the approximate boundaries of different regimes in the @xmath34-@xmath28 plane .",
    "the pseudophase diagram was already displayed in figure [ fig:4 ] where the different pseudophases are denoted by the abbreviations explained in the previous subsection .",
    "the pseudophases found are ( for selected representative conformations see figure [ fig:5 ] ) :    * * de * ( desorbed expanded ) : random - coil phase of the quasifree desorbed polymer . *",
    "* dg * ( desorbed globular ) : globular phase of the desorbed chain . *",
    "* dc * ( desorbed compact ) : maximally compact , spherically shaped crystalline structures dominate this desorption phase below the freezing - transition temperatue . * * ae1 * ( adsorbed expanded single layer ) : adsorbed phase of expanded , rather planar but little compact random - coil conformations . * * ae2 * ( adsorbed expanded 3d conformations ) : adsorbed , unstructured random - coil - like expanded conformations with typically more than half of the monomers in contact with the attractive substrate are favored in this pseudophase . * * ac1 * ( adsorbed compact single layer ) : phase of adsorbed circularly compact filmlike conformations . *",
    "* ag * ( adsorbed globular 3d conformations ) : representative conformations are surface - attached globular conformations and look like drops on the surface . * * ac2a * ( adsorbed compact 3d conformations ) : compact , semispherically shaped crystalline conformations dominate in this subphase . * * ac2b * ( adsorbed compact double layers ) : subphase of adsorbed , compact double - layer conformations .",
    "the occupation of the surface layer is slightly larger than that of the other layer .",
    "ac2a and ac2b are subphases in the regime of the phase diagram , where adsorbed compact and topologically three - dimensional conformations are dominant .",
    "since pronounced layering transitions as observed in lattice - polymer studies are not expected here , the discriminations of ac2a and ac2b is likely to be irrelevant in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however , ac2a , b differ qualitatively from the phase ac1 of topologically 2d polymer films and we thus expect that the transition between filmlike ( ac1 ) and semispherical conformations ( ac2 ) is of thermodynamic relevance .    for @xmath104 , where the maximally compact conformation is more stable due to the high symmetry of the icosahedral structure",
    ", we found an additional subphase :    * * ac * ( adsorbed icosahedral compact conformations ) : like dc , but polymers typically are in touch with the surface .",
    "as a clear individual subphase only observed for @xmath104 .",
    "the transition lines in the pseudophase diagram ( figure [ fig:4 ] ) represent the best compromise of all quantities analyzed separately in our study . only in the thermodynamic limit of infinitely long chains",
    "are most of the identified pseudophase transitions expected to occur at sharp values of the parameters @xmath28 and @xmath34 for all observables . for finitely long chains",
    ", the transition lines still vary with chain length @xmath16 and are not well defined due to the broad peaks that are slightly different for different observables ( see figure [ fig:6 ] ) . taking that into account",
    ", the pseudophase diagram gives a good qualitative overview of the behavior of polymers near attractive substrates in dependence of environmental parameters such as solvent quality and temperature .",
    "the locations of the phase boundaries should be considered as rough guidelines .",
    "( a ) temperature dependence of several observables for @xmath130 and @xmath100 .",
    "( b ) the derivative with respect to @xmath34 of the same quantities.,width=328 ]",
    "finally , we would like to compare our results discussed here with those obtained from a similar model on a simple - cubic ( sc ) lattice  @xcite .",
    "the lattice polymer is modeled as a nongrafted interacting self - avoiding walk confined between two infinitely extended parallel planar walls .",
    "one wall is short - range attractive , and the other is purely sterical and prevents the polymer from escaping .",
    "the energy of the system is given by @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the number of nearest - neighbor monomer - substrate contacts , @xmath133 is the number of nearest - neighbor but nonadjacent monomer - monomer contacts , and @xmath134 and @xmath135 are the respective contact energy scales . in refs @xcite and",
    "@xcite the contact density @xmath136 was directly sampled by means of the contact - density chain - growth method , which is an extension of the multicanonical chain - growth method  @xcite .",
    "the pseudophase diagram , parameterized by temperature and monomer - monomer interaction strengh was discussed mainly using the specific - heat profile . for a review see ref @xcite .",
    "the surface - monomer attraction strength was fixed . with the contact density",
    ", the specific - heat profile can be calculated for fixed monomer - monomer interaction @xmath137 , while varying the surface attraction parameter @xmath134 as it was done in the present off - lattice study .",
    "the resulting pseudophase diagram is depicted for a 179mer in figure [ fig : pd179 ] , where the parametrization chosen in ref @xcite was rescaled in order to allow for a more direct comparison with the results of our off - lattice study . denoting the energy and temperature from ref @xcite with @xmath138 and @xmath139 ,",
    "respectively , the rescaling works as follows :    @xmath140    here , @xmath141 is the ratio of energy scales of intrinsic and surface contacts as introduced in ref @xcite .",
    "it can be interpreted as a reciprocal solvent - quality parameter .",
    "pseudophase diagram of a lattice polymer with 179 monomers@xcite , parametrized by the surface attraction strength , @xmath134 , and temperature , @xmath34 .",
    "the color encodes the specific - heat profile ; the darker the color , the larger its value . ]",
    "certain similarities between the off - lattice ( figure [ fig:4 ] ) and the lattice pseudophase diagram ( figure [ fig : pd179 ] ) are obvious .",
    "for instance , the adsorption transition line is parametrized in both models by @xmath119 .",
    "different , however , is not only the slope , which depends on the system s geometry and energy scales , but also for the off - lattice model the extrapolation of the transition line seems to go through the origin @xmath142 and @xmath143 , whereas there is an offset observed in the lattice - system analsis such that the extrapolated transition line roughly crosses @xmath144 and @xmath143 . we speculate that this might be due to the intrinsic cuboidal structure of the polymer conformation on the sc lattice that possess planar surfaces at low temperatures even in bulk . unlike for off - lattice models , where a compact polymer attains a spherical shape , such a cuboidal conformation is likely to dock at a substrate without substantial conformational rearrangements . here lies an important difference between lattice and off - lattice models .",
    "the off - lattice model provides , for sufficiently small surface attraction strengths , a competition between most compact spherical conformations that do not possess planar regions on the polymer surface and less compact conformations with planar regions that allow for more surface contacts but reduce the number of intrinsic contacts .",
    "this also explains why a transition like the one observed for @xmath104 between ac and ac2a , the wetting transition , is more difficult to observe in adsorption studies on regular lattices . on the other hand , ac2 conformations at low @xmath34 and for @xmath28 between the adsorption and the single - double layering transitions",
    "can be observed in both models .",
    "similarly in both models , there exists the ag pseudophase of surface - attached globules .",
    "whereas for the off - lattice model , apart from the wetting transition , there is only the transition from ac2a ( semispherically shaped ) to ac2b ( double - layer structures ) , on the lattice ac2 comprises of a zoo of subphase transitions .",
    "these are higher - order layering transitions . decreasing the surface attraction at low temperature , layer after layer",
    "is added until the number of layers is the same as in the most compact conformation .",
    "a lattice polymer has no other choice than forming layers in this regime .",
    "the layering transition from ac1 to ac2 is very sharp in both models .",
    "also the shape of the transition region from topologically 2d adsorbed to 3d adsorbed conformations looks very similar .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath145-ratio predicted for this transition in ref @xcite agrees quite well with that observed in our off - lattice study . for low - energy conformations ,",
    "it is argued that @xmath146 on the square lattice . with @xmath147 and @xmath148",
    "this gives @xmath149 for the single- to double - layer transition , which is confirmed by fig .",
    "[ fig : pd179 ] .",
    "we re - expressed this argument for a triangular lattice , which describes the low - temperature conformations of our off - lattice model better , and obtain @xmath150 for low - energy configurations .",
    "this yields the larger ratio @xmath151 for @xmath33 , which is due to the higher coordination number of this geometry .",
    "it is in good agreement with our simulation results for this transition .",
    "the higher coordination number also causes the different slopes of the respective adsorption transitions .    to summarize , we conclude that , in particular , the high - temperature pseudophases , de , dc / dg , ag , and ae , nicely correspond to each other in both models .",
    "noticeable qualitative deviations occur , as expected , in those regions of the pseudophase diagram where compact conformations are dominant .",
    "in this paper , we have constructed the pseudophase diagram of thermodynamic conformational phases of a single semiflexible homopolymer near an attractive substrate in dependence of the external parameters surface attraction strength and temperature .    for two polymer chains with @xmath104 and @xmath100 monomers , respectively , the canonical expectation values of several energetical and structural quantities and their thermal fluctuations were measured in multicanonical computer simulations over a broad range of surface attraction strengths and temperatures .",
    "conformational phases and phase boundaries and their location in the pseudophase diagram were identified in precise analyses of structural fluctuations and suitable adsorption parameters .",
    "although the computational expense to accurately explore such a broad parameter range restricted us to investigate rather short chains , we identified the following conformational pseudophases and pseudophase transitions :    * crystalline structures in the regimes of compact phases .",
    "we identified maximally compact desorbed conformations in bulk ( dc ) or adsorbed at the substrate ( ac ) , semispherical compact conformations ( ac2a ) that are distorted by the surface but not layered , double - layer conformation ( ac2b ) , and single - layer conformations ( ac1 ) .",
    "* adsorbed conformations in the globular and expanded ( random - coil ) phases . here ,",
    "three conformational pseudophases were distinguished : unstructured 3d surface - attached globular conformations ( ag ) , expanded dissolved but planar adsorbed conformations ( ae1 ) , and 3d expanded random - coil - like adsorbed conformations ( ae2 ) . * desorbed conformations .",
    "compact conformations ( dc ) are separated by the freezing transition from globular conformations ( dg ) . at even higher temperatures above the @xmath0-transition ,",
    "random - coil conformations are found ( de ) .",
    "the sharpest pseudophase transition identified is the layering transition between single- and double - layer - structures .",
    "higher - layer conformations were not found for these short chains .",
    "unlike in recent studies on a simple - cubic lattice , where for weak surface attraction and positive self - attraction , layering transitions were observed until a maximally compact cubic structure is reached , off - lattice polymers favor maximally compact spherical conformation .",
    "thus , we find the expected differences in the behavior of off - lattice and lattice polymers in phases , where compact adsorbed conformations dominate . for the majority of pseudophases , in particular those that are assumed to be relevant in the thermodynamic limit , we find , however , a nice qualitative coincidence .",
    "this similarity demonstrates the ability of such simple coarse - grained models to capture the general adsorption behavior of polymers near attractive surfaces .",
    "the increasing experimental and technological capabilities should allow not only for the experimental verification of the described thermodynamic phases but also for a detection of the pseudophases of finite polymers . since polymers are naturally of finite length , this problem is one of real physical interest .",
