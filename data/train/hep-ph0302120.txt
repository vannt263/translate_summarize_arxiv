    "in the standard model ( sm ) @xcite of particle physics , there are three types of interactions of fundamental particles : gauge interactions , yukawa interactions and the higgs boson self - interaction .",
    "the higgs boson @xcite plays an important role in the sm ; it is responsible for generating the masses of all the elementary particles ( leptons , quarks , and gauge bosons ) .",
    "however , the higgs - boson sector is the least tested one in the sm , in particular the higgs boson self - interaction . in the sm , the profile of the higgs particle is uniquely determined once its mass @xmath6 is fixed .",
    "the decay width , the branching ratios and the production cross sections are given by the strength of the yukawa couplings to fermions and gauge bosons , the scale of which is set by the masses of these particles . unfortunately , the mass higgs boson is a free parameter .",
    "the only available information on @xmath6 is the lower limit @xmath7 @xmath4 established at lep2 @xcite .",
    "the collaborations have also reported a 2.1@xmath8 excess of events beyond the expected sm backgrounds consistent with a sm like higgs boson with a mass @xmath9 @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the accuracy of the electroweak data measured at lep , slc , and the tevatron provides sensitivity to @xmath6 : the higgs boson contributes logarithmically , @xmath10 , to the radiative corrections to the @xmath11 boson propagators . a recent analysis yields the value @xmath12 @xmath4 corresponding to 95@xmath13 c.l .",
    "the search for higgs boson is one of the main missions of present and future high - energy colliders .",
    "the observation of this particle is of major importance for the present understanding of the interactions of the fundamental particles .",
    "the trilinear higgs self - coupling can be measured directly in pair - production of higgs particles at hadron and high - energy @xmath14 linear colliders .",
    "higgs pairs can be produced through double higgs - strahlung of @xmath15 or @xmath16 bosons @xcite , @xmath17 or @xmath18 fusion @xcite ; moreover through gluon - gluon fusion in @xmath19 collisions @xcite and high - energy @xmath20 fusion @xcite at photon colliders .",
    "the two main processes at @xmath14 colliders are double higgs - strahlung and @xmath17 fusion :    @xmath21    the @xmath18 fusion process of higgs pairs is suppressed by an order of magnitude since the electron - z coupling is small .",
    "however , the process @xmath22 has been extensively studied .",
    "this three - body process is important because it is sensitive to yukawa couplings . the inclusion of four - body processes with heavy fermions @xmath23 , @xmath24 @xcite in which the sm higgs boson is radiated by a @xmath25 quark , at future @xmath0 colliders @xcite with a c.m .",
    "energy in the range of 500 to 1600 @xmath4 , such as the tesla machine @xcite is necessary in order to know its impact on the three - body mode processes and also to search for new relations that could have a clear signature of the higgs boson production .",
    "moreover , this process depends on the higgs boson triple self - coupling , which could lead us to obtain the first non - trivial information on the higgs potential .",
    "we are interested in finding regions that could allow the observation of the process @xmath2 at the next generation of high energy @xmath0 linear colliders .",
    "we consider the complete set of feynman diagrams at tree - level ( fig.1 ) and used the calchep @xcite packages for the evaluation of the amplitudes and of the cross section .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we present the total cross section for the process @xmath1 at next generation linear @xmath0 colliders , and in sec .",
    "iii , we give our conclusions .",
    "in this paper , we evaluate the total cross section of the higgs pair - production in the sm at next generation linear @xmath0 colliders .    for the sm parameters , we have adopted the following : the angle of weinber @xmath26 , the mass ( @xmath27 @xmath4 ) of the top",
    ", the mass ( @xmath28 @xmath4 ) of the @xmath29 , with the mass @xmath6 of the higgs boson having been taken as inputs @xcite .",
    "we have considered the high energy stage of a possible next linear @xmath0 collider with @xmath30 @xmath4 and design luminosity 1000 @xmath5 . in the evaluation of the amplitudes and of the cross section",
    ", we used the calchep @xcite packages .    in order to illustrate our results of the production of higgs pairs in the sm , we present in fig .",
    "2 a plot for the total cross section as a function of higgs boson mass @xmath31 . we observe in this figure that the total cross section for the double higgs production is of the order of @xmath32 @xmath33 for higgs masses in the lower part of the intermediate range .",
    "the cross sections are at the level of a fraction of femtobarn , and they quickly drop as they approach the kinematic limit . in these conditions , it would be very difficult to extract any useful information about the higgs self - coupling from the studied process except that the @xmath14 machine works with very high luminosity .",
    "3 shows the total cross section as a function of the center - of - mass energy @xmath34 for two representative values of the higgs mass @xmath35 @xmath4 .",
    "we observe that the cross section is very sensitive to the higgs boson mass and decreases when @xmath6 increases .",
    "our conclusion is that for an intermediate higgs boson , a visible number of events would be produced , as is illustrated in table i.    for center - of - mass energies of 800 - 1600 @xmath4 and high luminosity , the possibility of observing the process @xmath2 is promising as shown in table i.    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     table i. total production of higgs pairs in the sm for @xmath36 @xmath5 and @xmath27 @xmath4 .",
    "we also include in fig .",
    "4 a contours plot for the number of events of the studied process , as a function of @xmath6 and @xmath34 .",
    "in conclusion , the double higgs production in association with @xmath25 quarks ( @xmath1 ) will be observable at the next generation linear @xmath14 colliders .",
    "the study of this process is important in order to know their impact on the 3-body process and it could be useful to probe anomalous @xmath37 coupling given the following conditions : very high luminosity , center - of - mass large energy and intermediate range higgs mass .",
