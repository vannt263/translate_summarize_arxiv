    "consider the incompressible navier - stokes equations @xmath0    here @xmath1 is the velocity field defined on the cylinder @xmath2 $ ] ( @xmath3 for @xmath4 ) , subject to the incompressibility constraint , while @xmath5 is the pressure and plays the role of a lagrange multiplier , and @xmath6 is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid .",
    "we consider no slip , or periodic boundary conditions when the domains allow it .",
    "for no slip boundary conditions we will mostly consider the case @xmath7 the variables @xmath8 are sometimes called _ primitive variables _ and the accurate approximation of both these variables is desirable in numerical simulations .    a typical approach for solving numerically convection - diffusion problems is to treat convection and diffusion separately ,",
    "the diffusion with an implicit approach and the convection with an explicit integrator , see for example @xcite .",
    "we will refer to these methods as _ implicit - explicit _ methods ( imex ) .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that most of the spatial discretizations of the diffusion operator give rise to finite dimensional counterparts which are symmetric and positive definite , so the implicit integration of the diffusion requires only the solution of symmetric positive definite linear algebraic systems .    in this paper",
    "we propose high order semi - lagrangian discretization methods in time , to be used in combination with high order spatial discretizations of the navier - stokes equations , as for example spectral element methods .",
    "high order methods are particularly interesting when highly accurate numerical approximations of a given flow are required .",
    "an interesting field of application is the direct numerical simulation of turbulence phenomena , as pointed out for example in @xcite .",
    "another relevant situation is in connection with discontinuous - galerkin methods , as an alternative to the use of explicit runge - kutta schemes . in this context",
    ", the purpose is to alleviate severe time - step restrictions imposed by cfl conditions .",
    "see for example @xcite for the use of imex time - stepping schemes combined with discontinuous - galerkin space discretizations , and @xcite for semi - lagrangian discontinuous galerkin methods .",
    "the integration methods we propose in this paper are implicit - explicit exponential integrators of runge - kutta type .",
    "they combine the use of a _ diagonally implicit runge - kutta _ method ( dirk ) for the diffusion with a _ commutator - free exponential integrator _ ( cf ) for the convection , and were denoted dirk - cf in @xcite .",
    "in addition to being implicit - explicit , because of the presence of exponentials of the linearized convection , the methods are amenable for semi - lagrangian implementations providing improved performance in convection - dominated problems . in the present paper",
    "we extend the approach of @xcite to the incompressible navier - stokes equations and we assess the performance of the obtained semi - lagrangian schemes .    to clarify the connection between semi - lagrangian methods and exponential integrators , let us consider the simple linear convection - diffusion model problem @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the total derivative of @xmath11 , with @xmath12 the convecting vector field .",
    "semi - lagrangian methods for convection - diffusion problems are usually formulated by applying a time - discretization directly to the time - dependent pde problem before any space discretization is performed .",
    "a simple example of a semi - lagrangian scheme is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the solution of @xmath15 this amounts to discretize the total derivative with forward euler and the diffusion with backward euler .",
    "finally the space discretization is introduced .",
    "the practical realization of this method requires :    * introducing a space discretization , where @xmath16 is a vector representing the numerical solution at time @xmath17 and on all nodes of the discretization grid @xmath18 ( or @xmath19 belonging to a suitable finite element space ) ; * a discretization of the laplacian ; * an operator @xmath20 interpolating @xmath19 on the domain @xmath21 ; * a suitable integration method to solve the equation @xmath22 and compute the characteristic paths ; we denote by @xmath23 its numerical flow at time @xmath24 and with initial value @xmath25 .",
    "so the fully discrete method can be expressed in the form @xmath26    our approach is to formulate the semi - lagrangian methods as time - integrators of appropriate semi - discrete pde problems . for this purpose",
    ", we assume that there exists a discrete convection operator @xmath27 ( in matrix form ) , such that @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the matrix - exponential , and @xmath30 is a discrete version of @xmath31 and is typically known only on the nodes of the discretization grid @xmath18 . based on this assumption",
    "the semi - lagrangian method can be also written in the form @xmath32    this corresponds to the time - integration of a system of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) of the type @xmath33 with an exponential integrator . as a result",
    "the semi - lagrangian methods of @xcite can be conveniently formulated as exponential integrators for a semi - discrete convection - diffusion problems of the type and ( nonlinear variants of ) . described above will never be used explicitly in the implementation of the semi - lagrangian methods , and the exponentials of @xmath34 will be obtained computing characteristics . with abuse of notation",
    ", we will also denote by @xmath34 the semi - discrete convection operator based on spectral element space - discretizations , which will be used for comparison methods based on classical ( eulerian ) imex time - integration . ]    in the case of pure convection problems a well known estimate , due to falcone and ferretti @xcite , gives a bound for the local error @xmath35 of the type @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a generic grid - point and @xmath38 is time . in this estimate ,",
    "the term @xmath39 is the error due to the numerical approximation of the characteristics paths , the term @xmath40 arises from the accumulation of the interpolation error , and @xmath41 is a constant independent of @xmath24 and @xmath42 .",
    "this estimate of the error suggests that the spatial error is affected positively by the use of large time - steps @xmath24 , moreover , when high order interpolation is used ( like in the case of high order spectral element methods ) , the integration of the characteristic paths should also be done at high accuracy and in particular an optimal @xmath24 could be chosen so that @xmath43 this motivates the interest in designing semi - lagrangian methods achieving high order in time , when the adopted space - discretization is of high order . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "we considered high order space discretizations by spectral element methods for convection - diffusion problems and provided high order semi - lagrangian time - discretizations for nonlinear convection - diffusion problems .",
    "we also showed numerically that the proposed integrators do overcome nominal cfl stability restrictions .    so far the case of linear and nonlinear convection - diffusion equations have been considered .",
    "semi - discretizations of the navier - stokes equations , giving rise to index 2 differential - algebraic systems , have been approached successfully by bdf - like multi - step methods proposed in @xcite .",
    "the connections of these methods to the methods proposed in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , have also been explained .",
    "here we address the case of semi - lagrangian methods based on one - step formulae , and more precisely runge - kutta type formulae . given a time - stepping technique , a standard approach to adapt the method to the incompressible navier - stokes equations is by means of projections .",
    "the primary example of this technique , and most famous projection method for the incompressible navier - stokes equations is the chorin s projection method , proposed by chorin @xcite and tmam @xcite .",
    "as for the usual formulation of semi - lagrangian methods , this and similar projection methods are also typically formulated by applying a time - discretization directly to the time - dependent pde problem before any space discretization is performed .",
    "the methods appear as splitting methods , where solutions of unconstrained problems and poisson equations for the pressure are handled separately and composed .",
    "the study of the temporal order of the chorin s projection method was considered in @xcite and @xcite and it revealed order 1 in time for the velocity and only @xmath44 for the pressure .",
    "such loss of order in time for the pressure has been analysed for projection methods for stokes and navier - stokes equations , @xcite , and there are various ways to add correction terms and restore the full order .",
    "we instead choose a different strategy .",
    "we first semi - discretize in space , taking care of boundary conditions , and then apply the exponential integrators and perform projections at the space - discrete level . to define the appropriate semi - discretization of the convection",
    ", we make use of the assumption .",
    "we start with a time - dependent spectral element space - representation of the numerical solution taking care of boundary conditions .",
    "the space - discrete numerical approximations of the navier - stokes velocity and pressure solve a system of index 2 algebraic equations with linear constraints .",
    "these semi - discrete equations are described by the usual semi - discrete divergence operator , a corresponding lagrangian multiplier representing the discrete pressure , and the usual discretization of the linear diffusion operator .",
    "the discrete nonlinear convection @xmath45 is assumed to have the property that for any two approximations of the numerical solution @xmath46 and @xmath19 , holds with @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "we then eliminate the lagrangian multiplier from the discrete equations and apply the semi - lagrangian exponential integrators to the resulting system of unconstrained ordinary differential equations , ensuring incompressibility in two different ways described in .",
    "the numerical approximation of the pressure is obtained in a post - processing step .    in",
    "we discuss various projection techniques for runge - kutta splitting methods ( imex and semi - lagrangian methods ) applied to the navier - stokes equations , to motivate our approach .",
    "in we present our schemes and show how to obtain high order implicit - explicit and semi - lagrangian methods for the incompressible navier - stokes equations .",
    "is devoted to the description of the implementation details . in this section",
    "we describe how we use techniques from @xcite for the efficient solution of the linear algebraic systems .",
    "we obtain an overall strategy which resembles conventional projection schemes as described in @xcite , where , at each step in time , one only needs to solve a sequence of decoupled elliptic equations for the velocity and the pressure . in",
    "we report the numerical experiments .",
    "we provide numerical verification of the temporal order of the methods , and we demonstrate the clear benefits of the proposed semi - lagrangian methods in the case of convection - dominated problems .",
    "since the pressure in the navier - stokes equations is not a dynamic variable , but plays the role of a lagrangian multiplier , a usual approach to time integration of the equations is by differentiating the constraints with respect to time until a differential equation for @xmath49 is obtained .",
    "another option is that of eliminating @xmath49 from the equation .",
    "this can be done by taking the divergence of the equation ( equivalent to differentiating once with respect to time ) . this way we obtain a poisson equation for the pressure @xmath50 with boundary conditions to be deduced from @xmath51 in particular , when @xmath52 is space - periodic , the pressure @xmath49 is fully defined in terms of the velocity field @xmath52 and the periodicity condition . in the case of no slip boundary conditions , taking the inner product of with the unit normal @xmath53 gives the neumann boundary conditions : @xmath54",
    "these can be used to solve the poisson equation for @xmath49 and fully determine the pressure . in both cases",
    "we can write @xmath55 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "ii ) ) . we can then eliminate the pressure from and obtain @xmath56    at this point , contains only dynamic variables and time integration methods can be applied in a usual way .",
    "we want to discuss the use of a time integration method on this equation and the preservation of incompressibility under time discretization .",
    "suppose we apply a classical runge - kutta method to this equation , without assuming any discretization in space .",
    "provided the initial value is divergence - free , since the update of a runge - kutta method is always of the form @xmath57 where @xmath58 for @xmath59 are the weights of the runge - kutta method , and @xmath60 and since @xmath61 , then @xmath62 is also divergence - free .",
    "the order of the numerical approximation of the velocity in time is the order of the runge - kutta method ( see @xcite for a similar conclusion ) .",
    "an approximation for the pressure of the same order can be obtained by @xmath63 , i.e. solving with @xmath64 inserted at the right hand side and with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "this approach gives high order divergence - free approximations of the velocity , but it lacks flexibility because convection and diffusion are treated with the same runge - kutta method , either an explicit or an implicit one . on one hand",
    "the use of explicit runge - kutta methods usually leads to severe step - size restrictions due to the presence of the laplace operator , but on the other hand the use of implicit methods involves the solution of a large nonlinear system of equations at each step .",
    "a more popular approach is therefore to treat convection explicitly and diffusion implicitly by a splitting and composition method or , alternatively , by a so called imex method .",
    "if we use a splitting and composition method to solve numerically , then we need to make sure that the individual flows which are composed are divergence - free in order for the final approximation to have the same property .",
    "suppose we can write @xmath65 such that we can split the right hand side of into two divergence - free parts @xmath66 if we then solve individually each of the two split parts ( either exactly or by applying a method guaranteeing the incompressibility of the respective numerical approximations ) , then also the composition of the two numerical flows will be incompressible .",
    "the two terms @xmath67 and @xmath68 arise as solutions of two corresponding poisson problems imposing appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "a difficulty when performing such a splitting of the pde is that these boundary conditions should be consistent with those imposed for @xmath69 in , and such that the two individual problems @xmath70 with @xmath71 in admit solutions . in the next sections we deal with this issue by first discretizing in space - with a spectral element discretization ,",
    "then eliminating the discrete pressure lagrangian multiplier and finally applying the integration methods to the discrete analog of @xmath72 see section  [ semid_proj : sec ] .",
    "the situation for semi - lagrangian and imex methods is similar to what happens with splitting methods .",
    "we clarify this analogy in two simple examples .",
    "semi - lagrangian methods can be seen in some cases as splitting methods .",
    "if we consider the reformulation of using the total derivative we obtain @xmath73 and a semi - lagrangian method is based on the direct approximation of the total derivative along characteristics .",
    "so for example using a simple forward euler scheme we get @xmath74 where @xmath75 are the characteristic paths , and the convecting vector field is @xmath76 .",
    "now @xmath77 is the solution at time @xmath78 of the pure convection problem @xmath79 and @xmath80 is not necessarily divergence - free even if @xmath81 .",
    "the given semi - lagrangian method is evidently a splitting and composition method where we compose two numerical flows which are not divergence - free , then we can not expect @xmath64 to be divergence - free . in section  [ dirkcfprojns : sec ]",
    "we consider splitting the discrete counterpart of the navier - stokes equations in the form , and we apply different methods to the discrete versions of , with this strategy we obtain an adaptation of the dirk - cf methods of @xcite to the navier - stokes equations .",
    "the situation is similar for imex methods .",
    "the simplest imex method is obtained by combining the forward euler and backward euler method and it is also a splitting method . advancing the numerical solution of by first applying a forward euler step to the convection , and then a backward euler step to the diffusion and the term @xmath69 , we get @xmath82 and with @xmath83 the approximation is of order 1 in time , both for the pressure and for the velocity , but @xmath84 .",
    "if we instead use the method on then we obtain @xmath85 in this case @xmath64 is a sum of three divergence - free terms and is therefore divergence - free .",
    "this method has order 1 for the velocity , and with @xmath83 we also get an order 1 approximation for the pressure",
    ". we will pursue this strategy for imex methods in the next sections .",
    "we want to emphasize the difference between this approach and the chorin s projection method which consists of two steps : an update step @xmath86 and the projection step @xmath87 guaranteeing incompressibility of @xmath64 ( and we omitted boundary conditions for @xmath88 for simplicity ) . in the chorin s projection method",
    "one poisson problem for the pressure is solved in . in this case",
    "the pressure update @xmath88 does not satisfy with @xmath64 inserted at the right hand side . as shown in @xcite",
    ", @xmath88 is an approximation of order @xmath44 for the pressure .",
    "we finally remark that given a differential equation whose solution is evolving on a manifold , a simple approach to obtain a numerical approximation of high order evolving on the manifold is by applying any one - step integrator to the problem , and then performing an appropaiate projection on the manifold ( see ( * ? ? ? *",
    "iv.4 ) , see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sect.5.3.3 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sect.vii.2 ) ) . for the navier - stokes equations",
    "the solution is constrained to evolve on the linear subspace of divergence - free vector fields .",
    "so any integration method applied to giving an approximation of high order for the velocity , can be corrected at the end of each step by a suitable projection step to enforce the incompressibility constraint . a final post - processing step , projecting the right hand side of the equation evaluated at the obtained approximation of the velocity , leads finally to an approximation of the same order for the pressure .",
    "this approach will be pursued in section  [ projdirkcfns : sec ] .",
    "in this section we present the details of the high order integration schemes proposed in this paper .",
    "as outlined in the introduction and in the previous section we consider the spatial discretization of and proceed eliminating the lagrangian multiplier from the semi - discrete equations .",
    "after spatial discretizations of type spectral - galerkin or spectral element methods , we obtain a system of differential - algebraic equations of the type : @xmath89 here the matrix @xmath90 represents the discrete laplacian , @xmath91 is the discrete convection operator ; @xmath92 and @xmath93 are respectively the discrete divergence and gradient operators",
    ". meanwhile vectors @xmath94 and @xmath95 represent numerical approximations of the velocity @xmath52 and the pressure @xmath49 respectively . in the numerical experiments",
    "@xmath90 and @xmath92 are obtained by a spectral element method ( sem ) based on the standard galerkin weak formulation .    for @xmath91 we have two options . when the overall space - time discretization is of eulerian type , and we integrate in time with imex runge - kutta methods like ( see also [ section : imexdirkcf ] ) , then @xmath91 is assumed to be the semi - discrete convection operator based on the standard spectral element space - discretization . otherwise , when the overall space - time discretization is of semi - lagrangian type , and we integrate in time with dirk - cf exponential integrators like ( see also [ section : imexdirkcf ] ) , then @xmath91 is the discrete convection operator fulfilling , and @xmath96 is the natural , built - in interpolation operator of the sem method .    in the numerical experiments ,",
    "the approximation is done in @xmath97 compatible velocity - pressure discrete spaces .",
    "that is , in each element we approximate the velocity by a @xmath98-degree lagrange polynomial based on gauss - lobatto - legendre ( gll ) nodes in each spatial coordinate , and the pressure by @xmath99-degree lagrange polynomial based on gauss - legendre ( gl ) nodes .",
    "the discrete spaces are spanned by tensor product polynomial basis functions .",
    "a consequence of this choice of the spatial discretization is that the grid for the pressure does not include boundary nodes ( there are no boundary conditions for the pressure ) .",
    "we note that this is not the only viable choice of spatial discretization for our time - integration schemes , but , for the sake of clarity , we find it preferable to fix a concrete spatial discretization .",
    "we can eliminate the lagrangian multiplier @xmath95 from the system by multiplying on both sides by @xmath100 and using the constraint @xmath101 .",
    "this leads to the following system of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) @xmath102 where @xmath103 .",
    "we introduce the projection @xmath104 allowing to write the ode in the short form @xmath105      to begin with we apply the imex runge - kutta method to the system and we obtain an high order implicit - explicit eulerian approach for the incompressible navier - stokes equations .",
    "we assume that the considered imex methods are stiffly accurate , i.e. the last stage coincides with the update of the solution .",
    "this assumption is not strictly necessary , but since in this case the update @xmath106 coincides with the last stage value of the method @xmath107 , the format of the methods and the formulae are simpler .",
    "we obtain    @xmath108 @xmath109    see [ section : imexdirkcf ] for the definition of imex methods for convection - diffusion problems .",
    "the method requires the solution of one linear system per stage with the matrix @xmath110 this matrix is never formed explicitly in the implementation .",
    "instead the equation can be rearranged to obtain a method for the differential - algebraic equation and , denoting by @xmath111 , @xmath112 , we obtain @xmath113 we notice in particular that @xmath114 satisfies the discrete incompressibility constraint @xmath115 .    finally , to recover the correct approximation of the pressure at time @xmath38 we perform a post - processing step .",
    "we consider the right hand side of and evaluate it in @xmath106 obtaining an approximation to @xmath116 .",
    "since @xmath117 and @xmath118 the correct approximation of the pressure is given by @xmath119 such that @xmath120 and amounts to solving a linear system for @xmath121 obtained by multiplying by @xmath122 : @xmath123      in this section we present our first semi - lagrangian approach to the incompressible navier - stokes equations based on the exponential integrators methods of @xcite .",
