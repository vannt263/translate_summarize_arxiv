    "agile is a small scientific mission of the italian space agency dedicated to high - energy astrophysics ( tavani et al .",
    ". it will be the only mission entirely devoted to gamma - ray observations in the 30 mev-50 gev energy band , with simultaneous x - ray imaging also in the 10 - 40 kev band , during the period 2005 - 2007 . despite its small dimensions ( @xmath00.3 m@xmath1 ) and weight ( @xmath0100 kg ) compared to other future instruments such as glast",
    ", the agile performance will be as good as , or better than , that of bigger past instruments such as egret , thanks to the new silicon detector technology employed for the agile instruments .",
    "high - energy photons are converted into e@xmath2/e@xmath3 pairs in a tracker made of 12 silicon - tungsten planes , which allows us to efficiently collect photons with an effective area of @xmath0500 @xmath4 and to perform photon direction reconstruction with good angular resolution ( @xmath00.5@xmath5 , @xmath6@xmath01 gev ) ( figure 1 ) on a very large field of view , covering about 1/5 of the sky in a single pointing ( figure 3 ) .",
    "a mini - calorimeter made of cesium - iodide bars supports the tracker for photon energy reconstruction and particle background rejection , together with a set of anticoincidence scintillator panels surrounding 5 sides of the instrument .",
    "an additional silicon plane and a coded mask , positioned on top of the tracker , constitute superagile , an x - ray imager with angular resolution of @xmath01 - 3 arcmin and sensitivity of @xmath05 mcrab in the band 10 - 40 kev .",
    "agile is characterized by the smallest deadtime ever obtained for gamma - ray detection ( @xmath7200 @xmath8s ) and absolute time tagging with uncertainty near @xmath01 @xmath8s .",

    "among the @xmath01500 rotation - powered pulsars , observed mainly in the radio band , only 7 are seen as pulsed gamma - ray sources , and another @xmath010 have been reported as possible detections ( e.g. kanbach , 2002 ) .",
    "the availability of a wider and deeper sample of gamma - ray observations of pulsars could better constrain emission models that predict different beaming angles and directions for the radio and gamma - ray emission .",
    "agile will improve photon statistics for gamma - ray pulsation searches and will offer the first possibility , before the launch of glast ( michelson , 2001 ) , of detecting several young and energetic radio pulsars that have been discovered since the end of the cgro mission .",

    "dotted lines correspond to the extreme values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( excluding ms pulsars ) of the @xmath015 known and candidate gamma - ray pulsars ( filled squares ) .",
    "the `` gamma - ray pulsars region '' ( upper rhomboidal region ) includes @xmath0400 radio pulsars likely to be efficient high - energy photons emitters . in this region",
    "there are @xmath020 non - variable egret unidentified sources ( triangles ) coincident with one or more radio pulsars ( the total number of radio / gamma coincidences being @xmath040).,width=529,height=366 ]    except for the claimed detection of the millisecond pulsar j0218 + 4232 at high - energy gamma rays ( kuiper et al . 2000 , 2002 ) , all other known gamma - ray pulsars discovered by egret ( including low significance pulsed detections ) lie in the region of the @xmath11 diagram characterized by @xmath9@xmath12@xmath13 @xmath14 and @xmath10@xmath12@xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 ( figure 2 ) .",
    "radio pulsars in this region are natural gamma - ray pulsar candidates to be detected by instruments like agile with sensitivity slighly better than egret .",
    "it is worth noting that tens of them are within the error boxes of selected egret unidentified sources that do not show significant flux variations ( compared to blazars ) and are therefore good gamma - ray pulsar candidates .",
    "although many of these associations are expected to be chance coincidences , they represent top - ranked targets for pulsations searches with agile .",
    "the large field of view of agile allows simultaneous monitoring of many of these sources , and could cover the whole sky with only 6 pointings ( figure 3 ) .",
    "in particular , a single pointing at the galactic center region could include tens of nearby radio pulsars belonging to the `` gamma - ray pulsar region '' described in figure 2 , and @xmath050 unidentified egret sources possibly associated with radio - quiet pulsars , including those within the gould belt region ( gehrels et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "agile will continuously observe pulsars for long periods ( @xmath01 - 2 months ) avoiding typical timing analysis problems arising from merging many short observations at different times .",
    "a typical exposure on the galactic plane after two years of observations is @xmath02@xmath1810@xmath19 @xmath4 s for @xmath6@xmath12100 mev and the expected pulsar counts at these energies ( e.g. @xmath07000 cts from geminga and @xmath017000 from the vela pulsar ) are comparable or slighly better than the corresponding values for egret .",
    "the expected typical sensitivity after folding data at known pulsar periods is @xmath05@xmath1810@xmath20 ph/@xmath21 for @xmath6@xmath12100 mev .",
    "furthermore , using accurate radio ephemerides , it is possible to extract pulsar photons also in confused regions and exploit low energy data ( 20 - 100 mev ) for which angular resolution is poor but the agile effective area is still useful and better than that of egret ( figure 1 ) .",
    "in contrast to the relation valid at soft x - ray energies ( @xmath22 ) , the expected gamma - ray flux of radio pulsars is directly correlated to the goldreich - julian current and can be estimated according to the law @xmath23 ( kanbach , 2002 ) fitting egret pulsars well .",
    "the dispersion of the fit provides the min / max normalization values allowing a worst / best case approach for the gamma - ray fluxes estimates ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 in table 1 ) in the assumption that the gamma - ray beams intersect the line of sight . in this way it is possible to extract a subsample of radio - loud pulsars expected to be above the agile sensitivity threshold .",
    "up to @xmath0100 radio pulsars ( figure 3 ) could provide enough photons to be in principle observable by agile , the actual number of detections being dependent on the emission geometry .",
    "assuming , for example , gamma - ray emission cones of @xmath01 sr with random orientation respect to the radio beam , roughly @xmath010 sources of our sample should be detectable with agile .",
    "table 1 provides the first 35 top ranked radio - pulsars likely to have detectable fluxes ( @xmath24@xmath12@xmath26 @xmath27 ) even in the absence of coincidences with egret sources .",
    "it also includes ( lower part ) all the other weaker 11 radio - pulsars of the `` gamma - ray pulsar region '' coincident with egret unidentified sources and with expected fluxes near agile sensitivity .",
    "apart from the sources within the `` gamma - ray pulsar region '' , agile will have the first opportunity to explore the `` millisecond region '' of the @xmath11 diagram looking for peculiar gamma - ray emission from these objects and to confirm the claimed detection in high - energy gamma rays of psr j0218 + 4232 ( kuiper et al .",
    "2000 , 2002 ) .",
    "more detailed simulations of the population of gamma - ray pulsars , including deep statistical analysis of the emission geometry and beaming , predict very different numbers of radio - loud and radio - quiet pulsars detectable in gamma rays , strongly depending on the assumed model ( see e.g. gonthier et al .",
    "2001 ; mac laughlin and cordes , 2001 ) . extrapolating these results to the agile wide - band sensitivity",
    ", we expect to discover at least a dozen new objects .    100 known radio pulsars ( dots ) belonging to the `` gamma - ray pulsar region '' described in figure 2 and with maximum expected gamma - ray flux near agile sensitivity ( see text ) .",

    "pulsar spectra are generally curved in the gamma - ray band leading to a cut - off at a few gev and therefore very difficult to investigate with reasonable energy resolution ( @xmath42@xmath43@xmath44 ) due to the poor photon statistics available at these energies .",

    "1999 ) which can be explained with photon absorption by photon splitting in the scenario of polar cap models ( harding et al .",
    "1997 ) . for the competing scenario with outer gaps ,",
    "zhang and cheng ( 2000 ) offer an alternative explanation .",
    "there are now more than @xmath030 pulsars known with @xmath46 .",
    "these highly - magnetized pulsars represent a good opportunity for agile to perform a set of gamma - ray observations providing spectral break measurements in a more accessible energy range , possibly providing conclusive evidence for the signature of this exotic photon splitting process in the strongest magnetic fields of pulsars ."
