    "flat panel field emission displays have the potential to be a low cost , high performance alternative to the currently dominant cathode ray tube and liquid crystal displays .",
    "the first major problem in feds is the development of a reliable and efficient cold cathode electron emitter .",
    "current fed prototypes use sharp metal or semiconductor tips as field emitters  @xcite , that requires expensive lithography and other difficult fabrication processes . besides , the control voltage for such tip emitters is rather high ( about 100  v ) .",
    "some researchers use diamond - like films that contain nanoscale crystalline structure as the electron source  @xcite , or use diamond and other coatings of the sharp tips to improve the emission properties of the tips  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we propose another type of field emitter , where electrons are produced by an avalanche breakdown in the semiconductor near the edge of the top metal electrode in the mis structure .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in section  2 we describe the proposed display , based on the edge breakdown of the mis structure . in section  3",
    "we discuss the condition under which edge breakdown in the mis structure takes place . in section  4",
    "we estimate the influence of a neighboring electrode on the edge breakdown condition and in section  5 we discuss and summarize our results .",
    "in appendix we briefly estimate the influence of an electrode thickness on the edge breakdown condition .",
    "the display proposed is schematically shown in figure  1(a ) .",
    "glass substrate  1 with conductive metal column lines  2 is coated with a thin semiconductor layer  3 , which contains low p - doped column lines  4 that coincide with the metal ones .",
    "the film of the insulator with nea  5 is grown on semiconductor , and conductive metal row lines  6 are deposited on the insulator film . above the mis structure the fluorescent screen  7 is located .",
    "the anode ( fluorescent screen ) and cathode ( mis structure ) regions are separated by a vacuum space  8 .    when a positive voltage pulse of duration which is short compared to the time constant of thermal generation of minority carriers ( electrons in our case ) is applied to the top electrode of the mis structure , no inversion layer can form .",
    "thus , a large potential drop across the semiconductor will take place .",
    "if the amplitude of the pulse voltage is increased , band bending reaches large values where minority carriers are generated by nonthermal effects ( by avalanche in our case ) .",
    "the amplitude of the pulse voltage , at which avalanche occurs we designate by @xmath2 .",
    "when we apply a pulse voltage @xmath3 , which amplitude is less then @xmath2 , but more than @xmath4 to one row line , and simultaneously apply such a pulse voltage with another polarity to one column line , the avalanche breakdown in the semiconductor will take place at the intersection of these lines . under condition , which will be pointed out below , the breakdown will take place near the edges of metal lines .",
    "inasmuch as velocities of the avalanche electrons at the semiconductor - insulator interface are directed in an arbitrary way , it is clear that at least a portion of the avalanche electrons , ballistically passing through the thin film of the insulator , will be extracted with a good efficiency ( due to nea of the insulator ) into vacuum and will not impinge on the top metal layer .",
    "then this portion of electrons will be accelerated by screen voltage @xmath5 ( @xmath6  v ) and will be hit to the fluorescent screen as it is shown in figure  1(b ) .",
    "the deep - depletition breakdown of mos capacitors was first reported by goetsberger and nicollian  @xcite , who experimentally investigated doping conditions under which uniform avalanche takes place .",
    "later a `` universal and normalized '' criterion for `` field uniformity '' in mos capacitors was offered in the form @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 is the insulator thickness and @xmath9 is the maximum ( breakdown ) width of the semiconductor depletition region )  @xcite .",
    "this criterion was suggested in  @xcite based on computer - calculated values of the field distribution in mos capacitors .    in this section",
    "we obtain this criterion in an analytical form , with an emphasis on physical explanation of the result , that helps us to analyze operating conditions and an ultimate resolution of the display proposed .    for this purpose let us at first consider a simple two - dimensional model of the electric field near the edge of the metal plate ( see figure  2(a ) )",
    ". here @xmath10 and @xmath11 are conductive plates .",
    "let one plate have the potential @xmath12 , and the other plate have the zero potential .",
    "we will use a method of conformal transformations ( see  @xcite or any textbook in this field ) to find an electrical field distribution in such a system .",
    "the schwarz - chrisoffel transform @xmath13 \\label{1}\\ ] ] relates the upper half @xmath14 plane ( figure  2(b ) ) to the interior of the region @xmath15 of the @xmath16 plane ( figure  2(a ) )  @xcite .",
    "thus , half of the real axis @xmath17 is at potential @xmath12 while @xmath18 is at zero potential .",
    "the potential of the electric field in the @xmath14 plane is the real part of the complex potential given by the analytical function @xmath19 the electric field in the @xmath16 plane is @xmath20 performing the differentiation with respect to @xmath14 in  ( [ 1 ] ) and  ( [ 2 ] ) @xmath21 @xmath22 we get @xmath23    our main interest is the field near @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) . expanding logarithm in  ( [ 1 ] ) in a taylor series at @xmath25 and holding the first two terms , we obtain @xmath26 and from ( [ 6 ] ) we have @xmath27 or @xmath28 we may define @xmath29 as a `` critical '' distance from the edge at which field strength is still higher than @xmath30  the field strength between the plates far from the edge .    now",
    "the condition for edge breakdown is rather obvious : if insulator thickness is less than @xmath31 ( as is shown in figure  3 ) the breakdown takes place near the edge .",
    "but if @xmath32 the uniform breakdown occurs .",
    "the value @xmath33 in the real mis structure plays the role of the distance @xmath34 between the conductive plates in our model consideration .",
    "( the exception is the case when the distance @xmath35 ( see figure  1(b ) ) between the real metal plates is less than @xmath33 . in this case",
    "@xmath36 . ) from the equations @xmath37 @xmath38 we may obtain the criteria for the deep - depletition edge breakdown in terms of ratio of the insulator thickness to the maximum ( breakdown ) width of the semiconductor depletition region : @xmath39    one can see that the value obtained ( @xmath40 ) is consistent with the value @xmath41 obtained in the work  @xcite by numerical computer - aided calculations for particular system @xmath42 .",
    "the model considered is applicable to real systems subject to the condition that the radius of the edge curvature of the top electrode is less than insulator thickness .",
    "in this section we apply analogous approach to find breakdown condition for the system illustrated in figure  4(a ) .",
    "it is necessary for several reasons : first , one may like to initiate electron emission into a slit in the top electrode .",
    "second , it may be convenient to apply a voltage simultaneously to a set of neighboring row and column lines for more stable emission . and",
    "third , minimal distance between top electrodes defines the ultimate resolution of the proposed display .    the transformation @xmath43 \\label{13}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 relates the upper half @xmath14 plane ( figure  4(b ) ) to the interior of the region @xmath45 of the @xmath16 plane ( figure  4(a ) )  @xcite .",
    "thus , parts of the real axis @xmath46 and @xmath47 are at potential @xmath12 while part @xmath48 is at zero potential .",
    "the potential of the electric field in the @xmath14 plane is the real part of the complex potential given by the analytical function @xmath49 using the differentials with respect to @xmath14 of ( [ 13 ] ) @xmath50 and ( [ 15 ] ) @xmath51 we may find the electric field in the @xmath16 plane from ( [ 3 ] ) . @xmath52",
    "our concern is the field near @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) points .",
    "expanding arctanh and arctan in  ( [ 13 ] ) in a power series at @xmath55 and holding the first two terms , we have @xmath56^{1/3 } \\ ; . \\label{19}\\ ] ] and from ( [ 18 ] ) we have @xmath57^{1/3 } } \\ ; . \\label{20}\\ ] ] now the `` critical '' distance from the edge at which field strength is still higher than @xmath30 is @xmath58 one can see that this value is coincident with  ( [ 9 ] ) when @xmath59 .",
    "for example , if @xmath60 so @xmath61 is @xmath62 one can see that the distance @xmath63 between the top electrodes should be more than twice larger than @xmath64 to avoid drastic decrease of @xmath61 .",
    "firstly , let us mention the kind of insulator that may be used in this display .",
    "at least three kinds of insulators are appropriate for our purpose : hydrogen - terminated diamond  ( 111 ) , lif and @xmath65 .",
    "diamond has long attracted considerable attention as a cold cathode for fed due to its nea and robust mechanical and chemical properties .",
    "lif has the largest nea of any solid .",
    "the nea of lif crystal is @xmath66  ev  @xcite .",
    "the possibility of epitaxial grown of lif films on the ge was also reported in  @xcite .",
    "but we assume that the @xmath67 system is the best choice .",
    "the reasons for this are as follows :    1 .",
    "@xmath65 has a small but negative electron affinity  @xcite .",
    "2 .   a very attractive property of @xmath65 is similarity of its crystal structure to si : @xmath65 has cubic m3 m structure with only 0.6  % of lattice mismatch with si(111 ) at room temperature .",
    "this fact makes it possible to grow perfect single crystal films of @xmath65 on silicon by molecular beam epitaxy technique  @xcite . the crystalline quality , chemical stability and electrical characteristics of @xmath65 films grown on si(111 )",
    "may be further improved by rapid thermal annealing  @xcite .",
    "barrier height between the conductive band minimum of si and the conductive band minimum of @xmath65 is only @xmath68  ev  @xcite .",
    "an additional attractive property of @xmath65 is anomalously large low - energy electron escape depth of the order of 260  nm  @xcite .",
    "lastly , the good emission properties of the @xmath67 structure has recently been demonstrated in the experiment  @xcite .",
    "the thickness of the insulator film about @xmath69  nm seems to be nearly optimum because it is large enough to avoid direct tunneling of electrons from semiconductor to metal , but it is small enough for ballistic passing of electrons through insulator film .",
    "so , if one has 10  nm thick @xmath65 film on the @xmath70 m thick si layer with p - dopant concentration @xmath71@xmath72 ( @xmath73 m  @xcite ) , one may be sure that when pulse voltages with the amplitude @xmath74  v are applied to one row and one column lines an avalanche breakdown will occur at the edges of metal lines ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "the control voltage may be still decreased if the distance between metal electrodes @xmath35 will be less than @xmath33 ( but @xmath35 must always be more than @xmath76 ) .",
    "the avalanche electrons will be injected into insulator at the @xmath77 line , which shown in figure  3 . from geometrical considerations , up to several tens percent of electrons",
    "may be injected into vacuum .    to summarize ,",
    "we have proposed a simple design of the field - emission display based on the deep - depletition edge avalanche breakdown of the mis structure .",
    "the control voltage of this display may be as small as tens volts and its ultimate resolution may reach several microns .",
    "here we mention the influence of the top electrode thickness on the edge breakdown condition . to avoid complicated expressions ,",
    "we give only a simple estimation of the effect by solving the problem presented in figure  5(a ) , where top electrode has zero thickness .",
    "the equation @xmath78 relates the upper half @xmath14 plane ( figure  5(b ) ) to the interior of the region @xmath15 of the @xmath16 plane ( figure  5(a ) ) .",
    "the potential of the electric field in the @xmath14 plane is the real part of the complex potential given by the analytical function @xmath79 the electric field in the @xmath16 plane is @xmath80 performing the differentiation with respect to @xmath14 in  ( [ a1 ] ) and  ( [ a2 ] ) @xmath81 @xmath82 we get @xmath83    our main interest is the field near @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) . expanding logarithm in  ( [ a1 ] ) in a taylor series at @xmath25 and holding the first two terms , we obtain @xmath84 and from ( [ 6 ] ) we have @xmath85 one can see that the `` critical '' distance in this case is : @xmath86 and the edge breakdown condition is @xmath87 this edge breakdown condition should be used when top electrode thickness is less than any other dimensions in the system .",
    "essentially it means that top electrode thickness should be less than thickness of the insulator film .",
