    "double perovskites ( dp ) constitute a large family of materials @xcite with molecular formula a@xmath0bb@xmath1o@xmath2 , where a is an alkali or alkaline earth metal , and b and b@xmath1 are typically transition metals .",
    "although double perovskites have been studied for decades  @xcite , the discovery of high @xmath3 ferromagnetism and half - metallicity in sr@xmath0femoo@xmath2 has led to renewed interest in their properties .",
    "later , in a number of explorations it was discovered that these materials are candidates for various technological applications , _",
    "e.g. _ , in spintronics  @xcite ( sr@xmath0femoo@xmath2 ) , magneto - dielectrics  @xcite ( la@xmath0nimno@xmath2 ) , and magneto - optics  @xcite ( sr@xmath0croso@xmath2,sr@xmath0crreo@xmath2 ) .",
    "their properties are determined by the couplings on the b and b@xmath1 ions , the b and b@xmath1 valence state , and the structural order in the b - b@xmath1 lattice .",
    "the magnetism in the dp s arises from a combination of @xmath7 hund s coupling on the b , b@xmath1 ions and @xmath8 electron delocalisation . while there are important dp s where both b and b@xmath1 are magnetic ions , in the current work we will restrict ourselves to materials where only one ion , b , say , is magnetic .",
    "for example , in sr@xmath0femoo@xmath2 ( sfmo ) the b atom ( fe ) is magnetic while b@xmath1 ( mo ) is non magnetic@xcite . even in this restricted class , a large variety of compounds can be realized by taking @xmath9 , @xmath10 or @xmath11 transition metals as b and b@xmath1 , and alkaline earths or rare - earths as a. these lead to a variety of properties , _",
    "e.g. _ , high @xmath3 ferro(or ferri ) magnetism ( fm ) , with half - metallic@xcite or insulating @xcite behaviour .",
    "there have been several attempts at a theoretical understanding of the magnetism in these materials .",
    "these consist of ( i )  _ ab initio _ electronic structure calculations , and ( ii )  model hamiltonian based approaches .",
    "the _ ab initio _",
    "calculations@xcite provide material specific information about the electronic structure and allow a rough estimate@xcite of the @xmath3 .",
    "unfortunately , these calculations are rather complicated for non - collinear magnetic phases that are likely in a frustrated magnetic lattice , see fig.[b1b2 ] . in such situations model",
    "hamiltonian studies can provide some insight on possible ordered states .",
    "early model calculations for dp s used dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) to estimate @xmath3 and the magnetic stability window  @xcite , focusing on ferromagnetism . earlier work on the classical kondo lattice",
    "@xcite had revealed that variation in carrier density can lead to a wide variety of phases in a spin - fermion problem .",
    "indeed , calculation  @xcite in a two dimensional ( 2d ) model of dp s confirmed the existence of antiferromagnetic ( af ) , albeit collinear , phases .",
    "the ` frustrated ' character of the three dimensional ( 3d ) dp lattice raises the intriguing possibility of doping driven non collinear magnetic phases as well .",
    "our study aims to explore this issue in detail .",
    "our main results are the following . using a combination of monte carlo and variational minimization , we map out the magnetic ground state ( fig.[phdg1 ] ) at large hund s coupling for varying electron density and b - b@xmath1 level separation .",
    "in addition to fm , and collinear a and c type order , the phase diagram includes large regions of non - collinear ` flux ' and spiral phases and windows of phase separation .",
    "modest b@xmath1b@xmath1 hopping leads to significant shift in the phase boundaries , and `` particle - hole asymmetry '' .",
    "we provide estimates of the @xmath3 of these non trivial magnetic phases .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ modmeth ]",
    "we describe the model and methods , section  [ ph - sym - case ] describes our results in the particle - hole symmetric case ( @xmath12 ) , and section  [ ph - asym - case ] describes the effect of finite @xmath6 .",
    "section  [ discuss ] discusses some issues of modeling the real dp .",
    "section  [ conclude ] concludes the paper .",
    "previous study of double perovskites in two dimensions  @xcite revealed three collinear phases , namely fm , a diagonal stripe phase ( fm lines coupled antiferromagnetically ) and a ` g type ' phase ( up spin surrounded by down and _ vice versa _ ) . in 2d",
    "the b sub - lattice is square and bipartite , so there is no frustration . in a 3d _ simple cubic _",
    "b lattice the counterparts of the 2d phases would be fm , a type ( planar ) , c type ( line like ) and g type .",
    "the magnetic b ion lattice in the dp s is , however , fcc which is _ non - bipartite _ , so while one can construct fm and planar a type phases , the c type phase is modified and the g type phase can not exist .",
    "fig.[b1b2 ] briefly indicates why it is impossible to have an ` up'(@xmath13 ) b ion to be surrounded by only ` down'(@xmath14 ) b ions , _",
    "i.e. _ , the g type arrangement .",
    "two b neighbours of a b ion are also neighbours of each other , frustrating g type order .",
    "the suppression of the g type phase , which occupies a wide window in 2d , requires us to move beyond collinear phases in constructing the 3d phase diagram .",
    "we will discuss the variational family in section  [ varsch ] .",
    "the alternating arrangement of b and b@xmath1 ions in the ordered cubic double perovskites is shown in fig.[b1b2 ] .",
    "we use the following one band model on that structure : @xmath15    the @xmath16 correspond to the b ions and the @xmath17 to the b@xmath1 . @xmath18 and @xmath19 are ` onsite ' energy on the b and b@xmath1 sites respectively , _ e.g. _ , the @xmath20 level energy of fe and mo in sfmo .",
    "@xmath21 is the chemical potential and @xmath22 is the total electron number operator .",
    "@xmath23 is the hopping amplitude between nearest neighbour b and b@xmath1 ions .",
    "we augment this model later to study first neighbour b@xmath1b@xmath1 hopping @xmath6 as well .",
    "@xmath24 is the ( hund s ) coupling between the b core spin and the @xmath25 conduction electron .",
    "we will use @xmath26 , and absorb the magnitude of @xmath27 in @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath28 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the model has parameters @xmath24 , @xmath29 , @xmath19 , and @xmath21 ( or @xmath30 ) . since only the level difference matters",
    ", we set @xmath31 .",
    "we have set @xmath32 , and use @xmath33 so that the conduction electron spin at the b site is slaved to the core spin orientation .",
    "however , to keep the _ effective _ level difference between b and b@xmath1 sites finite we use the parameter @xmath34 , and explore the phases as a function of @xmath30 and @xmath35",
    ". we will present results for @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "a schematic for the levels is shown in fig.[vlabel ] .",
    "the structural unit cell of the system has 2 ( one b , one b@xmath1 ) atoms , which amounts to 4 atomic levels ( 2 up spin , 2 down spin ) .",
    "the two spin levels at the b site are separated by @xmath38 and overlap with 2 spin degenerate levels of the b@xmath1 site at @xmath39 .",
    "we take the large @xmath24 limit , and take @xmath40 with @xmath41 in the range ( 0 - 10 ) .",
    "one b band become centered at @xmath41 and second goes to @xmath42 .",
    "in this situation the down spin b and two b@xmath1 bands overlap while up spin b band is always empty .",
    "the relevant electron density window includes the lowest three bands , so our electron density will be in the range @xmath43 $ ] .    to get a general feel of the band structure of the particle hole symmetric case ,",
    "we notice that we have three levels ( excluding the highest @xmath44 level at @xmath45 which remains empty and is redundant for our purpose ) in atomic limit .",
    "these include one spin slaved @xmath46 level at @xmath47 , and the two @xmath48 , @xmath49 , levels which overlap with the @xmath46 levels depending on the spin configurations .",
    "this overlap leads to electron delocalisation and band formation .    for the fm , fig.[vlabel].(a ) , only one spin channel ( say @xmath49 ) gets to delocalise through @xmath25 sites and forms two bands , separated by a band gap of @xmath47 , while other spin channel ( say @xmath48 ) is localised at @xmath50 .    for collinear af configurations , fig.[vlabel].(b ) ,",
    "the conduction path gets divided into two sub - lattices , such that each spin channel gets to delocalise in one sub - lattice ( in which all the core spins point in same direction , making the sub - lattice ferromagnetic . ) see fig.[fig : spina ] , and fig.[fig : spinc ] for the details of the conduction path .",
    "in one such sub - lattice , only one of the @xmath13 or @xmath14 delocalised , the other remains localised .",
    "the roles of @xmath13 and @xmath14 are reversed in going from one sub - lattice to other , as a result one gets spin - degenerate localised and dispersive bands for af phases .    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the model involves spins and fermions , and if the spins are ` large ' , @xmath51 , they can be approximated as classical",
    ". this should be reasonable in materials like sfmo where @xmath52 . even in the classical limit",
    "these spins are annealed variables and their ground state or thermal fluctuations have to be accessed via iterative diagonalisation of the electronic hamiltonian .",
    "we use a ` traveling cluster ' monte carlo ( mc ) method where the cost of a spin update is estimated via a small cluster hamiltonian instead of diagonalising the whole system  @xcite .",
    "we typically use a @xmath53 system with the energy cost of a move estimated via a @xmath54 cluster built around the reference site .",
    "we principally track the magnetic structure factor @xmath55 where @xmath56 denote thermal average .",
    "althogh the magnetic lattice is fcc , the electrons delocalise on the combined b - b@xmath1 system which is a cubic lattice . hence we define our wave - numbers @xmath57 with respect to the full b - b@xmath1 lattice . as a result even a simple state like",
    "the ferromagnet corresponds to peaks at @xmath58 and @xmath59 and not just @xmath58 .",
    "this is because the spin field is also defined on b@xmath1 sites and it has to have zeros on these sites .",
    "this complication , and the possibility of spiral phases , _ etc _ , mean that ( i )  there are multiple @xmath57 values which could be significant at low temperature , and ( ii )  the @xmath60 peaks could be small even in the ordered state . combined with the intrinsic noise in mc data ( which is enhanced due to a complex energy landscape , discussed later ) it is sometimes difficult to identify complicated ordered phases .",
    "therefore , to complement the mc results we have also used the following variational scheme .",
    "we explore a set of magnetic states , comparing their energy to locate the minimum within that family for a fixed set of electronic parameters .",
    "we use : @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 with @xmath64 if @xmath65 and @xmath66 if @xmath67 .",
    "@xmath68 , _ etc .",
    "_ , are unit vectors in the corresponding directions .",
    "the vector field @xmath69 is characterized by the two wave - vectors @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "for a periodic configuration , these should be @xmath72 and @xmath73 , where @xmath74 s and @xmath75 s are integers , each of which take @xmath76 values in @xmath77 .",
    "there are @xmath78 ordered magnetic configurations possible , within this family , on a simple cubic lattice of linear dimension @xmath76 .    the use of symmetries , _",
    "e.g. _ , permuting components of @xmath79 , _ etc .",
    "_ , reduces the number of candidates somewhat , but they still scale as @xmath78 . for a general combination of @xmath80 the eigenvalues of h can not be analytically obtained because of the non trivial mixing of electronic momentum states .",
    "we have to resort to a real space diagonalisation .",
    "the hamiltonian matrix size is @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) and the diagonalization cost is @xmath83 .",
    "so , a comparison of energies based on real space diagonalisation costs @xmath84 , possible only for @xmath85 .",
    "we have adopted two strategies : ( i )  we have pushed this ` @xmath86 ' scheme to large sizes via a selection scheme described below , and ( ii )  for a few collinear configurations , where fourier transformation leads to a small matrix , we have compared energies on sizes @xmath87 .    first , scheme ( i ) . for @xmath88",
    "we compare the energies of all possible phases , to locate the optimal pair @xmath89 for each @xmath90 .",
    "we then consider a larger system with a set of states in the neighbourhood of @xmath89 .",
    "if we consider @xmath91 variation about each component of @xmath92 , _ etc _ , that involves @xmath93 states .",
    "the shortcoming of this method is that it explores only a restricted neighbourhood , dictated by the small size result .",
    "we have used @xmath94 within this scheme .",
    "the phases that emerge as a result of the above process are ( i ) ferromagnet ( fm ) , ( ii ) a - type , ( iii ) c - type , ( iv ) ` flux ' , and ( v ) three spirals sp@xmath95,sp@xmath0,sp@xmath96 .",
    "a - type is consists of ( @xmath97 ) fm planes with alternate planes having opposite spin orientation ( see fig.[fig : spina ] top panel ) . if we convert each of these planes to alternating fm lines , so that the overall spin texture is alternating fm _ lines _ in all directions , we get c - type phase ( see fig.[fig : spinc ] .    the ` flux ' phase is different from the spiral families described using period vectors @xmath98 .",
    "it is the augmented version of ` flux ' phase used in cubic lattice double exchange model by alonso _",
    "et al_@xcite(table - i ) . it has spin - ice like structure , and is described by @xmath99 the spiral sp@xmath100 phases are characterised by comensurate values of @xmath98 ( see table  [ tblsq ] for details of periods and the s(q ) peaks ) .",
    "the simplest , sp@xmath95 can be viewed as @xmath101-angle pitch in the @xmath102,@xmath103 and @xmath104 directions .",
    "the other two spirals sp@xmath0 sp@xmath96 are respectively c - type and a - type modulations upon sp@xmath95 .",
    "just as flipping alternate @xmath97 planes in a fm leads to the a type phase , flipping the spins in the @xmath105 planes alternatively in sp@xmath95 , leads to sp@xmath96 .",
    "analogously , flipping fm lines in a fm and leads to c - type order- and a similar exercise on sp@xmath95 leads to sp@xmath0 .",
    "this modulation is also seen in the @xmath60 peaks of sp@xmath0 and sp@xmath96 .",
    "see the table  [ tblsq ] , where all the three spirals have 4 s(*q * ) peaks common , and sp@xmath0 and sp@xmath96 possess extra s(*q * ) peaks of the a - type and c - type correlations .",
    "in scheme ( ii ) we take collinear phases from the phase diagram via monte - carlo and variational scheme  ( i ) , and compare them on very large lattices .",
    "this does not require real space diagonalisation .",
    "the simple periodicity of these phases leads to coupling between only a few @xmath106 states .",
    "the resulting small matrix can be diagonalized for the eigenvalues and these summed numerically .",
    "we also did it for the ` flux ' phase , where the resulting matrix is a bit larger , but still it gets us access to eigenvalues for the ` flux ' phase on large lattices .",
    "the details of this calculation are discussed in appendix  [ appdx ] . where the collinear phases ( and ` flux ' ) seem to dominate the phase diagram we compute phase boundaries by calculating the energy on very large lattices .",
    "the electrons move on the cubic lattice divided into two fcc sub - lattices each of which accommodate b and b@xmath1 sites . for each of these sub - lattice",
    ", one can define particle - hole transformation  @xcite for b and b@xmath1 sub - lattices as @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "this transforms the hamiltonian as @xmath109 .",
    "when @xmath12 , this simplifies to @xmath110 which reflects in the phase diagram as the repetition of the phases after half - filling . introducing the @xmath6 hopping destroys this symmetry , but a reduced symmetry still remains relating @xmath111 , which is reflected in the phase diagrams of particle - hole asymmetric case .",
    "we first discuss the case of particle - hole symmetry , _ i.e _",
    ", @xmath12 , and the case of @xmath112 in the next section . for each of these cases",
    "we first discuss the mc results since these are unbiased , though affected by finite size and the cluster update mechanism .",
    "this provides a feel for the relevant candidate states that we can explore more carefully within a variational scheme .",
    "it also provides an estimate of @xmath3 , not readily available within the variational scheme .    following this we show the ground states and phase separation ( ps ) windows that emerge from the variational calculation for varying @xmath30 and @xmath35 .",
    "we also provide an alternate estimate of the `` @xmath3 '' of these phases by calculating the energy difference @xmath113 , that the system gains via magnetic ordering . here",
    "@xmath114 is the electronic energy averaged over disordered ( paramagnetic ) spin configurations while @xmath115 is the energy of the magnetically ordered ground state , both at the same electron density @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath116 is the number of spins in the system .",
    "the phases that dominate the phase diagram are listed in table-[tblsq ] , with the associated @xmath98 , and the peak locations in the structure factor .",
    "we studied a @xmath117 system using the cluster based update scheme .",
    "we used a large but finite @xmath24 to avoid explicitly projecting out any electronic states  @xcite , since that complicates the hamiltonian matrix but allows only a small increase in system size .",
    "the magnetic phases were explored for @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "an illustrative plot of peak features in @xmath60 as function of temperature @xmath120 , is shown in fig.[sqplt1 ] for some typical densities , where , for fm , s(*q*@xmath121 ) shows monotonic decrease of t@xmath122 with increasing @xmath47 . for a - type and ` flux ' phase , the s(*q * ) data shows a number of sub - dominant * q * peaks whose number keeps increasing as we move to more complicated phases with increasing density .",
    "using the structure factor data , we establish the @xmath123 phase diagram for @xmath124 that is plotted in fig.[tc3del ] .",
    "the monte carlo captures mainly three collinear phases , namely fm , a - type , and a @xmath125 phase .",
    "the @xmath125 phase corresponds to two fm up planes followed by two fm down planes and so forth .",
    "as the carrier density is increased via increasing @xmath21 , we find a fm phase followed by the a - type af .",
    "a @xmath125 phase appears in a thin window surrounded by fm itself .",
    "we suspected that this as a finite size effect , and a comparison with the energy of the fm on larger lattices ( @xmath126 ) , shows that the fm is indeed the ground state in the thermodynamic limit , and so we consider fm and @xmath125 collectively as fm only , and presence of @xmath125 is not indicated in the phase diagram .",
    "the fm is stable at the ends of the density window , and its region of occurence is slowly enhanced as we increase @xmath41 , see fig.2 as well .",
    "the @xmath3 however decreases with increasing @xmath41 since the degree of b - b@xmath5 mixing ( and kinetic energy ) decreases .    with further increase in @xmath30 the 2d system",
    "is known to make a transition to a line - like phase , and then a ` g type ' phase ( up spin surrounded by down , etc ) . in 3d",
    "one would expect the fm to change to a ` planar ' ( a type ) phase , then a ` line like ' ( c type ) phase and finally to a g type phase if possible .",
    "all of these are of course collinear phases , and geometric constraints may lead to non - collinear order as well .",
    "while we do access the a type phase with some difficulty , our monte carlo can not access the long range ordered c type phase .",
    "however , we see clear evidence of c type correlations in the structure factor . comparing the energy of the ideal c type phase with the short range",
    "correlated phase that emerges from the mc we infer that such order is indeed preferred . however , we can not estimate a reliable @xmath3 scale . in the next section",
    "we will see that the variational calculation confirms the stability of the c type , among collinear phases , in this density window , and will get a rough estimate of the @xmath3 from the energy @xmath127 .",
    "the g type phase is geometrically disallowed on the b sub - lattice due to its fcc structure .",
    "an examination of the structure factor in the density window @xmath128 $ ] suggests ` flux ' like correlations at small @xmath47 which evolves into a spiral at larger @xmath47 .",
    "the frustration reduces the @xmath3 of the phases in this density window compared to that of the fm .",
    "we studied the situation in 2d , where the system is unfrustrated , and the numbers below highlight the impact of frustration . in 2d , monte carlo results yield @xmath129 , while in 3d @xmath130 .",
    "we had focused on af states at @xmath131 .",
    "if we compare the @xmath132 for 2d and 3d , the numbers come out to be @xmath133 and @xmath134 respectively  @xcite .",
    "the comparisons suggest a significant decrease in the binding energy ( and hence @xmath3 ) of the af phases relative to the fm as we move from 2d to 3d .",
    "when @xmath12 , the electron delocalisation happens through b - b@xmath1-b paths only ( see the conduction paths , for example of collinear phases a and c in fig.[fig : spina ]  and  [ fig : spinc ] respectively ) . in this cas",
    "all the phases have an atomic level located at @xmath135 in the limit @xmath136 .",
    "this is directly seen in the density of states ( dos ) of these phase . in fig.[dos1 ] we show the dos for the f , a , c , ` flux ' and paramagnet phases .",
    "this dispersion - less level gives constant @xmath3 in density region @xmath137 $ ] .",
    "this feature , and several others , are modified by finite b@xmath1b@xmath1 hopping , which leads to broadening of this level .",
    "it makes the dos of the various magnetic phases asymmetric ( in energy ) and also destroys the particle - hole symmetry in the phase diagram .      using the approach discussed earlier",
    ", we found the ground state configurations at different electron densities . in this set",
    "we also get certain spiral phases , which are small variations of fm , a , and c phases in the left and right part of the density window . since in these parts monte carlo also gives ( for fm , a ) clean result , we interpret it as a finite size effect . to get convinced about it , we compare the energies of these collinear phases ( fm , a , c ) with all their neighboring modulations @xmath138s , at various lattice sizes .",
    "we find that with increasing lattice size , the per particle energy difference between collinear phase , and lowest energy candidate with the neighboring @xmath70,@xmath139 , decreases , which convinces us that if we go to large enough lattice size , this difference will eventually vanish and the collinear phases ( f , a , c ) will be the relevant candidates .",
    "we use a similar scheme for the middle part , however there no simple phase is suggested by this variational scheme ( neither by monte carlo ) .",
    "the phases we propose for the middle density part based on this variational scheme are sp@xmath95 , sp@xmath0 , sp@xmath96 , and ` flux ' .",
    "see the configurations in fig.[spins_flsp ] and @xmath140 details from table  [ tblsq ] .    in fig.[phdg1 ] , the magnetic ground state is shown for @xmath12 and @xmath141 ( top and bottom ) .",
    "we see that for @xmath12 the phase diagram is symmetric in density . for small @xmath41 , in the range @xmath142",
    ", we have fm , followed by a - type , c - type , and ` flux ' phase .",
    "the order reverses as we go in the other half of the density window .",
    "the g - type phase which was largest stable phase in 2d ( fig.2 and fig.5 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) is almost taken over by the ` flux ' phase .",
    "the stability of the ` flux ' phase decreases with @xmath41 and it does not show up for @xmath143 .    in fig.[dos1 ] , we show the dos for f , a , c , ` flux ' and pm phases .",
    "the upper and the lower panel correspond to @xmath144 and @xmath145 respectively .",
    "in all the phases , at all @xmath41 , there is a spike ( delta function ) at @xmath146 , which accounts for the non - dispersive level at @xmath39 .    for fm all the core spins are @xmath13 ( say ) , so only @xmath14 spin electrons from b@xmath1 site get to delocalise while @xmath13 spin electrons remain localised at @xmath146 , which corresponds to the localised band in the sepctrum and the spike in the dos .",
    "so the localised level in fm is an @xmath13  spin level .",
    "the nature of this localised level however changes when we go to af phases . in collinear phases ,",
    "its easy to understand the nature of this localised band .",
    "take for example the case of a - type in fig.[fig : spina ] down panel with conduction path .",
    "the lattice is divided into two sublattices ( each of which are of layered zigzag shape ) , blue and red , such that , if ( say ) core spins in the @xmath25 sites in the blue sub - lattice are all @xmath13 , then the same in red sub - lattice are @xmath14 . as a result , in the blue sub - lattice , @xmath14 spin electrons get to delocalise , while @xmath13 spin electron remain localised . the opposite happens in the red sub - lattice .",
    "since these lattices are disconnected from each other , one can separately diagonalise them . but each of this sub - lattice , however complicated in shape , is a fm , so it gives @xmath147 of the levels localised at @xmath146 , which will be @xmath13 spin in blue sub - lattice , while it will be @xmath14 spin in red sublattice .",
    "since both the sub - lattices have same number of sites / unit cells , we get @xmath147 of the levels localised at @xmath146 but now spin degenerate .",
    "the delocalised states have also to be spin - degenerate , and their nature depends on the way the conduction paths divide the lattice into two sub - lattices .    for each spin channel",
    "the conduction paths are layered zigzag , 2 dimensional in the a type phase , while they are 3 dimensional in the c type phase .",
    "this appearance of the localised band is not restricted to just the collinear phases , but also happens for non - collinear phases , and even the paramagent .",
    "the model with only ` nearest neighbour ' ( bb@xmath1 ) hopping has a rich phase diagram .",
    "however , this has the artificial feature of a non dispersive level . in reality",
    "all materials have some degree of b@xmath1b@xmath1 hopping and we wish to illustrate the qualitative difference that results from this hopping .",
    "we explored two cases , @xmath141 and @xmath148 for these particle - hole asymmetric cases .      in fig.[sqplt2](a),(b )",
    "we show the structure factor data , at two densities , for ( a ) a type and ( b ) c type phases , to demonstrate one remarkable difference from the particle - hole symmetric case .",
    "as we saw earlier in fig.[sqplt1 ] for @xmath12 the structure factor data were very noisy for af phases , with many sub - dominant * q * peaks around the central peak .",
    "the saturation value for the a - type peak in the symmetric case was @xmath149 , while now it is @xmath150 , close to the ideal value of @xmath151 .",

    "in the couple of paragraphs below we try to create an understanding of how the phase diagram is affected by @xmath6 .",
    "there isnt , unfortunately , an understanding of the effects over the entire density window , but we can at least motivate the changes at low density .    for @xmath148 , the fm loses its stability to af phases even at low @xmath30 .",
    "that is puzzling since one would expect the fm phase to have the largest bandwidth .",
    "we recall that in the @xmath12 case , there is a localised band coming from b@xmath1 level for all the phases .",
    "the dispersion of this previously localised level causes the @xmath179 and @xmath25 to have a @xmath180 dependent separation , which was @xmath47 for all @xmath181 in the symmetric case .",

    "as we increase @xmath41 , a point comes where band edges of the fm and g , coincide .",
    "this is the point where fm loses its stability .",
    "the same arguement can be extended to 3d , with c and flux phases , just the role of the @xmath197s gets extended to 3d ( e.g , @xmath198 etc ) , and the correction in the separation is @xmath199 instead of @xmath200 . in fig .",

    "we already know that the ` binding energy ' and @xmath3 of magnetic phases reduce with increasing @xmath6 - but also that the ` noise ' in the cooling process also reduces quickly .",
    "if @xmath201 then the electrons could delocalise on the wide @xmath6 based band populating the non magnetic sites only .",
    "magnetic order would make little difference to electronic energies and the ` energy landscape ' in the space of spin configurations would be featureless , panel ( c ) in fig.18 .",

    "if @xmath12 then delocalisation takes place necessarily through the magnetic sites and the deep minima in configuration space represent ordered states while the ` grassy ' features indicate shallow metastable states close to them .",
    "our mc data probing af states at @xmath12 suggests this picture , curve ( a ) in fig.18 . at intermediate @xmath6",
    "the ordered states are shallower , but the metastable states seem to have been affected even more drastically , if our mc data , fig.11 , is to be taken seriously .",
    "while the discussion above seems to be merely an analysis of trends in the mc annealing process , a simpler energy landscape would make the occurence of af states more likely in the real materials as well .",
    "the real double perovskites are multiband materials , involving additional interaction effects and antisite disorder beyond what we have considered in this paper .",
    "we feel it is necessary to understand in detail the phase diagram of the ` simple ' model we have studied , and then move to more realistic situations .",
    "below , we first provide a qualitative comparison of the trends we observe with experimental data , and then move to a discussion of additional interactions .",
    "there are no clear experimental signatures of metallic af phases yet , driven by the kind of mechanism that we have discussed .",
    "so , the comparison to experiments is , at the moment , confined to the @xmath3 scales @xcite _ etc _ , of the ferromagnetic dp s . in a material like sfmo the electron density can be increased by doping la for sr , _",

    "sfmo has threefold degeneracy of the active , @xmath20 , orbitals while we have considered a one band model .",
    "when we create a correspondence by dividing the electron count by the maximum possible per unit cell ( 3 in our case , 9 in the real material ) , in our units @xmath204 corresponds to @xmath207 and @xmath206 to @xmath208 .    when @xmath12 , as a function of @xmath30 the @xmath3 peaks around @xmath209 , fig.8 , quite far from the experimental value",
    ". however , in the presence of @xmath148 and @xmath210 , fig.16 , the peak occurs above @xmath211 .",
    "so , modest @xmath6 can generate the ferromagnetic window that is observed , and produce a @xmath212 . for @xmath213ev ,",
    "this is in the right ballpark .",
    "unfortunately , attempts to increase @xmath30 via a site substitution also brings in greater antisite disorder ( b - b@xmath1 interchange ) and even the possibility of newer patterns of a site ordering ( ! ) complicating the analysis .",
    "for example , one would try compositions of the form : a@xmath202a@xmath214bb@xmath1o@xmath2 , where a and a@xmath1 have different valence in an attempt to change @xmath30 .",
    "the assumption is that the a@xmath1 only changes @xmath30 without affecting other electronic parameters , _",

    "this may not be true .",
    "in fact , at @xmath206 , the material aa@xmath1bb@xmath1o@xmath2 may have a specific a - a@xmath1-b - b@xmath1 ordering pattern that affects electronic parameters in a non trivial way and one can not understand this material as a perturbation on a@xmath215bb@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "in such a situation one needs guidance from experiments and _ ab initio _ theory to fix electronic parameters as @xmath216 is varied .",
    "all this before one even considers the inevitable antisite ( b - b@xmath1 ) disorder and its impact on magnetism @xcite .",
    "we have studied a one band model of double perovskites in three dimensions in the limit of strong electron - spin coupling on the magnetic site . the magnetic lattice in the cubic double perovskites is fcc and increasing the electron density leads from the ferromagnet , through a and c type collinear antiferromagnets , to spiral or ` flux ' phases close to half - filling .",
    "we estimate the @xmath3 of these phases , via monte carlo and variational calculation , and find the af @xmath3 to be significantly suppressed compared to the 2d case .",
    "we attribute it to the geometric frustration on the fcc lattice .",
