    "the underlying networks of many biological and social complex systems are distinguished from purely random graphs .",
    "these real - world networks often have the small - world property @xcite and scale - free ( power - law ) vertex degree profiles @xcite ; they have system - specific local structural motifs @xcite and often are organized into communities @xcite of different connection densities . in recent years models have been proposed to understand the structural properties of real - world complex systems @xcite ; among them the @xmath0rich - get - richer \" mechanism of network growth by preferential attachment @xcite gained great popularity . as the connection pattern affects considerably functions of a networked system , there may exist various feedback mechanisms which couple the system s dynamical performance ( efficiency , sensitivity , robustness , ... ) with the evolution of its structure .",
    "but the detailed interactions between dynamics and evolution are often unclear for real - world systems , and understanding complex networks from the angle of dynamics - structure interplay is still a challenging and largely unexplored research topic . among the few theoretical works on dynamics - driven network evolutions from the physics and the computer science communities ( see , e.g. , @xcite and",
    "review @xcite ) , the main focus has been on network evolutionary games for which network dynamics and evolution occur on comparable time scales . a payoff function is defined for the system , and vertices change their local connections to optimize gains . in many complex systems , however , the dynamical performance of a network is a global property which can not be predicted by only looking at the local structures .",
    "most structural changes in such systems , on the other hand , take place locally and relatively randomly , without knowing their consequences to the system s dynamical performance .",
    "the time - scales of network dynamics and network structural evolution can also be very different .",
    "will dynamics - structure coupling mechanisms build highly nontrivial architectures out of random , blind , and local structural mutations ?    in this work extensive simulations of dynamics - driven network evolution",
    "are performed on a simple model system , namely the local majority - rule ( lmr ) opinion dynamics of complex networks .",
    "there are two main motivations for this study .",
    "first , earlier analytical and simulation studies @xcite revealed that networks with heterogeneous structural organizations have remarkably better lmr dynamical performances than homogeneous networks .",
    "in complementary to these studies , we want to know , in this simple lmr dynamical system , to what extent the dynamical performance of a network can influence the evolution trajectory of the network s structure .",
    "second , as lmr - like dynamical processes are frequently encountered in neural and gene - regulation networks and other biological or social systems , it is hoped that a detailed study of dynamics  structure coupling in the model lmr system will also shed light on the structural evolution and optimization in real - world complex systems .    in the simulation , a fitness value",
    "is assigned to a network to quantitatively measure its efficiency of lmr dynamical performance .",
    "a slow ( in comparison with the lmr dynamics ) mutation - selection process is performed on a population of networks , and networks of higher fitness values are more likely to remain in the population .",
    "the network population dynamics reaches a steady state after passing through several transient stages .",
    "a steady - state network has high clustering coefficient @xcite and strong local degree - degree correlations , and the fraction @xmath1 of vertices in the network with degree @xmath2 resembles a power - law distribution of @xmath3 with @xmath4 .",
    "interestingly a global hub of degree proportional to network size @xmath5 spontaneously emerges in the network .",
    "these results bring new insights on the optimized network organization for lmr dynamics .",
    "they are also consistent with the opinion that feedback mechanisms from dynamics to structure could be a dominant force driving complex networks into heterogeneous structures @xcite .",
    "hopefully this work will stimulate studies on the detailed interactions between dynamics and structure in more realistic complex systems .",
    "the local - majority - rule dynamics runs on a network of @xmath5 vertices and @xmath6 undirected links , with @xmath7 being the mean connectivity . the network s adjacency matrix @xmath8 has entries @xmath9 if vertices @xmath10 and @xmath11 are connected by an edge or @xmath12 if otherwise .",
    "each vertex @xmath10 has an opinion ( spin ) @xmath13 that can be influenced by its nearest - neighbors . at each time step @xmath14 of the lmr dynamics",

    ", the lmr process will derive the system to a consensus state in which all the vertices share the same opinion . to measure a network s efficiency of performing the lmr process , we follow @xcite and choose the initial opinion patterns @xmath20 to be _ strongly disordered _ , with @xmath21 ( @xmath22 is the degree of vertex @xmath10 ) ; in other words a vertex ( either randomly chosen or reached by following a randomly chosen edge ) has probability one - half to be in the plus - opinion state . for networks containing @xmath23 vertices such strongly disordered patterns",
    "can be easily constructed : one first divide the vertices into two groups ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) of equal size and assign spin @xmath26 to vertices of group @xmath24 and spin @xmath27 to vertices of group @xmath25 ; and as long as @xmath28 , two vertices ( one from @xmath24 and the other from @xmath25 ) are randomly chosen and their positions are exchanged if and only if this exchange does not cause an increase in the value of @xmath29 .",
    "for a given network @xmath30 , we generate a total number @xmath31 of strongly disordered initial opinion patterns @xmath32 and , for each of them we run the lmr dynamics for one time step to reach the corresponding pattern @xmath33 .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the characteristic relaxation time of the lmr dynamics is determined by the mean escaping velocity of the network s opinion pattern from the strongly disordered region . in the present work",
    "we calculate a fitness parameter @xmath34 for network @xmath30 according to @xmath35 for networks with the same size @xmath5 and mean degree @xmath7 , we have checked that those with higher fitness values have shorter mean lmr consensus times @xcite .    the fitness @xmath36 as defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : fitness ] ) can also be evaluated using completely random configurations instead of random strongly disordered configurations as the initial conditions .",
    "when using random configurations as the initial conditions , we found that the main results of the present paper do not change , but the vertex - vertex correlation patterns of the network will be slightly affected ( i.e. , the @xmath37 value defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : r ] ) will be more close to zero ) .",
    "the network of a complex system is not fixed but changes with time .",
    "we focus on situations in which the typical time scale of network evolution is much longer than that of the dynamical process . in real - world systems ,",
    "modifications of network structure often occur distributedly and locally . in accordance with this , in the simulation a simple local edge - rewiring scheme as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : edgemove ] is employed ( similar simulation results obtained with other local or global mutation schemes will be reported elsewhere @xcite ) . for each vertex @xmath10 of the network with probability ( mutation rate ) @xmath38 propose the following @xmath39 edge redirection : randomly cut one of its edges @xmath40 to vertex @xmath11 and link this edge to vertex @xmath11 s nearest - neighbors @xmath2 .",

    ", a simple simulation rule could be to accept this mutation with probability unity if @xmath50 and with probability @xmath51 if otherwise , with @xmath52 controlling the strength of dynamics - structure coupling . when there is only mutation but no selection ( @xmath53 ) , it has already been known that the steady - state network s vertex - degree profile decays exponentially for large degrees @xcite ( see also the solid lines of fig .",
    "[ fig : degreedistribution ] ) . here",
    "we focus on the other limit of strong fitness selection @xmath54 and carry out the network evolution process through a population dynamics simulation of mutation and selection @xcite : starting with a set of @xmath55 networks uniformly sampled from the ensemble of random networks of size @xmath5 and mean connectivity @xmath7 , at each round of the evolution each parent network generates @xmath56 slightly mutated offsprings , resulting in an expanded population of @xmath57 networks ; the fitness values of these networks are estimated and the @xmath58 ones with the highest values survive and become parents for the next generation .",

    "one remarkable feature is that the steady - state network has a global hub whose connectivity is proportional to @xmath5 .",
    "this global hub samples the opinions of a finite population of the network ( especially those of the low - degree vertices , see below ) and serves as a global indicator of the system s state ; its emergence is completely due to the dynamics - structure coupling .",
    "to some extent this global hub balances the influences of the minority high - degree vertices ( see below ) and those of the majority low - degree vertices . such a global hub may correspond to news agencies and public medias in modern societies and to global transcription factors in biological cells .     and",

    "the global hub is crucial for this small - world property : if it is removed , the remaining subnetwork has much reduced mean clustering coefficient @xmath75 .",
    "there are strong degree - degree correlations in a steady - state network .",
    "first , the global hub prefers to interact with low - degree vertices .",
    "this preference can be measured by a parameter @xmath37 defined by @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the mean degree of nearest - neighbors of the global hub and @xmath78 is the averaged value of this mean degree over an ensemble of randomly shuffled networks .",
    "the steady - state value is @xmath79 for @xmath80 , @xmath67 and @xmath72 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : evolution ] ) . by this preference",
    "the @xmath81voices of low - degree vertices have a larger chance to be heard by the whole system .",
    "second , there are strong positive degree - degree correlations among vertices of a steady - state network ( excluding the global hub ) . to measure the extent of these correlations , we calculate the assortative - mixing index @xmath82 of the global hub - removed subnetwork following ref .",
    "a steady - state assortative - mixing index of @xmath83 for mutation rate @xmath72 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : evolution ] ) suggests that in the subnetwork high - degree vertices ( except the global hub ) are more likely than random to connect with other high - degree vertices .",
    "the steady - state vertex degree distributions for networks under dynamics - structure coupling deviate remarkably from those of the networks under only mutation ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : degreedistribution ] ) .",
    "besides the emergence of a global hub , the stead - state vertex degree distribution resembles a power - law form of @xmath84 where @xmath85 is a normailzation constant . for the data - set of fig .",

    "scale - free networks with decay exponent @xmath88 have shown to be particularly efficient for lmr dynamics , and the mean relaxation time of the dynamics on such a network does not increase with network size @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this work indicates that such heterogeneous optimal network structures might be reachable without employing any central planning and any intelligence .",
    "the system only needs to accumulate decentralized and local structural changes under the selection of dynamics - structure coupling .",
    "networks with pronounced power - law degree distributions also emerged in other model systems with comparable dynamicl and evolutionary time scales @xcite . in real - world systems , it was noticed by aldana @xcite that a major fraction of scale - free complex networks has their decay exponent @xmath89 in the tiny range of @xmath90 $ ] .",
    "the network evolution trajectory also shows interesting features . starting from an ensemble of random poissonian networks with size @xmath80 and",
    "mean degree @xmath91 , fig .",
    "[ fig : evolution ] shows that the evolution can be divided into four stages .",
    "in the first @xmath81dormant stage which lasts for about @xmath92 evolution steps for muatation rate @xmath72 , the degree distribution of the networks changes gradually into the form shown by the solid line in the inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : degreedistribution ] .",
    "the fitness values of the networks are small and increase only very slowly , the maximal vertex degrees of the networks are also small , and the degree - degree correlations in the network are weak .",
    "this dormant stage is followed by a @xmath81reforming stage which lasts for about @xmath93 steps for @xmath64 .",
    "a global hub emerges and its degree rapidly exceeds those of all the other vertices of the network , the subnetwork assortative index @xmath82 also increases rapidly , and the degree distribution of the network becomes power law - like at the end of this stage .",
    "this reforming stage has rapid increase in the mean fitness value ; it is follows by a long @xmath81structural fine - tunning stage ( lasts for about @xmath94 steps at @xmath64 ) of slow increase in network fitness , maximal degree , and assortative mixing .",
    "finally the network reaches the steady - state in which the network s fitness value saturates but its local structures are being modified continuously .",
    "( [ eq : r ] ) ] , and the assortative - mixing index @xmath82 ( of the global hub - removed subnetwork ) as a function of simulation steps .",
    "the network size is @xmath95 , mean vertex degree is @xmath96 , and minimal degree is @xmath68 .",
    "the mutation rate is @xmath72 ( black and red curves , maximal evolution time to @xmath97 steps ) or @xmath98 ( blue and green curves , maximal evolution time to @xmath99 steps ) .",
    "the population dynamics starts from an ensemble of random poissonian networks ( red and green curves , which initially are the two lower curves ) or an ensemble of modified random poissonian networks with a single vertex of degree @xmath100 ( black and blue curves , which initially are the two upper curves ) . ]",
    "we have performed simulations with different initial conditions and confirmed that the steady - states are not affected @xcite .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : evolution ] demonstrates that the steady - state networks obtained from two different initial conditions share the same dynamical performances and the same structural properties .",
    "( if the network initially has a global hub of degree @xmath100 but otherwise is completely random , during the evolution the degree of the global hub decreases but the fitness of the network increases ( fig .",
    "[ fig : evolution ] ) .",
    "this indicates that the existance of a global hub , heterogeneous degree profile , and strong local degree - degree correlations are all important for high dynamical performance . ) on the other hand , the evolution process is greatly influenced by the network mutation rate @xmath38 .",
    "for the same network size @xmath5 and mean connectivity @xmath7 , the steady - state networks obtained with a lower network mutation rate @xmath38 have better dynamical performances ( fig .",
    "[ fig : evolution ] ) .",
    "as the network topology becomes heterogeneous , most local structural changes will tend to deteriorate the dynamical performance .",
    "when the mutation rate is relatively large , in one evolution step the probability for the combination of @xmath101 local and distributed mutations to enhance the network s dynamical performance will decrease rapidly with @xmath102 .",
    "the balance between structural entropy ( randomness ) and dynamical performance then makes the system cease to be further optimized . for the dynamics - structure interaction to work most efficiently ,",
    "it is therefore desirable that the time scale of network evolution be much slower than the time scale of network dynamics .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the evolution and optimization of complex networks from the perspective of dynamics - structure mutual influence . through extensive simulation on a simple prototypical model process",
    ", the local - majority - rule dynamics , we showed that if there exist feedback mechanisms from a network s dynamical performance to its structure , the network can be driven into highly heterogeneous structures with a global hub , strong local correlations in its connection pattern , and power law - like vertex - degree distributions .",
    "the steady - state networks reached by this dynamics - driven evolution will have better dynamical performance if network evolution occurs much slowly than the dynamical process on the network .",
    "for the lmr dynamics specifically , this work confirmed and extended previous studies @xcite by showing that scale - free networks with decay exponent @xmath88 indeed are optimal and can be reached without the need of any central planning .",
    "besides the scale - free property and strong local structural correlations , a steady - state network also has a global hub which serves a global indicator of the system s state by sampling the opinions of a large fraction of the vertices of the system .",
    "real - world complex systems of cause are much more complicated than the simple model systems studied in this paper .",
    "different mechanisms may be contributing simultaneously to the evolution of a real - world complex network . the present paper suggested that the interplay between dynamics and structure can be an important driving force for the formation and stabilization of heterogeneous structures which are ubiquitous in biological and social systems @xcite .",
