    "in this study we consider the problem of parameter - free identification of a class of dynamical systems . the approach we propose is derived from a general method for the reconstruction of the constitutive relations in systems described by partial differential equations ( pdes ) which was initially introduced in @xcite and further developed in @xcite , see also @xcite",
    "the idea is that , given an autonomous evolution equation @xmath0 for some quantity @xmath1 ( defined in a finite or infinite dimension with @xmath2 denoting time ) , one seeks to optimally reconstruct the flux function @xmath3 , so that the system outputs best match , in a suitably defined sense , with the measurements available .",
    "as shown schematically in figure [ fig : f ] , the originality of this approach is that the function @xmath3 is reconstructed directly as a _ continuous _ object , rather than employing a truncated polynomial or other galerkin expansion . in @xcite",
    "we reviewed the mathematical foundations and some computational aspects of this approach applied to the reconstruction of state - dependent transport coefficients in a class of systems described by pdes . in the present investigation we adapt this method to the problem of identification of the propagator function @xmath4 , @xmath5^t$ ] , in a finite - dimensional dynamical system @xmath6 with the state vector @xmath7^t \\in \\rr^n$ ] .",
    "to fix attention , instead of working with an abstract formulation , we will focus on a specific problem concerning a three - dimensional ( @xmath8 ) model characterized by oscillatory dynamics with a stable limit cycle . in many real - life physical problems with infinite - dimensional state spaces and evolution described by pdes such systems",
    "arise as reduced - order models providing low - dimensional approximate description in the neighborhood of fixed points and limit cycles .    in some cases propagator @xmath9",
    "may be derived from the description of the full plant based on first principles . in general , however , the reduced - order model is inferred from experimental or numerical data .",
    "such reduced models are of paramount importance as test - beds for the development of our understanding of system dynamics .",
    "they are also useful as low - cost surrogates guiding optimization and real - time control design for expensive full - scale models . in all cases ,",
    "typical model identification is generally performed in three steps : ( 1 ) selection of the state space @xmath10 which is large enough to capture the behaviour of interest and at the same time sufficiently small to allow one to exploit the analytical / numerical advantages of the surrogate plant ; ( 2 ) structure identification of the propagator @xmath11 , e.g. , determination of the polynomial degree of its components @xmath12 , @xmath13 ; and ( 3 ) parameter identification , e.g. , inference of the polynomial coefficients from time - resolved trajectories @xmath14 .",
    "these different steps are illustrated schematically in figure [ fig : f]a .",
    "the challenge of this approach is to find the right balance between the robustness of the model identification , requiring only a few tunable parameters , and a good accuracy for which a larger number of parameters is typically needed .",

    "this effect as well is a consequence of the lack of phase - dependence in ansatz and .",
    "in this section we analyze a number of computational and physical modelling aspects of the proposed approach which can be important in applications .",
    "we begin by examining the accuracy of the cost functional gradients in section [ toc : validation ] , followed by a study of the robustness of iterations in section [ toc : discussion_computational ] and conclude with some insights about physical modelling in section [ toc : discussion_physical ] .",
    "a key element of optimization algorithm are the cost functional gradients and a standard approach to their validation consists in computing the directional gteaux differential @xmath253 , @xmath81 , for some arbitrary perturbations @xmath254 in two different ways , namely , using a finite - difference approximation ( with step size @xmath255 ) and using the inner product of the adjoint - based gradient with the perturbation @xmath254 , namely riesz representation , and then examining the ratio of the two quantities , i.e. , @xmath256 } { \\int_{\\i } \\bnabla^{l_2 } \\j_i ( r ) \\ , g'_i(r ) \\ , dr } , \\quad i=1,2 , \\label{eq : kappa}\\ ] ] for a range of values of @xmath255 .",
    "if the gradient @xmath257 is computed correctly , then for intermediate values of @xmath255 , @xmath258 will be close to the unity .",
    "remarkably , this behavior can be observed in figures [ fig : kappa]a , b corresponding to problems @xmath155 and @xmath156 over a range of @xmath255 spanning about 8 orders of magnitude . the quantity shown in figures [ fig : kappa]a ,",
    "b is latexmath:[$\\log| \\kappa_i(\\epsilon ) - 1    digits to which the two ways to evaluate @xmath253 in agree .",
    "furthermore , we also observe that refining the resolution @xmath260 of the time interval @xmath182 $ ] yields values of @xmath258 closer to the unity .",
    "the reason is that in the `` optimize - then - discretize '' paradigm adopted here such refinement of the discretization leads to a better approximation of the continuous gradient .",
    "as can be expected , the quantities @xmath258 deviate from the unity for very small values of @xmath255 , which is due to the subtractive cancellation ( round - off ) errors in finite - differencing , and also for large values of @xmath255 , which is due to the truncation errors , both of which are well - known effects .",
    "in this section we focus on the effect that the choice of initial guess @xmath261 , @xmath81 , has on the reconstructed functions @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "we note that , given the nonlinearity of system , optimization problems @xmath155 and @xmath156 may be nonconvex and optimality conditions and characterize minimizers which are only _",
    "local_. thus , different initial guesses may in principle give rise to different reconstructions and convergence to a global minimum can not be a priori assured .",
    "we investigate this issue in figures [ fig : gig]a and [ fig : gig]b where we show the reconstructions obtained , respectively , in problems @xmath155 and @xmath156 using different initial guesses generally much worse than mean - field model used in section [ toc : results ] .",
    "as regards problem @xmath155 , we note in figure [ fig : gig]a that accurate reconstructions are obtained using even relatively poor initial guesses @xmath162 .",
    "on the other hand , in figure [ fig : gig]b we see that in problem @xmath156 the reconstruction fails for a less accurate initial guess @xmath220 .",
    "these two examples are representative of the behavior we generally observed in our calculations and we conclude that problem @xmath155 appears more robust with respect to the choice of the initial guess than problem @xmath156 .",
    "we also noted that in both problems convergence tends to be more sensitive to the values assumed by the initial guesses @xmath162 and @xmath220 at @xmath124 and @xmath135 than to their behavior for intermediate values of @xmath25 .",
    "results from figure [ fig : gig ] are corroborated by the corresponding histories of the cost functionals in figures [ fig : jig]a and [ fig : jig]b .",
    "we note that in the case of the poorest initial guess in problem @xmath156 , cost functional @xmath262 reveals hardly any decrease with the iterations at all . while in the cases of successful reconstructions",
    "the cost functionals @xmath263 and @xmath262 drop over several orders of magnitude , they never attain values lower than @xmath264 .",
    "this is a consequence of the phase - dependent behavior of the measurements which can not be resolved using ansatz in the form , cf .",
    "assumption [ ass1](a ) , see also the inset in figure [ fig : ra1a3]a .",
    "inverse problems of the type considered here often tend to be ill - posed , in the sense that small perturbations to the data , for example due to noise , may result in significant changes in the computed solution .",
    "suitable regularization , for instance , using tikhonov s technique @xcite , may be required to stabilize the solution procedure in such situations . to focus attention in the present study",
    ", we concentrated on the structure of the gradients and did not investigate the effect of noise on the reconstructions , hence such regularization was not necessary .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a thorough analysis of regularization applied to a related reconstruction problem .",
    "in this section we propose some physical interpretation of the numerical reconstruction results from section [ toc : results ] .",
    "we note in figures [ fig : g123 ] and [ fig : ra1a3 ] that the identified phase - invariant oscillation model is in fact in remarkably good agreement with the data obtained from the solution of the navier - stokes equation .",
    "a small difference between the model and the data is visible as wiggles due to the second harmonic present in the measurements which violates the phase - invariance assumed in our model ansatz , cf .",
    "assumption [ ass1](a ) .",
    "this difference can be easily removed by a simple pre - processing of the measurement data . referring to appendix [ toc : pod ]",
    ", we note that the pod eigenvalue @xmath265 , representing the variance of @xmath22 , is larger than the eigenvalue @xmath266 which represents the variance of @xmath23 . the following rescaling transformation    [ eqn : a1a2rescaling ] @xmath267    ensures equipartition of energy in the new variables @xmath268 and @xmath269 while conserving the total energy in both modes .",
    "this rescaling effectively removes the second harmonics from @xmath270 , @xmath81 , which could be used as new inputs for the reconstruction .",
    "however , we refrained from applying in the computations reported in section [ toc : results ] in order to show the power of the proposed identification method to deal with data which can not be perfectly matched by the model .",
    "another observation concerning figure [ fig : g123 ] is the significant deviation of reconstructed functions @xmath149 and @xmath150 from the parabolic mean - field relations .",
    "evidently , higher - order corrections , such as @xmath271 , @xmath272 , etc . , are required for a better agreement between the identified propagators @xmath273 , @xmath81 , and the expansions used in the mean - field model .",
    "the information which higher - order terms ought to be included in the model as opposed to an a priori fixed polynomial expansion used typically in model identification is therefore the unique advantage of the proposed identification strategy .",
    "we note that odd powers of @xmath25 can be excluded by phase - invariance considerations .",
    "in addition , with our reconstruction method we were able to determine more accurate values of the instability growth rate at the origin and the oscillation frequency at the limit cycle than used in mean - field model .",
    "we stress that in fact such seemingly insignificant modifications of the structure of the reduced - order model may already affect its utility for various control applications .",
    "these results also shed light on the validity of mean - field model .",
    "initially , the mean - field theory @xcite was derived to be valid near the onset of the oscillation only .",
    "we probed the applicability of this model by applying it at a reynolds number @xmath274 which is more than twice the critical value of @xmath61 . hence",
    ", the deviation of @xmath149 and @xmath150 from does not invalidate the mean - field theory .",
    "one reason for this deviation is the change of the structure of the vortex street during the transient .",
    "the optimal oscillatory modes deform from the stability eigenmodes into the pod modes while the fluctuation center moves upstream and the frequency and wavenumber increase @xcite .",
    "similarly , the mean - field correction ( the shift mode , cf .  ) changes during the transient @xcite which has a noticeable effect on the mean - field model @xcite .",
    "finally , the results concerning the identified descriptor system are also relevant to the empirical 9-dimensional galerkin model accounting for the base - flow variation and for the first four harmonics @xcite .",
    "the initial exponential growth of the first harmonic is limited by the base - flow variation ( which reduces the production of fluctuation energy ) and , to a lesser extent , by the energy transfer from the first into higher harmonics .",
    "the energy transfer may be accounted for by an energy - dependent eddy viscosity in the mean - field system . under certain assumptions ( see , e.g.@xcite ) , a generalized landau equation @xmath275 can be derived , where @xmath95 denotes the growth rate near the fixed point @xmath124 and @xmath109 , @xmath103 characterize the damping from the @xmath276-th and from higher harmonics , respectively . by carefully comparing the 9-dimensional galerkin model with the identified phase - invariant system it may be therefore possible to determine the values of @xmath109 and @xmath103 , or even to correct the powers of the new terms in . a complete derivation and",
    "an in - depth discussion of this problem is outside the scope of the present study .",
    "we have proposed and validated a novel method for model identification which is an adaptation of an approach already used in the context of systems described by pdes @xcite . as indicated in figure [ fig : f ] ,",
    "we depart from the traditional approach of ( 1 ) characterizing the propagator of the dynamical system in a parameter space and then ( 2 ) performing a parameter identification .",
    "thus , arbitrary polynomial expansions of the propagator may be performed a posteriori ( following the solution of the optimal reconstruction problem ) at a practically vanishing cost .",
    "in addition , the performance of parametric models may easily be assessed and , if necessary , improved by introducing additional terms motivated by the form of the reconstructed constitutive relation .",
    "the method is applied to a three - dimensional descriptor system with three a priori undetermined relations describing the fluctuation growth , frequency and mean - field correction as functions of the fluctuation energy . as a benchmark problem we chose the onset of laminar von krmn vortex shedding behind a circular cylinder .",
    "results of a direct numerical simulation are transcribed into the mode amplitudes of a minimal 3-state galerkin model @xcite which are then captured with remarkable accuracy by our identified descriptor system .",
    "the form of the reconstructed system is marked by a noticeable departure from the mean - field models and may therefore guide the refinement of the latter by inclusion of higher - order terms .",
    "we emphasize that the usefulness of reduced - order models for flow control applications may in fact depend on such differences .    as regards future research directions , while the present results offer a proof of the concept for the proposed approach based on a rather well - understood example , the key question is extension of this method to the identification of models with more complicated structure featuring , for example , multiple time scales , state space of a higher dimension , coexistence of several oscillation frequencies , non - trivial phase dependence and higher - dimensional inertial manifolds . as regards the first issue , one can consider a modification of our model problem  with assumption [ ass1](b ) revised to allow @xmath277 to be a `` fast '' variable .",
    "while in such setting our computational approach would formally remain unchanged ( except that problem @xmath204 would be replaced with a problem similar to @xmath155 or @xmath156 ) , it is interesting how it would actually perform in practice . dealing with some of the other aspects will require formulation of the reconstruction problems in terms of propagator functions depending on more than just one state variable ( @xmath25 in the examples considered in the present study ) .",
    "this will , in turn , lead to a number of interesting questions at the level of numerical analysis and scientific computing related to the evaluation of the cost functional gradients .",
    "an emerging application which involves some of the aforementioned extensions is related to the question of optimal parametrization of subgrid turbulence representations which is an important open problem in theoretical fluid mechanics @xcite . in the context of galerkin reduced - order models",
    ", it may take the form of an additional dissipative term with the magnitude proportional to an `` eddy viscosity '' @xmath278 @xmath279 where @xmath280 represents the stabilizing viscous term of the navier - stokes equation in the galerkin system .",
    "in general , this term can be proven to be energy dissipative for all orthonormal systems of modes and a large class of boundary conditions .",
    "for some analytical modes , e.g. , the stokes modes , it can be shown that matrix @xmath281 is diagonal and negative - definite .",
    "there is abundant evidence @xcite that nonlinear closure strategies perform better as regards stabilization of system .",
    "assuming @xmath282 gives rise to an identification problem analogous to @xmath155 and @xmath156 , and one can use the algorithm described in section [ toc : computation ] to determine optimal closure strategies leading to the best possible reconstruction of the available data .",
    "preliminary identification results already obtained based on a reduced - order model with dimension @xmath283 applied to a complex mixing - layer flow are quite encouraging and reveal some nontrivial physical insights .",
    "they will be reported in the near future upon completion of the study .",
    "we also remark that a surprisingly large set of modelling and control problems can be cast in a similar form of function identification of a descriptor system @xmath284 for reasons of simplicity , let us assume that function @xmath11 is known and that function @xmath285 needs to be determined .",
    "if @xmath286 characterizes the slow modes , then @xmath287 represents the inertial manifold to be identified from a given system trajectory @xcite .",
