    "the density of the minimal bubbles scales with the @xmath166 exponent , in accordance with fig .",
    "[ universality](b ) . * after the formation of minimal bubbles near @xmath146 the magnetic field keeps growing and the strength of the non - linear zeeman term in the hamiltonian is increasing .",
    "this increasing term is cooling the system towards it instantaneous ground state , where the @xmath43-fraction , determined by the conserved magnetization , is x_0(b )  =  .",
    "the size of the bubbles needs to grow like @xmath167 to keep in pace with the increasing @xmath168 .",

    "these values should coincide if the system separates into perfect 2c and @xmath43 domains .",
    "nevertheless we can see some deviation from the predicted value that is slightly stronger for @xmath136 than @xmath161 .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the density in @xmath43 and 2c is not exactly the same due to the finite ratio @xmath169 , and the fact that 2c domains always contain a small @xmath170 component .",
    "this is especially noticeable at small quench times , see inset in fig .",

    ", width=321 ]    the above argument has implications for correlations in the distribution of the minimal @xmath43-bubbles along the system .",
    "when a @xmath43-bubble is growing , the conserved magnetization in its neighborhood is increasing making it less favorable for another bubble to form there , because the increasing magnetization drives the neighborhood towards the regime of stability of the 2c phase .",
    "the outcome is effectively the same as if the bubbles repelled : there is anti - bunching in their distribution along the system . crudely speaking",

    "[ g1_g2_profiles ] and  [ g1_g2_profiles_long ] . before the appearance of domains seeds at @xmath177 ms",
    ", the state of atoms in the @xmath178 component corresponds to a bogoliubov vacuum , characterized by a lack of coherence ( delta - like correlation function ) . during the formation of domains , coherence over some spatial scale",
    "is established , and finally the correlation function stabilizes in the shape presented in fig .",
    "[ g1_g2_profiles_long ] .",
    "we note that in the absence of domains , the correlation function of @xmath80 and @xmath81 components displays full coherence , as the system is in the condensed state .",
    "this is due to the finite system size , which allows for condensation in one dimension  @xcite .",
    "closer investigation of the above correlation functions allows us to make some interesting conclusions about the resulting spin domain state .",
    "the shape of @xmath179 , with slowly decaying oscillating tails , is characteristic for systems such as liquids or amorphous solids , which display local anti - correlations of density fluctuations , but no density long - range order .",
    "this is consistent with the apparent semi - regularity of domain positions shown in fig .",
    "[ histogram ] . on the other hand",
    ", the function @xmath180 does not follow this pattern , as there are almost no oscillations and the spatial decay is much faster .",
    "in fact , the first - order correlation function decays to zero on a length scale corresponding to the distance between neighboring domains .",
    "this indicates that there is no phase coherence between the domains , and consequently , spin domains can be seen as a set of quasicondensates .",
    "this effect is due to the existence the insulating 2c phase between the @xmath43 domains , which prevents tunneling of @xmath178 atoms and phase locking .",
    "the same effect can be seen for domains of the 2c phase .",
    "we described in detail formation of @xmath43 domains in a transition from the antiferromagnetic 2c phase to the separated @xmath43 + 2c phase . as the control parameter ( magnetic field )",
    "is turned on , it crosses the critical value @xmath181 when the 2c phase becomes dynamically unstable towards the exponential growth of @xmath43 fluctuations .",
    "these fluctuations are seeds for the @xmath43 domains in the phase separated phase .",
    "the very passage across this instability is described by the kibble - zurek ( kz ) theory and , in particular , the density of the @xmath43 seeds scales according to the kz scaling laws .",
    "however , it is impossible for most of the @xmath43 seeds to continue growing until they become the fully fledged @xmath43 domains , because their density would be too high to be compatible with the conserved total magnetization .",
    "thus the @xmath43 seeds are subject to a quick ( non - linear ) post - selection that happens on the same time - scale @xmath100 as the kz mechanism and decimates their density just to satisfy the conservation law .",
    "the net outcome is a finite density of @xmath43-bubbles whose density satisfies a scaling law that is different from the kz scaling .    the initial size of the @xmath43 bubbles does not depend on the transition rate , but after their formation the size grows with the magnetic field in such a way that the fraction of the system occupied by the @xmath43 phase keeps in pace with the same fraction in the ground state of the @xmath43 + 2c phase for a given magnetic field .",
    "one of the implications of the post - selection mechanism is that the @xmath43 bubbles are positioned in a semi - regular fashion like in an imperfect crystal lattice .",
    "what is more , there are no phase correlations between different bubbles : they are a set of mutually phase - uncorrelated condensates of the @xmath53 component .",
    "the same is true for the train of 2c - domains that separate the @xmath43 condensates .",
