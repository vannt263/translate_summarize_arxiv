    "networks bestow benefits  tangible benefits such as physical and monetary resources and intangible benefits such as social support , solidarity , influence , information , expertise , popularity , companionship and shared activity  on the individuals and groups who belong to the network .",
    "such resources allow individuals to do better in the network ; they help individuals accomplish tasks , produce and spread information , broker interactions across social groups , display influence on other individuals , gain more knowledge , or enjoy more emotional and social support . the concept of _ social capital _ has come to embody a set of different incarnations of the benefits attained by social groups via networked societal interactions @xcite-@xcite .",
    "+   + contemporary sociologists have established different definitions and conceptualizations for social capital .",
    "for instance , coleman has defined the social capital as _  a function of social structure producing advantage \" _",
    "@xcite , and he advanced social capital as a conceptual tool that puts economic rationality into a social context @xcite@xcite . social capital for bourdieu is related to the size of network and the volume of past accumulated social capital commanded by an individual @xcite .",
    "bourdieu considers that clear profit is the main reason for an individual to engage in and maintain links in a network , and the individuals potential for accruing social profit and control of capital are non - uniformly distributed .",
    "both conceptualizations of coleman and bourdieu are related ; they view social capital as existing in relationships and ties , and they postulate that _ density _ and _ closure _ are distinctive advantages of capital . while such vision assumes that _ strong ties _ ( the links between homogeneous and like - minded individuals ) are the prominent sources of social capital , other sociologists such as granovetter , putnam , and burt have argued that _ weak ties _ ( the links between diverse and weakly connected network components ) are also a source of capital @xcite-@xcite . that is , individuals who can broker connections between otherwise disconnected social groups are more likely to connect non - redundant sources of information , thus promoting for innovation and new ideas @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "burt provided a generalized framework for social capital , viewing bonding capital in connected communities as a source for bridging capital for individuals who connect these communities .",
    "+   + as it is for other forms of capital , inequality is displayed in the creation of social capital @xcite ; that is to say , social capital accrues over time as networks emerge and evolve , and since individuals gain different social positions in the emergent network , capital is not created uniformly across agents ;  better connected \" agents possess more capital . while there are a number of somewhat different definitions of social capital in the literature , these definitions share the following set of features .",
    "first , social capital is a metaphor about advantage , and it can be thought of as the contextual complement of human capital ; it is not depleted by use , but rather depleted by non - use .",
    "second , social capital is a function of the collective social structure , and the social positions of individuals ; well connected individuals possess more capital , and well connected networks possess a larger shared value",
    ". finally , the creation of social capital exhibits inequality due to the heterogeneity of norms and behaviors of the different social groups , which reflects on their positions in the network . +   + motivated by this discussion , this paper aims at establishing the micro - foundations of emerging social capital in an evolving network .",
    "in particular , we present a comprehensive mathematical model for dynamic network formation , where agents belonging to heterogeneous social groups take link formation decisions ( e.g.  follow \" a user on twitter or researchgate @xcite @xcite ,  cite \" a paper that is indexed by google scholar , etc ) which on one hand gives rise to an endogenously formed network , and on the other hand creates social capital for individual agents and groups .",
    "we view social capital as : _  any advantage or asset that is accrued by an individual or a social group in an evolving network due to the social position that they hold in the underlying network structure .",
    "an advantage can correspond to the extent of popularity , prestige , or centrality of an individual ; or the density and quality of an individual s ego network . \" _ in our model , we consider that _ homophily _ , which is an individual s tendency to connect to similar individuals @xcite , contextualizes economic rationality , i.e. homophily is what creates the incentives for individuals to connect to each other .",
    "however , the way individuals meet , the number of links they form , and the way trust propagates among them is governed by norms and behaviors , which generally vary from one social group to another .",
    "we view the different forms of social capital as being emergent by virtue of an evolving network , where the evolution of the network is highly influenced by both the actions of individuals , as well as the norms and behaviors of social groups . due to the heterogeneity of the norms and behaviors of different social groups ,",
    "social capital inequality is exhibited , and some groups would collectively acquire more prominent positions in the network than others . in the following subsection , we briefly describe the basic elements of our model .",
    "the central goal of the paper is to study the micro - foundations of different forms of emerging social capital via a mathematical model for network evolution . in our model ,",
    "networks are formed over time by the actions of boundedly rational agents that join the network and meet other agents via a random process that is highly influenced by the dynamic network structure and the characteristics of the agents themselves .",
    "thus , networks evolve over time as a stochastic process driven by the individual agents , where the formation of _ social ties _ among agents are in part endogenously determined , as a function of the current network structure itself , and in part exogenously , as a function of the individual characteristics of the agents .",
    "agents have bounded rationality , i.e. they only have information about other agents they meet over time , they are not able to observe the global network structure or reason about links formed by others , and they are _ myopic _ in the sense that they take linking decisions without taking possible future meetings into account .",
    "we focus on the impact of various exogenous parameters that describe the norms and behaviors of heterogeneous social groups , on the endogenously evolving network structure , and consequently on the emerging social capital .",
    "1 depicts all such exogenous and endogenous parameters . in the following ,",
    "we provide definitions for the exogenous parameters under study . + * 1- type distribution : * agents are heterogeneous as they possess type attributes that designate the social groups to which they belong .",
    "a social group is a group of individuals with the same occupation , social class , age , gender , religion , race or ethnicity , and are assumed to follow the same norms and behavior .",
    "the experiences of the different interacting social groups in the network are generally not symmetric ; thus , social capital is created non - uniformly across them .",
    "the type distribution corresponds to the relative population share of different social groups , and represents the fraction of agents of each type in the network .",
    "we say that an agent belongs to a _ type minority _ to qualitatively describe a scenario where the fraction of agents of the corresponding type in the population is small , and we say that an agent belongs to a _ type majority _ otherwise . + * 2- homophily : * homophily refers to the tendency of agents to connect to other similar - type agents ; it is widely regarded as a pervasive feature of social networks @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "we capture the extent to which an agent is _ homophilic _ by an _",
    "exogenous homophily index _ , which we formally define in section 2 .",
    "the homophily index can be thought of as the amount of  intolerance \" that a certain type of agents have towards making contacts with other types .",
    "it can also represent the  closed - mindedness \" of a social group ; low homophilic tendency means that agents are eager to connect and accept views of other social groups , whereas high homophilic tendency means that agents restrict their social ties to only like - minded individuals . + * 3- social gregariousness : * some types of agents can be more _",
    "sociable _ than others , and thus are willing to form more links .",
    "social gregariousness is simply measured by the minimum number of links an agent is willing to make . + * 4- structural opportunism : * agents in the network are said to be _ opportunistic _ if they exploit their contacts to find new contacts ; thus , agents are more likely to link with the neighbors of their neighbors if they are opportunistic .",
    "structural opportunism can also be interpreted as the _ flow of trust _ among individuals ; each agent trusts the connections of his neighbors more than he trusts others .",
    "opportunism induces _ closure _ in the network , i.e. connections of an individual are well connected , which on one hand may be thought of as a source of increasing social support for an individual , and on the other hand it can lead to information redundancy , i.e. all connections of an individual possess similar information since they are well connected among each other .",
    "structural opportunism can also correspond to a property of a behavior - dependent meeting mechanism ; for instance , users in twitter are expected to _ retweet _",
    "the tweets posted by users they follow , which leads to the followers of followers of a certain user to follow him .",
    "similarly , researchers find new papers to cite by looking at the references of papers that they have already cited .",
    "+ we focus on three different incarnations of social capital that agents gain as the network evolves .",
    "these forms of capital differ in terms of the type of advantage they offer to agents , the way they are created and distributed among agents and social groups , and their dependence on the underlying norms and behaviors of social groups , which are abstracted by the exogenous parameters .",
    "we focus on _ directed networks _",
    ", i.e. networks in which ties are formed unilaterally such as twitter and citation networks . in particular , we focus on the following forms of social capital that emerge in such networks . + * 1- bonding capital : * we define the bonding capital as the aggregate informational and social benefits that an individual draws from its direct neighbors in the network .",
    "the bonding capital depends only on an individual s ego network ( direct connections ) , and is invariant to the global network structure as long as the local ego network is preserved .",
    "the bonding capital increases if the ego network is more homogeneous ; individuals are better off when connecting to other similar individuals .",
    "this is because more similar individuals are more likely to provide more social support and more relevant information .",
    "since in our model agents form links driven by homophilic incentives , we measure the bonding capital by the agents utility functions .",
    "this form of capital is close to the definitions of coleman and bourdieu @xcite-@xcite . + * 2- popularity capital : * in our model , we consider a directed social network , thus links are formed by an individual and others also form links towards that individual .",
    "individuals gain bonding capital by forming links to others , and they also gain popularity capital by having other individuals form links to them .",
    "the popularity capital represents an individual s ability to influence others .",
    "that is , an individual s popularity capital allows it to better spread information and ideas in the network , and also to gain support and agreement on the individual s views and opinions .",
    "we measure the popularity capital of an individual by simply counting the number of individuals forming links with that individual . + * 3- bridging capital : * individuals who connect different social groups are able to control the flow of information across those groups and obtain non - redundant information from diverse segregated communities , which allows them to come up with innovations and new ideas @xcite .",
    "thus , individuals can acquire a _ bridging capital _ because of their centrality in the network rather than their popularity or the quality of their ego networks .",
    "we measure the bridging capital using a graph theoretic centrality measure , namely , the _ betweenness centrality_. + examples of bonding capital include the knowledge acquired by citing research papers , information and news obtained from following users on twitter , etc .",
    "popularity capital includes the number of citations associated with a published paper , the impact factor of a journal , the number of followers of a user on twitter @xcite , etc .",
    "examples of bridging capital include conducting interdisciplinary research , creating cross - cultural memes on twitter , etc .",
    "bonding capital helps individuals acquire knowledge , information and support , which allows them to accomplish tasks @xcite , whereas popularity capital can give financial returns ( such as research funds for popular scholars ) , or intellectual influence ( such as in the case of citation networks ) @xcite . finally , bridging capital leads to innovation @xcite , i.e. innovative interdisciplinary research @xcite ; cross - cultural creative content generated by internet users @xcite ; or acquisition of non - redundant information about job opportunities in informal organizational networks @xcite . fig .",
    "1 depicts the framework of the paper ; we focus on four different exogenous parameters , which abstract the norms and behaviors of social groups , and study their impact on the emergence of the three forms of social capital discussed above .",
    "the central questions addressed in this paper are : how do bonding , popularity , and bridging forms of capital emerge simultaneously in an evolving network ? which social groups possess which forms of capital ?",
    "how is the capital accrued by a social group affected by its norms and behavior ?",
    "we classify our results based on the different forms of capital as follows .",
    "+ * 1- bonding capital and the egocentric value of networking : * in section 3 , we study the emergence of bonding capital by characterizing the _ ego networks _ of individual agents in terms of the time needed for an agent to form its ego network , and the types of agents in that network .",
    "we show that majority and opportunistic types are more likely to establish their ego networks in a short time period .",
    "moreover , we show that extreme homophilic tendencies for all social groups is a necessary and sufficient condition for maximizing the aggregate bonding capital of the society  so we show that polarization in a society maximizes bonding capital .",
    "however , we also show that polarization in a society leads to `` structural holes '' in the network that is formed , and these structural holes hinder the exchange of information and ideas .",
    "+ * 2- popularity capital and preferential attachment : * in section 4 , we show that the acquisition of _ popularity capital _ displays a _ preferential attachment _ effect due to the individuals structural opportunism .",
    "in other words , the popular individuals get more popular as structural opportunism promotes the propagation of trust and reputation across the network , which endows popular agents with  reputational advantages \" over time .",
    "furthermore , we show that in tolerant ( non - homophilic ) societies , an individual s age and the collective gregariousness of social groups are the forces that determine an agent s popularity capital , whereas homophily can create asymmetries in the levels of popularity attained by different social groups ; more gregarious types of agents have more chances to become popular , whereas the type distribution plays no significant role in the rate of accumulation of popularity capital . + * 3- bridging capital and the strength of weak ties : * in section 5 , we show via simulations that in a homophilic society , individuals who belong to less gregarious , less opportunistic , or major types are likely to be more _ central _ in the network and thus acquire a bridging capital within their social groups .",
    "moreover , we emphasize the strength of weak ties by showing that when a social group has a different attitude towards homophily compared to all other groups , it ends up being the most central in the network .",
    "in particular , we show that the _ structural holes _ created in extremely homophilic networks represent a potential source of bridging capital for  open - minded \" social groups ; non - homophilic individuals can fill these holes and broker interactions at the interface between different groups , which allows them to be the most central agents , even if they are neither the most popular nor represent a majority type in the network .",
    "furthermore , we show that in extremely non - homophilic societies , homophilic social groups are the most central ; that is , despite the absence of cross - group structural holes , homophilic agents reside in the center of the network , acting as an _ information hub _ or a _ dominant coalition _ , through which information diffusion is controlled .",
    "+      to the best of the authors knowledge , none of the network formation models in literature have studied the emerging social capital associated with endogenously formed networks .",
    "qualitative studies on social capital by contemporary sociologists such as coleman , bourdieu , lin , putnam , portes and granovetter can be found in @xcite-@xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these studies give qualitative definitions for the social capital in general ( not necessarily networked ) societies along with some hypotheses about its emergence in different societies , and they support their hypotheses on the basis of historical and experimental evidence . moreover , empirical and qualitative studies on the social capital in online social networks ( osn ) were carried out in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these works have given qualitative insights into the emergence of social capital in osns mainly based on data , e.g. the number of followers and followees of a user on twitter , the frequency of interaction and message exchange among users in facebook , etc .",
    "all these works do not come up with mathematical models for the emerging social capital in evolving social networks , thus they neither offer a concrete understanding and explanation for the micro - foundations of social capital , nor offer a counterfactual analysis for different scenarios of network evolution .    while no mathematical model has studied emergent social capital in networks ,",
    "there exists a voluminous literature focusing on network formation models .",
    "previous works on network formation can be divided into three categories : networks formed based on _ random events _",
    "@xcite , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite-@xcite , @xcite , networks formed based on _ strategic decisions _",
    "@xcite-@xcite , @xcite , and empirical models distilled by mining networks data @xcite-@xcite , @xcite , @xcite-@xcite , @xcite . while a fairly large literature has been devoted to developing mathematical models for network formation , a much smaller literature attempts to interpret and understand how networks evolve over time , how individual agents affect the characteristics of such networks , and the  value \" of social networking conceptualized in terms of social capital .",
    "probabilistic models based on random events are generative models that are concerned with constructing networks that mimic real - world social networks . in @xcite-@xcite , agents get connected in a pure probabilistic manner in order to realize some degree distribution @xcite , or according to a _ preferential attachment _ rule @xcite@xcite . while such models can capture the basic structural properties of social networks , they fail to explain why and how such properties emerge over time .    in contrast , strategic network formation models such as those in @xcite-@xcite , and our previous works in @xcite@xcite , can offer an explanation for why certain network topologies emerge as an equilibrium of a network formation game .",
    "however , these results are limited to studying network _",
    "stability _ and _ efficiency _ , and provide only very limited insight into the dynamics and evolution of networks .",
    "moreover , although mining empirical data can help in building algorithms for detecting communities @xcite-@xcite , predicting agents popularity @xcite , or identifying agents in a network @xcite , it is of limited use in understanding how networks form and evolve .",
    "we construct a model for a growing and evolving social network .",
    "time is discrete .",
    "one _ agent _ is born at each moment of time ; we index agents by their birth dates @xmath0 .",

    "theorem 1 says that when the agents are _ not _ homophilic , there is no uncertainty in the ego network formation process , then both the number of links and the eft are equal to @xmath141 almost surely .",
    "deterministic \" eft is independent of the network , and only depends on the agent s gregariousness .",
    "that is , if @xmath135 , then an agent s journey in the network is determined by how it values linking , and not by the network structure or the actions of others .",
    "if agents are more _ sociable _ , i.e. are more gregarious , then they will spend more time searching for followees , yet this time is deterministic and only depends on parameters that are determined by the agent and not the network . on the other hand ,",
    "if agents are extremely homophilic , then the agent s journey in the network will depend randomly on meetings with other agents with whom they do not form any links .",
    "it is clear from theorem 1 that the eeft of extremely homophilic agents depends on the type distribution and opportunism , in addition to gregariousness .",
    "we emphasize these dependencies in the following corollary .    _",
    "( gregarious agents and minorities search for followees longer , opportunistic agents search shorter ) _ if @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , and @xmath145 , then for an agent @xmath18 born in an asymptotically large network we have that @xmath146 @xmath147 @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the eft associated with the exogenous parameter tuple @xmath150    see appendix d.    note that stochastic dominance implies domination in mean .",
    "that is , if @xmath151 then @xmath152 moreover , stochastic dominance implies domination of the expectation of any increasing function of the eft ; if the bonding capital is a decreasing function of the eft , then one can infer the impact of the exogenous parameters on the expected bonding capital directly from the results of corollary 1 .",
    "corollary 1 says that in homophilic societies , the eft of a social group _ increases ( in the sense of fosd ) _ as the gregariousness of that group increases .",
    "this is intuitive since the more followees an agent is willing to follow , the longer it takes to find those followees .",
    "moreover , agents belonging to minorities are expected to spend more time in the link formation process .",
    "this is again intuitive since when the fraction of similar - type agents in the population is small , each agent would need to meet a longer sequence of agents in order to find similar - type followees .",
    "finally , the eft decreases in the sense of fosd as structural opportunism increases . this is because once the agent becomes attached to a network component of similar - type agents , it is then better to be opportunistic and keep meeting the followees of followees who are guaranteed to be similar - type agents , rather than meeting strangers with uncertain types . in this",
    "context , structural opportunism captures what mayhew calls",
    " structuralist \" homophily effects in @xcite , and what kossinets and watts refer to as  induced homophily \" in @xcite , which corresponds to the fact that similar - type agents are more likely to  meet \" when agents are opportunistic .",
    "note that the meeting process , encoded in the structural opportunism , plays a more crucial role for  minor \" types in homophilic societies as we show in the following corollary .",
    "if @xmath142 , then for an agent @xmath18 born in an asymptotically large network , the following is satisfied :    1 .   if agent @xmath18 belongs to a minor type ( @xmath153 ) , then we have that @xmath154 and @xmath155 2 .",
    "if agent @xmath18 belongs to a major type ( @xmath156 ) , then for every @xmath157 we have that @xmath158    thus , if minor types _ exploit _ their current connections to form new links , their eeft becomes inversely proportional to their population size @xmath159 with an _ additive _ gregariousness parameter , whereas if the minor types _ explore _ the network by meeting strangers , their eeft becomes inversely proportional to their population size @xmath159 with a _ multiplicative _ gregariousness parameter .",
    "therefore , minor types need to be more opportunistic for their eeft to decrease . on the other hand , agents belonging to a ",
    "major \" type with @xmath160 have an eeft @xmath161 regardless of their level of opportunism .",
    "thus , the eft of major types is less affected by the meeting process .",
    "fig . 3 reports simulations that illustrate the results of theorem 1 and corollary 1 . in fig .",
    "3(a ) , we can see that the eeft in an extremely homophilic society is greater than that of a non - homophilic society , and as the network grows , the eeft for homophilic agents converges to the value specified by theorem 1 . in fig .",
    "3(b ) , we plot the cdf of the eft for homophilic agents with different levels of opportunism , and we can see that the eft of non opportunistic agents stochastically dominates that of opportunistic agents .",
    "similarly , we demonstrate the impact of the type distribution in fig .",
    "3(c ) .      in the previous subsection",
    "we have characterized the time needed for individuals to form their local ego networks , and thus realize a bonding capital .",
    "a common aspect in the definitions of bonding capital by putnam @xcite , bourdieu @xcite , coleman @xcite , fischer @xcite , and cobb @xcite , is that it corresponds to the _ social support _ that individuals obtain through networking .",
    "social support includes companionship , information exchange , emotional and instrumental support . in our model ,",
    "agents derive social support from their followees ; and such support is larger when the agent and its followees are of the same type , i.e. if an agent connects with same - type agents , they will acquire more relevant information @xcite .",
    "thus , the types of agents in an agent s ego network determine its bonding capital .",
    "based on this , we consider an agent s utility function , which represents the agent s net aggregate linking benefit , as an operational measure for the bonding capital accumulated by that agent .",
    "the bonding capital accumulated by an agent @xmath18 at time @xmath1 is simply measured by its utility @xmath162 , whereas the bonding capital of type-@xmath27 agent is measured by their average utility @xmath163 and the bonding capital of all agents in the network is @xmath164 .",
    "we note that a larger ego network does not imply greater social or informational support .",
    "in fact , an agent might establish an ego network that comprises many different - type agents and will then have to pay the cost ( time , effort , etc ) to maintain the links with them while getting little social / informational support .",
    "for instance , a twitter user who follows many accounts spreading information that is not relevant to the user s interests leads to low bonding capital : the user then spends time following such accounts but gets low informational benefits .",
    "the utility of each agent in a steady - state ego network is a measure for the support that an individual can obtain from other individuals in his local personal network . in the following theorem",
    ", we show that maximum bonding capital is only achieved in societies with extreme homophily .",
    "( homophily induces structural holes ) assume @xmath165 . in order",
    "that the total average utility @xmath166 converges to the optimal value @xmath167 as the network grows without bound it is necessary and sufficient that @xmath168 if this is the case then the network at any time step will be disconnected almost surely and have at least @xmath26 non - singleton components .",
    "see appendix e.    if all agents are extremely homophilic , then a disconnected network that maximizes the achieved utility always emerges , and such a network is always disconnected even with the limited observability of the meeting process .",
    "a disconnected network obviously entails _ structural holes _ as defined by burt @xcite@xcite : same - type agents form connected components that do not communicate with other types of agents , thus different types of agents do not exchange ideas and information .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "4 , the optimal total average utility is only achieved when agents are extremely intolerant towards different - type agents .",
    "thus , maximizing the bonding capital in homophilic societies implies the presence of structural holes . for any network with non - extremely homophilic agents",
    ", the limited observability of agents dictated by the meeting process allows the agents to fill the network s structural holes . in other words , what makes the network connected is that not all similar - type agents observe each other at each time step , but they can potentially meet different - type agents with which they decide to connect . if the meeting process allows unlimited observability , i.e. @xmath169 , then the agents will always converge to a disconnected network with @xmath26 non - singleton components .",
    "the major conclusion drawn from this section is that homophily leads agents to reside in more homogeneous ego networks , but also leads the agents to wait longer in order to establish their ego networks , and induces structural holes in the global network structure .",
    "thus , on one hand homophily unifies the local structure of the network by gathering people with similar traits together , but on the other hand it divides the global network structure since dissimilar social groups become weakly connected .",
    "this creates another potential source of capital , namely a _",
    "bridging capital _ , which we discuss in section 5 .",
    "since in our model we consider directed networks , we distinguish between conventional bonding capital , which is realized by homogenous networks of like - minded people that provides social support for the individual , and _ popularity capital _ , which corresponds to the individual s influence in the network that is gained by supporting others .",
    "popularity is an important form of social capital that represents an individual s influence on a social group ; an individual s ability to spread opinions , information , and ideas ; and also an individual s acquisition for group support .",
    "for instance , users of twitter acquire popularity measured by the number of followers , which allows them to express opinions , problems , and experiences , and acquire emotional support provided by their online support groups ( followers ) .",
    "followers retweet the tweets posted by users , which allows those users to spread their ideas and opinions @xcite .",
    "similarly , the popularity of researchers measured by the number of citations or the h - index allows those researchers to promote for new research ideas and directions . in this section",
    "we study popularity capital and connect it to preferential attachment , which is a central concept in network science .",
    "the popularity of agent @xmath18 at time @xmath1 is simply given by @xmath20 .",

    "all of these previous papers model agents as forming links only once ; in our model , agents may form links many times .",
    "more importantly , all of these previous models _",
    "impose _ preferential attachment as a behavioral rule ( so network growth is viewed as a conventional _ stochastic urn process _ ) ; in our model , preferential attachment _ emerges endogenously_.    to fix ideas , we first provide a general definition of preferential attachment that will be adopted in what follows .",

    ". such result , which agrees with the qualitative study of ibarra in @xcite , is again in a striking contrast with the popularity capital acquisition where the type distribution had no significant impact on the agents popularity growth rates .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "8(c ) shows that structural opportunism decreases centrality , which is again in contrast with the popularity acquisition experience where structural opportunism was allowing for the emergence of preferential attachment .",
    "0.325        0.525     from the simulation results in fig .",
    "8 , we conclude that _ homophily creates inequality in the acquisition of bridging capital _ , and the different behaviors and norms of different social groups lead to the emergence of different forms of capital .",
    "the way that inequality is created in those forms of capital can have very different dependencies on the behaviors of the social groups .",
    "when agents in a homophilic group are very sociable , every agent is likely to be popular but not central .",
    "that is , socialization increases the bonding capital , but decreases the bridging capital .",
    "moreover , minorities have the same chance as majorities to become popular , yet they have less chances to be central .    the results in fig . 8 and the discussion above",
    "are concerned with the centrality of agents within their social groups . however , a more interesting form of centrality is the one that arises from bridging heterogeneous social groups .",
    "in fact , this is the form of social capital that burt and putnam have extensively studied in @xcite and @xcite . in the following subsection",
    ", we introduce a new phenomenon that provides insights into the interplay between centrality and homophily .      in this subsection",
    ", we study a striking phenomenon that arises from the interplay between homophily and centrality .",
    "in particular , we show via simulations that when a social group possesses different homophilic tendencies compared to all other social groups , they end up being the most central group , and thus accrue the largest bridging capital .",
    "that is , in an extremely homophilic society , non - homophilic agents bridge segregated social groups , and thus become the most central and gain access to diverse sources of information . on the other hand ,",
    "a homophilic social group in a non - homophilic society ends up being the most central as they form a highly connected core of the global network structure , which represent an information hub through which all individuals are bridged .      as first pointed out by granovetter in @xcite , weak ties ( the ties between individuals of different types ) have strength as they bridge different segregated social groups",
    ". opinions , beliefs , and ideas are more homogeneous within than between groups , so individuals connected across groups are more exposed to alternative ways of thinking and behaving . in other words , brokerage across the structural holes between homophilic groups provides a vision of new options that are otherwise unseen , which stimulates new ideas and innovation , and also allows agents to control information flow across different groups @xcite .",
    "thus brokerage creates a social capital , namely a bridging capital , and centrality in such case is gained by agents who link the segregated homophilic groups .",
    "0.3        0.3        0.3     in fig . 9",
    ", we demonstrate the interplay between bonding and bridging capital in a network that exhibits structural holes .",
    "we carry out a monte carlo simulation by simulating 1000 instantiations of the network and plot the average utility and betweenness centrality of each type of agents in the network .",
    "we assume that the network has 3 types of agents , where type-1 and type-2 agents are extremely homophilic , whereas type-3 agents have a homophily index of @xmath227 .",
    "since type-1 and type-2 agents are extremely homophilic , their bonding capital is maximized , yet both types are disconnected , which creates an opportunity for harvesting bridging capital by type-3 agents since such a type can bridge the two disconnected communities .",
    "the ability of type-3 agents to acquire bridging capital depends on their meeting process , i.e. the extent to which they explore the network .",
    "if non - homophilic individuals are not exploring the network , then they will end up in a peripheral position in the network , and may not construct their ego networks in finite time ( recall lemma 1 ) . fig .",
    "9(a ) and 9(b ) depict the impact of the meeting process on the bridging capital acquired by non - homophilic agents in a homophilic society .",
    "it is clear from both figures that there is a tension between the bonding capital ( expressed in terms of the average utility ) , and the bridging capital ( expressed in terms of the average centrality ) .",
    "that is to say , homophilic type-1 and type-2 agents acquire higher utility since they enjoy more homogeneous ego networks than type-3 agents .",
    "however , when @xmath228 , type-3 agents are more central in the network as they broker the interface between type-1 and type-2 social groups .",
    "contrarily , when @xmath229 , type-3 agents acquire less bonding and bridging capital as they do not explore the network , thus they can not bridge segregated groups , albeit being non - homophilic .    fig",
    "10 depicts the network structure at @xmath230 for various meeting processes . in fig .",
    "10(a ) , we see that when type-3 agents ( red colored ) are fully opportunistic , they end up being either marginalized ( acquire a peripherial position ) or unsatisfied ( never forms a satisfactory ego network ) . when the network exploration rate increases , we see in fig .",
    "10(b ) that only a fraction of non - homophilic agents are prepherial at any time step , yet an intermediate community of such agents emerges and it bridges the otherwise segregated social groups . when @xmath229 , we see in fig .",
    "10(c ) that all non - homophilic agents will reside in the central community and will acquire a central position .",
    "such result provides the following interesting insight : it is not enough for individuals to be non - homophilic , tolerant , or open - minded in order to harvest the bridging capital , but it is essential for them to explore the network structure such that they meet diverse types of agents .",
    "thus , in a society where the meeting process ; reflected by policies , norms , regulations , geographical constraints or rules ; hinders network exploration , then the existence of non - homophilic individuals does not guarantee that structural holes will be filled . in the following theorem",
    ", we provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for any network to be connected .",
    "( network connectedness ) an asymptotically large network is connected almost surely , i.e. @xmath231 , if and only if there exists at least one type of agents @xmath232 with @xmath233 and @xmath234 .",
    "see appendix m.    theorem 6 says that the existence of non - homophilic type of agents that explore the network with any non - zero rate will guarantee network connectedness .",
    "the condition of @xmath234 follows from our assumption that agents have infinite lifetimes .",
    "if agents have finite lifetimes , then a threshold on @xmath112 will decide the network connectedness .",
    "that is to say , open - minded individuals will have a threshold on the minimum rate of network exploration that is a function of their lifetime , beyond which they will not be able to fill the structural holes and acquire the largest bridging capital .",
    "thus , non - homophilic agents , who can be thought of as being  tolerant \" or  open - minded \" individuals , can bridge segregated social groups and become the most central in the network when their meeting process involves exploring the network .",
    "the literature argues that the centrality of non - homophilic ( or tolerant and open - minded ) individuals play an important role in many networks .",
    "for instance , in the context of citation networks , leydesdorff proposes betweenness centrality as a measure of a journal s  interdisciplinarity \" .",
    "in addition to the _ impact factor _ which is a measure of a journal s influence , centrality of a journal indicates the role it plays in promoting innovative and interdisciplinary research , which creates a social capital in the research citation and collaboration networks @xcite@xcite . moreover , burt emphasizes the role of centrality in the diffusion of information @xcite , and the creation of new ideas as a result to the exposure to non redundant sources of information @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that bridging capital not only leads to egocentric returns to individuals , but also creates a shared value for the network : it stimulates innovative and interdisciplinary research ideas , and allows for the diffusion of information along the global network structure .          in the previous subsection",
    ", we have shown that non - homophilic agents in a homophilic society acquire the most central network positions and thus attain the highest bridging capital . in this subsection , we show that in the reciprocal scenario where there is one homophilic type of agents in a non - homophilic society , homophilic agents end up being more central than others . in fig .",
    "11 , we plot the average utility and betweenness centrality of 3 types of agents forming a network , where types 1 and 2 agents are extremely non - homophilic , whereas type 3 agents are extremely homophilic .",
    "it can be observed that the average centrality of type 3 agents dominates that of types 1 and 2 .",
    "this is because type 3 agents tend to connect to each other , thus forming a _",
    "dominant coalition _ or an _ information hub _ that resides in the core of the network .",
    "the term  dominant coalition \" was coined by brass in @xcite to describe same - gender highly connected influential agents in an organization s interaction network . unlike the result of the previous subsection , homophilic central agents in a society dominated by non - homophilic types of agents do not bridge structural holes in the network , but rather form a densely connected sub - network through which information is disseminated over the entire network topology .",
    "in the context of citation networks , this result predicts that if types corresponds to journals , then a journal that is highly cited and at the same time maintains a self - citation rate that is significantly higher than other journals is likely to form an information hub in a network of papers .",
    "12 illustrates the formation of an information hub by the extremely homophilic agents in a non - homophilic society , where it can be seen that the type-3 agents form a core sub - network that resides in the center of the global network topology .     and @xmath235 .",
    "the extremely homophilic type-3 agents form a dominant coalition that resides in the core of the network.,width=3 ]",
    "in this paper , we presented a micro - founded mathematical model of the emerging social capital in evolving social networks . in our model , the evolution of the network and of social capital are driven by exogenous and endogenous processes , which are influenced by the extent to which individuals are homophilic , structurally opportunistic , socially gregarious and by the distribution of agents types in the society .",
    "we focused on three different forms of endogenously emerging social capital : bonding , popularity , and bridging capital , and showed how these different forms of capital depend on the exogenous parameters .",
    "bonding capital is maximized in extremely homophilic societies , yet extreme homophily creates structural holes that hinder communications across network components .",
    "popularity capital leads to preferential attachment due to the agents structural opportunism , which offers agents a cumulative advantage in popularity capital acquisition .",
    "homophily creates inequality in the popularity capital ; more gregarious types of agents are more likely to become popular .",
    "however , in homophilic societies , individuals who belong to less gregarious , less opportunistic , or major types are likely to be more central in the network and thus acquire a bridging capital .",
    "finally , we studied a striking phenomenon that arises from the interplay between homophily and centrality .",
    "in particular , we showed that when a social group that possesses different homophilic tendencies compared to all other social groups , they end up being the most central group , and thus accrue the largest bridging capital .",
    "from ( [ eq221 ] ) , we know that the exogenous homophily index for type-@xmath27 agents is given by @xmath236 which can be rewritten as @xmath237 the exogenous homophily index can be further rearranged as @xmath238 thus , @xmath96 is obtained by finding the set of followees @xmath239 that maximizes @xmath240 .",
    "note that for an agent @xmath18 , the achieved utility function is given by @xmath241 due to the concavity of the utility function , it follows that for any two followee sets @xmath239 and @xmath242 , if @xmath243 then @xmath244 .",
    "this can be easily shown by computing the number of possible same - type followees given a certain number of different - type followees .",
    "for instance , assume that @xmath245 and @xmath246 can take non - integer values , and let @xmath247 thus , for any valid value of @xmath246 , the value of @xmath245 is given by @xmath248 thus , @xmath245 is a ( weakly ) decreasing function of @xmath246 , and maximizing @xmath240 entails maximizing the number of different - type followees @xmath246 .",
    "since the utility function is concave , and the marginal benefit of adding a different - type followee is always less than that from adding a similar - type followee ( which follows from the assumption of @xmath249 ) , then the maximum number of different - type followees in agent @xmath18 s ego network is equal to the number of different - type followees agent @xmath18 can link with given that it is not linked to any similar - type followee .",
    "thus , based on the definitions in ( [ eq301 ] ) and ( [ eq302 ] ) , the maximum number of different - type followees is @xmath250 , and the corresponding number of similar - type followees is @xmath251 .",
    "such followee set materializes for any realization of the meeting process @xmath252 where @xmath253 , i.e. agent @xmath18 meets a  satisfactory \" number of different - type followees first , and then meets the first similar - type followee .",
    "the exogenous homophily index for type-@xmath27 agents is then given by @xmath254 where @xmath255 can be computed as follows @xmath256 with @xmath257 and @xmath247 similarly , @xmath255 can be obtained as follows @xmath258 where @xmath259    fig .",
    "11 shows an exemplary utility function with a corresponding exogenous homophily index of @xmath260 , which is attained if the agent meets @xmath261 different - type agents first , and then starts linking only with same - type agents .",
    "we start by showing that for any agent @xmath18 , if @xmath262 and @xmath263 , then @xmath264 .",
    "first , since @xmath265 then agent @xmath18 forms a link with the first agent it meets regardless of its type , i.e. @xmath266 for any @xmath267 .",
    "after that , since @xmath262 , then agent @xmath18 keeps meeting agents in the followees of followees choice set @xmath268 after it forms the first link .",
    "let @xmath269 be the set of type-@xmath24 followees of followees .",
    "thus , one possible event that can lead to an agent getting socially unsatisfied is that @xmath67 becomes an empty set in each time step .",
    "therefore , the probability that agent @xmath18 gets socially unsatisfied can be lower bounded as follows @xmath270 the inequality in ( [ eqlowbound ] ) follows from the fact that there are other events that can lead to social unsatisfaction .",
    "however , it suffices to show that @xmath271 in order to prove that @xmath264 .",
    "note that @xmath272 can be lower bounded as follows @xmath273 @xmath274 each agent of type other than @xmath24 have a non - zero probability of having no type-@xmath24 agents in their followees set . to see why this is true , consider any agent @xmath19 with type @xmath275 .",
    "such an agent can have a followee set that contains no type-@xmath24 agents with a non - zero probability , which can happen when agent @xmath19 meets @xmath276 strangers in sequence , and all such agents turn out to be type-@xmath38 agents .",
    "such event happens with a probability that is lower bounded as follows @xmath277 which is always positive for @xmath278 .",
    "we further show that even for @xmath279 , any agent @xmath19 has a positive probability for not connecting to any type-@xmath24 agent .",
    "for instance , agent @xmath19 can initially connect to a type-@xmath38 agent , say agent @xmath27 , which happens with a probability of @xmath280 agent @xmath27 in turn may have connected initially to another type-@xmath38 agent , and such an agent may also have connected initially to another type-@xmath38 agent , and so on .",
    "thus , if at each time step agent @xmath19 meets its type-@xmath38 followee of followee whom its followee has met initially in the network , then agent @xmath19 can end up being connected to a set of exclusively same - type agents .",
    "it can be easily shown that this happens with a probability that is lower bounded by @xmath281 since agent @xmath18 can initially link to a different - type agent , and since any different - type agent can have a set of followees with no type-@xmath24 agents , it follows that the lower bound on @xmath272 is greater than zero , thus @xmath282 .",
    "now we prove the converse , and show that if @xmath264 , then @xmath263 and @xmath262 .",
    "first , since @xmath264 , then @xmath283 , i.e. agent @xmath18 must add at least one similar - type followee in order to get socially unsatisfied , and linking with @xmath284 different - type followees does not suffice to saturate the utility function and terminate the meeting process , thus @xmath285 . now assume that @xmath286 . in this case ,",
    "agent @xmath18 forms its first link only when it meets a similar - type agent , and after that it meets a similar - type agent picked from @xmath268 , or meets an agent with an uncertain type picked uniformly at random from the network . at each time step after agent @xmath18",
    "forms its first link , the probability that it meets a similar - type agent is given by @xmath287 which for a large @xmath1 converges to @xmath288 which is always non - zero for any value of @xmath157 .",
    "thus , an agent with @xmath286 has a non - zero probability to meet a similar - type agent at each time step , which implies that @xmath289 and @xmath290 .",
    "therefore , @xmath264 implies that @xmath263 .",
    "moreover , we know that any agent with @xmath291 will experience the following meeting process in a large enough network @xmath292 which is lower bounded by @xmath293 since @xmath294 , any agent with @xmath291 has a non - zero probability for meeting a similar - type agent at each time step , which means that such an agent is not socially unsatisfied in the almost sure sense .",
    "thus , @xmath264 implies that @xmath262 .",
    "we divide this proof into two parts .",
    "first , we prove that for non - homophilic societies , the eft of an agent @xmath18 is equal to @xmath141 .",
    "next , we show that in homophilic societies , the distribution of efts for the agents in a large network converges to a steady - state distribution . + * eft for non - homophilic societies : * + recall that the exogenous homophily index of an agent @xmath18 is given by @xmath295 we start by studying the case when @xmath296 . from ( [ b1 ] ) , we know that if @xmath296 , then @xmath297 which means that @xmath298 , i.e. agent @xmath18 forms a link with any agent it meets over time as long as its utility function is not yet saturated",
    ". therefore , at any date @xmath299 we have @xmath300 thus , agent @xmath18 forms a link with all the agents it meets until its utility function is saturated , which happens after @xmath141 time steps almost surely , i.e. @xmath301 the eft of a non - homophilic agent @xmath18 is independent of the network structure and the types of agents it meets , i.e. @xmath302 the eft of agent @xmath18 is equal to @xmath141 almost surely since agent @xmath18 meets other agents at a constant rate and forms links with them regardless of their types .",

    "agent @xmath18 forms a link with the agent it meets if and only if the agent it meets is a same - type agent and agent @xmath18 s utility function is not saturated , thus each agent forms exactly @xmath141 links .",
    "the rest of the proof is organized as follows : we first derive the probability that an agent forms a link in a given time step , and then we show that for a large network , this probability becomes independent of the network topology , which implies that the ego network formation process converges to a stationary process .    in the following ,",
    "we derive the probability that an agent forms a link in a given time step .",
    "note that the probability that an agent @xmath18 forms a link at a given time step conditioned on the current step graph ( current network topology ) and the agent it meets can be written as @xmath305 from ( [ thm1eq1 ] ) , and using bayes rule , the probability that agent @xmath18 forms a link at time @xmath1 conditioned on the current step graph is given by @xmath306 note that the meeting process of agent @xmath18 goes throught two stages ( see section 2 ) . upon its arrival , and until it becomes attached to the network by forming its first link , agent @xmath18 meets agents picked uniformly at random from the network , and it forms its first link only if it meets a type-@xmath24 agent , therefore , for @xmath307 , ( [ thm1eq2 ] ) can be written as @xmath308 after agent @xmath18 becomes attached to the network ( i.e. @xmath309 ) , it starts meeting other agents picked from two choice sets : the set of strangers @xmath310 , and the set of followees of followees @xmath268 .",
    "we know from the definition of the meeting process in section 2 that the probability that agent @xmath18 meets a type-@xmath24 agent is given by @xmath311 @xmath312 @xmath313 @xmath314 which can be simplified as follows @xmath311 @xmath315 @xmath316 the probability that the choice set @xmath268 becomes empty at any time step can be expressed as follows .",
    "first , note that if the event @xmath317 happens , then agent @xmath18 should have been connected initially to an agent that has not yet constructed its ego network , i.e. @xmath318 if @xmath18 has formed its first link at time @xmath319 .",
    "this is because otherwise we will have @xmath320 , which implies that @xmath321 at every time step . at any point of time",
    "@xmath322 , the probability that the choice set @xmath268 becomes empty is equal to the probability that @xmath318 and the probability that the new linking actions of agents @xmath18 and @xmath323 has not led to the emergence of new followees of followees .",
    "therefore , we can bound @xmath324 as follows @xmath325 that is , the probability that the followees of followees choice set of agent @xmath18 becomes empty is always less than the probability that agent @xmath18 initially links to an agent with an unsatisfied ego network .",
    "therefore , the probability of forming a link at any time step conditioned on the current network topology is given by ( [ eqlong ] ) .",
    "@xmath326    @xmath327    note that the expressions in ( [ eqlong ] ) depend on the actual realization of the graph process at time @xmath1 , i.e. the step graph @xmath2 . in the following ,",
    "we show that this dependency vanishes when the network is asymptotically large .",
    "first , since any type-@xmath27 agent has @xmath328 , then all the followees of followees for an agent @xmath18 has a type @xmath24 , i.e. @xmath329 . moreover , in a large network we have @xmath330 , which is equivalent to @xmath331 .",
    "since all agents are extremely homophilic , they have finite efts ( recall lemma 1 ) , which means that @xmath332 .",

    "furthermore , we have that @xmath336 this leads to the expressions in ( [ eqlong3 ] ) .",
    "it is clear from ( [ eqlong3 ] ) that for a large network , the probability of taking a link formation decision at any time step depends only on the current number of followees of agent @xmath18 .",
    "thus , linking decisions depend only on agent @xmath18 s ego network , and are independent on the global network structure .",
    "let @xmath337 for @xmath338 , be the waiting time between forming link @xmath339 and link @xmath19 by agent @xmath18 , and @xmath340 be the waiting time between forming the first link and agent @xmath18 s birth date .",
    "thus , the eft is given by @xmath341 .",
    "note that @xmath340 is the number of agents met by agent @xmath18 before it forms its first link .",
    "therefore , when agent @xmath18 is singleton , every meeting will result in the formation of the first link with a probability of @xmath159 independent on the previous meetings , which means that @xmath340 is a _ geometric random variable _ with a success probability of @xmath159 , and @xmath342 .",
    "moreover , for a large network , the probability of forming a link at time step @xmath1 is @xmath343 thus , after it forms its first link , agent @xmath18 needs to form @xmath344 links , and the probability of forming a link at any time step is @xmath345 , which is independent of the network topology and the history of actions of agent @xmath18 .",

    "<S> a social network confers benefits and advantages on individuals ( and on groups ) ; the literature refers to these benefits and advantages as _ </S>",
    "<S> social capital_. an individual s social capital depends on its position in the network and on the shape of the network  but positions in the network and the shape of the network are determined endogenously and change as the network forms and evolves . </S>",
    "<S> this paper presents a micro - founded mathematical model of the evolution of a social network and of the social capital of individuals within the network . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the network and of social capital are driven by exogenous and endogenous processes  birth , meeting , linking  that have both random and deterministic components . </S>",
    "<S> these processes are influenced by the extent to which individuals are _ homophilic _ ( prefer others of their own type ) , _ structurally opportunistic _ </S>",
    "<S> ( prefer neighbors of neighbors to strangers ) , _ socially gregarious _ </S>",
    "<S> ( desire more or fewer connections ) and by the _ distribution of types _ in the society . in the analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we identify different kinds of social capital : _ bonding capital _ refers to links to others ; _ popularity capital _ refers to links from others ; _ bridging capital _ refers to connections between others . </S>",
    "<S> we show that each form of capital plays a different role and is affected differently by the characteristics of the society . </S>",
    "<S> bonding capital is created by forming a circle of connections ; homophily increases bonding capital because it makes this circle of connections more homogeneous . </S>",
    "<S> popularity capital leads to _ preferential attachment _ : individuals who become popular tend to become more and more popular because others are more likely to link to them . </S>",
    "<S> homophily creates inequality in the popularity capital attained by different social groups ; more gregarious types of agents are more likely to become popular . </S>",
    "<S> however , in homophilic societies , individuals who belong to less gregarious , less opportunistic , or major types are likely to be more _ central _ in the network and thus acquire a bridging capital . and , while extreme homophily maximizes an individual s bonding capital , it also creates _ structural holes _ in the network , which hinder the exchange of ideas and information across social groups . </S>",
    "<S> such structural holes represent a potential source of bridging capital : non - homophilic ( tolerant or open - minded ) individuals can fill these holes and broker interactions at the interface between different groups .    </S>",
