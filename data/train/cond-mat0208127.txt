    "block copolymers ( bcp ) are polymeric systems where each polymer chain is composed of several chemically distinct homopolymer blocks , connected together by a covalent bond . at high temperatures ,",
    "bcp have a disordered phase , while at low temperatures , the macroscopic phase separation is hindered because the two ( or more ) immiscible sub - chains can not be detached from each other as they try to phase separate . hence , bcp phase separate into a variety of micro - ordered structures , with characteristic size which depends on the bcp chain length and other system parameters @xcite .",
    "the morphology and structure of the prevailing phase depends on the lengths of constituent sub - chains ( also called blocks ) , the chemical interactions between the blocks , the temperature and the chain architecture .",
    "the bcp micro - domain size ranges from about @xmath0 to several hundreds nanometers .",
    "this fundamental periodicity should be distinguished from the macro - domain size of several micrometers where one ordered phase ( e.g. , a lamellar phase ) breaks into many domains ( or grains ) each having of a different orientation and separated by grain boundaries .",

    "moreover , the interplay between flexibility and toughness can be controlled by temperature .",
    "different chain architecture ( ring or star - like ) may lead to novel mechanical and flow properties @xcite .",
    "in addition , bcps have many industrial uses because the length scales involved are smaller or comparable to the wavelength of light .",

    "alignment of confined lamellae by external electric fields is studied in sec .",
    "it is shown that because different polymers have different values of the dielectric constant , the electrostatic energy favors an orientation of lamellae in a direction perpendicular to the confining electrodes .",

    "the bcp is confined by one or two flat , chemically patterned surfaces .",

    "when a melt in the lamellar phase ( below odt ) is confined in a thin film , the morphology is dictated by a complex interplay between the natural periodicity and the imposed film thickness .",
    "in this section we describe the ordering of lamellar bcps confined by one or two surfaces . the phase behavior of thin bcp films in the lamellar phase subject to _ uniform _ surface fields has been investigated numerically using self - consistent field ( scf ) theory @xcite and monte - carlo simulations @xcite , and was found to consist of parallel , perpendicular and mixed lamellar phase denoted @xmath76 , l@xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively .",

    "however , if the spacing @xmath79 between the surfaces is incommensurate with the lamellar periodicity , or the incompatibility @xmath34 is increased , a perpendicular orientation is favored @xcite .    in the treatment given below , a new effect can be observed when the surfaces are taken to be non - uniform , `` striped '' , with regions of alternating preferences to the a and b blocks [ see fig .  1 ( c ) ] .",

    "the main effect of increasing the surface periodicity @xmath80 with respect to @xmath90 is to stabilize tilted lamellae , with increasing tilt angle .",
    "note that even for @xmath102 [ fig .",
    "5a ] yielding no tilt , the perpendicular lamellae have a different structure close to the surface as is induced by the surface pattern .",
    "although the surface interactions are assumed to be strictly local , the connectivity of the chains causes surface - bound distortions to propagate into the bulk of the bcp melt .",
    "in particular , this is a strong effect in the weak - segregation regime we are considering .",
    "so far in this section we have considered the semi - infinite problem of a bcp melt confined by one patterned surface .",
    "it is of experimental and theoretical interest to study thin films of bcp when they are confined between a heterogeneous ( patterned ) surface and a second chemically homogeneous surface .",
    "this situation is encountered when a thin bcp is spread on a patterned surface .",
    "the second interface is the film / air interface and is homogeneous .",

    "this `` t - junction '' morphology , shown in fig .",
    "6 , has perpendicular lamellae extending from the patterned surface .",
    "the homogeneous field at the opposite surface favors a parallel orientation of the lamellae .",
    "the crossover region between the two orientations is found in the middle of the film , and its morphology depends on temperature ( the @xmath34 parameter ) .",
    "the effect of the homogeneous field is evident , as parallel ordering extends from the top surface .",
    "we see here that strong enough modulated surface fields stabilize the tilted lamellar phases and , in particular , the @xmath78 phase .    in the discussion above we have considered ordering mechanisms where the interaction of the polymers with the confining surfaces is mediated to regions far from the surfaces because of chain connectivity .",
    "we now turn to discuss orientation of bcp films in presence of external electric fields .",
    "this is a bulk ordering mechanism that does not originate from surface interactions .",
    "a well known mechanism to cause orientation or structural changes in polarized media is the `` dielectric mechanism '' .",
    "this effect is based on the fact that when a material with inhomogeneous dielectric constant is placed in an electric field @xmath114 , there is an electrostatic free energy penalty for having dielectric interfaces perpendicular to the field @xcite .",
    "thus , a state where @xmath115 is perpendicular to the field @xmath116 is favored . for layered materials such as lamellar bcp phases ,",
    "the strength of this effect is proportional to @xmath117 , where @xmath118 and @xmath119 are the dielectric constants of the two micro - domains , and is enhanced when the difference in polarizabilities is large .",

    "we will then include an electric field and see its influence . for simplicity and brevity of presentation",
    "we assume that the flory parameter @xmath34 does not change on the surface , @xmath120 .",

    "if the surface affinity @xmath123 is sufficiently large , the lamellae will order in a parallel arrangement as was discussed in the previous sections .",

    "depending on the value of @xmath123 , an integer ( @xmath126 ) or half integer ( @xmath127 ) number of lamellae fill the gap between the two surfaces . in the former case",
    "the ordering is symmetric ( the same type of monomers adsorbed onto both surfaces ) , while in the latter it is asymmetric ( a monomers adsorbed on one surface , whereas b monomers adsorbed on the other surface ) .",

    "the minimum of the free energy is obtained by maximizing the capacitance .",
    "since the a- and b - monomers have different dielectric constants , the effect of the electric field is to align the bcp layers parallel to the field , i.e. perpendicular to the surfaces . at a certain field strength",
