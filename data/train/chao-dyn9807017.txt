    "similar restrictions of our theory may arise from the neglect of marginally stable ( bouncing - ball ) orbits . however , all the approximations discussed so far are standard within a semiclassical theory for two - point correlations , and although they can not be rigorously justified , they are sufficient to reproduce most of the available numerical data @xcite .",
    "the most important limitation in this respect is due to the diagonal approximation for systems with time - reversal invariance , @xmath96 .",
    "it is well known that this approximation reproduces only the slope near @xmath97 for systems with a single chaotic cell , and it is not surprising that we observe the same for a two - cell system when we compare ( [ symffscl ] ) to eq .",

    "it is clear that the overshoot of @xmath99 over its asymptotic value , as described by eq .",

    "this overshoot should vanish altogether , leaving the steeper initial rise of the form factor implied by eq .",
    "( [ symffscl ] ) as the only spectral signature of the restricted exchange between the cells .",
    "however , we expect that there exists a continuous crossover , as a function of some parameter , that expresses the degree of symmetry breaking .    a semiclassical approach that extends the above arguments to the case of a weakly broken symmetry has been presented in @xcite .",
    "it is based on the idea that the contributions of a given set of n symmetry - related periodic orbits to the form factor will no longer be n - fold degenerate , but can still be completely included , without resorting to a diagonal approximation within this set .",

    "given that the form factors contain information merely on two - point correlations irrespective of symmetry , it is actually surprising that they can be related , as in eq .",
    "( [ ffdiff ] ) , to a quantity that requires an unambiguous identification of doublets .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that we had to assume in the derivation that the midpoints @xmath128 of the doublets are statistically independent of their splittings @xmath129 , which requires a clear separation of scales between splittings and spacings of doublets .",
    "indeed , eq .  ( [ ffdiff ] ) ceases to be valid for @xmath130 , corresponding to the regime of large @xmath131 .",
    "we do not have any semiclassical access to @xmath132 . in order to nevertheless make some progress",
    ", we shall resort to results of random - matrix theory on the distribution of resonance widths , and argue that the doublet splittings obey a similar distribution .",
    "suppose the channel between the two cells to be replaced by a semi - infinite duct of constant width , so that two single cells remain , each with a small opening that couples its interior to the continuum in the duct .",
    "this situation is illustrated with a symmetric two - cell billiard in fig .",
    "[ hdb - fig ] .",
    "the spectra of the open single cells will then exhibit narrow resonances at roughly the same energies where the corresponding closed two - cell system shows doublets .",
    "it is plausible that the doublet splittings of the two - cell configuration are related to the resonance widths in the single - cell setup , at least in a statistical sense .",
    "indeed , this assumption is often made , e.g. , in nuclear theory , and supported by semiclassical and random - matrix arguments . in short , it is justified by the fact that both quantities , widths and splittings , can be expressed by the same wavefunction overlaps and therefore should obey the same distribution .",
    "here we are interested in the case of very few open channels in the connecting section , since this is required for the formation of narrow doublets . in this limit , we can not expect random - matrix theory to remain valid .",
    "however , taking the point of view of the scattering approach to quantization @xcite , we show in the following paragraphs that there is still a close relation , though not an exact identity , between the respective distributions of widths and splittings .",
    "we shall consider specifically the wavenumber regime where there is just a single open channel in the connecting section .",
    "this case is realized in the majority of the numerical examples below . here , the calculation is particularly straightforward and transparent , because the scattering in the cell is described by a @xmath133 scattering `` matrix '' ( since there is only one opening , all incoming waves leave as reflected waves ) .",
    "as we are interested in isolated narrow resonances , we assume their widths to be small as compared to their separations .",
    "the @xmath134 matrix can then be written in the form @xmath135 where @xmath136 denotes the position of the resonance pole in the complex energy plane , again in units of the mean level spacing .",
