    "the harp experiment arose from the realization that the differential cross - sections of hadron production in the collisions of few gev/_c _ protons with nuclei were known only within a factor of two to three .",
    "consequently , the harp spectrometer was designed to carry out a programme of systematic and precise measurements of hadron production by protons and pions with momenta from 3 to 15  gev/_c_. the experiment was in operation at the cern proton synchrotron in 2001 and 2002 , with a set of stationary targets ranging from hydrogen to lead , including beryllium .",
    "the data from the harp spectrometer can be used , amongst other purposes , for the physics validation of hadron generators that are used in simulation tool kits such as geant4  @xcite .",
    "this is of interest for the correct interpretation of data that will be forthcoming , e.g. , from experiments at the lhc  @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "data are used from the harp large - angle spectrometer that comprised a cylindrical time projection chamber ( tpc ) and an array of resistive plate chambers ( rpcs ) around the tpc .",
    "the purpose of the tpc was the measurement of the transverse momentum @xmath6 and of the polar angle @xmath7 of tracks , and particle identification by d@xmath8/d@xmath9 .",
    "the purpose of the rpcs was a complementary particle identification by time of flight .",
    "the data analysis that underlies the spectra shown in this paper rests on the calibrations of the tpc and the rpcs that our group published in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite . for a more detailed account of our calibration work",
    "we refer to our collection of memos and analysis notes  @xcite .",
    "we recall that we disagree with the calibrations and physics results reported by the ` harp collaboration ' , as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .    with a view to correcting for losses of secondary particles from acceptance cuts , and for migration due to finite detector resolution",
    ", the measurement of tracks in the detector must be simulated with a monte carlo program .",
    "we use the geant4 tool kit for this purpose .",
    "it was at this point that we noticed peculiar structures in the polar - angle spectra of secondary particles generated by geant4 s lhep ` physics list ' that prevented the weighting of generated tracks by smooth functions .",
    "further investigations showed that this is a rather common phenomenon across geant4 s hadronic physics lists .",
    "figure  [ zebraplot ] shows a typical example of an unphysical structure in generated longitudinal momentum @xmath10 versus transverse momentum @xmath6 of secondaries .",
    "since the structure is genuinely connected with the polar angle @xmath7 , it tends to be washed out when integrating over either @xmath10 or @xmath6 . that may explain why  as nearly as we can tell ",
    "these structures were not noticed before .     versus transverse momentum @xmath6 ,",
    "as generated by geant4 s lhep physics list for secondary @xmath11 from the interactions of @xmath0  gev/_c _ beam @xmath11 with beryllium nuclei at rest.,width=340 ]",
    "the geant4 simulation tool kit provides several physics models of hadronic interactions of hadrons with nuclei , and collections of such models , termed physics lists .",
    "the latter are tailored with a view to optimizing performance for specific applications .",
    "table  [ physicslistsoverview ] lists and characterizes a representative selection of physics lists of hadronic interactions in geant4 , together with the used physics models and the energy ranges where the latter are considered to be reliable  @xcite .    in the so - called ` low - energy ' domain ( defined as kinetic energy @xmath8 of the incoming hadron below some @xmath12  gev ) , a modified version of the gheisha package of geant3 is used in many physics lists : the parametrized low - energy model ( ` le_gheisha ' ) .",
    "optionally , for @xmath8 below a few gev , the bertini cascade  @xcite ( ` bert ' ) or the binary cascade  @xcite ( ` bic ' ) models can be enabled , with a view to simulating the cascading of final - state hadrons when they move through nuclear matter . as an alternative to le_gheisha ,",
    "a modified version of the fritiof string fragmentation model  @xcite ( ` ftf ' ) is available .    in the so - called ` high - energy ' domain , mostly the quark ",
    "gluon string model ( ` qgsm ' ) is used , with ftf and the parametrized high - energy model ( ` he_gheisha ' ) as alternatives .",
    "further terms that appear in table  [ physicslistsoverview ] and are explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , are ` preco ' for the pre - compound model , ` qel ' for the quasi - elastic scattering model , and ` chips ' for the chiral invariant phase space model .",
    "the energy ranges of models tend to overlap . in the overlap region ,",
    "the model is chosen randomly but the choice is biased by the difference between the kinetic energy of the beam particle and the kinetic energy limits of the models .",
    ".overview of selected physics lists of hadronic interactions in geant4 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the unphysical peak in the distribution of secondary protons around @xmath13 is consistent with the kinematics of elastic scattering of the incoming particle with a proton at rest .",
    "the diffraction - like pattern in the distribution of seconday pions is consistent with diffractive scattering of the incoming particle on a stationary disc with the diameter of a nucleon .",
    "we conjecture that the differences between data and simulated geant4 data arise dominantly from an inadequate description of the elastic scattering and diffraction scattering of incoming beam particles on nucleons embedded in a nucleus .",
    "for the analysis of our data , we have used for incoming beam protons the qgsp_bic physics list and see no strong reason to reconsider this choice .",
    "for incoming beam pions , none of the standard physics lists for hadronic interactions was acceptable , so we had to build our private harp_cdp physics list .",
    "this physics list starts from the qbbc physics list ( see table  [ physicslistsoverview ] ) .",
    "yet the quark ",
    "gluon string model is replaced by the fritiof string fragmentation model for kinetic energy @xmath14  gev ; for @xmath15  gev , the bertini cascade is used for pions , and the binary cascade for protons ; elastic and quasi - elastic scattering is disabled .",
    "we qualify our harp_cdp physics list as ` acceptable ' in all four categories listed in table  [ tablewithconclusions ] .",
    "we have presented significant disagreements in the laboratory polar - angle distributions between data from the harp large - angle spectrometer , and data simulated by various physics lists in the geant4 simulation tool kit .",
    "an unphysical peak for secondary protons near @xmath16 , and an unphysical diffraction - like pattern for secondary pions appear as dominant problems .",
    "we are indebted to j.  apostolakis , g. folger , a. ribon and d.  wright for a useful discussion on geant4 intricacies .",
    "we are greatly indebted to many technical collaborators whose diligent and hard work made the harp detector a well - working instrument .",
    "we thank all harp colleagues who devoted time and effort to the design and construction of the detector , to data taking , and to setting up the computing and software infrastructure .",
    "we express our sincere gratitude to harp s funding agencies for their support ."
