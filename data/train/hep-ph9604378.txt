    "rare decays of bottom quark @xcite can be served as tests of the standard model ( sm ) . as the observed process @xmath7 which induced @xmath8 @xcite and @xmath9 @xcite at the hadronic level , @xmath10@xcite are also studied extensively in the past both at inclusive and at exclusive levels .",
    "it was recognized that the sm prediction for the branching ratio of @xmath11 , which is @xmath12@xcite , is within one order beyond the present detectivity and this process might be observed soon@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the corresponding exclusive decay @xmath13 is important as an input to determine @xmath14 to an accuracy of @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "pure leptonic decays of heavy pseudoscalar mesons into light lepton pairs are helicity suppressed , their branching ratios are @xcite : @xmath16 which make it difficult to determine @xmath17 from these processes . for @xmath6",
    "the situation is even worse due to the small ckm mixing angles .",
    "although the processes @xmath18 do not suffer from this suppression mechanism and the branching ratio is about @xmath19 @xcite in sm , it is hard to be detected at future @xmath20-factory where the efficiency is not better than @xmath21 .",
    "the processes @xmath0 , whose branching ratios depend quadrically on @xmath22 , can be taken as a possible alternate to determine the decay constants . for detections of these processes",
    "the method of searching for the `` missing mass '' can be used , which is similar to the case of @xmath11 @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we study the processes @xmath0 within the sm .",
    "we will analyze @xmath0 in the following : in section 2 the relevant effective hamiltonian will be given in sm .",
    "constituent quark model and pole model will be used in section 3 to give the predictions .",
    "finally , section 4 contains some brief discussion .",
    "let us start with the quark level process @xmath23 , with @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "the feynman diagrams are displayed in fig.1 .",
    "both box and z penguin diagrams contribute to this process .",
    "the resulting effective hamiltonian is left handed in sm @xcite : @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath28 is @xmath29 where @xmath30 . for simplicity",
    ", we neglect the qcd correction to this coefficient , whose effects are within @xmath31 if appropriate renormalization point is chosen @xcite .    since the neutrinos are massless in minimal sm , the processes @xmath32 as @xmath33 for convenience .",
    "] are forbidden by helicity .",
    "if an additional photon line is attached to any of the charged lines in fig.1 , the situation will be different : no helicity suppression exists any more .",
    "however , when the photon line is attached to one of the internal charged lines , there will be a suppression factor of @xmath34 in the wilson coefficient compared with the ones for @xmath35 .",
    "the reason is that these effective operators are now dimension-8 instead of dimension-6 . on the other hand , the diagrams in fig .",
    "1 with photon line connected to one of the external ( bottom or strange quark ) lines , whose effective hamiltonian turn out to be @xmath36 b ~(\\bar \\nu",
    "\\gamma ^\\mu p_l \\nu ) , \\label{h4}\\ ] ] will be the dominant contributions to the decay @xmath37 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian given in ( [ h4 ] ) is not enough to analyze the processes @xmath38 . in addition",
    ", models are needed to do the calculations at the hadronic level .",
    "first we use a simple constituent quark model ( see , for example @xcite ) . in this model both of the ( anti)quarks are treated non - relativistically with the same velocity of the hadron . thus ( anti)quarks masses are now constituent quark masses of the order of several hundred mev .",
    "we use further the interpolating field technique@xcite which relates all the hadronic matrix elements of the present case to the decay constants of the mesons .",
    "the amplitude for @xmath38 decay is : @xmath39 ( \\bar \\nu \\gamma",
    "^\\mu p_l \\nu).\\label{5}\\ ] ] the first term inside the bracket comes from the cp - odd part of @xmath40 , while the second term results from the cp - even part of @xmath40 . since @xmath41 ( @xmath42 )",
    ", we can safely neglect the term of @xmath43 . then after squaring the amplitude , both cp - odd and cp - even parts give the same contribution to the decay rate . performing the phase space integration over one of the two dalitz variables , and summing over the three generation of neutrinos",
    ", we get the differential decay width versus the @xmath44 invariant mass : @xmath45 the decay width is : @xmath46 using @xmath47 , @xmath48 gev , @xmath49 gev and @xmath50 , we get @xmath51 if the lifetime is taken as @xmath52 @xcite , the branching ratio is found to be @xmath53 . the differential decay rate versus @xmath54 is displayed in fig.2 ( solid line ) .    for @xmath6 meson decay , we take @xmath55 and @xmath56 gev .",
    "the decay width is then @xmath57 which corresponds to the branching ratio @xmath58 , if uses of @xmath59@xcite and @xmath60gev are made .",
    "we also apply the pole model to calculate the @xmath40 meson decay .",
    "the main contribution here is the radiative transition of the @xmath40 meson into an intermediate ( virtual ) @xmath61 .",
    "the feynman diagram is shown in fig.3 .",
    "the subsequent process @xmath62 is determined in sm by the effective hamiltonian eqn.([h4 ] ) , while the @xmath63 transition is taken as @xmath64 this corresponds to the first part of eqn.([5 ] ) , which is for the cp - odd part of @xmath40 .",
    "hereafter , we will concentrate only on the cp - odd combination of @xmath40 and @xmath65 .",
    "the effective coupling constant is usually explained as a function of the invariant mass of the intermediate @xmath61 .",
    "here we simply derive its value from the constituent quark model as a constant @xcite , @xmath66 the @xmath43 term can also be neglected compared to the @xmath67 term .",
    "note that the potential model@xcite gives @xmath68 with @xmath69 which is quite close to ( [ gcoup ] ) .",
    "now the amplitude of the decay @xmath38 is : @xmath70 here again we give the differential cross section for the purpose of being used experimentally : @xmath71 after integrating over the phase space , the decay width is obtained as @xmath72 where @xmath73 the formula ( [ 13],[14 ] ) are similar to the constituent quark model case eqn.([6],[7 ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see that if @xmath74 , @xmath75 are taken in eqn.([13],[14 ] ) , they will reduce exactly to eqn.([6],[7 ] ) .",
    "now we use @xmath76 gev and get : @xmath77 it is only slightly different from eqn.([9 ] ) , because @xmath78 is not quite different from @xmath79 .",
    "the branching ratio is @xmath80 , if @xmath81 gev is used .",
    "the differential decay rate calculated in pole model is also displayed in fig.2 ( dashed line ) as function of @xmath54 .    for @xmath6 meson",
    ", we get @xmath82 the branching ratio is obtained as @xmath83 , also quite close to that obtained in constituent quark model .",
    "we predict the branching ratios in sm for @xmath84 to be @xmath1 and for @xmath4 to be @xmath3 . with these branching ratios , they are hopeful to be detected at future b factories or lhc",
    ". they can provide alternate channels for measuring @xmath17 ( @xmath85 ) .",
