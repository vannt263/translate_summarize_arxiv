    "globular clusters ( gcs hereafter ) are an excellent way to study the formation , evolution , and dark matter ( dm ) content of galaxies of all types ( e.g. ashman & zepf 1998 ; harris 2001 ) .",
    "they are particularly well - suited for dynamical studies of early - type galaxies , since they are found in substantial numbers out to large radii around such galaxies and are bright enough to be seen at large distances .",
    "gcs complement other dynamical probes such as the stellar light , planetary nebulae ( pne ) , and x - ray data ( e.g. gerhard 2005 ; romanowsky 2005 ) .",
    "integrated stellar spectroscopy has the advantage of large sample sizes and high signal - to - noise , which allow the derivation of higher - order moments of the velocity distribution , but the faintness of the stellar halo restricts measurement to within a few effective radii of galaxy centers ( e.g. kronawitter et al .",
    "2000 ; gerhard et al . 2001 ) .",
    "x - ray data can probe further out , and recent high - quality data from rosat , asca , and _",
    "chandra _ have shown that extended dark halos are a common feature of all luminous ellipticals ( mathews & brighenti 2003 ; humphrey et al .",
    "2006 ) . however , accurate x - ray mass determinations require high - quality gas density and temperature profiles , along with the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium . as well",
    ", only massive ellipticals have hot diffuse gas halos for mass estimates .",
    "pne also have extended spatial distributions , and are easily identified because of their strong emission in the [ oiii ] 4959/5007 lines .",
    "romanowsky et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , using the planetary nebula spectrograph ( douglas et al .",
    "2002 ) , found that three intermediate - luminosity ellipticals ( ngcs 821 , 3379 , and 4494 ) have declining pne velocity dispersion profiles , consistent with simple models with little or no dm .",
    "this result is in conflict with the conventional model of galaxy formation , whereby galaxies form in dark matter halos .",
    "however , numerical simulations by dekel et al .",
    "( 2005 ) show that spiral - spiral mergers may lead to halo stars having highly radial orbits , as they are tidally ejected from the inner regions during the merger .",
    "observed pne in ellipticals , as part of this stellar halo , would then have line - of - sight velocity dispersions lower than that of the underlying dm .",
    "older tracers such as gcs are expected to have higher velocity dispersions , more representative of the dm . in support of this ,",
    "sambhus , gerhard & mendez ( 2006 ) have recently found that the bright and faint pne in ngc 4697 have different kinematics , and suggest that the bright pne are a younger population perhaps formed in tidal structures . our group ( pierce et al .",
    "2006a ) has found that the gc velocity dispersion profile in ngc 3379 increases with radius , and non - parametric , isotropic models yield a significant increase in the m / l ratio at large radii . a similar result for the ngc 3379 gcs has also been found by bergond et al.(2006 ) , from flames / vlt data . note also that peng , ford & freeman ( 2004a ) found a relatively low m / l ratio of 10@xmath315 for ngc 5128 from pne velocities .",
    "it is thus very important to compare gc and pne kinematics in a larger number of galaxies , to gain a more complete understanding of host galaxy dynamics .",
    "gc velocities have been used to study the dynamics of several early - type galaxies , including m87 ( cohen 2000 ; cote et al .",
    "2001 ) , ngc 4472",

    "it is consistently found that the gc velocity dispersions are either constant or increasing with radius .",
    "this is strong evidence for dm halos in these galaxies , supporting x - ray data .",
    "merger simulations ( hernquist & bolte 1993 ; vitvitska et al .",
    "2002 ; bekki et al . 2005 ) predict that ellipticals should have significant amounts of angular momentum at large radius .",
    "however , rotation is seen in some gc systems ( e.g. ngc 5128 ; m87 ) , but not in others ( e.g. ngc 1399 ; ngc 3379 ; ngc 4472 ) . in some cases",
    ", the lack of detected rotation may be due to small numbers of gcs ; but ngc 4472 and ngc 1399 have hundreds of gc velocities , allowing tight constraints on rotation except at the outer reaches of the datasets .",
    "the situation is even more complex when the kinematics of metal - poor ( mp ) and metal - rich ( mr ) gcs are studied separately . in most gc systems ,",
    "the mp and mr gcs are different in terms of their rotation and velocity dispersions , and these differences often depend on galactocentric radius .",
    "usually the mp gcs are dynamically hotter than the mr gcs , as might be expected given their generally shallower spatial profiles ( e.g. ngc 5128 , ngc 1399 , ngc 4472 ) . in some cases ( e.g. ngc 4472 , m87 ) the blue and red clusters may be counter - rotating at some radii . in only a few galaxies with the largest gc samples",
    "can we say anything about gc orbital anisotropy ; in ngc 1399 , ngc 4472 , and m87 the gcs are consistent with isotropic orbits ( though there are hints that the orbital behavior may be different for mp and mr sub - samples ) .",

    "2006 , in preparation ) , taken from the acs virgo cluster survey ( cote et al .",

    "we used the co - added gmos images provided by gemini staff for our object selection .",
    "here is a brief discussion of the procedure we have used to identify a clean sample of gc candidates for spectroscopy .",

    "we then used daophot to obtain photometry for point - like objects ( daofind , phot , and allstar ) .",

    "this calibration was first done on our field 2 , which has the most overlap with the hst data ; we then used overlapping regions between field 1 and field 2 to calibrate field 1 .",
    "we next matched the g ( v ) and i ( i ) images .",
    "the final result is photometry for @xmath7 800 point - like sources in field 1 , with v , i , and ( v@xmath3i ) colours good to @xmath9 0.1 mag ( sufficient for purposes of object selection ) .    from this input catalogue , we obtained a final sample of gc candidates by magnitude and colour selection .",
    "we selected a magnitude range from 19 @xmath1 v @xmath1 22.5 ; the bright cutoff corresponds to where we expect gcs to start appearing at the distance of ngc 4649 ( for a distance of 17.3 mpc , v=19 is @xmath7 3.3@xmath0 from the turnover in the gc luminosity function ) , while the faint cutoff is chosen to give at least a s / n of 5 in an 8 hour exposure .",
    "our colour range of 0.75 @xmath1 v@xmath3i @xmath1 1.4 was chosen to include all galactic gcs ( harris 1996 ) , with some allowance for more metal - poor ( bluer ) or more metal - rich ( redder ) gcs .",
    "this color range also encompasses the vast majority of gcs seen in other elliptical galaxies ( e.g. kundu & whitmore 2001 ; larsen et al .",
    "finally , obviously extended sources were eliminated by eye . after these cuts , 250 objects remained as ngc 4649 gc candidates .",
    "a gmos multi - slit mask was made for field 1 using the standard gemini gmmps software .",
    "in addition to our gc candidates , we included three stars with 15.5 @xmath1 v @xmath1 18.5 for mask alignment . using the b600 grism with a central wavelength of 5000  , a slit width of 1 , and a minimum slit length of 4",
    ", we were able to allocate 39 slits in field 1 and the three alignment stars .",
    "gmos spectroscopy was obtained for field 1 on 2003 may 31 , 2003 june 1 , 2003 june 4 , and 2003 june 27 , as part of program gn-2003a - q-22 .",
    "a total of 8 @xmath4 1800 sec exposure was obtained with a central wavelength of 5000  , and 8 @xmath4 1800 sec at 5050  ; we thus have a total of 8 hours on - source time .",
    "we used the b600_g5303 grism giving a dispersion of 0.45  / pixel and a resolution of @xmath7 5.5  .",
    "spectra typically cover a typical range from 3300@xmath35900  , but the wavelength range depends on the slit position on the mask and some spectra reach up to @xmath7 7000  .",
    "the seeing ranged from 0.65 to 0.9  over the 4 nights .",
    "bias frames , dome flatfields and copper - argon ( cuar ) arcs were also taken for calibration .",
    "typical wavelength residuals of 0.1    were achieved .",
    "data reduction was done in the following way , using the gemini / gmos iraf package ( version 1.6 ) :    * gsflat was used to make a normalized spectroscopic flatfield from individual flatfield exposures ( typically 3 or 4 ) * object frames were bias - subtracted and flatfielded using gsreduce * the arc frame was bias - subtracted , but not flatfielded , using gsreduce * gswavelength was used to establish the wavelength calibration from the cu - ar arc frames .",
    "this is a 2-d fit , and several iterations are required per aperture .",
    "this is the most tedious and interactive part of the reduction . *",
    "the object frames were then wavelength calibrated using gstransform * the object frames were then sky - subtracted interactively , using gsskysub * gemcombine was used to create a combined exposure from individual object frames , to act as a reference for extraction of the object spectra ( after checking to make sure there are no shifts between the object frames ) * gsextract was used to extract 1-d spectra from each object frame , using the reference frame created in the previous step ; optimal ( variance ) extraction was found to give the best results .",
    "* finally , scombine was used to combine spectra from the different object frames ; we did a median combine , used avsigclip for bad pixel rejection , and scaled each individual spectrum by the median of the counts between 4500@xmath35000  .",
    "the final spectra have s / n ranging from 5 - 21 per    at 5000  , with a median s / n of 11.5 per  .      to measure the gc velocities",
    ", we used the fxcor task in iraf .",
    "due to prohibitive time overheads , we did not observe radial velocity standard stars with gmos .",
    "therefore , we used six bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) model spectra for cross - correlation templates .",
    "these model spectra have metallicities [ fe / h ] of @xmath31.64 , @xmath30.33 , and + 0.1 , for ages of 5 and 14 gyr .",
    "we used the average of these 6 templates for our final velocity ( taking a weighted average only changes the velocities by @xmath7 1 km / sec ) ; all cross - correlation peak heights were higher than 0.1 and are therefore very secure .",
    "the velocity errors were taken to be the average of the errors returned by fxcor for the 6 templates , and thus only reflect the statistical uncertainties in these fits .",
    "the final velocities with their errors are given in the last two columns of table  [ cattable ] .",
    "there was only one background object ( a qso at z @xmath7 0.5 ) among the 39 spectra .",
    "our low contamination rate of 2.5% is attributable to the good seeing of our gmos images , and careful colour and magnitude selection .",
    "the remaining 38 objects have heliocentric velocities ranging from 484 to 1511 km / sec , and as we discuss in section  [ kinematics ] , we believe that these are all gcs belonging to ngc 4649 .",
    "table  [ cattable ] presents positions , photometry , and heliocentric velocities for our 38 confirmed ngc 4649 gcs .",
    "note that the photometry in table  [ cattable ] is gmos sloan g and g@xmath3i , taken from forbes et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ; errors in g and g@xmath3i are less than 0.05 mag .",
    "an approximate conversion to hst / wfpc2 v ( f555w ) and i ( f814w ) is given by : v = g @xmath3 0.75 @xmath9 0.1 , and v@xmath3i = g@xmath3i @xmath3 0.02 @xmath9 0.1 .",
    "figure  [ field - image ] shows the spatial distribution of the confirmed gcs .",
    "two objects deserves separate mention .",
    "object # 558 is marginally resolved on our gmos images , and clearly extended on hst / acs f475w and f850lp images ( proposal 9401 : note that the hst / acs images only became public in july 2004 , and we did not have access to them for our spectroscopic object selection ) .",
    "its velocity ( 1088 km / sec ) is consistent with both that of ngc 4649 ( 1117 km / sec ) or the virgo cluster ( 1079 km / sec ) .",
    "its apparent magnitude is v = 21.0 , giving it an absolute magnitude m@xmath2 = @xmath310.1 for a virgo distance of 16.8 mpc .",
    "it is our bluest object , with g - i = 0.74 .",
    "thus , its magnitude and colour are consistent with either a luminous gc or a faint ( stripped ? ) dwarf galaxy .",
    "stellar population model fits give an old age and low metallicity for # 558 , but the fits are uncertain ( pierce et al .",
    "for the moment , we retain this object in our kinematic sample .",
    "object # 1574 is in fact closer in both position and velocity to ngc 4647 than to ngc 4649 , and could plausibly be a gc associated with ngc 4647 .",
    "exclusion of # 1574 changes the mean velocity and velocity dispersions by less than 10 km / s , and makes no difference to the dynamical modelling in section [ mlratio ] ; thus , we retain this object also in our kinematic sample .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "figure  [ vel_dist ] shows both a conventional histogram and a generalized histogram of the velocities for the 38 ngc 4649 gc candidates .",
    "the generalized histogram uses an adaptive kernel technique to provide a non - parametric density estimate on a grid ; it is explained in detail in gebhardt et al .",
    "the 68% uncertainties result from monte carlo simulations .",
    "the systemic velocity of ngc 4649 is 1117 @xmath9 6 km / s ( trager et al . 2000 ) , the biweight mean velocity for all 38 gc candidates is 1066 @xmath9 45 km / s , and the median gc candidate velocity is 1094 km / s .    we first need to determine which of our 38 gc candidates are indeed bona - fide ngc 4649 gcs .",
    "we first note that the generalized histogram in figure  [ vel_dist ] shows a very smooth distribution , with no obvious groups of low or high velocity non - clusters .",
    "second , our lowest candidate velocity is 483 km / s , and it is very unlikely that a milky way field star would have this high a velocity .",
    "for instance , 99% of sdss stars have velocities less than 483 km / s .",
    "we have also ran besancon models ( robin et al . 2003 ) for the velocity distribution of halo stars towards ngc 4649 and none had a velocity as high as 483 km / sec .",
    "finally , none of the 41,000 + stars in the rave survey have a velocity as high as 483 km / s ( m. williams 2005 , private communication ) .",
    "another approach is to try kmm mixture modelling ( mclachlan & basford 1988 ; ashman , bird & zepf 1994 ) , to see if there is any evidence for more than one velocity group .",
    "we ran the kmm code for two groups , with the first group consisting of the 6 candidates with velocities 484 @xmath10 703 km / sec , trying both homoscedastic ( common covariance ) and heteroscedastic groups ( independent covariance ) .",
    "we also tried running kmm with the first group consisting solely of the lowest velocity candidate at 483 km / sec , but the result was identical to the first case . in no case did we find that two groups were a statistically better fit to the velocity distribution than one ( p - values of 0.25 and 0.52 for homoscedastic and heteroscedastic groups respectively ) .",
    "we conclude that all of the 38 gc candidates are indeed bona - fide gcs belonging to ngc 4649 ( but note that there is uncertainty about whether object # 1574 belongs to ngc 4649 or ngc 4647 , as discussed in section [ veldeterm ] ) .",
    "we have used the rostat code ( beers , flynn & gebhardt 1990 ) to calculate the biweight velocity dispersion for the ngc 4649 gcs .",
    "we have done this for all of the gcs , and for the blue and red gcs separately .",
    "the division between blue and red gcs is at ( g - i ) = 1.0 , based on the bimodality in the gc colour distribution seen in forbes et al .",
    "the velocity dispersion for all 38 gcs ( 256 @xmath9 29 km / sec ) is comparable to the dispersions found in other early - type galaxies . the velocity dispersion for the red gcs ( 288 @xmath9 43 km / s ) is higher than for the blue gcs ( 205 @xmath9 65 km / s ) , in contrast to other luminous ellipticals .",
    "to see how sensitive these results are to our colour boundary , we have set the boundary at ( g - i ) = 0.95 and ( g - i ) = 1.05 ; the blue / red dispersions are 181 @xmath9 50/297 @xmath9 39 , and 222 @xmath9 44/286 @xmath9 53 , for a boundary of ( g - i ) = 0.95/1.05 .",
    "the dispersions , especially for the blue gcs , are sensitive to the adopted colour boundary , but the difference in dispersion between the red and blue gcs persists for all 3 choices .",
    "the red gcs thus have a higher velocity dispersion than the blue gcs of 64@xmath3116 km / sec , but at a low significance level ranging from 0.9 to 1.8@xmath0 .",
    "figure  [ dis_profile ] shows the gc velocity dispersion radial profiles .",
    "this dispersion profile was derived using a lowess estimator , which runs a radial window function through the data to estimate the velocity squared ( see gebhardt & fischer 1995 , and pierce et al .",
    "2006a for further details ) .",
    "figure  [ dis_profile ] shows that the gc velocity dispersion profile is constant with radius within the errors .",
    "we have checked whether removal of the young and intermediate age clusters , as discussed in pierce et al .",
    "( 2006b ) , changes the dispersion values ; within the uncertainties there is no change in the results .",
    "we have searched for rotation in the gc system by doing non - linear least squares fits to the following equation :    @xmath11    where v@xmath12 is the gc rotation velocity ( amplitude ) , @xmath13 is the gc azimuthal angle , @xmath14 is the position angle of the line of nodes , and v@xmath15 is the systemic velocity of ngc 4649 .",
    "this determines the best - fitting flat rotation curve ; see zepf et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for more details .",
    "we have fit the above equation for all three gc samples ( total , blue , and red ) . because of the small numbers of gcs , we fixed v@xmath15 at the mean gc velocity ( 1066 km / sec ) .",
    "the gc mean velocity and systemic velocity of ngc 4649 differ by about 50 km / s .",
    "since we are measuring rotation and because our gc sample is not centered on the galaxy , by using the gc mean rotation , we may be removing rotation at the level of 50 km / s .",
    "thus , we will likely be underestimating the true rotation .",
    "we have also looked for rotation using the systemic velocity , but find small differences . in either case , rotation is not significant .",
    "figure  [ rot_all ] shows the gc velocities as a function of azimuthal angle , with the `` best - fit '' rotation curve for all gcs superimposed .",
    "it is clear that the data in figure [ rot_all ] show no rotation signature .",
    "this is confirmed by our quantitative fitting , which yields a rotation of 57 @xmath9 58 km / s for all gcs , and similar null results for blue and red gcs considered separately . in summary , there is no significant rotation in any of the gc samples .",
    "we have used monte carlo simulations to set an upper limit on the rotation velocity for all gcs .",
    "we generate artificial samples with the same position angle distributions and velocity dispersions as the data , but with a rotation curve of given amplitude imposed .",
    "the 95% confidence upper limit is defined as the rotation velocity for which only 5% of these simulations give a rotation velocity as small as that observed ( see zepf et al .",
    "we find a 95% upper limit of 150 km / s for the rotation amplitude of all gcs .",
    "combined with the velocity dispersion of 256 km / s ( section [ dispersion ] ) , we derive an upper limit for the ratio of rotation amplitude to velocity dispersion of v/@xmath0 @xmath1 0.6 .",
    "it is of course possible that rotation is present in the ngc 4649 gc system , but we have failed to detect it .",
    "the main factor is our poor spatial and azimuthal coverage ( see figure [ rot_all ] for our uneven azimuthal coverage ) . as well , while our total sample of 38 gcs is reasonable , the blue and red gc sample sizes are smaller than we would like .",
    "we plan to acquire more velocities in our other two fields , which will alleviate the above difficulties and allow us to set tighter constraints on the presence or absence of rotation .",
    "we use two approaches to measure the m / l profile in ngc 4649 . as a first step ,",
    "we use spherical , isotropic models applied to the stellar kinematics and the gc kinematics . with only 38 gc velocities , it is hard to go much beyond the isotropic assumption without additional constraints .",
    "while we fully understand the limitations with these assumptions , we argue that for comparative value , isotropic models are informative since many previous studies have relied on these .",
    "our second approach uses fully - general axisymmetric models .",
    "these models are based on schwarzchild ( 1979 ) , where one runs a set of orbits in a specified potential and fits for the orbital weights to best match the observational contraints .",
    "however , since these models are so general ( i.e. , allowing anisotropy as a free parameter spatially in both radius and angle ) , 38 velocities will be inadequate to overcome the uncertainties in both the potential and orbital structure .",
    "fortunately , ngc 4649 has a detailed mass model from _ chandra _ x - ray observations ( humphrey et al .",
    "thus , we use the m / l profile as determined from x - rays as the input into the orbit - based models , which then provide the best - fit orbital structure .",
    "both techniques give the same answer , that ngc 4649 requires a substantial increase in the m / l at large radii .",
    "the isotropic models are straightforward and follow the approach outlined in pierce et al .",
    "( 2006a ) .",
    "briefly , we use non - parametric models assuming isotropy ( see gebhardt & fischer 1995 ) .",
    "we use both the gc velocities and stellar kinematic data for the inner 70from pinkney et al .",
    "for the surface brightness profile , we use the stellar light profiles of lauer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and caon et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , where the latter extends out to over 700 .",
    "the lauer et al .",
    "profile is in the @xmath16-band , and we transform the caon et al .",
    "@xmath17-band profile by matching in the overlap region .",
    "we find @xmath18 .",
    "we apply an extinction correction of @xmath19 ( schegel et al .",
    "however , since we are fitting the gcs , we should in fact be using their number density profile .",
    "forbes et al .",
    "( 2004 ) compare the gc profile to the stellar profile .",
    "they find that the red gcs are very similar to the stellar profile , whereas the blue gcs are slightly flatter .",
    "given the uncertainties in these profiles , and that there are more velocities from the red gcs , use of the stellar light profile is reasonable .",
    "figure [ mlprof ] shows the results .",
    "the upper panel shows the combined stellar and gc velocity dispersion ( solid ( red ) line ) , with 1@xmath0 errors ( red hatched region ) .",
    "the dashed ( black ) curve in the upper panel is the expected isotropic velocity dispersion profile for a constant m / l ratio ( ie .",
    "no dark matter ) .",
    "the gc data are inconsistent with the constant m / l ratio model over most of the radial range .",
    "the lower panel shows the projected ( m / l)@xmath2 ratio for the stellar and gc data with 1 @xmath0 errors ( solid ( red ) line and hatched region ) , and the dashed ( blue ) line is the _ chandra _ x - ray ( m / l)@xmath2 profile from humphrey et al .",
    "the x - ray analysis of humphrey et al . provides the total mass , and we convert to m / l by dividing by our v - band light profile .",
    "the gc data show an increasing m / l ratio with radius , in other words implying a dm halo in ngc 4649 .",
    "there is excellent agreement between the gc and x - ray mass profiles , reinforcing the evidence for this dm halo .",
    "all aspects of the axisymmetric orbit - based models are provided in four papers : gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2003 ) and thomas et al .",
    "( 2004 , 2005 ) .",
    "thomas et al .",
    "( 2005 ) provides the most direct comparison since it studies dark halo properties .",
    "briefly , we first input a potential , either from stellar light only or a known mass profile ( i.e. , the x - ray potential ) .",
    "we then run a set of orbits in that potential that covers the available phase space .",
    "thomas et al .",
    "( 2004 ) provide a detailed description of the orbit sampling . for ngc 4649",
    ", we use approximately @xmath20 orbits and 255 observational constraints .",
    "we then determine the non - negative orbital weights that best match the observational constraints .",
    "we use entropy as a way to facilitate the @xmath21 minimization over this large set of parameters .",
    "the use of entropy as a way to regularize the models has very little effect on the results ( as we discuss below ) .    for the potential , we use both the stellar light profile and the x - ray profile .",
    "the stellar light profile is the same as used above for the isotropic models , except we now include the proper axis ratio of 0.88 .",
    "we assume that the galaxy is edge - on .",
    "we run two sets of orbits : one for a constant stellar m / l ( taking m / l@xmath2 = 8 ; see figure [ mlprof ] ) , and one with a profile that uses a constant stellar m / l ( again m / l@xmath2 = 8) out to 45and following the x - ray m / l profile beyond that . at the outer limit of the model ,",
    "the increase in the m / l is a factor of 2.5 from the central regions ( inside 45 ) . for completeness",
    ", we include a central black hole as reported in gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ; this will likely effect the kinematics near the center only , but since we desire the orbital structure throughout the galaxy , it is important to include as realistic a potential as possible .",
    "the model is the same as in gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , where we divide the model in spatial bins consisting of 20 radial and 5 angular bins .",
    "the orbit sampling as outlined in thomas et al .",
    "( 2005 ) allows for very efficient coverage of the available phase - space of the distribution function .",
    "the kinematics come from published results in pinkney et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and the gc velocities presented here .",
    "pinkney et al .",
    "have fairly extensive stellar kinematics along 3 position angles and go out to 70  along the major axis .",
    "for the gcs , we only use those beyond the stellar data , and we only use them in three radial bins .",
    "we measure the velocity dispersions from the gcs using a maximum - likelihood approach that includes the uncertainties directly ( as discussed in pryor & meylan 1993 ) .",
    "the three dispersion values give approximately the same results as the lowess estimator .",
    "the three radial bins are at @xmath22  with dispersion values of 230 @xmath9 60 , 270 @xmath9 75 , 220 @xmath9 70 km / s , respectively . since the gcs are spread over the full angular range of the galaxy , we sum up the model angular bins in the same way ( as opposed to the stellar kinematics , which are along particular position angles ) .",
    "there are two main ways in which to use the orbit - based models .",
    "first , one can use the fit in a @xmath21 sense to determine which potential gives the best fit to the data . in this way",
    ", one would run orbits in a large set of potentials and then choose which one has the lowest @xmath21 as the best model . the second result from the orbit models",
    "is that for a given potential , the model produces a distribution function that optimizes the fit to the observations .",
    "thomas et al . ( 2004 , 2005 ) , as well as cappellari et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , have done many tests determining the ability to recover the distribution function using analytic models .",
    "if one has adequate radial and angular coverage , then the distribution function can be recovered robustly . in the case of ngc 4649 , we are unlikely to get detailed information on the distribution function , but should be able to obtain reliable projections of it .",
    "for example , as shown in gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and gebhardt ( 2004 ) , the simple ratio of the radial to tangential dispersions as a function of radius and angle is a useful and robust quantity .",
    "thus , for ngc 4649 we concentrate on this ratio .",
    "the program obviously provides both angular dispersions : the azimuthal ( parallel to the equatorial plane ) and the polar ( perpendicular to the equatorial plane ) .",
    "we add in quadrature the two angular dispersions and average , and compare this quantity to the radial dispersion .",
    "thus , isotropic models have radial and tangential dispersions equal to each other .",
    "figure  [ mlorbit ] shows the internal dispersion ratio for the potentials using the m / l profile from x - rays ( upper panel ) and a constant m / l ( lower panel ) , along each position angle . for the x - ray profile ,",
    "the orbital structure becomes slightly tangentially biased beyond 100 ; the average ratio is about 0.8 . for the constant m / l model ,",
    "the average ratio is about 0.7 .",
    "the stronger tangential bias in the constant m / l model is what one would expect if a dark halo is present but not included in the dynamical models .",
    "one way to increase the projected dispersions at large radii is to put more energy into the tangential component .    due to the large uncertainties in the kinematics from the gcs , we have not explored other dark halo models beyond the x - ray potential .",
    "however , we note that the overall fit to the data is better with the x - ray potential than with the constant m / l model .",
    "the change in @xmath21 is 5 , implying a signficance of greater than 95% .",
    "thus , with these data and the x - ray potential alone , we find a strong significance for a dark halo",
    ". a further test would be to try a variety of dark halo models .",
    "since we only tried one , it is very likely that the minimum @xmath21 will be even lower , implying a yet higher significance .",
    "thus , we have not determined the best fit dark halo model for this dataset ; this implies that we have not found the best fit orbital structure as well .",
    "presumably , if the dark halo were more massive than the x - ray model suggests , we would find an orbital structure that is more consistent with isotropy .",
    "however , this test does demonstrate the power of combining x - ray data and kinematics .",
    "if we take the x - ray potential as truth , then the underlying orbital distribution is as given in figure  [ mlorbit ] ; i.e. , the gcs are nearly isotropic out to 100 , and tangentially biased beyond that radius .",
    "we have not detected any rotation in the ngc 4649 gc system , with v/@xmath0 @xmath1 0.6 for all gcs .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , there is considerable variation in the rotation properties of gc systems amongst early - type galaxies .",
    "projection effects certainly play some role in explaining this variation , but these effects have not been properly studied to date . a range of rotation properties is also seen from pne data , with several ellipticals showing little rotation ( v/@xmath0 @xmath7 0.2 ; romanowsky 2004 ) . yet",
    "most simulations of elliptical galaxy formation predict significant amounts of angular momentum in their outer halos ( e.g. barnes 1992 ; vivitska et al .",
    "one possibility is that angular momentum is transported beyond the radial range of our data , which is @xmath7 20 kpc or 3.2@xmath36.5 r@xmath23 .",
    "simulations also show that the angular momentum of dm halos is generally larger for major mergers , and lower for multiple accretion of satellites ( gerhard 2005 ) .",
    "thus , the merging history of ellipticals may also play a role in determining their rotation .",
    "it is interesting to note in this context that there is no evidence for a a major merger ( or indeed any recent interaction ) in ngc 4649 .",
    "pierce et al .",
    "( 2006b ) have found several young ( 2 - 3 gyr ) gcs in ngc 4649 .",
    "the origin of these young gcs is not clear , but the fact that gcs younger and older than 9 gyr have very similar velocity dispersions ( see section [ dispersion ] ) argues against the young gcs having been formed in a merger .",
    "we have also been able to put constraints on the orbital structure of the gcs , through the use of orbit - based models with a specified potential .",
    "we find that the gc orbits are close to isotropic out to 100 , but become tangentially biased at larger radii ( figure [ mlorbit ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , there are very few early - type galaxies with which we can compare our results .",
    "an analysis similar to ours for ngc 4649 has been carried out for m87 ( cote et al . 2001 ) and m49 ( cote et al .",
    "2003 ) . in both galaxies ,",
    "the entire gc system is close to isotropic at all radii .",
    "there are differences , however , when the metal - poor and metal - rich gcs are considered separately . in m87 ,",
    "the metal - poor gcs are tangentially biased at all radii , particularly within 15 kpc , while the metal - rich gcs are isotropic or slightly tangentially biased within 15 kpc , and radially biased beyond this radius . in m49 , the metal - poor gcs are close to isotropic , while the metal - rich gcs become tangentially biased at large radius .",
    "richtler et al . (",
    "2004 ) were able to place weak constraints on the orbital structure of the ngc 1399 gcs , finding that the metal - rich gcs are close to isotropic , and that the metal - poor gcs have a slight tangential bias .",
    "overall then , existing data show that gcs in early - type galaxies generally have orbits that are close to isotropic , but there may be differences in the orbital structure of metal - poor and metal - rich gc subsystems . unfortunately , our small sample size does not allow us to investigate such possible differences in the metal - poor and metal - rich gcs in ngc 4649 .",
    "the models presented in this paper use axiysmmetric orbit - based models , which are the most general models one can run assuming axisymmetry , and thus should provide the most fair description of the orbital structure .",
    "the previous models listed above are all based on spherical symmetry , and it may be that once more realistic models are used , a clear picture of the outer structure may emerge .    we have found evidence for a dm halo in ngc 4649 from both spherical , isotropic models and axisymmetric , orbit - based models .",
    "the isotropic models give a m / l@xmath2 of 9@xmath328 at 260  radius ( @xmath7 21 kpc ; figure [ mlprof ] ) .",
    "the isotropic gc m / l profile ( figure [ mlprof ] ) gives excellent agreement with the _ chandra _ m / l profile ( humphrey et al .",
    "de bruyne et al .",
    "( 2001 ) also found evidence for a dm halo from their stellar kinematic data extending to @xmath7 90 .",
    "figure [ mlprof ] shows that the ngc 4649 m / l ratio is @xmath7 8 near the galaxy center , and starts increasing at @xmath7 50 .",
    "there is a significant difference between the effective radius r@xmath24 for ngc 4649 in the optical and ir , with optical values between 70@xmath380  ( rc3 ; faber et al .",
    "1989 ; van der marel 1991 ) , and a 2mass k - band value of 42  ( jarrett et al . 2003 ) . in any case",
    ", both x - ray and gc data suggest that ngc 4649 is becoming dm - dominated beyond @xmath7 1 r@xmath23 , as has been found for other ellipticals ( gerhard 2005 ; romanowsky 2005 ; mamon & lokas 2005 ) .",
    "dm halos are commonly found in other early - type galaxies from gc , x - ray , and stellar kinematic data ( see introduction ; gerhard 2005 ; napolitano et al .",
    "however , pne data have been used to argue against the existence of dm halos in early - type galaxies ( e.g. romanowsky et al .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , this may be because pne in early - type galaxies are on preferentially radial orbits . for cluster galaxies there is the added complication of potential contamination from intra - cluster pne ( e.g. feldmeier et al .",
    "unfortunately , there are no published pne data for ngc 4649 to compare our gc results with .",
    "gc spectroscopy allows both the determination of velocities and ages / abundances , allowing us to investigate whether kinematics depends on age .",
    "however , even with 8m - class telescopes , it is difficult to obtain the high s / n spectra needed for reliable age determinations , so there is little age data available at present .",
    "we have found that exclusion of four young ( 2@xmath33 gyr : # 89 , 175 , 502 , 1443 ) and two intermediate - age ( 5@xmath36 gyr : # 517 , 1182 ) gcs in ngc 4649 ( see pierce et al .",
    "2006b ) has no significant effect on the m / l profile , but our gc sample size is not large . more kinematic data for a range of tracers , including pne , gc , stellar , and x - ray , are needed for ngc 4649 and other early - type galaxies .",
    "we have used gemini / gmos to obtain spectra for 38 confirmed globular clusters in ngc 4649 .",
    "the recession velocities of these clusters have been used to study the cluster kinematics and dark matter content of ngc 4649 .",

    "we detect no rotation in the gc system , both for all clusters , and for blue and red samples separately .",
    "we are able to place upper limits on the ratio of rotation velocity to velocity dispersion v/@xmath0 @xmath1 0.6 for all gcs . further data to improve our spatial and azimuthal coverage , and our sample size , are needed to make further progress . * both spherical , isotropic and axisymmetric , orbit - based dynamical models strongly support the presence of a dark matter halo in ngc 4649 . for the isotropic models",
