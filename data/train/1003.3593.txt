    "when one considers irreversible finsler metrics , the problem of counting closed geodesics becomes more delicate because of a. katok s famous example of 1973 which shows that there exist some irreversible finsler metrics on @xmath7 with only finitely many closed geodesics ( cf .",

    "this result is used to prove that on every ( irreversible or reversible ) finsler sphere @xmath7 , it is impossible that there exists only one prime closed geodesic which is rational .    in the section 3 of this paper ,",
    "we study first the growth properties of indices of iterates of irrational closed geodesics .",

    "for the claim 1 of theorem 4.4 with a reversible finsler metric on @xmath3 , by the same reason , the above proof of theorem 4.4 works without any change and shows that the only geometrically distinct prime closed geodesic @xmath25 which can not be rational in the reversible case .    for theorem 4.4 with a reversible finsler metric on @xmath3 and only one geometrically distinct prime closed geodesic @xmath25 on @xmath3 which is completely non",
