    "as the atmospheres of more exoplanets are being characterized , astronomers are finding that a non - negligible fraction of them are cloudy ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "cloudy atmospheres are challenging to decipher , because the interpretation of their chemical abundances is degenerate with the degree of cloudiness ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it motivates the construction of dimensionless indices for quantifying the degree of cloudiness of the atmosphere of a transiting exoplanet .",
    "if trends between these indices and the properties of the exoplanet or its star are found , then one may select a sub - sample of cloudfree objects for more indepth atmospheric characterization using future facilities such as the james webb space telescope .",
    "essentially , any trends found allow us to perform triage on the cloudy objects .",
    "@xcite has previously defined a cloudiness index based on near - infrared diagnostics : the strength of the water feature at about 1.4 @xmath2 m , as probed by wfc3 on the hubble space telescope , and the j band .",
    "the study of @xcite found that exoplanets with equilibrium temperatures higher than 700 k and surface gravities greater than @xmath3 ( cgs units ) are more likely to be cloudfree .",
    "@xcite found a correlation between the strength of the 1.4 @xmath2 m water feature and the difference in transit radii between the near- and mid - infrared wavelengths .",
    "the approach of @xcite is based on using one - dimensional , self - consistent model atmospheres in chemical and radiative equilibrium , along with an assumed value for the metallicity , as a baseline for defining what  cloudfree \" means .    in the current letter",
    ", we take a different and complementary approach by constructing a cloudiness index based on the notion that , in a cloudfree atmosphere , the difference in transit radii between the line center and wing of the sodium or potassium lines should be straightforwardly calculable .",
    "a cloudy atmosphere would have a value of this difference in transit radii that is _ less _ than the cloudfree value @xcite , thereby naturally allowing us to define a cloudiness index .",
    "we apply our cloudiness index to the sample of exoplanets presented in @xcite and report a tentative trend between cloudiness at visible wavelengths and the strength of stellar irradiation .",
    "before constructing our cloudiness index , we examine in detail if measurements of the spectral slope in the visible range of wavelengths may be used , in isolation , to quantify the degree of cloudiness of an atmosphere .",
    "@xcite have previously published , in their appendix , approximate algebraic solutions to infer the mean molecular mass of an atmosphere based on a pair of transit measurements at different wavelengths .",
    "we wish to point out that these formulae have an earlier origin and also elucidate the assumptions behind them .    in work preceding @xcite , @xcite have shown that , in an isothermal atmosphere , the temperature may be inferred from @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the mean molecular mass , @xmath6 is the surface gravity , @xmath7 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath8 is the transit radius and @xmath9 is the cross section for absorption or scattering .",

    "it immediately follows that @xmath14 independent of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "physically , it implies that measuring the spectral slope alone does not allow us to distinguish between scattering by molecules or aerosols , since the preceding expression has no dependence on either @xmath15 or @xmath16 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : isotemp ] ) becomes @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 correspond to the transit radii at the wavelengths @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",

    "it is important to note that only @xmath23 is an observable , which allows @xmath24 to be inferred .",
    "it does not allow one to ascertain if rayleigh scattering is at work , i.e. , that @xmath22 .",
    "this is an assumption .",
    "if we are associating the rayleigh slope with aerosols / condensates , then we are assuming that the particles have a radius of @xmath25 .    by further manipulating equation ( [ eq : scaleheight ] ) , we obtain equation ( a7 ) of @xcite",
    ", @xmath26 the preceding expression carries an additional assumption : the stellar radius ( @xmath27 ) is assumed to be the same at both wavelengths .    in summary , @xcite and @xcite",
    "are using the same algebraic formula to essentially infer the isothermal pressure scale height by assuming that rayleigh scattering is at work ( @xmath22 ) .",

    "we first wish to establish that , when the line is undetected , it is most probably not due to it being dominated by rayleigh scattering associated with hydrogen molecules .",
    "rather , the absence of a sodium or potassium line is either due to a vanishingly low abundance of sodium or potassium or a very cloudy atmosphere . since there is no way to distinguish between these scenarios without additional information , we will focus on applying our cloudiness index only to objects with reported sodium / potassium line detections .    for the sodium or potassium line center to be unaffected by rayleigh scattering associated with hydrogen molecules , the relative abundance of sodium or potassium ( to h@xmath29 ) , by number , has to greatly exceed a threshold value , @xmath30 the cross section for rayleigh scattering by molecules is @xcite , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a reference number density",

    "it is conceivable that the visible and near - infrared wavelengths are probing different atmospheric layers and one layer being cloudfree does not preclude the other being cloudy .",
