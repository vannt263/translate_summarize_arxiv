    "over the last dozen years a wide and variegated mass of observations revealed that the universe is now expanding at an accelerated rate@xcite . it is usually assumed that this accelerated expansion is caused by the so called dark energy ( de ) , a cosmic fluid characterized by a negative pressure , @xmath2 , and a negative equation of state @xmath3 . according to the last estimates , more than @xmath4 of matter - energy in the universe is in the form of dark energy , so that the universe is today in the dark energy dominant era .",
    "unfortunately the nature of dark energy is not known .",
    "a huge amount of models of dark energy ( de ) have been so far proposed .",
    "the first candidate for de has been the cosmological constant , @xmath5 , with a constant equation of state ( eos ) parameter , @xmath6 .",
    "this model , although it generally fit quite well a large part of the current astronomical observations , shows some difficulties , foremost of theoretical nature : for example , it turns out that it is difficult to reconcile the small present day value of de density with the value predicted by the quantum field theories @xcite@xcite . from the observational point of view , the present data seem to favor an evolving de , with the eos parameter allowed to cross the value @xmath6 ( _ phantom crossing _ ) .",
    "moreover , a large part of the dark energy models so far proposed is based on the einstein general relativity ( gr ) theory of gravity , and it is therefore conceivable that the observed accelerating expansion could be interpreted as effects of alterations of the gravity action introduced in modified theories .",
    "actually , in the last years different extensions to gravity have been widely investigated : by choosing the gravitational action as function of the ricci scalar , @xmath7@xcite@xcite , or considering the framework of @xmath8 gravity in which @xmath9 is a generic function of the ricci curvature scalar r and the gauss - bonnet topological invariant @xmath10 @xcite , or other curvature invariants@xcite . in a quite different approach , avoiding the curvature defined via the levi - civita connection , it is possible to introduce and use an alternative connection that has no curvature ( vanishing @xmath11 ) but torsion @xmath12 ( _ teleparallelism gravity _ ) .",
    "this has the property that the torsion is formed completely from products of first derivatives of the tetrad , with no second derivatives appearing in the torsion tensor .",
    "thus , one can extend the lagrangian density by adding a torsion function , i.e. @xmath13 . our work , as the most part of research in f(t ) gravity , is naturally focused on the application to cosmology , comparing the theoretical predictions to the observational data.it turns out that within these @xmath0 models , it is possible to obtain an inflationary evolution without an inflation and the _ dark torsion _ provides the accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite@xcite .",
    "however , it worth noting that recently also astrophysical applications started to be discussed in literature ( see for instance @xcite @xcite and @xcite ) . just as in the case of @xmath7-gravity theories , it turns out that several models of the @xmath0-gravity agree with different data @xcite , so that these alternative approaches can not be discriminated so far from the _ observational _ point of view . moreover , a key topic in both the @xmath7 , and the @xmath0 scenarios is the choice of these functions . to overcome this degeneration , it is possible to adopt a quite different approach , the cosmography , relying on the time - series expansion of the scale factor .",
    "the cosmographic approach allows us to fit the data ( for instance on the distance - redshift relation ) , without any a priori assumption on the underlying cosmological model .",
    "it is just based on the assumption that the universe can be described by the friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker metric .",
    "the snia hubble diagram extends up to @xmath14 thus invoking the need for , at least , a fifth order taylor expansion of the scale factor in order to give a reliable approximation of the distance - redshift relation . as a consequence ,",
    "it could be , in principle , possible to estimate up to five cosmographic parameters , @xmath15 , although the still too small data sets available does not allow to get a precise and realistic determination of all of them . once these quantities have been determined , it is actually possible to relate the cosmographic parameters and the present day value of @xmath16 , with @xmath17 .",
    "these relations will allow to achieve reliable cosmological constraints on the @xmath0 derivatives , and to test some @xmath0 gravity models . for constraining the cosmographic parameters , we use the union2 type ia supernovae ( snia ) data set , the hubble diagram constructed from some gamma ray bursts luminosity distance indicators , and gaussian priors on the distance from the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) , and the hubble constant @xmath1 ( such priors have been included in order to help break the degeneracies among model parameters ) . in section",
    "ii we will review the @xmath0- gravity . in section iii we will introduce the basic notions of the cosmographic parameters .",
    "section iv contains the main result of the paper demonstrating how the @xmath0 derivatives can be related to the cosmographic parameters.we summarize and conclude in section v.",
    "for the tangent space we consider an orthonormal basis @xmath18 ( vierbein ) at each point @xmath19 on a 4 dimensional manifold , where @xmath20 , in order to obtain the cosmological equations .",
    "thus , the metric is obtained from the dual basis @xmath21 : @xmath22 being @xmath23 the coordinates of the dual basis with respect to a coordinate basis on the cotangent space .",
    "teleparallelism gravity uses the so called weitzenbck connection , to introduce a non - null torsion @xmath24 given by : @xmath25 the associated lagrangian is @xmath26 being @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the contorsion tensor @xmath29      our starting point is the teleparallelism action @xmath30 the fields equations can are derived by variating the action with respect to the vierbein leads : @xcite @xmath31 where a prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath12 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the energy - momentum tensor .     under the assumption of a flat frw universe",

    "the cosmographic approach to cosmology recently aroused great interest as it allows to obtain information from observations ( mainly measured distances ) just assuming the minimal priors of isotropy and homogeneity , without assuming which kind of dark energy and dark matter are needed to satisfy the einstein equation .",

    ", it is possible to express the luminosity distance @xmath54 as a power series in the redshift parameter @xmath55 whose coefficients are functions of the scale factor @xmath35 and its higher order derivatives .",
    "this expansion leads to a distance - redshift relation that is fully model independent since it does not depend on the particular form of the solution of cosmic evolution equations . to this purpose , it is convenient to introduce the * cosmographic functions * @xcite : @xmath56 the cosmographic parameters , which are usually indicated as the _ hubble _ , _ deceleration _ , _ jerk _ , _ snap _ and _ lerk _ parameters , respectively , correspond to the functions evaluated at the present time @xmath57 . furthermore , it is possible to relate the derivative of the hubble parameter to the cosmographic parameters : @xmath58 where a dot denotes derivative with respect to the cosmic time @xmath59 .",
    "it turns out that equivalent expressions can be obtained starting from the taylor series expansion of the hubble parameter @xmath60 and using the derivation rule @xmath61      in order to relate the present day values of @xmath0 and its derivatives to the cosmographic parameters @xmath62 the first step consists in to differentiating eq .",

    "what remains to be proved is whether the dark energy is constant , or varies in redshift and perhaps space coordinates , or whether describing the universe by bare general relativity fails on large scale , and some extended theory of gravity is needed .",
    "whatever future observations will discover , the basic plot of the distance scale will be a primary icon of the modern cosmology . the data for this plot come primarily from measurements of sneia and baryon acoustic oscillations , which show a deep complementarity : actually sneia measurements have negligible cosmic variance limit ; that is , under a practical approach , in theory we can build up arbitrarily large samples .",

    "we are interested in the teleparallel gravity theory , and are focused on its application to cosmology , i.e. in evaluating the present day values of the function @xmath0 and its derivatives without solving the dynamical equations .",
    "our analysis is based on the union2.1 type ia supernovae ( snia ) data set , the hubble diagram constructed from gamma ray bursts luminosity distance indicators , some measurements of the function @xmath149 derived from the age of passively evolving galaxies and from the bao , and some gaussian priors on the distance from the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) , and finally the hubble constant h. we explore the 5-d space of parameters using the markov chain monte carlo technique , and following a bayesian approach : we indeed use the median values as maximum likelihood value , in order to give more importance to the sampling of the distribution function of the marginalized parameters , rather than use the best fit accordance criterium . in order to relate the constraints on the cosmographic parameters to the derivatives of @xmath172 we use the map defined through the eqs .",
    "( [ f0t][f4 t ] ) , which we evaluate along the final thinned _ cosmographic chain_. to this aim we adopt a conservative approach , by considering that only the deceleration parameter , @xmath168 , and the jerk , @xmath169 , are well constrained , so that we limit our constraints on @xmath219 , since @xmath220 depends on @xmath170 and @xmath171 also . deriving from a model independent method , these constraints have to be satisfied by any @xmath0 theory .",
    "therefore , we can investigate a priori , and without solving the field equation , a specific model by comparing the theoretically with the observed values of the derivatives of @xmath172 .",
    "as an example , we have considered some most common models it turns out that the estimations of @xmath182 and @xmath183 parameters for the model proposed by bengochea et al . and",
    "are in agreement with the cosmographic constrains , showing a good overlap .",
    "instead the estimations of the parameter for the first model proposed by myrzakulov are weakly inconstintent with the cosmographic parameters , while the second model is not favoured by observations .",
    "finally , in the case of the last model , it turns out that @xmath182 is in agreement with cosmographic constraints and @xmath183 shows a marginal overlap .",
    "it is worth noticing how the renewed interest in cosmography has now opened the way to an alternative way to explore dark energy scenarios in different gravity theories , such as @xmath0 .",
