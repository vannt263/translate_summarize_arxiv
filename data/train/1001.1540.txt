    "any probability measure @xmath3 on the real line , all of whose moments are finite , has associated to it two sequences of jacobi parameters @xmath4 : for example , @xmath3 is the spectral measure of the tridiagonal matrix @xmath5 we will denote this fact by @xmath6 with @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "these parameters are related to the moments of the measure via the viennot - flajolet @xcite and accardi - boejko @xcite formulas . on the other hand , in probability theory and other applications ,",
    "measures frequently come in time - dependent convolution semigroups . in general ,",
    "the time dependence of the jacobi parameters is complicated ( they are rational functions of @xmath1 ) .",
    "however , for the gaussian convolution semigroup @xmath9 the jacobi parameters are simply @xmath10 while for the poisson convolution semigroup @xmath11 they are @xmath12 so it is natural to ask , what are all the measures whose jacobi parameters are linear ( in the calculus sense , that is , affine ) functions of the convolution parameter ? a seemingly more general question is to describe all collections @xmath13 such that the spectral measures @xmath14 of tridiagonal matrices @xmath15 form a convolution semigroup . in this paper",
    "we provide the answer : such measures form precisely the meixner class @xcite .",
    "thus we add a new , more dynamical description to already numerous known characterizations of this class .",
    "in particular , far from being infinite dimensional , this family of measures is described by only four parameters . for more on the meixner class ,",
    "see the probabilistic characterizations in @xcite , its role in statistics ( where it is known under the name of quadratic exponential families ) @xcite , and a more combinatorial description @xcite .",
    "the reason convolution semigroups appear in probability theory is that if @xmath16 is a process with stationary independent increments , and @xmath17 is the distribution of @xmath18 , then @xmath14 form a convolution semigroup . in non - commutative probability theories , one encounters other notions of independence , and correspondingly other convolution operations based on them . in many ways ,",
    "these operations are more complicated than the usual convolution ; notably , the usual operation is distributive , @xmath19 while the other ones are not .",
    "nevertheless , in other ways they appear to be simpler .",
    "the combinatorial theory of such convolutions is typically based on an appropriate sequence of cumulants which linearize it ; for example , the classical cumulants @xmath20 defined via @xmath21 have the property that @xmath22 in particular , @xmath23 : cumulants are always proportional to the convolution parameter @xmath1 .",
    "while , as pointed out above , there is a nice relation between jacobi parameters and moments , as well as a relation between cumulants and moments ( see section  [ subsec : cumulants ] ) , we are not aware of a simple relation between jacobi parameters and cumulants .",
    "however , in @xcite , the second author found a formula relating jacobi parameters and _ free _ cumulants , which linearize the _ free convolution _ @xcite .",
    "this allows us to provide a constructive proof that jacobi parameters are linear in the free convolution parameter if and only if the measure belongs to the free meixner class considered in @xcite and numerous other sources .",
    "we then give a simple but indirect argument which provides the corresponding characterization for the meixner class .",
    "another consequence of the analysis is that there are no measures whose jacobi parameters are polynomial functions of the free convolution parameter of degree greater than one , so the spectral measures of matrices from equation   are no more general .    yet another convolution operation was introduced in @xcite in relation to what the authors called `` conditionally free probability '' , but is better called two - state free probability theory . as the name indicates ,",
    "this is a convolution operation @xmath24 on pairs of measures , and as such does not really have a classical analogue .",
    "the techniques from @xcite allow us to find all pairs of measures @xmath25 such that if @xmath26 then the jacobi parameters of @xmath27 are linear with respect to this convolution .",
    "in fact , it suffices to only require that the jacobi parameters of @xmath27 are polynomials in @xmath1 , and the linearity of the jacobi parameters of both @xmath27 and @xmath17 then follows automatically .",
    "unlike in the cases above , this class has not been explicitly described before .",
    "it consists of measures whose jacobi parameters do not depend on @xmath28 for @xmath29 ( except for the special case described in proposition  6 ) .",
    "even the fact that these ( pairs of ) measures form a two - state free convolution semigroup is apparently new .",
    "we show that these measures also have , in the two - state context , meixner - type properties .",
    "namely , just like the meixner and free meixner classes , this family includes the two - state versions of the normal , poisson , and binomial distributions ; their two - state cumulants satisfy a quadratic recursion ; they have a two - state laha - lukacs characterization @xcite ; and they appear as a subclass of the @xmath2 case of quadratic harnesses @xcite .    * acknowledgements . *",
