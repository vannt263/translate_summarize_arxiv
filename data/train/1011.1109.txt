    "for @xmath37 the mean size of the largest cycles was @xmath57 for the symmetric dispersal matrices generated , whereas for the asymmetric case all dispersal matrices already extended to the entire metapopulation ( i.e.  their mean size was @xmath41 ) .",

    "extinction statistics for the metapopulations with different values of the colonisation probability @xmath12 connected through dispersal matrices with @xmath34 and @xmath59 .",
    "the individual lines indicate the number of non - extinct simulations ( out of @xmath44 ) as a function of the simulation time .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the upper bound for the expectation value of the number of extinct simulation for cases where all simulations went extinct , @xmath60 , as derived in the manuscript text . from the figure it becomes evident , that the number of non - extinct simulations after an initial relaxation phase indeed decreases exponentially in time ( i.e.  linear in this logarithmic plot ) .",

    "these correlations in the past made the investigation of asymmetric dispersal highly dependent on the system of study , which was the main difficulty in understanding the role of dispersal asymmetry . in order to resolve this problem",
    "we suggest to discuss the symmetry of dispersal patterns at large scales e.g.  based on a definition similar to equation and the statistics of sources and sinks , the homogeneity of the dispersal network , and other features characterising the local flow of migrants _ jointly _ instead of in isolation .",
    "it was the aim of the present work , to clarify the role of asymmetric dispersal and its impact on metapopulation viability .",
    "in contrast to previous studies @xcite we see only weak effects of asymmetric connectivity on metapopulation extinction , which suggests that natural populations with asymmetric dispersal may not per se suffer from increased extinction risks .",
    "instead effects observed in simulations , real world data , or in the evaluation of management strategies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) might be reflected more significantly by other features of complex dispersal patterns . a promising path towards a discussion of potentially important features is taken in the investigations of the viability of metapopulations connected through a variety of different dispersal patterns as provided in @xcite .",
    "we expect that eventually only a theoretical analysis of the stochastic metapopulation model applied can reveal the features relevant for metapopulation viability .",
    "we kindly acknowledge comments by bernt wennberg on an early version of the manuscript and suggestions by kerstin johannesson on a more recent version .",
