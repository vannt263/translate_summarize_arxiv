    "in a strongly magnetized extremely relativistic medium , as in the magnetospheres of pulsars and black holes , energy density of the conducting matter can be neglected .",
    "when this is the case , the lorentz force vanishes and , thus , we can use force - free approximation for the medium .",
    "turbulence in this force - free magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) limit is the topic of this paper .",
    "the magnetospheres of pulsars and black holes ( see goldreich & julian 1969 ; blandford & znajek 1977 ; duncan & thompson 1992 ) or gamma - ray bursts ( see thompson 1994 ; lyutikov & blandford 2003 ) are examples of relevant astrophysical systems .    the force - free mhd admits two normal modes , alfven and fast modes ( see , for example , thompson & blaes 1998 ; komissarov 2002 ) . in the presence of a strong mean magnetic field",
    "@xmath4 , nonlinear interactions of these modes result in turbulence cascade . in this paper , we focus on alfvenic turbulence .    in the non - relativistic limit , goldreich & sridhar ( 1995 ) model provides a good theoretical description of strong alfvenic turbulence .",
    "the model predicts a kolmogorov energy spectrum ( @xmath5 ) and a scale - dependent anisotropy ( @xmath1 ) . here",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 are wavenumbers along and perpendicular to the local mean magnetic field directions , respectively .",
    "the scale - dependent anisotropy states that anisotropy is more pronounced at smaller scales .",
    "the model was first numerically confirmed by cho & vishniac ( 2000 ) .",
    "subsequent numerical studies and further discussions are given in maron & goldreich ( 2001 ) , cho , lazarian , vishniac ( 2002 ) , cho , lazarian , vishniac ( 2003 ) .",
    "thompson & blaes ( 1998 ) theoretically studied physics of force - free mhd turbulence .",
    "they introduced two new formulations for the force - free mhd and discussed various aspects of turbulence processes , including those of alfvenic turbulence .",
    "they found that force - free alfvenic mhd turbulence exhibits scaling relations very similar to the non - relativistic ones .",
    "that is to say , regarding to strong force - free alfvenic mhd turbulence , they argued that it has a kolmogorov spectrum and a goldreich - sridhar type anisotropy .    in this paper",
    ", we numerically study strong force - free alfvenic turbulence in flat space . in  2 , we describe our numerical methods . in  3 , we present results .",
    "we give discussion in  4 and conclusion in  5 .",
    "we solve the following system of equations : @xmath6 where @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the electric field and @xmath9 the poynting flux vector ( see komissarov 2002 ) .",
    "one can derive this system of equations from @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the dual tensor of the electromagnetic field , @xmath12 the fluid four velocity , and @xmath13 the stress - energy tensor of the electromagnetic field : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the metric tensor and @xmath16 is the electromagnetic field tensor .",
    "we ignore the stress - energy tensor of matter .",
    "we use flat geometry and units with @xmath17 .",
    "greek indices run from 1 to 4 .",
    "one can obtain the force - free condition from maxwell s equations and the energy - momentum equation : @xmath18 . from equation([eq_cond ] ) , one can derive @xmath19    we solve equations ( 1)-(6 ) using a muscl - type scheme with hll fluxes ( harten et al . 1983",
    "; in fact in force - free mhd these fluxes reduce to lax - friedrichs fluxes ) and monotonized central limiter ( see kurganov et al .",
    "the overall scheme is second - order accurate . after updating the system of equations along @xmath20 direction , we repeat similar procedures for @xmath21 and @xmath22 directions with appropriate rotation of indexes .",
    "gammie , mckinney , & tth ( 2003 ) used a similar scheme for general relativistic mhd and del zanna , bucciantini , & londrillo ( 2003 ) used a similar scheme to construct a higher - order scheme for special relativistic mhd .    while the magnetic field consists of the uniform background field and a fluctuating field , @xmath23 , electric field has only fluctuating one .",
    "the strength of the uniform background field , @xmath24 , is set to 1 .",
    "we use a grid of @xmath25 . at @xmath26 ,",
    "only alfven modes are present in the range @xmath27 in wavevector ( * k * ) space .",
    "the mhd condition @xmath28 is satisfied at @xmath26 .",
    "the energy density of the random magnetic and electric fields at @xmath26 is @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath30 at @xmath26 .",
    "figure 1 shows energy spectra of magnetic field . at @xmath26 (",
    "not shown ) only large scale ( i.e. small @xmath31 ) fourier modes are excited . at later times , energy cascades down to small scale ( i.e. large @xmath31 ) modes .",
    "after @xmath32 , the energy spectrum decreases without changing its slope .",
    "the spectrum at this stage is very close to a kolmogorov spectrum : @xmath33    in figure 2 , we plot contour diagram of the second - order structure function for magnetic field in a local frame , which is aligned with the local mean magnetic field @xmath34 : @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 and @xmath38 are unit vectors parallel and perpendicular to the local mean field @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "see cho et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and cho & vishniac ( 2000 ) for the detailed discussion of the local frame .",
    "the contour plot clearly shows existence of scale - dependent anisotropy : smaller eddies are more elongated . by analyzing the relation between the semi - major axis ( @xmath39 ) and the semi - minor axis ( @xmath40 ) of the contours",
    ", we can obtain the relation between @xmath2 and @xmath3 . the result in figure 3",
    "is consistent with the goldreich - sridhar type anisotropy : @xmath41    the electric field shows similar scalings as the magnetic field .",
    "our numerical results for spectrum and anisotropy are consistent with theoretical predictions by thompson & blaes ( 1998 ) .",
    "thompson & blaes ( 1998 ) derived scaling relations for force - free mhd turbulence , which are confirmed by our simulations .",
    "here we re - derive the scaling relations using a simple phenomenology .",
    "the magnetic and the electric fields follow the equations : @xmath42 where the current density @xmath43 is @xmath44 ( lyutikov 2003 ) .",
    "the current density @xmath43 in equation ( [ eq_dedt ] ) is essential for nonlinear interactions . in equation ( [ eq_j ] ) ,",
    "when @xmath45 and @xmath46 , the first term on the right side dominates for alfven turbulence .",
    "suppose that we have a alfven wave packet whose parallel size is @xmath47 and perpendicular size @xmath48 ( @xmath49 when anisotropy is present ) .",
    "this wave packet travels along the magnetic field line at the speed of @xmath50 . when this wave packet collides with opposite - traveling wave packets ( of similar size ) , the change of energy ( @xmath51 ) per collision is @xmath52 where we use equation ( [ eq_dedt ] ) to estimate @xmath53 .",
    "we assume @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and , hence , @xmath54 ( see equation ( [ eq_j ] ) ) .",
    "note that @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the wave period and @xmath58 the eddy turnover time .",
    "here we used @xmath59 .",
    "we consider two cases : @xmath60 and @xmath61 .    if @xmath62 , the resulting turbulence is strong ( see goldreich & sridhar 1995 for more discussion about _ non - relativistic _ alfvenic turbulence and the role of @xmath63 ) .",
    "our simulation satisfies this condition ( figure 4 ) . since @xmath64 ( equation [ [ eq_dee ] ] )",
    ", the condition @xmath65 implies that there is a balance between the hydrodynamic and the wave times - scales , which means that we can use either time - scale for the energy cascade time - scale .",
    "therefore , the constancy of spectral energy cascade rate in this case becomes @xmath66 which results in @xmath67 where we use @xmath68 . from @xmath69",
    ", we can obtain @xmath70 where we use @xmath71 .",
    "if @xmath61 , then the turbulence is weak : many collisions are required to make @xmath72 .",
    "thompson & blaes ( 1998 ) argued that force - free mhd turbulence in this regime has virtually constant @xmath2 and @xmath73 .",
    "see galtier et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for _ non - relativistic _ weak mhd turbulence .      at the beginning of the simulation",
    ", we have only alfven modes . as later times nonlinear interactions of alfven",
    "wave packets produce fast modes .",
    "figure 5 shows the amount of fast modes generated from the alfvenic turbulence .",
    "the ratio of fast to alfven energy is roughly 0.13 to 0.15 , which can be a measure of mode coupling between alfven and fast modes .",
    "see thompson & blaes ( 1998 ) for detailed discussion of mode coupling between alfven and fast modes .",
    "it is interesting that the energy ratio is not very much different from the energy ratio of compressible to incompressible modes in hydrodynamic ( porter , woodward , & pouquet 1998 ) , super - alfvenic non - relativistic mhd ( boldyrev , nordlund , padoan , 2002 ) , or mildly sub - alfvenic non - relativistic mhd ( cho & lazarian 2002 ) cases . unlike our current simulation , all these works used either isotropic initial condition or isotropic driving .",
    "cho & lazarian ( 2002 ) showed that fast modes generated from solenoidal components in _ non - relativistic _ mhd turbulence are isotopic when driving or initial condition is isotropic . in case of anisotropic driving or an anisotropic initial condition , fast modes can be anisotropic .",
    "but we expect that anisotropy of fast modes in that case is scale-_independent_.    can we derive a similar conclusion for force - free mhd ? in figure 6 , we plot contour diagram of the second - order structure function for fast modes . as in the case of alfven modes , we can assume that contours represent eddy shapes .",
    "contours do show anisotropy .",
    "but , the anisotropy does not show strong scale - dependence .      in equation ( [ eq_dedt ] ) , we are not interested in the parallel components of the right hand side of the equation .",
    "perpendicular components are important for the evolution of the electric field .",
    "therefore let us consider only the perpendicular components of the equation .",
    "we also assume that we have only alfven modes .",
    "then the three terms on the right hand side of equation ( [ eq_j ] ) can be approximated by @xmath74 where we assumed @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , the dominant term is the first term .",
    "from this we can easily show that the spectrum of the current density follows @xmath76 on the other hand , the charge density follows @xmath77 or @xmath78",
    "using numerical simulations , we have studied 3 dimensional force - free mhd turbulence .",
    "we have found that energy spectrum is compatible with a kolmogorov spectrum : @xmath5 .",
    "we have calculated anisotropy and found a goldreich - sridhar type anisotropy : @xmath79 .",
    "these findings are consistent with earlier theoretical studies in thompson & blaes ( 1998 ) ."
