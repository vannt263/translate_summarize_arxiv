    "measurements of the intensity fluctuations in this diffused background provide us a three dimensional probe of the large scale structures over a large redshift range in the post - reionization era ( @xmath14 ) @xcite .",
    "the advantage of studying the 21-cm emission in the post - reionization era lies in the fact that the modulation of the signal due to complicated ionizing fields is less and the 21-cm power spectrum is directly proportional to the matter power spectrum which enhances its usefulness as a probe of cosmology @xcite .",
    "this technique provides an independent estimate of various cosmological parameters @xcite .",

    "further , the amplitude of the expected signal @xmath23 is very sensitive to both @xmath27 and @xmath29 , and it is crucial to have prior estimates of these parameters in order to make precise predictions for the upcoming experiments @xcite .",
