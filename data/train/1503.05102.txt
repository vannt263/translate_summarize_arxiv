    "this is clearly impossible since @xmath134 .",

    "this interpretation is also confirmed by the observation that the term that forbids asymptotic solutions in the case of polytropic equations of state is directly connected with the non - vanishing rest - mass of the gas particles .    of course , the simplest ( and perhaps slightly naive ) explanation would be to refer to the behavior of radial null and time - like geodesics in the schwarzschild  anti - de sitter spacetimes .",
