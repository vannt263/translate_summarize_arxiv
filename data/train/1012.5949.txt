    "the idea of molecular state of mesons was first raised in @xcite , and it was systematicly studied by n.a.tornqvist in @xcite .",
    "this idea is often used to study the resonances with `` strange '' decay property as well as a mass closed to a respective two - meson threshold .",
    "one of the newest example is the hadron state of x(3872 ) .",
    "a lot of papers suggested it to be a molecular state of @xmath4 .",
    "the x(3872 ) was first discovered by belle @xcite in @xmath5 channel , and soon confirmed by cdf @xcite , do @xcite , and babar @xcite .",
    "its mass is @xmath6 and width is @xmath7 .",
    "the study of the angular distributions and correlations of the @xmath5 final state shows that @xmath8 and @xmath9 are two possible quantum number assignments .",
    "since the @xmath10 @xmath11 state @xmath12 in quark model is at least 50mev heavier than x(3872 ) and the decay of a pure charmonium state into @xmath13 violates isospin symmetry , it is very difficult to assign x(3872 ) into charmonium .",
    "many new reasonable explanations were raised , such as explaining x(3872 ) as a molecule state , a hybrid charmonium , a diquark anti - diquark bound state , a tetraquark state or so . since x(3872 ) s mass is just a half mev below @xmath14 mass threshold and its branch width in the @xmath15 channel is ten times larger than that in the @xmath5 channel , the molecule picture becomes one of most favorable model though this picture meets a problem in explanation of the decay @xmath16 .    the molecule picture for x(3872 ) have been discussed in many papers @xcite . as the proximity of x(3872 ) and @xmath4 threshold , the x(3872 ) resonance may be just a loosely bound state of @xmath4 . such loosely bound state",
    "is always built in a potential model . in @xcite swanson suggested the potential is mainly supplied by exchanging pion mesons and quarks since the one pion exchange is not good enough to bind @xmath4 together . in @xcite the authors traced back to pion exchange potential of deuteron in nuclear physics , where the single pion exchange can not bind proton and neutron either . only by introducing the sigma meson exchange",
    "would the deuteron to be stable .",
    "so they had introduced the sigma meson exchange in the @xmath4 .",
    "however their result showed the situation became worse .",
    "a bound state of @xmath4 could appear only when the parameter of energy cutoff @xmath17 become unphysically large .",
    "their results disfavors the x(3872 ) being a bound state of @xmath18 . in c.e.thomas and",
    "f.e.close calculated the pion exchange of @xmath19 and @xmath20 in the quark level .",
    "and they did find a bound state in their potential . and",
    "the bind energy is sensitive to the energy cutoff parameter @xmath17 and the coupling constant @xmath21 . beside the pion exchange , other mesons exchange , such as @xmath22 , @xmath23,@xmath24 and",
    "@xmath25 exchange between @xmath19 and @xmath20 , has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the authors found a loosely bound state of @xmath26 when the energy cutoff @xmath27 .",
    "their results favors the x(3872 ) being a loosely bound state of @xmath19 and @xmath20 mesons .    until now ,",
    "from both of the theory and the experiment , there are two opposite opinions about the molecule picture of the resonance x(3872 ) .",
    "however , more new resonances , such as x , y , z series of the charmonium , are found continuously in experiments .",
    "some of them are also difficult to be explained as the pure @xmath28 states .",
    "therefore , regardless of whether the x(3872 ) is a molecule state of @xmath29 , the interaction between @xmath19 mesons in hadron level will be still interesting .",
    "our work starts from the thinking of the two - pion exchange potential between @xmath19 and(or ) @xmath30 mesons . in nuclear physics",
    ", the two - pion exchange potential plays an important role in explaining the inside structure of nucleons .",
    "we guess such effects are also important between the @xmath19 and(or ) @xmath20 mesons though it was argued that the chiral perturbative expansion converges more quickly in heavy mesons . at first",
    ", we calculate the two - pion exchange potential between @xmath19 and @xmath31 by using gaussian type form factor to regularize loop integral and study the bound state of @xmath32 .",
    "we find , though there is not the one - pion exchange potential , a stable bound state of @xmath32 can exist at @xmath33 .",
    "then we perform the similar calculation for the two - pion exchange potential between @xmath19 and @xmath34",
    ". meanwhile , we also use the same form factor to regularize the one - pion exchange potential between @xmath19 and @xmath34 for comparison .",
    "we find the chiral perturbative expansion is quite convergent even when the cutoff @xmath35 .",
    "this result shows the regularization scheme works quite well .",
    "similarly , we use the obtained potential to study the bound state of @xmath36 and find a stable bound state exists only when @xmath37 . this result is better than @xcite though it is still negative for the existence of the molecule x(3872 ) .",
    "our results show , even in heavy mesons , the multi - pion exchange is still important .",
    "we organize our paper as the following . in section 2 , we give the effective lagrangian that we use in the calculation .",
    "this lagrangian is derived from the most general one given by mark.b.wise in @xcite . in section 3 ,",
    "we first calculate the two - pion exchange potential between @xmath0 , then we numerically solve the schrdinger equation to find whether this potential can form a bound state . in section 4 , we calculate the potential of @xmath1 and discuss the possibility of the existence of the molecule x(3872 ) . in section 5 ,",
    "we extend our discussion to the case of the @xmath38 and @xmath39 mesons .",
    "finally we give a brief summary and conclusion .",
    "the effective chiral lagrangian for heavy mesons was first given by mark.b.wise@xcite : @xmath40    where    @xmath41    @xmath42    and the @xmath43 and @xmath44 are meson fields and @xmath45 is the nonlinear realization of the su(3 ) goldstone fields .    for our purpose , we can expand the lagrangian ( [ la ] ) as    @xmath46    where @xmath47 , @xmath48 is the @xmath49 constant , @xmath21 is the coupling constant(we use @xmath50 in the calculation below ) .",
    "same as in @xcite , the factors of @xmath51and @xmath52 have been absorbed into the @xmath43 and @xmath44 fields , and the lagrangian is independent of the heavy - quark mass .",
    "now we start to calculate the potential of @xmath19 and @xmath31 .",
    "since there is no one - pion exchange between @xmath19 and @xmath31 mesons , we are directly going to calculate the two - pion exchange potential .",
    "there are four two pion - exchange feynman diagrams as showed in fig.1 .",
    "fig.1 the parallel box(a ) , crossing box(b ) , triangle(c ) and two - pion loop(d ) digram .",
    "our calculation is very similar to that for the nucleon - nucleon potential@xcite@xcite , except that the parallel box diagram in our case is a little bit different . in the nucleon case",
    ", it should be careful to extract \" iterated one - pion exchange  contribution@xcite .",
    "therefore , the `` old - fashioned '' time - ordered perturbation theory is widely used @xcite .",
    "however , there is not one - pion exchange between @xmath19 and @xmath31 mesons , we can calculate directly using covariant perturbation theory .    the mass difference",
    "@xmath53 plays an important role in our calculation , so we write the propagator of the @xmath30 meson like ( for example of fig.1a ) @xmath54 where we use the conditions @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "then the rest calculation can be carried out directly like in @xcite .      as usual",
    ", we work in center - of - mass(c.m . )",
    "system . and",
    "denote @xmath57 as the intial momentum , @xmath58 as the final momentum , @xmath59 as the transferred momentum . in the following",
    ", we will use the symbols :    @xmath60    @xmath61    @xmath62    after straightforward calculating each figure in fig.1 , we can get the potentials in momentum space :    for the diagram a in fig.1 , parallel box digram :    @xmath63\\frac{1}{\\omega_{2}^{2}-\\omega_{1}^{2}}\\ ] ]    the diagram b in fig.1 , crossing box digram :    @xmath64\\frac{1}{\\omega_{2}^{2}-\\omega_{1}^{2}}\\ ] ]    the diagram c in fig.1 :    @xmath65    the diagram d in fig.1 :    @xmath66    where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the isospin matrices in the line 1 and 2 respectively .    to transform the potential from momentum space into coordinate space ,",
    "the momentum space cutoff is used .",
    "this is a conceptually simple way and is mathematically easy too , we just need to bring a cutoff function and choose a suitable cutoff energy . although it is not theoretically exactly true in physics , but this has been used widely in phenomenology physics , and is believed to be consistent with how the real world is going on . like in the reference@xcite@xcite , we add a gaussian form factor @xmath69 in each vertex ( in momentum space ) in the diagrams of fig.1 , that can regulate the loop integrals in the potential .",
    "thus , the integrals can easily be carried out numerically .",
    "when we do the transformation , we use the formulas and techniques in ref @xcite . here",
    "we only give the simple potential formulas .",
    "after the fourier transformation , the potential between @xmath0 can be obtained as following ( where the function @xmath70 can be found in appendix ) : @xmath71    where    @xmath72\\\\ v_{b}(r ) & = & -\\frac{1}{16}\\frac{1}{\\pi}(\\frac{g}{f})^{4}(3 + 8t_{1}\\cdot t_{2})\\int d\\lambda\\frac{a^{2}-\\lambda^{2}}{(a^{2}+\\lambda^{2})^{2}}\\left[\\frac{2}{r^{2}}f^{'}\\left(\\lambda , r\\right)f^{'}\\left(\\lambda , r\\right)+f^{''}\\left(\\lambda , r\\right)f^{''}\\left(\\lambda , r\\right)\\right]\\\\ v_{c}(r ) & = & \\frac{1}{16}\\frac{1}{\\pi}(\\frac{2g}{f})^{2}\\frac{2}{f^{2}}t_{1}\\cdot t_{2}\\int d\\lambda\\frac{\\lambda^{2}}{a^{2}+\\lambda^{2}}\\left(f^{'}\\left(\\lambda , r\\right)f^{'}\\left(\\lambda , r\\right)\\right)\\\\ v_{d}(r ) & = & \\frac{2}{4\\pi}\\frac{1}{f^{4}}t_{1}\\cdot t_{2}\\int d\\lambda\\lambda^{2}f^{2}(\\lambda , r)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the potential is a function of energy cutoff parameter @xmath17 . in fig.2",
    "we show the potential with different @xmath17 .",
    "we can see the potential is sensitive to the cutoff @xmath17 .",
    "the value of @xmath17 is not known right now , however , it is generally believed that @xmath17 is around 1gev . at most",
    ", it should not be larger than the mass of the d meson .",
    "we will discuss its value in the following .",
    "it should be also mentioned here that , what we deal with the @xmath0 potential is also available for the @xmath73 potential , i.e. , there is no difference between @xmath0 and @xmath73 up to the order of the two - pion exchange . therefore , in the following what we talk about @xmath0 is also valid for @xmath74 .",
    "fig.2 the potentials of @xmath0 with various @xmath17 .",
    "the left is in the channel i=0 and the right is in the channel i=1 .",
    "we numerically solve the schrdinger equation to find the bound state of @xmath0 .",
    "our result is certainly dependent on @xmath17 . for the channel i=0",
    ", we find that a stable bound state exists only when @xmath75 . for i=1 , a stable bound",
    "appear after @xmath17 increases to 2750mev .",
    "we summarize our results in table.1 .",
    "although the potential in both of the channel i=0,1 is attractive , it seems that it is not deep enough to bound a molecule state if we believe @xmath17 should not be larger than 1gev .",
    "however , the experimental data about nucleus support a larger @xmath27 @xcite . considering the mass of the d meson is heavier than nucleon s , it could not completely exclude the possibility of the existence of the @xmath0 molecule state .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table.4 the bind energy of the @xmath3 bound state in the channel i=1 and the corresponding @xmath17 .",
    "in this work , we calculate the two - pion exchange potential between @xmath19 mesons and(or ) @xmath20 mesons by using gaussian type form factor to regularize loop integrals .",
    "we check the convergence of the chiral perturbative expansion by varying the cutoff @xmath17 and make sure the validness of the regularization scheme . by using the obtained potentials we discuss the possibility of the existence of the heavy - meson molecule states .",
    "opposite to the naive expectation , we find the existence of the @xmath32 molecule state is more possible than that of the @xmath76 molecule state .",
    "the existence of a @xmath32 molecule state requires a large cutoff @xmath33 .",
    "comparing with @xmath27 in the deuteron case@xcite , a @xmath32 molecule state indeed is not favorable .",
    "however , if we consider the fact that the @xmath19 meson is heavier than nucleons , we can not rule out completely the possibility of the existence of the @xmath32 molecule states .",
    "similar to @xcite , our result excludes that the pure - pion exchange can bind @xmath19 and @xmath77 mesons as a molecule state .",
    "we also extend our study to the case of @xmath38 and @xmath78 mesons .",
    "since the mass of @xmath38 meson is much heavier than the d meson s , the existence of the @xmath38 and(or ) @xmath78 molecule state is more possible than that in the @xmath19 meson case .",
    "however , the situation does not become much better than that of the @xmath32 case .",
