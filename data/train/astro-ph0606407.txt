    "from many previous studies based on fundamental planes and colour - magnitude ( cm ) relations in clusters up to @xmath11 , it appears that major star formation in the brightest cluster galaxies was virtually completed by @xmath12 ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , one expects to find proto - clusters dominated by already passively evolving galaxies even beyond @xmath12 .",
    "searching for such ancestors of present - day rich clusters of galaxies is not an easy task , however , since it requires a large volume to survey in order to find such rare objects .",
    "radio galaxies can be viewed as good markers of such high density regions at high redshifts , since they are among the most massive galaxies at any redshift ( @xmath13 , @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , about half of powerful radio galaxies at intermediate redshift inhabit rich environments ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the hypothesis that radio galaxies point us towards proto - clusters at high redshift has been further supported by the recent finding of a correlation between agn activity and bulge mass ( magorrian relation , @xcite ) . given this relation ,",
    "it is natural to imagine that massive cd galaxies sitting in deep potential well of clusters tend to host massive powerful agn and hence they are viewed as radio galaxies at high redshift .",
    "narrow - band surveys of ly@xmath14 emitters around high-@xmath15 radio galaxies have been intensively conducted by the leiden group ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) over many years who discovered a large number of emitters at the same redshifts of the radio galaxies , and a large fraction of those emitters have been spectroscopically confirmed ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these overdense regions of star forming galaxies are embedded in large scale structures at high redshifts and are likely to evolve into massive systems at the present day , such as clusters of galaxies .",
    "alternative approach is to find evolved populations at longer wavelength .",
    "this is complementary to the emitter surveys .",
    "@xcite found an excess of red galaxies with @xmath16 around radio - loud agns at @xmath17 . @xcite and @xcite also found statistical overdensities of red galaxies around radio - loud agns at @xmath18 in near - infrared surveys . @xcite also report overdensities of red galaxies in optical ",
    "nir colours around 13 qso s at @xmath19 .",
    "these studies indicate that there is also an excess of _ evolved _ population around the high-@xmath15 radio galaxies , as expected if they are embedded in proto - clusters .",
    "we take the second approach and extend the previous analyses to higher redshift based on the near - infrared ( nir ) imaging . and in this _ letter _ , we report a discovery of the overdensity of nir - selected galaxies in the fields of six radio galaxies at @xmath0 .    the vega - referred magnitude system is used throughout the paper .",
    "we performed the @xmath20-bands imaging observations of the fields of the five radio galaxies and one radio - loud qso ( 4c + 04.81 ) at @xmath0 with cisco @xcite on the subaru telescope on 2005 march 21 - 22 and september 19 - 20 .",
    "cisco has the field of view of about 1.8 @xmath21 1.8 arcmin@xmath22 with 0.105  pixel scale .",
    "the target information and exposure time are given in table [ tab : obs ] .",
    "the weather conditions were stable during the observations , and seeing sizes were between 0.3  and 0.7  ( fwhm ) .",
    "the data were reduced using the iraf software package as described in @xcite .",
    "we performed flat - fielding with the superflat frames for the cisco data @xcite , and subtracted the dark and sky background .",
    "then the data were co - registered and combined .",
    "we also reduced the archival cisco data for 4c -00.62 ( 5600 sec in @xmath23-band and 1040 sec in @xmath24-band ) and 4c + 23.56 ( 5600 sec in @xmath23-band , 1600 sec in @xmath25-band and 1200 sec in @xmath24-band ) and combined together .",
    "these are included in table [ tab : obs ] .",
    "our final multi - band combined images have the slightly smaller field of view of about 1.6 @xmath21 1.6 arcmin@xmath22 , which corresponds to @xmath26mpc on a side at @xmath0 ( we assume a cosmology of @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) . for each target",
    ", the images were convolved with a gaussian kernel to match the psfs to the worst one .",
    "the final psf for each target is also given in table [ tab : obs ] .",
    ".summary of the observational data [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     different types of the symbols correspond to different colour selections .",
    "filled circles show the galaxies which satisfy the both criteria simultaneously .",
    "open circles represent the objects which meet only the second criterion , and open triangle indicate those which meet only the first one ( i.e. , drgs which do not satisfy the second colour - cut hence are likely to be background red objects )",
    ". all the others are shown by crosses .",
    "it is notable that all the five radio galaxies at @xmath0 ( squares in figure [ fig : jhk ] ) satisfy the two - colours cut ( the remaining square outside of the top left corner is the radio - loud qso 4c  + 04.81 ) .",
    "this supports that our colour selection works reasonably well , even though the strong emission lines from the agn component could affect their colours @xcite .",
    "0.95    table [ tab : num ] list the number densities of the colour - selected galaxies with @xmath29 in each radio galaxy field .",
    "poisson errors of these densities are also shown .",
    "in addition , we used the public goods - south data ( see next section for the detail ) to estimate the degree of the field - to - field variance for the observed area of each radio galaxy field .",
    "a random field of 1.6@xmath211.6 arcmin@xmath22 was selected from goods - s field and the numbers of color - selected galaxies were counted .",
    "we repeated this procedure and measured the one sigma variance in the numbers .",
    "such field - to - field variance is shown as errors in the number densities for the goods - s field in table [ tab : num ] and figure [ fig : nc ] ( see next section ) .",
    "it is clear that the two fields , 4c  @xmath3000.62 and 4c  + 23.56 , contain quite high number densities of galaxies that satisfy the two - colours cut ( eq .  2 ) and they are among the most plausible proto - cluster candidates . in particular , the 4c  + 23.56 field has numerous red galaxies with @xmath9 .",
    "in fact , @xcite also reported a high density of red galaxies with @xmath31 in the central 1.25 arcmin@xmath22 field around 4c  + 23.56 . on the other hand , mrc 0406 - 244 field has few colour - selected galaxy .",
    "there seems to be the variety of the density of the colour - selected galaxies in each radio galaxy field . in the following section",
    ", we compare those number densities of these colour - selected galaxies in the radio galaxies fields with those in a general blank field .",
    "in order to quantify the overdensities of the colour - selected galaxies around the high-@xmath15 radio galaxies , we use goods - south survey @xcite as a comparison field for which the public vlt / isaac ver1.5 data are available .    the @xmath20-bands data of the goods - s has similar depths and similar psf to those of our cisco data , and are suitable for our purpose .",
    "the area used in the analysis is 94 arcmin@xmath22 , which is significantly larger than that of our radio galaxies fields .",
    "we performed the source detection and photometry exactly in the same manner as for the cisco images .    in figure",
    "[ fig : nc ] , we compare the cumulative @xmath24-band number densities of the colour - selected galaxies in the radio galaxies fields and in the goods - s field . in the left panel ,",
    "we plot the number counts of all the @xmath24-selected objects and the galaxies with @xmath9 .",
    "note that the excess of all the @xmath24-selected objects at the bright end ( @xmath32 ) is due to stars in the radio galaxies fields , especially in the case of 4c  + 23.56 field which contain numerous stellar objects ( figure [ fig : jk ] ) .",
    "the number counts of galaxies that are not selected by any color cut ( `` the others '' in figure [ fig : jhk ] ) in the radio galaxies fields and goods - s are consistent , if we exclude these star excess in the radio galaxies fields by the selection such as @xmath33 or @xmath34 .",
    "the excess of all the @xmath24-selected objects at @xmath34 is caused by the overdensity of the color - selected galaxies as seen below .",
    "0.75    the cumulative number density of the galaxies with @xmath9 in all the six radio galaxies fields significantly exceeds that in the goods - s at @xmath35 .",
    "the former density is twice higher than the latter over the magnitude range of @xmath8 .",
    "the middle panel of figure [ fig : nc ] shows the cases for galaxies selected by the two - colours cut in @xmath20 ( open circles ) .",
    "the galaxies shown by the filled circles have been further selected as having red colours of @xmath9 in addition to the two - colours cut .",
    "we see a significant excess in densities of the @xmath20-selected galaxies around the radio galaxies .",
    "in fact , the overdensity is more than factor of three compared to that of the goods - s at @xmath10 .",
    "red subsample with @xmath9 also shows similar overdensity of about factor three over the range of @xmath36 .    in the right panel of figure",
    "[ fig : nc ] , we show the same plots as in the middle panel but for only the two highly plausible proto - cluster candidates , namely 4c  @xmath3000.62 and 4c  + 23.56 fields .",
    "the overdensity of galaxies selected by the two - colours cut is now more than factor of five compared to the general field .",
    "the excess is even higher for the red subsample with @xmath9 .",
    "such strong excess of nir - selected ( approximately stellar mass - selected ) galaxies indicates that these fields are likely to be proto - clusters with evolved populations associated to the central radio galaxies at @xmath0 , which would evolve into rich clusters of galaxies today dominated by old passively evolving galaxies .",
    "in fact , these two fields mainly cause the significant excess seen in all the six fields , while the average density of the other four fields is consistent with that of the general field within the uncertainty ( see table [ tab : num ] ) . in figure [ fig : xy ] , we show the spatial distribution of the colour - selected galaxies in the two proto - cluster candidates around the @xmath0 radio galaxies . despite of poor statistics",
    ", it is suggestive that those colour - selected member candidates are distributed non - uniformly around the central radio galaxies .",
    "such non - uniform distribution of galaxies in proto - clusters has also been reported recently by @xcite who found a filamentary structure in the spatial distribution of spectroscopically confirmed ly@xmath14 emitters associated to a radio galaxy at @xmath37 .",
    "the mass - selected members of proto - clusters may similarly trace such filamentary structures at least over the scale of @xmath38mpc at this observed epoch .",
    "we searched for proto - clusters around the radio galaxies at @xmath0 based on the deep @xmath20-bands imaging taken with subaru telescope . in order to largely subtract foreground / background contamination and have high contrast of proto - cluster member candidates associated to the radio galaxies",
    ", we applied several colour selections ; ( 1 ) a widely used single colour cut of @xmath9 and ( 2 ) our new two - colours cut with @xmath20-bands . in both cases , we see a clear excess in the number densities of colour - selected galaxies in the observed radio galaxies fields compared to the general field goods - south .",
    "the overdensity in the six combined radio galaxies fields is about factor of two for the galaxies with @xmath9 and is factor of three for those selected by the two - colours cut , although the variety of the overdensity in each field is also seen .",
    "in particular , two radio galaxies fields , namely 4c  @xmath3000.62 and 4c  + 23.56 , show the highest overdensities of the colour - selected galaxies of more than factor of five .",
    "therefore , we are likely to be witnessing the assembly and formation of proto - clusters with many evolved galaxies at @xmath0 associated to the radio galaxies .",
