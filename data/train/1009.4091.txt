    "the last decade has seen an explosive growth in wireless network services and consequently an increasing demand of high data rates on wireless networks .",
    "multiple - input - multiple - output ( mimo )  @xcite communication has generated a lot of interest in recent years for providing such high data rates .",
    "it offers enormous capacity gains as compared to traditional single input single output ( siso ) communication  @xcite .",
    "the importance of mimo technology can be seen from the fact that ieee @xmath1 is actively pursuing @xmath1n which promises high throughput using multiple antennas . to date",
    ", a significant amount of work on mimo has been done in quantifying its capacity limits under different channel conditions , antenna settings , etc . , using classical information theory under the assumption of infinite delay  @xcite .",
    "this assumption has been working well for delay insensitive applications and for channels without memory .",
    "however , recently there has been a rapid growth of delay sensitive applications such as voip and ip video , which are also run on wireless networks where mimo is being deployed .",
    "in addition , mimo links have been considered for delay critical applications such as manets  @xcite , for they overcome the problems of low system throughput .",
    "hence , it is also essential to provide quality of service ( qos ) ( such as delay bounds ) on mimo links in addition to high data rates . for this , a critical issue is to analyze their flow level performance .",
    "the focus of this paper is on flow - level delay analysis of a spatial multiplexing mimo wireless channel .",
    "specifically , we derive probabilistic delay bounds for the channel and show the impact of increasing the number of antennas on the delay bounds under various conditions , such as channel burstiness , signal strength and fading speed .",
    "the theory , which the analysis is based on , is moment generating function ( mgf ) based stochastic network calculus . in stochastic network calculus , a communication system is described by the arrivals at the ingress , the service it provides and the departures at the egress .",
    "the stochastic network calculus framework provides the freedom of a general separation in the characterization of arrivals and service , which allows the combination of different arrival and service models .",
    "it enables the derivation of flow level performance bounds such as @xmath2 \\le \\varepsilon$ ] , i.e. the probability of the delay exceeding a certain threshold @xmath3 is upper bounded by @xmath4 .",
    "it also incorporates the ability to characterize multiplexing and demultiplexing of flows and the derivation of end - to - end performance bounds through composition @xcite .",
    "the mgf based stochastic network calculus , as proposed in @xcite , established and developed in @xcite , enables more easily the consideration of statistical independence between arrivals and system service and between the service provided at consecutive hops .",
    "a comprehensive view of stochastic network calculus can be found in @xcite , @xcite .    in the literature ,",
    "many works , which are related to qos analysis of wireless channels , can be found .",
    "they include link - layer channel modeling @xcite , where the focus has been on developing models for channels with memory , which capture the bursty nature of errors on wireless channels .",
    "effective bandwidth theory has been employed to analyze wireless channels @xcite .",
    "the concept of effective capacity , which is directly related to effective bandwidth , was developed in @xcite for wireless channel qos analysis . by using large deviations techniques",
    "a similar approach was developed in  @xcite to relate effective bandwidth theory to channel capacity and derive delay bounds in conjunction with markov modeling .",
    "in addition , _ stochastic network calculus _ , which as a more general theory covers effective bandwidth and effective capacity , has recently been applied for qos analysis of wireless channels @xcite . however , none of these works analyzed mimo channels .",
    "there are two transmission techniques for mimo systems .",
    "_ spatial multiplexing _ is used to increase throughput by transmitting _",
    "independent _ data flows over different antennas .",
    "_ spatial diversity",
    "_ , on the other hand , increases reliability by transmitting _",
    "redundant _ flows of information in parallel .",
    "there has been some works reported for mimo diversity systems  @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the concept of effective capacity has been used to carry out qos analysis of mimo diversity systems using finite state markov chains to describe the _ received signal to noise ratio _ ( snr ) . however , to the best of our knowledge , qos analysis of mimo systems in spatial multiplexing mode is still missing .",
    "in addition , it is known that , besides average received snr , the mimo _ channel matrix _ , which describes the scattering environment , has a profound effect on channel capacity  @xcite and hence the delay .",
    "the contribution of this work is as follows .",
    "( 1 ) we present qos analysis of a mimo system under _ spatial multiplexing _ mode . in the analysis",
    ", we incorporate statistical independence of arriving traffic and the service provided by the channel .",
    "we also present results for end - to - end performance in a multi - hop scenario , where statistical independence of consecutive hops holds .",
    "( 2 ) the _ effect of individual channel matrix elements _ on delay bounds is studied keeping the received snr constant .",
    "( 3 ) we provide a method of aggregating the states based on degrees of freedom available in the mimo system , which results in _ reduction of the state space _ from @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",

    "as discussed above an increase in the number of antennas leads in the best case to a linear increase in channel capacity .",

    "[ fig : fspeeddelay ] .",
    "it shows that the delay bound deteriorates with slow fading significantly .",
    "this is due to the fact that a slow fading channel , which corresponds to small values of @xmath69 , produces large burst errors due to its longer memory .",
    "the notable thing is that for slow fading the difference in delay bounds between n = 2 and n = 3 is large and for higher fading speeds , which corresponds to a channel nearly without memory , the profit from extra spatial paths diminishes . as the first order capacity given in tab .",
    "[ tab : fading_meancap ] stays constant over the range of fading speeds , which is implied by the fixed @xmath115 , this difference in delay bounds might be due to the higher order statistics of capacity . furthermore , the impact of statistical multiplexing between the spatial paths , which is higher for @xmath116 , is apparent in the slow fading regime where the markov chain changes states less frequently .",
    "[ fig : dly_snr_n2 ] shows results on the relation of the delay bound and snr .",
    "one can observe a rapid growth of the delay bound occurring for small snr values .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the snr governs the capacity expression ( [ e : mimoepcapformulalogdet ] ) such that for a constant arrival rate the decrease in snr corresponds to an increase in utilization , which , in turn for high values , causes large delays to occur more often and stochastic delay bounds to grow quickly .    for fig .",

    "this scenario describes an ad - hoc wireless network , where we use homogeneous links for simplicity , i.e. all links are operated by @xmath0x@xmath0 mimo in spatial multiplexing mode , here @xmath117 .",
