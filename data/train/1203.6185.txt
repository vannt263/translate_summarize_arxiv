    "in numerical relativity , einstein s equation can be solved numerically without any approximation or symmetry assumption , with the aid of a supercomputer . besides the massive computational cost involved ,",
    "the stability issue is also a nontrivial problem in the numerical calculations for einstein s equation . breakthroughs in 2005 and 2006 @xcite shifted the development of numerical relativity to a higher pace .",
    "now many numerical relativity groups around the world are capable of evolving black hole ( bh ) systems with high accuracy .",
    "moreover , a variety of interesting topics , such as long term gravitational waves @xcite , gravitational radiation induced bh recoil @xcite , the estimation of the final bh s mass and the spin of binary black hole systems @xcite , and so on @xcite , have been extensively studied over the past few years .",
    "numerical relativity has now become an efficient tool in the research of general relativity and astrophysics .",
    "gravitational wave detection is an important task for the further development of gravitation and general relativity .",
    "currently , the ground - based laser interferometers such as ligo @xcite , virgo @xcite , geo600 @xcite , and tama @xcite are already up and running , while the space - based laser interferometer lisa @xcite is still under construction .",
    "progress in detection has made the requirement for the theoretical prediction of gravitational wave signal more and more urgent .",
    "numerical relativity plays a key role in both aiding gravitational wave data analysis @xcite and helping to build template banks of the phenomenological waveform @xcite for the most important gravitational source  binary black hole ( bbh ) coalescence .    in most theoretical and numerical calculations ,",
    "bbhs are treated as isolated systems , although stellar - mass bbhs usually are located in a galaxy with a super - massive bh in the center .",
    "the validity of the approximation is based on the idea that a stellar - mass bbh is usually far away from the super - massive bh whose gravitational potential is negligible compared with the strength of the gravitational field produced by the bbh itself . besides the possible super - massive - bh environment , it is possible for stellar - mass bbhs to be affected by other stellar bhs and/or stars , especially in globular clusters .",
    "although the background potentials in these scenarios are usually much weaker than the gravitational field of the bbh , it still remains as an interesting question as to how valid the approximation is , and to what extent the approximation holds .",
    "there have been several studies of the three - bh problem with numerical relativity from various standpoints @xcite .",
    "the results all indicate that the dynamics and behavior displayed by three bhs are qualitatively different from those of an isolated bbh .",
    "for example , in @xcite , numerically generated bbh initial data sets and post - newtonian techniques are utilized to show that the presence of a third bh has non - negligible relativistic effects on the location of a bbh s innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) , an increase in merging time , and an amplification of the gravitational radiation emitted from the bbh . as we all know , information about a bbh such as the initial / final spin , the mass ratio and the orientation can be extracted from a detected gravitational wave by comparing the wave train with the waveform template in the data bank calculated with theoretical models . without proper consideration of the environmental effect on the bbh evolution and",
    "thus on the distortion of the gravitational wave , the extracted information might be incorrect and possibly lead to misinterpretation and/or misunderstanding .",
    "it is also possible that the nonlinearity of general relativity might give rise to a qualitatively difference due to a tiny difference , just like in other nonlinear systems @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to seek any possible nonlinear effects in the three - bh problem which might be helpful in distinguishing among different scenarios @xcite .    in this work , instead of",
    "the heavily numerical calculation of the evolution of a three - bh problem with a fully relativistic treatment , we use a perturbational scheme , along with numerical simulations , to investigate the effect of the background gravitational potential on the evolution of a bbh , especially on the waveform of the gravitational radiation . as with our previously preliminary study @xcite , the scenarios we considered include the head - on collision and the inspiral - to - merger process of a bbh , considered as the two limits in all possible configurations , in the cases where the bbh is freefalling towards or circularly orbiting around the third large bh .",
    "our results show that the existence of the background gravitational potential changes the arrival time of the gravitational wavefront of the bbh , prolongs the wavelength , and increases the gravitational radiation energy . and",
    "most interestingly , the background gravitational potential induces the higher - order modes of the gravitational wave of a bbh .",
    "these interesting phenomena can be explained by the gravitational redshift effect and the change of eccentricity of the bbh s orbit from the gravitational potential .",
    "these phenomena could introduce complications or even mislead people in the identification of the source of gravitational wave without further studies to distinguish the signatures of a bbh with a background gravitational potential from the ones of an isolated bbh .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ secii ] , we give a description of the code configuration , the gauge condition , the initial data , and especially the perturbational method for the outer boundary condition . then we consider the four special cases for the evolution of a bbh under the influence of a third large bh , followed by a numerical analysis of these results one by one in sec .",
    "[ seciii ] .",
    "we summarize and discuss the viability of the perturbational method and the implications of our findings in sec .",
    "[ seciv ] . throughout the paper ,",
    "the geometric units with @xmath0 are used .",
    "as a preliminary study of the background effect , we investigate the dynamics and the waveforms of a bbh system in a potential background which comes from a third , distant and massive bh . for this three - body system , we do not simulate its three - body dynamics with a fully relativistic treatment as in @xcite . instead , a method of perturbation is adopted for the problem since the gravitational field from the third bh to the bbh is weaker than the field between the two small bhs in the bbh .",
    "it is obvious that the effect of the third massive bh is stronger if it has larger mass @xmath1 or the shorter distance @xmath2 to the binary system , or both .",
    "therefore , we would use the ratio of @xmath3 to denote the strength of the gravitational background resulting from the third massive bh .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] illustrates the configuration considered in this work .",
    "our amss - ncku code for solving einstein s field equations based on the bssn formalism is updated from our previous work @xcite . for the time integration",
    ", we updated from the iterative second - order crank - nicholson method to the fourth - order runge - kutta method .",
    "we also developed our own infrastructure for the implementation of the fixed mesh refinement and its parallelization in addition to using the grace package @xcite .",
    "our new infrastructure also provides a `` moving box '' style mesh refinement .",
    "the box will move to follow the position of the bhs , which are determined by @xcite @xmath4 we follow closely @xcite in the development of the new infrastructure to deal with the interface between two mesh levels . since",
    "three time levels are used for the interpolation in time , we adopt the scheme described in @xcite to prepare the initial data . with grace",
    ", the time step for every mesh level is set to be that the courant factor times the finest spatial resolution .",
    "however , with our new infrastructure , the time step is set by following the recipe in @xcite .",
    "typically , the courant factor is set between @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the results obtained with our infrastructure and with grace s fixed mesh refinement are consistent with each other .",
    "the choice of gauge condition is essential for a long - term stability in the numerical evolution to avoid the encounter of singularity and large spatial coordinate stretch .",
    "the `` 1+log '' condition for the lapse @xcite and the @xmath7-driver condition for the shift @xcite , which are called `` the moving puncture gauge '' together , have been successfully applied to the long - term stable bbh simulations based on the bssn formulation @xcite . in @xcite , we have reviewed and studied the parameters and the additional advection terms for this type of gauge condition used in the community .",
    "therefore , in this work , we adopt @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",
    "the initial gauge conditions are chosen as @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "it has been confirmed in @xcite that this configuration allows stable evolutions .      in this section",
    ", we review the puncture scheme and then describe how the multi - puncture bh initial data is constructed by the multi - domain spectral method extended from the lorene library @xcite . here",
    "we emphasize that our initial data for the three - bh problem is from the numerical calculation solving the full einstein constraint equations .    with the assumption of conformal flatness and maximal slicing in the conformal decomposition of the @xmath13 formalism of general relativity ( see @xcite for instance ) ,",
    "the constraint equations are greatly simplified and also decoupled . and",
    "thus the momentum constraint allows the bowen - york solution @xcite for the conformally trace - free part of the extrinsic curvature of each hole , @xmath14 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{3}{2r^3}n^{(i}\\epsilon^{j)k\\ell}s_k n_\\ell,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the spatial unit vector pointing away from the puncture , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 correspond respectively to the linear momentum and the intrinsic angular momentum of each hole .",
    "@xmath18 can be linearly superposed for multi - hole spacetime with @xmath19 since the momentum constraint equation is linear in this case .",
    "the conformal factor then can be solved from the hamiltonian constraint as @xmath20 to deal with the physical singularity of the bh , one separates out the singular part @xmath21 from the conformal factor @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the mass parameter for each puncture and @xmath24 is the coordinate distance from each puncture .",
    "equation ( [ singular ] ) is the exact multi - hole solution at rest satisfying the flat laplacian equation @xcite .",
    "the desired regular part @xmath25 satisfies the elliptic equation @xmath26 the existence and uniqueness of the solution has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "solving elliptic equations is computationally expensive .",
    "the spectral method is emphatically suitable to be applied to it for its high precision and fast convergence , provided the solution is a smooth function .",
    "the spectral method has been successfully applied to study the relativistic star model @xcite . and",
    "the lorene library has been developed to provide a multi - shell domain framework for this type of problem .",
    "for the puncture initial data , due to the at most @xmath27 property of @xmath28 at the puncture as discussed in @xcite , the direct application of the spectral method would only give a polynomial convergence .",
    "the two - puncture data with spectral method was first extensively studied in @xcite with a series of coordinate transformations which modify and improve the order of smoothness of the solution in the new coordinate .",
    "this scheme has been widely used in the numerical relativity community , though it is not easy to be generalized to a multi - puncture scenario .",
    "the multi - puncture data was studied recently with a multi - grid method in @xcite .    , a spinning bh ( dotted green ) with @xmath29 , and an equal - mass bbh ( solid ) separated by @xmath30 with @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "the vertical axis indicates the relative difference between the solution @xmath28 at @xmath32 and the one at the next higher resolution .",
    "for the single bh cases , the angular resolution @xmath33 which provides sufficient polar angular resolution for this axisymmetric test .",
    "for the bbh case , @xmath34 .",
    "both of them displays exponential convergence at lower resolution and polynomial convergence after the difference has dropped below certain value which is dependent on the choice of domain boundaries . ]    our multi - puncture initial data solver",
    "is motivated by the earlier work @xcite for the excised bbh initial data . in this code",
    "we cover on each bh a spherical multi - shell domain , and split @xmath35 ( the index @xmath36 runs over the number of the bhs ) and the puncture equation ( [ puncture_eq ] ) into @xmath37 note that only one of the extrinsic curvature tensors is split in the equation .",
    "therefore , the source term in the rhs contributes only near each hole .",
    "the use of spherical polar coordinates is adequate for solving the equation near the punctures .",
    "both @xmath38 and @xmath39 are known analytically and would be set once and for all in the source term .",
    "the value of @xmath40 is imposed to be zero at the physical outer boundary ( at infinity ) on the outermost , compactified shell . and @xmath41(@xmath42)@xmath43 is also ensured at the punctures as the inner boundary condition .",
    "these equations for each hole are then solved iteratively with the poisson solver in the lorene library until each successive difference of @xmath44 is as small as possible , typically @xmath45 . in the three - bh scenario ,",
    "the massive hole is fixed and offers a fixed gravitational potential background , therefore there is only two poisson equations that need to be solved in each iteration .",
    "we have also checked the resulting data and found that it is very close to the one from the superposition of the solution of the small binary and the solution of the third massive bh .",
    "this is expected since the massive bh in our study is distant to the binary .",
    "the convergence tests shown in fig .  [ fig : idconvergence ] for a single boosted bh , a spinning bh , and a bbh display a rapid convergence to a high precision .",
    "it is clear that the convergence is exponential with low resolution , but turns to be polynomial with high resolution , as expected in @xcite .",
    "the turning point from an exponential convergence to a polynomial convergence mainly depends on the choice of the domain boundaries , as well as the order of the solution s smoothness . however , it is also known that the polynomial convergence at higher resolution depends only on the singular structure of the solution .",
    "the momentum parameter for the quasi - circular binary is set according to the fitting curve based on the helical killing vector conditions in @xcite . as we note",
    "that , in the puncture scheme , only the metric of 3-geometry was specified , while the initial lapse and shift are chosen as the moving puncture gauge condition described in the beginning of this section .",
    "nevertheless , it is justified in our experience that the choice of initial gauge for the puncture data has little effect on the resulting physical content , at least within our numerical accuracy .      in numerical relativity",
    "the sommerfeld radiation boundary condition is widely used and also a good approximation for no reflection from the boundary at a finite distance . for our bbh simulation with a time - independent gravitational background ,",
    "the field variable set @xmath46 receives the gravitational contribution from the bbh and from the third large bh respectively as @xmath47 where the first term @xmath48 in the rhs includes the dynamical outgoing wave , while the second term @xmath49 in the rhs serves as a fixed gravitational background which are trivially zero except the conformal factor of the third bh , @xmath50 in order to update the variable set @xmath51 at the outer boundary , we first extract @xmath52 at the current time step @xmath53 by subtracting from @xmath54 the @xmath55 which is fixed in the whole evolution .",
    "then , as usual , the sommerfeld boundary condition is applied @xcite to obtain the numerical data of @xmath56 on the outer boundary for the next time step @xmath57 . and",
    "finally we add @xmath55 back to the new @xmath58 to obtain @xmath59 . for the gauge variables",
    ", we use the usual sommerfeld boundary condition for stability .    to justify the appropriateness of the modified boundary condition , we have performed two simulations with different outer boundaries and found their difference on the trajectory and gravitational waveform of the bbh are ignorable , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] ( further details are explained in sec .",
    "[ inor ] ) .",
    "therefore , our boundary condition does not introduce unphysical drift to the bbh and the effect observed in this work is indeed resulted from the third bh .",
    "between the high and medium resolutions .",
    "the red - dashed line represents the difference between the medium and low resolutions with a convergence factor @xmath60 . ]",
    "there is an obvious hierarchical structure in the considered system , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . a small bbh system and a third bh , which is distant and much more massive , form a bigger binary system . from the point view of eccentricity @xmath61 of a binary ,",
    "there are two limits of the possible configurations existing in the universe : a head - on collision ( @xmath62 ) and ( quasi-)circular orbit ( @xmath63 ) . here",
    "we would like to investigate four possible combinations of the limiting cases in order to offer some clues for understanding this kind of astrophysical system .",
    "the considered hierarchical structure comprises four possible cases .",
    "they are ( a ) the head - on - freefall case : a bbh is in the process of a head - on collision while its center of mass ( com ) freefalls toward a third bh ; ( b ) the head - on - orbiting case : a bbh is in the process of a head - on collision while its com circularly orbits a third bh ; ( c ) the inspiral - freefall case : a bbh is in the process of a quasi - circular inspiral while its com freefalls toward a third bh ; ( d ) the inspiral - orbiting case : a bbh is in the process of a quasi - circular inspiral while its com circularly orbits around a third bh .",
    "the numerical results of the four scenarios will be presented in the following subsections .",
    "the total mass of the bbh in these cases is set to be @xmath64 .    .",
    "the red - dashed ( black - solid ) line represents the case with ( without ) the third bh .",
    "the @xmath65 mode of @xmath66 detected at @xmath67 is plotted .",
    "the gravitational potential of the third bh causes mainly shifts in time , decreases in amplitude , and prolongation of the wavelength in the gravitational waveform . ]",
    "we use the similar grid setup as in our previous work @xcite .",
    "there are five levels of grid for the fixed mesh refinement .",
    "the physical boundary is put at @xmath68 .",
    "the domain takes a cubic shape , and the length of the domain in each level shrinks to one half of the length of the preceding level . for the finest level ,",
    "the domain contains two boxes : they are bounded by ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) and ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath72 ) , and are movable with the moving - box technique . before the study on the effect of a third bh , the convergence of our code for an isolated bbh in a head - on collision is tested . the fourth order convergence of @xmath66 is shown in fig .  [ ho_convergence ] with the convergence factor @xmath73 where @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the finest grid widths for the high , median and low resolution , respectively . some minor disagreement for @xmath77",
    "was expected to come from the outer boundary which could give a second - order error .    in the study of the bbh s evolution under a gravitational background , we use the newman - penrose scalar @xmath66 instead of the gravitational strain @xmath78 to represent the gravitational wave .",
    "@xmath66 is widely used in numerical relativity community as a measurement of gravitational waveform .",
    "so it is convenient to use @xmath66 and its spherically harmonic decompositions , instead of @xmath78 , for comparison with previous works .",
    "furthermore , @xmath66 can be linked to @xmath78 straightforwardly as explained in @xcite .",
    "we will consider , in this and the next subsections , the bbhs in head - on collisions while their coms either free - fall toward or circularly orbit around the third massive bh .",
    "the massive bh has the mass @xmath1 and is located at @xmath79 .",
    "we will vary the mass @xmath1 while fix the coordinate distance at @xmath80 , and the ratio @xmath3 will represent the strength of different gravitational potential due to the third massive bh @xcite .    ) , and ( c)proper distance from the center of the small bbh system to the detector , respectively , with respect to the strength of the gravitational potential of the third bh .",
    "( d ) comparison of the proper merging time , which are either measured at the detector(squares ) or as the direct addition(circles ) of ( b ) the ( c ) .",
    "the circles and squares indicate the numerical data .",
    "the slopes of their linear fitting are also given . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we compare the gravitational waves from the head - on collision bbh affected by a third bh and from an isolated binary in our earlier result @xcite .",
    "the bbh in both scenarios has the mass parameters @xmath81 and is initially located at @xmath82 , which are about the isco .",
    "we can see from this figure that the gravitational potential of the third bh causes a time delay , a slight decrease of the amplitude of the @xmath83 mode of @xmath66 and a prolongation of the wavelength in the waveform .",
    "we also observe at the same time the excitation of higher order modes with @xmath84 .",
    "the decrease in the amplitude mainly comes from the gravitational redshift caused by the third bh .",
    "similar to the nonlinear redshift effects of an electromagnetic wave in a medium , the potential of the third bh broadens the spectrum of the gravitational wave instead of simple linear spectral redshift .",
    "the time delay comes from three factors : ( i ) the delayed merger ; ( ii ) the prolonged proper distance from the source to the detector and ( iii ) the change in the coordinate time .",
    "it can be understood that the last one is simply caused by the change of time gauge due to the existence of the third bh , therefore we only discuss the first two factors in detail .    [ cols= \"",
    "> , < \" , ]     the shift of the waveform due to the gravitational background of the third bh are quantitatively shown in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] , in which it indicates the transition from the time - delay to time - advance as the initial separation of bbh increases .",
    "similar to the previous case , the possible explanation for the change in the time difference of the inspiral - to - merger process of a bbh under the influence of a third large bh compared with the one of an isolated bbh , arises from the competition between the eccentricity effect and the gravitational redshift effect .",
    "compared with the previous ( inspiraling - freefall ) case in which the ( @xmath85 ) mode of @xmath66 is dominant among the higher modes , the ( @xmath86 ) modes of @xmath66 is dominant in the current case , as shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] .",
    "the orbiting of the bbh along the @xmath87-@xmath88 plane accounts for this effect .",
    "in addition , the amplitude of the ( @xmath86 ) mode of re(@xmath66 ) increases nonlinearly .",
    "motivated by the fact that most bbh systems are located in the gravitational potential of a super - massive bh hosted in the center of a galaxy , we investigate the effect of the potential on the dynamics of a bbh system . instead of the heavily numerical calculation of the evolution of the three - bh problem with a fully relativistic treatment",
    ", we use a perturbational scheme to investigate the effect of the gravitational potential from a third large bh on the evolution of a bbh , especially on the waveform of gravitational radiation . in our perturbation method",
    ", we ignore the back - reaction of the bbh system on the third large bh , regarding the third bh as a background for the bbh system .",
    "the scenarios we consider include the head - on collision and the inspiral - to - merger process of a bbh in the cases of the bbh system freefalling towards , or circularly orbiting around the third large bh , which are considered as the two limits in all possible configurations .",
    "the effect of the gravitational potential from a third bh on a bbh system in our study includes : ( 1 ) the gravitational redshift effect , including the prolongation of proper distance , the prolongation of the wavelength , the decrease of the waveform amplitude ; ( 2 ) the increase in the eccentricity which is from the tidal effect of the third large bh and expedites the merger of a bbh system ; ( 3 ) delaying or advancing the merging process of the bbh , which depends on the competition between the gravitational redshift effect and the eccentricity effect ; ( 4 ) inducing the higher - order modes in the gravitational waveform .",
    "the orientation of the bbh system hardly affects the above results .",
    "it is interesting that ( 4 ) supports the conjecture proposed in @xcite in the full gr regime .",
    "this might provide valuable information for gravitational wave astronomy to distinguish whether the detected bbh system is isolated or located in the potential of a super - massive bh .    in this work , for the @xmath89 modes , all the quantities are linearly dependent on the gravitational potential @xmath3 , which validates the usage of the perturbation method . in most realistic cases ,",
    "the gravitational potential is much weaker than the cases considered in this work .",
    "therefore the perturbation method is expected to be applicable to most realistic cases .",
    "the third bh in our case introduces a non - axisymmetric background feature , which makes the issue of gravitational wave extraction even more complicated .",
    "however , considering the detector located at the weak field region and finitely separated from both the merging binary and the massive bh , we adopt the usual approach to extract the information of gravitational radiation via the newman - penrose scalar @xmath66 .",
    "a possible extension of the work would be a detailed study on the more rigorous way to extract the radiation under a background and the dependence of the modification on the relative position of the binary , detector and the background source .",
    "we have considered the evolution of an equal - mass bbh under the influence of a third large bh .",
    "the study can be generalized to an unequal - mass bbh system .",
    "the major effects from the third large bh on a bbh are shown qualitatively in this study .",
    "the results indicate that these phenomena could introduce complications or even be misleading in the identification of the source of gravitational wave without further study to distinguish the signatures of a bbh in a background gravitational potential from the ones of an isolated bbh .",

    "the gravitational background effect depends in the perturbative regime only on the ratio @xmath3 .",

    "thus our result can be applied straightforwardly to those usual cases .",
    "however , it is quite possible for the existence of bbh systems near the center of a galaxy where @xmath3 would be larger than in the usual astrophysical cases by several orders of magnitude",
    ". our study should be also applicable to such cases as long as the ratio @xmath3 s are comparable .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3]d , there is a gap between the measured proper time and the direct sum of the estimated proper merging time and the proper propagation time .",
    "the estimated proper merging time is defined here as the time for the nearest proper distance between two bh s apparent horizons becoming zero .",
    "the measured proper time is for the highest peak of the gravitational wave to arrive at the detector .",
    "the highest peak of gravitational wave should happen when the two bhs _ really _ merge , and thus later than the estimated proper merging time .",
    "this explains the gap .",
    "the separation of the bbh can not increase indefinitely under the assumption in this work .",
    "when the separation is comparable with @xmath2 , the whole configuration turns to a three - body problem to which the perturbational method in this work can not apply ."

    "<S> binary black hole ( bbh ) systems are usually located in the gravitational potential well formed by a massive black hole ( bh ) , which is mostly located in the center of a galaxy . in most existing studies , </S>",
    "<S> the bbh systems are treated as isolated systems , while the effect of the background is ignored . </S>",
    "<S> the validity of the approximation is based on the belief that the background gravitational field from other sources is extremely weak compared with the strong gravitational field produced by the bbh itself during the evolution , and can be neglected in gravitational wave detection . however , it is still interesting to check how valid this approximation is . in this work , instead of simulating the three - bh problem with a fully relativistic treatment , </S>",
    "<S> we use a perturbational scheme to investigate the effect of the background gravitational potential on the evolution of a bbh , especially on the waveform of its gravitational radiation . </S>",
    "<S> four scenarios are considered including the head - on collision and the inspiral - to - merger process of a bbh which is either freefalling towards or circularly orbiting around a third large bh . </S>",
    "<S> the head - on collision and the circular inspiral are two limits of all possible configurations . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of the background gravitational potential changes the arrival time of the gravitational wavefront of a bbh , prolongs the wavelength , and increases the gravitational radiation energy . and </S>",
    "<S> most interestingly , the background gravitational potential induces the higher - order modes of the gravitational wave of a bbh . </S>",
    "<S> these interesting phenomena can be explained by the gravitational redshift effect and the change of eccentricity of a bbh s orbit from the background gravitational potential . without further studies , </S>",
    "<S> these phenomena could introduce complications or even mislead people in the identification of the source of gravitational wave and in distinguishing the signatures of an isolated bbh from a bbh in a background gravitational potential . </S>"
