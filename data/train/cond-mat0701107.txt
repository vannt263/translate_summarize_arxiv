    "a transport regime where a sub - micron lateral structure is strongly coupled to electron reservoirs ( leads ) is usually referred to as an open onealhassid , datta .",
    "this transport regime can be realized in quantum wires , dot and antidot structures typically fabricated using a split - gate or related techniques .",
    "such the techniques allow one to obtain devices with desired and variable geometry and parameters such as an electron density and lead openings .",
    "the quantum dot operates in an open regime when the gate voltage sets up two quantum point contacts ( qpcs ) at the entrance and exit of the dot such that they transmit one or more channels ( i.e. the conductance of an individual qpc , @xmath0 ) . in this regime electrons",
    "can freely enter and exit the dot , such that the electron number inside the dot is not integer and the chemical potential throughout the whole device in the linear responce regime is constant .",
    "[ opposite regime emerges when the point contacts are nearly pinched off and is referred to as a coulomb blockade@xcite . in this case",
    "the electron number in the dot is quantized and the chemical potential inside the dot is different from that one in the leads ] . during the last decade",
    "the open quantum dots have received a significant attention providing many important insights into areas such as quantum interference , chaos , decoherence , localization and many others@xcite .",
    "earlier transport experiments have been mainly devoted to the dots with hundreds or even thousands electrons .",
    "only recently it has become possible to reduce occupancy down to only a few or even one electron@xcite .",
    "electron - electron interaction is known to have great impact on transport in quantum dots with such pronounced examples as coulomb blockade@xcite or kondo effect@xcite . a description of the quantum transport in quantum dots",
    "is often based on model hamiltonians containing phenomenological parameters such as coupling strengths or charging constants@xcite . in many cases",
    "it is not always straightforward to relate quantitatively the above parameters to the physical processes they represent in the real system and sometimes it is not even obvious whether a model description is sufficient to capture the essential physics . at the same time , it is now becomes well recognized that a detailed understanding and interpretation of the experiment might require a quantitative microscopical modelling of the system at hand free from phenomenological parameters and not relying on model hamiltonians which validity is poorly controlled .",
    "the importance of such the modelling can be illustrated by examples including the quantitative description of the compressible / incompressible strips in magnetic field at the edges of the two - dimensional electron gas@xcite or explanation of the hund rule observed in few - electron quantum dotsstephanie , just to name a few .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is twofold .",
    "first , we develop an approach aimed on full quantum mechanical many - body transport calculations in open systems that starts from the lithographical layout of the device and does not include phenomenological parameters such as coupling strengths , charging constants etc",
    ". the whole device , including semi - infinitive leads , is treated on the same footing ( i.e. the electron - electron interaction is accounted for both in the leads as well as in the dot region ) . using the recursive green s function technique we self - consistently compute the scattering solutions of the two - dimensional schrdinger equation in magnetic fieldzozoulenko_1996 .",
    "following the parametrization for the exchange and correlation energy functionals of tanatar and ceperley@xcite the electron - electron interaction is incorporated within the density functional theory ( dft ) in the local density approximation@xcite .",
    "the validity of the dft approximation is supported by the excellent agreement with the exact diagonalization and variational monte carlo calculations performed for few - electron systems@xcite , as well as by the good quantitative correspondence between the experiment and the dft calculations for the magnetoconductance of quantum wires@xcite .",
    "our approach thus accounts for the quantum mechanics nature of the scattering states and the resonant levels as well as for the exchange and correlation beyond the hartree approximation .",
    "at the same time , it accurately describes the global electrostatic and the screening in the dots as well as in the leads .",
    "the second aim of the present paper is to revise the role of the electron - electron interaction in transport properties of open quantum dots .",
    "it is widely believed that in open transport regime ( as opposed to the coulomb blockade or kondo regime ) , the electron - electron interaction plays only a minor role .",
    "the main finding of the present paper is the effect of pinning of the resonant levels to the fermi energy due to the enhanced screening .",
    "our results represent a significant departure from a conventional picture adopted in most model hamiltonians as well as in more sophisticated numerical calculations where a variation of external parameters ( such as a gate voltage , magnetic field , etc . )",
    "causes the successive dot states to sweep past the fermi level in a linear fashion .",
    "we instead demonstrate highly nonlinear behavior of the resonant levels in the vicinity of the fermi energy .",
    "one of the observable consequence of this effect is smearing of the conductance fluctuations .",
    "we also show that the resonant level pinning becomes especially pronounced in magnetic field .",
    "thus , accounting for this effect might be important for the interpretation of the magnetotransport experiment in open structures , including e.g. recent studies of the electronic mach - zehnder interferometer@xcite and the laughlin quasiparticle interferometer@xcite , structures designed to test the realization of the topological quantum computing@xcite , antidot structures@xcite and others .",
    "it should be also noted that the quantum dot structures demonstrating kondo effect fall into the semi - open transport regime such that accounting for effect of the nonlinear screening leading to the resonant level pinning might be essential for the interpretation of the experiments in this regime as well .",

    "f : fewelectron.the only difference is the shift along @xmath74-axis which is simply related to the fact that the hartree potential for the case of the closed system , in contrast to the open one , does not include a contribution from the semi - infinite leads .",
    "figure [ f : closed](d ) reveals that the pinning of resonant energy levels to the fermi energy is present in the closed system - approximation as well .",
    "we thus conclude that this approximation might be used for the modelling of the transport properties and the resonant energy level structure of the corresponding open system .",
    "we however should note that with the present approximation we could not satisfy the convergence criterium ( [ convergence ] ) that we routinely use for the calculation of the conductance in the open systems as described in sec .",
    "we have developed an approach for full quantum mechanical many - body magnetotransport calculations in open systems that starts from the lithographical layout of the device and does not include phenomenological parameters like coupling strengths , charging constants etc .",
    "the whole device , including semi - infinitive leads , is treated on the same footing ( i.e. the electron - electron interaction is accounted for in both the leads as well as in the dot region ) .",
    "the many - body effects are included within the dft and the hartree approximations .",
    "the developed method was applied to calculate the conductance through an open quantum dot .",
    "the main finding of the present paper is the effect of pinning of the resonant levels to the fermi energy due to the enhanced screening .",
    "our results represent a significant departure from a conventional picture where a variation of external parameters ( such as a gate voltage , magnetic field , etc . )",
    "causes the successive dot states to sweep past the fermi level in a linear fashion .",
    "we instead demonstrate highly nonlinear behavior of the resonant levels in the vicinity of the fermi energy .",
    "we show that the pinning effect is absent in a one - electron ( thomas - fermy ) approximation because in this case the self - consistent potential does not account for the resonant structure of the dos in the dot .",
    "the pinning of the resonant levels in open quantum dots leads to the broadening of the conduction oscillations in comparison to the one electron picture .",
    "it remains to be seen whether accounting for this effect might shed new light on the interpretation of the conductance oscillation statistics in open quantum dots .",
    "the pinning of the resonant levels becomes much more pronounced in the presence of the perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "this can be attributed to the enhanced screening efficiency because of the increased localization of the wave function .",
    "the strong pinning of the resonant energy levels in the presence of magnetic field can have a profound effect on transport properties of various devices operating in the edge state transport regime including mach - zender@xcite and laughlin@xcite interferometers as well as antidot devices@xcite .",
    "we should stress that the pinning effect predicted in this paper is not specific to the considered material system ( gaas / algaas heterostructure ) and is expected to hold in any two - dimensional system in open transport regime ( e.g. si inversion layer structures , etc . ) .",
    "finally , in the present paper we critically examined an approximation used in modelling of quantum mechanical transport in quantum dots and related systems when an inherently open system is replaces by a corresponding large , but closed one .",
    "in the present study we have limited ourselves to the case of spinless electrons .",
