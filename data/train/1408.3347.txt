    "let @xmath1 be a connected reductive complex algebraic group .",
    "a subgroup @xmath2 of @xmath1 is _ spherical _ if a borel subgroup of @xmath1 has a dense orbit on @xmath3 ; in this case @xmath3 is called a _",
    "spherical _ homogeneous space . over the last 30 years",
    "the theory of spherical subgroups has been widely developed , as has the general theory of _ spherical varieties _ , i.e.  normal @xmath1-varieties where a borel subgroup of @xmath1 has a dense orbit .",
    "the present paper introduces a new research project , aimed at bringing this theory to the infinite - dimensional setting of kac - moody groups .",
    "the first task is to choose a generalization of the definition of spherical subgroups , which in the classical case can be given in several different ways .",
    "here we proceed as follows : we say that a subgroup @xmath4 of a kac - moody group @xmath5 is _ spherical of finite type _ if is contained in a parabolic subgroup @xmath6 of negative sign such that @xmath7 has a finite - dimensional levi subgroup @xmath0 and @xmath8 is a ( finite - dimensional ) spherical variety under the action of @xmath0 ( see sections  [ s : km ] and [ s : kmsph ] and definition  [ def : spherical ] for details ) .",
    "these assumptions are particularly effective because the intermediate subgroup @xmath7 provides a direct connection with the standard theory of spherical varieties .",
    "our point of view is that the `` symmetries '' of @xmath9 given by the action of @xmath5 are essentially already encoded in the finite - dimensional variety @xmath8 viewed as a spherical @xmath0-variety equipped with the additional automorphisms given by the unipotent radical of @xmath7 .",
    "our main results are the definition of a combinatorial object called the _ homogeneous spherical datum _ of @xmath9 ( see definition  [ def : hsd ] ) , generalizing the one given in @xcite in the finite - dimensional setting , and the proof that this datum satisfies the same combinatorial properties as in the finite - dimensional case ( see theorem  [ thm : consistent ] ) .",
    "we recall that the classification of finite - dimensional spherical homogeneous spaces , according to the _ luna conjecture _ , is established in terms of such objects , and that a proof of this conjecture has been proposed as the culmination of the work of several authors ( see @xcite , see also @xcite for a different approach ) .",
    "we also show that the homogeneous spherical datum is independent of the choice of @xmath7 , and invariant under conjugation of @xmath4 in @xmath5 ( see theorems  [ thm : indep ] and [ thm : conjugation ] ) .",
    "these crucial properties are not as obvious as in the classical theory .",
    "we point out that a more encompassing study of the `` big '' homogeneous space @xmath9 is possible , but goes beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "for example , using the ind - variety structure of @xmath10 it is possible to give a natural structure of ind - variety to @xmath9 .",
    "here we do not pursue this line , nor the relationship between our definition of spherical subgroups of finite type and other possible generalizations .",
    "this will be the subject of a forthcoming paper .",
    "this research project is motivated by various recent developments in the literature on infinite - dimensional groups .",
    "symmetric subgroups of affine kac - moody groups have been classified ( see e.g.  @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) , the geometry of the corresponding symmetric spaces and of certain compactifications are a current research topic ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "research on the space of loops on a spherical variety has led to a link between spherical varieties and langlands duality ( see @xcite ) . on this subject",
    "see also @xcite : although still mostly conjectural , the combinatorics of spherical varieties provide a way to analyze periods of automorphic forms and related problems in local harmonic analysis .",
    "moreover , the techniques used for solving delzant s conjecture on multiplicity free hamiltonian manifolds ( see @xcite ) , where affine smooth spherical varieties have a central role , can be applied also to multiplicity free hamiltonian actions of loop groups ( a paper by friedrich knop on this subject is in preparation ) .",
    "in addition , our results on @xmath8 intersect the study of the automorphism groups of spherical varieties , which is an ongoing research area ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    in the first part of the paper , sections  [ s : invariantsfinite][s : examplesfinite ] , we develop the basic tools to study @xmath8 . here",
    "we work in even greater generality : we start with a connected linear algebraic group @xmath11 with levi subgroup @xmath0 , and we consider a homogeneous space @xmath12 with the only assumption that it is a spherical @xmath0-variety . in this generality",
    "we define some invariants associated with the action of @xmath11 on @xmath12 , the most relevant being its _ spherical roots _ ( see definition  [ def : sphroots ] ) , and we establish relationships between the combinatorics of these objects and the geometry of @xmath11-equivariant compactifications of @xmath12 .    in the second part of the paper , kac - moody groups enter into the picture : we start now with @xmath13 as above , and identify @xmath8 with a homogeneous space @xmath12 where @xmath11 is a finite - dimensional quotient of @xmath7 .",
    "we discuss the invariants of @xmath12 in this case and derive for them further combinatorial properties essentially from the structure of the roots of @xmath7 and the weyl group of @xmath5 . in section  [ s : hsd ] we collect the invariants we have defined and introduce the homogeneous spherical datum of @xmath9 , showing that it satisfies the same axioms luna had introduced in @xcite in the finite - dimensional case . in sections",
    "[ s : conjugation ] we prove invariance of the homogeneous spherical datum under conjugation of @xmath4 in @xmath5 , in section  [ s : conj ] we discuss possible further developments , and finally section  [ s : examples ] is devoted to some examples .",
    "i am very grateful to friedrich knop for his help and support , for many suggestions and for sharing his ideas on the subject of this paper and on possible further developments .",
    "i also thank michel brion , bart van steirteghem and domingo luna for stimulating discussions and suggestions .",
