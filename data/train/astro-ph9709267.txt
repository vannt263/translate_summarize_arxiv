    "in addition to about 15 radio pulsars associated with supernova remnants ( gaensler & johnston 1995 ) , several _ radio silent _ isolated neutron star ( ns ) candidates within snrs have been observed with the x - ray observatories _ heao _ a , _ einstein _ , _ exosat _ , , and ( see caraveo , bignami & trmper 1996 for a review ) .",
    "these objects have not been detected outside the x - ray range , and their x - spectra resemble blackbody ( bb ) spectra with temperatures of a few million kelvins .",
    "if they are indeed thermally emitting nss , the analysis of their radiation provides an opportunity to study thermal evolution of nss of ages @xmath11  yr , which is important for elucidating the properties of the superdence matter in ns interiors .",
    "one of the most convincing examples of such objects is the point - like source  within the barrel - shaped radio , x - ray , and optical snr pks 120952 ( also known as g269.5 + 10.0 ) . from the analysis of radio and optical observations of this snr , roger et al .",

    "the _ einstein _",
    "high resolution imager ( hri ) observations showed a lack of diffuse x - ray emission around   ( later confirmed by the  hri observations ) , which greatly simplifies the analysis of the point source radiation . from the analysis of _ exosat _ observations ,",

    "the authors noticed that this temperature is too high to be explained in the framework of a cooling ns with age of pks 120952 ( @xmath28 yr ) .",
    "the hydrogen column inferred from the bb fit , @xmath29 , is 34 times lower than the estimate given by kellett et al .",

    "they also set a deep limit of @xmath31 for an optical counterpart in the _ einstein _ hri error circle , that supports the hypothesis that   is indeed an isolated ns .",

    "( 1997 ; hereafter val97 ) have recently analysed observations of .",
    "they found that each of the three spectra obtained with the  detectors can be fitted by a bb spectrum consistent with that obtained from the analysis of the  data .",
    "the hydrogen column is poorly restricted in the  spectral fits due to low detector sensitivities at photon energies below 0.5  kev . using a fit with a raymond - smith model at fixed cosmic abundances to the  data on the snr shell , val97 estimated the remnant temperature @xmath32  k and the foreground column density @xmath33 .",
    "they attributed the difference in @xmath34 between the ns and snr fits to either separate lines of sight or the large column density that the shell x - rays can encounter in the snr postshocked gas .",
    "based on the results of the blackbody analysis , both mbc96 and val97 concluded that  is an isolated ns with hot spots on its surface , aligned with the magnetic poles .",
    "val97 suggested that the spots are heated either by dissipative heating in the ns interior or by the bombardment of polar caps by relativistic particles from the ns magnetosphere if  is an active pulsar .",
    "however , the former hypothesis can hardly explain the small sizes of the hot spots , even with allowance for large anisotropy of thermal conductivity of the magnetized ns crust .",
    "the latter heating mechanism is also in doubt because of the absence of radio and @xmath35-ray emission from .",
    "both the  and  data did not reveal pulsations , which may not be consistent with the presence of the hot spots unless the magnetic and rotation axes are coaligned .",
    "although it looks very plausible that  is a thermally emitting isolated ns , the bb interpretation adopted by previous authors leaves several controvertible points . on the other hand , thermal radiation emitted by ns atmospheres may significantly differ from the bb radiation .",
    "therefore , to resolve the inconsistencies following from the simplified bb interpretation , it is natural to employ more realistic models of ns radiation . here",
    "we present a _ combined _ analysis of the  and  data based on _ ns atmosphere models _",
    "( pavlov et al .",
    "1995 , and references therein ) .",
    "these models have been applied successfully to the interpretation of the soft x - ray radiation from , e.g. , the vela pulsar ( page , shibanov & zavlin 1996 ) and the brightest millisecond pulsar j04374715 ( zavlin & pavlov 1997 ; pavlov & zavlin 1997 ) .",
    "these examples show that fitting the soft x - ray pulsar spectra with hydrogen or helium atmosphere models always results in lower effective temperatures and greater emitting areas ( or smaller distances ) than those obtained from the bb fits .",
    "we show in  2 that , indeed , the model atmosphere fits of the x - ray radiation from   yield an ns surface temperature compatible with ns cooling models , and they do not require hot spots on the ns surface .",
    "moreover , the hydrogen column density inferred from this interpretation is in excellent agreement with that obtained from our fits of the snr x - ray radiation as well as with independent estimates of @xmath34 for stars in the vicinity of  (  3 ) .",
    "these results warrant application of the same approach to other similar objects and enable one to obtain reliable estimates of surface temperatures of nss of different ages .",
    "we used archival  and   data on   ( see mbc96 and val97 for a detailed description ) . four  position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) pointings ( obtained in 1993 july , with exposure times @xmath36  ks each",
    " see table 2 in mbc96 ) were centered at different positions ( off - axis angles between @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) .",
    "we checked that the spectra of   extracted from each of the four data sets and properly corrected for the pspc response are consistent with each other .",
    "for the combined analysis with the  data we chose the  pspc observation with the minimum off - axis angle @xmath37 ( exposure time @xmath39  ks ) .",
    "we extracted a raw spectrum from a region with a radius @xmath40 centered on the source .",
    "the ( off - axis ) source count rate is @xmath41  s@xmath42 .",
    "we binned this spectrum into 24 spectral bins in the 0.12.4  kev energy range for further analysis .",
    "the  hri counts for each of the three on - axis pointings ( obtained in 1992 august and 1994 july ; total exposure time @xmath43  ks ) were selected from the circles of @xmath44 .",
    "the corresponding source count rate is @xmath45  s@xmath42 , in agreement with mbc96 .",
    "the  data were obtained in 1994 july , with two solid state imaging spectrometers , sis0 and sis1 , in the bright mode , and two gas scintillation imaging spectrometers , gis2 and gis3 , in the pulse - height mode .",
    "the sis1 image of   is too close to the edge of the ccd chip for a reliable spectral analysis .",
    "the sis0 source counts collected in @xmath46  ks ( with high and medium bit rates ) were extracted from the circle of @xmath47 , the total source count rate is @xmath48  s@xmath42 .",
    "the sis0 spectrum was binned into 38 spectral bins in the @xmath49  kev range .",
    "the gis2 and gis3 counts were extracted from circles of @xmath50 ( exposure @xmath51  ks for the high plus medium bit rates ) .",
    "the source count rates are @xmath52 ( gis2 ) and @xmath53  s@xmath42 ( gis3 ) .",
    "the spectra were binned into 40 and 45 spectral bins in the @xmath54  kev range for gis2 and gis3 , respectively .",
    "the total source count rates for all the three  instruments are somewhat lower than those reported by val97 , perhaps because of different screening criteria we applied .    as a first step of our data analysis , we fitted the count rate spectra _",
    "simultaneously for the four instruments _ ,  pspc and  sis0 , gis2 , and gis3 , with the traditional power - law and bb models .",
    "figure  1 shows the results of these fittings .",
    "the power - law fit yields a photon index @xmath55 and a hydrogen column density , @xmath56 ( minimum @xmath57 , @xmath58 ; the uncertainties hereafter are at a 90% confidence level ) .",
    "these values of @xmath35 and @xmath34 are better constrained than those obtained by mbc96 from the pspc data alone , @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( minimum @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) .",
    "the photon index is unusually large in comparison with typical values , @xmath63 , observed from , e.g. , x - ray emitting radio pulsars ( becker & trmper 1997 ) , and the hydrogen column density too much exceeds the values obtained by independent measurements ( see below ) .",
    "these discrepancies , together with the too high minimum @xmath64 , imply that the power - law interpretation is inadequate .    the bb temperature ( as measured by a distant observer ) , @xmath65  k , the apparent radius of the emitting area , @xmath66  km , and the bolometric luminosity , @xmath67  erg  s@xmath42 , obtained from the combined fitting ( fig .  1 )",
    "are very close to the values from the separate fits of the  and  data by mbc96 and val97 .",
    "the hydrogen column density in the combined fitting , @xmath68 , is compatible with ( albeit slightly lower than ) the value of @xmath69 inferred from the separate  pspc spectrum .",
    "although the quality of the bb fit is better than of the power law fit , the @xmath34 values look surprisingly low in comparison with @xmath70  @xmath8 obtained from independent estimates ( see introduction )",
    ".    since thermal ns spectra , as well as spectra of ordinary stars , can not exactly coincide with the bb spectra because of the effects of radiative transfer in the emitting layers , it is natural to compare them with more realistic model spectra of ns atmospheres ( e.g. , pavlov et al .",
    "strongest deviations from the bb spectrum are expected if the ns surface is covered with a hydrogen atmosphere .",
    "hydrogen may appear at the ns surface as a result of , e.g. , accretion of interstellar matter or post - supernova accretion of a fraction of the ejected envelope .",
    "due to the huge surface gravity ( typical gravitational acceleration @xmath71  cm  s@xmath72 ) , heavier chemical elements sink down in deeper layers and do not affect properties of emitted radiation , whereas hydrogen remains at the surface .",
    "the shape of the spectrum emitted by an atmosphere depends on the strength @xmath73 of the ns surface magnetic field .",
    "the lack of pulsations does not allow one to estimate @xmath73 using period and its derivative , as is usually done for pulsars .",
    "the absence of statistically reliable features in the observed spectra , which could be associated with an electron cyclotron line at @xmath74  kev , prevents one to make a direct estimation of @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , one has to try the atmosphere models with both low ( @xmath75  g ) and high magnetic fields .",
    "( in the former case , the field does not affect properties of emergent radiation [ zavlin , pavlov & shibanov 1996 ] , so that we can merely put @xmath76 ) .",
    "in the case of strong nonuniform field ( @xmath77  g ) , the ns should have a nonuniform temperature distribution along its surface because of the high anisotropic thermal conductivity in the ns crust ( e.g. , shibanov & yakovlev 1996 ) .",
    "however , since we have no information about the field geometry , we assume that the magnetic field has the same strength and is directed radially everywhere at the surface , and the effective temperature is uniform .",
    "this assumption reduces the number of fitting parameters and can be considered as a reasonable first approximation for investigating the atmosphere effects .",
    "figure  2 shows results of fitting of the combined  and  data with hydrogen atmosphere models for three fixed values of the magnetic field . in these fits",
    "we assume canonical values for the ns mass and radius , @xmath78 and @xmath79  km , and consider the distance as a fitting parameter . the models with @xmath76 ( left panels ) and @xmath80  g ( right panels ) result in close values of the distance , effective temperature at the ns surface and bolometric luminosity , @xmath81  kpc , @xmath82  k , @xmath83  erg  s@xmath42 , and @xmath84  kpc , @xmath85  k , @xmath86  erg  s@xmath42 , for @xmath76 and @xmath80  g , respectively . since the nonmagnetic spectra are softer at lower energies , the hydrogen column density at @xmath76 , @xmath87 , is lower than for the strong magnetic field , @xmath88 .",
    "we checked that folding the models within the 90% confidence region with the  hri response yields count rates compatible with those observed .",
    "when the field strength varies in the range @xmath89  g , the fitting parameters remain approximately the same because the model spectra are almost insensitive to the @xmath73 value in the corresponding domain of energies and effective temperatures .",
    "when @xmath73 exceeds @xmath90  g , the proton cyclotron line centered at @xmath91  kev ( cf .",
    "bezchastnov et al .  1996 ) enters the sis energy range , which makes the fits statistically unacceptable .",
    "( this line moves above @xmath92  kev , a maximum energy where the ns flux is still above the background , at superstrong magnetic fields , @xmath93 , for which the models we used here are not directly applicable . )",
    "when @xmath73 falls below @xmath94  g , the low - energy wing of the electron cyclotron line gets into the  range , and the model spectra become softer at @xmath95  kev . as a result ,",
    "the confidence contours in the @xmath34@xmath96 and @xmath34@xmath97 planes move to greater @xmath96 and @xmath97 , and lower @xmath34 , towards the bb contours .",
    "an example is shown in the middle panels of fig .  2 for @xmath98  g , for which the best - fit distance is about 50% larger than at @xmath99  g. when the field is lower than @xmath100  g , but greater than @xmath101  g , the atmosphere model fits become statistically unacceptable because the core of the electron cyclotron line gets into the /  range .",
    "the atmosphere models depend not only on @xmath73 , but also on the ns mass and radius which determine the gravitational acceleration ( one of our model parameters ) and the gravitational redshift factor @xmath102 , where @xmath103 , @xmath104 . to illustrate this effect , we present in fig .",
    "3 the best - fit parameters at @xmath99  g in a wide range of @xmath105 and @xmath106 allowed by equations of state of the ns matter .",
    "although the effective temperature at the ns surface , @xmath97 , varies by about @xmath107 in the allowed @xmath105-@xmath106 domain , the apparent effective temperature ( as measured by a distant observer ) , @xmath108 , remains almost constant , @xmath109  k , because the redshift is compensated by the change of the unredshifted ns spectrum ( it softens in the wien tail with increasing @xmath106 and decreasing @xmath105 at given @xmath97 ) .",
    "owing to the approximate constancy of @xmath110 , the apparent and `` true '' bolometric luminosities depend on @xmath105 and @xmath106 as @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "the latter dependence explains the non - monotonous behaviour of @xmath113 at higher @xmath106 .",
    "the best - fit @xmath96 and @xmath34 are almost independent of @xmath106 at higher @xmath105 , when @xmath114 is close to 1 . at lower @xmath105",
    "the variations are stronger , albeit within the statistical uncertainties of these parameters ( cf .",
    "the distance inferred at assumed @xmath105 and @xmath106 can be approximately described , in the allowed mass  radius domain , by a linear equation : @xmath115 ( in kpc ) ; it grows with @xmath105 faster than for the bb interpretation .",
    "notice that if @xmath96 is determined more accurately in future observations of the snr and its central source , this equation would delimit a band in the @xmath106@xmath105 plane constraining equation of state of the ns matter .",
    "since the hydrogen atmosphere fits yield @xmath34 greater than the bb fit by a factor of 35 , it is important to estimate this parameter independently . for this purpose , we fitted the snr emission with various models for thermal plasma radiation .",
    "we extracted the snr spectrum from a bright region of the  pspc image of the remnant shell within the @xmath116 circle centered at @xmath117 , @xmath118 .",
    "three models available with the xspec package , vraymond , vmeka , and vmekal ( raymond  smith , mewe  gronenschild  kaastra , and mewe  kaastra  liedahl models with variable abundances ) give satisfactory fits ( @xmath119 ) with the column density to the snr in the range of @xmath120  @xmath8 , consistent with the hydrogen atmosphere fits of , but certainly in excess of the bb fits .",
    "the inferred plasma temperature is @xmath121  k. these results were obtained with a moderate excess of abundances of al and si whose emission lines are prominent in the sis spectra of the snr shell .",
    "abundances of other elements are close to standard values .",
    "the snr parameters inferred from our fittings are consistent with those obtained by kellett et al .",
    "( 1987 ) from the _ exosat _ data .",
    "the lower hydrogen density , @xmath122 , obtained by val97 , is likely associated with fixed cosmic abundances adopted , that resulted in lower statistical quality of their fits ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "we have shown that the x - ray spectra of the isolated ns   in the center of the snr pks 120952 observed with the  pspc and hri and  sis0 , gis2 and gis3 can be interpreted as _ thermal radiation from the",
    "hydrogen - covered , uniformly heated surface of the ns_. the proposed interpretation resolves all the inconsistencies which follow from the bb interpretation of radiation of this object .    _ first _ , the range of distances , @xmath124  kpc , inferred for the standard ns mass @xmath78 and radius @xmath79  km , is within the ( conservative ) limits , @xmath13  kpc , obtained from radio observations of the snr .",
    "this range shifts to lower distances with decreasing @xmath105 and @xmath106 : e.g. , @xmath125  kpc for @xmath126 , @xmath127  km .",
    "thus , the assumption about hot spots on the ns surface , which is difficult to reconcile with the lack of pulsar activity in , is superfluous in our model .    _",
    "second _ , the effective temperature @xmath128  k ( @xmath129  k ) , obtained from the fittings with our hydrogen atmosphere models , matches well to a number of the ns cooling models ( see fig .  4 and discussion below ) . on the contrary , it is difficult to reconcile the results of the bb interpretation with models of the ns cooling .",
    "_ third _ , the inferred hydrogen column density towards the , @xmath130 and @xmath131 for high and low surface magnetic fields , respectively , agrees fairly well with @xmath132 obtained from fitting the spectra of the snr shell .",
    "these estimates are consistent with the @xmath34 values obtained by kellett et al .",
    "( 1987 ) from the _ exosat _ observations of pks 120952 .",
    "moreover , measurements of @xmath34 in uv observations of several stars in the vicinity of  ( @xmath133 , @xmath134 ) yield the hydrogen columns in virtually the same range ( fruscione et al .  1994 ) : @xmath135 for hd112244 ( @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138  kps ) , @xmath139 for hd115842 ( @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142  kps ) and hd111822 ( @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145  kps ) . on the contrary ,",
    "the bb fit gives @xmath146 , clearly incompatible with all the other independent estimates .",
    "the fact that  shows no pulsar activity can be explained , in addition to the trivial explanation of unfavorable orientation of its magnetic and rotational axes , by slow rotation or / and low magnetic field of the ns , so that it falls below the `` death line '' on the @xmath147@xmath148 diagram , @xmath149  s@xmath150 .",
    "for the simplest model of the magnetic dipole radiator , the pulsar period increases with time @xmath151 as @xmath152 , where @xmath153  s , @xmath154  g  @xmath155 is the moment of inertia of the ns and @xmath156 .",
    "the condition that the ns is below the death line can be written as @xmath157  s@xmath150 , or @xmath158",
    "s. hence , if @xmath73 is in the range of strong magnetic fields allowed by our fitting , @xmath159 , we may expect that the ns rotates slowly , @xmath160",
    "s. if faster pulsations are discovered in future x - ray observations of , it would indicate that @xmath73 is in the other range compatible with our fits : @xmath5  g. it is worth noting that if the ns was born as a pulsar at an appreciable distance from the death line , only an enormous magnetic field , @xmath161  g at standard ns parameters , could decelerate its rotation so that the pulsar would `` die '' at the relatively young age , @xmath162  yr .",
    "hence , discovery of slow pulsations would mean that the ns was born slowly rotating unless its magnetic field is superstrong .    since we have estimated the effective temperature of the ns , it is interesting to compare it with what is predicted by various cooling models .",
    "figure 4 shows examples of ns cooling curves from van riper , link & epstein ( 1995 ) for three equations of state ( eos ) , stiff ( pandharipande  smith [ ps ] ) , intermediate ( friedman  pandharipande [ fp ] ) and soft ( baym  pethick  sutherland [ bps ] ) , and two interior compositions resulting in slow and fast cooling ( solid and dashed lines , respectively ) .",
    "cooling curves without additional heating are depicted by thick lines , whereas thin lines show cooling curves for two models , proposed by epstein & baym ( eb ) and alpar , cheng & pines ( acp ) , for pinning of the superfluid vortices to the crust lattice .",
    "they correspond to strong and weak frictional heating associated with the dissipation of energy of differential rotation between the ns crust and superfluid interior ( only the eb model is available for the bps eos ) . in the same picture we plot boxes corresponding to the inferred atmosphere and bb temperatures of , assuming its age in the range @xmath163  yr , and similar boxes for the vela pulsar whose x - ray radiation was investigated in terms of the hydrogen atmosphere models by page et al .",
    "( we adopted @xmath164  yr for the vela age , between the conventional characteristic age @xmath165 and an upper limit estimated by lyne et al .",
    "we see that the bb temperature of  is well above the values predicted by all these cooling models , whereas the bb temperature of the vela pulsar is compatible only with the standard ( slow ) cooling model supplemented by strong heating for the stiff eos .",
    "the effective temperature of  obtained with the atmosphere fits is compatible , given the poorly known age , with the slow cooling models for all the three eos , at moderate or no heating . for the stiff eos ,",
    "it is also compatible with the fast ( quark ) cooling accompanied by strong frictional heating .",
    "however , the large ns radius for this eos would mean a distance @xmath166  kpc ( cf .",
    "3 ) , uncomfortably large in comparison with conventional estimates .",
    "the same cooling curve ( fast cooling with the eb heating for the stiff eos ) is the only one which goes through both the  and vela pulsar boxes obtained from the atmosphere fits .",
    "this , however , does not necessarily mean that slow cooling models or other eos or other heating rates are excluded .",
    "first , the  pspc spectrum of the vela pulsar , used in both bb and atmosphere fits , was not observed directly because the pulsar was not resolved from a surrounding mini - nebula of @xmath167 diameter , which makes the results of the spectral fits less certain .",
    "second , one can not exclude , in principle , that the ns of the vela pulsar differs from  ( e.g. , the mass of the former may be greater , that could lead to an `` exotic '' interior composition associated with an enhanced neutrino luminosity and accelerated cooling ) . finally , there exist many more cooling models than shown in fig .  4 , and some of them may satisfy both the  and vela pulsar temperatures . for instance , a strong neutrino emission induced by the nucleon cooper pair formation process ( see page 1997 , and references therein ) , which was neglected in most of the previous ns cooling models , may result in great variety of cooling curves , depending on the ( unknown ) parameters of the nucleon pairing ( yakovlev 1997 ) . for a more detailed comparison of the inferred temperatures with the cooling models , it would be very important to evaluate more accurately the distance to pks 120952 ( which would constrain the ns radius and hence the eos ) and the age of this object .",
    "there exist a number of other radio silent isolated ns candidates whose observational manifestations are similar to those of .",
    "the most convincing example is 1e / rxj 08204247 in the snr puppis a , whose bb temperature , @xmath168  k , and radius , @xmath169  km ( petre , becker & winkler 1996 ) , virtually coincide with those of .",
    "another example with similar properties is rxj 0002 + 6246 in the snr g117.7 + 0.6 ( hailey & craig 1995 ) , whose identification is , however , less certain because of its faintness ( likely , due to a larger distance and greater @xmath34 ) . we expect that applying the ns atmosphere models to the analysis of such objects will allow us to evaluate their radii and effective temperatures , and to constrain their magnetic fields .",
    "one more radio silent ns candidate , 1e  16135055 in the center of the snr rcw  103 ( tuohy & garmire 1980 ) , appears as a different kind of object  the bb fitting of its spectrum yields a considerably higher temperature , @xmath170  k , at a few times smaller radius of the emitting region ( gotthelf et al .",
    "however , this object is deeply immersed in the remnant diffuse emission so that it is hard to separate its spectrum from that of the snr , with the limitied spatial resolution of .",
    "we expect that the forthcoming @xmath171 and @xmath172 missions would resolve the point source and provide its spectrum suitable for the detailed analysis .",
