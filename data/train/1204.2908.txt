    "this hard x - ray emission is produced via accretion process by a neutron star accreting material from its companion be star .",
    "however , due to different physical and geometrical conditions in the accretion disc , the source has shown different types of x - ray activities . in quiescence ,",
    "4u 0115 + 63 exhibits low luminosity(@xmath19 ) ( campana et al . 2001 ) .",

    "the physical origin of the outburst mechanism is still unclear .",
    "negueruela & okazaki ( 2001 ) suggest that the distance at which the circumstellar disc is truncated depends on the orbital elements and viscosity .",

    "research about cyclotron resonance spectral features ( crsfs ) of this source has been carried out repeatedly with different observations since crsf was clearly detected as an absorption feature at @xmath22 kev ( wheaton 1979 ) using the data from heao-1 a4 . soon after that ,",

    "so that , 4u 0115 + 63 is the only object in the spectrum of which five cyclotron line harmonics were detected , making it as one of the best objects for studying the physics of cyclotron resonance in the polar cap regions of x - ray pulsars in binaries .",
    "4u 0115 + 63 was observed at different x - ray luminosity levels , and the fundamental energy of crsfs was repeatedly measured around 11 kev around the peak of the type ii outbursts .",
    "but the variations of the fundamental line energy were detected when we observed the source in the lower x - ray luminosity .",
    "the report from ginga ( mihara 1995 ; mihara et al .",
    "1998 ) found that during the outburst in 1991 , when the x - ray luminosity is about 7 times lower than the typical luminosity of the outburst peaks , instead of the familiar double absorption features at @xmath26 and 22 kev , the outburst exhibited a single deep and wide absorption at @xmath27 kev .",
    "the further studies suggested that the 11 kev fundamental energy line moves to @xmath27 kev in lower luminosity ranges instead of that the 22 kev second harmonic decreasing to 16 kev ( nakajima et al .",

    ", we analyzed both integral and rxte data of 4u 0115 + 63 obtained during giant outbursts and studied the temporal and spectral properties and variations during the outbursts .",

    "hence , we add the column absorption component in the fittings . but for the pca s data , because we ignore the energy channels below 4 kev , where photo - electric absorption is not prominent in the low energy band , therefore column density absorption is not included .",
    "the spectra of 4u 0115 + 63 during the outburst obtained by jem - x and ibis are shown in figure 5 .",
    "the fitted spectral parameters are presented in table 5 . for rev 675 ,",
    "the detection significance level of the source by jem - x and ibis is low ( @xmath28 ) , no line features could be found in the spectrum , so we do not include it in the following analysis .",
    "for the spectrum in the range of 3  100 kev by integral , we observed cyclotron resonance absorption features up to the 5th harmonic resonance energy .",
    "the fundamental line energy is determined at 10  15 kev in different epoches of the outburst .",
    "the second harmonic energy is around 22 kev , and the third harmonic energy is about 34 kev , and the fourth harmonic energy is around 42 kev .",
    "the fifth harmonic energy has a large uncertainty which varies from 49 kev to 55.5 kev , but the f - test shows this component might not be so significant ( probabilities are much higher than 0.01 ) , so we do not include the 5th absorption line in the spectral fittings .",
    "we also listed the probability of f - test , the result obtained through pca and hexte are presented in table 6 & fig .",
    "6 , only the first and second harmonic lines are detected . during our fitting",
    ", we found that the uncertainties of third cyclotron lines are very large .",
    "so we fixed the width at what we got when this parameter is freely fitted , which is 1.0 , in order to increase the confidence of the fitting .",
    "the position of the third line is always around 35 kev , which is not influenced by the fixed width .",
    "in addition , in some spectra obtained by ibis and jem - x , the iron line at 6.4 kev is too weak to convince us to add this feature into the spectra .",
    "previous authors have found that the iron emission line at 6.4 kev is not neglectable in the spectral fittings ( tammura et al .",
    "1992 , nakajima et al . 2006 ; mihara et al .",
    "2004 and tsygankov et al .",
    "2007 ) . here",
    "we have adopt the iron line at 6.4 kev with fixed width at 0.2 kev just as tsygankov et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have done .",
    "it does nt matter whether we initially add this additive component into our model , because if the iron line is not obvious , then it would be too weak to significantly affect the fitting result .    in figure 6 , the hard x - ray spectra of 4u 0115 + 63 from 4  50 kev with rxte / pca and rxte / hexte are presented . here , we select 6 spectra from the well fitted spectra of all observational pointings .",
    "indeed all of the spectra obtained by rxte have shown prominent iron emission line at 6.4 kev .",
    "since data of rxte only covers the energy range below 50 kev and spectral data points are not so significantly above 30 kev , we only detected the cyclotron absorption line features at fundamental line energy around 10 15 kev and the second harmonic energy at 22 kev .",
    "this source is observed continuously during the giant outburst in 2008 , which enable us to study the spin properties and accretion physics in details . in  .",
    "3.1 , we have fitted the data points to derive the spin period , and its derivative and orbital parameters .",
    "we found that the neutron star still undergone the spin - up process during the 2008 outburst . in the fittings , we have assume a constant spin - up torque @xmath29 .",
    "however , in the standard accretion model , the spin - up torque should correlate to its accretion luminosity .",
    "if we could build a simplest picture of the disk accretion , material is captured to magnetic field lines at @xmath30 and transported to the magnetic poles .",
    "we assume all the angular momentum carried by the material is transferred to the neutron star , for a keplerion disk , the neutron star would have a spin up toque as    @xmath31    a neutron star with moment of inertia @xmath32 would subject to the torque in equation ( [ eq : n ] ) , when enduring outburst with high luminosity , its spin up rate is given by    @xmath33    assuming the exhibited energy is from accretion , then all the gravitational potential energy of the accreted material would transport to the neutron star s surface , with luminosity    @xmath34    here @xmath35 is the radius of neutron star .",
    "hence we could deduce    @xmath36    if we adopt the parameter of neutron star as follows , radius @xmath37 , mass @xmath38 , moment inertia @xmath39 .",
    "the magnetic field of the neutron star could be estimated through cyclotron absorption energy we ve observed .",
    "the difference between the first and second harmonic cyclotron energy is 10 kev , if we adopt @xmath40 , hence z@xmath230.2 and b@xmath41",
    ". then we could get the value of @xmath42 .",
    "additionally , we could estimate the value of @xmath43 using the observed data during the outburst in 2008 .",
    "we can integrate equation ( [ eq : nul ] ) into equation ( [ eq : pspin ] ) , here the @xmath44 , then we fit the function with the data when the luminosity is declining from the peak .",
    "the measured @xmath45 is still similar to though is a little lower than the theoretical value , suggesting that the accretion model described above could well predict the spin - up processes of this neutron star system .",
    "it should also be pointed out that there still exist some uncertainties in estimating @xmath43 . in observations ,",
    "the distance of the source and the surface magnetic field of the neutron star still have uncertainties . in theory , the eq .",
    "( 7 ) assumes that the whole accretion power has been transported to x - ray luminosity , but in realty only part of the accretion power could transport to x - ray luminosity .",
    "anyway , using the observed data during the giant burst of 4u 0115 + 63 , we have firstly confirmed the relation of spin - up torque versus luminosity in this source .      in this paper , we derived the apsidal motion of the binary system by comparing different measurements .",
    "the apsidal motion can probe the gravitational field and the internal structure of the companion star .",
    "the methods and equations ( 9 @xmath23 11 ) follow other authors , e.g. kelley et al .",
    "( 1981 ) who discussed the apsidal motion in details , and raichur & paul ( 2010 ) measured three sources apsidal motion .",
    "they assume the spin angular momentum of the companion star is parallel to the orbital angular momentum .",
    "@xmath46 is related to the apsidal motion constant and the rotational velocity of the companion star as ( kelley et al .",
    "1981 )    @xmath47,\\ ] ]    with @xmath48    @xmath49    here @xmath50 is the ratio of the mass of neutron star to the mass of its companion , @xmath51 is the radius of the companion star , @xmath52 is the ratio of rotational angular velocity of the companion to the orbital frequency @xmath53 , @xmath54 is the full semimajor axis of the orbit .",
    "the apsidal motion constant @xmath55 describes the companion s internal matter density distribution .",
    "we adopt the parameter suggested by vacca et al ( 1996 ) and negueruela & okazaki ( 2001 ) , the companion , mass of v635 cas is about @xmath56 , with radius at @xmath57 , @xmath58 , rotational velocity @xmath59 , hence we could deduce @xmath60 . however , there are 70% uncertainty in mass and 30% uncertainty in radius of the companion star .",
    "if we include these uncertainties , it would lead to a larger error bar of 0.0041 . anyway the apsidal motion of the binary can put the constraint on the mass - radius relation of the companion star .",
    "we derive @xmath61 which is consistent with the value by tamura et al ( 1992 ) and raichur & paul ( 2010 ) .",
    "in  3 , we have obtained all the fitted spectral parameters of the x - ray binary 4u 0115 + 63 from both integral and rxte s data sets covering the outburst of 4u 0115 + 63 in 2008 april  may , when this source s x - ray luminosity changed from @xmath62 in the range of 5  50 kev , assuming the distance is 7 kpc . in this section ,",
    "the possible correlations between cyclotron absorption line parameters and continuum spectral parameters will be approached .",
    "specially , the variations of the fundamental line energy during the giant outburst and the possible physical origins will be briefly discussed .",
    "it is still hard to tell which factors could determine the cyclotron feature or the continuous spectra . in order to get",
    "an overview of all the related parameters in spectral fittings , we first present some parameters variations with observed time during this giant outburst .        in figure 7",
    "we showed the variations of the fundamental line energy @xmath63 and the photo index @xmath64 with observed time .",
    "the luminosity changes during the outburst are also displayed ( bottom panel of fig .",
    "7 ) , where we can clearly see the rising phase , the peak phase and deceasing phase of the whole outburst . in the plots ,",
    "we have shown both the spectral results by integral and rxte .",
    "the mean photon index @xmath64 is different for the two instruments during the rising and decreasing phases : @xmath65 for integral data and @xmath66 for rxte .",
    "this effect may be due to the possible different observing off - angle of the two satellite when observing the outburst and there are more absorption lines detected in integral s spectrum than rxte , which would also make integral s luminosity a little lower than rxte s .",
    "anyway , the interesting correlation and transition are discovered in our observed results . @xmath64 and @xmath63 vary nearly simultaneously , larger values ( softer spectrum ) of @xmath64 at @xmath67 kev while",
    "lower values ( harder spectrum ) of @xmath64 at @xmath68 kev .",
    "this correlation is valid for both integral and rxte data sets ( also see fig . 8) .",
    "more importantly , the sudden changes of both parameters occurred during the peak phase of the outburst , indicating that there would be a transition of this process in the rising phase to the peak phase and in the peak to decreasing phase . in the rising phase and decreasing phase , @xmath67 kev with a softer spectrum ; and in the peak phase , @xmath68 kev with a harder spectrum .",
    "we also noticed that in the spectral fitting of integral data from 3  100 kev , only during the peak phase , the significant column density absorption is detected ( see table 5 ) .",
    "this sudden changes of spectral property and fundamental line energy suggest that some physics results in this transition .",
    "the possible correlation between x - ray luminosity and @xmath63 have been pointed out before .",
    "we also display the possible relation between x - ray luminosity and @xmath63 in fig .",
    "9 . as we mentioned previously ,",
    "the derived x - ray luminosity from integral data is generally lower than that from rxte data ( by @xmath69 ) . for each instrument",
    "s results , we can see the possible correlation : higher luminosity with lower values of @xmath63 .",
    "but the sudden transition of the @xmath63 changes are clearly found rather than a real correlation function .",
    "for integral s data sets , when @xmath70 , we detect the familiar fundamental crsf at @xmath71 10 kev , below this luminosity level , the fundamental line energy changes to be @xmath71 15 kev ; while as for rxte s data sets , the criterion is around @xmath72 . for rxte data points , we also noticed that for the similar x - ray luminosity ranges ( from @xmath73 ergs s@xmath74 ) , both two fundamental line energies at @xmath10 kev and @xmath11 kev are detected , suggesting that the x - ray luminosity may be not the unique factor in determining the fundamental line energy variations .",
    "this transition is not complete yet because we do not get enough data points when the fundamental line energy distributes from @xmath75 kev during the sudden transition phases .",
    "burnard et al .",
    "( 1991 ) studied this luminosity dependent relationship , and assumed that the crsf is formed above the surface of neutron star at height @xmath76 in the accretion column .",
    "based on the dipole law of the magnetic field , the fundamental cyclotron absorption should follow the equation given below : @xmath77 where @xmath78 stands for the radius of the neutron star , @xmath79 denotes for the gravitational redshift . here",
    "we could treat the redshift item as a coefficient , for simplicity , we set @xmath79 = 0 .",
    "then we could describe the influence of height on resonance energy in a convenient way .",

    "( 1991 ) have given their estimation : @xmath81 @xmath82 is the eddington luminosity along the magnetic field , identical to the conventional eddington luminosity for a neutron star with a mass of 1.4@xmath83 , @xmath84 .",
    "@xmath85 is the ratio of the thomson cross section to the rosseland - averaged electron scattering cross section for radiation flows across the magnetic fields .",
    "here we adopt @xmath85 = 1.23 deduced by mihara et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "so we could employ the @xmath63 into the above equations , then estimate @xmath86 as a function of x - ray luminosity from our observations by integral and rxte .",

    "even we have treated data sets from integral and rxte respectively , our results could not confirm this theoretical model .        instead of",
    "this linear relation ship suggested as equation ( 14 ) , we find a phase transition similar to @xmath64 and @xmath63 .",
    "the trigger of the sudden transition may closely related to the luminosity of the source .",
    "as the luminosity increases above a certain level , condition might change suddenly instead of what equation ( 14 ) has suggested .",
    "besides , as shown in figure 10 , the @xmath86 ratio drops suddenly when it decreases to under 0.1 level , this trend could also be seen in the work done by nakajima et al . (",
    "so the mechanism of the fundamental cyclotron absorption may be affected by other unknown physical factors , or the magnetic field at the surface of neutron star might not be consistent with the dipole assumption .",
    "we also study the ratios @xmath88 and @xmath86 versus time of the outburst , as shown in figure 11 .",
    "since @xmath63 changes significantly during the outburst , while @xmath89 is relatively stable around 22 kev in the whole outburst , the variation of the ratio @xmath88 shows the similar behavior to the evolution of @xmath63 : in the rising phase , the ratio is about 1.3 , in peak phase the ratio switches to be around 2 , and in decreasing phase , the ratio returns to be near 1.3 .",

    "provide us an opportunity to study variations of all spectral parameters in this source with time and resonance energy during the 2008 giant outburst .",
    "a positive relationship between photo index and fundamental cyclotron energy is found ( see figure 8) .",
    "the evolutions of fundamental cyclotron energy and spectral properties with time during the outburst show the sudden transitions : at the rising phase , the source shows the soft spectrum with @xmath67 kev ; in the peak phase , @xmath68 kev with a harder spectrum , and high column density ; then into the decreasing phase , returning to the soft spectrum with @xmath67 kev . the luminosity dependence of resonance fundamental energy is also indicated in our observations , but in the similar luminosity range of @xmath99 ergs s@xmath74 , both two fundamental energies at @xmath10 and 15 kev are detected .",
    "so the physical parameters other than the single x - ray luminosity may play a role in determining the spectral properties during the outburst . instead of a positive relationship of @xmath86 and luminosity as expected , we also found a transition which makes a sudden change for the ratio ( below @xmath100 or around 0.2 ) , similar to fundamental line energy , which indicates that the environment near the surface of neutron star is much more complicated than we originally thought .",
    "this transition process during the outburst may require further studies both in observational and theoretical work .",
    "the x - ray luminosity should be a important parameter , when it reaches a certain critical value , sudden changes of accretion and radiation could occur or other physical conditions would change .",

    "<S> in this paper , we present both timing and spectral analysis of the outburst of 4u 0115 + 63 in april  may 2008 with integral and rxte observations . </S>",
    "<S> we have determined the spin period of the neutron star at @xmath0 s , and a spin up rate during the outburst of @xmath1 , the angle of periapsis @xmath2 in 2008 and its variation ( apsidal motion ) @xmath3 when comparing with previous measured values of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we also confirm the relation of spin - up torque versus luminosity in this source during the giant outburst . the hard x - ray spectral properties of 4u 0115 + 63 during the outburst are studied with integral and rxte . </S>",
    "<S> four cyclotron absorption lines ( fundamental at @xmath5 kev , 2nd harmonic at @xmath6 kev , 3rd at @xmath7 kev and 4th at @xmath8 kev ) are detected using the spectra from combined data of ibis and jem - x aboard integral in the energy range of 3  100 kev . </S>",
    "<S> two cyclotron absorption lines are measured from the spectra combining pca and hexte data in the energy band of 4  50 kev . </S>",
    "<S> the 5  50 kev luminosities at an assumed distance of 7 kpc are determined to be in the range of @xmath9 during the outburst . </S>",
    "<S> the fundamental absorption line energy varies during the outburst : around 15 kev during the rising phase , and transiting to @xmath10 kev during the peak of the outburst , and further coming back to @xmath11 kev during the decreasing phase . the variations of photon index show the correlation with the fundamental line energy changes : the source becomes harder around the peak of the outburst and softer in both rising and decreasing phases . </S>",
    "<S> this correlation and transition processes during the outburst need further studies in both observations and theoretical work . </S>",
    "<S> the known relation of the fundamental line energy and x - ray luminosity is confirmed by our results , however , our discoveries suggest that some other factors besides luminosity play the important role in fundamental line energy variations and spectral transitions .
