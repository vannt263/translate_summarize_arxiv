    "the study of casimir repulsion which always presented purely academic interest has moved in the last years to a more practical field .",
    "it is inspired by new precision measurements of attractive casimir force and the development of micro(nano ) electromechanical machines where the casimir repulsive force , if any , might resolve the stiction problem  ( see @xcite and ref . therein ) .    in the present paper",
    "we address the casimir repulsion between parallel plates owing to the optical properties of the material . from lifshtz formula",
    "@xcite it follows that the force between two parallel plates is repulsive if the gap between them is filled up with a material that satisfies the inequality @xmath0",
    "@xcite , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 stand for the dielectric permittivities of the plates , and @xmath3 corresponds to that of the filling  @xcite .",
    "we do not consider this set - up in the present paper .",
    "the force may become repulsive if one of the plates has nontrivial magnetic permeability , @xmath4 .",
    "this possibility was not seriously regarded since for `` natural '' materials , where the magnetization of the system is due to the movement of the electrons in the atoms , @xmath5 at visible range  @xcite .",
    "however in composite materials if the inclusions are smaller than the wavelength , but larger than the atomic size the effective dielectric and magnetic functions can be introduced as a result of local field averaging .",
    "that is why the artificial materials  @xcite with magnetic response arising from micro ( nano ) inclusions have recently become good candidates for observing the casimir repulsion .",
    "the casimir repulsion for materials with dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability that do not depend on the frequency was considered in  @xcite .",
    "the case of drude - lorentz dispersion relations for dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability of the metamaterials was analyzed in  @xcite .",
    "the upper limits for casimir attractive and repulsive forces between multilayered structures at finite temperature were established .",
    "starting from the lifshitz formula it was shown that at zero temperature @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the force between perfect conductors .    in  @xcite the casimir repulsion due to the presence of dispersive anisotropic materials with gain",
    "was first predicted .",
    "these media are beyond the scope of our paper .    in section",
    "ii we start from the basic formulas for the casimir force between two nonequal plates and give the conditions for the casimir repulsion .",
    "we consider several models for the plates and get analytic results for the force at short and long distances . in section",
    "iii the perfect matching metamaterial is discussed .",
    "we also consider recently reported optical range metamaterial as a candidate for casimir repulsion . in conclusion",
    "we discuss the possibility of getting repulsion within the design of metamaterials based on metallic inclusions .",
    "the casimir force between two flat mirrors separated by a distance @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 here @xmath10 , @xmath11 , are the reflection coefficients at imaginary frequencies for the mirrors facing vacuum @xmath12 with @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "the variable @xmath16 is the ratio of the transversal wave - vector at imaginary frequency @xmath17 to the inverse wave - length @xmath18 .",
    "the sign of the force is defined by the sign of the integrand in  ( [ eq1 ] ) . as @xmath19 ,",
    "a `` mode '' @xmath20 gives a repulsive contribution to the force if the corresponding reflection coefficients of the mirrors @xmath21 and @xmath22 have opposite signs .",
    "this happens if the mirrors are different , @xmath23 , and at least one mirror has nontrivial magnetic permeability . in",
    "@xcite it was proved that no multilayered dielectric mirror can reverse the sign of the force .    at the lower limit of the integral over @xmath16",
    "the reflection coefficients for te and tm modes coincide @xmath24 at the upper limit the reflection coefficients for te and tm modes are different : @xmath25 for fixed @xmath26 one can find the values of @xmath16 where the reflection coefficients change their signs : @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "we split the integral over @xmath16 in ( [ eq1 ] ) in two : @xmath29 and @xmath30 . in the former",
    "the integration goes from @xmath31 to @xmath32 , and in the latter from @xmath32 to @xmath33 .",
    "the reflection coefficients have no extremum with respect to @xmath16 . if @xmath34 , @xmath35 , then @xmath36 at all frequencies .",
    "when @xmath37 , @xmath38 is always negative , falling from @xmath39 to @xmath40 , while @xmath41 is monotonously growing from negative to positive values . if @xmath42 , @xmath41 remains positive and growing with @xmath16 , as @xmath38 decreases from positive values at @xmath43 to negative at @xmath44 .",
    "below we analyze the force in these situations considering drude or lorentz models for the mirrors .      when @xmath34 , neither @xmath38 nor @xmath41 changes the sign in the course of the integration over @xmath16 from 1 to @xmath33 .",
    "hence if both mirrors are non - magnetic the function  ( [ eq1 ] ) is always positive , and the force is attractive at all distances . as @xmath45 ,",
    "the contribution of the tm modes to the casimir force  ( [ eq1 ] ) exceeds the te contribution .",
    "for the mirrors described by the lorentz model @xmath46 , @xmath47 , at short distances @xmath48 , @xmath49 , with @xmath50 we get @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath47 , and @xmath54 .",
    "the absorbtion in the material influences more the small frequencies which make the decisive contribution to the force at large plate separations .",
    "that is why the relaxation parameters @xmath55 do not enter the short distance asymptote .    for the mirrors described by drude model , @xmath56 , the result",
    "is simplified to @xmath57 with @xmath58    the long distance limit is obtained by expanding the integrand in  ( [ eq1 ] ) in powers of the small parameter @xmath59 or @xmath60 and given by @xmath61      let mirror a be purely dielectric , @xmath62 . then @xmath63 .",
    "the mirror b is purely magnetic , @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "then both te and tm modes are repulsive at all frequencies , and the force _ is repulsive at all distances_.    the short distance limit for plasma models , @xmath66 , is given by @xmath67 the short distance attraction due to the interaction between surface plasmons is absent in the present case .",
    "the tm - plasmonic mode of purely dielectric mirror and te - plasmonic mode of purely magnetic mirror are not coupled , and therefore do not contribute to the casimir force .",
    "it results in the unusual short distance asymptote  ( [ no - pl ] ) .    at long distances",
    "we get @xmath68 the repulsive force coinciding with the first term of this expansion was obtained by boyer  @xcite for two non - dispersive mirrors with @xmath69 , @xmath62 and @xmath64 , @xmath70 .",
    "let the mirror a be purely dielectric , @xmath62 , with @xmath63 , and mirror b mainly dielectric , so that @xmath71 for all frequencies .",
    "then @xmath72 , and the contribution of the tm modes is attractive at all distances , whereas @xmath73 only for @xmath74 corresponding to mirror b. when @xmath75 the signs of the te reflection coefficients for the mirrors a and b are opposite .",
    "the sign of the force is the result of the balance between @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 .    if @xmath79 , then @xmath80 , and the contribution of te modes is entirely positive , @xmath81 .",
    "however as @xmath82 and @xmath83 , the total force is attractive ( negative ) . consequently ,",
    "when mirror b is mainly dielectric , @xmath84 , the force is attractive at all distances as well . at short distances",
    "it is determined by the modes of tm polarization and given by ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "let the mirror a be purely dielectric , @xmath62 , with @xmath63 , and mirror b is mainly magnetic , so that @xmath85 for all frequencies .",
    "then @xmath86 , and the contribution of the te modes is repulsive at all distances , whereas @xmath87 only for @xmath88 .",
    "when @xmath88 the signs of the tm reflection coefficients of the mirrors a and b coincide .",
    "thus @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",
    "the negative term @xmath92 becomes dominant for the tm modes at distances @xmath93 . at short distances the tm reflection coefficients are larger than the te ones .",
    "the total force is attractive for short plate separation and repulsive at middle and long distances . for the short distance asymptote see eq .",

    "varying @xmath100 one can see that the curves cross the horizontal axis when @xmath101 , in other words , when the material turns into mainly magnetic . for a metamaterial with @xmath102 ,",
    "@xmath103 ghz the force becomes repulsive at the distances @xmath104 m.",

    "it means that the transversal wavevector for the propagating waves @xmath114 .",
    "consequently , the reflection coefficients of the propagating waves vanish , @xmath115 , on the interface vacuum - metamaterial .",
    "let us consider two perfectly conducting mirrors one coated with a metamerial .",
    "equation  ( [ eq1 ] ) requires that @xmath116 and @xmath117 are real positive functions in accordance with causality  @xcite . obviously , this condition is not satisfied for the material with constant negative dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability .",
    "the straightforward substitution @xmath118 in the formula  ( [ eq1 ] ) for the casimir force leads to positive force at @xmath119 , and divergency at @xmath120 .",
    "moreover , the energy density of the electromagnetic field inside the non - dispersive material with @xmath121 is negative .",
    "therefore its very existence contradicts the pointing theorem , @xmath122 e^2 + [ \\partial(\\omega\\mu(\\omega))/\\partial\\omega]h^2 < 0 $ ] . on the contrary , the real parts of @xmath123 and @xmath124 may tend to @xmath113 at a certain frequency , leaving the energy density of the electromagnetic field positive , @xmath125    the casimir energy for a multilayered system given on fig .",

    "the maxwell equations are reduced to @xmath128 , for tm modes , and @xmath129 , for te ones , @xmath130 . to get the reflection and transmission coefficients and the phase shift one has to solve the system of matching conditions , two for each interface in each polarization : @xmath131 ,   @xmath132 ; @xmath133 ,   @xmath134 . here",

    "we arrive at the system for the coefficients @xmath143 , @xmath144 .",
    "then the transmission and reflection coefficients are given by the ratios @xmath145 , @xmath146 .",
    "the tm transmission and reflection coefficients are obtained by replacing @xmath147 .    with @xmath148 the scattering phase shift of the the four layered system",

    "when layers 1 and 3 are made of perfect metal , @xmath155 , we arrive at the casimir result @xmath156 with upper ( lower ) sign corresponding to positive ( negative ) effective distance @xmath157 and attractive ( repulsive ) force .",
    "the force diverges at @xmath158 .",
    "this result can not be recovered as a limiting case of any dispersive model of a metamaterial consistent with kramers - kronig relations .",
    "the account for finite conductivity of the metal and dispersion in the metamaterial leads to a finite result at a plate separation equal to the thickness of the mm - coating .",
    "[ fig8 ] ( right ) gives the reduction factor for the force between two equal mirrors one of which is coated with mainly magnetic metamaterial .",
    "the mirror a and the substrate of mirror b are described by drude model .",
    "the coating of mirror b is a metamaterial with effective permittivity and effective permeability given by drude - lorentz model .",
    "all parameters are normalized on the position of the resonance @xmath159 , @xmath160 ,  @xmath161 , @xmath162 ,  @xmath163 . here",
    "@xmath164 is the thickness of the metamaterial .",
    "for comparison we plot the reduction factor @xmath165 for two perfect metals one coated by perfect matching metamaterial .",
    "we see that if the mirror b is two - layered , the force changes the sign two times . for short and intermediate distances , @xmath120 ,",
    "the contribution of the reflections from the interface between the layer of the metamaterial and the substrate is small , and the behavior corresponding to bulk mm - mirror is reproduced ( compare with fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . at large distances , @xmath119 , the fluctuations `` feel '' the presence of the substrate , and the reflection coefficients approach the ones for the substrate .",
    "the force becomes attractive , achieving the values typical for metals .",
    "when the thickness of the metamaterial is smaller than its characteristic wavelength @xmath166 , the layer becomes transparent for fluctuations with @xmath167 , and the region of repulsion is considerably narrowed ( solid curve in fig .  [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "further we discuss recently reported low loss optical metamaterial  @xcite . for describing the material we use the effective media approach , considering anisotropic compound material as a homogeneous media having effective dielectric and magnetic functions . to evaluate the appropriate parameters of the effective media we took the complex permittivity and permeability plots from fig.3 in @xcite .",
    "for the dielectric permittivity we have taken the drude response with a small anti - resonance , the magnetic permeability has lorentz form , fig .  [ fig2 ] , @xmath168 with the position of the resonance defined by @xmath169 . though the amplitude of the magnetic resonance is larger than the corresponding dielectric one , the drude - type term dominates in @xmath123 .",
    "the magnetic permeability of the meta - material is described by a function which is characteristic for the dielectric permittivities of the semiconductors , for example silicon  ( fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "the calculation of the casimir force between golden mirror a and mirror b made of this metamaterial was performed with the following values of the parameters : @xmath170  ghz ,  @xmath171  ghz , @xmath172  ghz ,  @xmath173  ghz ,   @xmath174  ghz ,  @xmath175  ghz , @xmath176  ghz .",
    "the metamaterial being mainly dielectric , we predict no repulsion in the present setup .    the effective medium approach is valid for wavelengths longer than the `` lattice constant '' of the meta - material . to put it differently ,",
    "the theoretical estimations for the force are trustable for plate separations large in comparison with the `` lattice constant '' of the meta - material . for more accurate results",
    "optical data in a wide frequency range and for different incidence angles are needed .",
    "when one of the mirrors is mainly magnetic and its magnetic permeability is described by the drude - lorenz model the repulsion could be observed at the separations of the order @xmath177 . however the force decreases rapidly with the distance .",
    "that is why to get measurable casimir repulsion we look for a material with magnetic permeability @xmath4 at optical frequencies .",
    "non - magnetic conductive elements , such as split ring resonators ( srr ) , being embedded into a dielectric lead to nontrivial magnetic response of the compound  @xcite . a metamaterial with effective permeability @xmath178",
    "is obtained when a lot of such elements are oriented in different directions and positioned as cubic lattice  @xcite . as the effective resonance frequency is defined by the geometric scale @xmath179 of the resonator , @xmath180  @xcite ,",
    "the latter should be of several hundred nm size .",
    "though when the frequency of the field approaches the plasma frequency of the metal this estimation is not valid anymore , as the electrons become insensitive to the variation of the field .",
    "experimentally it was shown that geometrical scaling law for the resonance frequency brakes down at about 300 thz  @xcite .",
    "we seek for mainly magnetic material .",
    "the height of the magnetic resonance peak for a single resonator increases with the filling fraction . on the contrary",
    ", the interaction between the inclusions makes the resonance peak broader and lower .",
    "at the same time the metallic inclusions change the dielectric permittivity of the host media .",
    "it acquires the properties of diluted metal or highly doped dielectric with the dielectric permittivity dominated by the drude term . in other words , providing us with needed magnetic response the metallic structures add as well redundant dielectric permittivity , that makes the metamaterials mainly dielectric .",
    "consequently they do not manifest repulsion in the casimir set - up .",
    "the metamaterials based entirely on dielectrics are more appropriate . that could be , for example , arrays of dielectric spheres in a dielectric matrix  @xcite with the magnetic response arising from polaritonic resonances .",
