    "_ beltrami fields _ , that is , three dimensional vector fields whose curl is proportional to the field , are a particularly important class of smooth stationary solutions of the three - dimensional incompressible euler equations : @xmath1 in a way , what makes them so special is the celebrated structure theorem of arnold  @xcite , which asserts that , under suitable technical hypotheses , the velocity field of a smooth stationary solution to the euler equations is either a beltrami field or `` laminar '' , in the sense that it admits a regular first integral whose smooth level sets provide `` layers '' to which the fluid flow is tangent . in fluid mechanics ,",
    "a beltrami field is interpreted as a fluid whose velocity is parallel to its vorticity .",
    "understanding the knot and link type of stream lines and tubes in stationary fluids has also attracted the attention of many researchers , both from the theoretical and the experimental points of view @xcite , because knotted stationary vortex structures turned out to play a key role in the so called lagrangian theory of turbulence . from a numerical point of view",
    ", the description of the flows in the literature that allow for arbitrary vortex structures is mainly based on an active vector formulation of euler s equations ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the existence of knotted and linked vortex lines and tubes in stationary solutions to the euler equations has been recently established in @xcite using _ strong beltrami fields _ , that is , beltrami fields with a constant proportionaly factor : @xmath2 notice that the beltrami fields in  @xcite can be assumed to fall off as @xmath3 at infinity , and that this decay rate is optimal ( see the global obstructions in the form of a liouville type theorem in @xcite ) .",
    "concrete examples of beltrami fields with constant proportionality factor are the abc flows , whose analysis has yielded considerable insight into the aforementioned phenomenon of lagrangian turbulence  @xcite .    the main objective of this paper is to study the existence , regularity and stability results of _ generalized beltrami fields _",
    "( i.e. , beltrami fields with nonconstant proportionality factor ) .",
    "this vector fields play a fundamental role in the understanding of turbulence .",
    "the idea that turbulent flows can be understood as a superposition of beltrami flows has already been proposed in @xcite .",
    "they are also relevant in magnetohydrodynamics in the context of vanishing lorentz force ( _ force - free fields _ ) and they can be used to model magnetic relaxation , which is relevant in some astrophysical applications @xcite .",
    "indeed , to the best of our knowledge there are just a handful of explicit examples , all of which have euclidean symmetries , and the analysis of beltrami fields with nonconstant factor has proved to be extremely hard .",
    "the heart of the matter is that , as it was recently proved in  @xcite , the equation for a generalized beltrami field , @xmath4 does not admit any nontrivial solution , even locally , for a `` generic '' nonconstant function  @xmath5 . in a very precise sense , it shows that beltrami fields with a nonconstant factor are rare and such obstruction is of a purely local nature .",
    "these results have been carefully stated in appendix [ appendix.b ] for the reader s convenience .",
    "one of the aims of this paper is to show that , although generalized beltrami fields are indeed rare , one can still prove some kind of partial stability result .",
    "specifically , we will show that for each nontrivial beltrami field , there are `` many '' close enough nonconstant proportionality factor that enjoy close nontrivial generalized beltrami fields .",
    "the stabilility result is `` partial '' in the sense that a `` full '' stability result can not be expected since the space of factors that enjoy nontrivial generalized beltrami fields does not contain any ball in the @xmath6 norm by the above - mentioned obstructions.the analysis of stability can be crucial to shed some light on the interactions between the different scales in the study of relevant configurations in a fully turbulent state .",
    "more concretely , we will prove two stability results for generalized beltrami fields .",
    "the first one ( theorem  [ paso.limite.teo ] ) is an `` almost global '' perturbation result for strong beltrami fields defined on @xmath7 . roughly speaking",
    ", it asserts that given any nontrivial solution of   on @xmath7 with optimal fall - off at infinity ( i.e. , @xmath3 ) and any arbitrarily small ball  @xmath8 , there are infinitely many nonconstant factors @xmath5 , as close to the constant  @xmath9 as one wishes in @xmath10 , such that the corresponding equation   admits nontrivial solutions on the complement @xmath11 .",
    "this can be combined with the results in  @xcite to construct almost global beltrami fields with a nonconstant factor that feature vortex lines and vortex tubes of arbitrarily complicated topology ( theorem  [ beltramigeneralizado.tubosaunudados.teo ] ) .",
    "the second stability result ( theorem  [ perturbacion.local.teo ] ) states an analogue for perturbations of nontrivial beltrami fields with constant or nonconstant factor defined in a small enough open set where the field does not to vanish .",
    "the point of these stability results is that the perturbation of the initial proportionality factor is defined by recursively propagating a two - variable function along the integral curves of a velocity vector field , so that is the flexibility in choosing the proportionality factor that is granted by the method of proof .",
    "notice that the idea of constructing the proportionality factor by dragging along the integral curves of a field is somehow inherent to the problem , as the incompressibility condition @xmath12 implies that , if it is nonconstant , the factor must be a first integral of the generalized beltrami field , i.e. , @xmath13    let us outline the key aspects of the proofs . for concreteness , since all the ideas involved in the proof of the local partial stability result are essentially present in that of the almost global theorem , we shall only discuss the latter result in this introduction .",
    "as we have already mentioned , the point of the partial stability result is to develop a perturbation technique allowing us to deform the initial factor  @xmath5 , which for the purpose of this discussion can be taken to be a nonzero constant @xmath9 .",
    "this requires analyzing a related boundary value problem , namely , the _ neumann boundary value problem for the inhomogeneous beltrami equation _ with constant proportionality factor @xmath9 in exterior domains . to our best knowledge , this problem has not been directly studied in the literature .",
    "our analysis is based on a boundary integral equation method for complex - valued solutions which requires some potential theory estimates for generalized volume and single layer potentials and an analysis of the decay properties and radiation conditions of the solutions .",
    "they will be determined through the natural connections between the complex - valued solutions of the beltrami , helmholtz and maxwell systems .    in  @xcite ,",
    "the authors show that one can perturb a harmonic field ( i.e. , a beltrami field with @xmath14 ) defined in an exterior domain to construct a generalized beltrami field with a nonconstant factor . however , the perturbed fields and factors are of low regularity ( of class @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively ) . in view of the relevance and important applications of beltrami fields with nonzero @xmath9 ,",
    "we have striven to extend the result for harmonic fields to general beltrami fields , and also to show the existence of perturbations of arbitrarily high regularity ( the field will be in @xmath17 and the factor in @xmath6 for any fixed integer  @xmath18 ) .",
    "it should be stressed that the passing from @xmath14 to nonzero @xmath9 is not a trivial matter , since the behavior of the equations at infinity is completely different ( oversimplifying a little , for @xmath14 the behavior of the fields at infinity is that of a harmonic function , so one gets uniqueness simply from a decay condition , while for nonzero @xmath9 , beltrami fields solve helmhotz s equation , so radiation conditions must be specified to obtain uniqueness . ) we will present a detailed treatment of these topics ( section  [ beltrami.nohomogenea.seccion ] and appendix  [ teoria.potencial.tecnicas.seccion ] ) , since we consider that they are of independent interest .    the gist of the proof of the almost global partial stability result for strong beltrami fields is to study the convergence in @xmath6 of an iterative scheme that takes the form @xmath19 here , @xmath20 stands for an exterior domain with smooth boundary @xmath21 , @xmath22 is its outward unit normal vector field and @xmath23 is some open subset of the boundary .",
    "this is a modified grad ",
    "rubin method ( see @xcite for the original grad  rubin method in the setting of force - free fields perturbations of harmonic fields ) , which we will start up with a strong beltrami field @xmath24 of constant proportionality factor @xmath9 ( which can be assumed to exhibit knotted and linked vortex structures ) and prescribes the value @xmath25 of the perturbation of the proportionality factor @xmath9 over @xmath23 .",
    "notice that @xmath26 and @xmath27 are taken in a consistent way so that whenever they have limits @xmath28 and @xmath29 in some sense , then @xmath28 is a global first integral of @xmath29 and such vector field verifies the beltrami equation ( [ campobeltramigen.domgeneral.defi ] ) with @xmath30 .    our approach will be based again on the analysis of _ stationary transport equations _ along stream tubes and a sequence of inhomogeneous problems of div - curl type that we will call _ inhomogeneous beltrami equations _ and which are intimately linked to the helmhotz equation .",
    "in fact , we will start with the complex - valued fundamental solution of the helmholtz equation in @xmath7 @xmath31 and will arrive at a representation formula of helmholtz  hodge type for its complex - valued solutions .",
    "then , it is necessary to specify the optimal decay and radiation conditions that allow dealing with generalized volume and single layer potentials , namely , @xmath32 here , ( [ condcaidabeltrami.intro.form ] ) is nothing but a weak decay condition of the velocity field @xmath29 in @xmath33 and ( [ condicionradiacion.beltrami.l1silvermullerbeltrami.intro.form ] ) will be called the @xmath33 _ silver  mller  beltrami radiation condition _ ( @xmath33 smb ) and will be deduced from both the classical sommerfeld and silver  mller radiation conditions , whose connections with the helmholtz equation and the maxwell system are classical .    summing up",
    ", we will be interested in analyzing the existence and uniqueness of complex - valued smooth solution with high order hlder - type regularity of the general _ neumann boundary value problem for the inhomogeneous beltrami equation _",
    "( nib ) @xmath34 notice that although we were originally interested in real - valued beltrami fields , we will be concerned with complex - valued solutions to ( [ beltraminohomog.intro.eq ] ) and we will then take real parts to obtain the real - valued ones .",
    "the reason to do it is twofold .",
    "firstly , this will allow us to employ a representation formula for complex - valued _ radiating _ fields .",
    "secondly , this presents no problems related to the application to knotted structures as one can realize the fields in  @xcite as the real parts of complex - valued radiating beltrami fields .",
    "problem ( [ beltraminohomog.intro.eq ] ) was previously studied in @xcite , who proved @xmath35 regularity results in bounded domains .",
    "we introduce some potential theory estimates of high order for generalized potentials associated with inhomogeneous kernels in exterior domains and adapt the boundary integral method to the unbounded setting .",
    "we will also improve regularity from @xmath35 to @xmath17 .",
    "consequently , we will rely on the complex - valued counterpart of the modified grad ",
    "rubin method : @xmath36 where @xmath37 are the real parts of the complex - valued solutions @xmath38 .",
    "the compactness of @xmath39 in @xmath40 follows from some schauder estimates of equation ( [ beltraminohomog.intro.eq ] ) in hlder spaces .",
    "similarly , @xmath41 will be shown to be compact in @xmath42 too . concerning the application to solutions @xmath24 with knotted vortex structures of the kind constructed in  @xcite",
    ", we will see that the solution @xmath29 inherits the knotted vortex structures from @xmath24 ( up to a small deformation ) by virtue of structural stability .",
    "this is a straightforward consequence of the fact that @xmath29 can be chosen close to @xmath24 as long as the prescribed value @xmath25 is small enough .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ esquema.iterativo.seccion ] is devoted to study the iterative scheme ( [ paso.limite.esquemaiterativo.intro.form ] ) .",
    "first , we analize the linear transport equations in the right hand side and the convergence of the iterative scheme will then follow from the analysis of nib ( [ beltraminohomog.intro.eq ] ) .",
    "such problem will be studied in section [ beltrami.nohomogenea.seccion ] by extending the results in @xcite . by comparison with the _ vector - valued divergence - free helmhotz equation _ , the _ reduced maxwell system _ and the beltrami equation , we will deduce the appopriate radiation and decay conditions .",
    "the sbm radiation condition ( [ condicionradiacion.beltrami.l1silvermullerbeltrami.intro.form ] ) will then be connected with the classical silver  mller and sommerfeld radiation conditions and we will then present a representation formula of helmholtz  hodge type which involves these radiation conditions and that will be extremely useful to obtain our existence , uniqueness and regularity results . in section [ estructuras.anudadas.seccion ] we combine the above results to construct small perturbations of the constant proportionality factor @xmath9 leading to nontrivial generalized beltrami fields that exhibit the same kind of knots and links and so to construct stationary solutions to the euler equations . in order to support the above regularity results ,",
    "section [ teoria.potencial.tecnicas.seccion ] will focus on obtaining hlder estimates of high order for volume and single layer potentials associated with the kernel @xmath43 .",
    "the underlying ideas can be adapted to many other general inhomogeneous kernels with a controlled decay at infinity .",
    "the local partial stability result for generalized beltrami fields will be discussed in section  [ ch.local ] .",
    "finally , appendix [ appendix.a ] summarizes some geometric results that will be used throughout the paper and appendix [ appendix.b ] recalls , for the benefit of the reader , the results on the generic non - existence of generalized beltrami fields proved in  @xcite .",
    "let us conclude this introduction by summing up some notation that will be used throughout the paper without further notice .",
    "the notation regarding the domains can be stated as follows : @xmath44 although most of our results hold under weaker assumption on the boundary regularity ( specifically @xmath17 boundaries ) , there are certain results concerning a singular boundary integral equations which need @xmath21 to be at least @xmath45 because higher order derivatives of the normal vector field @xmath22 are involved ( see for instance theorem [ potencial.capasimple.regularidad.frontera.teo ] ) .    concerning functional spaces",
    ", we will essentially use the same notation as in  @xcite .",
    "let us agree to say that @xmath46 is the space of functions of class @xmath47 on  @xmath20 with finite @xmath47  norm ( meaning that all their derivatives up to order  @xmath18 are bounded ) .",
    "we will replace @xmath20 by @xmath48 when the function and all its derivatives up to order  @xmath18 can be continuously extended to the closure of @xmath20 .",
    "the space @xmath49 is the inhomogeneous hlder space with exponent @xmath50 and @xmath18-th order regularity .",
    "we will use similar notation @xmath51 , @xmath52 for functions defined on  @xmath21 .",
    "vector - valued analogues of these spaces are denoted in the usual fashion , e.g.  @xmath53 .",
    "in this section we analyze the existence and uniqueness of solutions in @xmath17 of the nib problems ( [ beltraminohomog.intro.eq ] ) arising in the modified grad  rubin iterative method ( [ paso.limite.esquemaiterativo.intro.form ] ) .",
    "the key tool is a representation formula of helmholtz  hodge type for its solutions , which we will combine with the well - posedness of the underlying boundary integral equation for the tangential components in the space of @xmath17 tangent vector fields to the boundary . for this we will need to improve some regularity results for high order derivatives of generalized volume and single layer potentials arising in the classical potential theory , which will require some potential - theoretic estimates for inhomogeneous singular integral kernels that are relegated to section [ teoria.potencial.tecnicas.seccion ] for simplicity of exposition . regarding the representation formula",
    ", we will introduce and discuss in detail the weakest decay and radiation conditions under which this formula holds ( namely , ( [ condcaidabeltrami.intro.form ] ) and ( [ condicionradiacion.beltrami.l1silvermullerbeltrami.intro.form ] ) ) , as this topic is of independent interest .",
    "notice that many other radiation conditions have been used in the literature for related models : the natural one for the scalar complex - valued helmholtz equation is the _ sommerfeld radiation condition _ and those of the reduced maxwell system are called the _",
    "silver  mller radiation conditions _ ( sm )",
    "( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "let us first recall some previous results in the literature on the exterior nib boundary value problem ( [ beltraminohomog.intro.eq ] ) .",
    "although the same problem is studied in @xcite for bounded domains and @xmath35 vector fields by means of a related approach @xcite ( which also establishes a helmholtz  hodge like representation formula for such fields and employs boundary integral equations ) , the technique that we present in this section has not been studied in the case of exterior domains and @xmath6-regularity .",
    "we recall that in @xcite it was essential to assume that @xmath9 is `` regular '' with respect to the interior problem .",
    "this is the case when @xmath9 is not a dirichlet eigenvalue of the laplacian in the interior domain , or if it is a simple eigenvalue whose eigenfunction has non - zero mean , so this condition holds generically ( as it can be seen e.g.  by considering arbitrarily small rescalings of the domain ) .",
    "related results for exterior domains are proved in @xcite .",
    "indeed , the technique used in bounded domain by  @xcite and  @xcite ( for @xmath14 and @xmath54 , respectively ) goes through to the case of @xmath14 and exterior domains via sharp estimates of harmonic volume and single layer potentials in @xmath15 .",
    "roughly speaking , the main technical difference that we will encounter here is that in our case @xmath9 is a nonzero constant , which leads to inhomogeneous kernels where the above estimates in unbounded domains are much harder to obtain .",
    "in fact , while these estimates are standard for @xmath14 , only estimates for the first order derivatives have been derived in the case of nonzero @xmath9 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , @xcite only considers @xmath35 estimates even for the ( easier ) interior problem .",
    "there is some literature regarding laplace s equation in less regular settings ( e.g. @xmath55 data and lipschitz domains ) . for @xmath35 domains",
    ", @xcite solved it via the analysis of harmonic measures and @xcite introduced a method of layer potentials .",
    "the latter looks like the method that we propose and is supported by fredholm s theory : some boundary singular integral operator is shown to be compact and one to one in the @xmath35 setting , leading to biyectivity and an useful lower estimate that entails the well posedness .",
    "for purely lipschitz domains , compactness does no longer hold @xcite whilst biyectivity is preserved @xcite . regarding non - symmetric elliptic operators @xmath56 in the half - space @xmath57 , the well posedness of the dirichlet problem with @xmath55 data @xcite follows from the method of `` @xmath58-approximability '' and the absolute continuity of the @xmath59-harmonic measure with respect to the surface measure .",
    "this section is organized as follows . in the first part",
    ", we analyze the representation formula , the radiation conditions and some existence and uniqueness results for the scalar complex - valued helmholtz equation .",
    "we will introduce there some classical notation and powerful tools like the _ far field pattern _ of a _ radiating _ solution not only in the homogeneous setting but also in the inhomogeneous one . in the second part we move to the beltrami problem and try to carry out the same program as with helmholtz equation .",
    "we will introduce the natural sm radiation conditions of the reduced maxwell system and will link them with the natural radiation conditions both for the inhomogeneous beltrami equation and an intimately related model : the divergence - free helmholtz equation .",
    "then , we prove the aforementioned representation formula and our existence and uniqueness results , which follow from the generalized potential theory estimates in section [ teoria.potencial.tecnicas.seccion ] along with the analysis of the well - posedness for the boundary integral equation for the tangential components . this will be studied in the last paragaph of this section .      the helmholtz equation with wave number @xmath60 in the exterior domain @xmath20 stands for the elliptic pde @xmath61 where the unknown is a possibly complex - valued scalar function @xmath62 .",
    "this equation arises in acoustic and electromagnetic mathematics @xcite and in the study of high energy eigenvalue asymptotics .",
    "the helmholtz equation also appears in the study of beltrami fields arising either from the incompressible euler equation or from the force - free field system of magnetohydrodynamics @xmath63 taking @xmath64 for @xmath54 one arrives at the following vector - valued equation @xmath65 since beltrami fields are divergence - free , then one recovers the vector - valued helmholtz equation in the domain @xmath20 .",
    "this relation with the beltrami equation suggests to study the representation formulas , radiation conditions and uniqueness lemmas for the helmholtz equation in the literature .",
    "first of all , let us define the next hierarchy of radiation conditions for a complex - valued scalar function @xmath66 .",

    "( @xmath71 ) sommerfeld radiation condition @xmath72    the following chain of implications is obvious : @xmath73 originally , only the strongest one ( [ condicionradiacion.helmholtz.sommerfeld.form ] ) was considered .",
    "however , several authors @xcite came to the conclusion that a weaker radiation condition ( [ condicionradiacion.helmholtz.l2sommerfeld.form ] ) may be assumed to obtain representation formulas and certain uniqueness results .",
    "although we follow the same approach , we weaken the radiation condition to an even weaker one ( [ condicionradiacion.helmholtz.l1sommerfeld.form ] ) by assuming some kind of decay at infinity that will be much weaker than @xmath74 though . as it will be shown later , both decay and radiation conditions can be recovered from the @xmath69 sommerfeld radiation condition for solution to the helmholtz equation . before showing that this radiation conditions leads to a representation formula of stokes type ,",
    "let us analyze them in the case of the fundamental solution to the @xmath75-d helmholtz equation , @xmath76 since @xmath77 a straightforward inductive argument shows that all the partial derivatives of @xmath43 up to second order verify an even stronger version of the sommerfeld radiation condition ( [ condicionradiacion.helmholtz.sommerfeld.form ] ) .",
    "hence we easily infer :    [ condicionsommerfeld.solucionfundamentalhelmholtz.pro ] the fundamental solution of the helmholtz equation , together with its partial derivatives up to order @xmath78 satisfy the identities @xmath79 for every @xmath80 . consequently , @xmath81 for every multi - index with @xmath82 .",

    "hence , the first step is to show the existence of beltrami field that possess the desired collection of vortex tubes and which is defined in a neigborhood of the boundary tori .",

    "kowalewski theorem that was proved in @xcite .",
    "however , this would lead to a local beltrami field defined in a region whose complement is not connected , and this should prevent us from applying any kind of approximation theorem ( this restriction is already present in the classical theorem of runge , and appears in all the approximations theorems known to date ) .",

    "the reason for which the estimates are subtle is that , from the point of view of kam theory , the situation is very degenerate because the twist condition is barely satisfied , and in turn this has a bearing on the power of the pde estimates that are needed to make the kam argument go through .",

    "<S> strong beltrami fields , that is , vector fields in three dimensions whose curl is the product of the field itself by a constant factor , have long played a key role in fluid mechanics and magnetohydrodynamics . in particular , they are the kind of stationary solutions of the euler equations where one has been able to show the existence of vortex structures ( vortex tubes and vortex lines ) of arbitrarily complicated topology . on the contrary , there are very few results about the existence of generalized beltrami fields , that is , divergence - free fields whose curl is the field times a non - constant function . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , generalized beltrami fields ( which are also stationary solutions to the euler equations ) have been recently shown to be rare , in the sense that for `` most '' proportionality factors there are no nontrivial beltrami fields of high enough regularity ( e.g. , of class @xmath0 ) , not even locally .    </S>",
    "<S> our objective in this work is to show that , nevertheless , there are `` many '' beltrami fields with non - constant factor , even realizing arbitrarily complicated vortex structures . </S>",
    "<S> this fact is relevant in the study of turbulent configurations . </S>",
    "<S> the core results are an `` almost global '' stability theorem for strong beltrami fields , which ensures that a global strong beltrami field with suitable decay at infinity can be perturbed to get `` many '' beltrami fields with non - constant factor of arbitrarily high regularity and defined in the exterior of an arbitrarily small ball , and a `` local '' stability theorem for generalized beltrami fields , which is an analogous perturbative result which is valid for any kind of beltrami field ( not just with a constant factor ) but only applies to small enough domains .    </S>",
    "<S> the proof relies on an iterative scheme of grad  rubin type . for this purpose , we study the neumann problem for the inhomogeneous beltrami equation in exterior domains via a boundary integral equation method and we obtain hlder estimates , a sharp decay at infinity and some compactness properties for these sequences of approximate solutions . </S>",
    "<S> some of the parts of the proof are of independent interest . </S>"
