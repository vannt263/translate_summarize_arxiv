    "the simplest mechanism based on perturbative qcd to explain quarkonium production , the color singlet model ( csm ) @xcite , is not able to describe charmonium hadroproduction .",
    "this model underestimates @xmath2 production , both in the central @xcite and forward @xcite rapidity regions .",
    "the data show that the bound state of heavy - quark pair is produced not only in the color singlet configuration , but there are additional states contributing to the final colorless vector meson . based on the non - relativistic qcd model ( nrqcd ) @xcite ,",
    "quarkonium production is understood as two - step phenomenon : @xmath3 pair production at perturbative level and the subsequent evolution to colorless vector meson through soft gluon emission at the non - perturbative domain .",
    "this argument is supported by the fact that the @xmath3 pair is produced at distance @xmath4 , @xmath5 standing for heavy quark mass , which is much smaller than @xmath6 , the typical qcd scale for bound - state system . according to the color octet model ( com ) formulation @xcite",

    "we use the usual spectroscopic notation @xmath10 , and the color state is indicated by @xmath11 for singlet and @xmath12 for the octet .    in the first approximation ,",
    "the @xmath13 system is produced in a color singlet state , which already has the quantum numbers of the physical quarkonium .",
    "the octet contributions are suppressed by powers of @xmath9 and @xmath14 .",
    "the latter is due to the extra soft gluon radiation needed to produce the correct color and/or quantum numbers . in principle",
    ", the state @xmath15 can produce @xmath16 mesons or evolve nonperturbatively to a vector meson .    at the partonic level ,",
    "the inclusive @xmath17 ( generically denoting the charmonium @xmath2 and @xmath18 ) is given by @xmath19 + x )   \\langle { \\cal o}_n^{\\psi } \\rangle , \\label{eq : ab}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 $ ] stands for the quark - pair in the generic state @xmath21 .",
    "we denote @xmath22 as the cross section for the short distance @xmath23-pair production , which can be calculated perturbatively .",
    "the matrix elements of the transition @xmath20 \\to \\psi$ ] , @xmath24 , can not be calculated in the usual perturbation theory .",
    "fortunately , they are assumed to be universal , and can be extracted from experiments .    of course , in principle one could argue that the dominant long - distance matrix element should be @xmath25 , the @xmath26 state already with the correct quantum number and color of vector meson .",
    "however , as already stated , from the fermilab experiments the csm itself can not explain the transverse momentum @xmath1 of the inclusive reaction @xmath27 .",
    "the csm differential cross section behaves like @xmath28 , falling much faster than the data .",
    "the @xmath1 dependence can be fixed combining the octet states @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , which is order of @xmath32 according to nrqcd expansion .",
    "particularly , the @xmath29 is fundamental for explaining a harder @xmath1 spectrum .",
    "if nature favors the vector @xmath7-wave octet state to evolve to a vector meson , there is a strong consequence on quarkonium production .",
    "because the @xmath26 bound - state is originated from gluon jet , the com predicts quarkonium to be transverse polarized on the limit @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that in this limit , the charmonium fragmentation function @xmath34 @xcite could be recovered @xcite .",
    "the @xmath29 plays the major role on the explanation of charmonium data at tevatron , however the same is not true at hera for @xmath35 , where @xmath36 . in this kinematic region ,",
    "the com predictions for photoproduction @xcite are dominated by the states @xmath30 and @xmath31 . moreover , in the ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors show that the polarization of @xmath2 produced from photoproduction depends only on the rate of the matrix elements of these states .    due to the universality",
    ", the values of matrix elements extracted from cdf data should reproduce hera data .",
    "however , the com predicts an excess of events compared with hera data @xcite for @xmath37 .",
    "this discrepancy could be explained by the higher - order qcd effects @xcite or by the intrinsic transverse momentum of the partons @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , it seems these tentative solutions can not reproduce quite well not only @xmath38 , but other relevant kinematic distributions @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we make a quantitative study of the com in the light of the experimental data and we show that is quite difficult to accommodate the @xmath2 production at tevatron and hera , simultaneously .",
    "even with the introduction of higher order qcd corrections , the com will face another challenge : the interpretation of charmonium polarization .",
    "the preliminary cdf analysis @xcite is pointing to unpolarized @xmath17 production , contradicting the com predictions .",
    "our strategy is at follows .",
    "we extract independently the non - perturbative matrix elements from both tevatron and hera data . after determining the solution that could",
    "satisfies both data , we show that actually it is incompatible to the polarization data .",
    "at the tevatron , the inclusive @xmath17 production cross section can be written as the usual form , @xmath39 where the @xmath40 is given by eq .",

    "the complete analytic expression can be found in @xcite .",
    "the sum over @xmath47 yields the unpolarized cross section .",
    "since we want to detect a vector meson , the lowest order at the partonic level should be @xmath48 process . at the tevatron ,",
    "the most important contribution comes from the subprocess @xmath49\\ ; g,\\ ] ] although @xmath50 and @xmath51 bring some contribution , especially for high @xmath1 .    at hera",
    ", there are two types of mechanisms contributing to distinct regions of @xmath38 .",

    "we have performed a numerical calculation of the charmonium production cross section fixing @xmath61 gev and choosing the renormalization and factorization scale to be @xmath62 , where @xmath63 .",
    "we make our analysis for three different parton distribution functions ( pdf s ) in the proton ; mrs ( r2 ) @xcite , cteq 4l @xcite , and grv 94 lo @xcite . for the resolved photons , we use grv distribution function @xcite . as the shape of @xmath64",
    "$ ] and @xmath65 $ ] are almost identical , we use the usual combination @xmath66 , fixing @xmath67 .",
    "evidently a careful analysis on @xmath68 , as well as @xmath69 dependence would bring to better control of the theoretical uncertainties .",
    "overall , even with an uncertainty with factor two , our conclusions still remain valid .",
    "nevertheless , we consider a case with @xmath70 gev for a more complete check .    as we point out in the introduction",
    ", we extract the non - perturbative matrix elements independently , for both tevatron and hera . from the fig .",
    "[ fig : pt_cent ] we can see that the com can accommodate quite well the cdf central @xmath71 direct @xmath2 production data @xcite .",
    "we should emphasize that the same set of matrix elements brings to an extraordinary agreement with the d0 forward @xmath72 @xmath2 production data @xcite .",
    "however , this is not a surprise , once we only fit these free universal matrix elements without any constraint .    in the fig .",
    "[ fig : z_h1 ] ( [ fig : y_h1 ] ) we show the @xmath38 ( @xmath73 , the rapidity of @xmath2 in the @xmath74 center - of - mass frame ) distribution for @xmath2 production at hera , and once again , it seems com can in principle fit well the h1 data @xcite .    in the table [ tab : matrix ] we collect the best set of the color octet nrqcd matrix elements that fit both data set independently for the three pdf s we are considering . for the color singlet contribution , we have used @xmath75 = 1.2 gev@xmath76 , following @xcite . since mrs ( r2 ) is calculated at next to leading order , it is not surprising that it gives a different result compared to the leading order ( lo ) ones .",
    "our numbers confirm the early results pointing out that at lo the com has trouble explaining both data simultaneously .",
    "as we mention in the introduction , this anomaly may be cured by adding corrections due to the intrinsic transverse momentum of the partons @xcite or higher - order ( ho ) qcd effects @xcite . for small values of @xmath1 ,",
    "the multiple - gluon radiations from the initial and the final state at the tevatron become sizeable . in the @xcite",
    "these corrections were estimated by monte carlo simulation using pythia @xcite and the ho qcd could be parameterized as a k factor dependent on @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "in fact , such corrections produce @xmath77 for mrs ( r2 ) pdf .",
    "this lower value of @xmath78 brings to a better agreement with the one extracted from hera experiments .    in the fig .",
    "[ fig : resumo ] we display a parameter space for the color - octet nrqcd matrix elements .",
    "although at 68% c.l . we still observe discrepancy between the bound for tevatron ho qcd corrections and hera , this picture changes dramatically at 95% c.l .",
    "we see that hera favors much higher values for @xmath79 than tevatron , however they are not severely constrained .",
    "the reason is that the state @xmath29 contributes only through resolved photon processes in a region where @xmath80 , roughly speaking . in this intermediate region ,",
    "the color - singlet contribution has a major role .",
    "actually , this is clear if we consider a different @xmath23-quark mass value . for @xmath81 gev",
    ", the state @xmath82 has a bigger contribution , much closer to the experimental data .",
    "this means the csm itself could describe the hera data reasonable well , except in the region @xmath37 .          from the expressions in @xcite , it is possible to calculate the quarkonium cross section for each polarization through the eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hadron ] ) and ( [ eq : parton ] ) . writing the polarization vector of quarkonium in the recoil ( @xmath86-channel helicity ) frame @xcite",
    ", we found the @xmath1 dependence on @xmath87 , as displaced in the fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] .",
    "the polarizations were calculated for seven @xmath1 bins , specified in @xcite .    at this point , we should be careful in comparing our results with the cdf preliminary analysis , once the data contain feed - down from @xmath88 , which contributes to @xmath89 35% , and @xmath18 decay to @xmath2 .    in order to avoid these extra contributions to the prompt charmonium production , we also performed analysis on @xmath18 productions , which do not receive feed - down contributions , neither decay of the higher states .",
    "although from the theoretical point of view the @xmath18 state is simpler to analyze , the available data @xcite are more limited statistically .",
    "we extracted the nrqcd matrix elements in a similar way we have done for @xmath2 .",
    "for the mrs ( r2 ) pdf , we found @xmath90 and very small value for @xmath78 , compatible with zero .",
    "following @xcite , we calculated the @xmath18 polarization for three @xmath1 bins , and once again the charmonium was found to be transverse polarized , as we can see from the fig .  [ fig : alpha_psip ] .      in order to satisfy polarization data ,",
    "the @xmath91 contribution must vanish , since the @xmath78 brings to a almost unpolarized @xmath17 production .",
    "of course , there is a penalty doing just adjustment by hand .",
    "the nice fit , _",
    "e.g. _ , fig .",
    "[ fig : pt_cent ] is no longer held . besides , the @xmath78 value should be increased in order to have a better fit . from the fig .  [",
    "fig : resumo ] , we see that this scenario will be disastrous if we compare with hera bounds",
    ".      * the complete qcd higher order corrections , which is not available so far , and contributions from higher @xmath26 states could in principle bring to a drastic change in the scenario . * the emitted gluons , in order to produce the physical quarkonium , are not so soft .",
    "therefore , the polarization of the @xmath26 system is not conserved during the evolution to non - perturbative regime .",
    "on the other hand , although it is a strong statement , we could argue that the evolution of @xmath13 system to a physical vector boson is not well understood ; the splitting between perturbative and non - perturbative regimes can not be done trivially .",
    "this means that nrqcd is not appropriate to describe quarkonium production . actually ,",
    "if we remember that for the charmonium the perturbative expansion is based on @xmath92 , maybe @xmath69 is not sufficiently small to allow such expansion .",
    "a closer examination on bottomonium states will be crucial to check if this state is held or not .",
    "although is still early to make any strong conclusions , it seems that the com is once again in trouble .",
    "at least in leading order can not explain simultaneously the tevatron and hera data .",
    "the existing solution , the implementation of ho qcd corrections , worsen the strong prediction of this model , the production of transverse polarized quarkonium .",
