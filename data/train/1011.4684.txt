    "[ sec : conclusion ] we proved the equivalence between @xmath0-bth and @xmath5-bth , derived the primary hirota equations of the @xmath0-bth , and found several explicit formulas about solutions for the bth using orthogonal polynomials in the matrix form .",
    "we also constructed some rational solutions of the bth which are parameterized by the products of schur polynomials corresponding to non - rectangular young diagrams .",
    "it may be interesting to find their significance in terms of the representation theory , as in the case of the original toda lattice where the rational solutions are given by the schur polynomials of rectangular young diagrams and they are the virasoro singular vectors . + * acknowledgments : * this work was carried out under the guidance of professor yuji kodama during my visit to ohio state university .",
