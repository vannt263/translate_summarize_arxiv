    "the production of strangeness carrying particles has been intensively investigated during long time in many experiments using a variety of beams , targets and energies .",
    "strange particles produced in proton - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus reactions interact with the hadronic environment not only by collisions but also by potential interaction which is expected lead to a change the particle properties in matter .",
    "numerous experiments performed during the past two decades had been aimed at studying the properties of the kaons , antikaons and hyperons in a strongly interacting matter .",
    "they were motivated by the theoretically predicted phenomena of the partial restoration of chiral symmetry in hot / dense nuclear matter and possible existence of an antikaon condensate or a presence of hyperons in the dense core of neutron stars ( see [ 1 ] for a recent review ) .",
    "the in - medium modification effects on the strange meson properties , mass and width , at nuclear saturation density can be described in terms of complex nuclear optical potential .",
    "it was established that the real parts of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 repulsive nuclear potentials amounts to 2040 mev at normal nuclear density @xmath5 @xmath6 [ 2 ] , while the attractive @xmath7 potential is more strong , although there is no common agreement about its strength so far .",
    "the calculations , based on chiral lagrangians [ 3,4,5 ] or on meson - exchange potentials [ 6,7 ] , predict relatively shallow low - energy @xmath7nucleus potential with central depth of the order of -50 to -80 mev .",
    "on the other hand , fits to the @xmath7 atomic data in terms of phenomenological density - dependent optical potential or relativistic mean - field calculations [ 8 ] lead to much stronger potential with depth of about-200 mev at density @xmath8 .",
    "the reported results of different measurements indicate that the values of the central depth of the potential are spread out over the wide range from -30 to -200 mev [ 9 ] .",
    "the recent data on the kaon pair production by protons off nuclei obtained by the anke collaboration do not favor a deep antikaon potential [ 10 ] .",
    "the imaginary part of the nuclear optical potential , which is responsible for the absorption of the strange mesons with both open ( @xmath3 , @xmath7 ) and hidden ( @xmath9 ) strangeness during their way out of nuclei , has been also studied by measuring the so - called transparency ratio [ 11 ] .",
    "these investigations provide the information on the in - medium meson width or on the in - medium meson  nucleon cross section .",
    "while essential progress has been made in studying the properties of strange mesons in nuclear matter ( see [ 12 ] for a review ) , much less attention has been paid to study the properties of the strange baryons in the surrounding nuclear environment .",
    "the large series of results on the @xmath2 and @xmath10 hyperon production in proton  nucleus collisions have been compiled in high energy region from 9 to 400 gev [ 13 ] , while the experimental information on their creation at lower proton beam energies is very poor although the search for medium modification effects here , in particular , in the near - threshold energy domain looks quite promising .",
    "so far , the only experiment here aimed at the study of the @xmath11 hyperon production in @xmath12nb reaction at proton beam energy of 3.5 gev has been performed by the hades collaboration at sis18/gsi darmstadt [ 14 ] .",
    "this kinetic energy corresponds to an excess energy with respect to the threshold of @xmath11 production in @xmath13 collisions of 0.63 gev and to a typical hyperon momentum of about 0.4 gev / c .",
    "however , the investigation of the possible medium effects has been out of the scope of the performed data analysis directed to the studying the most important features of the hyperon production .",
    "rich hypernuclear experimental information [ 15 ] enables to study the hyperon ",
    "nucleus interaction at ( almost ) zero hyperon momentum with respect to the nuclear matter .",
    "the in - medium properties of the hyperons at finite momentum , density and temperature have become matter of intense theoretical investigation over the past years .",
    "thus , the medium modification of the @xmath14 hyperon has been studied within chiral unitary theory with coupled channels [ 16 ] .",
    "it was found that at normal nuclear matter density the mass shift of the @xmath14 is small ( about 2% ) , while its in - medium width is more than five times bigger than the free one .",
    "the impact of the in - medium @xmath14 width on the hyperon yield from photon and proton  nucleus reactions has been analyzed in the frame of collision model based on eikonal approximation in [ 17 ] .",
    "the spectral functions for the hyperons have been evaluated in a self - consistent and covariant many - body approach [ 18 ] .",
    "attractive mass shifts of about -30 and -40 mev / c@xmath15 have been predicted for the @xmath16 and @xmath17 hyperons at rest at normal nuclear matter density , respectively .",
    "it was also found that the @xmath11 hyperon downward mass shift of about -30 mev / c@xmath15 at this density is quite independent of the three momentum , but its in - medium width is significantly increased as hyperon moves with respect to the bulk matter .",
    "the predicted mass shift for the @xmath18 is about -22 mev / c@xmath15 at saturation density .",
    "the in - medium properties of the @xmath11 , @xmath18 and @xmath17 hyperons have been investigated in the chiral unitary approach [ 19 ] .",
    "it has been found that at the @xmath11 , @xmath18 and @xmath17 experience an attractive potential of about -50 , -40 and -10 mev , respectively , at normal nuclear matter density and at zero momentum relative to the surrounding nuclear matter .",
    "the imaginary parts of the optical potentials of @xmath11 and @xmath18 hyperons are less in absolute magnitude than 10 mev , while that for the @xmath17 hyperon amounts to -50 mev at these density and momentum .",
    "in contrast to [ 18 ] , both the real and imaginary parts of the optical potential for all considered hyperons significantly change in the momentum range from 0 to 600 mev / c .",
    "recently the momentum dependences of the real and imaginary parts of the single - particle potential of the @xmath11 and @xmath18 hyperons in isospin symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter have been studied in chiral effective field theory [ 20 ] . at saturation density ,",
    "the real part of the attractive @xmath11 potential is between -(24 - 28 ) mev at zero momentum with respect to the nuclear matter , increases with the hyperon momentum and becomes positive ( repulsive ) at the momenta exceeding 400 mev / c , while a @xmath18 feels a repulsive potential even at zero momentum .",
    "cited in [ 18 - 20 ] values of the real part of a @xmath11 optical potential at saturation density and at zero momentum in the nuclear matter rest frame are somewhat different , but comparable to an empirical value of about -30 mev deduced from the analysis of binding energies of hypernuclei [ 15 ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the situation with , in particular , the @xmath2 hyperon  nucleus potential at finite momenta is still unclear presently in spite of a lot theoretical activity in this field .",
    "the experimental information about the momentum dependence of this potential is completely absent now .",
    "this information can be deduced from the analysis of the experimental data on the production of @xmath2 hyperons in coincidence with the @xmath3 mesons in proton collisions with c , cu , ag and au targets at an initial energy of 2.83 gev , taken recently by the anke collaboration at cosy accelerator .",
    "the advantage of such coincident data compared to the inclusive ones is that the lesser number of individual exclusive elementary @xmath2 production channels should be accounted for in their interpretation with the aim of obtaining the information on the @xmath2nuclear potential compared to that which has to be involved in the analysis of the inclusive data .",
    "that makes such interpretation more clear and allows for a reduction of the theoretical uncertainties associated with the @xmath2 particle production mechanisms .    in this connection ,",
    "the main goal of the present work is to give the predictions for the absolute yields of @xmath0 pairs from @xmath19 collisions in the kinematical conditions of the anke experiment which will be defined below by the equation ( 37 ) , adopting the collision model , based on the nuclear spectral function , for incoherent one - step and two - step @xmath0 pair creation processes in different scenarios for the lambda  nuclear potential .",
    "direct comparison of these predictions with the expected data from the this experiment will allow one to shed light on the @xmath2 potential in nuclear medium at finite momenta .",
    "the direct production of @xmath2 hyperons in coincidence with forward going @xmath3 mesons in the kinematical conditions of the anke experiment in @xmath19 collisions at incident energy of 2.83 gev of our interest can occur in the following @xmath20 and @xmath21 elementary processes with zero , one and two pions in the final statesrecall that the free threshold energies , e.g. , for the processes @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 amount , respectively , to 1.58 , 1.96 and 2.35 gev .",
    "we can neglect at beam energy of interest the subprocesses @xmath25 with three pions in the final states due to the proximity of their production thresholds in free @xmath26 interactions to this energy .",
    "thus , for instance , the threshold energy of the channel @xmath27 is 2.77 gev .",
    "this energy is close to the incident proton energy of 2.83 gev .",
    "hence , the subprocesses @xmath25 are energetically suppressed.]@xmath28 : @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34    let us now discuss the total cross sections of the reactions ( 1)(6 ) , which we will use throughout our calculations of @xmath2 hyperon yields in @xmath19 collisions .",
    "the channel @xmath22 has been extensively studied experimentally both earlier  mostly at beam energies @xmath35 2.85 gev [ 21]and recently  at initial proton energies @xmath36 2.5 gev by the cosy-11 , cosy - tof and anke collaborations ( see , for example , [ 2230 ] ) as well as very recently  at incident proton energy of 3.5 gev by the hades collaboration [ 31 ] .",

    "evidently , the dependence of the considered coincident @xmath2 spectrum on the @xmath2 potential should exist mainly at low lambda momenta ( cf .",
    "figures 710 given below ) .",
    "this means that the secondary pion ",
    "nucleon production processes have to be accounted for in the analysis of the data on @xmath0 pair creation in @xmath19 collisions obtained in the anke experiment with the aim of extracting the @xmath2nuclear potential .",
    "it should be noted that the relative roles of the individual @xmath0 production channels for another considered options for this potential at saturation density and target nuclei are similar to those , illustrated in figures 5 and 6 for its depth @xmath340 mev for c and au targets .    in figures",
    "710 we show the results of our calculations following equations ( 36 ) and ( 69 ) for the overall differential cross sections for the production of @xmath2 hyperons in coincidence with the @xmath3 mesons on c , cu , ag and au target nuclei in the kinematical conditions of the anke experiment , obtained for incident energy of 2.83 gev by adopting in them four options for the effective scalar hyperon potential @xmath118 at normal nuclear matter density indicated in the insets .",
    "it is indeed clearly seen that these cross sections are appreciably sensitive to the @xmath2 potential at momenta less than 1.8 gev / c for all considered target nuclei , namely : their strengths shift to higher momenta with increasing the @xmath2 potential @xmath118 up to 60 mev .",
    "the sensitivity of the strength of the low - momentum part of @xmath2 spectrum on the scalar lambda potential @xmath118 , exhibited in figures ( 7)(10 ) , can be exploited to infer this potential from the direct comparison of the shapes of the calculated @xmath2 hyperon differential distributions with those determined in the anke experiment . as an additional measure for the correlation between the above strength and the @xmath2nuclear potential @xmath118 we choose the average momentum @xmath346 , defined as @xmath347 , where @xmath348 are the @xmath2 differential cross sections presented in figures 710 .",
    "this momentum as a function of potential @xmath118 is plotted in figure 11 .",
    "one can see that the carbon nucleus is not optimal for determining this potential .",
    "the highest sensitivity to it we have for heavy silver and gold target nuclei .",
    "thus , for example , for gold nucleus the difference between the mean momenta @xmath346 , corresponding to the @xmath2 potential at saturation density @xmath340 mev and @xmath343 mev , is 166 mev / c . whereas the same difference for carbon target nucleus is only 87",
    "mev / cit is interesting to note that the analogous difference between the average momenta , corresponding to the high - momentum region of 1.82.9 gev / c of the @xmath2 spectrum on au nucleus as well as to the same potentials @xmath340 mev and @xmath343 mev , amounts , as showed our calculations , to 42 mev / c , what demonstrates very moderate sensitivity of the considered momentum distributions to the adopted @xmath2 in - medium modification scenarios also at high momenta of interest.]@xmath28 .",
    "therefore , a comparison above results with the experimentally determined average momentum in the low - momentum part of the @xmath2 spectrum on heavy target nuclei under consideration will also allow one to deduce the effective scalar potential @xmath118 in cold nuclear matter at this momentumit should be noted that an analogous possibility was recently realized for the @xmath349 mesons in [ 69].]@xmath28 . knowing this potential and using the relations ( 19 ) , ( 20 )",
    ", we can easily recover the single - particle potential @xmath135 at saturation density for in - medium momentum @xmath130 , corresponding to the experimentally determined average momentum @xmath346 .",
    "such data point may help to discriminate between the existing models of the @xmath119 interaction at finite momenta .",
    "thus , we come to the conclusion that the coincident observables considered above can be useful to help determine the lambda  nucleus optical potential at finite momentum .",
    "in this paper we calculated the momentum dependences of the absolute differential cross sections for the production of @xmath2 hyperons in coincidence with the @xmath3 mesons from @xmath19 ( @xmath162=c , cu , ag , and au ) collisions at 2.83 gev beam energy in the kinematical conditions of the anke experiment , performed at cosy , by considering incoherent primary proton ",

    "the above opens a good possibility to determine this potential here from the direct comparison of the presented in the work results with the data from the anke - at - cosy experiment .",
