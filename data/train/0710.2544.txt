    "orientifold compactifications of type iib string theory on a calabi - yau threefold in the presence of d3 and d7 branes can be geometrically described by f - theory compactified on a calabi - yau fourfold @xcite .",
    "type iib is defined in a ten - dimensional minkowski space while f - theory requires two additional dimensions , which provide a geometric description of the axion - dilaton field of type iib as the complex structure of an elliptic curve ( a two - torus ) .",
    "solutions of type iib at weak coupling usually have a constant axion - dilaton field .",
    "f - theory provides a description of solutions with a variable axion - dilaton field by allowing the elliptic curve to be non - trivially fibered over a threefold .",
    "this construction provides a beautiful identification of s - duality in type iib as the modular group of the elliptic curve .",
    "type iib and f - theory are both severely constrained by ` tadpole conditions ' which ensure that the total d - brane charges in a compact space vanish as required by gauss s law .",
    "tadpole conditions realize the physics wisdom according to which , in a compact space , the total charge should vanish since fluxes can not escape to infinity . from a dynamical perspective ,",
    "tadpole conditions are consistency requirements obtained from the local equations of motion and/or the bianchi identities by integrating them over appropriate compact spaces .",
    "the computation of tadpole conditions requires a detailed account of all contribution to the d - brane charges .",
    "this is closely related to anomaly cancellations since the presence of chern - simons terms in the d - brane action ( needed for the cancellation of chiral and tensor anomalies ) implies that a d - brane usually carries lower brane charges .",
    "in particular , in type iib , a seven - brane has an induced d3 charge proportional to the euler characteristic of the complex surface ( a cycle of real dimension four in the calabi - yau threefold ) on which it is wrapped . in f - theory ,",
    "the induced d3 charge is proportional to the euler characteristic of the calabi - yau fourfold .",
    "it follows that in the absence of other sources of d3 charge ( like for example non - trivial fluxes ) , the consistency of the f - theory / type iib tadpole relations leads to relations between the euler characteristics of the f - theory fourfolds and the surfaces wrapped by the seven - branes .",
    "the link between type iib orientifolds and f - theory is clearly expressed in the case of @xmath0-orientifold symmetry by sen s weak coupling limit of f - theory @xcite .",
    "when the fourfold is realized as an elliptic fibration over a threefold , and sen s weak coupling limit is used to produce the associated calabi - yau threefold , the relations can be recovered , as we show in this paper , at the price of dealing with singularities of the loci arising in the limit . in this paper",
    "we analyze one representative class of examples of this situation , presenting both the physical argument leading to the relation (  [ phy ] ) , and a mathematical derivation of an identity of chern classes which implies it (  [ math ] ) . in its form arising from physical considerations ,",
    "the relation has the following shape .",
    "let @xmath1 be an @xmath2 elliptic fibration over a nonsingular threefold  @xmath3 , and assume that @xmath4 is a calabi - yau variety .",
    "following sen ( @xcite ) , we can associate with @xmath4 a calabi - yau threefold @xmath5 , obtained as the double cover @xmath6 ramified along a nonsingular surface  @xmath7 ; at ` weak coupling limit ' , the discriminant of @xmath8 determines an orientifold supported on @xmath7 , and a d7-brane supported on a surface @xmath9 in @xmath5 . comparing the d3 tadpole condition as seen in f - theory and in type iib leads to the ( tentative ) relation @xmath10 among euler characteristics ( cf .   [ phytadc ] ) .",
    "however , the surface @xmath9 is singular , and singular varieties admit several possible natural notions of ` euler characteristic ' ; it is not _ a priori _ clear which one should be employed as @xmath11 in ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "by contrast @xmath4 and  @xmath7 are both nonsingular , and @xmath13 , @xmath14 must refer to the usual topological euler characteristic .",
    "analyzing this situation with mathematical tools , we can prove ( theorem  [ tadpole ] ) that in fact the relation ( @xmath12 ) holds at the level of total homology chern classes , provided that suitable correction terms are factored in to account for the singularities of @xmath9 : @xmath15 implying @xmath16 here , @xmath17 is a resolution of @xmath9 ( in fact , its normalization ) , @xmath18 is the composition @xmath19 , and @xmath20 stands for the pinch locus of @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath21 ( the case of physical interest ) , @xmath22 simply counts the number of pinch - points of @xmath9 .",
    "however ( and surprisingly ) ( @xmath23 ) holds in arbitrary dimension , and independently of calabi - yau hypotheses .",
    "thus , it appears that the scope of the tadpole conditions is actually substantially more general than the context in which they arise .",
    "the term @xmath24 could be interpreted as the ( push - forward to @xmath3 of the ) _ stringy chern class _ of @xmath9 , and the question remains of whether the corrected class @xmath25 , resp .",
    "its degree @xmath26 , are mathematically ` natural ' notions .",
    "we take a stab at this question in  [ spec ] , where a mechanism is proposed which appears to account precisely for the needed correction term , at least in the class of examples considered in this paper .",
    "we point out that the ingredients used to define the stringy chern class ( as in @xcite ) may in fact be employed to define other notions of chern classes and euler characteristics @xmath27 for singular varieties , depending on a parameter  @xmath28 .",
    "each value of this parameter corresponds to a different candidate for ` relative canonical divisor ' of the resolution map ; for the examples considered in this paper , @xmath29 corresponds to the notion leading to stringy invariants , while @xmath30 corresponds to an alternative notion ( leading to ` arc ' invariants ; the @xmath31-flavor considered in @xcite ) . as we will see in",
    " [ spec ] , @xmath27 admits a well - defined limit as @xmath32 ; and this euler characteristic @xmath33 recovers precisely the relation ( @xmath12 ) proposed by the string - theoretic considerations ( theorem  [ mf ] ) .",
    "therefore , this appears to be the natural notion in the context of this problem .",
    "however , there is room for surprises , and it is not impossible that in more general situations the singularities modify the tapdole relation in a different ways than we have anticipated here .",
    "although this will have no effect on the correctness of the mathematical result of this paper ( the physics providing just an ansatz from the mathematical perspective ) it would surely reshape the physics . to settle the issue , a complete physical derivation of the tapdole conditions taking into account",
    "the singularities would be appropriate .",
    "tadpole conditions in string theory are usually obtained by a loop calculation or by using the inflow mechanism .",
    "both roads have their shortcoming in presence of singularities .",
    "it is therefore refreshing to know that the point of view presented in this paper is corroborated by an analysis of different physical aspects of the system ( @xcite ) .",
    "in particular it is shown in ( @xcite ) that the choice of the euler characteristic @xmath33 is compatible with a `` deconstruction '' description of the brane configuration in terms of a system of d9-anti - d9 branes with appropriate world - volume fluxes turn on .",
    "this paper is aimed at both physicists and mathematicians ;  [ phy ] is written with the former public in mind , and   [ math ] with the latter . in order to enhance readability , these sections are essentially independent of each other , and the hurried reader of one sort may ignore the section more squarely written for the other .",
    "but the most interesting aspect of our results lies in the interplay between the two viewpoints .",
    "we include in this introduction a few slightly more technical comments . the chern class identity we prove ( theorem  [ tadpole ] ) holds in arbitrary dimension , for varieties which are not necessarily calabi - yau , and generalizes in the simplest possible way the relation among euler characteristics predicted by the tadpole condition presented in  [ phytadc ] .",
    "in fact , theorem  [ tadpole ] is established by lifting to this level of generality the elementary _ sethi - vafa - witten formula _",
    "( formula ( 2.12 ) in  @xcite ) for the euler characteristic of the fibration  @xmath4 , and comparing it with an analogous formula obtained at sen s weak coupling limit .",
    "we view the sethi - vafa - witten formula as a general statement equating the euler characteristic of the fibration with twice the euler characteristic of a specific divisor @xmath34 in the base @xmath3 of the fibration ( proposition  [ svwform ] ) .",
    "the arguments in  [ math ] are streamlined by using the calculus of _ constructible functions , _ which encodes the good properties of topological euler characteristic and ( by a result of r.  macpherson ) of chern classes .",
    "the relevant facts are recalled in ",
    "[ math ] . as a concrete example , we offer the following instance of the situation considered in this article .",
    "[ 23328 ] a degree  24 hypersurface with equation @xmath35 in weighted projective space @xmath36 ( with @xmath37 , resp .",
    "@xmath38 of degree @xmath39 , resp .",
    "@xmath40 , and @xmath41 , @xmath42 general polynomials in the other variables ) determines a calabi - yau elliptic fibration @xmath8 , with @xmath43 .",
    "standard methods ( for example , judicious use of the adjunction formula ) easily yield @xmath44 .",
    "sen s weak coupling limit leads us to consider surfaces @xmath7 , resp .",
    "@xmath45 in @xmath46 with equation @xmath47 , resp .",
    "@xmath48 , where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 are general polynomials of degrees  @xmath40 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 respectively .",
    "again , adjunction yields immediately that @xmath54 ; as for @xmath45 , the presence of @xmath55 nodes at the intersection @xmath20 given by @xmath56 has to be taken into account , and gives @xmath57 .",
    "the associated calabi - yau threefold  @xmath5 at weak coupling limit is the double cover of @xmath46 branched over @xmath7 ; @xmath9 is the inverse image of @xmath45 in @xmath5 .",
    "the orientifold and d7 brane are localized on @xmath7 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "a simple local analysis shows that @xmath9 is singular along a curve , with a set @xmath20 of @xmath58 pinch - points corresponding to the set @xmath59 of nodes on @xmath45 .",
    "it also shows that @xmath9 may be resolved to a nonsingular surface @xmath60 by blowing up the singular curve ; the composition @xmath61 is found to be @xmath62-to-@xmath63 everywhere except over @xmath59 . in terms of constructible functions , this says that the push - forward of the constant function  @xmath64  is @xmath65 the function which equals @xmath62 on @xmath66 and @xmath63 on @xmath59 .",
    "it follows then immediately that @xmath67 what s more , the same relation must hold among the total chern classes of these loci ( cf .",
    "property ( 2 )  in  [ math ] ) .",
    "we stress that more sophisticated intersection - theoretic tools are _ not _ needed in order to extract this information from the blow - up @xmath17 .",
    "these simple considerations suffice to verify the tadpole relation with pinch - point correction in this example : @xmath68    note that ignoring singularities would have led us to an embarrassing tadpole mismatch between type iib and f - theory at weak coupling of the present paper . ] . the proof presented in ",
    "[ math ] for the general case ( at the level of chern classes , in arbitrary dimension and without calabi - yau hypotheses ) is no harder  modulo some intersection theory  than the proof sketched above for example  [ 23328 ] .",
    "indeed , the key observation in the proof of theorem  [ tadpole ] is precisely the same formula @xmath69 used above , which is just as easy to prove in general as in example  [ 23328 ] . in   [ math ] we also offer an alternative , slightly more sophisticated viewpoint on such relations of constructible functions ( by means of _ verdier specialization _ , see remark  [ verdier ] ) as a possible venue for more general results .",
    "intersection - theoretic invariants of singular varieties , including some computations involving blow - ups , also play a role in @xcite , in a comparison between the @xmath70 heterotic string and f - theory with g - fluxes .",

    "in this section we present in some detail the physical motivation for ( @xmath12 ) . roughly speaking",
    ", it results from a direct comparison of the d3 brane tadpole condition in type iib and in f - theory in the situation where no fluxes are turned on .",
    "we will introduce the necessary notions in a pedagogic way from (  [ typeii ] ) to (  [ tadcons ] ) ; readers familiar with sen s weak coupling limit of f - theory , tadpole conditions , and dualities , could consider jumping immediately to (  [ phytadc ] ) , without great harm . in (",
    " [ typeii ] ) , we give some basic notions on d - branes in type ii string theories ; in (  [ dualities ] ) we review the ( s - t - u-)dualities among type iia , type iib and m - theory .",
    "these dualities are important to understand the dictionary between the physics and the geometry of f - theory and m - theory ; they also provide an elegant derivation of the f - theory d3 brane tadpole condition .",
    "f - theory is introduced in (  [ ftheory ] ) and sen s weak coupling limit is reviewed in (  [ e8fibs ] ) .",
    "tadpoles and anomalies are discussed in (  [ tadcons ] ) ; the case of a @xmath0 orientifold of type iib with o7-planes and d3 and d7 branes as well as the d3 tadpole condition in f - theory are worked out in detail .    in (  [ phytadc ] ) , we derive a general form of the relation ( @xmath12 ) from  [ intro ] with several possible d7 branes and o7-planes . relation ( @xmath12 ) , with only one d7 and one o7 branes , is the generic situation in sen s weak coupling limit .",
    "however , since singularities are necessarily present in sen s weak coupling limit , ( @xmath12 ) must be modified to take them into account . assuming that the final answer keeps the same shape , we give evidence that the modified formula would be of type of the relation ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "this will be confirmed in  [ math ] , where we analyze sen s template situation in its natural mathematical setting , and prove formula ( @xmath23 ) ( which implies ( @xmath71 ) ) for a larger class of varieties . for those who are mostly interested in the calabi - yau case , we note that ( @xmath71 ) could be proved just by mimicking the treatment of example [ 23328 ] , using no more than the adjunction formula in the spirit of ( @xcite ) . while this computation is straightforward , the material in  [ math ] provides a deeper understanding of the geometry of the situation .",
    "there are five consistent ten - dimensional string theories . here",
    "we will mostly be interested in type iia and iib string theories .",
    "each of these two theories admit 32 supersymmetry generators organized into two ten - dimensional majorana - weyl spinors with opposite chirality in type iia and the same chirality in type iib .",
    "both theories contain in their spectrum the following ns - ns ( _ neveu - schwarz _ ) fields : a graviton , an antisymmetric two - form which couples to the fundamental string , and a scalar field @xmath72 ( called the _ dilaton _ ) which controls the string coupling @xmath73 in each of these theories , following the relation @xmath74 .",

    "a @xmath75-form naturally couples to an object extended in @xmath77-spatial dimension .",
    "indeed , as it evolves in spacetime , a @xmath77-brane draws a world - volume @xmath78 of spacetime dimension @xmath75 on which the @xmath75 potential @xmath76 can be evaluated as @xmath79 .",
    "a @xmath77-brane charged under a @xmath75-form admits a magnetic dual which is a @xmath80-brane , where @xmath81 is the spacetime dimension of the ambient space in which the brane lives .",
    "they are related by hodge - conjugation @xmath82 acting on their field strengths @xmath83 .",
    "the objects that carry the rr charges are not seen in perturbative string theory .",
    "it was realized by polchinski ( @xcite ) that @xmath77-branes are actually naturally present in string theory as loci on which open strings can end .",
    "for that reasons , they are usually called _ dirichlet @xmath77-branes _ or ( _ d@xmath77-branes _ ) since fixing the location of the ends of open strings is realized by imposing dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "d - branes are _ half - bps objects _ , which means they preserve only half of the total amount supersymmetry . a string with its two ends on the same d - brane defines a @xmath84 gauge field ( a @xmath84 bundle with a connection ) on the world - volume of the brane",
    "this is the _ chan - paton bundle_. note that since it is defined from an open string , the chan - paton gauge field defined on the world - volume of a d - brane is a ns - ns field .",

    "now that we have set the stage , we can address one doubt that may be lingering in the mind of the reader : is it truly necessary to invoke the presence of singularities in order to verify the tadpole condition ? might there not exist simpler configurations , consisting of d - branes supported on nonsingular surfaces , and simply satisfying the euler characteristic constraints imposed by the tadpole condition ?    in general ( but with one notable exception ,",
    "see below ) this appears not to be the case : the relations are known not to hold when applied to examples where all loci are assumed to be smooth ( @xcite ) .    in f - theory , the seven - branes only wrap surfaces over which the elliptic fibration is singular .",
    "this restricts seriously the allowed configurations .",
    "for example , if we restrict ourself to @xmath0-orientifolds , in type iib , the typical d7 configuration is composed of an o7-plane and a d7-brane ; they wrap two complex surfaces that intersect along a curve .",
    "the d7 tadpole condition defines a linear relation among the homology cycles of these two surfaces .    in the case at hand ,",
    "the o7 is supported on a smooth surface of class @xmath226 in the calabi - yau threefold @xmath5 ; the d7 tadpole condition forces the d7 to be supported on a surface or an union of surfaces of total class @xmath227 .",
    "now , if we assume that the d7 is supported on a single , smooth surface , then adjunction shows immediately that the tadpole matching condition of iib and f - theory will simply _ not _ be satisfied . from a type iib perspective , without any input from sen s sharp description of the orientifold limit of f - theory , this would have been the typical configuration and would have not satisfied the tadpole matching condition of iib and f - theory .",
    "however , this mismatch can be attributed to a naive identification of the typical configuration .",
    "assuming that the d7 is wrapped on a union of general smooth surfaces of varying classes equal to multiples of @xmath226 , one can verify ( again using adjunction ) that the matching is obtained for precisely one configuration : the o7-plane and two d7 branes wrapped around surfaces of classes @xmath226 , @xmath228 , respectively .",
    "however , this configuration does not seem to be compatible with sen s description of the orientifold limit of f - theory .",
    "thus , singularities in the support of the d7 brane do appear to be a necessary feature of the situation , at least from the point of view of sen s limit .",
    "as we have illustrated in example  [ 23328 ] , and as we are going to verify in general in  [ math ] , it is possible to satisfy the tadpole conditions within sen s description , if we take seriously the presence of singularities .",
    "the identity we will obtain by doing so will in fact realize the tadpole conditions at the level of chern classes , and in arbitrary dimension . the configuration of two smooth surfaces mentioned above does not appear to generalize in the same fashion .",
