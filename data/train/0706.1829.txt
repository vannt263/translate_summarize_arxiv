    "scale invariance is broken explicitly in the standard model by the @xmath0 higgs parameter . eliminating this parameter results in a classically scale - invariant theory .",
    "however scale invariance is anomalous : it is broken radiatively , as first studied by coleman and weinberg  @xcite .",
    "their analysis shows that for a minimal scalar sector consisting of a single higgs doublet , the scale - invariant potential fails to produce spontaneous symmetry breaking for a top quark in excess of about 40 gev  @xcite .",
    "the more general case with multiple scalars is therefore of interest .",
    "a suitable perturbative framework for analysing the general case was discussed by gildener and weinberg  @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is quite straightforward to build phenomenologically consistent models of electroweak symmetry breaking in scale - invariant models with multiple scalar fields  @xcite .",
    "there are obvious advantages of such scale - invariant theories over the usual standard model .",
    "in particular , they provide an elegant solution to the hierarchy problem since the electroweak scale is then naturally stabilised with respect to radiative corrections .",
    "scale invariance also forbids higher - dimensional operators , such as the dimension - six baryon number violating interactions and the like , which , from the standard model point of view could exist but would spoil the renormalisability of the theory . in other words ,",
    "scale - invariant theories provide a symmetry reason for the non - existence of troublesome higher - dimensional terms , which is quite different from the standard argument of imposing renormalisability .    an important remaining issue , though , is what to do about gravity , which of course also involves a scale , the planck mass .",
    "it is tempting to apply scale invariance to the whole fundamental theory , including gravity  @xcite , by , for example , generating the planck mass from the vacuum expectation value of a scalar field  @xcite . for the purposes of this paper , however , we shall set the gravity question to one side , and solve the neutrino problem first",
    ".    there is now extremely strong evidence that neutrinos oscillate due to nonzero masses and mixings .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to address the important issue of how neutrino mass can be generated in classically scale - invariant theories .",
    "we investigate mechanisms which generate neutrino masses at tree - level and others which generate it radiatively .",
    "we find that the usual mechanisms for generating neutrino masses have scale invariant incarnates .",
    "however only the models which generate neutrino mass radiatively motivate the observed suppression of the neutrino mass scale relative to the electroweak scale .",
    "we also find that the introduction of neutrino mass in scale invariant models generates an accidental symmetry . in the simplest models which induce neutrino mass and produce a pseudo - goldstone boson ( pgb ) electroweak higgs , a real gauge singlet scalar field",
    "is required and the resulting symmetry is discrete . promoting",
    "the singlet scalar to a complex field extends the discrete symmetry to the continuous lepton number symmetry .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we review the realisation of the electroweak higgs as the pgb of anomalous scale invariance .",
    "the generation of neutrino mass at tree level is considered in section  [ sec3 ] and in section  [ sec4 ] radiatively induced neutrino masses are studied .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec5 ] .",
    "the simplest phenomenologically consistent scale invariant model @xcite involves the addition of one real scalar field , @xmath1 , to the minimal standard model ( sm ) . here",
    "we review the model to provide the necessary framework for the subsequent discussions .",
    "the most general renormalisable scale - invariant potential is @xmath2 where @xmath3 under @xmath4 is the sm scalar doublet .",

    "we parameterise the fields in unitary gauge through @xmath7 the potential ( [ a1 ] ) is then @xmath8 this tree - level potential receives quantal corrections as per the coleman - weinberg analysis .",
    "we shall work in the parameter regime where the one - loop perturbative correction @xmath9 is sufficiently accurate .",
    "ideally , one would like to directly minimise the corrected potential @xmath10 , but this is impossible to do analytically .",
    "we instead follow the approximate procedure introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite which is valid in our weakly - coupled theory .",
    "the idea is to first ignore the radiative corrections and minimise the tree - level potential ( [ a3 ] ) . with @xmath11 but arbitrary , there are two interesting cases ( ignoring a third case that has no electroweak symmetry breaking ) .    for @xmath12 ,",
    "@xmath13 with @xmath14 and only the electroweak higgs develops a nonzero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) . the scale @xmath15 is the renormalisation point where @xmath16 vanishes , anticipating the addition of radiative corrections .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath16 transmutes into the scale @xmath15 in the quantised theory .",
    "this is a manifestation of the scale anomaly of quantum field theory and it generates dimensionful quantities such as masses despite the classical scale invariance .    for @xmath17 ,",
    "@xmath18 with @xmath19 where @xmath20 . once again , the required relation between the higgs potential parameters serves to define the renormalisation point , and a dimensionless parameter is transmuted into the scale @xmath15 . in this case",

    "variations of this accidental symmetry generically occur in all the models considered in this paper .",
    "the accidental @xmath6 symmetry would be violated by interactions in the scalar potential involving odd powers of the singlet field @xmath1 .",
    "however classical scale invariance permits only quartic terms in the scalar potential , hence one can always extend the discrete @xmath5 of section  [ sec2 ] to include non - singlet scalars .",
    "this symmetry appears to be a discrete subgroup of the continuous lepton number symmetry , and remains a classical symmetry of the theory .",
    "spontaneous breaking of this discrete symmetry with @xmath63 leads to a potential cosmological domain wall problem .",
    "the standard solution is provided by inflation with a reheating temperature lower than the order parameter ( @xmath64 ) of the phase transition during which the walls are produced .",
    "note also that the accidental symmetries in the models considered here are anomalous and thus the domain walls are not strictly stable @xcite . we expect that electroweak instantons and sphalerons ( at high temperatures ) will contribute to the decay of the domain walls .",
    "a detailed study of these issues is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "neutrino mass can also be generated by including an electroweak triplet higgs . in this case",
    "@xmath46 is not required and neutrino masses are generated from the lagrangian term @xmath65 here @xmath66 transforms like @xmath67 under @xmath68 and @xmath69 . a small vev for the electrically neutral component @xmath70 generates a tree - level majorana mass for @xmath71 .    the simplest phenomenologically - consistent scale - invariant potential which can give @xmath72 requires @xmath73 , @xmath74 and the real gauge singlet scalar field , @xmath1 . and",

    "we find that the physical scalar spectrum consists of an approximately degenerate complex @xmath87 triplet , a massive singlet @xmath88 , and a massless state @xmath89 ( this is the pgb which will gain mass at one - loop level ) , where @xmath90 observe that there is no pseudo goldstone boson associated with lepton number violation .",
    "this is because lepton number is explicitly broken and in the limit where the explicit lepton number violating term ( @xmath91 ) vanishes our parameter choice is such that lepton number is _ not _ spontaneously broken",
    ".    the pgb state , @xmath24 , is massless at tree - level due to the presence of a flat direction in the potential .",
    "this flat direction receives one - loop corrections , leading to spontaneous symmetry breaking as long as the bosonic degrees of freedom dominate over the top quark contribution . as in the previous section ,",
    "we end up with a relation between the pgb mass , @xmath44 , and the masses of the heavier scalars : @xmath92.\\label{delta_mass_relation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that in this case the pgb need not mainly ` reside ' in the electroweak doublet if @xmath93 .",
    "generating neutrino masses at tree - level is one interesting possibility . recall that both of the models considered in section  [ sec3 ] involved small parameters ; the model with gauge singlet fermions required @xmath94 , whilst the model with a triplet higgs required @xmath77 similarly small .",
    "these hierarchies are a manifestation of the radiative breaking of scale invariance and may be understood as follows .",
    "models which are classically scale invariant possess no dimensional quantities in the lagrangian .",
    "if scale invariance is broken radiatively dimensional transmutation occurs and a mass scale is introduced into the theory . identifying this with the electroweak scale",
    "means that additional mass scales are only present in the model if one introduces hierarchies amongst the dimensionless parameters .",
    "if neutrinos acquire mass at tree level such parameter hierarchies are necessary .",
    "an alternative possibility is to generate neutrino masses radiatively . in this case",
    "the dimensionful parameter introduced via dimensional transmutation is only communicated to the neutrino sector by higher order processes .",
    "this renders radiatively induced neutrino masses more appealing from a theoretical point of view in models with anomalous scale - invariance . in what follows",
    "we briefly consider the simplest one - loop models , but save a more detailed analysis for the two - loop case which has the simplest higgs potential .",
    "the zee model @xcite is obtained by adding the scalar fields @xmath95 to the sm ( without right - handed neutrinos ) .",
    "these scalars couple to the leptons via : @xmath96 where as before , @xmath97 and generation indices are suppressed .    enforcing scale invariance permits the electroweak higgs to be a pgb .",
    "however neutrino masses are not generated as scale invariance forbids the lepton number violating term @xmath98 in the potential , ensuring that the complete scale - invariant lagrangian conserves lepton number . if one includes the real gauge - singlet scalar @xmath1 then the electroweak higgs remains as a pgb and the scalar potential contains the lepton number violating term @xmath99 thus provided that @xmath100 , neutrinos acquire mass through the one - loop diagram in figure  [ fig : zee_diagram ] neutrinos acquire mass through a three - loop diagram .",
