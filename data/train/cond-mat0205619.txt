    "granular materials present a rich and intriguing phenomenology , which has attracted the interest of the scientific community since the nineteenth century @xcite . however , in spite of its recent progress the theoretical study of granular gases , i.e. of fluidized granular particles , is certainly less advanced than that concerning ordinary molecular fluids .",
    "the reason for this state of affairs is the presence of dissipation due to inelastic collisions and of friction with the surroundings , which prevents these system to reach thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "in fact , in order to render stationary a granular system one needs to inject continuously energy into the system .",
    "this can be done , for instance by shaking or vibrating the grains .    in the present paper",
    "we illustrate the results of a numerical investigation concerning the properties of a two component granular mixture , modeled , following an established tradition , by inelastic hard spheres ( ihs ) with different masses , restitution coefficients , radii , and subject to different forms of external drive .",
    "the physical motivation for our study stems from the fact that in nature most granular materials are polydisperse from the point of view of their sizes and/or of their physical and mechanical properties .",
    "the theoretical study of granular mixtures has attracted so far the attention of several researchers@xcite .",
    "these studies comprehend both freely cooling and uniformly heated granular mixtures and have been performed almost contemporaneously with laboratory experiments @xcite .",
    "the most striking outcome is the lack of energy equipartition , i.e. the presence of two different kinetic temperatures , one for each species .    in the present paper",
    "our interest will be concentrated on the stationary state obtained by applying an energy feeding mechanism , represented by a uniform stochastic driving force or by a vibrating wall . in the first case",
    "the work of barrat and trizac @xcite and garz et al .",
    "@xcite provides a simple theoretical account , based on the boltzmann equation approach and on the direct simulation monte carlo method ( dsmc ) @xcite , of the lack of energy equipartition .",
    "the present work differs from the recently appeared papers dealing with granular mixtures in several aspects :    * the heat bath , which drives the system , is at finite temperature , since we have introduced a finite friction of the particles with the surroundings and we have considered the possibility of having spatially inhomogeneous states ; * in addition , we considered a second situation in which the particles subject to a vertical gravitational field receive energy anisotropically from the bottom vibrating wall of the container ; * in both cases we provide information about the presence of inhomogeneities in the system , e.g. density clustering and non - uniform density and temperature profiles .    in sec .",
    "ii we present the model fluid and two different mechanisms of energy supply . in sect iii",
    "we discuss the first sub - model , the one with the heat bath , and obtain by means of an approximate analytic method an estimate of the partial temperature of each component .",
    "subsequently we study the same sub - model with a dsmc algorithm . in sect .",
    "iv we study numerically the second sub - model ( the one with gravity and vibrating wall ) by means of dsmc simulations .",
    "finally in the last section , v , we present our conclusions .",
    "we shall consider a dilute inelastic gas constituted of @xmath0 particles of mass @xmath1 and @xmath2 particles of mass @xmath3 subject to some kind of external driving ( this will be specified in the following ) .",
    "we suppose that the interactions between the grains can be described by the smooth inelastic hard sphere model ( ihs ) @xcite , thus we specify only the radius of the spheres , their masses and the fraction of the kinetic energy dissipated at each collision .",
    "this can be done by defining three different restitution coefficients @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , which account for normal dissipation in collisions among particles of type @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "no internal degrees of freedom ( e.g. rotations ) are included .",
    "one can describe the velocity changes induced by the instantaneous inelastic collisions of smooth disks labeled @xmath9 and @xmath10 of diameter @xmath11 and @xmath12 by the following equations :    @xmath13    [ collision ]    where @xmath14 is the unit vector along the line of centers @xmath15 and @xmath16 of the colliding disks at contact and @xmath17 are the species ( @xmath9 or @xmath10 ) to whom particles @xmath9 and @xmath10 belong .",
    "an elementary collision conserves the total momentum and reduces the relative kinetic energy by an amount proportional to @xmath18 .",
    "the collision rule we have adopted excludes the presence of tangential forces , and hence the rotational degrees of freedom do not contribute to the description of the dynamics .",
    "since the particles suffer mutual collisions and loose kinetic energy , in order to achieve a steady state , one needs to supply from the exterior some energy .",
    "the energy source has been modeled in two different fashions .    in the first sub - model we have assumed that the particles , besides suffering mutual collisions experience a uniform stochastic force and a viscous damping@xcite .",
    "the presence of the frictional , velocity - dependent term in addition to the random forcing , not only is motivated by the idea of preventing the energy of a driven elastic system ( @xmath19 ) , to increase indefinitely , but also mimics the presence of friction of the particles with the container .",
    "moreover a fluctuation dissipation relation is assumed between the viscous force and the intensity of the noise . even in extended systems with small",
    "inelasticity the absence of friction may cause some problems of stability  @xcite",
    ". we shall be mainly interested in the stationary situation determined by the balance between the energy feeding mechanism and the dissipative forces due both to the inelasticity of the collisions and to the velocity - dependent frictional force .    in the second sub - model the grains",
    "are constrained to move on a frictionless inclined plane and the bottom boundary vibrates ( as a thermal  @xcite or deterministic  @xcite oscillating wall ) giving energy only to the particles bouncing on it .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are assumed laterally .",
    "since we consider throughout only sufficiently low density systems successive binary collisions are effectively uncorrelated and boltzmann equation can be used to describe the non equilibrium dynamics .",
    "in fact , by assuming the validity of the boltzmann molecular chaos hypothesis , introduced to treat the collision term , it is straightforward to derive the governing equations for the probability density distribution function of each species .",
    "moreover in this situation we are allowed to perform direct simulation monte carlo to integrate numerically the inhomogeneous boltzmann equation of the sub - models .",
    "in order to see the effect of the heat bath let us consider the system in the absence of collisions . in this case , the evolution of the velocity of each particle is described by an ornstein - uhlenbeck process .",
    "if we require that the two components must reach the same granular temperature in the limit of vanishing inelasticity we have two different possibilities to fix the heat bath parameters :    @xmath20    [ riclangevin ] @xmath21    where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the heat bath temperature and @xmath24 is a gaussian noise with the following properties :    @xmath25    the associated fokker - planck equations for the two cases are respectively :    @xmath26    [ bagni ]      when we take into account collisions among particles equations   become two coupled boltzmann equations modified by the presence of a diffusion term due to the thermal noise .",
    "we shall first consider a spatially homogeneous case in order to derive the temperature of each species in the homogeneous stationary state .",
    "this represents a sort of mean field approximation .",
    "in fact , in the original boltzmann equations the collisions are considered to occur only between particles at the same spatial location , whereas here these can occur between arbitrary pairs of particles regardless their spatial separation . in the present subsection we compute the second moments , @xmath27 , of the distribution functions in order to determine the partial temperatures and their ratio . although the method of derivation of the equations for the partial temperatures is not original , we present it in order to render the paper self - contained and because it shows the differences between the particular heat bath we employed and those chosen by other authors  @xcite . first ,",
    "indicating by @xmath28 the partial density of species @xmath7 , we notice that both eqs .",
    "possess the same equilibrium solution :    @xmath29    although the relaxation properties are different . only upon adding the inelastic collision term the two species display different temperatures .",
    "the resulting boltzmann equation for a granular mixture is @xcite :    @xmath30 + \\frac{\\xi_{0i}^2}{2}\\nabla^2_v f_i+\\beta_i\\nabla_v\\cdot(\\mathbf{v}_1 f_i)\\ ] ]    where we have used a compact notation to represent the two different choices of heat bath :    * * case 1 * + @xmath31 * * case 2 * + @xmath32    and @xmath33 $ ] is the collision integral :    @xmath34\\equiv \\sigma_{ij}^2 \\int d\\mathbf{v}_2 \\int d\\mathbf{\\hat{\\sigma } } \\theta(\\hat{\\sigma }   \\cdot \\mathbf{g}_{12 } ) ( \\hat{\\sigma } \\cdot \\mathbf{g}_{12 } ) [ \\alpha_{ij}^{-2 } f_i(\\mathbf{v_1^\\prime})f_j(\\mathbf{v_2^\\prime})-f_i(\\mathbf{v_1})f_j(\\mathbf{v_2})]\\ ] ]    the primed velocities are pre - collisional states , which can be obtained by inverting eqs .",

    "the experimental observation  @xcite suggest that the trend of case 2 is the right one .",
    "in other words , in the case 2 both the friction term and the power supplied are proportional to the mass of the two species and such a property is probably true also in the experiments .",
    "this is why we shall use the recipe of case 2 in the following dsmc simulations .     vs. @xmath48",

    "moreover in this approximation the diameter @xmath59 is no more explicitly relevant , but it is directly related to the choices of @xmath60 and @xmath58 in a non trivial way : in fact the bird algorithm allows the particles to pass through each other , so that a rigorous diameter can not be defined or simply estimated as a function of @xmath60 and @xmath58 . in this section , to indicate the degree of damping , we give the time @xmath61 instead of @xmath62 .",
