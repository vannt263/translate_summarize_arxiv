    "using three - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations and subsequent radiative transfer calculations , we determine the respective line fluxes for two explosion models  a violent merger of two wds with a sub - chandrasekhar mass primary , and a delayed detonation in a near - chandrasekhar mass wd .",
    "for the latter , we use the n100 model from @xcite . for the violent merger of two wds ( 1.1 and 0.9@xmath3 ) ,",
    "we use the model published in @xcite .",
    "these two explosion models have been shown to reproduce many of the observable characteristics of `` normal '' sne  ia @xcite and are representatives of the single degenerate and double degenerate evolutionary channels , respectively .",
    "details of the simulation techniques can be found in the original publications and references therein .",
    "we have chosen these two explosion models as illustrative examples that highlight the dependence of the @xmath2 yield on the explosion scenario and primary wd mass .",
    "both models employ a fully three - dimensional treatment of the explosion hydrodynamics , which , compared to lower dimensional models , establishes a more realistic description of the distribution of the radioactive isotopes in the ejecta and enables radiative transfer calculations for different lines of sight .",
    "we consider the use of three - dimensional models important for this problem for the following reason : driven by buoyancy forces , hot and less dense ashes of the nuclear burning  float towards the surface \" , that is , they travel in mass coordinate against the gravitational field lines , their places filled by unburned material from down - drafts .",
    "this physical behaviour is present in our 3d model but is completely absent in 1d models , where the symmetry constraint makes convective motion impossible and forces the burning products to an artificial  onion - like `` shell structure ( where they remain layered in the same order they were burned ) .",
    "this leads to differences in the location of important isotopes : for example , comparing the mass distribution of the n100 @xcite and say w7 @xcite models , we see that the mn ( coming from @xmath17 ) , predominantly arising from ' ' normal \" freeze - out from nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) , sits in qualitatively different positions , that is , centrally concentrated at low velocity in the w7 and roughly speaking in a spherical shell at intermediate velocities in our 3d models .",
    "we then use the results of the radiative transfer calculations as input for x - ray telescope signal simulations and investigate the prospects for distinguishing the explosion models for several current and proposed x - ray astronomy missions .    for explosive nucleosynthesis conditions occurring in sne  ia , only a small fraction of the @xmath2 ( @xmath22 ) that is present in the ejecta a few weeks after the explosion was produced as `` primary '' @xmath2 .",

    "a recent study has shown that the @xmath17 to @xmath13 production ratio is rather insensitive to nuclear reaction rate uncertainties @xcite .",

    "in addition to the expected signal from the sn  ia x - ray line emission , we consider the instrumental background and x - ray continuum contributions .",
    "there are several potential mechanisms that could produce x - ray continuum emission at kev energies .",
    "first , there is the bremsstrahlung of fast recoil electrons that scatter from ions during their deceleration to thermal energies within the sn interior @xcite . these recoil",
    "electrons are produced in compton - scattering events with the primary gamma - ray photons of the radioactive isotopes in the ejecta .",
    "the x - ray flux due to this mechanism is most intense in the first few weeks after the explosion when the radioactive energy deposition of @xmath13 and @xmath14 decay in the expanding sn is still large and the production of fast electrons near the surface is efficient because the compton optical depth remains high .",
    "this changes at later times when the ejecta become fully transparent to gamma rays and the production of fast electrons is no longer efficient .",
    "an extrapolation of the results of @xcite for the w7 model shows that the internal bremsstrahlung contribution can be completely neglected at the epochs relevant for this work .",
    "second , there may be x - ray emission arising from the interaction of the ejecta with the surrounding circumstellar medium ( csm ) .",
    "both thermal and non - thermal emission mechanisms can contribute . since the x - ray emission of shell - type sn remnants usually shows a dominant contribution of thermal emission processes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we approximate the continuum emission with a thermal bremsstrahlung model .",
    "models assuming typical densities for the ambient medium predict that the thermal x - ray emission from the heated ejecta and ambient material does not reach its maximum luminosity until several hundred years after explosion @xcite . in agreement with such models ,",
    "observations generally place only upper limits of the early thermal x - ray emission of sne  ia ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the intensity of the x - ray emission from csm interaction depends on the strengths of the forward and reverse shocks that build up after the ejecta are launched .",
    "although initially weak , the x - ray radiation in the shocked regions increases as more heated and compressed material is accumulated . to take the effects of csm interaction into account , we adopt an analytic model of the underlying x - ray continuum emission @xcite .",
    "for the thermal bremsstrahlung , we use @xmath59 ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the normalisation of the bremsstrahlung emission is given by the emission measure @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the volume of the shocked and emitting material , @xmath62 the electron density and @xmath63 the ion density .",
    "assuming a constant - density ambient medium with @xmath64 , which is a typical number in most of the galaxy and the magellanic clouds , hydrodynamical simulations of the shock interactions result in typical emission measures of @xmath65 to @xmath66 at six years after the explosion ( cf .",
    "these assumptions concerning the ambient medium and the emission measure are further justified by the fact that only a rare subclass of sne ia shows indications for a strong interaction with their csm @xcite . for this work ,",
    "we perform all calculations assuming an emission measure of @xmath65 .",
    "we absorb the emission line and the thermal bremsstrahlung component by a galactic neutral hydrogen column ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of @xmath67 .",
    "this value corresponds to the viewing direction of m101 @xcite and is typical for an observation that does not point towards the galactic disk .",
    "however , at the line energy of 5.9 kev , absorption effects are negligible for column densities below @xmath68 and our results therefore do not depend on the exact value of @xmath69 .",
    "next , we estimate the detectability of the 5.9kev emission line , which we assume to be monochromatic for the purpose of this excercise . the detection significance @xmath70 is given by @xmath71 with the source count rate @xmath72 , the background count rate @xmath73 , and the exposure time @xmath74 @xcite .",

    "the quantitative statements we make about the detectability of sne  ia are of course model dependent .",
    "in particular , the assumed metallicity of the zero - age main sequence ( zams ) progenitor has a direct effect on the production of the slightly neutron rich radionuclides @xmath17 and @xmath2 ( see table  [ tab:1 ] ) .",
    "the metallicity dependent yields for the n100 model are taken from @xcite , who approximately take the effect of zams metallicity into account by making the simplyfing assumption that all metals in the zams progenitor are locked up in cno , which is efficiently converted to @xmath87 during h - burning and then to @xmath88 during core he - burning . for the merger case , we use the yields from the 1.1 + 0.9 @xmath3  model from @xcite , which treated zams metallicity in the same way . for the merger model ,",
    "the effect of the assumed zams metallicity on mn is quite pronounced , resulting in a strong suppression ( by more than an order of magnitude ) in the combined mass of @xmath17 and @xmath2 when going from solar to 0.01 times solar metallicity ( note that sne  ia from progenitors with such low zams metallicity should be rare in the local universe based on their predicted age from theoretical delay - time distributions ) .",
    "in contrast , the delayed - detonation model based on the explosion of a near - chandrasekhar mass wd exhibits only a modest reduction of less than a factor of two with decreasing zams progenitor metallicity from solar to 0.01 times solar . this qualitatively different dependence on progenitor metallicity is explained by the different nucleosynthetic processes operating .",
    "the high - density regions of the near - chandrasekhar mass delayed - detonation model undergo significant in - situ neutronisation via electron capture processes , which explains the relatively flat dependence on pre - explosion neutron enrichment .",
    "on the other hand , the much lower peak densities of the significantly sub - chandrasekhar mass wds in the merger model prohibit significant neutron enrichment via in - situ electron captures , which explains the comparatively steep dependence on pre - explosion neutron enrichment and hence metallicity .",
    "but even if the variations in the abundances of @xmath17 and @xmath2 in dependence on the progenitor metallicities as given in table  [ tab:1 ] are taken into consideration , the differences between the two models still amount to at least a factor of two .",
    "in other words , the dimmest of our delayed - detonation models will still be more than a factor of two brighter than the brightest of our violent - merger models . in this context",
    "we point out that the mn yields are also rather robust across many near - chandrasekhar mass explosion models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )  the variance between the different models is comparable to the variance introduced by metallicity .",
    "furthermore , we note that in case of a specific nearby sn ia , explosion models would be adjusted in order to reproduce the event as accurately as possible .",
    "this includes assumptions concerning the metallicity of the progenitor system that may be constrained by information about the environment of the respective host galaxy .",

    "even if the emission measure was enhanced due to higher csm densities or additional non - thermal processes , the detectability of the line would remain qualitatively unaffected in case of the major part of normal sne that do not show strong csm interaction at early times ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "changes in the doppler broadening result in slightly larger error bars for the determination of the line flux in case of higher velocities .",
    "therefore , the 5.9kev emission line can be regarded as a unique distinctive feature for the two introduced explosion scenarios , independent of the choice of a specific parameter set .",

    "<S> we show that the x - ray line flux of the mn k@xmath0 line at @xmath1 from the decay of @xmath2 is a promising diagnostic to distinguish between type ia supernova ( sn ia ) explosion models . using radiation transport calculations , </S>",
    "<S> we compute the line flux for two three - dimensional explosion models : a near - chandrasekhar mass delayed detonation and a violent merger of two ( 1.1 and 0.9 @xmath3 ) white dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> both models are based on solar metallicity zero - age main sequence progenitors . due to explosive nuclear burning at higher density , </S>",
    "<S> the delayed - detonation model synthesises @xmath4 times more radioactive @xmath2 than the merger model . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the peak mn k@xmath0 line flux of the delayed - detonation model exceeds that of the merger model by a factor of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> since in both models the @xmath1 x - ray flux peaks five to six years after the explosion , a single measurement of the x - ray line emission at this time can place a constraint on the explosion physics that is complementary to those derived from earlier phase optical spectra or light curves . </S>",

    "<S> a line detection is feasible with chandra up to @xmath8 for an exposure time of @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that it should be possible with currently existing x - ray instruments ( with exposure times ) to detect both of our models at sufficiently high s / n to distinguish between them for hypothetical events within the local group . </S>",
