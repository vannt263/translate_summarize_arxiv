    "the electromagnetic interaction is of the local nature , e.g. the interaction hamiltonian in quantum electrodynamics is @xmath1 i.e. the current in a point @xmath2 interacts with an electromagnetic field @xmath3 in the same point .",
    "however the process of photon radiation takes place not in one point but in some domain of space - time , in which a photon ( an emitted wave in the classical language ) is originating . the longitudinal dimension of this domain is called _ the formation ( coherence ) length_. it is evident that the minimal size of the formation length is the wave length of the emitted photon .",
    "one can estimate the formation length from the phase factor entering the expression for the probability of photon emission . in the quasiclassical operator method ( see eq.([a1 ] ) , appendix a ) this factor is ( in this paper we employ units such that @xmath4 ) @xmath5 , \\label{2}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the energy of the initial ( final ) electron , @xmath7 is the photon energy , @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the wave vector of the photon , @xmath10 is the particle location on a classical trajectory , @xmath11 is the time .",
    "the main contribution into the integral over time in the general expression for the probability of radiation ( [ a1 ] ) gives the region @xmath12 taking into account that @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the dielectric constant , @xmath15 is the plasma frequency , @xmath16 is the electron density , we have from eq.([3 ] ) for @xmath17 @xmath18 in this paper we consider the processes at high energies , i.e. the lorentz factor @xmath19 . then from eq.([5 ] ) follows :    1 .",
    "ultrarelativistic particle radiates into the narrow cone with the vertex angle @xmath20 along the momentum of the initial particle , the contribution of larger angles is suppressed because of shortening of the formation length ; 2 .",
    "the effect of the polarization of a medium described by the dielectric constant @xmath14 manifest itself for soft photons only when @xmath21 , since on the earth @xmath22  ev we have @xmath23 ; 3 .",
    "when @xmath24 the formation length is of the order @xmath25    in the classical case @xmath26 one has @xmath27 .",
    "so for ultrarelativistic particles the formation length extends substantially .",
    "for example for a @xmath28  gev electron emitting a @xmath29  mev photon , @xmath30 m , i.e.@xmath31 interatomic distances .",
    "the formation length is important in many electromagnetic processes including creation of electron - positron pair , magnetic bremsstrahlung , transition radiation , @xmath32erenkov radiation .",
    "there is also a set of applications involving other forces .",
    "there is a number of physical interpretation of the formation length .",
    "* the momentum transfer @xmath33 to a nucleus in the process of the photon emission by the particle with the momentum @xmath34 @xmath35 takes the minimal value when it is longitudinal @xmath36 , and in this case @xmath37 , i.e. from the uncertainty principle follows that if the minimal momentum transfer is small , then the formation length is large . * for creation of the electron - positron pair",
    "the formation length is the distance required for the final state particles to separate enough that they act as independent particles .",
    "* this is the distance over which the amplitudes of several interactions can add coherently to the total probability . * the transverse size of the region , where the radiation is formed @xmath38 is determined by the minimal transverse momentum transfer @xmath39 : @xmath40 .",
    "although usually @xmath41 and this dimension is much smaller , we consider below the situation when the constraint of @xmath42 is the main effect .    the formation length concept is important because within it the amplitudes can add coherently if a charged particle is moving freely . in the opposite case , when some perturbation is acting on the particle within the formation length , breakdown of the coherence happens and radiation will be suppressed .",
    "landau and pomeranchuk were the first to show that if the formation length of the bremsstrahlung becomes comparable to the distance over which the multiple scattering becomes important , the bremsstrahlung will be suppressed @xcite .",
    "they considered radiation of soft photons .",
    "migdal @xcite , @xcite developed a quantitative theory of this phenomenon .",

    "let us estimate a disturbance of the emission process due to a multiple scattering . as it is known , the mean angle of the multiple scattering at some length @xmath43 is @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the radiation length .",
    "since we are interesting in influence of the multiple scattering on the radiation process we put here the formation length ( [ 6 ] ) .",
    "one can expect that when @xmath47 this influence will be substantial .",
    "from this inequality we have @xmath48 here @xmath49 is the characteristic energy scale , for which the multiple scattering will influence the radiation process for the whole spectrum .",
    "it was introduced in @xcite and denoted by @xmath50 .",
    "for tungsten we have @xmath51  tev , and similar values for all the heavy elements . for the light elements the energy @xmath49 is much larger .",
    "when @xmath52 the multiple scattering will influence emission of soft photons only with energy @xmath53 e.g. for particles with energy @xmath28  gev one has @xmath54  mev .",
    "of course , we estimate here the criterion only . for description of the effect one has to calculate the probability of the bremsstrahlung taking into account multiple scattering .",
    "side by side with the multiple scattering of an emitting electron one has to take into account also the influence of the medium on the radiated electromagnetic field . as it was shown above eq.([5 ] ) , this effect leads also to suppression of the soft photon emission ( the dielectric suppression , the ter - mikaelian effect , see in @xcite ) .",
    "a clear qualitative analysis of different mechanisms of suppression is presented in early papers @xcite,@xcite .",
    "more simple derivation of the migdal s results is given in @xcite .",
    "the next step in a quantitative theory of the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect was made in @xcite .",
    "this theory is based on the quasiclassical operator method in qed developed by the authors ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "one of the basic equations ( obtained with the use of kinetic equations describing the motion of an electron in the medium in the presence of an external field ) is the schrdinger equation in an external field with imaginary potential ( eq.(3.3 ) of @xcite ; see ( [ a21 ] ) in appendix a ) .",
    "new activity with the theory of the lpm effect is connected with a very successful series of experiments @xcite - @xcite performed at slac recently . in these experiments",
    "the cross section of the bremsstrahlung of soft photons with energy from 200  kev to 500  mev from electrons with energy 8  gev and 25  gev was measured for a variety in materials with an accuracy of the order of a few percent .",
    "both the lpm and the dielectric suppression was observed and investigated .",
    "these experiments were the challenge for the theory since in all the published before papers calculations are performed to logarithmic accuracy which is not enough for a description of the new experiments . the contribution of the coulomb corrections ( at least for heavy elements ) is larger then experimental errors and these corrections should be taken into account . in papers @xcite-@xcite",
    "the problem was investigated using different approaches .",
    "very recently the lpm was studied at cern @xcite using iridium target and electrons with energy 287  gev , 207  gev and 149  gev . for iridium according to eqs.([9 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] ) @xmath49=2.2 tev , @xmath55 37  gev for the highest energy and the lpm suppression of bremsstrahlung was observed in much wider interval of photon energies than at slac .",
    "the crossing process for the bremsstrahlung is the pair creation by a photon .",
    "the created particles in a medium can undergo the multiple scattering .",
    "it should be emphasized that for the bremsstrahlung the formation length ( [ 6 ] ) increases strongly if @xmath26 .",
    "just because of this the lpm effect was investigated at slac at a relatively low energy . for the pair creation",
    "the formation length @xmath56 attains maximum at @xmath57 and this maximum is @xmath58 . because of this even for heavy elements the effect of multiple scattering on pair creation becomes noticeable at photon energies @xmath59  tev @xcite . starting from these energies",
    "one has to take into account the influence of a medium on the pair creation and on the bremsstrahlung hard part of the spectrum in electromagnetic showers being created by the cosmic ray particles of the ultrahigh energies .",
    "these effects can be quite significant in the electromagnetic calorimeters operating in the detectors on the colliders in tev range .",
    "the nonlinear effects of qed are due to the interaction of a photon with electron - positron field .",
    "these processes are the photon - photon scattering , the coherent photon scattering , the photon splitting into two photons , and the coalescence of two photons into photon in the coulomb field .    the process of creation of the electron - positron pair by a photon connected with the coherent photon scattering @xcite . in the quasiclassical approximation",
    "the amplitude @xmath60 of the coherent photon scattering is described by diagram where the electron - positron pair is created by the initial photon with 4-momentum @xmath61 and then annihilate into the final photon with 4-momentum @xmath62 . for high energy photon",
    "@xmath63 this process occurs over a rather long distance , known as the time of life of the virtual state @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the characteristic transverse momentum of the process .",
    "when the virtual electron ( or positron ) is moving in a medium it scatters on atoms .",
    "the mean square of momentum transfer to the electron from a medium on the distance @xmath66 is @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the charge of nucleus , @xmath69 is the number density of atoms in the medium , @xmath70 is the photon momentum transfer ( @xmath71 ) , @xmath72 is the screening radius of atom .",
    "the coherent photon scattering amplitude @xmath60 can be obtained from general formulas for probabilities of electromagnetic processes in the frame of the quasiclassical operator method ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it can be estimated as @xmath73 we use the normalization condition im@xmath74 for the case @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the total cross section of pair creation by a photon .",
    "in the case of small momentum transfer @xmath77 we have in the region of small @xmath78 @xmath79    at an ultrahigh energy it is possible that @xmath80 . in this case the characteristic momentum transfer is @xmath81 , the combination @xmath82 enters in the formation length @xmath83 ( [ 5 ] ) .",
    "the self - consistency condition is @xmath84 where @xmath85 is defined in eq.([1.2 ] ) . so using eq.([1.3 ] )",
    "one gets for the estimate of the coherent photon scattering amplitude @xmath60 ( the influence of the multiple scattering manifests itself at the high photon energies such that @xmath86 ) @xmath87      the authors have shown @xcite that an external electromagnetic field can also modify the bremsstrahlung process .",
    "we consider the effect of an external field on the photon emission in electron - electron(positron ) collision .",
    "this effect is associated as well with a reduction of the formation length of a photon ( either real or virtual ) due to relatively large turn of particle velocity over this length , and the corresponding increase in the vertex angle of the radiation cone .",
    "if a photon of energy @xmath88 is emitted by an electron ( positron ) at an angle @xmath89 to its velocity , the formation length of such a photon will be according to eq.([5 ] ) ( we neglect the polarization of a medium ) @xmath90 where @xmath91 defined in eq.([1.5 ] ) .",
    "the characteristic emission angle in weak field is @xmath92 , and we can neglect the influence of the external field if @xmath93 substituting eq.([11 ] ) into eq.([12 ] ) , we have the criterion for a field to be weak @xmath94 here we introduced the important parameter @xmath95 , which characterizes the quantum effects in an external field , when @xmath96 we are in the classical domain and with @xmath97 we are already well inside the quantum domain @xmath98 where @xmath99 is an electric ( magnetic ) field , eq.([14 ] ) contains the transverse with respect to particle velocity @xmath100 component of fields , @xmath101 is one of @xmath102 in strong fields , where @xmath103 , with characteristic radiation angles @xmath104 , the effective emission angle @xmath105 is determined by a self - consistency argument : the deviation angle of the particle in the field over the formation length must not exceed @xmath106 , i.e. @xmath107 it can be seen from eq.([16 ] ) that when @xmath103 , neither the characteristic emission angle nor the photon formation length depends on the mass of the radiating particle .",
    "a parameter characterizing the effect of an external field on the radiation process was derived in @xcite .",
    "it follows from eq.([16 ] ) that , for @xmath108 , the characteristic photon formation length is reduced by factor @xmath109 , and the emission angle is increased by factor @xmath110 . since the relevant parameter @xmath111 depends on the frequency @xmath88 ( via @xmath112 ) , this effect is manifested earlier for soft photons . because of this a specific situation arises in bremsstrahlung in a collision of an electron and a positron(an electron ) in colliding - beam experiment .",
    "the point is that the external factors act differently on the radiating particle and on the recoil particle . for the radiating particle",
    "the criterion of influence of external factors is the same in scattering by a nucleus as in collision of particles . for the recoil particles the effect turns out to be enhanced by @xmath113 times ( in the laboratory frame )",
    "this is due to the fact that the main contribution to the bremsstrahlung cross section give the virtual photons emitted by recoil particle with very low energy @xmath114 where @xmath7 is the frequency of the real photon .",
    "the formation length of the virtual photon is @xmath115 for example , for @xmath116gev and @xmath117mev the formation length is enormous : @xmath118 cm .",
    "this is the reason why the field has a significant effect on virtual photon emission in @xmath119 collisions even for moderate field and at relatively low particle energies , when the parameter @xmath120 is small while the value @xmath121 is large . in that event ,",
    "the picture of emission of a bremsstrahlung photon ( radiation vertex ) does not change directly , but a significant change takes place in the virtual photon spectrum at momentum transfers @xmath122 , increasing the lower bound of the effective momentum transfer and resulting in a corresponding decrease of the cross section .",
    "the bremsstrahlung cross section under these conditions was derived to logarithmic accuracy in @xcite using the equivalent photon method . in @xcite",
    "the problem was solved to relativistic accuracy ( terms @xmath123 were neglected ) .",
    "it follows from eq.([13 ] ) , and was demonstrated in @xcite that in the case @xmath124 there is a change of the radiation vertex describing absorption of a virtual photon and emission of a real one . since for @xmath103",
    "the formation length of a real photon @xmath125 falls off as @xmath126 ( see eq.([16 ] ) ) , the bremsstrahlung cross section falls off in just the same extent .",

    "the calculations in the both papers @xcite and @xcite are more cumbersome and no general formulas for radiation spectra are obtained .",
