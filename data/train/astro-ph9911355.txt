    "two discoveries have recently opened new perspectives on the understanding dust evolution in the warm ionised medium ( wim ) .",

    "this study reveals a dust emissivity in the wim which does not differ much from that of the hi gas .",
    "however , the detection of infrared emission from dust in the wim is difficult because one can not easily separate the contribution of the h@xmath3 gas from that of the hi gas . for the first time",
    ", the wham h@xmath0 sky survey of our galaxy ( @xmath4 ) offers the unique opportunity to separate the dust emission associated with the diffuse h@xmath3 and hi gas .",
    "measuring and characterising the dust emission from the wim could allow to understand the evolution of the dust grains in the low - density gas .",
    "moreover , dust grain can play an important role in heating the diffuse ionised gas ( through the photoelectric effect , reynolds & cox , 1992 ) and can be responsible at least in part of forbidden line strengths ( sembach et al .",
    "1999 ; bland - hawthorn et al .",
    "+ dust emission associated with the hi gas has been extensively studied using the spatial correlation between the infrared dust emission and the 21 cm hi emission .",

    "( 1996 ) using dirbe and firas data together with the hi emission as measured by the leiden / dwingeloo survey of the northern hemisphere have found that the dust emission spectrum derived from this correlation can be quite well represented by a single modified planck curve characterized by t=17.5  k and @xmath5  @xmath6 .",
    "this emissivity law is very close to the one predicted by the draine @xmath7 lee ( 1984 ) dust model .",
    "+ studies of the far - infrared emission at high galactic latitude have also revealed a residual component interpreted as the cosmic far - infrared background ( puget et al .",
    "1996 ; fixsen et al . 1998 ; hauser et al . 1998 ; lagache et al .",
    "this background is produced by the line of sight accumulation of all extragalactic objects that are not resolved in the firas or dirbe beam .",

    "we then present the results ( sect .",
    "finally , a summary is given in sect .",
    "we have used far - infared data from the dirbe and firas instruments on board the cobe satellite .",
    "the firas instrument is a polarising michelson interferometer with @xmath9 resolution and two separate bands ( from 2.2 to 20  @xmath10 and from 20 to 96 @xmath10 ) which have a fixed spectral resolution of 0.57  @xmath10 ( fixsen et al .",
    "the study presented here is based on `` pass 4 '' data which have been corrected for the zodiacal light ( kelsall et al .",
    "1998 ) , the cosmic microwave background and its dipole emission ( see the firas explanatory supplement ) .",
    "dirbe is a photometer with ten bands covering the range from 1.25 to 240@xmath11 with 40 arcmin resolution ( silverberg et al .",
    "we only use the last three bands ( 100 , 140 and 240 @xmath1 m ) for which the zodiacal emission has been subtracted .",
    "these maps are called `` zodi - subtracted mission average maps '' .",
    "+ we decide in our analysis to work at the firas resolution ( 1 ) to increase the dirbe map signal to noise ratio and ( 2 ) to combine firas and dirbe data .",
    "thus , we convolve the dirbe maps with the firas point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "the psf is not precisely known for all wavelengths , so we use the approximation suggested by mather ( private communication ) of a @xmath9 diameter circle convolved with a line of @xmath12 length perpendicular to the ecliptic plane ( mather et al .",
    "+ the hi data we used are those of the leiden / dwingeloo survey which covers the entire sky down to @xmath13 with a grid spacing of 30 in both l and b. the 36 half power beam width of the dwingeloo 25  -  m telescope provides 21  -  cm maps at an angular resolution which closely matches that of the dirbe maps .",
    "details of the observations and correction procedures are given by hartmann ( 1994 ) and by hartmann @xmath7 burton ( 1997 ) .",
    "the 21cm - hi data are convolved with the firas psf .",
    "we derive the hi column densities using 1  k  km  s@xmath14=1.82  @xmath15  h  @xmath16 ( optically thin emission ) .",
    "+      the wham sky survey provides the first northern hemisphere , velocity - resolved map of h@xmath0 from our galaxy ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the wham instrument is a fabry - perot spectrometer which uses a low noise , high efficiency ccd camera as a detector behind a pair of 15 cm diameter fabry - perots .",
    "wham provides a 12 km s@xmath14 velocity resolution with one - degree angular resolution down to sensitivity limits of 0.2 r ( 1 r = 10@xmath17@xmath184@xmath19 ph @xmath16 s@xmath14",
    "sr@xmath14 ) in a 30 second exposure .",
    "the one - degree angular resolution nicely matches the dirbe resolution and allows direct comparison between these two datasets .",
    "we have used two parts of the wham survey centred on ( l , b)=(148@xmath20 , -20@xmath20 ) and ( l , b)=(138@xmath20 , 36@xmath20 ) .",
    "the two maps ( 40@xmath20@xmath2150@xmath20 and 60@xmath20@xmath2120@xmath20 respectively ) are called map1 and map2 . for these two regions ,",
    "preliminary data reduction has been done including bias subtraction , reflected ring subtraction , annular - summing and flat - fielding .",
    "the geocoronal h@xmath0 line is easily removed due to the velocity separation between this atmospheric emission line and the galactic emission line .",
    "a first - order polynomial fits the sky background well within the wham 200  km  s@xmath14 bandpass",
    ". the typical level of the subtracted background is about 0.03 - 0.07  r ( km s@xmath14)@xmath14 .",
    "some spectra in the direction of stars brighter than the sixth magnitude contain the h@xmath0 absorption line from the star .",
    "these pointings appear as isolated 1@xmath20 diameter depression in the otherwise smooth emission at high galactic latitude .",
    "intensity calibration is performed using frequent observations of nebular sources .",
    "all wham intensities are tied to the absolute intensity measurement of the north american nebula ( ngc 7000 ) .",
    "the uncertainty on the h@xmath0 emission for this preliminary dataset is about 10@xmath2 .",
    "details on wham can be found in tufte ( 1997 ) , haffner ( 1999 ) and reynolds et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . + for comparison with cobe data , wham data have been first projected on the dirbe sixcube . a 5@xmath215 pixel median",
    "filtering has been applied in order to remove the defects induced by stellar h@xmath0 absorption lines from several lines of sight .",
    "these data are then convolved with the firas beam .",
    "the decomposition of the far - infrared emission in very diffuse regions requires careful selection of pixels on the sky mainly to avoid hii regions and ir emission from molecular clouds .",
    "we apply several criteria : + - we remove pixels with @xmath22 to avoid any contamination by residual zodiacal emission .",
    "+ - only high galactic latitude regions are selected ( b lower than -30@xmath20 and greater than 25@xmath20 for map1 and map2 respectively ) .",
    "+ - diffuse parts of the sky are selected following lagache et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . to remove molecular clouds and hii regions , we use the dirbe map of the 240  @xmath23 excess with respect to the 60@xmath23 emission : @xmath24s = s@xmath25(240)-  4@xmath21s@xmath25(60 ) .",
    "this map shows as positive flux regions , the cold component of the dust emission , and as negative flux regions , regions where the dust is locally heated by nearby stars ( like the hii regions ) .",
    "therefore , diffuse emission pixels are selected with @xmath26 , @xmath27 being evaluated from the width of the histogram of @xmath24s ( the distribution of @xmath24s is gaussian with a `` negative '' and `` positive '' wing corresponding to heated dust regions and cold molecular clouds respectively ) .",
    "this criteria is for example important for the map2 where it removes the cold polaris , ursa major and camelopardalis clouds .",
    "it removes 6.4@xmath2 of the original high ecliptic and galactic latitude maps .",
    "+ - we keep all regions for which the h@xmath28 emission is between 0.2 and 2  r. the lower value ( 0.2  r ) ensures that we are well above the noise .",
    "the threshold of 2 r is arbitrary but ensures that the remaining pixels are not coming from bright enhanced h@xmath28 regions caused by an increase of the electron density .",
    "+ - pixels with high hi column densities ( n(hi )  @xmath29  6  10@xmath30 h  @xmath16 ) are removed .",
    "we use this hi threshold rather than that derived in boulanger et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and lagache et al .",
    "( 1999 ) since it increases the statistics by 30@xmath2 .",
    "with such a criterium , the contribution of the cold dust emission is lower than 3@xmath2 in the far - infrared bands .",
    "+ we keep 122 firas pixels , corresponding to 2@xmath2 of the sky .",
    "ir emission that can be correlated with the ionised gas can not be simply related to this gas phase as for the hi component .",
    "emission from hi gas is proportional to n(hi ) , whereas wim emission is derived from the emission measure which is proportional to @xmath32 ( where @xmath33 is the wim electron density ) .",
    "thus , the wim intensity measured in rayleighs , considering a constant electron density along the line of sight , is proportional to @xmath34 . for a wim dust temperature of @xmath35=8000",
    "k , we compute a conversion factor ( from osterbrock , 1989 ) : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the @xmath38 column density normalised at 10@xmath30 h @xmath16 .",
    "this conversion factor depends weakly on the temperature .",
    "we see from eq .",
    "( [ conv_1 ] ) that it is impossible to disentangle if variations in i@xmath0 are due to variations in the electron density or variations in the h@xmath8 column density . + for our sample , the mean h@xmath0 intensity is equal to 0.69  r with a standard deviation of 0.37  r. for the case where h@xmath0 intensity variations are only due to variations in n@xmath39 with a constant h@xmath8 column density , we can estimate the infered electron densities . for our selected pixels ,",
    "the minimal and maximal h@xmath0 intensity is equal to 0.2 r and 1.9 r respectively .",
    "this gives a variation in the electron density by a factor of @xmath4010 .",
    "such a variation is not expected in our very diffuse high galactic latitude regions averaged in the firas 7@xmath20 beam .",
    "this is supported by the study of reynolds ( 1991 ) who has derived for the mean electron density @xmath41=0.08 @xmath42 along high latitude sightlines a dispersion of 0.04 @xmath42 .",
    "thus we conclude that most of the h@xmath0 intensity variations in the data used for this study are due to variations in h@xmath8 column density rather than in n@xmath39 . using @xmath41=0.08 @xmath43 0.04 @xmath42",

    "a , b and the constant term c are determined simultaneously using regression fits . before performing the infrared regression analysis ,",
    "we have correlated the hi with the h@xmath8 gas .",
    "the correlation coefficient between these emission lines is about 38@xmath2 for the selected pixels .",
    "such a weak correlation may come from the cosecant variation of the two components . removing the cosecant variations before the analysis results in a correlation coefficient of zero .",
    "+ at dirbe wavelengths the fit has been done using a relative weight computed from the standard deviation maps .",
    "the statistic uncertainty on a and b coefficients are very small compared to real variations of a and b across the sky .",

    "+ the a , b and c values obtained using different weights for the fit are very consistent .",
    "only their statistical uncertainties change significantly .",

    "it only changes the normalisation of b. + before computing the regression fit analysis , we should have removed the cosecant law variations for each of the components : dust , hi and h@xmath8 .",
    "however , due to small statistics ( @xmath40 2@xmath2 of the sky ) , it is very difficult to accuratly derive the slopes of these relationships .",
    "we have checked using dirbe data at 100 , 140 and 240 @xmath1 m ( at the 7@xmath20 resolution ) that the results derived by removing the best estimate of the cosecant variations before the fit are in good agreement with ones obtained without this correction .",

    "<S> we have used the wham h@xmath0 survey and leiden / dwingeloo hi data to decompose the far - infrared emission ( from 100 to 1000 @xmath1 m ) at high galactic latitude into components associated with the warm ionised medium ( wim ) and the warm neutral medium ( wnm ) . </S>",
    "<S> this decomposition is possible for the first time thanks to preliminary wham data that cover a significant fraction of the sky ( about 10@xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm the first detection of dust emission from the wim ( lagache et al . 1999 ) and show that the wim dust temperature and emissivity are very similar to those in the wnm . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis suggests moreover that about 25@xmath2 of the far - ir dust emission at high galactic latitude is uncorrelated with the hi gas . </S>",
    "<S> the decomposition again reveals a cosmic far - infrared background ( cfirb ) which is determined for the first time from 100 to 1000 @xmath1 m using two independant gas tracers . </S>"
