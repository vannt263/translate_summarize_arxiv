    "weak measurement was originally proposed by aharonov , albert , and vaidman  @xcite as an extension to the standard von neumann model of quantum measurement , inspired by the two - state vector formalism of quantum mechanical measurement  @xcite .",
    "this formalism is characterized by the pre- and post - selected states of the measured system .",
    "in contrast to an ideal ( strong ) measurement , weak measurement extracts very little information about the measured system from a single outcome , but the measured state does not collapse . although each outcome of weak measurement includes a large uncertainty , the averaged value in multiple trials can build up a significant value , called a weak value , without state collapse .",
    "this feature makes weak measurement an ideal tool for examining the fundamentals of quantum physics , such as quantum correlation and quantum dynamics ; for instance , see the reviews  @xcite .    on the basis of the above property",
    ", recent works have theoretically shown that weak measurement can be used for observing the quantum wavefunction  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to conventional quantum - state tomography  @xcite , this scheme records the complex - valued weak values describing the wavefunction of the quantum state and requires less post - processing .",
    "recently , lundeen and his colleagues demonstrated weak measurement of the one - dimensional transverse wavefunction  @xcite . since then , state tomography via weak measurement has been applied to several physical systems , such as an average photon trajectory  @xcite , a polarization state  @xcite , and an orbital angular momentum state  @xcite .",
    "all of these demonstrations , however , require the experimental configuration to measure two noncommutative operators , such as a position operator @xmath0 and its momentum operator @xmath1 , onto the probe state of the weak measurement .    in this paper , we propose a stereographical - visualization scheme for a polarization state by two - dimensional imaging of the weak value with two commutative position operators .",
    "the key idea is to employ laguerre  gaussian ( lg ) modes for a probe state in weak measurement , and it weakly interacts with the measured polarization state , as proposed in refs .",
    "the lg mode has a zero - intensity point ( zip ) in the center , which is generally called an _",
    "optical vortex _",
    "@xcite , and several generation methods have been proposed and demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "note that the relationship between the optical vortex beam and the weak value has been pointed out from different viewpoints  @xcite . according to refs .",
    "@xcite , we can extract information on the polarization state from a single image as the two - dimensional location of the zip , which corresponds to the stereographic projection point of the polarization state on the poincar sphere .",
    "we also experimentally verify the stereographical relationship between the polarization state and the location of the zip .",
    "furthermore , this is a practical demonstration of weak measurement using an optical vortex beam as the probe state .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we show the stereographical relationship between a polarization state on the poincar sphere and a weak value of a polarization state and propose a stereographical- visualization scheme for the polarization state by using the weak measurement with an optical vortex beam . in sec .",
    "iii , we experimentally implement our scheme by using a polarizing sagnac interferometer including a specialized half - wave plate , called @xmath2 plate .",
    "we demonstrate our proposed scheme and evaluate its accuracy from the fidelity of the measurement results .",
    "summary and discussion are presented in sec .",
    "iv .     on bloch sphere to the zip , @xmath3 . as an example , the @xmath4 case is illustrated.,width=283 ]",
    "let us consider the geometrical relationship between a weak value and a two - dimensional quantum ( qubit ) state .",
    "let any qubit state @xmath5 spanned by orthonormal basis states @xmath6 and @xmath7 be denoted as @xmath8 where @xmath9 , and @xmath10 . here , the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 uniquely specify a point on the unit sphere @xmath13 , called the bloch sphere , which is the same as the poincar sphere in optics , in which the states @xmath6 and @xmath7 correspond to the north and south poles , respectively .",
    "we consider the weak value of the observable @xmath14 , which is the @xmath15 component of the pauli matrices , with the post - selected state @xmath7 : @xmath16 which is generally a complex value .",
    "this weak value gives a geometrical mapping of the qubit state on the bloch sphere , namely , the stereographic projection , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stereo_projection ] .",
    "the stereographic projection is one way to make a flat map of a spherical surface .",
    "let @xmath17 denote the north pole on the bloch sphere .",
    "given a point @xmath18 related to the qubit state @xmath5 , other than @xmath17 , the line connecting @xmath17 and @xmath18 intersects a certain flat complex ( two - dimensional real ) plane orthogonal to the line connecting @xmath17 and @xmath19 at exactly one point , @xmath20 .",
    "thus , the stereographic projection can be taken as the map @xmath21 . from a geometrical viewpoint",
    ", it is easily understood that the stereographically projected point corresponding to the weak value can become far from the origin of the complex plane .",
    "the south pole @xmath19 appears at the origin of the complex plane .",
    "lines of latitude appear as circles around this origin .",
    "the southern hemisphere of the bloch sphere is not stretched very much in the map , but the northern hemisphere is stretched quite a bit , and the north pole is at infinity .    to extract the real and imaginary parts of the weak value from a single image , we can use the lg mode as the probe state  @xcite .",
    "the lg mode is one of the natural solutions of the paraxial wave equation and is characterized by a radial index @xmath22 and an azimuthal index @xmath23 .",
    "the modes have an annular intensity distribution around the zip .",
    "the wavefront of the lg modes is composed of @xmath24 intertwined helical wavefronts , with a handedness given by the sign of @xmath23 . in what follows",
    ", we consider the optical vortex beam with @xmath25 and @xmath26 for simplicity .",
    "the amplitude distribution of the lg mode is given as @xmath27 where @xmath28 corresponds to the beam width , and @xmath29 determines the zip as the origin . unlike a fundamental gaussian mode ( @xmath30 ) , the lg mode is no longer factorable in two directions , @xmath15 and @xmath31 , and this is a key factor for retrieving the real and imaginary parts of the weak value from a single image .",
    "to apply the weak measurement scheme , we use the von neumann interaction hamiltonian , @xmath32 where the coupling constant @xmath33 is sufficiently small , and @xmath1 is the momentum observable on the probe system conjugate to the commuting position observable @xmath0 . for simplicity , we assume the interaction to be impulsive at time @xmath34 . after the interaction between the system state and the lg mode probe states , we post - select the system in @xmath7 , resulting in the probe state described as @xmath35 with @xmath36 . note that this approximation is justified under the condition @xmath37 without this condition , the exact calculation can be described ( see appendix a ) . from eq .",
    "( [ eq:6 ] ) , the spatial intensity distribution of the probe state after post - selection can be calculated as @xmath38 .",
    "\\label{eq:8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , the zip is shifted by the real and imaginary parts of the weak value @xmath39 in the two - dimensional image .",
    "consequently , we can determine the qubit state on the bloch sphere from the zip related to the stereographic projection , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stereo_projection ] .",
    "it is remarkable that our scheme can be generalized to the mixed state case , in which the qubit state is inside the bloch sphere .",
    "the above procedure is applied to different post - selected states , e.g. , @xmath6 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .",
    "then , we can always choose at least two imaging planes to satisfy the approximation condition ( [ eq:7 ] ) .",
    "from the two zips , we can find the crossing point on the stereographic projection , which is the qubit state in the mixed state case . according to refs .",
    "@xcite , we need to prepare at least four imaging planes for any unknown qubit state .",
    "figure  [ fig : polarization_weak_measurement_setup ] shows our experimental setup for demonstrating direct mapping of the polarization state onto the zip .",
    "we use a fiber - pigtailed continuous - wave laser with a wavelength of 785 nm , a power of 5 mw , and a beam waist radius of 1 mm .",
    "first , we prepare the fundamental gaussian beam ( @xmath42 ) with an arbitrary polarization state using half - wave plates and quarter - wave plates in the state preparation stage .",
    "next , we convert the spatial mode to the lg mode using a specially fabricated wave plate called a @xmath2 plate  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 plate has a suitably patterned transverse optical axis to couple the photon spin ( polarization ) with its orbital angular momentum  @xcite .",
    "here , we use a @xmath2 plate ( altechna , rpc-800 - 6 ) with a singularity charge @xmath43 and uniform birefringent retardation @xmath44 .",
    "this @xmath2 plate can modify the mode number @xmath23 to @xmath45 , the sign of which depends on the input polarization .",
    "the helicity of the output circular polarization is also inverted .    to implement the above mode conversion without changing the output polarization , we propose a mode conversion setup based on a polarizing sagnac interferometer ( psi ) including the @xmath2 plate .",
    "this setup ideally is 100% efficient for mode conversion and has good stability because of self - compensation of the optical paths inside the interferometer .",
    "the incident polarization remains unchanged because of the same optical path in the right - circulating and left - circulating paths inside the interferometer .",
    "a single polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) is used as the entry and exit gates of the device .",
    "the pbs splits the incident beam into its horizontal component @xmath46 and its vertical component @xmath47 , which circulate inside the interferometer along the same path , but in opposite directions .",
    "the spatial mode of each polarization component is converted to the lg mode with @xmath48 by using quarter - wave plates with an angle of @xmath49 and the @xmath2 plate . after being reflected by the mirrors , they recombine again and exit the interferometer from the other side of the pbs . after passing through the interferometer , the two counter - propagating orthogonal polarizations @xmath50 and @xmath51 gain the same optical length . in this way , our setup can convert the incident fundamental gaussian mode ( @xmath42 ) to the lg mode ( @xmath48 ) without a polarization change .    inside the psi ,",
    "the weak interaction is obtained by slightly tilting the mirror of the psi as expressed in eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) .",
    "after it passes through the psi , we post - select the polarization state into the right circular polarization basis @xmath52 and observe the spatial intensity distribution using a ccd image sensor with a pixel size of @xmath53 . recall that our setup differs from the measurement interaction of the optical paths in the sagnac interferometer  @xcite .",
    "note also that this extends previous experimental studies on weak measurement of the polarization  @xcite .",

    "next , we observed the polarization states along the more complex path , namely , the @xmath54-shaped path on the southern hemisphere of the poincar sphere . the @xmath54-shaped path is realized by using two quarter - wave plates , one of which is rotated and the other of which is fixed at an angle of 45@xmath55 with respect to the direction of the input linear polarization",

    ", we can explore the implications of polarization measurements at very low light levels . for a very small number of independent photons",
    ", our formalism suggests that each photon represents an individual stochastic event described by a spatial probability density function .",
