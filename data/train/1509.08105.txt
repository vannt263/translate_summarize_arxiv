    "we note that there exist different and more systematic ways to obtain an mmv problem similar to from the data @xmath164\\}$ ] and which guarantee a unique @xmath8-sparse solution @xcite .",

    "we summarize this result as follows .",
    "let @xmath36 be a signal which occupies @xmath8 out of @xmath26 frequency bands of length @xmath39",
    ". for @xmath183 there exists modulating functions @xmath119 and @xmath45 where @xmath70 , @xmath71 such that @xmath147 can be reconstructed ( up to a phase factor ) from phaseless measurements taken with the sampling system of fig .",
    "[ fig : modul1 ] and [ fig : modul2 ] .",
    "we actually designed concrete modulating sequences @xmath45 and @xmath119 which allow signal recovery from the phaseless measurements .",

    "if this condition is not satisfied , the phase propagation described in step ii breaks down .",
    "however , the set of all signals in @xmath182 for which @xmath144 = 0 $ ] for some @xmath135 is a very thin set in @xmath182 @xcite , such that the proposed approach will recover `` almost every '' signal in @xmath182 .",

    "if the support of @xmath184 would be known , then there exists a sampling scheme which allows to reconstruct @xmath147 from samples taken at an average rate which can be arbitrarily close to the laudau rate @xmath186 .",
    "the sampling scheme described above has @xmath187 parallel branches , with @xmath188 . in each branch",
    "the squared amplitude of the signals are sampled at a rate @xmath189 .",
    "so the overall average sampling rate of the proposed scheme is equal to @xmath190 so compared with the situations where we have access to amplitude and phase measurements and where we have knowledge of the band locations , we need an eight times higher sampling rate . we lose a factor @xmath191 because the band locations are unknown @xcite , and we lose an additional factor @xmath192 , because only amplitude samples are available @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that our main focus in this contribution lies on the general approach to include phaseless measurements into sub - nyquist sampling systems .",
    "using the sub - nyquist approach of @xcite the infinite - dimensional problem reduces to a finite - dimensional cs problem . then the phaseless measurements can be implemented similarly as in finite - dimensional phase retrieval problems .",

    "there are many technical details @xcite concerning the sub - nyquist sampling system which we omitted for simplicity of the presentation .",
    "similarly , a slightly simplified signal model was used were the signal bands have fixed positions . the generalization to a model with arbitrary band locations as in @xcite is straightforward .",
