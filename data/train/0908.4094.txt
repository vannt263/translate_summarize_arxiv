    "codes in permutations form a classical subject of coding theory .",
    "various metric functions on the symmetric group @xmath1 have been considered , giving rise to diverse combinatorial problems .",
    "the most frequently studied metric on @xmath1 is the hamming distance .",
    "codes in @xmath1 with the hamming distance , traditionally called permutation arrays , have been a subject of a large number of papers ; see , e.g. , the works by blake et al . @xcite and colbourn",
    "et al . @xcite .",
    "in this paper we are interested in a different metric on @xmath1 which we proceed to define .",

    "@xmath4 from @xmath5 to another permutation @xmath6 is defined as the minimum number of transpositions of pairwise adjacent elements required to change @xmath5 into @xmath7 denote by @xmath8 the metric space of permutations on @xmath0 elements equipped with the distance @xmath9    the kendall distance originates in statistics and has been adopted as a measure of quality of codes under the so - called rank modulation scheme first considered by chadwick and kurz @xcite . in this scheme ,",
    "the transmitted sequences are given by permutations of @xmath0 elements while information is carried by the relative magnitude ( rank ) of elements in the permutation rather than by the absolute value of the elements .",
    "the motivation for considering this scheme in @xcite stems from systems in which transmitted signals are subjected to impulse noise that changes the value of the signal substantially but has less effect on the relative magnitude of the neighboring signals . recently ( and independently of @xcite ) rank modulation was suggested by jiang et al .",
    "@xcite as a means of efficient writing of information into flash memories . rewriting the contents of a group of memory cells is easy if one needs to increase the charges of the cells or leave some of them unchanged and impractical if some of the charges need to be decreased .",
    "furthermore , reliability of the data stored in flash memory is affected by the drift in the charge of the cells caused for instance by aging devices or other reasons .",
    "since the drift in different cells may occur at different speed , errors introduced in the data are adequately accounted for by tracking the relative value of adjacent cells , i.e. , the kendall distance between the groups of cells in memory .",
    "these considerations make rank modulation suitable for coding for flash memories .",
    "more details of both the writing and the error processes in memory are given in @xcite and references in that paper .",
    "the focus of our work is on bounds and constructions of codes in the kendall space @xmath10 coding - theoretic considerations call for estimating the volume of the sphere in @xmath11 because it can be used to derive basic bounds on the size of codes .",
    "spheres in the kendall space were studied by analytic means in a number of earlier works @xcite relying on the well - known correspondence of permutations and their inversion vectors ; however it turned out that code bounds that can be obtained from these works do not lead to nontrivial ( other than 0 or 1 ) values of the code rate . regarding specific code families for correcting kendall errors ,",
    "the only previous work is that by jiang et al .",
    "@xcite who constructed a family of single - error - correcting codes of size @xmath12 i.e. , at least half the maximum possible .    in this paper",
    "we discuss several possible ways to bound the size of codes for rank modulation of a given distance , often calling them rank permutation codes .",
    "we derive a singleton - type bound and sphere - packing bounds on such codes .",
    "since the maximum value of the distance in @xmath11 is @xmath13 , this leaves a number of possibilities for the scaling rate of the distance for asymptotic analysis , ranging from @xmath14 to @xmath15 these turn out to be the two extremes for the size of optimal rank permutation codes .",
    "namely , earlier work in combinatorics of permutations implies that a code with distance @xmath16 occupies a vanishing proportion of the space @xmath11 while a code of distance @xmath17 can take a close - to - one proportion of its volume .",
    "we cover the intermediate cases , showing that the size of optimal codes with distance @xmath18 scales as @xmath19 it is interesting that unlike many other asymptotic coding problems , the kendall space of permutations affords an exact answer for the growth rate of the size of optimal codes .",
    "the proof of the bounds relies on weight - preserving embeddings of @xmath11 into other metric spaces which provide insights into the asymptotic size of codes .",
    "we also show the existence of a family of rank permutation codes that correct a constant number of errors and have size within a constant factor of the sphere packing bound .",
    "the construction relies on the well - known bose - chowla theorem in additive number theory .",
    "section ii of our paper is devoted to the relation of the kendall metric space to other metric spaces related to permutations . in section",
    "iii we use these insights to derive bounds on codes for rank modulation , and conduct their asymptotic analysis .",
    "section iv contains a construction of @xmath20-error - correcting rank permutation codes .",
    "we begin with recalling basic properties of the distance @xmath21 such as its relation to the number of inversions in the permutation , and weight - preserving embeddings of @xmath1 into other metric spaces .",
    "their proofs and a detailed discussion are found for instance in the books by comtet @xcite or knuth ( * ? ? ?",
    "the distance @xmath21 is a right - invariant metric which means that @xmath22 for any @xmath23 where the operation is the usual multiplication of permutations .",
    "therefore , we can define the weight of the permutation @xmath5 as its distance to the identity permutation @xmath24 because of the invariance , the graph whose vertices are indexed by the permutations and edges connect permutations one kendall step apart , is regular of degree @xmath25 at the same time it is not distance - regular , and so the machinery of algebraic combinatorics does not apply to the analysis of code structure .",
    "the diameter of the space @xmath11 equals @xmath26 and is realized by pairs of opposite permutations such as @xmath27 and @xmath28    the main tool to study properties of @xmath21 is provided by the inversion vector of the permutation .",
    "an inversion in a permutation @xmath29 is a pair @xmath30 such that @xmath31 and @xmath32 it is easy to see that @xmath33 , the total number of inversions in @xmath34 therefore , for any two permutations @xmath35 we have @xmath36 in other words , @xmath37 ^ 2 : i\\ne j , \\pi(i ) > \\pi(j ) , \\sigma(i ) < \\sigma(j)\\}|.\\ ] ]    to a permutation @xmath29 we associate an _ inversion vector _",
    "@xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the set of integers modulo @xmath41 .",
    "it is well known that the mapping from permutations to the space of inversion vectors is one - to - one , and any permutation can be easily reconstructed from its inversion vector .",
    "moreover , @xmath42 for the type of errors that we consider below we introduce the following @xmath43 distance function on @xmath44 @xmath45 where the computations are performed over the integers , and write @xmath46 for the corresponding weight function ( this is not a properly defined norm because @xmath47 is not a linear space)-tuples , @xmath48 @xcite . ] .",
    "for instance , let @xmath49 then @xmath50 to compute the distance @xmath51 we find @xmath52    observe that the mapping @xmath53 is a weight - preserving bijection between @xmath11 and the set @xmath47 .",
    "at the same time , since the groups @xmath1 and @xmath47 are not isomorphic ( one is commutative while the other is not ) , this mapping is not distance - preserving .",
    "however , a weaker property is true , namely , @xmath54 indeed , if the kendall distance between two permutations is @xmath55 , then the @xmath43 distance between the corresponding two inversion vectors is @xmath55 as well .",
    "the converse is not necessarily true .    from ( [ eq : dd ] )",

    "clearly the hamming weight of @xmath59 equals @xmath64 and so this mapping is an isometry between @xmath11 and a subset of the hamming space @xmath65 .",
    "this mapping was first considered in @xcite .",
