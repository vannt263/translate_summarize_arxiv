    "the propagation of cosmic rays ( crs ) is affected by their interaction with magnetic field .",
    "this field is turbulent and therefore , the resonant interaction of cosmic rays with mhd turbulence has been discussed by many authors as the principal mechanism to scatter and isotropize cosmic rays ( @xcite ) . although cosmic ray diffusion can happen while cosmic rays follow wandering magnetic fields @xcite , the acceleration of cosmic rays requires efficient scattering .    while most investigations are restricted to alfvn waves propagating along an external magnetic field ( the so - called slab model of alfvnic turbulence ) , obliquely propagating mhd waves have been included in @xcite and later studies @xcite .",
    "the problem , however , is that the alfvnic turbulence considered in their studies is isotropic turbulence , and this is contrary to the modern understanding of mhd turbulence ( @xcite , see @xcite for a review and references therein ) .",
    "a recent study @xcite found a strong dependence of scattering on turbulence anisotropy .",
    "therefore the calculations of cr scattering must be done using a realistic mhd turbulence model .",
    "an important attempt in this direction was carried out in @xcite .",
    "there alfvn modes were treated in the spirit of goldreich - shridhar @xcite ( 1995 , henceforth gs95 ) model of incompressible turbulence and marginal scattering was obtained . however",
    ", a more accurate description is now available ( @xcite ) and thus there is a need to revisit the problem .",
    "moreover , @xcite did not consider compressible modes , while we show below that these modes provide the dominant contribution to the scattering .",
    "mhd perturbations can be decomposed into alfvnic , slow and fast modes ( see @xcite ) .",
    "alfvnic turbulence is considered by many authors as the default model of interstellar magnetic turbulence .",
    "this is partially motivated by the fact that unlike compressible modes , the alfvn ones are essentially free of damping in fully ionized medium ( see @xcite ) .",
    "unlike hydrodynamic turbulence , alfvnic turbulence is anisotropic , with eddies elongated along the magnetic field .",
    "this happens because it is easier to mix the magnetic field lines perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field rather than to bend them .",
    "the gs95 model describes _",
    "incompressible _ alfvnic turbulence , which formally means that plasma @xmath0 is infinity .",
    "it was first conjectured in @xcite that gs95 scaling should be approximately true for moderately compressible plasma .",
    "for low @xmath1 plasma cho & lazarian @xcite ( henceforth cl02 ) showed that the coupling of alfvnic and compressible modes is weak and that the alfvnic modes follow the gs95 spectrum @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the analysis of observational data ( @xcite ) . in what follows",
    ", we consider both alfvn modes and compressible modes and use the description of those modes obtained in cl02 to study cr scattering by mhd turbulence in a medium with energy injection scale @xmath2pc , density @xmath3@xmath4 temperature @xmath5k .",
    "recent observations @xcite suggest that matter in the galactic halos is magnetic - dominant , corresponding to low @xmath6 medium , here we choose @xmath7 .",
    "the injection length scale is important as alfvnic turbulence exhibits scale - dependent anisotropy that increases with the decrease of the scale .",
    "we describe mhd turbulence statistics by correlation functions . using the notations from @xcite",
    ", we get the expressions for the correlation tensors in fourier space    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the magnetic field fluctuations .",

    "assuming equipartition , the kinetic energy density @xmath13 , we get @xmath14 .",
    "the analytical fit to the anisotropic tensor for alfvn modes , obtained in @xcite is , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a 2d matrix in x - y plane , @xmath17 is the wave vector along the local mean magnetic field ( see@xcite ) , @xmath18 is the wave vector perpendicular to the magnetic field and the normalization constant @xmath19 .",
    "the tensors in @xcite used step function instead of the exponent .",
    "we assume that for the alfvn modes @xmath20 @xmath21 where the fractional helicity @xmath22 is independent of @xmath23 ( @xcite ) .",
    "numerical calculations in cl02 demonstrated that slow modes follow gs95 scalings .",

    "the latter requires longitudinal motions . however , fast modes are subject to collisionless damping which suppresses scattering@xcite",

    "since the @xmath82 decreases with @xmath1 , the scattering frequency decreases with @xmath1 .    adopting the tensors given in eq.(5 ) , it is possible to calculate the scattering frequency of crs in high @xmath33 medium .",
    "for instance , for density @xmath85@xmath4 temperature @xmath86k , magnetic field @xmath87 g , the mean free path is smaller than the resonant wavelength for the particles with energy larger than @xmath88 , therefore collisional damping rather than landau damping should be taken into account .",
    "nevertheless , our results show that the fast modes still dominate the crs scattering in spite of the viscous damping .",
    "apart from the gyroresonance , fast modes potentially can scatter crs by transit - time damping ( ttd ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "ttd happens due to the resonant interaction with parallel magnetic mirror force @xmath89 . for small amplitude waves",
    ", particles should be in phase with the wave so as to have a secular interaction with wave .",
    "this gives the cherenkov resonant condition @xmath90 , corresponding to the @xmath91 term in eq.([genmu ] ) . from the condition",
    ", we see that the contribution is mostly from nearly perpendicular propagating waves ( @xmath92 ) . according to eq.(4),we",
    "see that the corresponding correlation tensor for the magnetic fluctuations @xmath93 are very small , so the contribution from ttd to scattering is not important .",
    "self - confinement due to the streaming instability has been discussed by different authors(@xcite ) as an effective alternative to scatter crs and essential for cr acceleration by shocks .",
    "however , we will discuss in our next paper that in the presence of the turbulence the streaming instability will be partially suppressed owing to the nonlinear interaction with the background turbulence .",
    "thus the gyroresonance with the fast modes is the principle mechanism for scattering cosmic rays .",
    "this demands a substantial revision of cosmic ray acceleration / propagation theories , and many related problems may need to be revisited . for instance , our results may be relevant to the problems of the boron to carbon abundances ratio .",
    "we shall discuss the implications of the new emerging picture elsewhere .",
    "in the paper above we have shown that      \\2 .",
    "gyroresonance is the most important for pitch angle scattering .",
