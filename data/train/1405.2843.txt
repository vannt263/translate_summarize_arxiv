    "in this section we present a collection of high precision numerical data as well as some details on the numerical simulations .",
    "we performed the simulations by an itebd - code , which made use of the @xmath55 rotational symmetry of the xxz model around the @xmath16-axis .",
    "maximal bond dimensions of the @xmath55 blocks were set to @xmath56 , resulting in a total bond dimension @xmath57 .",
    "we used a first order trotter - expansion for the time evolution operator with a time step @xmath58 , and verified that decreasing this time step does not modify our results .    to control the reliability of our data , we computed the truncated weight at each time - step , and requested that the one - step truncated weight be less than @xmath59 .",
    "as an alternative method , we ran the code with different bond dimensions and determined the time , where the results deviated upon increasing bond dimension .",
    "the two methods resulted in approximately the same threshold time .",
    "the error bars in fig .  2 of the main text and tables [ neeltab ] and [ dimtab ] below",
    "were then estimated by extracting the minimal and maximal values of the correlators before the threshold time in the last time interval of length @xmath60 .    for @xmath61 and @xmath62",
    "it is difficult to estimate the error because for the times the simulation can reach there is still a drift of the correlation functions ; in these cases the errors shown in the tables are computed from the fluctuations around this drifting average .",
    "the remaining drift of the average introduces a further systematical error , which is not included in our statistical estimate , and is hard to quantify reliably .        checking the sum rule ( 11 ) by plugging in our numerical solution for different values of @xmath13 for both initial states we found that while both the overlap ( 6 ) and the entropy ( 8) are of order @xmath63 their difference , i.e. the quench action ( 5 ) is of order @xmath64 and shrinks while increasing the number of equations included , therefore it is interpreted as a numerical error of the truncated otba system .",
    "this provides very strong evidence that we indeed found the correct saddle point solution .",
    "the estimates of the asymptotic values of the correlations together with the otba predictions are listed for various @xmath13 values in table  [ neeltab ] for the zero momentum nel state and in table  [ dimtab ] for the dimer initial states .",
    "based on the accuracy of the saturation of the sum rule and of the mean values of conserved charges , we can trust the results of the otba at least up to 7 digits .",
    "the tables also show the tgge predictions and , when available from @xcite , the predictions of the full gge as well .    in the nel case the difference between the otba and tgge results @xcite is smaller than the accuracy of the itebd , except for @xmath65 where the tgge seems to fail .",
    "however , in this case the tgge with 6 charges has not yet converged in the truncation level .",
    "we expect that in the nel case only the quenches to @xmath66 can conclusively decide between the otba and gge predictions ."
