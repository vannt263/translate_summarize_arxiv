    "doubly - charged higgs bosons ( @xmath1 ) appear in exotic higgs representations such as found in left - right symmetric models .",
    "the current experimental bound is @xmath2 @xcite from a search for @xmath3 at lep .    at the tevatron ,",
    "the two production mechanisms with potentially large cross section are pair production , @xmath4 or single production via @xmath5 fusion , @xmath6 . however",
    ", existing phenomenological and theoretical constraints are only easily satisfied if the @xmath7 coupling is vanishing ( or very small ) .",
    "therefore , in this analysis we will consider the discovery reach for detecting @xmath8 pair production at the tevatron .    in many models ,",
    "it is possible for the @xmath1 to couple to like - sign lepton pairs , @xmath9 .",
    "if the @xmath7 coupling is vanishing , it is then very likely that the doubly - charged higgs will decay to @xmath9 via the lepton - number - violating coupling .",
    "we will therefore concentrate upon @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .    alternatively ,",
    "if the @xmath13 and @xmath14 couplings are both vanishing or very small , then the @xmath1 can have a sufficiently long lifetime that it will decay outside the detector .",
    "identification of the @xmath8 pair via the associated @xmath15 distributions in the tracking chamber would then be possible .",
    "doubly - charged scalar particles abound in exotic higgs representations and appear in many models @xcite .",
    "for example , a higgs doublet representation with @xmath16 contains a doubly - charged @xmath17 and a singly - charged @xmath18 . if part of a multiplet with a neutral member , a @xmath17 would immediately signal the presence of a higgs representation with total isospin @xmath19 or higher .",
    "most popular are the complex @xmath20 triplet higgs representations , such as those required in left - right symmetric models , that contain a @xmath17 , a @xmath18 and a @xmath21 .    in assessing the attractiveness of a higgs sector model containing a @xmath17 many constraints need to be considered . for triplet and higher representations containing a neutral member , limits on the latter s vacuum expectation value ( vev ) required for @xmath22=1",
    "$ ] at tree - level are generally severe .",
    "( the first single representation beyond @xmath23 for which @xmath24 regardless of the vev is @xmath25 , whose @xmath26 member is doubly - charged . ) models with @xmath19 and @xmath27 can have @xmath24 at tree - level by combining representations",
    ". however , such models generally require fine - tuning in order to preserve @xmath24 at one - loop .",
    "the simplest way to avoid all @xmath28 problems is to either consider representations that simply do not have a neutral member ( for example , a @xmath16 doublet or a @xmath29 triplet representation ) , or else models in which the vev of the neutral member is precisely zero .",
    "we will only consider models of this type in what follows .",
    "further constraints on higgs representations arise if we require unification of the coupling constants without intermediate scale physics . in the standard model ,",
    "unification is possible for a relatively simple higgs sector that includes a single @xmath30 triplet in combination with either one or two @xmath31 doublets ( the preferred number of doublets depends upon the precise value of @xmath32 ) . in the case of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ,",
    "precise unification requires exactly two doublet higgs representations ( plus possible singlet representations ) ; any extra doublet representations ( including ones with a doubly - charged boson ) or any number of triplet or higher representations would destroy unification .",
    "however , by going beyond the minimal model and including appropriate intermediate - scale physics , supersymmetric models ( in particular , supersymmetric left - right symmetric models @xcite ) with triplet and higher representations can be made consistent with unification .    in short ,",
    "the popular two - doublet mssm need not be nature s choice",
    ". we should be on the look - out for signatures of exotic higgs representations , the clearest of which would be the existence of a doubly - charged higgs boson .",
    "thus , it is important to consider how to search for and study such a particle .",
    "the phenomenology of the @xmath17 derives from its couplings .",
    "tri - linear couplings of the type @xmath33 are not present in the absence of an enabling non - zero vev for the neutral member ( if present ) of the representation , and @xmath34 couplings are obviously absent .",
    "there are always couplings of the form @xmath35 .",
    "in addition , and of particular interest , there is the possibility of lepton - number - violating @xmath36 couplings in some models . for @xmath37",
    "the allowed cases are : @xmath38 note that the above cases do not include the @xmath25 representation that yields @xmath24 , nor the @xmath39 triplet with no neutral member , but do include the @xmath40 doublet representation with no neutral member , and the popular @xmath41 triplet representation . in left - right symmetric models there is a ` right - handed ' and a ` left - handed ' higgs triplet , both with @xmath30 .",
    "our analysis applies to the left - handed triplet ( whose neutral member must have a very small vev to preserve @xmath24 ) ; the phenomenology of the right - handed triplet is completely different .    in the case of a @xmath30 triplet representation ( to which we now specialize ) the lepton - number - violating coupling to ( left - handed",
    ") leptons is specified by the lagrangian form : @xmath42 where @xmath43 are generation indices , the @xmath44 s are the two - component left - handed lepton fields ( @xmath45 ) , and @xmath46 is the @xmath47 matrix of higgs fields : @xmath48    limits on the @xmath49 coupling strengths come from many sources . experiments that place limits on the @xmath49 by virtue of the @xmath50 couplings include bhabha scattering , @xmath51 , muonium - antimuonium conversion , and @xmath52 .",
    "these limits @xcite suggest small off - diagonal couplings ( as assumed in our analysis ) .",
    "writing @xmath53 the limits imply @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "regarding production mechanisms , the fusion process @xcite , @xmath56 , is absent since the required tri - linear coupling is zero if the vev of the neutral member ( if there is one ) of the higgs representation is zero ( as we assume so that @xmath24 naturally ) .",
    "single production of @xmath57 ( @xmath17 ) is possible in @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) collisions at lep2 ( hera ) via diagrams involving the @xmath60 or @xmath61 couplings .",
    "if @xmath62 saturates its upper limit , then lep2 and hera will probe up to @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "however , it is likely that @xmath62 is much smaller than its current bound and that these sources of single production will be negligible .",
    "thus , we focus on @xmath64 pair production , the cross section for which is determined entirely by the quantum numbers of the @xmath1 . for a general spin-0 boson @xmath65 , with weak isospin @xmath66 and charge @xmath67 , and a fermion @xmath68 , with @xmath69 and @xmath70 ,",
    "the @xmath71 pair - production cross section is : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the @xmath74 center of mass energy squared , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82^{-1}$ ] , and @xmath83 .",
    "we will consider a @xmath1 with @xmath84 . an extra factor of 1/3 is required for color averaging in @xmath85 annihilation in @xmath86 or @xmath87 collisions .",
    "= 3.250 in    in @xmath88 , kinematic reach is limited to @xmath89 ,  no more than about @xmath90 at a future @xmath91 nlc .",
    "we will find that the discovery reach at the tevatron can cover much , if not all , of this range , depending upon the dominant @xmath17 decay mode .",
    "the mass reach for pair production at a @xmath86 collider increases rapidly with machine energy .",
    "figure  [ fig : xsec ] shows the @xmath8 pair production cross section for both the tevatron ( at @xmath92 ) and the lhc . at the tevatron , @xmath93 at @xmath94 . with total accumulated luminosity of @xmath95 ( as planned for the 33  upgrade ) there would be about 27(7 ) @xmath96 events .",
    "the marginality of the latter number makes it clear that @xmath97 will be the ultimate mass reach possible at the tevatron .",
    "decays of a @xmath17 are generally quite exotic @xcite . for @xmath98 @xmath99 coupling",
    ", the only two - body decays that might be important are @xmath100 , @xmath101 and , if the lepton coupling is present , @xmath102 .",
    "typically , the @xmath17 and @xmath18 have similar masses , in which case @xmath101 is likely to be disallowed .",
    "thus , we will focus on the @xmath103 and @xmath9 final states . for a @xmath41 triplet",
    "we find @xcite @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the usual phase space suppression factor , and we used eq .",
    "( [ hlimitform ] ) . for example @xcite , if @xmath106 , @xmath107 we find @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "if any @xmath110 is near @xmath111 then @xmath112 is likely . since there are currently no limits on @xmath113 , the @xmath114 channel could easily have the largest partial width and be the dominant decay of the @xmath17 .",
    "on the other hand , if all the @xmath110 are very small then the @xmath103 mode is quite likely to be dominant if it is kinematically allowed .",
    "the implications for detection of @xmath96 pairs will now be discussed .",
    "the signal and backgrounds are simulated with the pythia monte carlo , which has been modified to allow the process : @xmath115 with the @xmath1 then forced to decay to like - sign lepton pairs .",
    "the events are then fed to a cdf detector simulation which includes the geometry of the run i cdf detector . for the main injector runs of the tevatron",
    ", the cdf and d0 detectors will both be upgraded to handle higher instantaneous luminosity .",
    "in addition , the acceptances of the upgraded detectors will improve .",
    "this simulation includes muon coverage for @xmath116 , which will be improved to @xmath117 for run ii .",
    "this results in approximately a @xmath118 improvement in acceptance for this process .",
    "events are passed through the normal cdf event reconstruction package .",
    "muon candidates must have tracks in both the central tracking and the muon chambers , electron candidates must have a track and an isolated electromagnetic calorimeter cluster . the lepton momenta",
    "are determined from the central tracking chamber and , if fiducial , the silicon microvertex detector . for tracks which do not pass through the microvertex detector ,",
    "the fit is performed assuming that the track originated from the interaction point .",
    "this so - called `` beam - constraint '' significantly improves momentum and , hence , mass resolution .",
    "for the case where the @xmath46 decays to like - sign leptons ( excluding taus ) , the signature is a spectacular @xmath120 or @xmath121 final state . here",
    "we will focus upon the @xmath121 final state .",
    "backgrounds are very similar for the two channels , although the discovery reach will be slightly higher in the electron channel due to better mass resolution and larger electromagnetic calorimeter coverage .",
    "the dominant backgrounds in the @xmath121 mode ( accepting at least 2 same - sign @xmath122 s as described below ) arise from electroweak processes where real high-@xmath123   muons are created from @xmath124 or @xmath125 decays along with either fake muons or muons from heavy flavor decay .",
    "the backgrounds are diboson production ( @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 ) ; @xmath129 production ( @xmath130 ) ; and boson plus jets ( @xmath131 , @xmath132 ) , where @xmath133 , @xmath134 and the jets produce real or fake muons .",
    "we use the measured cross sections for @xmath129 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 @xcite and the calculated cross sections for @xmath137 and @xmath138 production @xcite .",
    "the pdf world average branching ratios are used for @xmath139 ( 0.03367 ) and @xmath140 ( 0.104 ) @xcite .",
    "= 3.25 in    = 3.250 in    with a small event rate and small backgrounds , it is desirable to keep the selection criteria as loose as possible . to simulate the trigger ,",
    "we require one central muon with @xmath141 .",
    "next , at least two same - sign muons are required .",
    "this is sufficient to easily isolate a signal in the low mass region @xmath142 , but the background from dimuon top decay becomes an issue at higher masses .",
    "we expect very little additional activity in @xmath46 pair production other than the energy recoiling against the virtual @xmath143 . for dimuon",
    "top decay backgrounds , there is additional jet activity from the two @xmath144 decays .",
    "the third muon is supplied by one of these @xmath144 decays .",
    "the background in the high mass region from top decays can be greatly suppressed by requiring that the event has no more than one jet seen in the calorimeter ( @xmath145 ) with more than @xmath146 of transverse energy ( @xmath147 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : bk ] shows the same - sign muon mass contributions from each of the backgrounds listed above after all cuts . above @xmath148 in same - sign mass ,",
    "the dominant background is diboson production .",
    "figure  [ fig : mass ] shows the same - sign dimuon invariant mass distributions for both signal and background for three different @xmath46 masses : 100 , 200 and @xmath149 after all cuts have been applied .",
    "the signal - to - background ratio remains high at @xmath150 , although the dimuon mass resolution is worsening .",
    "the dimuon mass resolution is dominated by the @xmath123 resolution of the detector , which worsens at higher momenta . for the case",
    "@xmath10 the dielectron mass resolution does not degrade as rapidly due to the energy resolution of the electromagnetic calorimeter . in the case of a high mass search for @xmath1 decaying to muon or electron pairs , the technique would be a counting experiment , looking for an excess of high mass pairs over the small background .    the simulated data shown in figures  [ fig : bk ] and [ fig : mass ] represent the response of the run i cdf detector . the product of the efficiency and acceptance for a signal event to produce at least one entry in the same - sign mass plot depends upon @xmath151 , but is typically @xmath152 .",
    "if we assume that the efficiency will be the same for the run ii detector , scaling the acceptance to the improved muon coverage ( @xmath153 ) brings this number up to @xmath154 , an improvement factor in the accepted signal of @xmath155 .",
    "the corresponding scaling of the acceptance for the background is found to be @xmath156 over the entire mass region above @xmath157 .",
    "in addition to the significance of a bump in the same - sign mass distribution , there is additional information in the number of high-@xmath123 muons in the event . with the run",
    "i cdf detector used in this simulation , approximately @xmath118 of the signal events have four found muons , yielding two entries in the mass distribution , while @xmath158 of the background events have more than three muons such that both same - sign pairs have mass greater than @xmath159 . for the run ii detector ,",
    "these numbers go up to approximately @xmath160 for signal and @xmath161 for the background .",
    "the probability that a background event would have four muons * and both same - sign combinations near one - another in mass is exceedingly small .",
    "we therefore conclude that production of enough events so that two events are measured to have four muons ( in addition to the other same - sign dimuon mass entries from @xmath162 and @xmath163 muon events ) will be more than adequate to establish a signal for the @xmath1 . as an example using the numbers above : if @xmath164 events are produced , @xmath165 events would produce at least one same - sign mass pair . of those @xmath165 events , @xmath162 ( from 2.4 ) would have four found muons and @xmath166 ( from 3.6 ) would have @xmath162 or @xmath163 found muons , yielding @xmath167 entries in the same - sign mass plot on a background of approximately one same - sign dimuon mass pair and zero four muon events .",
    "tri - muon events offer little additional evidence for @xmath1 production , since background events often have two real , opposite - signed leptons in addition to one lepton from either a fake or heavy flavor decay . *",
    "using the criteria that @xmath164 pair - produced events would lead to an unambiguous discovery of the @xmath1 , we conclude that a reach of approximately @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 in the mass of the @xmath1 could be achieved in @xmath162 , @xmath164 , @xmath95 of tevatron running , respectively , for the cases where @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "unlike the electron and muon channels , reconstructing an invariant mass in the tau channel is problematic because of the neutrinos involved in their decay .",
    "we therefore use a counting method to estimate the reach of a doubly charged higgs search for run  ii .",
    "tau lepton identification is not trivial at a hadron collider .",
    "identification efficiencies are much lower than for electrons or muons ( @xmath174 ) and fake rates from qcd jets are significant ( @xmath175 ) . nonetheless , searching the tau lepton channel is worthwhile because the doubly charged higgs may preferentially couple to the taus , and the tau lepton offers the possibility of measuring the spin of its parent .",
    "selection of tau lepton candidates which decay into hadrons is detailed in @xcite .",
    "the algorithm begins by looking for jets in the calorimeter .",
    "the tau candidate must have one or three charged particles in a @xmath176 cone about the jet axis and no additional charged particles in a cone of @xmath177 .",
    "in addition , the tau candidate must have the correct total charge ( @xmath178 ) and have a mass consistent with a tau lepton . at a minimum",
    ", the cluster must have @xmath179  and the largest @xmath123 of an associated charged particle must exceed @xmath164  .",
    "finally , the tau candidate can not be consistent with an electron .",
    "currently , a fiducial cut of @xmath180 is required to maintain good charged particle tracking efficiency .",
    "the tracking coverage for the run  ii detector will be significantly larger and tracks will be measured with improved resolution .",
    "the corresponding gains in tau lepton acceptance have not been included in the results below .",
    "three types of triggers are considered for this search : inclusive electron and muon triggers for the case where at least one of the taus has decayed leptonically , an trigger which relies on the neutrinos in the tau decay , and a dedicated tau lepton trigger which identifies tau leptons from tracking or calorimetry information early in the triggering system .",
    "these triggers correspond to triggers used in run  i and allow the background from fake taus to be estimated from data . for the estimates below the logical or of the missing  and the inclusive lepton triggers has been used .",
    "the threshold on the  trigger is @xmath181  and the threshold on the inclusive lepton triggers is @xmath182  .",
    "the primary tau lepton in an event must have @xmath182  .",
    "pair production of doubly charged higgs produces events with four taus in the final state .",
    "approximately @xmath154 of these events contain three or more taus which decay into hadrons .",
    "to reduce the background from fake taus to a reasonable level , a selected event must have at least three identified hadronic tau lepton candidates and an additional jet , electron , muon , or hadronic tau candidate .",
    "the expected number of signal events in a @xmath164  sample for various @xmath17 masses is shown in table  [ exptt ] .",
    "cd2@@xmath183d2 @xmath184 ( ) & + @xmath185 & 19 . &",
    "+ @xmath186 & 8.8 & 0.6 + @xmath187 & 3.07 & 0.20 + @xmath188 & 0.72 & 0.11 + @xmath189 & 0.23 & 0.03 +    the backgrounds are expected to come from two sources  processes which produce real taus and processes which produce jets which fluctuate to imitate tau leptons .",
    "the expected number of events containing multiple fake tau leptons was estimated from the run  i data sample .",
    "no events pass the selection requirements .",
    "top and diboson production are expected to be the largest source of background events with real tau leptons .",
    "both of these were estimated from monte carlo .",
    "again , no events passed the strict topology cuts .",
    "given the large data samples expected in run  ii , both of these backgrounds should be measured rather precisely .",
    "given that no background events pass the selection requirement , it is difficult to quantitatively define the number of events necessary to claim a discovery .",
    "nonetheless , the background is likely to be quite small , so a handful of events should be considered significant . arbitrarily taking five events as the standard ,",
    "a search for doubly charged higgs in the tau channel would have a reach of approximately @xmath190 and @xmath191  in samples of @xmath164 and @xmath192  , respectively .",
    "the cuts , trigger , _ etc .",
    "_  have not been optimized , so these should be considered conservative estimates of the run  ii reach .",
    "although currently out of favor because of the success of the minimal supersymmetric model , there are well - motivated models containing triplet and other higgs representations which include a @xmath17 higgs boson that has small ( most naturally zero ) @xmath193 coupling but possibly non - zero @xmath9 coupling .",
    "it is then very possible that @xmath194 for @xmath195 , @xmath122 , or ( most probably ? ) @xmath196 .",
    "we have demonstrated that detection of the @xmath17 at the tevatron ( operating at @xmath92 with @xmath197 ) will then be possible for @xmath151 up to @xmath149 for @xmath195 or @xmath122 and @xmath198 for @xmath199 .",

    "[ fig : xsec ] the corresponding limits at the lhc by requiring the same raw number of events before cuts and efficiencies as needed at the tevatron  @xmath200 for @xmath201 and @xmath202 for @xmath199  yielding @xmath151 discovery up to roughly @xmath203 ( @xmath204 ) for @xmath201 and @xmath205 ( @xmath206 ) for @xmath199 , assuming total integrated luminosity of @xmath207 ( @xmath208 ) . for @xmath201 , the reach of the lhc detectors",
    "will likely be even greater than this , due to the improved lepton acceptance and resolution anticipated over the current generation of hadron collider detectors .",

    "a full study is necessary to evaluate this .    as detailed in @xcite , if a @xmath17 is found then @xmath209 and @xmath210 colliders capable of high luminosity at @xmath211 will become a priority in order to actually determine the @xmath110 s .",
