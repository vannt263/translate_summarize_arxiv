    "<S> the heisenberg s error - disturbance relation is a cornerstone of quantum physics . </S>",
    "<S> it was recently shown to be not universally valid and two different approaches to reformulate it were proposed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the first one focuses on how error and disturbance of two observables , a and b , depend on a particular quantum state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the second one asks how a joint measurement of a and b affects their eigenstates @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> previous experiments focused on the first approach @xcite . here , we focus on the second one . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , we propose and implement an extendible method for quantum walk - based joint measurements of noisy pauli operators to test the error - disturbance relation for qubits introduced in ref . @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then , we formulate and experimentally test a new universally valid relation for the three mutually unbiased observables . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore establish a fundamentally new method of testing error - disturbance relations .    </S>",
    "<S> the test of heisenberg s error - disturbance relation has been recently proposed @xcite and implemented @xcite and the observed violation became a subject of a heated debate @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the relation can be formulated as @xmath0 \\rangle$ ] , were @xmath1 is the measurement precision of an observable @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the disturbance that this measurement induces on another observable @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the violation stems from states for which measures of error and disturbance can be both zero @xmath5 , while at the same time the estimated lower bound on them is non - zero @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this motivates a state - independent approach @xcite in which the error - disturbance trade - off is evaluated for a set of states that `` calibrate '' the measurement apparatus @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , the idea of the state - independent approach @xcite is to test the measurement - disturbance tradeoff in a setup allowing for a joint measurement of both observables , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . in general </S>",
    "<S> , an exact measurement of @xmath2 and @xmath4 can not be performed if the two observables are incompatible . </S>",
    "<S> however , one can find another measurement procedure , let s call it @xmath6 , </S>",
    "<S> whose outcomes can be used to estimate @xmath7 and @xmath8 that are noisy versions of the original observables . the error - disturbance trade - off can be later evaluated by comparing the outcomes of @xmath7 and @xmath8 with the outcomes of @xmath2 and @xmath4 that were obtained in scenarios when the original observables were measured separately .     </S>",
    "<S> from which noisy versions of the two observables , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , can be estimated . </S>",
    "<S> the error - disturbance trade - off is evaluated by a comparison of the outcomes of @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) with the outcomes of @xmath2 ( @xmath4 ) when measured alone . ]        instead of using @xmath1 and @xmath3 it was proposed to measure the error - disturbance trade - off in terms of a distance @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> intuitively , @xmath9 measures how well @xmath7 approximates @xmath2 ( similar for @xmath4 and @xmath8 ) . </S>",
    "<S> next , it was shown in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that for @xmath11 qubit measurements the state - dependent distance is of the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the generalised measurement operator ( positive operator value measure  povm ) corresponding to the outcome @xmath16  for details see methods . </S>",
    "<S> the qubit povm operators can be expressed as @xmath17 and @xmath18 , therefore @xmath19 . in order to obtain state - independent distance one chooses @xmath20 to be a unit vector lying along @xmath21 and therefore @xmath22 . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath2 is a sharp observable then @xmath23 and @xmath24 is a unit vector . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , if we choose @xmath7 to be an unsharp version of @xmath2 such that @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the efficiency , then the distance is maximised for @xmath27 . using the above choice we can think of the measurement process as of `` calibration '' @xcite , since for such states the outcome of @xmath2 is known . in this case @xmath28 .    the heisenberg - type relation for qubit measurements that uses </S>",
    "<S> the distance approach is of the form @xcite @xmath29 the maximal value of the lower bound is @xmath30 and can be obtained for mutually unbiassed observables in which case @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the equality is achieved for @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , joint measurement of two unsharp unbiased observables is possible for @xmath33 @xcite .    in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it was proposed that povm measurements can be naturally implemented in a discrete - time quantum walk setup . </S>",
    "<S> this idea was recently experimentally verified @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such setup perfectly matches the joint - measurement requirements discussed above , since it naturally implements a measurement @xmath6 that allows to estimate @xmath7 and @xmath8 which are approximations of @xmath2 and @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , substantial control over the quantum walk parameters allows one to implement joint measurements of practically any pair of qubit measurements and even of a triple of qubit measurements .    </S>",
    "<S> a discrete - time quantum walk is a simple model of a single particle dynamics moving in a discrete space . here </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a simple case of a one - dimensional space @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the state of the particle is described by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the position and @xmath36 is a two - level degree of freedom known as a coin . in each step of the evolution </S>",
    "<S> the particle moves either to the left or right , depending on the state of the coin . </S>",
    "<S> this conditional translation is described by @xmath37 in addition , the coin degree of freedom also evolves according to @xmath38 in order to allow for a superposition of walking right and left at the same time . </S>",
    "<S> a single step of the evolution is given by @xmath39 and it can be considered as a standard von neumann measurement of the coin . if the walker moved to the right we know that the coin was initially in the state @xmath40 and if it moved to the left we know that the coin was in the state @xmath41 .    </S>",
    "<S> however , we can consider more than one step of the underlying quantum walk in which the operator @xmath6 can depend on time and position . </S>",
    "<S> this allows for a nontrivial engineering of correlations between the position and the coin . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the measurement of the particle s position constitutes a povm on a coin degree of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> then we construct the joint measurements of two and three observables based on quantum walk , and use our joint measurements to test the error - disturbance relation for qubits .    * experimental setup . </S>",
    "<S> * for the quantum walk setup we constructed , the position of the particle @xmath42 and the coin state @xmath43 are encoded in the longitudinal spatial modes and polarizations @xmath44 , @xmath45 of the single photons . </S>",
    "<S> the conditional translation operator @xmath46 is realized by the designed bd , that does not displace the vertical polarized photons ( @xmath47 ) but makes the horizontal polarized ones undergo a 4 mm lateral displacement ( @xmath48 ) . in the experiment , </S>",
    "<S> the input states are prepared by passing single photons through a bd ( the vertical polarized photons are blocked ) , a half - wave plate ( hwp ) and a quarter - wave plate ( qwp ) in a specific configuration . </S>",
    "<S> the detailed settings can be found in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] .    * experimental test of the busch - lahti - werner qubit relation . </S>",
    "<S> * we consider joint measurements of noisy pairs @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 . we aim to achieve the efficiency @xmath32 ( see supplementary information for detailed results ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we perform standard separate von neumann measurements of @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> this is necessary to evaluate the state - dependent and state - independent distances . </S>",

    "<S> is @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore confirm the validity of ( [ rel ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also observed that for specific states some pairs of state - dependent distances are small . </S>",
    "<S> for example , @xmath69 and @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> a similar effect lies at the root of the violation of state - dependent error - disturbance relations . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , this result confirms observations in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our measurement data also allows us to reconfirm some of the previous experimental results @xcite  see supplemental material .    * new relation for three unbiassed observables . </S>",
    "<S> * we propose a special scenario in which one can use state - dependent error - disturbance measures by adding an additional measurement to the relation . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we consider a trade - off relation between the three unbiased pauli observables . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the measurements span all three directions in the bloch - ball representation of the qubit and therefore the state of the system does not stand out from the parameter space described by the measurement .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a joint measurement of the three unsharp pauli observables @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , with the corresponding efficiencies @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , that approximate the original spin operators . </S>",
    "<S> for the state @xmath77 one has @xmath78 for derivation see  methods .    </S>",

    "<S> in particular , we focus on the case @xmath79 for which the three unsharp observables are jointly measurable if @xmath80 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we aim at @xmath81 .    , @xmath82 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> the theory values are shown as the star markers , and error bars are too small to identify . , height=377 ]    we obtained the following state - independent distances : @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical value for all three distances is @xmath86 . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath82 we obtained @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath56 we obtained @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , for @xmath57 we obtained @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 .    </S>",
    "<S> the above values can be plugged to relation ( [ rel2 ] ) , however due to experimental noise they do not saturate it . </S>",
    "<S> the relation is more interesting when tested for state @xmath96 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , to evaluate the lower bound we need to know the value of @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> although in principle the state was assumed to be pure , the actual value of @xmath100 can be evaluated from the average values of von neumann measurements @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> plugging all this to ( [ rel2 ] ) one gets @xmath102 .    </S>",
    "<S> to conclude , we report an experimental implementation of quantum walk - based joint measurements of noisy pauli operators . </S>",
    "<S> we use the optical setup in which the spatial modes of a single photon correspond to the walker s position and the polarisation plays the role of the coin . </S>",
    "<S> next , we use the outcomes from a joint measurement of two observables to test the error - disturbance relation for qubits introduced in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note , that the previous experiments testing error - disturbance relations were based on the weak - value method or the so - called three - state method @xcite and that the quantum walk based joint measurement method used by us is fundamentally different . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we propose a modified relation for three mutually unbiassed observables and test it using the outcomes from a joint measurement of all three pauli operators . </S>"
