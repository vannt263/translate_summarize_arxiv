    "although radial velocity planet surveys have mainly targeted main - sequence fgkm stars , there have also been numerous discoveries of jupiter - mass giant planets around evolved stars .",
    "these include moderately evolved subgiant stars , as well as very evolved giant stars .",
    "this work has provided evidence that the giant planet population around evolved stars differs from the population orbiting solar - type main - sequence stars , in at least three respects .",
    "first , there are fewer close - in giant planets ( `` hot jupiters '' ) around evolved stars than main - sequence stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "second , the orbital eccentricities of long - period giant planets are typically lower when the host star is evolved .",
    "third , a larger fraction of evolved stars appear to host long - period giant planets , although this comparison is more complicated because of the possibility of systematic metallicity differences between the samples of evolved stars and main - sequence stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the work described here was motivated by the desire to understand the first finding , the scarcity of hot jupiters around evolved stars .",
    "two conflicting interpretations have been proposed .",
    "the first possibility is that tidal evolution has destroyed the hot jupiters that once orbited the evolved stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the second possibility is that the evolved stars are on average more massive than the main - sequence stars , and the differences in the planet populations are linked to the enhanced stellar mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this picture",
    ", hot jupiters may occur less commonly around massive stars due to differences in ( for example ) the structure of the protoplanetary disk , or the disk dissipation timescale .    the latter scenario , attributing the differences to stellar mass , is generally favored in the literature .",
    "it is supported by the results of fitting stellar - evolutionary models to the observable properties of the evolved stars ( their luminosities , surface gravities , and effective temperatures ) , which confirm that the evolved stars are relatively massive .",
    "@xcite referred to their sample of evolved stars as `` retired a stars , '' because the evolutionary models assign these stars the same masses as main - sequence a5a9 stars ( 2.01.6  @xmath0 ) .",
    "recently , though , the fidelity of those evolutionary models was called into question by @xcite .",
    "he argued that the selection criteria that were used to define samples of evolved stars should have resulted in a sample dominated by lower - mass stars , with f- and g - type progenitors rather than a - type .",
    "the debate over this claim continues @xcite . in the meantime",
    ", it would be helpful to have a model - independent method for comparing the masses of the evolved stars and the main - sequence stars that have been included in radial velocity surveys .",
    "the observed galactic space motions ( kinematics ) of the stars can provide such a comparison .",
    "all of the stars under discussion are members of the thin disk of the milky way , and empirically it is known that the velocity dispersion of a thin - disk population increases with age ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is understood as follows .",
    "thin disk stars form from dense , turbulent gas in the galactic plane . because that process is highly dissipative , stellar populations are formed with a very cold velocity distribution . over time , the velocity distribution is heated due to interactions between the stars and molecular clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and transient spiral waves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "massive stars spend only a short time on the main sequence , and there is very little time for collisions to kinematically heat a population of massive stars . on the other hand ,",
    "solar - mass stars spend a long time on the main sequence , leaving plenty of time for collisions to kinematically heat a population of solar - mass stars .",
    "one would therefore expect a main - sequence thin - disk stellar population s space velocity dispersion to decrease with increasing stellar mass .",
    "the same is true even for evolved stars , because a star spends such a small fraction of its life as a subgiant or giant relative to its main - sequence lifetime .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the galactic velocity dispersion of the population of evolved planet - hosting stars .",
    "the kinematic evidence shows that these stars are similar in mass to f5g5 main - sequence stars .",
    "consequently , the lack of host jupiters around evolved stars can not be attributed to mass .",
    "the most plausible explanation is that the hot jupiters have been destroyed , after losing orbital angular momentum to their host stars .",
    "we describe our sample of planet - hosting stars in section 2 , we detail our analysis procedures in section 3 , we outline scaling relations for tidal evolution timescales in section 4 , we discuss the results and implications in section 5 , and we summarize our findings in section 6 .",
    "we first extract a list of exoplanet host stars identified with the doppler technique , using the online database ` exoplanets.org ` @xcite .",
    "we cross - match those stars with the hipparcos catalog @xcite to obtain parallaxes and @xmath1 colors , and with the tycho-2 catalog @xcite to obtain apparent @xmath2-band magnitudes .",
    "we transform the tycho-2 @xmath3 and @xmath4 magnitudes into approximate johnson - cousins @xmath2-band magnitudes using the relation @xmath5 .",
    "photometry for some of the brightest planet - hosting stars is missing from the @xcite catalog .",
    "for those cases we use the original tycho photometry given by @xcite .",
    "we remove from the list all planet - hosting stars with imprecise parallaxes ( fractional uncertainty exceeding 20% ) .",
    "we also obtain the nominal parameters of the host stars and their planets from ` exoplanets.org ` .",
    "we then define three samples of the planet - hosting stars .",
    "the sample of subgiants is defined as those stars with @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the sample of giants consists of stars with @xmath8 .",
    "finally , a sample of main - sequence f5g5 planet - hosting stars is defined by the criteria @xmath9 and @xmath10 , taken from @xcite .",
    "we will show later , based on kinematic evidence , that the typical mass of stars in the main - sequence f5g5 sample is similar to the typical mass of the stars in the subgiant and giant star samples .",
    "figure  [ fig01 ] is a hertzsprung - russell ( hr ) diagram of planet - hosting stars identified with the radial velocity technique , with our three subsamples highlighted .",
    "our samples are defined according to observable criteria in color and absolute magnitude , as opposed to model - dependent stellar masses ( i.e. , masses determined by comparing the observable properties with the outputs of theoretical stellar - evolutionary models ) .",
    "this is because the planet surveyors often define samples according to color and absolute magnitude , and because of the questionable reliability of the model - dependent stellar masses for the subgiants ( lloyd  2011 ) .",
    "nevertheless , one may wonder about the model - dependent masses that have been determined for the stars in our samples .",
    "for the subgiants , the model - dependent masses reported in the literature are in the range @xmath11@xmath12 , with all but six stars having @xmath13 .",
    "from this sample , none of the subsequent analyses are substantially affected . ]",
    "the giant stars have model - dependent masses reported to be in the range @xmath11@xmath14 , with all but 6 stars having @xmath13 .",
    "the reported model - dependent masses of the main - sequence f5g5 stars are in the range @xmath15@xmath16 .",
    "we also define two samples of main - sequence stars in the solar neighborhood ( not necessarily planet - hosting stars ) using the hipparcos catalog , requiring as before that the parallax uncertainty be smaller than 20% .",
    "the first sample consists of main - sequence stars with @xmath17 and @xmath18 , corresponding to a5f0 stars ( 21.5 @xmath19 ) according to @xcite .",
    "our intention with this sample is to provide a control sample that will allow a test of the hypothesis that the population of subgiant planet hosts is dominated by `` retired a stars '' .",
    "the second sample consists of main - sequence stars with @xmath20 and @xmath10 , corresponding to f5g5 stars ( 1.30.9 @xmath19 ) according to @xcite .",
    "we compute galactic @xmath21 velocities for all stars for which the systemic radial velocities are available in the catalogs of @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite .",
    "in addition to radial velocities , as inputs we use hipparcos astrometry , parallaxes , and proper motions @xcite .",
    "enough information is available to compute @xmath21 velocities for all 35 subgiants , 23 of 24 giant stars , and 88 of 91 main - sequence f5g5 stars .",
    "we use the algorithm given in ` gal_uvw.pro ` available from the idl astronomy user s library .",
    "we follow the convention that @xmath22 is positive towards the galactic center , @xmath2 is positive in the direction of galactic rotation , and @xmath23 is positive towards the north galactic pole .",
    "we do not correct for motion of the sun relative to the local standard of rest . for those interested in replicating the results ,",
    "a comparable data set is publicly available from e.mamajek .",
    "figure  [ fig02 ] compares the @xmath21 velocities of the subgiant planet - hosting stars , the solar - neighborhood a5f0 stars , and the solar - neighborhood f5g5 stars .",
    "as expected , the f5g5 stars have a much larger velocity dispersion than the a5f0 stars ; they are kinematically hotter .",
    "the subgiant planet - hosting stars are also seen to be kinematically hotter than the main - sequence a5f0 stars , with many stars outside of the 95% ellipse defined by the a5f0 population . on the other hand , the velocity dispersion of the subgiant planet - hosting stars is comparable to the velocity dispersion of the main - sequence f5g5 sample .    we quantify the significance of these observations in the following way .",
    "first , we calculate the mean @xmath21 velocities of the solar neighborhood main - sequence a5f0 and f5g5 samples .",
    "we denote these mean velocities by @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "we then compute @xmath27^{1/2 } % \\delta & = & \\sum_{i}^{n } \\delta_{i}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 are the individual @xmath21 velocity coordinates of a single star .",
    "we calculate @xmath31 for each star in the subgiant sample and @xmath32 for each star in the solar neighborhood a5f0 sample .",
    "we use the anderson - darling test ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to compare the sample of subgiant @xmath33 values to the sample of a5f0 @xmath34 values .",
    "we find the probability that the subgiant planet - hosting stars are drawn from the same parent distribution as solar - neighborhood a5f0 stars to be less than @xmath35 .",
    "then we repeat the same calculation after computing @xmath32 for each star in the solar neighborhood f5g5 sample .",
    "the result is that there is no reason to reject the hypothesis that the subgiant planet hosts and the f5g5 stars are drawn from the same population ( anderson - darling @xmath36-value @xmath37 ) .",
    "the @xmath21 space motions of the subgiant planet - hosting stars are incompatible with the hypothesis of recent evolution from a population of a5f0 main - sequence stars .",
    "their larger velocity dispersion requires that they experienced longer main - sequence lifetimes than the stars in the solar - neighborhood main - sequence a5f0 sample .",
    "this in turn implies that the subgiant planet - hosting stars are less massive than the main - sequence a5f0 stars .",
    "the agreement between the velocity dispersions of the subgiants and the solar - neighborhood main - sequence f5g5 sample indicates that these two samples likely have similar stellar masses . of being drawn from the same parent distribution .",
    "thus the typical mass of the subgiant planet hosts is also likely to be smaller than that of the f0f5 stars . ]",
    "this is at odds with the model - dependent masses for the subgiants , which are generally reported to be larger than than the masses of main - sequence f5g5 stars .",
    "while our sample - based test can not be used to establish the mass of any particular star , we note that there is only a very weak negative correlation ( @xmath38 ) between @xmath31 and the model - dependent mass .",
    "this correlation is not significantly different from zero given the sample size ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the correlation would have needed to be 0.3 or larger in absolute value to have established a genuine correlation at the @xmath40 level .",
    "figure  [ fig03 ] compares the @xmath21 velocities of the giant planet - hosting stars with the solar - neighborhood main - sequence stars .",
    "the @xmath21 velocity dispersion of the giants is also inconsistent with solar - neighborhood main - sequence a5f0 sample ( anderson - darling @xmath41 ) . and just as with the subgiants , their velocity dispersion is indistinguishable from the solar - neighborhood main - sequence f5g5 sample ( anderson - darling @xmath42 ) . we conclude that the planet - hosting giant stars , like the subgiants , are on average similar in mass to the main - sequence f5g5 planet hosts .",
    "one of the planet - hosting giants , @xmath43 geminorum ( pollux ) happens to have a asteroseismic mass determination placing it firmly in the `` retired a star '' category , with @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "reassuringly , we find that this star has a @xmath21 velocity of @xmath45 km s@xmath46 , placing it just outside of the 68% contour of the solar - neighborhood main - sequence a5f0 sample .",
    "therefore this particular star has a low space velocity as expected , and does not call into question the overall result that the sample of planet - hosting giants is dominated by lower - mass stars .",
    "figure  [ fig04 ] compares the @xmath21 velocities of the planet - hosting f5g5 stars , and of the solar - neighborhood samples .",
    "as expected , we find that the main - sequence f5g5 planet - hosting stars are kinematically hotter than the solar - neighborhood a5f0 stars , and they are kinematically indistinguishable from the solar - neighborhood main - sequence f5g5 sample .    figures  [ fig02 ] ,  [ fig03 ] , and  [ fig04 ] indicate that on average the subgiant planet - hosting stars are similar in mass to the main - sequence f5g5 planet hosts .",
    "however it is possible that some fraction of the subgiant planet hosts stars are indeed more massive than the f5g5 planet hosts . to quantify the maximum fraction of massive stars that could be present in the subgiant sample , we use a monte carlo simulation .",
    "we create many random mixed control samples composed of both solar neighborhood main - sequence a5f0 and f5g5 stars .",
    "we vary the fraction of main - sequence a5f0 stars and then compare the velocity dispersion of the subgiant sample to the resultant mixed control samples .",
    "we find that control samples including less than @xmath47 main sequence a5f0 stars are generally consistent with the subgiant sample .",
    "consequently , we expect that no more than 40% of the subgiant planet hosts were once a5f0 stars .",
    "based on a similar calculation , we also find that no more than 40% of the stars in the giant sample were once a5f0 stars .",
    "we perform a few additional tests of the claim that the subgiants that were selected for the doppler planet surveys have a typical mass similar to that of f5g5 stars .",
    "first , we repeated the comparisons after swapping the subgiant planet - hosting sample for the sample of southern sky subgiants from the pan - pacific planet search presented by @xcite .",
    "these are not necessarily planet - hosting stars , but they were selected for doppler surveillance in a similar fashion as the other subgiant planet hosts .",
    "we obtain quantitatively similar results ; the pan - pacific search targets are kinematically better matched to f5g5 stars than to more massive stars .",
    "second , we select subgiant stars from the hipparcos catalog using the same color and magnitude criteria that we applied to select the planet - hosting subgiant sample .",
    "this is intended to mimic the parent population of subgiants from which the planet - hosting stars were identified by the doppler surveyors .",
    "we find that their kinematics are indistinguishable from the kinematics of the planet - hosting subgiants ( anderson - darling @xmath36-value @xmath48 ) .",
    "we also find the hipparcos subgiant sample to be kinematically incompatible with an origin in the same parent population as the hipparcos main sequence a5f0 sample ( anderson - darling @xmath36-value @xmath49 ) .",
    "in contrast , the subgiant planet hosts and the main - sequence f5-g5 planet hosts are kinematically consistent with an origin in the same parent population ( anderson - darling @xmath36-value @xmath50 ) .",
    "the masses of the subgiant planet - hosting stars are now seen to be similar to those of the main - sequence f5g5 planet - hosting stars .",
    "one may wonder , though , if there are systematic differences in other stellar parameters that may have affected their planet populations .",
    "a key parameter is metallicity , which is well known to have a major influence on the properties of giant planets @xcite .",
    "thus it is important to compare the metallicities of the two samples .",
    "based on the metallicity determinations reported in the literature , we find the average metallicity of the main - sequence sample ( [ fe / h ] @xmath51 ) to overlap with the average metallicity of the subgiant sample ( [ fe / h ] @xmath52 ) .",
    "their distributions are consistent with being drawn from the same parent distribution ( anderson - darling @xmath36-value @xmath53 ) .",
    "thus at face value the metallicity distributions appear to be equivalent , although in section 5.3 we discuss the possibility of systematic biases in the reported metallicity values .",
    "the radial velocity surveys are complete for planets with velocity semiamplitude @xmath54 m s@xmath46 and orbital distance @xmath55  au , corresponding to orbital period @xmath56  yr @xcite .",
    "we therefore focus attention on the population of known planets satisfying these criteria . in figure  [ fig05 ]",
    "we plot the @xmath57@xmath58 and @xmath57@xmath59 distributions for the giant planets with @xmath54 m s@xmath46 and @xmath60  au , for all three samples of planet - hosting stars .",
    "the planets orbiting both samples of evolved stars ( subgiants and giants ) mainly have periods longer than 100 days .",
    "only one subgiant has a planet with a shorter period , in strong contrast to the main - sequence stars which frequently host short - period planets .",
    "furthermore the planets around the evolved stars are preferentially on circular orbits , compared to the more eccentric orbits commonly seen for the planets around main - sequence f5g5 stars .",
    "the mean eccentricities of the planets around subgiants , giants , and main - sequence stars are @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "the eccentricity distributions for planets around subgiants , and for planets around giants , are consistent with each other ( anderson - darling @xmath36-value @xmath53 ) .",
    "however the probability that the eccentricities of the planets around subgiants are drawn from the same parent distribution as the main - sequence sample is less than @xmath35 . in the next section",
    "we will examine the hypothesis that tidal evolution is responsible for these differences in the planet populations .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig05 ] also shows that the planets orbiting subgiants are clustered at low velocity semiamplitudes @xmath64 m s@xmath46 , relative to the planets around main - sequence stars .",
    "this is despite the fact that planets with larger @xmath59 values would have been more easily detected .",
    "the probability that the @xmath59 distributions of planets around subgiants and main - sequence stars are drawn from the same parent distribution is less than @xmath35 .",
    "one finding that is not illustrated in figure  [ fig05 ] is that the evolved stars are more likely than the main - sequence stars to show evidence for additional longer - period companions , in the form of a long - term radial - velocity trend . at @xmath65  days ,",
    "long - term radial - velocity trends occur around 9 of 34 subgiants .",
    "in contrast , long - term trends occur in only 2 of 33 main - sequence stars ( with giant planets in the complete region of parameter space ) and in only 1 out of 24 giant stars .",
    "if the distribution of long - term trends were the same for subgiants as for main - sequence stars , the chance of reproducing these numbers would be less than 1 in 40,000 .",
    "if the subgiant planet - hosting stars and the main - sequence f5g5 planet - hosting stars have similar kinematics and metallicities , the differences between their planet populations are not easily attributed to differences in mass or composition . instead",
    ", the observed differences in planet populations are likely to be related to age or stellar radius ( which are , of course , correlated ) . a mechanism for altering planetary systems that is known to depend sensitively on stellar radius is tidal dissipation .",
    "theoretical rates of energy dissipation due to star - planet tidal interactions scale as high powers of the stellar radius ( @xmath66 in the works cited below ) . in this section",
    "we develop approximate formulas for tidal dissipation rates , to support the discussion in the next section .",
    "tidal interactions between a star and an orbiting planet allow for the exchange of angular momentum between the bodies while steadily draining energy from the system @xcite .",
    "if the star s rotation period is longer than the planet s orbital period , the star spins up and the orbit shrinks . if the total angular momentum of the system exceeds a critical value , the orbit eventually circularizes and the bodies spins are synchronized and aligned . if however the total angular momentum is too small , then there is no stable equilibrium : the orbit keeps shrinking until the planet is destroyed .",
    "it is not yet possible to compute accurate dissipation timescales from first principles .",
    "the best that can be done is to establish plausible scaling relationships that are calibrated using observations , as we attempt here .",
    "eccentricity damping ( orbit circularization ) can occur either due to dissipation inside of the planet or inside of the star .",
    "the timescales for eccentricity damping due to dissipation inside of the planet @xmath67 , due to dissipation inside of the star @xmath68 , and their ratio are ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath69    where @xmath57 is the orbital period , @xmath70 is the orbital semimajor axis , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the tidal quality factors of the planet and star , @xmath73 and @xmath74 are their tidal love numbers , @xmath75 and @xmath76 are their masses , and @xmath77 and @xmath78 are their radii . assuming constant @xmath71 , @xmath73 , @xmath75 , @xmath77 , and @xmath76 , the scaling relations for the timescale for orbit circularization due to dissipation inside of the planet and inside of its host star are @xmath79    it is commonly understood that for main - sequence stars with planets , orbital circularization is mainly due to dissipation within the planet .",
    "this is because the usual assumptions @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 lead to @xmath86 .",
    "we use this fact to provide a rough calibration for the dissipation timescale .",
    "figure  [ fig05 ] shows that planets orbiting main - sequence stars inside of @xmath87 days are on nearly circular orbits , while planets orbiting outside of @xmath88 days are frequently on eccentric orbits .",
    "the timescale for orbit circularization in the shorter - period systems must be significantly shorter than the ages of the systems .",
    "we will therefore assume that the circularization timescale @xmath89 at @xmath90 days for a solar - mass star with @xmath91 and a planet with the mass and radius of jupiter and @xmath81 is @xmath92 gyr .",
    "when the host star is a subgiant with @xmath93 , then @xmath94 and circularization should be mainly due to dissipation inside of the star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "using equations  ( [ eq : ratio - tau ] ) , ( [ eq : ratio - planet ] ) , and ( [ eq : ratio - star ] ) plus the calibration presented above we may write @xmath95    where @xmath96    then , taking the overall eccentricity - damping timescale @xmath97 to be the smaller of the two dissipation timescales ( inside the planet or inside the star ) , we have @xmath98    as for tidal evolution of the orbital distance @xmath70 , the scaling relation is thought to be ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath99    figure  [ fig05 ] shows that there are many planets orbiting main sequence stars at @xmath100 days , but few at @xmath101 day . assuming this difference to reflect the tidal decay of the shortest - period orbits leads to a rough calibration of the tidal decay timescales .",
    "if we assume that the timescale for orbital drift @xmath102 of a @xmath103 planet orbiting at @xmath104 days a @xmath91 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 host star is @xmath107 gyr , then we have @xmath108    equations ( [ eq : tau - circ ] ) and ( [ eq : tau - a ] ) were used to calculate @xmath97 and @xmath109 as a function of orbital period and stellar radius , for a fiducial solar - mass star with a jovian planet .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig06 ] , which also displays the periods and stellar radii of the various samples of exoplanet systems considered in this paper .",
    "the stellar radii are based on the empirical calibration given by @xcite .",
    "there are two other criteria that must be satisfied for tidal decay .",
    "first , since tides only cause orbital decay if the stellar rotation period is longer than the orbital period , we indicate in figure  [ fig06 ] the maximum stellar rotation period that would be expected for stars in the different samples .",
    "these are based on the observed projected rotation rates ( @xmath110 ) and estimated radii of the planet host stars , using @xmath111    the upper limit on @xmath112 was computed for each star .",
    "then , the median of these upper limits was computed for each sample , and plotted in the left panel of figure  [ fig06 ] .",
    "second , the total angular momentum of the system @xmath113 must be lower than the critical value @xmath114 necessary for a stable equilibrium ( in which the star and planet have achieved spin  orbit synchronization and alignment ) .",
    "the total angular momentum can be written @xmath115^{1/2 } , \\\\",

    "here @xmath118 and @xmath119 are the radii of gyration of star and planet , assuming the solar and jovian values respectively .",
    "likewise , @xmath120 and @xmath121 are the angular velocities of star and planet .",
    "the rotational angular momentum of the planet is negligible .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath122^{1/4},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "assuming @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath93 , and @xmath85 characteristic of an evolved star with a giant planet , then all systems with @xmath125 , or approximately @xmath126 , are tidally unstable .",
    "such planets will ultimately be engulfed , if the host star s rotational angular momentum was initially comparable to the current solar value .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig06 ] shows that there is no difficulty explaining the lack of hot jupiters around subgiants with periods between 1 and 10 days .",
    "although such planets orbits may be stable for a hubble time around a main - sequence stars , once the host star evolves and reaches a radius of @xmath127 , tidal dissipation rates increase by a factor of @xmath128 .",
    "those same planets would experience orbital decay in a few 100 myr , comparable to the time that their host stars spend as subgiants ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "tidal destruction has already been noted as a theoretical possibility by @xcite and @xcite , at least for giant stars with @xmath129 .",
    "it has also been suggested by @xcite , among others .",
    "now that the subgiants are seen to have similar masses as the main - sequence sample , tidal destruction seems to be the inevitable explanation for the lack of close - in giant planets orbiting subgiants relative to main - sequence stars .",
    "one might wonder if it is possible to find additional supporting evidence for tidal destruction of hot jupiters based on the observed rotation rates of subgiants , since the accretion of angular momentum from a disrupted giant planet could affect the rotation rate .",
    "suppose a star with mass @xmath130 , radius @xmath131 , radius of gyration @xmath132 ( the solar value ) , and rotation period @xmath133 d accretes a 1 @xmath134 planet initially orbiting at 0.1 au , and absorbs all of its orbital angular momentum . the final rotation period of that star when it reaches @xmath93 would be 24 days . had it not absorbed its planet s orbital angular momentum , then its rotational period would have been 130 days .",
    "this seems like a significant difference .",
    "however , the radii of subgiants are generally uncertain by a factor of two or more .",
    "if instead the subgiant had a radius of @xmath135 , then its rotation period after absorbing its planet s orbital angular momentum would be 94 days .",
    "consequently , identifying angular momentum enhancement in evolved stars will be difficult without accurate stellar radii .",
    "the accretion of metal - enriched material from a disrupted giant planet could also affect the observed chemical abundances of an evolved star .",
    "indeed , the accretion of solid material was initially considered as one possible explanation for the enhanced metallicity of the solar - type stars identified as giant planet hosts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "following the calculation by @xcite , the accretion of a jupiter - mass planet with @xmath136 into the @xmath137 convective envelope of an evolved solar metallicity star will only increase the star s observed metallicity by 0.01 dex  an imperceptibly small increase .",
    "although tidal destruction is a natural explanation for the lack of hot jupiters around subgiants , the relative scarcity of giant planets with periods between 10 and 100 days can not be explained as the consequence of tidal destruction unless the tidal dissipation rate for subgiants is 3 - 4 orders of magnitude faster than estimated in the previous section ( and plotted in figure  [ fig06 ] ) .",
    "one possibility is that dissipation becomes faster not only because of an enlarged stellar radius , but also a decrease in @xmath138 due to the changing stellar structure .",
    "this could also explain the observation that the shortest - period planets seen around subgiants ( @xmath139 days ) tend to have circular orbits : such planets would be undergoing tidal eccentricity damping due to dissipation within the host star .",
    "this is in contrast to the hot jupiters observed around main - sequence stars , for which dissipation within the planet is likely to be the primary cause of eccentricity damping .",
    "furthermore it would not be surprising for a subgiant to have a lower @xmath138 than a main - sequence star .",
    "the strength of tidal evolution in evolved stars is thought to depend on the mass of their convective envelopes @xcite , and the mass in the convective envelope of a solar - type star increases by an order of magnitude as a subgiant between the main sequence turnoff and the base of the red giant branch @xcite .",
    "we digress momentarily to point out that figure  [ fig01 ] reveals that most of the _ giant _ planet - hosting stars ( as opposed to subgiants ) are concentrated in the so - called `` red clump ''  a region of the hr diagram where the red giant branch overlaps with the horizontal branch for a solar - metallicity stellar population . without asteroseismic observations ,",
    "we can not confidently assign individual stars to one or the other of those two populations .",
    "unfortunately this means the giants are less useful than the subgiants in understanding the tidal evolution of planetary systems , for the following reason .",
    "the stars on the horizontal branch are currently burning helium in their cores after an initial ascent up the giant branch .",
    "they very likely had larger radii at the tip of the red giant branch than they currently possess .",
    "since tidal effects depend strongly on stellar radius , the tidal evolution of any close - in exoplanets depends strongly on the sizes of the giant stars at the tip of the red giant branch  which are unobserved and poorly constrained .",
    "the subgiants invite a more straightforward interpretation , since they are presently as large as they have ever been since the planet - formation epoch .",
    "putting these pieces together , a scenario that explains many of our observations is as follows .",
    "stars become more dissipative as they evolve off of the main sequence , both because the stellar radius increases and also because @xmath138 decreases by 3 - 4 orders of magnitude .",
    "consequently , planets orbiting inside of the corotation radius ( @xmath140 days ) lose angular momentum relatively quickly through tidal interactions .",
    "planets just outside of corotation are pushed out and pile up at @xmath139 days , while also undergoing eccentricity damping .",
    "extending this scenario to the giant stars is also possible .",
    "as the host stars continue to move up the red giant branch , they expand and their rotation slows . as a consequence , the corotation radius is enlarged .",
    "those planets that were previously secure at @xmath139 days now find themselves losing orbital angular momentum .",
    "these planets are not necessarily destroyed , though , because the host stars trip up the red giant branch is brief .",
    "the orbital distances may shrink only modestly before the host stars start burning helium in their cores , contract , and settle onto the horizontal branch .",
    "some of the observed differences between the planet populations around subgiants and main - sequence stars have no obvious interpretation in terms of tidal interactions .",
    "first , there is no simple explanation for the higher occurrence rate of long - period giant planets around subgiant stars . according to @xcite ,",
    "the occurrence rate of giant planets with @xmath141 au is @xmath142% as compared to 510% for main - sequence stars .",
    "more recently , @xcite accounted for the effect of metallicity on planet occurrence and determined that the occurrence rate of giant planets with @xmath143 au is @xmath144% for subgiants , as compared to @xmath145% for main - sequence stars . in either case , these offsets represent a 2 - 3@xmath146 difference .",
    "a second and related point is that tides can not explain the higher incidence of velocity trends noted at the end of section  [ sec : orbital ] .",
    "tides are too weak to affect planets with such long periods that they are observed only as linear trends in a subgiant s radial velocity curve .",
    "third , and most puzzling , is the clustering of @xmath59 values between 1050 m  s@xmath46 for the subgiants , as compared to the broader distributions 10300 m  s@xmath46 for planets in the same period range around both main - sequence stars and giants .",
    "the timescale for tidal evolution is proportional to planet mass , raising the possibility that only low - mass planets ( small @xmath59 values ) persist once a star evolves off of the main sequence .",
    "but any tidal explanation would struggle to explain why the giant stars ( which are even more evolved than subgiants ) still harbor more massive planets .",
    "future work is needed to understand these three differences .",
    "one possibility is that the average metallicity of the stars in the subgiant sample is higher than that of the main - sequence sample , despite the comparison made in section  [ sec : metallicities ] suggesting that the metallicities are similar .",
    "giant planet occurrence rates are known to be strongly dependent on host star metallicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular @xcite found that the probability of giant planet occurrence @xmath147 scales as @xmath148}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in that case , the increased planet occurrence rate for subgiants reported by @xcite could be explained by a residual systematic metallicity offset of @xmath149 dex in [ fe / h ] . at the @xmath150 limits of the @xcite occurrence rates , even a residual offset as small as @xmath151 dex in [ fe / h ] could explain the apparently larger occurrence rate of giant planets in the subgiant sample .",
    "such an offset does not seem out of the question .",
    "the metallicities of the subgiants and many fg planet host stars in the control sample have been measured with the spectroscopy made easy package ( sme ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and other similar spectral - fitting codes .",
    "the metallicity values returned by sme are known to have systematic biases depending on effective temperature @xmath152 ( e.g. , section 6.4 of * ? ? ?",
    "although @xcite attempt to correct for this bias , perhaps there still exists a residual offset of 0.1  dex in [ fe / h ] when comparing the main - sequence f5g5 sample ( @xmath153  k ) to the subgiant sample ( @xmath1545000  k ) .",
    "indeed , strong correlations between the values of @xmath152 and [ fe / h ] generated by sme were recently identified by @xcite , who demonstrated that sme reports cooler temperatures ( 100  k ) and higher metallicities ( 0.1  dex ) than a line - by - line moog - like analysis @xcite .",
    "a homogeneous moog - like line - by - line stellar parameter analysis of a large sample of both fgk dwarf and subgiant planet - host stars might help to resolve this issue .",
    "we also note that in calculating the dependence of giant planet occurrence rates on stellar mass and metallicity , @xcite assumed that the effects of mass and metallicity were separable , even though there is a significant positive correlation between the reported stellar masses and metallicities ( see their figure 2 ) .",
    "as we have shown , the subgiant stars are not likely to be especially massive . as a result , some of the increased planet occurrence signal in the subgiant sample was likely misattributed to mass instead of metallicity .",
    "for that reason , the metallicity corrections necessary to directly compare the giant planet incidence rate of main - sequence fgk dwarfs and subgiants may have been underestimated by @xcite .",
    "more speculative is the possibility raised by @xcite that some of the radial - velocity signals detected for subgiant stars do not represent planets , but rather stellar oscillations .",
    "the oscillations would need to be nonradial to avoid producing large brightness variations in contradiction with the observations .",
    "nonradial oscillations can produce low - amplitude , sinusoidal radial velocity variations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though usually with smaller amplitudes and shorter periods . to our knowledge",
    "nonradial oscillations of subgiants producing signals as large as tens of m s@xmath46 with periods of hundreds of days have never been empirically established , nor have they been theoretically predicted .",
    "we note , though , that the literature does contain examples of similar quasi - sinusoidal variations that are at least suspected to be the result of nonradial oscillations , in both more evolved and less evolved stars @xcite .",
    "perhaps the intense scrutiny of the subgiants by the doppler surveyors has revealed a new mode of stellar pulsation .",
    "in addition to bringing the occurrence rate of giant planets around subgiants into better agreement with the main - sequence stars , this might help to explain the clustering of @xmath59 values .",
    "the physics of the hypothetical pulsations might naturally select a particular range of velocities , whereas the planet - induced velocity amplitudes would depend on three different independent variables ( @xmath75 , @xmath155 , and @xmath57 ) and should combine to produce a wide range of @xmath59 values .",
    "one might also wonder if stellar mass loss contributes to the orbital evolution of planets around subgiant stars , in addition to tidal effects .",
    "mass loss on the red giant branch is frequently parametrized using the reimers relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath156    where @xmath157 , @xmath78 , and @xmath76 are the stellar luminosity , radius , and mass in solar units .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath158 is in the range @xmath159 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and frequently set to @xmath160 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "taking the median luminosity , radius , and isochrone mass of our subgiant planet host sample @xmath161 , @xmath162 , and @xmath163 , the expected mass loss is rate is @xmath164  yr@xmath46 . over the 500 myr a solar - type star spends as a subgiant ,",
    "the total mass lost is only @xmath165 .",
    "thus , mass loss is unlikely to affect the orbital evolution of close - in giant planets orbiting subgiants or stars at the base of the red giant branch .",
    "subgiant stars are observed to host fewer close - in giant planets than main - sequence stars , but have a systematically higher giant planet occurrence rate when integrated over all periods .",
    "these differences have been attributed to the increased mass of the subgiant planet hosts relative to main - sequence planet hosts .",
    "we find that the galactic kinematics of subgiant stars that host giant planets demand that on average they be similar in mass to solar - type main - sequence planet - hosting stars .",
    "therefore , the best explanation for the lack of hot jupiters around evolved stars is tidal destruction of the hot jupiters they once possessed .",
    "if tidal dissipation inside their host stars is also responsible for circularizing the orbits of the giant planets orbiting subgiants at @xmath139 days , then tides should also have been strong enough to destroy any giant planets inside of corotation ( @xmath166 days ) .",
    "planets outside of corotation may have extracted angular momentum from their host stars and moved to longer orbital periods , explaining the sudden appearance of planets around subgiant stars at @xmath139 days .",
    "the apparent 2 - 3@xmath146 increase in the incidence of long - period giant planets around subgiant stars relative to main - sequence stars is difficult to explain",
    ". it may be the result of systematic underestimates of the metallicities of subgiant stars or ( more speculatively ) hitherto unknown modes of stellar pulsation among the subgiants that masquerade as long - period giant planets .",
    "it is also important to note that the kinematic equivalence of the subgiant and main - sequence samples suggests that the theoretical stellar - evolutionary models that were used to infer larger masses for the subgiants need to be re - evaluated . in particular , as suggested by @xcite it may be necessary to reassess the applicability of a mixing - length model of convection that is calibrated for the sun to low surface gravity stars that are not even quasi - stationary and that are developing shells of superadiabatic convection ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    there are also potentially important implications of our suggestion that stars become much more dissipative as they evolve off of the main sequence , such that @xmath167 .",
    "if this is so , then the earth will very likely be destroyed as the sun expands to nearly 100 times its current size near the tip of the red giant branch .",
    "previously it was thought that the orbital evolution of the earth could not even be predicted qualitatively as it seemed to depend on the details of the sun s mass loss on the giant branch ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus the subgiant planet searches may have  quite unexpectedly  clarified the earth s ultimate fate .",
