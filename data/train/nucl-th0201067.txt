    "in this paper we review the work of our groups on the application of the vlasov kinetic equation to small - amplitude density vibrations in _ finite _ fermi systems .",
    "the phenomenology that is described by this approach includes giant resonances in nuclei , surface plasmons in atomic clusters and possible collective excitations of the electrons in heavy atoms ( which however turned out not to be really collective ) . in the approach of jeans @xcite , vlasov @xcite and landau @xcite",
    "the theory has been developed for infinite homogeneous systems , later kirzhnitz _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite extended it to non - uniform systems .",
    "the quantity that is studied in this approach is the phase - space density ( or single - particle distribution ) @xmath0 .",
    "this quantity , when multiplied by the phase space volume @xmath1 gives the number of particles contained in that volume and has several useful properties since its knowledge allows us to obtain information about macroscopic properties of the system like , for example , the ordinary density [ rho ] ( * r*,t)=d*p*f(*r*,*p*,t ) , or the pressure tensor [ pre ] _ jk ( * r*,t)=d*p*p_jv_kf(*r*,*p*,t ) .",
    "we limit our interest to small oscillations of @xmath0 about its equilibrium value @xmath2 , which is supposed to describe the stationary state of the many - body system .",
    "if the system is subject to a weak external driving potential @xmath3 , then @xmath4 is changed by the small amount @xmath5 , consequently the local equilibrium density also changes by [ delrhotot ] ( * r*,t)=d*p*f(*r*,*p*,t ) , and the equilibrium mean field @xmath6 by [ dev ] v(*r*,t)=d*r*v(*r*,*r* ) ( * r*,t ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath7 is the effective interaction between two constituents of the many - body system .",
    "we shall consider only quantities at first order in @xmath8 , moreover the equilibrium distribution will be assumed to depend only on the energy of the particles : @xmath9 , where h_0(*r*,*p*)=+v_0(*r * ) is the equilibrium hamiltonian .    in a fully self - consistent approach the equilibrium mean field should be given by [ mfi ] v_0(*r*)=d*r*v(*r*,*r* ) d*p*f_0(*r*,*p * ) , however we shall use phenomenological approximations to it .",
    "there are two kinds of self - consistency requirements : the static self - consistency expressed by eq .",
    "( [ mfi ] ) , and the analogous dynamic self - consistency condition ( [ dev ] ) .",
    "we shall treat the static self - consistency condition more loosely , but will respect the dynamic condition ( [ dev ] ) because it is essential in the description of collective modes .",
    "the following differential equation for @xmath0 was considered by a.a .",
    "vlasov in a study of plasma oscillations @xcite : [ kin ] + -()=0 , together with the poisson equation ] [ poi ] ^2 v=-4e^2 .",
    "because of eq.([rho ] ) , equations ( [ kin ] ) and ( [ poi ] ) form a set of coupled equations that can be solved self - consistently .",
    "thus the kinetic equation ( [ kin ] ) , supplemented by ( [ poi ] ) , can be considered as a dynamical generalization of the static thomas - fermi method .",
    "althogh eq.([kin ] ) is a simplified version of an equation already derived by boltzmann and the idea of self - consistency in connection with it had already been used by jeans ( see @xcite for a discussion of hystorical priorities ) , we follow the use common both in plasma and in nuclear physics , and refer to eq.([kin ] ) as  the vlasov equation  .",
    "the work of vlasov was criticized by landau @xcite who pointed out some mathematical inconsistencies in vlasov s solution and derived a rigorous solution of eqs .",
    "( [ kin]-[poi ] ) for plasma oscillations .    in his later work on fermi liquids @xcite landau obtained a kinetic equation similar to eq.([kin ] ) ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite , p.18 ) and used it to study the propagation of zero sound in liquid helium .",
    "vlasov and landau were interested in macroscopic systems , so they did not worry about surface effects ; in their approach the system is supposed to be homogeneous and infinite , so that translation invariance considerably simplifies calculations .",
    "extension of their approach to microscopic systems like atoms @xcite or nuclei @xcite , apart from giving up translation invariance , has to face the non - trivial problem of deciding which boundary conditions are most appropriate for the fluctuations of the single - particle distribution @xmath10 .",
    "kirzhnitz and collaborators @xcite based their search for possible collective excitations of the electron cloud in heavy atoms on the linearized vlasov equation .",
    "the main results of their work can be summarized in the two following equations for the polarization propagator : [ rpa ] & & ( * r*,*r*,)=^0(*r*,*r* , ) + & & + d*x*d*y*^0(*r*,*x * , ) v(*x*,*y*)(*y*,*r* , ) , and [ pi0 ] & & ^0(*r*,*r*,)=-(*r*-*r* ) + & & + i_-^0 dt e^-it<(*r*(t)-*r* ) > ) .",
    "the propagator @xmath11 relates the ( fourier transformed in time ) external disturbance at point @xmath12 to the density response at point @xmath13 : [ pol ] ( * r*,)=d * r*(*r*,*r* , ) v_ext(*r* , ) , while @xmath14 is the same propagator evaluated in the static mean field , that is , by neglecting the mean - field fluctuation induced by the external force . the most interesting part in the expression ( [ pi0 ] ) is the time integral .",
    "the quantity @xmath15 in the integrand is the coordinate of a particle that , at time @xmath16 is at point @xmath13 and that moves in the static mean field according to the laws of classical physics .",
    "the @xmath17-function in the integrand contributes to the integral whenever @xmath18 , that is whenever a particle in @xmath13 at @xmath16 has been through @xmath12 at some earlier time .",
    "the symbol @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ pi0 ] ) means averaging over the directions of the particle velocity at @xmath16 , which requires that all the possible classical trajectories going from @xmath20 to @xmath13 are taken into account when evaluating @xmath14 . in fig .",
    "1 we give a schematic picture of a few classical orbits contributing to the time integral in eq .",
    "( [ pi0 ] ) .",
    "bertsch @xcite used the vlasov equation as a starting point for a theory of giant resonances in nuclei .",
    "he pointed out that , since the vlasov dynamics preserves the density of points in phase space , it does not violate the pauli principle , even if it is a completely classical theory .",
    "thus , eq.([kin ] ) , after having been used by jeans for stellar systems , by vlasov and landau for plasmas , by landau for liquid helium and by kirzhnitz _",
    "_ for atoms , found its way into nuclear physics as well .",
    "the expression ( [ pi0 ] ) for @xmath21 is quite general and in principle it is valid also for systems in which the motion of particles in the equilibrium mean field is chaotic , however it is not really suitable for practical calculations since evaluating the time integral requires following the particle trajectories over an infinite time interval .",
    "_ avoided this difficulty by restricting themselves to systems in which the particle motion is periodic , but this is a very severe limitation . in the more recent work of brink _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite it has been shown that there is an important class of finite systems for which the solution of the linearized vlasov equation acquires a relatively simple form : they are all the systems for which the motion of particles in the equilibrium mean field can be described by an integrable hamiltonian , this includes for example all spherically symmetric systems , but also some deformed systems . in these systems",
    "the particle motion is multiply periodic and , as a consequence , it is sufficient to follow the particle motion only over a finite time interval .",
    "the crucial step in applying the approach of @xcite to integrable systems , is an appropriate change of variables .",
    "the @xmath22 variables are convenient for translation - invariant systems , since in that case @xmath23 and the linearized version of eq .",
    "( [ kin ] ) becomes simpler .",
    "a similar simplification can be obtained for integrable systems if action - angle variables @xmath24 are used instead of @xmath25 . for these systems the action variables @xmath26 are constants of the motion , while the conjugate angle variables @xmath27 are linear functions of time ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite , p. 457 ) .",
    "an important property of these variables is that the motion is periodic in the angle variables with period @xmath28 .",
    "consequently the field felt by a particle that is moving along such a trajectory can be fourier expanded as [ fou1 ] v_ext(*r*,)=()_*n*q_*n*(*i * ) e^i*n * , where @xmath29 is a three - dimensional vector with integer components .",
    "similar expansions hold also for the fluctuations of the mean field [ fou2 ] v(*r*,)=_*n*v_*n*(*i * , ) e^i*n * and of the distribution function [ fou3 ] f(*r*,*p*,)=_*n*f_*n*(*i * , ) e^i*n*.    when eq.([kin ] ) is fourier transformed in time and linearized by neglecting terms of order @xmath30 and higher , it reads [ lki1 ] & & -if()+\\{f , h_0 } + & & + f(h_0)\\{h_0,[v^ext()+v()]}=0 . here",
    "the braces denote poisson brackets , that can be evaluated according to any set of canonically conjugate variables , using @xmath31 and @xmath32 gives the linearized version of eq.([kin ] ) , while using @xmath33 and @xmath34 gives [ lki2 ] & & -if()+ = + & & f(h_0)+ .",
    "the three components of the vector @xmath35 determine the time - dependence of the angle variables : _",
    "= = _ , while , of course i_=-=0 , and @xmath36 .    by using the expansions ( [ fou1]-[fou3 ] ) , eq.([lki2 ] ) gives [ sol ] & & f_*n*(*i*,)=f(h_0 ) . we have added a vanishingly small positive imaginary part @xmath37 in order to specify the behaviour of @xmath38 at the pole .",
    "equation ( [ sol ] ) gives an explicit solution of the linearized vlasov equation only if the fluctuation of the mean field @xmath39 can be neglected , otherwise it gives only an implicit solution , since @xmath39 does depend on @xmath8 ; however its form immediately suggests an iterative procedure for obtaining the full solution : first evaluate @xmath40 by neglecting @xmath39 in ( [ sol ] ) , then evaluate @xmath39 by using @xmath41 as input and repeat until convergence is obtained .",
    "the quantity @xmath8 is not very convenient for discussing the solution of the linearized vlasov equation , since it depends on the external driving force , so it is appropriate to introduce the polarization propagators ( [ rpa ] ) and ( [ pi0 ] ) , whose properties depend only on the system . clearly , once we know @xmath8 , by using eqs .",
    "( [ rho ] ) and ( [ pol ] ) , we can obtain a corresponding expression for the propagators @xmath14 and @xmath42 .",
    "we prefer to use their momentum representations , obtained from ( [ rpa ] ) and ( [ pi0 ] ) by taking fourier transforms with respect to the coordinates : [ qprop ] ( * q*,*q*,)=d*r * d*r* e^-i*q * ( * r*,*r*,)e^i*q*. the expression of the @xmath14 propagator is @xcite [ qpi0 ] & & ( * q*^,*q*,)= + & & ( 2)^3 _ * n*d*i*f(h_0(*i * ) ) + & & q^*_*n*(*q*,*i * )  q_*n*(*q , i * ) , with the fourier coefficients [ fou ] q_*n*(*q , i*)=de^-i*n *",
    "e^i*q*.    if the interaction @xmath43 does depend only on the distance between particles , the integral equation ( [ rpa ] ) becomes @xcite [ qrpa ] & & ( * q*^,*q*,)=^0(*q*^,*q * , ) + & & + d*k*^0(*q*^,*k * , ) v(k)(*k*,*q * , ) .",
    "spherical systems are an important class of integrable systems , hence they deserve a more detailed discussion .",
    "actually these systems are over - integrable , since in this case there are four constants of motion ( the particle enegy @xmath44 and the three components of its angular momentum @xmath45 , so one of the angle variables must also be constant .",
    "the action - angle variables @xmath24 allow for a very compact solution of the linearized vlasov equation ( [ lki1 ] ) , but they are not the only set of variables that can simplify the problem .",
    "the important point is to choose as variables the largest possible number of constants of motion , so that the number of partial derivatives in eq.([lki1 ] ) can be reduced .",
    "the variables used in @xcite instead of @xmath25 are @xmath46 of which four ( @xmath44 , @xmath47 , and the two angles @xmath48 and @xmath49 shown in fig.2 ) are constants of motion .",
    "so we are left only with the two partial derivatives with respect to @xmath50 and @xmath51 in eq.([lki1 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath51-derivative can be eliminated by means of the expansion [ pwe ] f(*r*,*p*,)=_lmf_lm(r,*p * , ) y_lm ( , ) and by using the well - known transformation property of the spherical harmonics @xmath52 under the rotation specified by the euler angles @xmath53 ( see e. g. @xcite , p. 28 ) : y_lm(,)=_n(d^l_mn ( , , ) ) ^ * y_ln(, ) .",
    "if the new reference frame rotates with the particle , the angles @xmath54 and @xmath55 are constant and the only time - dependent angle is @xmath51 .",
    "the quantities @xmath56 are the rotation matrices and their explicit @xmath51-dependence , of the kind @xmath57 , can be exploited to eliminate the @xmath51-derivative . in this way the initial three - dimensional problem is reduced to a one - dimensional problem for particles moving in the effective potential @xmath58 .    then , as shown in @xcite , the expansion ( [ pwe ] ) can be written as in @xmath59 . ] & & f(*r*,*p*,)= + & & _ lmn + & & ^l_mn(,,))^ * y_ln ( , ) .",
    "the functions @xmath59 refer to particles having positive @xmath60 or negative @xmath61 components of the radial velocity , of magnitude @xmath62 .",
    "the linearized vlasov equation ( [ lki1 ] ) implies the following system of coupled first - order differential equations in the variable @xmath50 for the functions @xmath59 [ sys ] f^l_mna_nf^l_mn = b^l_mn , with a_n(,,r,)= - and [ inho ] & & b^l_mn(,,r,)= + & & f ( ) ( + & & . the functions @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the coefficients of a multipole expansion similar to ( [ pwe ] ) for the external driving field and for the induced mean - field fluctuations , respectively .",
    "because of eq.([dev ] ) , the term @xmath64 couples the two equations ( [ sys ] ) for @xmath65 and @xmath66 : [ delvlm ] & & v_lm(r,)= + & & _",
    "n =- l^l |y_ln(,)|^2 + & & ddv_l(r , r ) + & & .    before solving the system of equations ( [ sys ] ) , we must specify the boundary conditions satisfied by the phase - space density fluctuations .",

    "the solution of the linearized vlasov equation for spherical systems agrees with that given by the method of action - angle variables @xcite .",
    "there are some some further simplifications for the polarization propagators of spherical systems , compared to those given in the previous subsection .",

    "these two frequencies determine the shape of the orbit in a central potential .",

    "( [ qpi0 ] ) and ( [ spi0 ] ) it has been asumed that the equilibrium distribution of particles depends only on the particle energy .",
    "usually one takes @xmath79,where @xmath80 is the fermi energy , so that @xmath81 and the expression ( [ spi0 ] ) becomes simpler .    at first sight",
    "it might seem that the infinite sum over @xmath82 in ( [ spi0 ] ) might create difficulties , but in practice it is enough to include in the sum the very first few terms around @xmath83 to get a sufficient approximation .",
    "the early calculations of kirzhnitz and collaborators suggested the existence of two collective high - energy excitations in the spectrum of heavy atoms @xcite .",
    "these excitations had been interpreted as collective , plasmon - type oscillations of the atomic electron cloud . in order to apply their formalism , kirzhnitz _",
    "et al . _ had to approximate the atomic self - consistent mean field with a potential in which electrons having zero total energy move along closed trajectories .",
    "our closely related approach allows also for orbits that are not closed , but , of course , it can be applied also to closed trajectories .",
    "this has been done in @xcite , where the calculations of kirzhnitz _ et al .",
    "_ have been repeated by using the formalism discussed in this section .",
    "in that study only one `` collective '' solution of the integral equation ( [ pil ] ) was found , moreover , thanks to the analytical insight given by the semiclassical method , this solution was shown to be qualitatively different from the plasma oscillations of a uniform electron gas . while plasma oscillations belong to a strong - coupling regime ( see e.g. @xcite , p. 185 ) , the `` collective '' solution found in @xcite pertains to a regime of weak coupling .",
    "thus it was concluded that there is no evidence for plasmon - like excitations in this semiclassical theory of atomic spectra .",
    "this conclusion is in agreement with the result of analogous quantum calculations .",
    "the equilibrium self - consistent mean field in heavy closed - shell nuclei is well approximated by a spherical saxon - woods potential , with parameters that can be determined phenomenologically .",
    "a somewhat similar mean field describes also metal clusters @xcite .",
    "thus ,    for open - shell systems it is reasonable to try a deformed saxon - woods like potential .",
    "however the results of the first subsection can not be applied to this kind of potentials , since accurate calculations of the classical phase space for axially deformed saxon - woods potentials have shown that it contains regions of chaoticity @xcite .",
    "but , if the surface diffuseness is neglected and a spheroidal cavity is assumed to approximate the mean field of large deformed nuclei @xcite or clusters , then that formalism can be applied directly .",
    "this has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite to study the surface plasmons in deformed atomic clusters .",
    "the main result of that paper is that , under certain conditions , oblate deformed clusters may display a more complex shape of the surface plasmon peaks than predicted by the classical mie theory ( three peaks instead of two ) .",
    "this prediction has not yet been checked experimentally .",
    "3 shows essentially the single - particle ( shaded black ) and collective ( shaded grey ) dipole strength functions for prolate and oblate spheroidal clusters .",
    "the figure is taken from ref .",
    "the deformation parameter @xmath84 is the ratio between the larger and smaller radius of the spheroid .",
    "the frequency is expressed in units of the mie frequency @xmath85 . in the lower panel",
    "the fragmentation of the high - frequency peak is clearly visible for deformations @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "in heavy closed - shell nuclei the equilibrium mean field can be further approximated by a spherical square - well potential of radius @xmath88 . in this simplified picture",
    "several of the quantities needed to evaluate the linear response of the system can be expressed analytically , hence it gives a useful reference model .",
    "when the surface diffusion is neglected , the boundary condition ( [ bc2 ] ) corresponds to requiring that the particles collide elastically with the static nuclear surface @xmath89 ( mirror - reflection condition ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that the results of @xcite can be generalized to a model in which the sharp surface is allowed to vibrate , simply by changing the boundary condition ( [ bc2 ] ) .",
    "if the radius of a spherical nucleus is allowed to vibrate according to the usual liquid - drop model expression @xcite [ lds ] r(,,t)=r+_lmr_lm(t ) y_lm ( , ) , then the mirror - reflection condition ( [ bc2 ] ) is changed to [ msc ] f^l+_mn(r)-f^l-_mn(r)=2f()ip_rr_lm ( ) , where @xmath90 is the magnitude of the radial component of the particle momentum .",
    "we put a tilde over the moving - surface solutions to distinguish them from the untilded fixed - surface solutions . the boundary condition ( [ msc ] )",
    "still corresponds to a mirror reflection , but in the reference frame of the moving surface .",

    "they are more complicated than the corresponding fixed - surface equations because they contain also the unknown collective coordinates @xmath91 . in order to proceed further ,",
    "we need an additional relation that specifies these quantities .",

    "the pole expansion of the cotangent z=^_n=- allows us to express @xmath106 in a form that is more similar to the @xmath109 propagator ( [ spi0 ] ) : & & _ l()=r^2 + & & _ n=-^ _ n =- l^l|y_ln(,)|^2 df ( ) + & & dp^2_r , but this only shows that @xmath106 is a rather involved complex function . the very fact that @xmath110 is complex is already an interesting result since we can expect complex eigenfrequencies as solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eigf ] ) , in close analogy with the landau damping phenomenon in homogeneous system and in contrast to the liquid - drop model condition ( [ ldmc ] ) that involves only real quantities .    in the case",
    "@xmath111 the function @xmath106 can be evaluated analytically @xcite , while for @xmath112 relatively simple expressions have been obtained for the coefficients of the low - frequency expansion _ l()a_l + i_l+d_l ^2 . for isoscalar monopole vibrations , the solution of eq.([eigf ] ) compares reasonably well with the experimental value of the monopole giant resonance energy in heavy nuclei .    for isoscalar quadrupole oscillations , in @xcite",
    "it was concluded that the approximation ( [ last0 ] ) is not adequate to describe the low - energy isoscalar quadrupole excitations .",
    "it is not clear if this failure is due to the neglect of the bulk mean - field fluctuations in ( [ last0 ] ) or to some other reason .",
    "further work is needed on this problem .",
    "about the low - energy isoscalar octupole oscillations , in @xcite it was concluded that they are overdamped in the approximation given by eq .",
    "( [ last0 ] ) , and this might offer a qualitative explanation for the background observed in inelastic proton scattering @xcite .",
    "another application of eq .",
    "( [ last0 ] ) has been made in ref .",
    "there this equation has been used to study the isoscalar dipole compression mode . in order to get reasonable results in this case",
    "it is vital to treat the centre of mass motion correctly , and this can be done in a fully self - consistent approach . because eq.([last0 ] ) is not really self - consistent , in @xcite it was found necessary to add an extra term to the dipole response function based on eq .",
    "( [ last0 ] ) . for other multipolarities this extra term",
    "can also be interpreted as the contribution to the response due to the change of shape of the system in the moving - surface approach , for @xmath113 the system does not change its shape , but can translate as a whole . since there is no force opposing this translation , this centre of mass motion results in a pole at @xmath114 in the dipole response function .",
    "the interesting physics is contained in the intrinsic response , that is shown in fig .",
    "the results of the moving - surface theory are in qualitative agreement with experimental data on the isoscalar dipole mode , as can be seen from fig .",
    "4 . moreover , the insight given by this semiclassical approach gives us the possibility to establish a direct link between the peak profile of the isoscalar dipole resonance and the incommpressibility of nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "this link is evidenced by the dashed curve in fig .",
    "the approach described here can be easily generalized to a two - component fluid .",
    "in @xcite such a generalization has been used to study the effect of neutron excess on the isoscalar and isovector monopole response functions .",
    "for such a two - component system , eq.([prr ] ) is replaced by the two following equations & & ( r,,,)= + & & _ rr^n ( r , , , ) ) + _ rr^p(r , , , ) and & & _ q(r,,,)= + & & _ rr^n ( r , , , ) ) -_rr^p(r , , , ) . here",
    "@xmath115 is the normal component of the momentum - flux tensor [ r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ prr ] ) ] associated with neutrons ( protons ) only . apart from the usual surface pressure @xmath116 that is present when the neutron and proton surfaces move in phase , in this case there is also an additional pressure @xmath117 that is caused by the forces opposing the pulling apart of the neutron and proton surfaces when they move out of phase .",
    "this extra pressure can also be related to an appropriate phenomenological parameter . with the surface energy of @xcite",
    ", the pressure @xmath117 can be written as [ delpiv ] & & _",
    "q(r,,,)= + & & q , where @xmath118 is the neutron skin stiffness coefficient of @xcite that is analogous to the surface tension parameter @xmath105 of eq .",
    "( [ rfp ] ) and @xmath119 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the neutron excess does not affect much the isoscalar giant monopole resonance , while its effect on the isovector resonance is more pronounced .",
    "the possibility of solving the vlasov equation with different boundary conditions allows us to decide which condition is more appropriate by comparison with experiment . in fig",
    "5 we give an example of a nuclear response function evaluated according to the fixed- and moving - surface boundary conditions .",
    "0.5 cm    in this case there is no doubt that comparison with data ( shown in fig .",
    "4 ) favours the moving - boundary solution , at least at the level of zero - order approximations .",
    "the present example is a rather extreme case , for other response functions the difference between the two solutions is not expected to be so large .",
    "work on detailed comparison between the two solutions for different multipolarities is still in progress .",
    "the vlasov theory is completely classical , however it is easy to establish a connection with quantum mechanics .",
    "it is well known that the time - dependent hartree - fock equation for the wigner transform of the quantal one - body density matrix reads ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite , p. 553 ) [ tdhf ] & & + f(*r*,*p*,t ) + & & [ + & & + v(*r*,*p*,t)]=0 and reduces to [ cl ] & & + + & & -()+ ( ) = 0 if @xmath120 .",
    "the hartree - fock potential @xmath121 is momentum - dependent because the fock term is non - local in coordinate space .",
    "if the momentum - dependence of @xmath122 is neglected ( hartree approximation ) , then eq .",
    "( [ cl ] ) coincides with eq .",
    "( [ kin ] ) .",
    "there are several possibilities for including quantum effects into the vlasov theory .",
    "the most trivial one is to choose an appropriate equilibrium distribution @xmath123 .",
    "the standard choice for zero - temperature fermions is [ f0 ] f(h_0(*r * , * p*))=(_f- h_0(*r * , * p * ) ) , where @xmath80 is the fermi enegy and @xmath124 is the degeneracy factor ( @xmath125 for electrons ( nucleons ) ) .",
    "the choice ( [ f0 ] ) respects the pauli principle in the sense that there can not be more than one fermion of given spin ( and isospin ) in a phase - space cell of volume @xmath126 .",
    "as stressed by bertsch @xcite , the liouville theorem then ensures that the pauli principle will be respected during the time evolution of the system described by the vlasov equation .",
    "thus the liouville theorem , stating that the points representing the system in the 6-dimensional phase space evolve as an incompressible fluid , justifies the use of the vlasov equation for quantum systems . using the equilibrium distribution ( [ f0 ] ) makes the completey classical vlasov approach a semiclassical one . clearly in this way",
    "we do not expect to reproduce details , but only gross properties of quantum many - body systems .    in principle one could introduce further quantum effects also by taking into account terms of order @xmath127 and higher that have been neglected in eq .",
    "( [ cl ] ) .",
    "the problem with such a direct approach is that the semiclassical calculations become quickly more complicated than the corresponding quantum calculations , so this method would not be very convenient .",
    "a more pragmatic attitude has been taken in refs . @xcite and @xcite , where the semiclassical propagators given by the vlasov theory have been compared directly with the analogous quantum propagators .",
    "in @xcite the relation between the fourier coefficients ( [ fou ] ) and the corresponding quantum matrix elements has been discussed .",
    "if single - particle matrix elements are evaluated in the wkb approximation , they tend to fourier coefficients analogous to ( [ fou ] ) in the limit of large quantum numbers , but this is not necessarily the case for the exact quantum matrix elements .    in @xcite",
    "the closed - orbit theory , that had been used by various authors to evaluate quantum corrections to the thomas - fermi level density , has been applied to evalute quantum corrections to the vlasov propagator ( [ qpi0 ] ) .",
    "the resulting strength function compares better with the analogous quantum strength function .",
    "a fascinating aspect of this study is the possibility of relating features of the excitation spectrum of quantum systems to simple properties of the classical orbits .",
    "in the kinetic - theory approach to linear response discussed here the finite size of the system has been explicitly taken into account .",
    "two different boundary conditions for the density oscillations have been considered : fixed and moving surface .",
    "the fixed - surface solution is closely related to the quantum random phase approximation ( rpa ) since the integral equation ( [ rpa ] ) for the semiclassical collective propagator is essentially the same as the equation for the quantum rpa propagator when exchange terms are neglected ( hartree approximation ) .",
    "the main difference between the semiclassical and quantum approaches is in the `` free '' propagator @xmath14 . while the quantum expression for this propagator involves wave functions and single - particle energies , the semiclassical propagator involves only properties of the classical orbits and is considerably simpler to evaluate .",
    "the moving - surface solution has been related to the liquid - drop model of nuclei .",
    "compared to that model , the present approach is more microscopic and it allows also for the possibility of landau damping of collective vibrations .    when compared to experiment , in some cases",
    "the semiclassical solutions have the same problems of the rpa and of the liquid - drop model .",
    "for example , the fixed - surface approach is , like rpa , able to describe reasonably well the position of the surface plasmon in atomic clusters , but , again like rpa , fails to reproduce the observed width of this resonance .",
    "possible moving - surface contributions to this width have not yet been investigated in detail within the present approach .",
    "the moving - surface approach shares with the liquid - drop model the difficulties in reproducing the experimental value of low - energy quadrupole oscillations in heavy nuclei .",
    "however the insight given by this approach could be useful for improving both the quantum rpa theory and the liquid - drop model . in conclusion ,",
    "the semiclassical theory discussed here offers an interesting alternative to the quantum rpa approach because it is simpler to implement numerically , but it is still sufficiently sophisticated to take into account some realistic features ( finite size , equilibrium shape ) of the many - body system .",
