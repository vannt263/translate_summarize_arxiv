    "the problem of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) bloch electron under a perpendicular magnetic field has attracted much interest for several decades , since not only it exhibits extremely rich energy band structures@xcite@xmath0@xcite but also it is closely related with various phenomena such as the quantum hall effect,@xcite the flux - state model for high-@xmath1 superconductivity,@xcite and the mean - field transition temperature of superconducting networks or josephson junction arrays.@xcite recently , by means of the remarkable advent of nanofabrication techniques , studies of finding the indication of the peculiar band structure and its effect on the transport and optical properties have been also extensively performed.@xcite@xmath0@xcite    a traditional method to solve this problem is to start with energy dispersion @xmath2 without a magnetic field and then make the peierls substitution @xmath3 to construct an effective single - band hamiltonian @xmath4 ,              \\label{eq:0}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the momentum operator and @xmath6 is a vector potential .",
    "an equivalent way to this method is to start directly with the tight - binding hamiltonian given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the hopping integral between the sites @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 is a state of an atomiclike orbital centered at the site @xmath9 , and @xmath12 is the magnetic phase factor defined by @xmath13 @xmath14 being the magnetic flux quantum .",
    "so far , a number of works have focused on the energy spectrum of a lattice with a square symmetry , and the magnetic subband structure of the lattice with isotropic hopping integrals between nearest - neighbor ( nn ) sites is well known as the hofstadter s butterfly.@xcite the effect of the anisotropy in the nn hopping integrals on the magnetic subband structure was also studied , and it was found that introducing the hopping anisotropy leads to the occurrence of band broadening and gap closing.@xcite@xmath0@xcite furthermore , the effect of next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) hopping integrals on the magnetic subband structure was also studied,@xcite and introducing the nnn hopping integrals was found to play a key role in removing the degeneracy which appears at the band center of the energy spectrum under isotropic nn hopping integrals .    along with the case of the square lattice ,",
    "magnetic subband structures of a triangular lattice have been intensively studied,@xcite@xmath0@xcite and it was found that the lattice with isotropic nn hopping integrals exhibits a recursive magnetic subband structure similarly to the case of the square lattice with isotropic nn hopping integrals.@xcite recently , the effect of the anisotropy in the nn hopping integrals on the magnetic subband structure was studied by gumbs and fekete.@xcite in studying the effect , they applied the peierls substitution for the energy dispersion given by @xmath15\\right.\\nonumber\\\\&&\\left.+t_{c}\\cos   \\left[(k_{x}-\\sqrt{3}k_{y } ) \\frac{a}{2}\\right]\\right\\ } \\label{eq:10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to construct a hamiltonian matrix . and",
    ", by diagonalizing the resultant matrix , they obtained magnetic subband structures for a few sets of ( @xmath16 ) and presented relevant arguments .",
    "however , unfortunately , most of the results and arguments presented by them are erroneous ones that arise from a mistake in deriving the hamiltonian , as we shall show below .",
    "we re - examine the same problem as that investigated by gumbs and fekete to put the correct formalism and numerical results , which is the first end of this paper .",
    "the second end of this paper is to examine the effect of isotropic nnn hopping integrals on the magnetic subband structure . to our knowledge , few work has been devoted to this problem .",
    "however , noting that the triangular lattice with nnn hopping integrals is topologically equivalent to the square lattice with nnn hopping integrals , it may be interesting to examine this problem and compare the results with the case of the square lattice .",
    "we will show that the magnetic subband structure changes considerably depending on the strength of the isotropic nnn hopping integrals .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we derive a generalized harper equation that includes nnn as well as nn hopping integrals . in sec .",
    "iii , we first point out the mistake and the misleading arguments presented in ref .  24 , and then present correct numerical results on the effects of both anisotropic nn and isotropic nnn hopping integrals on the magnetic subband structure .",
    "we also discuss the symmetries of the magnetic subband structure obtained from the generalized harper equation . finally , sec .",
    "iv is devoted to a brief summary .",
    "we consider an electron on a 2d triangular lattice with a hexagonal symmetry in the presence of a uniform perpendicular magnetic field @xmath17 . under the landau gauge ,",
    "the vector potential is given by @xmath18 and @xmath12 is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "here , @xmath21 labels the lattice points , i.e. , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the lattice constant . and , @xmath26 is the magnetic flux through the unit cell . by means of eqs .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:3 ] ) , the tight - binding equation , @xmath27 , can be written as @xmath28 \\nonumber \\\\     & & + t_{c}[e^{i\\pi\\phi(m+1/2)}\\psi_{m+1,n-1 }       + e^{-i\\pi\\phi(m-1/2)}\\psi_{m-1,n+1 } ]   \\nonumber \\\\     & & + t_{a}'[e^{i\\pi\\phi(m-3/2)}\\psi_{m-3,n-1 }       + e^{-i\\pi\\phi(m+3/2)}\\psi_{m+3,n+1 } ] \\nonumber \\\\     & & + t_{c}'[e^{i\\pi\\phi(m+3/2)}\\psi_{m+3,n-1 }       + e^{-i\\pi\\phi(m-3/2)}\\psi_{m-3,n+1 } ]   \\nonumber \\\\     & & + t_{b}'(e^{i2\\pi\\phi m}\\psi_{m , n-2 }       + e^{-i2\\pi\\phi m}\\psi_{m , n+2 } ) ,           \\label{eq:4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the nn hopping integral along the @xmath30 direction , @xmath31 is the nn hopping integral along the direction which makes @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) with the @xmath30 direction , and @xmath34 is the nnn hopping integral along the direction which makes @xmath35 ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) with the @xmath30 direction , respectively .",
    "since eq .",

    "before presenting our numerical results , we would like to point out the mistake made by gumbs and fekete in ref .",

    "the results of the operations are given by @xmath60 however , these are incorrect since the fundamental commutation relation @xmath61=i\\hbar$ ] is ignored in the operation .",
    "the correct results taking into account this relation should be expressed as@xcite @xmath62 we can easily check that the same equation as eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) with @xmath63 can be obtained by the method of the peierls substitution if eq .",
    "( [ eq:12 ] ) instead of eq .",
    "( [ eq:11 ] ) is applied .",
    "in fact , eq .  ( 6 ) of ref .  24 , which was derived by means of eq .",
    "( [ eq:11 ] ) , is a non - hermitian matrix , and thus it is unreasonable to obtain real energy eigenvalues from this matrix .",
    "figure  1 shows the @xmath64 diagram obtained by diagonalizing eq .",
    "( [ eq:9 ] ) for the parameters @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 with @xmath68 in the absence of the nnn hopping integral ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "it is obvious that the energy spectrum is _ not _ symmetric about @xmath70 and there is _ no _ distinct array of energy eigenvalues parallel to the energy axis in the two largest energy gaps , contrary to the argument of gumbs and fekete [ see    fig .  1 and the relevant arguments of ref .",
    "in fact , fig .  1 of this paper is exactly the same as fig .  3 of ref .  21 presented by claro and wannier if @xmath71 is replaced by @xmath72 , which is quite natural because both of the two papers deal with the same problem .",
    "the only difference between the two papers lies in choosing the @xmath30 and @xmath73 directions ; the axes taken in ref .",
    "21 are turned by @xmath35 from those in this paper .",
    "note that , even though the choice of the axes in ref .",
    "21 yields a three - term difference equation [ see eq .  ( 10 ) of ref .",
    "21 ] while the choice in this paper yields a five - term difference equation in the absence of nnn hopping integrals , the resultant energy band structures are the same , as shown above .",
    "figure  2 is the @xmath64 diagram for the parameters @xmath74 , @xmath66 , and ( a ) @xmath75 and ( b ) @xmath76 in the absence of nnn hopping integrals .",
    "the increase of total bandwidths and the occurrence of gap closing except for a few large ones are clearly seen .",
    "we argue that these behaviors may be generic effects of the hopping anisotropy , since the same phenomena were also observed in the square lattice.@xcite@xmath0@xcite note that fig .  3 of ref .",
    "24 is the @xmath64 diagram plotted for the same parameters used in plotting fig .",
    "2(a ) of this paper , from which gumbs and fekete argued that the bottom of the energy band is very flat near @xmath77 and that the spectrum is symmetric about @xmath70 .",
    "however , it is evident that their arguments are incorrect . in regard to figs",
    ".  2 @xmath78 4 of ref .",
    "24 , we would like to point out that the @xmath64 diagrams for the parameters @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 should be exactly the same when all the values of @xmath82 in the magnetic brillouin zone ( mbz ; @xmath83 and @xmath84 ) are taken into account , which means that there is no preferable direction in the lattice plane under a uniform perpendicular magnetic field .    in order to get more information on the anisotropy dependence of the subgap widths , we calculate the band structure as a function of the hopping anisotropy . note that the energy eigenvalues in the absence of a magnetic field satisfy the condition @xmath85 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) ] and the total bandwidth increases linearly with the increase of @xmath29 .",
    "assuming the situation also holds in the presence of a uniform magnetic field , we can introduce the rescaled energy defined by @xmath86 then , @xmath87 is always in the range of @xmath88 $ ] regardless of the strength of the hopping anisotropy , and we can examine more clearly the dependence of the subgap widths on the hopping anisotropy , in comparison with the isotropic case .",
    "figure  3(a ) shows the @xmath29 dependence of the band structure for @xmath89 , where @xmath74 and all the values of @xmath82 in the mbz are taken into account . at isotropic case ( @xmath90 ) ,",
    "there are five subbands and four subgaps .",
    "however , introducing the hopping anisotropy ( @xmath91 ) changes the band structure considerably .",
    "let us number the subgaps from the bottom of the energy spectrum .",
    "then , in the regime of @xmath92 , the first and the second subgaps close for a small amount of anisotropy , while the third and the fourth subgaps survive even for large values of anisotropy .",
    "however , since the widths of the third and the fourth subgaps decrease with increasing @xmath29 , we expect that these subgaps will also close in the limit of @xmath93 . and , in the regime of @xmath94 , the widths of the third and the fourth subgaps decrease with decreasing @xmath29 , as in the case of @xmath92 . meanwhile , the first and the second subgaps exhibit an interesting behavior .",
    "as @xmath29 decreases , the width of the first ( second ) subgap decreases such that it closes at @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) . and ,",
    "as @xmath29 decreases further , the subgap reopens and its width increases such that the width of the first ( second ) subgap becomes the same as that of the fourth ( third ) subgap , resulting in a symmetric band structure about @xmath97 in the limit of @xmath98 . since the triangular lattice with the parameters @xmath99 is topologically equivalent to the square lattice with isotropic nn hopping integrals , it is natural of the band structure to be symmetric about @xmath97 .    as an another example , we plot in fig .",
    "3(b ) the @xmath29 dependence of the band structure for @xmath100 . at isotropic case ( @xmath90 ) , there might be six subbands and five subgaps .",
    "however , due to the occurrence of band touching between the second and the third subbands , the second subgap is missing and the energy spectrum consists of four subgaps . and , in the regime of @xmath92 , we observe that the first subgap close even for a small amount of anisotropy and the third subgap close for a large value of anisotropy . besides ,",
    "since the widths of the fourth and the fifth subgaps decrease with increasing @xmath29 , the closing of these subgaps is expected in the limit of @xmath93 . meanwhile , the @xmath29 dependence of the missing second subgap exhibits an interesting feature ; the subgap opens with increasing @xmath29 , even though its width is very small . in the regime of @xmath94",
    ", we can see that the width of the first ( second ) subgap increases with decreasing @xmath29 such that the width becomes the same as that of the fifth ( fourth ) subgap , resulting in a symmetric band structure about @xmath97 in the limit of @xmath98 . and",
    ", the width of the third subgap decreases with decreasing @xmath29 and closes at @xmath101 .",
    "thus , there occurs a degeneracy at the band center of the energy spectrum , as in the case of the square lattice with isotropic nn hopping integrals .    2      in calculating energy eigenvalues with varying the nnn hopping integrals , we set @xmath65 and assume that the nnn hopping integrals are isotropic , i.e. , @xmath102 .",

    "we can see that the fractal structure in the energy spectrum appears despite of introducing the nnn hopping integral , which may attribute to the isotropy of the nn and the nnn hopping integrals .",
    "we can also see that , even though the total bandwidths for @xmath107 and @xmath108 increase monotonically with increasing @xmath109 , the bandwidths for generic values of @xmath110 depend crucially on @xmath109 , resulting in diverse shapes of @xmath64 diagrams . for small values of @xmath109 ,",
    "the bandwidths become narrower than the case of @xmath111 and the resultant diagram exhibits a vary narrow structure [ see fig .",
    "however , the bandwidths increase with increasing @xmath109 , resulting in a fat structure of @xmath64 diagram [ see figs .",

    "it may be interesting to compare this behavior with the case of the square lattice , since the triangular lattice with @xmath116 is topologically equivalent to the square lattice with isotropic ( anisotropic ) nnn hopping integrals if @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) . in the square lattice , introducing the nnn hopping integrals",
    "removes the degeneracy appearing at @xmath97 for even values of @xmath46.@xcite however , in the triangular lattice , a degeneracy occurs at @xmath97 in the energy spectrum for @xmath70 when @xmath119 .",
    "the @xmath109 dependence of the band structures for @xmath120 and @xmath121 also exhibit interesting features . in these cases ,",
    "there are three subgaps at @xmath111 . and , with increasing @xmath109 , the widths of these subbands decrease up to a certain value of @xmath109 [ see fig .  4(a ) ] , and then increase such that the two subgaps close [ see figs .",

    "in summary , the effects of anisotropic nn hopping integrals and of isotropic nnn hopping integrals on the magnetic subband structure of an electron on a triangular lattice were studied within the tight - binding approximation .",
    "it was found that the phenomena of bandwidth broadening , gap closing , and gap opening are generic feature of introducing the nn hopping anisotropy .",
