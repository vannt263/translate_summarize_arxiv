    "we draw the readers attention to the fact that the pressure of @xmath0 gpa represents the highest value of @xmath12 considered by yabuuchi _",
    "additionally , the high value of the critical temperature at @xmath23 gpa , which is equal to @xmath24 k , has been recently confirmed by the results obtained by sakata _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "for the purpose of this paper , we have assumed that the phase ca - vi is being characterized by the @xmath25 crystal structure . to support this assumption",

    "on the imaginary axis ( @xmath26 ) , the order parameter ( @xmath27 ) and the wave function renormalization factor ( @xmath28 ) can be calculated by using the eliashberg equations @xcite : @xmath29 @xmath30 in equations ( [ r1 ] ) and ( [ r2 ] ) the symbol @xmath31 denotes the @xmath32-th matsubara frequency , where @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is the boltzmann constant .    the complicated form of the electron - phonon pairing kernel is represented by the expression : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the maximum phonon frequency ( @xmath37 mev ) , and @xmath38 indicates the eliashberg function , which models the shape of the electron - phonon interaction in a detailed way . in the presented paper , the form of the @xmath38 function has been taken from yin _ et al",
    ". _ @xcite .",
    "the depairing interaction between electrons is described with the use of the coulomb pseudopotential ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the symbol @xmath40 denotes the heaviside function and @xmath41 is the phonon cut - off frequency : @xmath42 .    in the presented paper",
    "the eliashberg equations have been solved for @xmath43 matsubara frequencies ( @xmath44 ) . in this case , the obtained solutions are stable for the temperatures greater than or equal to @xmath45 k. a detailed discussion of the numerical method has been presented in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the physical value of the coulomb pseudopotential ( @xmath46 ) can be defined by using the condition : @xmath47_{t = t_{c}}=0 $ ] , where the critical temperature is equal to the experimental value ( @xmath2 k ) @xcite .     for selected values of the coulomb pseudopotential ( @xmath48 ) .",

    "one can notice that together with the increase of the coulomb pseudopotential , the largest value of the order parameter ( @xmath50 ) decreases .",
    "additionally , in figure ( b ) we have outlined the complete form of the function @xmath51 . on the basis of the obtained results",
    ", we have found that the physical value of the coulomb pseudopotential is equal to @xmath52 .",
    "the above result means that the depairing electron correlations in calcium are relatively strong ( the classical low - temperature superconductors @xmath46 is about @xmath53 @xcite ) .",
    "it can be noted that similar non - standard value of @xmath46 has been obtained for lithium and @xmath54 @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "for example , the properties of the superconducting state in the fcc phase of lithium for the pressure values @xmath55 gpa ( @xmath56 k ) and @xmath57 gpa ( @xmath58 k ) have been specified in the paper @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the physical value of the coulomb pseudopotential increases with @xmath12 from @xmath59 to @xmath60 . in the case of @xmath54 ,",
    "the parameter @xmath46 is equal to @xmath61 ( @xmath62 gpa and @xmath63 k ) @xcite .",
    "the high values of @xmath46 in ca , li , and @xmath54 are difficult to explain in the framework of the classical morel - anderson ( ma ) model @xcite , where : @xmath64^{-1}$ ] .",

    "since @xmath71 , the ma pseudopotential is of the order @xmath53 and @xmath72 .    it can be noted that the ma model corresponds to treating the irreducible vertex to the first order in @xmath68 .",
    "recently , bauer , han , and gunnarsson have extended the ma theory to the second order in @xmath68 .",
    "the main result is that the retardation effects lead to the reduction @xmath73 also in the higher order calculation , but not as efficiently as in the first order @xcite .",
    "the model presented in the paper @xcite is probably the most advanced attempt to explain the high values of @xmath46 in ca , li , and @xmath54 .",
    "in particular , bauer _",
    "et al . _ have given the following expression for the physical value of the coulomb pseudopotential : @xmath74+a\\mu^{2}\\ln\\left[\\frac{\\alpha\\omega_{e}}{\\omega_{ph}}\\right]},\\ ] ] where @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "on the basis of the equation ( [ rdodatkowe ] ) one can easily estimate the value of @xmath68 for the real materials . in the paper , we assume the following : @xmath77 ( @xmath78 is the half - band width ) , @xmath79 ( @xmath80 $ ] ) , and @xmath81 ( the constant dos ) . in the literature ,",

    "the result is the following : @xmath86 mev .",
    "next , we address an important issue , namely , how big is the error bar of the calculated physical value of the coulomb pseudopotential ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "first of all , we can notice that in the framework of the presented analysis , the value of @xmath46 depends on the shape of the eliashberg function and the accuracy of the experimental value of @xmath11",
    ". for calcium the appropriate eliashberg function , taken from @xcite , has been calculated by using the linear - response method ( full - potential lmtart code @xcite ) . in that paper ,",
    "the eliashberg function error bar has been omitted ( @xmath88_{\\alpha^{2}f\\left(\\omega\\right)}=0 $ ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , the value of the critical temperature has been measured with the accuracy about @xmath89 k @xcite .",
    "on the basis of these facts , we have obtained : @xmath88_{t_{c}}=\\pm 0.02 $ ] .",
    "the solid line denotes the results obtained with the help of the modified allen - dynes formula .",
    "finally , the dashed and dotted lines have been generated based on the classical allen - dynes formula and the mcmillan expression , respectively . ]    in the framework of the presented formalism , the exact value of the critical temperature should be obtained on the basis of eliashberg equations . however , in the case of the data interpretation , it is far more convenient to use the simple formula that explicitly reproduces the results of the advanced numerical calculations . in the branch literature there are known two basic formulas that serve for the determination of the critical temperature s value .",
    "the first one has been introduced by mcmillan @xcite ; the second one is the allen - dynes expression @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , in the case of calcium , both formulas considerably underestimate the critical temperature . according to the above",
    ", the allen - dynes formula has been modified in such a way , that it allows us to reproduce the numerical results correctly .",
    "particularly , in order to achieve the proper values of the fitting parameters , the dependence of the critical temperature on the coulomb pseudopotential has been analyzed on the level of the eliashberg equations ( only @xmath38 has been considered as the physical input parameter ) .",
    "next , the least - squares method was applied .",
    "the obtained result is presented below :    @xmath90,\\ ] ]    where the functions @xmath91 and @xmath92 are expressed by the formulas : @xmath93^{\\frac{1}{3}},\\ ] ] and @xmath94 the parameters , that depend on the eliashberg function , can be determined on the basis of the expressions : @xmath95 and @xmath96 . for calcium under the pressure at @xmath0 gpa , we have respectively : @xmath97 @xmath98 and @xmath99 . the fitting functions @xmath100 and @xmath101 are presented in the following forms : @xmath102 and @xmath103 in figure we have presented the numerical solutions obtained with the use of the eliashberg equations and the modified allen - dynes formula . additionally , for the comparison purposes",
    ", we have depicted the results based on the classical formulas derived by allen - dynes and mcmillan . on the basis of figure",
    ", one can observe , that the expression ( 4 ) perfectly reproduces the exact eliashberg numerical predictions .",
    "the constants in the equation ( 4 ) deviate notably from the original parameterization .",
    "this situation is connected with the fact that the analysis based on the real - axis eliashberg equations suggests only the semiphenomenological form of the @xmath11-formula : @xmath104 $ ] ( see the detailed discussion in @xcite , p. 1051",
    "- 1052 ) . in the case of calcium under the pressure at @xmath0 gpa ,",
    "the values of the allen - dynes parameters are inappropriate .",
    "thus , the constants ( @xmath105 ) should be fit to the data taken from the exact solutions of the eliashberg equations .",
    "we can notice that the change of the coefficient in the expression ( 4 ) under @xmath106 from @xmath107 to @xmath108 slightly lowers the phonon frequency ; the two remaining parameters ( 1.03 and 0.06 ) , in comparison to the classical parameterization , increase the value of the effective electron - phonon coupling constant .",
    "moreover , the parameterization of the strong - coupling correction function ( @xmath91 ) and the shape correction function ( @xmath92 ) also deviates from the original form .",
    "the achieved result indicates that for the high - pressure superconducting state in calcium the shape function has greater significance than in the classical superconductors .",
    "the value of the critical temperature for @xmath109 gpa has been also calculated in the paper @xcite . by using the allen - dynes formula",
    "the authors have qualitatively reconstructed the experimental value of @xmath11 . however , in the examined case the physical value of the coulomb pseudopotential has been strongly lowered ( @xmath110 ) .    in the last step ,",
    "we boldly underline that in the literature exist other calculations of @xmath111 than has been presented in the paper @xcite .",
    "in particular , lei _",
    "et al . _ have suggested a very large value of the electron - phonon coupling constant ( @xmath112 for @xmath113 gpa and the sc structure ) @xcite . on the other hand , aftabuzzaman and islam",
    "have predicted @xmath114 for @xmath23 gpa and the _ pnma _ structure @xcite .",
    "the last result is similar to the result obtained by yin _",
    "the form of the order parameter on the imaginary axis for selected values of the temperature has been presented in figure ( a ) .",
    "it has been shown that together with the increase of @xmath49 the absolute values of @xmath115 are decreasing and are subjected to saturation .",
    "it should be underlined that taking the negative values by the order parameter function is connected with the non - zero value of the coulomb pseudopotential .",
    "when analyzing the temperature s dependence of the order parameter , we found that absolute values of the function @xmath115 decrease together with the temperature s growth .",
    "the above result means that together with the growth of the temperature , the less number of matsubara frequencies give significant contribution to the eliashberg equations .",
    "the full dependence of the maximum value of the order parameter ( @xmath50 ) on the temperature has been plotted in figure ( b ) .",
    "we can observe that the values @xmath116 with a good approximation reproduce the temperature dependence of the energy gap at the fermi level .     for selected values of the temperature .",
    "( b ) the maximum value of the order parameter as a function of the temperature . ]    in figure ( a ) we have presented the form of the wave function renormalization factor on the imaginary axis .",
    "similarly as for the order parameter , the increase of @xmath49 causes the decrease of the successive values of the function @xmath117 . in the case of the high values of @xmath49 ,",
    "the function @xmath117 is subjected to the saturation and takes the value equal to one .",
    "further , figure ( b ) presents the full dependence of the maximum value of the wave function renormalization factor on the temperature .",
    "it can be noted that the presented function with a good approximation determines the temperature dependence of the electron effective mass .",
    "moreover , from the obtained results , we can conclude that the electron effective mass takes a high value in the entire area of the existence of the superconducting state .     for selected values of the temperature .",
    "( b ) the maximum value of the wave function renormalization factor as a function of the temperature . ]",
    "in order to determine the physical value of the order parameter for the chosen temperature , the solutions of the eliashberg equations on the imaginary axis ( @xmath118 ) should be analytically continued on the real axis ( @xmath119 ) . in the presented paper",
    "we have used the method introduced by beach _",
    "the form of the order parameter on the real axis is being reproduced by using the function : @xmath120 where @xmath121 and @xmath122 denote the number coefficients , and @xmath123 .",
    "the dependence of the real and imaginary part of the order parameter on the frequency for selected values of the temperature has been presented in figure .",
    "additionally , the rescaled eliashberg function has been specified .",
    "on the basis of the presented results , one can observe that in the range of the low frequencies ( from @xmath13 to about @xmath124 mev ) , only the real part of the order parameter takes the non - zero values . from the physical point of view",
    ", the obtained result defines the lack of the damping effects . for the higher values of the frequency ( from about @xmath124 mev to about @xmath125 mev ) , the real part of the order parameter takes relatively high values , which are clearly induced by the characteristic peaks in the eliashberg function .",
    "furthermore , we can notice that in the discussed range of the energy , the imaginary part of the order parameter becomes non - zero and strongly increases together with the increase of frequency .",
    "for the higher frequencies ( above @xmath125 mev ) , the real part of the order parameter begins to vanish .",
    "this fact is related to the extinction of the eliashberg function itself .",
    "the physical value of the order parameter for the chosen temperature should be determined on the basis of the expression @xcite , @xcite :    @xmath126.\\ ] ]    in the case of the superconductors the most interesting is the value of the order parameter for the temperature of zero kelvin ( @xmath127 ) .",
