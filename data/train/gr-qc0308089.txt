    "in this paper we want to report on parallel observations in two , at first glance , quite unrelated fields of current research . the one is a discrete network approach to quantum space - time physics , the other is the analysis of large complicated information networks of interacting agents , displaying the small world phenomenon and/or the synchronisation or phase locking among , for example , coupled non - linear oscillators as they occur in biological and related model systems . as the literature concerning the latter phenomenon is huge and as we are planning to discuss the relevance of this particular phenomenon of synchronisation for our own approach to quantum gravity elsewhere , we mention only very few but typical papers ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and the book @xcite",
    ".    in the following we will rather concentrate on the parallels between , on the one hand , the small world phenomenon and/or the emergence of scale free networks ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and , on the other hand , our dynamical network approach to quantum space - time physics ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the small world phenomenon was , for the first time , observed in empirical networks while in the past , most of the network modelling exploited the random graph concept . in this",
    "latter framework links are drawn ( practically ) independently of each other according to a certain edge probability . as a consequence , in general no particular near- or far - order",
    "does exist .",
    "therefore it came as quite a surprise that in the real world networks do occur , which seem to encode a certain ( hidden ) principle which combines a sparse wiring ( usually implying a large typical node distance and a low local clustering ) with both a surprisingly high local clustering and a relatively small average node distance .    on the other hand , ( sparse ) random graphs , more precisely , random graphs with a comparable edge probability , have typically both a low local clustering and , at least in general , a small diameter or average node distance ( see section [ random ] ) .",
    "this observation suggests that a particular principle is at work , amalgamating these two seemingly antagonistic properties .",
    "analysing the underlying laws which may lead to such an interesting structure , barabasi et al contributed the concept of scale free networks , having , for example , a power law vertex degree distribution ( in contrast to random graphs in which the vertex degree is binomially or poisson distributed ) .",
    "this notion calls to mind concepts like critical behavior or self - similarity .",
    "while the small world effect is attributed to the existence of short cuts or hubs , scale freeness is a much stronger property and points to the existence of a certain hierarchical organisation of the network .",
    "this latter observation establishes the link to our own research in the field of quantum space - time physics . in the recent past ,",
    "being unaware of the possible connections to the small world phenomenon , we were led to the conclusion that the geometric renormalisation group or coarse graining process we developed within our discrete network approach , leads only to an interesting large scale fixed point , we finally want to associate with our macroscopic or mesoscopic space - time ( compared to the primordial planck scale regime ) , if the initial network of relations is in a very particular critical state .",
    "geometrically this implies that the wiring of the primordial network is in a certain sense organised in a hierarchical , scale free manner , which strongly resembles the features described above .",
    "it is perhaps particular noteworthy that in our case this scale freeness is accomplished by a certain translocal character of the wiring which emerges in the renormalisation process ( existence of a hierarchy of short cuts ) .",
    "this provides also strong clues as to certain mysteries of the quantum world .",
    "we conclude this introduction with some interdisciplinary speculation . for biological and many other networks",
    "the central objective is that they function .",
    "that is , their organisation should make them robust and resistent to ( at least ) local and/or stochastic failures . if one observes the particular kind of ( intricate ) organisation in quite a few real networks we mentioned above , one is led to surmise that properties like scale freeness or small world behavior will in fact make them more robust ( cf .",
    "also @xcite ) .",
    "if the parallels we invoked regarding a possible similar organisation of microscopic space - time do not turn out to be unfounded , the same conclusion can be drawn here . that is , given that microscopic space - time is a highly complicated dynamical network , wildly fluctuating on small scales , the organisation principles we are going to describe in the following may be crucial in preventing such a structure from becoming chaotic or simply disintegrating into incoherent pieces .",
    "an important role in this context is expected to be played by the alluded translocal bridges on microscopic scales between macroscopically widely separated lumps of space - time .",
    "in this section we introduce some terminology and concepts employed in graph theory and fix the notation . as to the general context",
    "see for example @xcite    [ graph1]a simple , countable , labelled , undirected graph , @xmath0 , consists of a countable set of nodes or vertices , @xmath1 , and a set of edges , @xmath2 , each connecting two of the nodes . there exist no multiple edges ( i.e. edges , connecting the same pair of nodes ) or elementary loops ( an edge , starting and ending at the same node ) .",
    "in this situation the edges can be described by giving the corresponding set of unordered pairs of nodes .",
    "the members of @xmath1 are denoted by @xmath3 , the edges by @xmath4 , connecting the nodes @xmath3 and @xmath5 .",
    "remarks : we could also admit a non - countable vertex set .",
    "the above restriction is only made for technical convenience . from a physical point of view",
    "one may argue that the continuum or uncountable sets are idealisations , anyhow .",
    "the notions vertex , node or edge , link or bond are used synonymously .",
    "furthermore , the labeling of the nodes is only made for technical convenience ( to make some discussions easier ) and does not carry a physical meaning . as in general relativity ,",
    "all models being invariant under graph isomorphisms ( i.e. relabelling of the nodes and corresponding bonds ) are considered to be physically equivalent .    in the above definition",
    "the edges are not directed ( but oriented ; see below ) . in certain cases",
    "it is also useful to deal with directed graphs .",
    "a directed graph is a graph as above , with @xmath2 consisting now of directed bonds or ordered pairs of nodes . in this case",
    "we denote the edge , pointing from @xmath3 to @xmath5 by @xmath6 .",
    "there may now also exist the opposite edge , denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "an undirected graph , as in definition [ graph1 ] , can be considered as a particular directed graph with @xmath4 corresponding to the pair of directed edges , @xmath8 .    in",
    "the following we deal , for reasons of simplicity , with connected graphs .",
    "we denote the number of vertices and edges by @xmath9 , @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the maximal possible number of edges over @xmath9 vertices is @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath9 , @xmath10 , are called order and size of the graph , @xmath0 .",
    "the number of edges , being incident with a node , @xmath3 , is called its vertex degree , @xmath12 . an edge sequence or walk",
    "is a sequence of consecutive edges or nodes , @xmath13 where the edges or nodes need not be distinct .",
    "a path is an edge sequence where no @xmath14 occurs twice with the possible exception of @xmath15 . in the latter case the path",
    "is called a cycle .    between each pair of nodes , @xmath16 , there exists a path , @xmath17 , of minimal length , @xmath18 , with @xmath19 , connecting @xmath3 and @xmath20 .",
    "this path is called a geodesic path and defines a distance function or metric , @xmath21 on the graph .",
    "we have @xmath22 @xmath23 this metric is called the canonical graph metric .",
    "there exist of course other interesting distance concepts on graphs , cf .",
    "for example @xcite , where we compared , among other things , the canonical with the connes - metric on graphs .",
    "the above metric allows us to introduce a neighborhood concept .",
    "we denote by @xmath24 the set of nodes having exactly distance @xmath18 from the reference node @xmath25 and by @xmath26 the set of nodes with distance @xmath27 .",
    "the cardinality of @xmath28 is just the vertex degree of @xmath25 . in @xcite",
    "we studied systematically the scaling behavior of @xmath29 and @xmath30 with @xmath18 ( that is , the number of nodes in @xmath31 ) and related it to dimensional concepts of , typically , fractal type .",
    "we argued that it encodes the kind of dimension which turns out to be relevant in many physical systems .    in @xcite",
    "the sequence of @xmath32 is called the distance degree sequence relative to node @xmath25 , and is denoted by @xmath33 .",
    "tabulating this for the whole graph , @xmath0 , we get the distance distribution @xmath34 with @xmath35 the number of pairs , @xmath36 , having distance equal to @xmath18 .",
    "we have of course @xmath37 whereas @xmath38 derives from the ensemble of @xmath39 , it is frequently easier to handle and gives a more compact characteristic of the global wiring structure of the graph under discussion .    from the above a particularly important graph characteristic",
    "can be derived which is heavily employed in the small world context .",
    "the mean distance , l(g ) , of a connected graph is given by the average of the distances between the pairs of nodes of g. @xmath40    if graphs become very large it is frequently very difficult to envisage the essentials of the geometric structure of a given graph .",
    "so it is useful to develop more concepts which allow us to encode typical characteristics of the graph under discussion .",
    "a more subtle concept is the clique structure or clique distribution .    with @xmath0 a given fixed graph and @xmath41 a subset of its vertex set @xmath1 , the corresponding _ induced subgraph _ over @xmath41 ( that is , its edges being the corresponding edges , occurring in @xmath0 )",
    "is called a subsimplex or a complete subgraph , if all its pairs of nodes are connected by a bond . in this class , which is in fact partially ordered ,",
    "the order being given by graph inclusion , there exist certain _ maximal subsimplices _ ,",
    "that is , subsimplices so that every addition of another node of the underlying graph(together with the respective bonds existing in @xmath0 and pointing to other nodes of the selected subset destroys this property .",
    "these maximal simplices are usually called _ cliques _ in combinatorics ( we like to call them also lumps as they are the candidates for our construction of _ physical points _ ) .",
    "it has been described in detail in e.g. section 4 of @xcite how these cliques can be constructed in an algorithmic way , starting from an arbitrary node .",
    "note in particular that a given node will , in general belong to many different ( overlapping ) cliques or lumps .",
    "the situation is illustrated by the following picture :    in this picture we have drawn a subgraph of a larger graph .",
    "@xmath42 denotes a clique , i.e. a maximal subsimplex .",
    "subsets of nodes of such a clique support subsimplices ( called faces in algebraic topology ) , the clique being the maximal element in this partial ordered set . @xmath43 and @xmath44 are other , smaller cliques overlapping with @xmath42 in a common bond or node .",
    "@xmath45 is an example of a subgraph which is not a clique or subsimplex .",
    "evidently , each node or bond lies in at least one clique . the smallest possible cliques which can occur in a connected graph consist of two nodes and the corresponding edge .",
    "the detailed investigation of the clique structure of graphs was one of the main topics of @xcite and earlier in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "+ remark : note that our definition of a clique ( which conforms with bollobas ) deviates slightly from the one employed by other authors .",
    "our cliques are the maximal !",
    "members in the ascending chains of complete subgraphs while sometimes the complete subgraphs themselves are called cliques .",
    "the typical order of cliques turns out to be a very interesting random variable in random graphs ( see below ) .",
    "another interesting notion is the cluster coefficient , @xmath46 .",
    "it is defined by @xmath47 here @xmath48 is the maximal possible number of edges in @xmath49 and @xmath50 the actual number .",
    "henceforth , @xmath51 denotes the average over the @xmath52 s .",
    "further useful concepts are the average vertex degree and the vertex degree distribution @xmath53 @xmath54 where either the probability is taken over a certain ensemble of graphs or is calculated in a given fixed graph ( cf . the end of the next section ) .    in this way one can construct a whole bunch of interesting graph characteristics which are more or less related to each other and their combination supplying a relatively complete picture of the local and global structure of a graph .",
    "these concepts become particularly powerful if we combine them with true probabilistic or statistical concepts .",
    "this leads to the definition of a random graph .",
    "one kind of probability space is constructed as follows .",
    "take all possible labeled graphs over @xmath9 nodes as probability space @xmath55 ( i.e. each graph represents an elementary event ) .",
    "the maximal possible number of bonds is @xmath56 , which corresponds to the unique _ simplex graph _",
    "( denoted usually by @xmath57 ) .",
    "give each bond the _ independent probability _",
    "@xmath58 , ( more precisely , @xmath59 is the probability that there is a bond between the two nodes under discussion ) .",
    "let @xmath60 be a graph over the above vertex set , @xmath1 , having @xmath10 bonds .",
    "its probability is then @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "there exist @xmath63 different labeled graphs @xmath60 , having @xmath10 bonds , and the above probability is correctly normalized , i.e. @xmath64 this probability space is sometimes called the space of _ binomially random graphs _ and denoted by @xmath65 .",
    "note that the number of edges is binomially distributed , i.e. @xmath66 and @xmath67    the really fundamental observation made already by erds and rnyi ( a rigorous proof of this deep result can e.g. be found in @xcite ) is that there are what physicists would call phase transitions in these random graphs . to go a little bit more into the details we have to introduce some more graph concepts .",
    "_ graph properties _ are certain particular _ random variables _ ( indicator functions of so - called events ) on the above probability space @xmath68 .",
    "i.e. , a graph property , @xmath69 , is represented by the subset of graphs of the sample space having the property under discussion .    to give some examples : i ) connectedness of the graph , ii ) existence and number of certain particular subgraphs ( such as subsimplices etc . ) , iii ) other geometric or topological graph properties etc .    in this context erds and rnyi",
    "made the following important observation .    a large class of _ graph properties _",
    "( e.g. the _ monotone increasing ones _",
    "@xcite or @xcite ) have a so - called _ threshold function _",
    ", @xmath70 , with @xmath71 , so that for @xmath72 the graphs under discussion have _ property _ @xmath69 _ almost shurely _ for @xmath73 and _ almost shurely not _ for @xmath74 or vice versa ( more precisely : for @xmath75 ; for the details see the above cited literature ) .",
    "that is , by turning on the probability @xmath59 , one can drive the graph one is interested in beyond the phase transition threshold belonging to the graph property under study .",
    "note that , by definition , threshold functions are only unique up to `` factorization '' , i.e. @xmath76 is also a threshold function .",
    "we briefly illustrate the effects of randomisation on some of the concepts introduced above .",
    "we take for example the vertex degree as a random variable .",
    "the probability of a vertex , @xmath3 , having vertex degree @xmath77 is @xmath78 ( the mean value being @xmath79 ) . in the asymptotic regime of large @xmath9 ,",
    "small @xmath77 , @xmath80 , the vertex degree is poisson - distributed ( see , for example , @xcite ) . for",
    "a clean discussion of the assymptotic case of the poisson distribution see @xcite .",
    "barabasi et al contrasted this kind of distribution with so - called scale free degree distributions which are sometimes found in empirical networks ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "for the clustering coefficient , defined above , we have in the context of random graphs the following simple result . as all the edges",
    "are independently distributed with probabiliy @xmath59 over the random graph , the distribution is the same for each subclass of nodes , that is , we have @xmath81 in contrast to that typical small world networks may be globally sparse , i.e. @xmath82 , but , nevertheless , @xmath83 .",
    "that is , in contrast to randomly wired networks they may display a certain local order which differs from the order viewed on a more global level .    very interesting is the behavior of the average length , @xmath84 , in a random graph .",
    "this random variable , together with the clustering coefficient , is the pair of graph properties which is primarily employed to contrast the behavior of random graphs with the wiring diagrams of so - called small world networks ( see @xcite and the other literature cited above ) .",
    "it is a remarkable ( perhaps a little bit counter - intuitive ) property of random graphs that for a large portion of values in the parameter space , given by the pair @xmath85 , that is , @xmath59 not too small , a typical random graph has diameter less than or equal to two !",
    "( for the details see e.g. @xcite , some estimates are also given in @xcite , p.2053f ) .",
    "to have at all some ( weak ) scaling with @xmath9 , @xmath86 has to vanish for @xmath72 sufficiently strongly without destroying the connectedness of the graph .    to underpin this qualitative statement , we take over the central result of chapt .",
    "x.2 of @xcite and calculate its asymptotic behavior for the regime ; @xmath9 large and @xmath87 .",
    "we have for the diameter the approximative result @xmath88 where @xmath89 in a random graph , hence @xmath90 a similar result holds for the average distance , which is , however , not so easily accessible in general .",
    "strogatz and watts ( @xcite,@xcite ) contrast this weak scaling with the scaling of , for example , lattice graphs , which are occupying exactly the opposite end with respect to order or randomness .    the average distance in a @xmath91-dimensional lattice graph ( with , for simplicity , periodic boundary conditions )",
    "can easily be calculated as follows ( cf .",
    "also @xcite for more general scenarios ) .",
    "the @xmath92 of the @xmath33 of some arbitrary node scale as @xmath93 . for the average distance relative to @xmath25 we hence have @xmath94 with @xmath95 .",
    "this behaves in leading order as @xmath96 .",
    "that is , @xmath84 scales linearly with the diameter @xmath97 .",
    "it is perhaps interesting to compare the two notions , clustering coefficient and clique order , introduced above , in a small network and a random graph .",
    "as cliques are subgraphs of the graphs generated by vertices , @xmath98 , and their one - neigborhoods , @xmath99 , it is reasonable to calculate the edge probability only with respect to the induced subgraphs formed by @xmath99 and @xmath98 . from the clustering coefficient , @xmath51 , and the average vertex degree , @xmath1 , we get a corresponding local edge probability : @xmath100 for @xmath101 sufficiently large .",
    "with this @xmath102 we can now calculate the typical clique order , @xmath103 , if we treat the above subgraphs as random graphs .",
    "we get @xmath104 ( cf .",
    "section 5.1 ) .",
    "that is , the clique order scales with @xmath51 roughly as @xmath105 .",
    "we conclude that , as in a small world network @xmath51 is larger than @xmath106 , where @xmath106 is the clustering coefficient in a random graph with the same global edge probability , we have correspondingly @xmath107 and hence @xmath108",
    ". therefore both the clustering coefficient and the clique order are larger in a small world network than in a true random graph with the same global edge probability .",
    "we close this section with a brief remark about the statistical framework , as certain points in this connection are sometimes glossed over in the literature .",
    "we actually are dealing with two kinds of statistics in this enterprise .",
    "for one , if we have very large networks or graphs , we can apply ( practical ) statistics within the concretely given individual system , that is , perform certain averages over nodes , edges and the like . on the other hand",
    ", we may prefer to study a full ensemble of such graphs , formed according to certain statistical or probabilistical principles , an example being the above probability space of ( binomially distributed ) random graphs .    in principle",
    "these are different statistical frameworks , but in practice they are frequently intermixed .",
    "we note in passing that a similar philosophy underlies the foundations of statistical mechanics .",
    "if a system is both sufficiently large and sufficiently typical or generic , the differences are expected to be negligible .",
    "but in any case , it may be wise to remember these ( frequently only implicit ) statistical preassumptions .",
    "we made some more detailed ( physical ) remarks about the statistical hypothesis in sect .",
    "3.1 of @xcite .",
    "we briefly want to motivate why we are modelling the underlying fabrique of space - time or the quantum vacuum as a relational network of nodes and links , the geometrical aspects of which can be dealt with in the context of graphs .    on the one side we have a working philosophy which is similar to the one , expounded by t hooft in e.g. @xcite to @xcite .",
    "that is , we entertain the idea that for example quantum theory may well emerge as an effective ( continuum ) theory on the mesoscopic scale of an underlying discrete more microscopic theory .",
    "as we want our underlying ( pre)geometry to coevolve with the patterns living in this substratum , we developed the above mentioned generalisation of the more regular cellular automata .",
    "another essential property of such discrete dynamical systems is , while the basic ingredients and elementary building blocks are reasonably simple , their potential for the emergence of very complex behavior on the more macroscopic scales , thus supporting the speculation that such systems may be capable of generating viable continuum theories .",
    "it is now suggestive to regard the edges between pairs of points as describing their ( direct ) interaction .",
    "this becomes more apparent if we impose dynamical network laws on these graph structures so that they become a particular class of discrete dynamical systems .",
    "henceforth we denote such a dynamical network , which is supposed to underly our continuous space - time manifold , by @xmath109 ( `` quantum space '' ) .",
    "we want to make the general remark that the cellular networks , introduced in the following , can either be regarded as mere models of a perhaps more hypothetical character , encoding , or rather simulating , some of the expected features of a surmised quantum space - time or , on the other hand , as a faithful realisation of the primordial substratum , underlying our macroscopic space - time picture .",
    "so far this is a matter of taste .    for the time being we choose , to keep matters reasonably simple , a discrete overall clock - time ( not to be confused with the physical time which is rather supposed to be an emergent and intrinsic characteristic , related to the evolution of quasi - macroscopic patterns in such large and intricately wired networks ) . in principle",
    "the clock - time can also be made into a local dynamical variable .",
    "also the complex of investigations grouped around the phenomenon of synchronization in large populations of coupled oscillators ( a small selection of the existing literature being for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , we assume the node set of our initial network to be fixed and being independent of clock - time ( in contrast to the links ) . this property may however change if we apply the renormalisation process which we described in @xcite .",
    "that is , on the highler levels , the class of lumps or meta - nodes may become dependent on time .    on this network",
    "we now define a dynamical law or a ( clock- ) time evolution .",
    "we assume that each node , @xmath3 , or bond , @xmath110 , carries an internal ( for simplicity ) discrete state space , the internal states being denoted by @xmath111 or @xmath112 . in simple examples we chose for instance : @xmath113 with @xmath114 an elementary quantum of information and @xmath115 in most of the studied cellular automata systems even simpler internal state spaces are chosen like e.g. @xmath116 .",
    "this is at the moment not considered to be a crucial point .",
    "the above choice is only an example .    in our approach",
    "the bond states are dynamical degrees of freedom which , a fortiori , can be switched off or on ( see below ) .",
    "therefore the wiring , that is , the pure geometry ( of relations ) of the network is a clock - time dependent , dynamical property and is not given in advance .",
    "consequently , the nodes and bonds are typically not arranged in a more or less regular array , a regular lattice say , with a fixed near-/far - order .",
    "this implies that geometry will become to some degree a relational ( machian ) concept and is no longer a static background .",
    "as in cellular automata , the node and bond states are updated ( for convenience ) in discrete clock - time steps , @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 being an elementary clock - time interval .",
    "this updating is given by some local dynamical law ( examples are given below ) .",
    "in this context local means that the node / bond states change at each clock time step according to a prescription with input the overall state of a certain neighborhood ( in some topology ) of the node / bond under discussion .",
    "a simple example of such a local dynamical law we are having in mind is given in the following definition ( first introduced in @xcite ) .",
    "at each clock time step a certain _ quantum _ @xmath114 is exchanged between , say , the nodes @xmath3 , @xmath20 , connected by the bond @xmath110 such that @xmath120 ( i.e. if @xmath121 a quantum @xmath114 flows from @xmath20 to @xmath3 etc . ) + the second part of the law describes the _ back reaction _ on the bonds ( and is , typically , more subtle ) .",
    "we assume the existence of two _ critical parameters _ @xmath122 with : @xmath123 @xmath124 with the special proviso that @xmath125 on the other side @xmath126 in other words , bonds are switched off if local spatial charge fluctuations are too large or switched on again if they are too small , their orientation following the sign of local charge differences , or remain inactive .",
    "another interesting law arises if one exchanges the role of @xmath127 and @xmath128 in the above law , that is , bonds are switched off if the local node fluctuations are too small and are switched on again if they exceed @xmath128 .",
    "we make the following observation :    the above dynamical law depends nowhere on the absolute values of the node `` charges '' but only on their relative differences . by the same token ,",
    "charge is nowhere created or destroyed .",
    "we have @xmath129 ( @xmath130 denoting the change in total charge of the network between two consecutive clocktime steps ) . to avoid artificial ambiguities we can e.g. choose a fixed reference level , taking as initial condition at @xmath131 the following constraint @xmath132    we resume what we consider to be the crucial ingredients of network laws , we are interested in    1 .   as in gauge theory or general relativity",
    ", our evolution law should implement the mutual interaction of two fundamental substructures , put a little bit vaguely : `` _ geometry _ '' acting on `` _ matter _ '' and vice versa , where in our context `` _ geometry _ ''",
    "is assumed to correspond in a loose sense to the local and/or global array of bond states and `` _ matter _ '' to the structure of the node states .",
    "2 .   by the same token",
    "the alluded _",
    "selfreferential _ dynamical circuitry of mutual interactions is expected to favor a kind of _ undulating behavior _ or _ selfexcitation _ above a return to some uninteresting _ equilibrium state _ ( being devoid of stable structural details ) , as is frequently the case in systems consisting of a single component which directly acts back on itself .",
    "this propensity for the _ autonomous _ generation of undulation patterns is in our view an essential prerequisite for some form of `` _ protoquantum behavior _ ''",
    "we hope to recover on some coarse grained and less primordial level of the network dynamics .",
    "in the same sense we expect the large scale pattern of switching - on and -off of bonds to generate a kind of `` _ protogravity _ '' .",
    "remark : the above dynamical law shows that bonds with @xmath133 at clock time @xmath134 do not participate in the dynamics in the next time step .",
    "we hence may consider them as being temporally inactive .",
    "the shape of the network , neglecting all the internal states of the nodes and bonds together with the inactive bonds we call the wiring diagram .",
    "if one concentrates solely on this wiring diagram , figure 2 ( below ) describes one clocktime step in the life of a dynamic graph . in the picture only a small subgraph is shown and the deletion and creation of edges ( that is , elementary interactions among nodes or possible information channels ) .",
    "the new bonds are represented as bold lines .",
    "it should be emphasized that the graph is not assumed to be a triangulation of some preexisting smooth manifold .",
    "this is emphasized by the existence of edges , connecting nodes which are not necessarily close with respect to e.g. the euclidean distance .",
    "we recently observed that similar ideas have been entertained within the framework of cellular automata ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) , the models being called structurally dynamic cellular automata or sdca . as far as we can see at the moment ,",
    "the adopted technical framework is not exactly the same but we think , a comparison of both approaches should turn out to be profitable .",
    "we conjecture that such discrete dynamical laws as introduced above may be discrete protoforms of the dynamical laws governing the arrays of coupled nonlinear oscillators in the papers cited previously .",
    "this is corroborated by computer simulations on arrays of several thousand nodes , performed by us in the past ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) which clearly exhibited an amalgamation or superposition of statistical behavior and a collective undulation pattern .",
    "the second law , described above , has in particular extremely short transients , reaching a periodic attractor in a very short time , having the further remarkable property that , given the huge accessible phase space and the complexity of the network states , it has a period of only six .",
    "in this section we want to prepare the stage which will allow us to relate our own approach to quantum space - time structure with the small - world network view , being expounded in , on the surface , quite distinct areas of research .",
    "but in order to keep the exposition of the partly quite intricate technical details within reasonable length , we will mainly refer , as to the technical details , to the two papers , @xcite , @xcite , and try to give here only the general ideas .",
    "the central picture is that , what we experience as a practically continuous space - time manifold , will turn out , under sufficient magnification , as a network of overlapping local clusters or lumps , being superposed by a , in a measure theoretic sense meager or sparse second network connecting these local clusters or lumps in a basically translocal manner .",
    "that means , this second network connects local clusters which may be quite a distance apart with respect to the metrical structure of the network of underlying lumps .",
    "we tried to make more explicit in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite how this double structure is expected to go over , on the macroscopic scale of ordinary space - time physics , into , on the one hand , a smooth local causal space - time plus , on the other hand , a classically almost hidden nonlocal network structure which is , due to the weaker and fluctuating connections , of a more stochastic nature and which we expect to make an effect in many of the notorious quantum phenomena ( note again the parallels to observations in certain social networks mentioned below ) .",
    "this overall picture can be made more precise as follows . to construct this underlying network of lumps ,",
    "our main tool will be a kind of geometric renormalisation group or systematic coarse graining procedure which we developed in @xcite .",
    "to put it briefly , we regard the ordinary space or space - time as a medium having a rich internal nested fine structure , which is however largely hidden on the ordinary macroscopic scales due to the usually low level of resolution of space - time processes as compared to e.g. the planck scale . in the process of coarse graining , described in the following , the resolution of the details of space - time is steadily scaled down from the planck level to the level of ordinary continuum physics .    on the deepest level ,",
    "that is , the planck scale , proto space - time is supposed to be a wildly fluctuating network of dynamic relations or exchange of pieces of information among a given set of nodes . at each fixed clock - time step there",
    "exist certain subclusters of nodes in this initial network which are particularly densely entangled and the whole graph can be covered by this uniquely given set of subclusters of nodes and the respective induced subgraphs ( edges given by overlap of clusters ) .",
    "we dealt with these distinguished clusters of nodes ( called cliques or lumps ) in quite some detail in e.g. @xcite or @xcite and define them in the introductory section on graph concepts .",
    "we emphasize the interesting relations to earlier ideas of menger , rosen et al , which have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "it is fascinating that a similar picture was developed quite some time ago in mathematical sociology ( cf .",
    "@xcite p.14 f and @xcite ) .",
    "these people developed networks consisting of two kinds of ties , they called ( as we did in , for example , @xcite ) weak and strong ties .",
    "the strong ties define closely knitted clusters of friends they call clumps ( similar to our cliques or lumps ) while the weak ties form ( nonlocal ) bridges to aquaintances who are usually not friends of each other but are lying in local clumps of their own , with these clumps non - overlapping with each other . in this work",
    "the role of the weak ties is particularly emphasized , playing a role very similar to the translocal web in our framework . as to the geometric correspondences",
    "compare this picture with a very similar picture we developed in section 5.2 ( cf . in particular fiure 3 ) , being completely unaware of the above work .",
    "technically we need a general principle which allows us to lump together subsets of nodes , living on a certain level of resolution of space - time , to construct the building blocks of the next level of coarse graining ( see below ) . after a series of such coarse graining steps we will wind up with a nested structure of lumps , containing smaller lumps and so forth , which , after appropriate rescaling , may yield in the end some quasi - continuous but nested structure .",
    "this principle is provided by the following mathematical prescription .",
    "it is an important observation that in a generic random graph of order @xmath9 and edge probability @xmath59 the order of cliques is concentrated with very high probability in a relatively small interval @xmath135 ; @xmath136 see @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "that is , each renormalization or coarse graining step consists of the following pieces .    *",
    "starting from a given fixed graph @xmath137 , defining the level zero , pick the ( generic ) cliques , @xmath138 , in @xmath0 , their order lying in the above mentioned interval , @xmath139 . *",
    "these cliques form the new nodes of the clique - graph , @xmath140 of @xmath137 .",
    "the corresponding new edges are drawn between cliques , having a ( sufficient degree of ) overlap .",
    "size , overlap and distribution of cliques in a generic ( random ) graph have been analyzed in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "* that is , both marginal ( i.e. very small ) cliques ( if they do exist at all ) and , more importantly ( as they are more numerous ) , marginal overlaps are deleted . in this respect",
    "a coarse - graining step includes also a certain purification of the graph structure .    what is considered to be a `` sufficient overlap '' depends of course on the physical context and the general working philosophy .",
    "a particular node will in general belong to several , and in the case of densely entangled graphs to many , cliques .",
    "the minimal possible overlap is given by a single common node .",
    "if , on the other hand , the cliques on a certain level of coarse graining are comparatively large , comprising , say , typically several hundred nodes , it may be reasonable to neglect _ marginal _",
    ", i.e. to small , overlaps as physically irrelevant and define a sufficient degree of overlap to consist of an appreciable fraction of the typical clique order .",
    "the numerical effect of such choices have been studied in sect.5 of @xcite .",
    "we call the graph , defined above , the ( purified ) clique graph , @xmath141 , constructed from the initial graph , @xmath0 .",
    "we note in passing that the robustness of , say , the graph property connectedness under these coarse graining steps has been dealt with in sect . 5 of @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that our coarse graining procedure is universal in the sense that the same principles are applied on every level of the renormalization procedure , as the transition from a graph to its clique graph is always a well defined prescription . in the end , after some rescaling of the length unit , we hope to arrive at a ( quasi-)continuous manifold , displaying , under appropriate magnification , an intricate internal fine structure .",
    "this should ( or rather , can only expected to ) happen if the original network has been in a critical state as will be described in the following .    on each level of coarse - graining ,",
    "that is , after each renormalisation step , labelled by @xmath142 , we get , as in the block spin approach to critical phenomena , a new level set of cliques or lumps , @xmath143 , ( @xmath144 labelling the cliques on renormalisation level @xmath18 ) , consisting on their sides of @xmath145-cliques which are the @xmath18-nodes of level @xmath18 , starting from the level @xmath146 with @xmath147 . that is , we have @xmath148 ( @xmath149 denoting the @xmath145-cliques , belonging , as meta nodes , to the @xmath18-clique , @xmath150 ) .",
    "these cliques form the meta nodes in the next step .",
    "the cliques , @xmath151 , of @xmath147 are called zero - cliques .",
    "they become the one - nodes , @xmath152 , of level one , i.e. of @xmath153 .",
    "the one - cliques , @xmath154 , are the cliques in @xmath153 .",
    "they become the 2-nodes , @xmath155 , of @xmath156 etc .",
    "correspondingly , we label the other structural elements , for example , 1-edges , 2-edges or the distance functions , @xmath157 .",
    "these higher - level nodes and edges are also called meta - nodes , -edges , respectively .",
    "the above construction may lead to the wrong impression that the network becomes sparser after each step .",
    "quite to the contrary , the number of cliques in @xmath141 may be much larger than the number of nodes in the original graph , @xmath0 ( cf . the table in section 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "this happens if there is an appreciable overlap among the occurring cliques , that is , a given node may belong to many different cliques . on the other hand , after several renormalisation steps , the picture usually seems to become stable in the generic case ( see subsect .",
    "5.2 of @xcite ) .",
    "we illustrate the preceding remarks with a couple of numerical results .",
    "starting , as in @xcite , from an initial network with the parameters , @xmath158 , which implies @xmath159 and taking as sufficient overlap of cliques a value of , say , fifty , we get after the first coarse graining step the new parameters on level one : + @xmath160 : @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 , average vertex degree @xmath164 + we see that after only one step the typical cliques are already very small .",
    "therefore , in the next step , an overlap greater or equal to one is appropriate , that is we can use the ordinary clique graph instead of the purified clique graph and get on the second level : + @xmath165 : @xmath166 ( number of cliques on level one ) , @xmath167 , @xmath168 + we convinced ourselves that the qualitative picture will no longer change under further renormalisation steps .",
    "+ remark : we note that the above choice of parameters is not really crucial .",
    "the qualitative picture will essentially remain the same for other choices ( cf . section 5 of @xcite ) .",
    "we briefly resume the picture we tried to convey in this subsection .",
    "we argued that , what we regard as the building blocks of our physical space - time continuum and what we dubbed physical points in previous work , have actually a nested internal structure which is built up , starting from the planck scale , via the renormalisation steps , described above .",
    "on the other hand , we want to emphasize that such a continuum as a fixed point or limit state is far from being a quasi automatic consequence of our procedure .",
    "quite to the contrary , the initial network has to be in a very peculiar critical state , see sect.8 of @xcite , embodying a kind of seemingly scale free translocal order as being described , for example , in a different context by barabasi et al ( @xcite ) .",
    "this subsection mainly refers to @xcite , but we deal primarily with the ( random ) graph aspects which can be found in sect.6 of @xcite .",
    "we assume that on a certain scale , @xmath18 , of our renormalisation process , the network of lumps , @xmath169 , is sufficiently close to the continuous limit manifold , @xmath170 .",
    "we take its meta - nodes , i.e. the cliques , @xmath171 , of level @xmath145 as an approximation of the physical points of @xmath170 .",
    "this clique graph of level @xmath18 ( i.e. after @xmath18 coarse graining steps have been performed ) carries a natural graph metric , @xmath172 , which is given by the natural distance between the meta nodes ( or cliques ) , @xmath173 ( with edges given by sufficient overlap ) .",
    "if one wants to , one can relate this integer - valued ( grainy ) distance functional to a continuous distance function between the corresponding ( fuzzy ) physical points , @xmath174 of the associated continuous manifold ( which , in this approach , may be viewed rather as a mental construct ) with @xmath175 for more details as to these aspects see @xcite.we want to focus our attention in the following on another somewhat hidden but very important aspect of the construction .    by assumption",
    "we draw an edge between a pair of cliques , @xmath173 , if they have a certain degree of overlap of common nodes .",
    "this has the effect that all edges which may exist between nodes lying in @xmath173 , respectively , are deleted in the next step if these cliques have empty or too marginal overlap .",
    "that is , these cliques , occurring as meta nodes of the following level are now unrelated in the next step whereas there may still exist a certain ( limited ) amount of information exchange on the preceding , more fine grained levels .",
    "in this sense information will also be coarse grained with only sufficiently robust information surviving the process .",
    "in subsection 5.2 of @xcite we made a detailed ( numerical ) analysis of these effects of renormalisation . among other things we calculated , depending on the edge probability @xmath59 , the typical cardinality of the local group of a given clique , @xmath176 , i.e. the number of cliques having an overlap with @xmath176 bigger than some prescribed number , the typical cardinality of the cliques on the consecutive levels , the level - dependent edge probability and vertex degree and so on .",
    "we made the important observation that already after a few steps the whole picture becomes relatively stationary , implying that the idea of a stationary limit phase is perhaps not so far - fetched .",
    "what we have discussed so far is the local structure or near order aspect of the network which becomes more and more apparent as a consequence of the consecutive coarse graining steps .",
    "we showed also in @xcite that this process leads to an unfolding of the initially densely entangled network towards a network having a large average distance or diameter similar to a local network in contrast to a typical random graph .",
    "we infer that in contrast to the initial graph , @xmath137 , in which a large portion of the vertices is directly connected , most of the cliques of @xmath177 , i.e. nodes of the first level @xmath153 , are no longer directly connected . on the other hand , many of the nodes lying in , say , the non - overlapping cliques , @xmath173 are connected by edges of the initial graph @xmath177",
    ".    another important consequence of our analysis is that practically all occurring cliques are lying in the above interval @xmath139 with @xmath159 in our example .",
    "this implies that essentially every edge in @xmath177 belongs to at least one such large clique .",
    "put differently , with @xmath173 two cliques , having a large distance in @xmath153 , and @xmath4 some edge connecting two nodes in @xmath173 respectively , @xmath4 almost certainly belongs to another large clique of roughly the same order .",
    "this conclusion makes the global picture both intricate and interesting .",
    "we try to express this situation in the following picture    the circles denote some generic cliques which are assumed to have sufficient overlap with ( some of ) their neighbors .",
    "a part of another clique ( denoted by @xmath42 ) , assumed to be of more or less the same order , but having only weak bonds ( i.e. , weak overlap ) with these possibly widely separated local neighborhood clusters , is represented by thin lines .    on the other hand",
    ", we learned from our numerical estimates ( see also below ) that , typically , also clique @xmath42 will have its own local group , that is , cliques with strong overlap .",
    "in other words , this particular clique @xmath42 is almost shurely the member of another local group of roughly the same shape , but lying in another region of the manifold , @xmath170 .",
    "this situation is described in the picture on the right , with the weak bonds between the three local groups , represented on the left and the clique @xmath42 depicted by dashed lines .",
    "the clique @xmath42 is now represented as a member of another local group of generic cliques .",
    "summing up our observations we can conclude that , even if we start from a densely entangled random graph , we typically arrive after only a few renormalisation steps at a coarse grained network displaying both a markedly local behavior in form of strongly coupled local clusters and a superposed sparser network of a different , translocal character , with links spreading like a spider web over the whole underlying local network .",
    "we note that these findings exhibit a strong resemblance to the small world scale free networks discussed previously .",
    "we underpin this speculation with a variety of analytic results in the following section .",
    "as we remarked above , random graphs have a vertex degree distribution which is of a binomial , and , in a certain limit , of poisson type .",
    "in contrast to such graphs , barabasi et al observed that certain classes of concrete networks are not of this type but instead are of scale - free type ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "this means , the vertex degrees are ( asymptotically ) distributed according to a power law @xmath178    geometrically such a distribution is related to the existence of a certain portion of hubs in the networks , that is , nodes having an unusually large number of links .",
    "however , this is not sufficient in general .",
    "the network has to be hierarchically organised so that these short cuts do exist on consecutive levels of coarse graining as described by us in the preceding section .",
    "one therefore may suppose that scale - free networks represent a subclass of small world networks with clusters in clusters in clusters and so on . in the following",
    "we will corroborate this hypothesis with a number of analytic results .",
    "an important conceptual tool in the analysis of the large scale behavior of graphs of order , @xmath9 , near or at infinity , is the distance degree sequence , @xmath179 , relative to an arbitrary but fixed node , @xmath98 ( @xcite,@xcite ) . in @xcite",
    "we gave arguments that its scaling behavior is closely related to a geometric characteristic of spaces or , rather , systems ( in physics ) which may be identified with the concept of intrinsic dimension .",
    "we use the adjective ` intrinsic ' to distinguish the concept from the more common concept of ` embedding dimension ' .",
    "in contrast to the latter it encodes the intrinsic geometrical or relational organisation of the system itself and not the lesser important structure of the ambient space .",
    "let @xmath98 be an arbitrary node of @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath180 denote the number of nodes in @xmath181.we consider the sequence of real numbers @xmath182 .",
    "we say @xmath183 is the _ lower _ and @xmath184 the _ upper internal scaling dimension _ of g starting from @xmath98 . if @xmath185 we say @xmath0 has internal scaling dimension @xmath186 starting from @xmath98 . finally , if @xmath187 @xmath188 , we simply say @xmath0 has _",
    "internal scaling dimension @xmath189_.    let @xmath98 again be an arbitrary node of @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath190 denot the number of nodes in the boundary of @xmath181 ( in our previous notation @xmath191 ) .",
    "we set @xmath192 and define @xmath193 as the _ lower _ and @xmath194 as the _ upper connectivity dimension_. if lower and upper dimension coincide , we say @xmath0 has _ connectivity dimension _",
    "@xmath195 _ starting from _ @xmath98 . if @xmath196 for all @xmath98 we call @xmath197 simply the _ connectivity dimension _ of @xmath0",
    ".    the two definitions are not strictly equivalent but coincide in the more regular situations . in the following , for the sake of brevity",
    ", we only use the first notion . like",
    "fractal dimension the above definitions coincide with the usual ( embedding ) dimension for the more regular situations like e.g. lattice graphs .",
    "it is remarkable that our concept of graph or network dimension is stable under a variety of graph transformations or deformations , in particular local ones ( @xcite,@xcite ) . in the following we want to concentrate on one particular aspect , namely the relevance of a dimensional analysis in connection with critical network states .",
    "these we will associate later with small world scale - free networks .      assuming that @xmath0 has dimension @xmath198 and globally bounded node degree , @xmath199 , we have that @xmath200 also exists and it holds @xmath201 note that this result does hold for the ordinary clique graph , viz .",
    "arbitrary overlap , viz .",
    ", no purification . in other words",
    ", under these assumptions , the renormalisation steps do not change the graph dimension .",
    "this result is reminiscent of a similar observation in statistical mechanics where the non - coarse - grained gibbsian entropy happens to be a constant of motion .",
    "the same happens here . in the ordinary clique graph",
    "each original bond occurs in at least one clique , i.e. there is no real ( or , more precisely , not enough ) coarse graining .",
    "note that there are two important assumptions underlying the above result .",
    "first , the node degree is assumed to be globally bounded .",
    "second , there has been no coarse graining .",
    "if we allow for purification , we have the following weaker result .",
    "having for example the picture in mind , frequently invoked by wheeler and others , of a space - time foam , with a concept of dimension depending on the scale of resolution ( see e.g. box 44.4 on p.1205 in @xcite ) , we infer from our above observations that this may turn out to be both an interesting and not entirely trivial topic .",
    "we have to analyze under what specific conditions the dimension can actually shrink under coarse - graining , so that we may start from a very erratic network on , say , the planck scale , and arrive in the end at a smooth macroscopic space - time having perhaps an integer dimension of , preferably , value 4 or so .",
    "while the above corollary seems to allow in principle that space- or network dimension may become smaller under coarse graining , the following remarkable result shows that this is not so easily acchieved . on the other hand ,",
    "it gives strong clues as to the kind of ( critical ) network states which actually do admit a decrease of dimension under purification .        from this",
    "we learn the following .",
    "phase transitions in graphs , changing the dimension , have to be intrinsically non - local . that is , they necessarily involve nodes , having an arbitrarily large distance in the original graph .",
    "we think , this is a crucial observation from the physical point of view .",
    "it shows that systems have to be critical in a peculiar way , that is , having a lot of distant correlations or , rather , correlations on all scales ( cf . also smolins s discussion in e.g. @xcite and elsewhere ) .    in the preceding proposition we made the transition from a graph , @xmath0 , to a graph @xmath208 living on the same node set but having more edges with the special proviso",
    "that edge insertions take only place between pairs of nodes , @xmath209 , having @xmath210 in the purification process we are rather interested in edge deletions !",
    "these two processes are however not ! strictly symmetric",
    ".    under edge insertions the distance between nodes does not increase , i.e. @xmath211 on the other hand , edge deletions may lead to @xmath212 if we want to employ the above proposition also in the case of edge deletions , we have to guarantee that edges in @xmath208 between nodes , @xmath213 , may be deleted under the proviso that @xmath214 . the condition @xmath215 would not suffice .",
    "if we apply these findings to our renormalisation steps , that is , passing from a graph to its associated ( purified ) clique graph , this implies the following .",
    "we saw that assuming a network or graph , @xmath0 , having a dimension , @xmath198 , the unpurified clique graph still has @xmath201 on the other hand , denoting for the moment the purified clique graph by @xmath216 , we have the estimate @xmath217    the transition from @xmath141 to @xmath216 consists of the deletion of marginal overlaps among cliques ( with the necessary criteria provided by the physical context ) .",
    "that is , @xmath216 lives on the same node set ( the set of cliques ) but has fewer ( meta)bonds .",
    "the above proposition shows that this does not automatically guarantee that we really have @xmath218 quite to the contrary , we learned that this can only be achieved if the bond deletions happen in a very specific way .",
    "on @xmath141 we have , as on any graph , a natural distance or neighborhood structure , given by the canonical graph metric , @xmath219 .",
    "we thus infer that edge deletions in @xmath141 between cliques which are not very far apart in the final purified graph @xmath216 can not alter the final dimension of @xmath216 . more precisely",
    ", only edge deletions between cliques having distances in @xmath216 which approach infinity in a specific way , can have an effect .",
    "the preceding observation fits into the picture one invokes in the context of critical behavior and scale freeness in , for example , statistical mechanics .",
    "furthermore it seems to be closely related to the kind of scale freeness of networks as observed by barabasi et al . in the last section of @xcite we gave a simple but , as we think , instructive example in which the effects of edge deletions on all scales as the origin of dimensional change can explicitly be studied .",
    "the example consists of the one - dimensional ( discrete ) line , @xmath220 , being embedded in @xmath221 in a particular way , so that the corresponding edge deletions lead to a dimensional change from @xmath221 to @xmath220 .",

    "<S> such a fixed point can however only emerge if the network on the planck scale has very peculiar critical geometric properties which strongly resemble the phenomena observed in the above mentioned networks . </S>",
    "<S> a particularly noteworthy phenomenon is the appearance of translocal bridges or short cuts connecting widely separated regions of ordinary space - time and which we expect to become relevant in various of the notorious quantum riddles .    </S>",
