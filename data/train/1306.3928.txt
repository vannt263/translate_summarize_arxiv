    "many physical processes in science are described by models using differential equations .",
    "it is a well - known fact that the theory of semigroups of operators on banach spaces represents a powerful tool for solving many classical differential equations ( see e.g. @xmath4 $ ] ) .",
    "nowadays , differential equations are classified by the different approaches used in order to deal with them : ( i ) deterministic ( ii ) random or stochastic and ( iii ) fuzzy - like . the class ( i )",
    "is by far the most studied .",
    "the second class is usually employed when a deterministic description of the model is not strictly justifiable .",
    "however , the first or second descriptions often represent an idealization of real - world situations when imprecision or lack of information in the modelling of the physical process may in fact play a significant role .",
    "indeed , it was this uncertainty or vagueness of the modelling in certain physical processes that suggested the introduction of the so - called fuzzy differential equations [ 3 - 4 ] , whose solutions represent fuzzy - number - valued functions .",
    "the goal of this paper is to develop , in section @xmath5 the theory of the semigroups of operators on spaces of fuzzy - number - valued functions . in section 4 ,",
    "our goal is to apply this theory to several classes of fuzzy differential equations .",
    "the main difficulty of dealing with fuzzy differential equations is the fact that the spaces of fuzzy numbers and fuzzy - number - valued functions are not linear spaces . in particular",
    ", they are not groups with respect to addition and the scalar multiplication is not , in general , distributive with respect to usual addition of scalars .",
    "however , they are complete metric spaces with their metrics having nice properties .",
    "these features allow us to develop a consistent operator theory . to give a better idea of what we are aiming for ,",
    "let us recall that , as in the classical cases ( i ) and ( ii ) , many inhomogeneous fuzzy differential equations ( iii ) can be recasted into the form of an abstract cauchy problem of the form@xmath6\\oplus g\\left ( t\\right ) , \\text { } t\\in i , \\\\ u\\left ( t_{0}\\right ) & = u_{0},\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath7 is an interval , @xmath8 @xmath9 , @xmath10 is a linear bounded operator on @xmath11 and @xmath12 is continuous , where @xmath13 is a complete metric space .",
    "our goal is to show that , as in the classical case , the following variation of parameter formula@xmath14always furnishes a solution to the fuzzy cauchy problem .",
    "furthermore , we also provide the mean for constructing @xmath15 as follows:@xmath16where @xmath17 is the sum with respect to @xmath18 finally , we apply this formula on some specific examples and show that it always provides the correct answer in the sense that the solutions we construct in the fuzzy case contain additional terms which in the crisp case completely disappear .",
    "it is worth mentioning that one can easily formulate the classical liapunov stability theorem for @xmath19 in this form .",
    "while the above formula provides a constructive mean to obtain solutions , the following important questions still remain open : in the generic case is the solution of the above cauchy problem unique , and if so , does it depend continuously on the initial data ?",
    "in this section we present the main properties of the space of fuzzy numbers and of some other spaces based on it and which have similar properties . given a set @xmath20 a fuzzy subset of @xmath21 is a mapping @xmath22 $ ] and obviously any classical subset of @xmath21 can be identified as a fuzzy subset of @xmath21 defined by @xmath23 , \\chi _ { a}\\left ( x\\right ) = 1 $ ] if @xmath24 if @xmath25 if @xmath22 $ ] is a fuzzy subset of @xmath11 then for @xmath26 @xmath27 is called the membership degree of @xmath28 to @xmath29 ( see e.g. @xmath30 $ ] ) .",
