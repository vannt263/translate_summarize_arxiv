    "the production of strange particles is considered one of the key observables for understanding the reaction mechanisms in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "enhanced strangeness production with respect to proton - proton collisions was originally proposed as a signature of the transition to a deconfined state of quarks and gluons during the initial stage of the reactions  @xcite .",
    "the enhancement was predicted to arise from gluon fragmentation into quark - antiquark pairs which is believed to have a significantly lower threshold than strange - antistrange hadron pair production channels .",
    "indeed , it has been observed  @xcite that the ratio of the number of produced kaons to that of pions is higher by a factor of about 2 in central s + s and pb + pb reactions than that in @xmath2 collisions at the top energy available at the cern super proton synchroton ( sps ) .",
    "statistical hadron gas models have been successfully employed to describe the measured particle yields at various collision energies  @xcite .",
    "the fact that the hadronic final state of the collision resembles a hadron gas in chemical equilibrium has been interpreted as a consequence of the hadronization process  @xcite or as a result of a fast hadronic equilibration process involving multiparticle collisions  @xcite . in this hadron gas picture ,",
    "enhanced production of strange particles in collisions of large nuclei arises as a consequence of the increased reaction volume , relaxing the influence of strangeness conservation  @xcite .",
    "technically , this requires the application of the canonical ensemble to small collision systems , while for larger volumes such as those encountered in central collisions of heavy ions , the grand - canonical approximation is valid . it has been shown that this `` canonical strangeness suppression '' also applies to a partonic system  @xcite .",
    "in addition to this volume effect , the strange particle phase space appears to be undersaturated in elementary interactions .",
    "the deviation of the strange particle yields from a hadron gas in full equilibrium was parametrized by a strangeness undersaturation factor @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "the additional suppression becomes much weaker in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "however , fits to the hadron multiplicities in full phase space are still unsatisfactory when not taking into account @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "a possible interpretation is that the total amount of strangeness available for hadronization is determined in a prehadronic stage of the collision .",
    "a change in @xmath3 between @xmath2 and @xmath4 would then reflect the difference in the initial conditions of the respective fireballs .",
    "the hadron gas model was extended to describe the energy dependence of produced hadron multiplicities by a smooth parametrization of the fit parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 , determined at energies available at the bnl alternating gradient synchroton ( ags ) , sps , and bnl relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , as a function of collision energy  @xcite . however , this extended model failed to reproduce the detailed features of the energy dependence of relative strangeness production measured by na49 in its energy scan program .",
    "in particular , the sharp maximum at around 30@xmath1  gev beam energy  @xcite could not be described .",
    "the same holds true for microscopic reaction models such as urqmd  @xcite . on the other hand , this feature was predicted as a consequence of the onset of a phase transition to a deconfined state at the respective beam energy  @xcite .    in this context , it is certainly interesting to investigate specific strangeness - carrying hadrons . among these ,",
    "the @xmath0 meson is of particular interest because of its @xmath7 valence quark composition . in a purely hadronic scenario ,",
    "being strangeness - neutral , it should not be sensitive to hadrochemical effects related to strangeness .",
    "if on the other hand , the amount of available strange quarks is determined in a partonic stage of the collision , the @xmath0 is expected to react more sensitively than singly strange particles . in particular , one would expect the @xmath0 meson yield to be suppressed by @xmath8 with respect to equilibrium .",
    "analogously , the canonical suppression mechanism in small systems should have a stronger effect on the @xmath0 , leading to a larger relative enhancement in pb + pb collisions with respect to @xmath2 reactions than observed for kaons .    in the evolution of the fireball after hadronization , @xmath0 mesons",
    "can be both formed by kaon coalescence and destroyed by rescattering .",
    "in addition , when decaying inside the fireball , the daughter particles can rescatter , leading to a loss of signal in the invariant mass peak of the respective decay channel .",
    "this is more likely to happen for slow @xmath0 mesons , which spend more time in the fireball .",
    "thus the effect could lead to a depletion of the @xmath0 meson yield at low @xmath9 in central nucleus - nucleus collisions @xcite .",
    "theoretical investigations have suggested that the properties of the @xmath0 meson might be modified in a dense hadronic medium . in particular , a decrease of its mass of the order of 10  mev , throughout this article . ]",
    "@xcite and an increase of its width by a factor of 23  @xcite were predicted .",
    "so far , there is only one experimental claim for a broadening of the width in @xmath10 + cu collisions  @xcite .    in an earlier publication  @xcite",
    ", we reported on @xmath0 production at top sps energy , where we found the @xmath0 enhanced by a factor of about 3 , compared to minimum bias @xmath2 collisions at the same beam energy . meanwhile , the @xmath0 meson was measured at the same energy by the na50  @xcite , na45  @xcite , and na60  @xcite experiments . at the ags , data on @xmath0 production were obtained by the e917 collaboration in au + au collisions at @xmath11 gev ( @xmath12 gev ) in a restricted rapidity range @xmath13 $ ]  @xcite . at the rhic , the star collaboration measured the @xmath0 meson at @xmath14 and @xmath15  gev at midrapidity  @xcite .",
    "for the latter energy , data are also available from the phenix experiment  @xcite .    in this article , we report on @xmath0 production in central pb+pb collisions at five different beam energies from 20@xmath1 to 158@xmath1  gev . together with the data obtained at the ags and the rhic , our findings enable the study of energy dependence of @xmath0 production over a large range of collision energies .",
    "the na49 experiment at cern is based on a fixed - target hadron spectrometer using heavy - ion beams from the sps accelerator .",
    "its main components are four large - volume time projection chambers for charged - particle tracking , two of which operate inside the magnetic field of two superconducting magnets , thus providing an excellent momentum measurement .",
    "two larger main time projection chambers ( mtpcs ) are placed downstream , outside of the field , and enable particle identification by the measurement of the specific energy loss in the detector gas .",
    "the particle identification capabilities are enhanced by a time - of - flight ( tof ) scintillator system behind the mtpcs , albeit in a restricted geometrical acceptance .",
    "a thin lead foil with @xmath16 interaction probability for pb nuclei was used as a target . for the different runs ,",
    "the magnetic field was scaled proportionally to the beam energies in order to have similar acceptance in the c.m .  system .",
    "the centrality of the reactions was determined from the energy deposited by the beam spectators in the zero - degree calorimeter , placed 20 m downstream of the target . by setting an upper limit on this energy ,",
    "the online central trigger selected the 7.2% most central collisions at @xmath17@xmath18  gev and the 10% most central collisions at 158@xmath1  gev .",
    "the latter data set was restricted to 5% centrality in the offline analysis .",
    "the corresponding mean numbers of wounded nucleons were obtained by glauber model calculations ( see table  [ tab : datasets ] ) .",
    "details of the experimental apparatus can be found in ref .",
    "offline quality criteria were applied to the events selected by the online centrality trigger to suppress nontarget interactions , pileup , and incorrectly reconstructed events .",
    "the cut variables include the position and @xmath19 of the reconstructed vertex and the track multiplicity .",
    "for the central data sets used in this analysis , however , the impact of these quality cuts is marginal ; only about 1% of all events were rejected .",
    "table  [ tab : datasets ] shows the event statistics used in the analysis for the five data sets .",
    "the analysis was restricted to tracks reconstructed in the mtpcs which could be assigned to the primary vertex . a minimal track length of 2  m out of the maximal 4  m in the mtpcs was required to suppress ghost or split tracks and to ensure a good resolution in @xmath20 .",
    "detailed studies including reconstruction of simulated tracks embedded into real raw data events showed that for such a selection of tracks , losses due to track reconstruction and high track density are negligible .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     all results obtained at 158@xmath1  gev are consistent within statistical errors with na49 results published earlier  @xcite , which were obtained from a data set taken in 1995 ( squared symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : yspectra](e ) .",
    "the main difference of the two data sets is an improved @xmath20 resolution , resulting in a reduced pion contamination of the kaon candidate sample .",
    "the cleaner kaon identification reduces the distortions in the background - subtracted invariant - mass spectrum induced by resonances with a pion as decay daughter  @xcite , thus leading to a smaller systematic error of the breit - wigner fit to the spectrum .",
    "we thus prefer to use the newly obtained results at 158@xmath1  gev for the discussion .",
    "the enhancement of relative strangeness production in heavy - ion collisions with respect to proton - proton reactions is a well - known fact . in an earlier publication  @xcite , the enhancement factor for the @xmath0 meson at top sps energy",
    "was found to be @xmath21 , thus larger than for kaons and @xmath22 , but smaller than for multistrange hyperons .",
    "we calculate the @xmath0 enhancement by normalizing the measured @xmath0 meson yield in @xmath4 by the number of wounded nucleon pairs and dividing by the corresponding yield in @xmath2 . for the lower beam energies , no reference measurements in elementary collisions are available . here",

    ", the value of @xmath26 lies between 3 and 4 , and within our experimental uncertainties we find no systematic variation here . at rhic energies , the enhancement appears to be lower , significantly so , should the phenix result be validated .",

    "the shaded boxes represent the systematic errors . ]    in the context of statistical models , the enhancement of strangeness production can be interpreted as a result of the release of suppression due to strangeness conservation when going from small ( @xmath2 ) to large ( central @xmath4 ) systems .",
    "technically , this is reflected in the application of the canonical ensemble for small systems , while large systems can be described by the grand - canonical ensemble . in this picture ,",
    "a smaller enhancement at rhic energies points to the fact that at such high energies , strangeness is produced with sufficient abundance for the canonical suppression to be relaxed even in @xmath2 collisions .",
    "however , in a purely hadronic picture , canonical suppression does not act on the @xmath0 meson because it is a strangeness - neutral hadron .",
    "enhanced @xmath0 production can thus be attributed either to enhanced strangeness production in a partonic stage of the collision or to the coalescence of kaons which suffer canonical suppression also in a hadronic scenario .",
    "the hadrochemical models have been extended not only to fit hadron multiplicities for a given reaction but also to describe the energy dependence of particle yield ratios by a smooth variation of the relevant parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 with collision energy  @xcite . here , the energy dependence of temperature and baryochemical potential is obtained by a parametrization of the values for @xmath5 and @xmath6 obtained from fits to particle yield ratios at various collision energies .",
