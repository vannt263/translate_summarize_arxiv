    "despite the complexities of structure formation in a @xmath5cdm universe , galaxies are well - regulated systems . strong evidence supporting this statement are the many fundamental relations to which galaxies adhere : star formation rate versus stellar mass or gas density @xcite , rotational velocity versus luminosity or baryonic mass for disks @xcite , the fundamental plane for spheroids @xcite , and the mass of a central compact object versus galaxy mass @xcite , to name several",
    ". moreover , many of these relations are preserved within galaxy groups and clusters , demonstrating that such regulation is maintained in all environments @xcite .",
    "this paper focusses on the relationship between color and luminosity for quiescent [ `` quenched '' ] galaxies : the so - called red sequence [ rs ] .",
    "first identified by @xcite and @xcite , the rs represents one side of the broader phenomenon of galaxy color bimodality @xcite , the other half being the blue cloud , with the green valley separating them .",
    "based on the idea of passively evolving stellar populations , color bimodality is widely interpreted as an evolutionary sequence where galaxies transform their cold gas into stars within the blue cloud and move to the rs after star formation ends @xcite .",
    "this evolution has been partly observed through the increase of mass density along the rs towards low redshift @xcite , although the underlying physics of quenching remains a matter of active research .",
    "the standard view of color bimodality is a bit simplistic though insofar as the evolution does not strictly proceed in one direction ; a fraction of galaxies in the rs or green valley have their stellar populations temporarily rejuvenated by replenishment of their cold gas reservoirs @xcite .",
    "crucial to our understanding of the rs is knowing when and how it formed . the downsizing phenomenon uncovered by spectroscopic analyses of nearby early - type galaxies ( etgs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) implies that the rs was built over an extended period of time [ @xmath15 gyr ] , beginning with the most massive systems @xcite .",
    "these results support the common interpretation that the slope of the rs is caused by a decline in the metallicity [ foremost ] and age of the constituent stellar populations towards lower galaxy masses @xcite .",
    "efforts to directly detect the formation of the rs have observed color bimodality to @xmath1 2 @xcite .",

    "growth in the stellar mass density of quiescent galaxies since = 1 , on the other hand , has occured at mass scales of @xmath7 and lower @xcite , consistent with downsizing .",
    "owing to their richness , concentration , and uniform member distances , galaxy clusters are an advantageous environment for studying the rs .",
    "moreover , their characteristically high densities likely promote quenching and therefore hasten the transition of galaxies to the rs . in terms of formation",

    "the increase in this ratio with redshift indicates that low - mass galaxies populate the rs at later times than high - mass systems , meaning that the former , on average , take longer to quench and/or are depleted via mergers / stripping at early epochs .",
    "these results are not without controversy , however , with some arguing that the inferred evolution may be the result of selection bias , small samples , or not enough redshift baseline @xcite .    as a tracer of star formation activity and stellar populations",

    "our study of the rs in the core of virgo is enabled by the ngvs @xcite .",
    "briefly , the ngvs is an optical imaging survey of the virgo cluster performed with cfht / megacam .",
    "imaging was obtained in the ui  bands over a 104 deg@xmath12 footprint centered on sub - clusters a and b , reaching out to their respective virial radii ( 1.55 and 0.96 mpc , respectively , for an assumed distance of 16.5 mpc ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the ngvs also obtained band imaging for an area of 3.71 deg@xmath12 [ 0.3 mpc@xmath12 ] , roughly centered on m87 , the galaxy at the dynamical center of sub - cluster a ; we refer to this as the core region .",
    "ngvs images have a uniform limiting surface brightness of @xmath129 mag arcsec@xmath14 .",
    "further details on the acquisition and reduction strategies for the ngvs are provided in @xcite .",
    "this paper focuses on the core of the cluster , whose boundaries are defined as ,    @xmath15@xmath16@xmath17@xmath18@xmath19    and encompass four megacam pointings [ see figure 13 of f16 ] .",
    "a catalog of 404 galaxies for this area , of which 154 are new detections , is published in f16 , spanning the range 8.9 @xmath3  @xmath3 23.7 and @xmath2050% complete to  @xmath1 22 . as demonstrated there , the galaxy photometry has been thoroughly analysed and cluster membership extensively vetted for this region ; below we provide a basic summary of these endeavors .",
    "a study of the cmd covering the entire survey volume will be presented in a future contribution .",
    "faint [  @xmath8 16 ] extended sources in the core were identified using a dedicated pipeline based on ring - filtering of the megacam stacks .",
    "ring - filtering replaces pixels contaminated by bright , point - like sources with the median of pixels located just beyond the seeing disk .",
    "this algorithm helps overcome situations of low surface brightness sources being segmented into several parts due to contamination . the list of candidates is then culled and assigned membership probabilities by analysing sextractor and galfit @xcite parameters in the context of a size versus surface brightness diagram , colors and structural scaling relations , and photometric redshifts . a final visual inspection of the candidates and the stacks themselves is made to address issues of false - positives , pipeline failures , and missed detections .",
    "after this , the remaining candidates are assigned a membership flag indicating their status as either certain , likely , or possible members .        as part of their photometric analysis , f16 measured surface brightness profiles and non - parametric structural quantities in the ui  bands for the core galaxies with the iraf task ellipse .",
    "these data products are complemented with similar metrics from srsic fits to both the light profiles and image cutouts for each source [ the latter achieved with galfit ] .",
    "our work is based on the growth curves deduced by applying their [ non - parametric ] band isophotal solutions to all other bands while using a common master mask .",
    "this allows us to investigate changes in the rs as a function of galactocentric radius , rather than rely on a single aperture .",
    "@xcite adopted a similar approach for their cmd analysis , finding that bimodality was more pronounced using core versus global colors ; our results support this point [ see ] .",
    "we extract from the growth curves all ten colors covered by the ngvs , integrated within elliptical apertures having semi - major axes of @xmath21  [  = band effective radius ] , where @xmath22 = 0.5 , 1.0 , 2.0 , 3.0 ; we also examine colors corresponding to the total light of these galaxies .",
    "errors are estimated following @xcite , using the magnitude differences between f16 s growth curve and srsic analyses , and scaling values for each set of apertures by the fraction of light enclosed .",
    "these estimates should probably be regarded as lower limits , since they do not capture _ all _ sources of systematic uncertainty .",
    "absolute magnitudes are computed assuming a uniform distance of 16.5 mpc @xcite for all galaxies and corrected for reddening using the york extinction solver @xcite , adopting the @xcite dust maps , @xcite extinction law , and @xmath23 = 3.07 . to help gauge the intrinsic scatter along the rs , we use recovered magnitudes for @xmath140k artificial galaxies injected into the image stacks [ f16 ] to establish statistical errors in our total light measurements .",
    "a more focussed discussion of uncertainties in the ngvs galaxy photometry may be found in @xcite and f16 .",
    "we note that , although the ngvs is well - suited for their detection , ultra - compact dwarfs [ ucds ] are excluded from our galaxy sample for two reasons . first , they have largely been omitted from previous analyses of the rs .",
    "second , the nature of these objects is unsettled . while many are likely the remnants of tidally - stripped galaxies @xcite , the contribution of large gcs to this population remains unclear .",
    "readers interested in the photometric properties of the ucd population uncovered by the ngvs are referred to @xcite for those found in the core region ; still , we include ucds in our comparisions of the colors of rs galaxies and css in .",
    "a plots the ( u ) colors , integrated within 1.0 , of _ all _ 404 galaxies in the core of virgo as a function of their total band magnitudes .",
    "one of the most striking features in this plot is the depth to which we probe galaxy colors : at its 50%-completeness limit [ @xmath1 9 ] , the ngvs luminosity function reaches levels that have only been previously achieved in the local group [ comparable to the carina dsph , and only slightly brighter than draco ; @xcite ] .",
    "this is significant as integrated colors for dwarf galaxies at these scales have , until now , been highly biased to the local volume [ @xmath24 4 mpc ] , incomplete , and noisy @xcite .",
    "the ngvs cmd therefore represents the most extensive one to date based on homogeneous photometry , spanning a factor of @xmath25 in luminosity .",
    "also interesting about a is the dearth of blue galaxies in the core of virgo .",
    "this is more apparent in b , where we plot histograms of ( u ) in four bins of luminosity .",
    "three of the four samples are well described as unimodal populations rather than the bimodal color distributions typically found in large galaxy surveys @xcite .",
    "the absence of a strong color bimodality in virgo s core is not surprising though @xcite and suggests that most of these galaxies have been cluster members long enough to be quenched by the environment2 gyr ; @xcite , and references therein ; @xcite ) and others longer ( several gyr ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "galaxy mass and possible delay times likely factor into this disagreement . ] . the minority of blue galaxies we find may be members that are currently making their first pericentric passage or are non - core members projected along the line - of - sight .",
    "since our interest lies in the rs , we have inspected three - color images for every galaxy and exclude from further analysis 24 that are clearly star - forming [ blue points in a ] .",
    "also excluded are the 56 galaxies that fall below our completeness limit [ grey points ] , 16 whose imaging suffers from significant contamination [  scattered light from bright stars ; green points ] , and 4 that are candidate remnants of tidal stripping [ red points ] . while we can not rule out a contribution by reddening to the colors of the remaining galaxies , their three - color images do not indicate a significant frequency of dust lanes .",
    "plots all ten cmds for quiescent galaxy candidates in virgo s core , where the colors again correspond to 1.0 .",
    "having culled the star - forming galaxies , we can straightforwardly study the shape of the rs as a function of wavelength . in each panel of we observe a clear trend , whereby for @xmath26 14 , colors become bluer towards fainter magnitudes . to help trace this",
    ", we have run the locally weighted scatterplot smoothing algorithm ( lowess ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on each cmd ; these fits are represented by the red lines in the figure .",
    "the observed trends are notable given that optical colors are marginally sensitive to the metallicities of composite stellar populations with @xmath27 .",
    "simple comparisons of our lowess curves to stellar population models suggests that , for @xmath26 14 , metallicity increases with luminosity along the rs [ see ] ; age trends are harder to discern with the colors available to us .",
    "a metallicity - luminosity relation for rs galaxies agrees with previous work on the stellar populations of etgs throughout virgo @xcite and the quiescent galaxy population at large @xcite .",
    "our suggestion though is based on fairly restrictive assumptions about the star formation histories of these galaxies [ exponentially - declining , starting @xmath208 gyr ago ] ; more robust results on age and metallicity variations along the rs in virgo s core from a joint uv - optical - nir analysis will be the subject of future work .",
    "a flattening at the bright end of the rs for virgo etgs was first identified by @xcite and later confirmed in several colors by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter jl09 ) .",
    "this seems to be a ubiquitous feature of the quiescent galaxy population , based on cmd analyses for nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "this flattening may also be present in our data , beginning at @xmath1 19 , but the small number of bright galaxies in the core makes it difficult to tell .",
    "also , this feature does not appear in colors involving the band , but this could be explained by a plausible error in this measurement for m87 [  0.1 mag ] , the brightest galaxy in our sample .",
    "the flattening seen at bright magnitudes implies that the rs is non - linear .",
    "a key insight revealed by the lowess fits in is that the linearity of the rs also breaks down at faint magnitudes , in all colors .",
    "the sense of this non - linearity is that , for @xmath28 14 , the local slope is shallower than at brighter magnitudes , even flat in some cases [  u ; see appendix ] . for several colors [  i ] , the lowess fits suggest that the behavior at the faint end of the rs may be even more complex , but the scale of such variations is well below the photometric errors [ see ] .",
    "jl09 found that the color - magnitude relation [ cmr ] of etgs also changes slope in a similar manner , but at a brighter magnitude than us [ @xmath1 16.5 ] ; we address this discrepancy in .",
    "an implication of the faint - end flattening of the rs is that the low - mass dwarfs in virgo s core tend to be more alike in color than galaxies of higher mass .",
    "this raises the question of whether the scatter at the faint - end of the rs reflects intrinsic color variations or just observational errors .",
    "we address this issue in by comparing the observed scatter in the _ total _ colors to error estimates based on the artificial galaxies mentioned in .",
    "shown there are lowess fits to the data and the scatter about them [ solid and dashed lines , respectively ] , and the scatter expected from photometric errors [ dotted lines ] . both types of scatter have been averaged within three bins of magnitude : 15 @xmath29 @xmath3 13 , 13 @xmath29 @xmath3 11 , and 11",
    "@xmath29 @xmath3 9 ; the comparison does not probe higher luminosities because our artificial galaxy catalog was limited to  @xmath8 16 , by design .",
    "we generally find that the scatter and errors both increase towards faint magnitudes and that the two quantities match well , except in the brightest bin , where the scatter mildly exceeds the errors .",
    "for the other bins however , the intrinsic scatter must be small , strengthening the assertion that the faintest galaxies possess uniform colors [ to within @xmath260.05 mag ] and , possibly , stellar populations .",
    "deeper imaging will be needed to improve the constraints on genuine color variations at these luminosities .",
    "the last topic examined in this section is the effect of aperture size on galaxy color .",
    "our most important result , the flattening of the rs at faint magnitudes , is based on galaxy colors integrated within their half - light radii . aperture effects could be significant in the presence of radial color gradients , as suggested by @xcite , and therefore bias our inferences on the shape of the rs .",
    "in we show lowess fits to the u  and   rss for colors measured within 0.5 , 1.0 , 2.0 , and 3.0 .",
    "these particular colors are chosen because , in the absence of deep uv and nir photometry , they provide the only leverage on stellar populations for the _ full _ ngvs dataset .",
    "we also include measurements of the scatter about these fits for the 0.5  and 3.0  apertures , represented by the shaded envelopes .",
    "16 mag for ( u ) , with smaller apertures yielding steeper slopes , while the rs is more stable in (  ) .",
    "the shaded envelopes represent the scatter about the rs for the 0.5  and 3.0  apertures.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the top panel of shows that u  changes by at most 0.04 - 0.06 mag at @xmath3 17 between consecutive aperture pairs .",
    "two - sample @xmath30tests of linear fits to the data indicate that these differences are significant at the @xmath31 = 0.01 level .",
    "conversely , hardly any variation is seen between apertures for galaxies with > 16 .",
    "the bottom panel of demonstrates that   changes little with radius in most of our galaxies .",
    "slight exceptions are the 0.5  colors for galaxies with @xmath3 16 , which differ from the 2.0 and 3.0  colors by @xmath260.04 mag .",
    "the 1.0  colors bridge this gap , following the 0.5  sequence at @xmath28 17 and moving towards the other sequences for brighter magnitudes .",
    "the changes in the rs with galactocentric radius imply the existence of _ negative _ color gradients within specific regions of select galaxies .",
    "the strongest gradients are found for u  within bright galaxies , inside 2.0 , while galaxies with @xmath8 15 have little - to - none in either color .",
    "mild negative gradients are seen in   between 0.5 and 1.0  for galaxies with @xmath29 17 , consistent with previous work on the spatially - resolved colors of galaxies throughout virgo @xcite .",
    "the most important insight though from is that the flattening of the rs at faint magnitudes does not apply to a specific aperture .",
    "the implications of those gradients we do detect in our galaxies , in terms of stellar populations and comparisons with galaxy formation models , will be addressed in .",
    "before discussing the implications of our results , over the next two sections we compare our rs to earlier / ongoing work on the colors of virgo galaxies and css , starting with the former .",
    "of the several studies of the galaxy cmd in virgo @xcite , that of jl09 is the most appropriate for our purposes .",
    "jl09 measured colors for 468 etgs from the virgo cluster catalog @xcite , based on @xmath32 imaging from sdss dr5 @xcite .",
    "their sample is spread throughout the cluster and has @xmath33 18.0 .",
    "most interestingly , they showed that these galaxies trace a non - linear relation in all optical cmds , not unlike what we find for faint members inhabiting the centralmost regions .     to that measured here [ red dots ] .",
    "the full sample is plotted for each dataset and lowess fits for both are overlaid [ solid lines ] .",
    "representative errors for the ngvs are included along the bottom .",
    "( _ bottom _ ) as above but restricted to the galaxies common to both samples ; measurement pairs are joined with lines .",
    "the ngvs extends the cmd for this cluster faintward by @xmath15 mag , with much improved photometric errors .",
    "we also find that jl09 s cmr is steeper than our own at intermediate magnitudes , likely due to their inclusion of systems having recent star formation and possible errors in their sky subtraction.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    in we overlay the u  cmd from jl09 against our own , measured within 1.0 ; the comparison is appropriate since jl09 measured colors within their galaxies @xmath34band half - light radii .",
    "we have transformed jl09 s photometry to the cfht / megacam system following equation 4 in @xcite .",
    "the top panel shows all objects from both samples , along with respective lowess fits , while the bottom is restricted to the 62 galaxies in common to both .",
    "we focus on the u  color because of its importance to stellar population analyses ; indeed , this is a reason why accurate u  band photometry was a high priority for the ngvs .",
    "the most notable feature in the top panel of is the superior depth of the ngvs relative to the sdss , an extension of @xmath15 mag .",
    "there is a clear difference in scatter between the two samples , with that for jl09 increasing rapidly for @xmath8 18 , whereas the increase for the ngvs occurs much more gradually [ _ cf_. ; see fig . 1 of @xcite as well ] .",
    "furthermore , the jl09 cmr has a lower zeropoint [ by @xmath10.06 ] and a shallower slope than the ngvs rs for @xmath26 19 , which two - sample @xmath30tests verify as significant [ @xmath31 = 0.01 ] .",
    "the jl09 data also exhibit a flattening of the cmr in the dwarf regime , but at a brighter magnitude than that seen in ours [ @xmath1 16.5 ] .",
    "the shallower slopes found by jl09 at both ends of their cmr are seen for other colors and so can not be explained by limitations / biases in the sdss @xmath35band imaging .",
    "the shallower slope at bright magnitudes substantiates what was hinted at in and is more obvious in jl09 since their sample covers the full cluster ; the existence of this feature is also well - known from sdss studies of the wider galaxy population @xcite .",
    "the lower zeropoint of the jl09 cmr is seen in other colors too , hinting that calibration differences between sdss dr5 and dr7 are responsible , where the ngvs is anchored to the latter @xcite .",
    "lastly , the lowess fits in indicate that , between 19 @xmath26 @xmath26 16.5 , the jl09 cmr has a steeper slope than the ngvs rs .",
    "this difference is significant [ @xmath31 = 0.01 ] and holds for other u  band colors as well .",
    "this steeper slope forms part of jl09 s claim that the etg cmr flattens at @xmath28 16.5 , a feature not seen in our data .",
    "since jl09 selected their sample based on morphology , recent star formation in dwarf galaxies could help create their steeper slope .",
    "for one , the colors of many galaxies in the jl09 sample overlap with those flagged in our sample as star - forming . also , @xcite find that ds0s in virgo follow a steeper uv cmr than des and have bluer uv - optical colors at a given magnitude .",
    "we therefore are unsurprised to have not observed the flattening detected by jl09 .",
    "recent star formation can not solely explain why jl09 find a steeper slope at intermediate magnitudes though .",
    "the bottom panel of shows that , for the same galaxies , jl09 measure systematically bluer u  colors ; moreover , this difference grows to fainter magnitudes , creating a steeper cmr .",
    "comparisons of other colors [   ] and the agreement found therein proves that this issue only concerns jl09",
    "s @xmath35band magnitudes .",
    "the stated trend in the color discrepancy appears inconsistent with possible errors in our sdss - megacam transformations .",
    "aperture effects can also be ruled out since the differences in size scatter about zero and never exceed 25% for any one object ; besides , demonstrates that color gradients in u  are minimal at faint magnitudes .",
    "a possible culprit may be under - subtracted backgrounds in jl09 s @xmath35band images since they performed their own sky subtraction .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the differences between the jl09 cmr and ngvs rs for @xmath8 19 can be explained by : ( i ) a drop in the red fraction amongst virgo etgs between 19 @xmath26 @xmath26 16.5 , and ( ii ) jl09 s measurement of systematically brighter @xmath35band magnitudes . despite this disagreement ,",
    "these comparisons highlight two exciting aspects about the ngvs rs [ and the photometry overall ] : ( i ) it extends several magnitudes deeper than the sdss , and ( ii ) the photometric errors are well - controlled up to the survey limits .",
    "[ cols=\"^ \" , ]     the ngvs is unique in that it provides photometry for complete samples of stellar systems within a single global environment , including galaxies , gcs , galactic nuclei , and ucds .",
    "these systems are often compared to one another through their relative luminosities and sizes @xcite , whereas their relative stellar contents , _ based on homogeneous datasets _ , are poorly known .",
    "given the depth of the ngvs rs , we have a unique opportunity to begin filling this gap by examining the colors of faint dwarfs and css at fixed lumuniosity .",
    "our samples of gcs , nuclei , and ucds are drawn from the catalogs of peng  ( in preparation ) , f16 , and @xcite , respectively ; complete details on the selection functions for these samples may be found in those papers .",
    "briefly though , gcs and ucds were both identified via magnitude cuts and the @xmath36 diagram @xcite , and separated from each other through size constraints [ @xmath37 11 pc for ucds ] .",
    "the validity of candidate gcs are assessed probabilistically and we use only those having a probability @xmath8 50% .",
    "all ucds in the @xcite catalog are spectroscopically - confirmed cluster members .",
    "lastly , galactic nuclei were identified by visual inspection of the image cutouts for each galaxy and modelled in the 1d surface brightness profiles with srsic functions . for our purposes ,",
    "we only consider those objects classified as unambiguous or possible nuclei in the f16 catalog .    in",
    "we plot the cmds of galaxies and css in virgo s core [ left - hand side ] and the color distributions for objects with  @xmath8 18 [ right - hand side ] ; u  colors are shown in the upper row and i  in the lower . note that we have truncated the css samples to 18 @xmath29  @xmath29 22 so that our comparisons focus on a common luminosity range .",
    "an obvious difference between the distributions for galaxies and css at faint luminosities is the latter s extension to very red colors , whereas the former is consistent with a single color [ ] . this is interesting given that css have a higher surface density than the faint dwarfs in virgo s core , suggesting that , at fixed luminosity , diffuse systems are forced to be blue while concentrated systems can have a wide range of colors .",
    "the nature of red css is likely explained by a higher metal content , since metallicity more strongly affects the colors of quiescent systems than age [ see ] .",
    "also , the spearman rank test suggests that nuclei follow cmrs in both u  [ @xmath38 = 0.57 ; @xmath39 = 4 @xmath40 10@xmath41 and i  [ @xmath38 @xmath1 0.5 ; @xmath39 = 6 @xmath40 10@xmath42 , hinting at a possible mass - metallicity relation for this population .",
    "a contribution of density to the colors of css is not obvious though given that many [ if not most ] of them were produced in the vicinity of higher - mass galaxies , and so may owe their enrichment to their local environments .",
    "the as - yet uncertain nature of ucds as either the massive tail of the gc population or the bare nuclei of stripped galaxies also raises ambiguity on what governs their stellar contents , be it due to internal or external factors [ self - enrichment versus enriched natal gas clouds ] .    while it is possible for css to be quite red for their luminosities , the majority of them have bluer colors , in both u  and i , that agree better with those of faint rs galaxies .",
    "closer inspection of the right - half of reveals some tensions between the populations though .",
    "ks tests indicate that the null hypothesis of a common parent distribution for galaxies and gcs is strongly disfavored for u  and i  [ @xmath43 , whereas conclusions vary for ucds and nuclei depending on the color under consideration [ @xmath44 0.09 and @xmath45 for ucds ; @xmath44 0.007 and @xmath46 0.07 for nuclei ] .",
    "the tails in the distributions for the css play an important role in these tests , but their removal only brings about consistency for the nuclei . for instance , clipping objects with u@xmath20 1.2 increases the associated @xmath39values to 0.18 , 0.17 , and 0.04 for ucds , nuclei , and gcs , respectively , while @xmath39 changes to @xmath47 , 0.65 , and @xmath48 by removing objects with i  @xmath20 0.85 .",
    "we have also fit skewed normal distributions to each dataset , finding consistent mean values between galaxies and css [ except gcs , which have a larger value in i ] , while the standard deviations for galaxies is typically larger than those for css .",
    "the evidence for common spectral shapes between the majority of css and faint galaxies in the core of virgo is therefore conflicting .",

    "we explore whether current galaxy formation models plausibly explain these subjects by reproducing the rs in the core of virgo .",

    "h15 significantly revised the l - galaxies sam , centered on : ( i ) increased efficiency of radio - mode agn feedback ; ( ii ) delayed reincoporation of galactic winds [ scaling inversely with halo mass ] ; ( iii ) reduced density threshold for star formation ; ( iv ) agn heating within satellites ; and ( v ) no ram pressure stripping of hot halo gas in low - mass groups .",

    "we selected galaxies from the = 0.0 snapshot of h15 that inhabit massive halos [ @xmath54 m@xmath55 , have non - zero stellar masses , are quenched [ @xmath56 yr@xmath57 and bulge - dominated [ @xmath58 0.5 , by mass ] ; the last constraint aims to weed out highly - reddened spirals .",
    "we query the catalogs for both the millenium i and ii simulations , where the latter fills in the low - mass end of the galaxy mass function , making this sample of model galaxies the best match to the luminosity / mass range of our dataset .",
    "similar selection criteria were used to obtain our samples of illustris and eagle galaxies , except that involving @xmath59 since bulge parameters are not included with either simulation s catalogs .",

    "broadband magnitudes in the sdss filters were obtained from all three models and transformed to the cfht / megacam system [ see ] .",
    "we note that these magnitudes and the associated colors correspond to the _ total _ light of these galaxies .",
    "a final note about this comparison is that we stack clusters from each model before analysing its rs .",
    "the high densities of cluster cores make them difficult to resolve within cosmological volumes , particularly for hydro simulations , leading to small samples for individual clusters .",
    "stacking is therefore needed to enable a meaningful analysis of the model cmd for quenched cluster - core galaxies .",
    "h15 , illustris , and eagle respectively yield @xmath115k , 144 , and 157 galaxies lying within 300 kpc of their host halos centers , which is roughly equivalent to the projected size of virgo s core [ as we define it ] .",
    "note that the much larger size of the h15 sample is explained by the greater spatial volume it models and the fainter luminosities reached by sams [ @xmath3 12 , compared to @xmath26 15 for hydro models ] .",

    "band colors since their catalogs lack sdss @xmath35band magnitudes .",
    "the clear impression from is that no model reproduces the rs in virgo s core , with model slopes being uniformly shallower than observed .",
    "two - sample @xmath30tests of linear fits to the data and models show that these differences are significant at the @xmath31 = 0.01 level , except for the case of the eagle models and color [ @xmath31 = 0.09 ] .",
    "further , the h15 rs exhibits no sign of the flattening we observe at faint magnitudes ; the hydro models unfortunately lack the dynamic range needed to evaluate them in this regard .",
    "the model rss also differ from one another to varying degrees .",
    "first , h15 favors a shallower slope than the hydro models .",
    "second , the color of the h15 rs monotonically reddens towards bright magnitudes whereas the hydro rss turnover sharply at @xmath26 19 .",
    "eagle and illustris agree well except for the ubiquitos upturn at faint magnitudes in the latter s rs [ marked with dashed lines ] .",
    "these upturns are created by the resolution criterion we impose on the illustris catalog and should be disregarded .",
    "underlying this behavior is the fact that lines of constant trace out an approximate anti - correlation in color - magnitude space @xcite , a pattern clearly seen when working with richer samples from this model [  galaxies from _ all _ cluster - centric radii ] .",
    "third , the scatter in h15 is typically the smallest and approximately constant with magnitude , whereas those of the hydro models are larger and increase towards faint magnitudes , more so for illustris . given that we find little intrinsic scatter in the ngvs rs at @xmath8 15 [ ] , h15 appears to outperform the hydro models in this regard , although we can only trace the latter s scatter to @xmath1 15 .",
    "other differences between illustris and eagle appear for the colors i , i , and i , in terms of turnovers , slopes and/or zeropoints , all of which are significant [ @xmath31 = 0.01 ] .",
    "it is worth noting that while references colors measured within 1.0  for ngvs galaxies [ to maximize their numbers ] , the agreement is not much improved if we use colors from larger apertures .",
    "the conflicting shapes on the rs from data and models could be viewed in one of two ways : ( i ) the core of virgo is somehow special , or ( ii ) models fail to reproduce the evolution of cluster - core galaxies . to help demonstrate that the latter is more probable , we compare the same models against a separate dataset for nearby clusters .",
    "wings @xcite is an all - sky survey of a complete , x  ray selected sample of 77 galaxy clusters spread over a narrow redshift range [ = 0.04  0.07 ] . @xcite measured the slope of the rs for 72 wings clusters using @xmath62 photometry for galaxies in the range 21.5 @xmath63 18 .",

    "each model distribution is shown for the two closest snapshots to the redshift limits of the wings sample . in the case of h15 and illustris , these snapshots bracket the wings range quite well , whereas the redshift sampling of eagle is notably coarser . the latter fact may be important to explaining the difference between the two distributions for this model , since = 0.1 corresponds to a look - back time of @xmath11.3 gyr . on the other hand , h15 and illustris suggest that the rs slope does not evolve between = 0.07/0.08 and 0.03 .",
    "we have not tried to link model clusters across redshifts as parsing merger trees lies beyond the scope of this work .",
    "observations though support the idea of a static slope in clusters over the range = 0  1 @xcite .",
    "demonstrates that the distributions for the wings and model clusters are clearly incompatible , with the models , on average , preferring a shallower slope for the rs .",
    "the sense of this discrepancy is the same as that seen in between the core of virgo and the models .",
    "a caveat with the comparisons to wings though is that the model slopes have all been measured in the respective rest - frames of the clusters . in other words ,",
    "the model slopes could be biased by differential redshifting of galaxy colors as a function of magnitude [  fainter galaxies reddened more than brighter ones ] . to address this",
    ", we have simulated the effect of @xmath66corrections using the median of the eagle distribution at = 0.1 , finding it would steepen this cluster s rs by 0.01 .",
    "while significant , we recall that the redshift range for the wings sample is = 0.04  0.07 , such that the mean @xmath66correction to the model slopes is likely smaller than this value and would therefore not bring about better agreement .    given the value of the above comparisons for testing galaxy formation models , we provide in the appendix parametric fits to the ngvs rs in every color [ measured at 1 ] .",
    "these fits reproduce our lowess curves well and enable the wider community to perform their own comparisons .",
    "indicates that @xmath890% of the galaxy population within the innermost @xmath1300 kpc of the virgo cluster has likely been quenched of star formation .",
    "this makes the population ideal for studying the characteristics of the rs , such as its shape and intrinsic scatter .",
    "our analysis demonstrates that , in all optical colors , the rs is ( a ) non - linear and ( b ) strongly flattens in the domain of faint dwarfs .",
    "the former behavior had already been uncovered in virgo , albeit at the bright end ( @xcite ; jl09 ) , while the latter , which is new , begins at 14 @xmath29 @xmath29 13 [ see appendix ] , well above the completeness limit of the ngvs .",
    "no correlation is observed between color and surface brightness , in bins of luminosity , for @xmath8 15 , implying that the faint - end flattening is not the result of bias or selection effect .",
    "the rs follows the same general shape at @xmath29 14 in each color , which may have implications for trends in the stellar populations of these galaxies . assuming that bluer [  u ] and redder [   ] colors preferentially trace mean age and metallicity @xcite , respectively , the decrease in color towards faint magnitudes over the range 19",
    "@xmath26 @xmath3 14 hints that the populations become younger and less enriched ( consistent with downsizing ; @xcite ) , with two exceptions .",
    "the flattening at bright magnitudes , seen better in samples that span the full cluster ( jl09 ) and the global galaxy population @xcite , signals either a recent burst of star formation within these galaxies or an upper limit to galactic chemical enrichment .",
    "the latter seems more likely given that the stellar mass - metallicity relation for galaxies plateaus at @xmath28 10@xmath67  @xcite .",
    "the other exception concerns the flattening at the faint - end of the rs .",
    "if colors reasonably trace stellar population parameters [ see next sub - section ] , then arguably the most exciting interpretation suggested by the data is that the faint dwarfs in virgo s core have a near - uniform age and metallicity , over a range of @xmath134 magnitudes .",
    "this would imply that the known stellar population scaling relations for quiescent galaxies of intermediate - to - high mass @xcite break down at low masses [ below @xmath14 @xmath40 10@xmath68 ; see appendix ] and , more fundamentally , that the physics governing the star formation histories and chemical enrichment of galaxies decouples from mass at these scales .",
    "given the nature of our sample , the above scenario begs the questions of whether the faint - end flattening of the rs is caused by the environment , and if so , when and where the quenching occurs .",
    "while @xcite make the case that dwarfs with @xmath29 10@xmath69  must essentially be satellites in order to quench ( also see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , we know little of the efficiency and timescale of quenching at low satellite masses and as a function of host halo mass .",
    "using illustris , @xcite showed that , on average , the time to quench in low - mass clusters decreases towards low satellite masses , from @xmath15.5 gyr to @xmath13 gyr , over the range 8.5 @xmath26 log @xmath26 10 .",
    "@xcite combine measurements of local group dwarfs with @xmath51-body simulations to suggest that , in such groups , galaxies of @xmath26 10@xmath68  quench within 1 - 2 gyr of their first pericenter passage .",
    "however , @xcite compared hst / wfpc2 star formation histories to predicted infall times based on via lactea ii @xcite , finding that many dwarfs in the local group likely quenched prior to infall .",
    "in addition to reionization , pre - processing within smaller host halos may play a key role in explaining why many local group dwarfs ceased forming stars before their accretion .",
    "likewise , pre - processing must also be considered when trying to understand issues pertaining to quenching of cluster galaxies @xcite , such as the cause of virgo s flattened rs at faint magnitudes . @xcite",
    "deduced where satellites of = 0 groups / clusters were when they quenched their star formation , by modelling sdss observations of quiescent fractions with mock catalogs .",
    "they found that for host halo masses of 10@xmath70  the fraction of satellites that quenched via pre - processing increases towards lower satellite masses , down to their completeness limit of @xmath1 7 @xmath40 10@xmath69 , largely at the expense of quenching in - situ .",
    "extrapolating this trend to lower satellite masses suggests that the majority of the quiescent , low - mass dwarfs in virgo were quenched elsewhere .",
    "this suggestion is consistent with abundance matching results for our sample @xcite , which indicate that only half of the core galaxies with = 10@xmath71  were accreted by @xmath1 1 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .     versus those predicted by the fsps stellar population model [ colored lines ] , constrained by the @xcite mass - metallicity relation [ top panel ] .",
    "each model relation corresponds to a certain fixed age , ranging between @xmath12 gyr [ purple ] and @xmath115 gyr [ red ] in steps of 0.025 dex .",
    "error bars on the ngvs relations represent standard errors in the mean within bins of luminosity.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    assuming that the flattening of the rs reflects an approximate homogeneity in stellar contents [ constant mean age ] and isolated low - mass dwarfs have constant star formation histories @xcite , then the low - mass dwarfs in virgo s core must have quenched their star formation coevally .",
    "moreover , when coupled with a significant contribution by pre - processing , it is implied that these galaxies are highly susceptible to environmental forces , over a range of host masses .",
    "this seems plausible given the very high quiescent fractions [ @xmath880% ] for satellites between 10@xmath10 @xmath29 @xmath72/  @xmath29 10@xmath73 within the local volume @xcite , which has led to the idea of a threshold satellite mass for effective environmental quenching @xcite .",
    "if synchronized quenching of low - mass dwarfs in groups [ at least to @xmath110@xmath74 ] leads to a flattened faint - end slope of the core rs , we should expect to find the same feature for dwarfs drawn from larger cluster - centric radii .",
    "this follows from the fact that a satellite s cluster - centric radius correlates with its infall time @xcite and that the fraction of satellites accreted via groups increases towards low redshift @xcite .",
    "studying the properties of the rs as a function of cluster - centric position (  see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will be the focus of a future paper in the ngvs series .",
    "a major caveat with the above interpretations is that optical colors are not unambiguous tracers of population parameters , especially at low metallicities @xcite . to this point , @xcite have shown that stellar metallicity increases monotonically for galaxies from [ fe / h ] @xmath1 2.3 at = 10@xmath60  to slightly super - solar at = 10@xmath74 . assuming this trend holds in all environments",
    ", we can check for any conditions under which the rs would flatten at faint magnitudes . in the middle and bottom panels of we compare the u  and   color - mass relations in virgo s core [ black lines ] to those predicted by the flexible stellar population synthesis [ fsps ] model @xcite , where the kirby  relation [ top panel ] is used to assign masses to each model metallicity track and lines of constant age are colored from purple [ @xmath12 gyr ] to red [ @xmath115 gyr ] .",
    "other models @xcite prove inadequate for our needs due to their coarse sampling of metallicity space over the range @xmath75 @xmath76 to @xmath77 .",
    "error bars on the ngvs relations reflect standard errors in the mean , measured within seven bins of luminosity [ having sizes of 0.5 - 2.0 dex ] .",
    "although we assume single - burst star formation histories for this test , qualitatively similar trends are expected for more complex treatments (  constant star formation with variable quenching epochs ; @xcite ) .",
    "since the intent of is to explore an alternative interpretation of the faint - end flattening of the rs , we limit our discussion to the range @xmath78 , but show the full relations for completeness . within that range , we find that the data are indeed consistent with kirby s mass - metallicity relation , provided that age does not vary greatly therein . moreover , the color - mass relation for select ages transitions to a flatter slope at lower masses .",
    "this confirms our previous statement that it is difficult to meaningfully constrain metallicities below a certain level with _",
    "optical _ colors [ @xmath79 in the case of fsps ] , even when ages are independently known .",
    "the inconsistent ages we would infer from the the u  and   colors could likely be ameliorated by lowering the zeropoint of the kirby  relation since the former color responds more strongly to metallicity for log(@xmath80 1 .",
    "the comparisons shown in therefore cast doubt on whether the flattening of the rs at faint magnitudes implies both a constant age _ and _ metallicity for cluster galaxies at low masses . distinguishing between these scenarios will be more rigorously addressed in forthcoming work on the stellar populations of ngvs galaxies that incorporates uv and nir photometry as well .",
    "regardless of the uncertainties inherent to the interpretation of optical colors , we should expect galaxy formation models to reproduce our observations if their physical recipes are correct .",
    "our test of such models is special in that it focuses on the core of a = 0 galaxy cluster , where the time - integrated effect of environment on galaxy evolution should be maximal .",
    "however , shows that current models produce a shallower rs than observed , in all colors .",
    "this issue is not limited to virgo s core , as demonstrates that the distributions of rs slopes for _ entire _ model clusters populate shallower values than those measured for other nearby clusters . on a related note , @xcite",
    "have shown that clusters at @xmath29 1 in sams suffer from etg populations with too low an abundance and too blue colors , while @xmath110% of model clusters have positive rs slopes .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite found broad consistency between observations and sams in the zeropoint and slope of the rs in @xmath8 1 clusters .",
    "this suggests that errors creep into the evolution of cluster galaxies in sams at @xmath29 1 .",
    "the discrepancies indicated here follow upon similar issues highlighted by modellers themselves .",
    "h15 showed that their model produces a rs having bluer colors than observed in the sdss for galaxies with @xmath81 .",
    "@xcite found the illustris rs suffers the same problem , albeit at higher masses [ @xmath82 ] , while also producing too low of a red fraction at @xmath83 . @xcite analyzed the colors of eagle galaxies , finding that its rs matches that from the gama survey @xcite for @xmath84 20.5 , but is too red at fainter magnitudes .",
    "our comparisons build on this work by drawing attention to model treatments of dense environments over cosmic time and [ hopefully ] incentivize modellers to employ our dataset in future work , especially as they extend their focus towards lower galaxy masses . to this end",
    ", the reader is reminded of the parametric fits to the ngvs rs provided in the appendix .",
    "naturally , the root of the above discrepancies is tied to errors in the stellar populations of model galaxies .",
    "the supplementary material of h15 shows that the model _ exceeds _ the mean stellar metallicity of galaxies over the range @xmath85 @xmath86  by several tenths of a dex while _ undershooting _ measurements at @xmath87 @xmath88  by @xmath10.10.2 dex",
    ". the issues with the h15 rs then seems to reflect shortcomings in _ both _ the star formation and chemical enrichment histories of their model galaxies .",
    "part of the disagreement facing illustris likely stems from the fact that their galaxies have older stellar populations than observed , by as much as 4 gyr , for @xmath89  @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that eagle produces a flatter stellar mass - metallicity relation than measured from local galaxies due to too much enrichment at @xmath86 .",
    "our inspection of the stellar populations in h15 and eagle reveals that their cluster - core galaxies , on average , have roughly a constant mass - weighted age [ @xmath110 - 11 gyr ] and follow a shallow mass - metallicity relation , with eagle metallicities exceeding h15 values by @xmath10.3 dex .",
    "the discrepant colors produced by models thus reflect errors in both the star formation histories and chemical enrichment of cluster galaxies ; for instance , ram pressure stripping may be _ too _ effective in quenching cluster dwarfs of star formation @xcite .",
    "two critical aspects of the rs that modellers must aim to reproduce are the flattenings at both bright and faint magnitudes .",
    "the former is already a contentious point between models themselves , with hydro varieties producing a turnover and while sams continuously increase [ ] .",
    "we remind the reader that our lowess curves are too steep for @xmath26 19 since they essentially represent an extrapolation from intermediate magnitudes ; the bright - end flattening is clearly visible in other datasets that span the full cluster and contain more of such galaxies [ ] .",
    "hydro models appear to supercede sams in this regard , although it may be argued that their turnovers are too sharp . in the case of eagle , however , it is unclear what causes this turnover as several of their brightest cluster galaxies are star - forming at = 0 while their luminosity - metallicity relation inverts for @xmath3 20 .    at present",
    ", only sams have the requisite depth to check for the flattening seen at the faint end of the rs ; the effective resolution of cosmological hydro models is too low to probe the luminosity function to @xmath1 13 . shows that the h15 rs exhibits no obvious change in slope at faint magnitudes , let alone the pronounced flattening seen in virgo .",
    "the faint - end flattening is a tantalizing feature of the rs that may hold new physical insights into the evolution of cluster galaxies of low mass .",
    "addressing the absence of these features should be a focal point for future refinements of galaxy formation models .",
    "we have used homogeneous isophotal photometry in the ui  bands for 404 galaxies belonging to the innermost @xmath1300 kpc of the virgo cluster to study the cmd in a dense environment at = 0 , down to stellar masses of @xmath90 .",
    "our main results are :    * the majority of galaxies in virgo s core populate the rs [ red fraction @xmath1 0.9 ] ; * the rs has a non - zero slope at intermediate magnitudes [ 19 @xmath29 @xmath29 14 ] in all colors , suggesting that stellar age and metallicity both decrease towards lower galaxy masses , and has minimal intrinsic scatter at the faint end ; * the rs flattens at both the brightest and faintest magnitudes [ @xmath29 19 and @xmath8 14 , respectively ] , where the latter has not been seen before ; * galaxy formation models produce a shallower rs than observed at intermediate magnitudes , for both virgo and other nearby clusters .",

    "the flattening of the rs at faint magnitudes raises intriguing possibilities regarding galaxy evolution and/or cluster formation .",

    "this can be done with the parameter @xmath95 and shows that 14 @xmath101 13 , in a large majority of cases . for   and i  the transition magnitude is brighter than 14 , which might be explained by the fact that these colors sample short wavelength baselines and that the rs spans small ranges therein [ @xmath10.25 and 0.15 mag , respectively ] .",
    "it is also likely that the posterior distributions for the parameters in our fit are correlated .",
    "another way to assess the magnitude at which the rs flattens involves measuring the local gradient along our lowess fits , the advantage being that this approach is non - parametric . shows our rss [ top panel ] , scaled to a common zeropoint [ arbitrarily established at @xmath1 14 ] , and the variation of the local gradient as a function of magnitude [ bottom panel ] .",
    "we measure the local gradient using a running bin of 9 [ thin line ] or 51 [ thick line ] data points , with the smaller bin allowing us to extend our measurements to brighter magnitudes , where our sample is sparse .",
    "the local gradient varies in a consistent way for all colors at @xmath3 12 : the gradient is roughly constant and negative at bright magnitudes and becomes more positive towards faint magnitudes .",
    "the behaviors of the gradients at @xmath8 12 are more irregular as small fluctuations in the lowess curves are amplified when the gradients hover near zero .",
    "these behaviors are beyond this discussion however ; we are interested in the locations where the rate of change of the gradients is maximized [ i.e. the second derivatives of the rss peak ] . disregarding the curves at @xmath8 12 then , the bottom panel of shows that the rate of change maximizes in the range 14",

    "the approximate synchronicity of the flattening of the rs adds further insight to our main result on the flattening of the rs by suggesting a mass scale below which internal processes may cease to govern the stellar populations and evolution of dwarf satellites .",

    "<S> the sensitivity of the ngvs imaging allows us to continuously probe galaxy colors over a factor of @xmath0 in luminosity , from brightest cluster galaxies to scales overlapping classical satellites of the milky way [ @xmath1 9 ; @xmath2 ] , within a single environment . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , we find the first evidence that the rs flattens in all colors at the faint - magnitude end [ starting between 14 @xmath3 @xmath3 13 , around @xmath4 ] , with the slope decreasing to @xmath160% or less of its value at brighter magnitudes </S>",
    "<S> . this could indicate that the stellar populations of faint dwarfs in virgo s core share similar characteristics [  constant mean age ] over @xmath13 mags in luminosity , suggesting that these galaxies were quenched coevally , likely via pre - processing in smaller hosts . </S>",
    "<S> we also compare our results to galaxy formation models , finding that the rs in model clusters have slopes at intermediate magnitudes that are too shallow , and in the case of semi - analytic models , do not reproduce the flattening seen at both extremes [ bright / faint ] of the virgo rs . </S>",
    "<S> deficiencies in the chemical evolution of model galaxies likely contribute to the model - data discrepancies at all masses , while overly efficient quenching may also be a factor at dwarf scales . </S>",
    "<S> deep uv and near - ir photometry are required to unambiguously diagnose the cause of the faint - end flattening . </S>"
