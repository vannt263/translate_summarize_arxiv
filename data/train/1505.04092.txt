    "the fitted band onsets , @xmath95 mev on clean au(111 ) and @xmath96 mev on graphene covered au(111 ) , are higher than on the au(111 ) surface of a single crystal , which is probably due to confinement effects of the thin au(111 ) layer on the ir(111 ) and charge transfer from the graphene , respectively .",

    "however , this edge state is suppressed on ir(111 ) as will be explained in the following .",
    "+ dft calculations of a graphene ribbon on top of ir(111 ) show that the strong interaction between the ir d@xmath2-orbitals and the p@xmath1 orbitals of graphene lead to a preferential on - top position of the c - atoms at the edge with respect to ir atoms ( see relaxed geometry in fig .",
    "[ fig8](a ) , left area ) .",
    "the bond induced downwards bending of the c atoms by about 1.6 @xmath85 leads to a sp@xmath101 like bonding configuration of the c atom with two bonds to neighboring c s and one bond to the neighboring ir d@xmath2 orbital .",
    "the remaining sp@xmath101 bond is most likely saturated by hydrogen which originates from the preparation via c@xmath5h@xmath7 .",
    "the latter has been verified by comparison between measured stm images at different bias and simulated stm images based on dft @xcite . moreover , the single - h terminated c - atoms at the edge are energetically favorable with respect to double - hydrogenated c - atoms and unsaturated c atoms on top of ir(111 ) @xcite .",
    "importantly , the preferential on - top position of the c - atoms causes strain within the graphene edge region due to an effective lattice mismatch between graphene and ir(111 ) of about 10 % .",
    "this , in turn , causes strain relaxation areas , where the graphene edge is more detached from the ir(111 ) being close to its natural distance in the interior of extended graphene of @xmath102 @xmath85 @xcite ( see right area of fig . [ fig8](a ) ) .",
    "these more detached areas mimic a sp@xmath9 bonding configuration with two bonds connected to neighboring c atoms and the remaining one being saturated by h , while the edge p@xmath1 orbital remains unsaturated .",
    "+ surprisingly , the dft calculations did not find indications of the predicted edge state being a hallmark of the zigzag edge .",

    "this result is found for several tens of graphene qds using a similar number of different microtips .",
    "+ the absence of the edge state is surprising , since it is generally believed that the edge is a relatively robust feature of graphene zigzag edges .",
    "it originates from the fact that the introduction of radical @xmath105-bonds on every third edge atom allows the formation of clar s sextets ( six double bonds in one benzoid ring ) through the whole interior of the graphene bulk , such that substantial kinetic energy by the corresponding delocalization of electrons within the p@xmath1 orbitals of the ring can be gained @xcite .",
    "the radicals at the edge then form the flat band at @xmath4 being prone to a ferromagnetic instability , if @xmath106 @xcite .",
    "thus , at first hand , the soft confinement found in the previous paragraph for graphene qds on ir(111 ) would just move the necessity of these radicals to the interior of the graphene and , thus , would lead to an edge state away from the physical edge of the graphene qd .",
    "such an edge state , however , is also not observed neither in dft nor in sts .",
    "+ there are two possibilities to explain the disappearance of the edge state .",
    "firstly , the bonding along the edge is not translationally invariant on the atomic scale , but resembles a zz(2222222111 ) configuration in the nomenclature by wassmann et al .",
    "@xcite where zz symbolizes the zigzag edge and the numbers describe the number of saturated bonds in the periodically repeated sequence of ten edge atoms .",
    "our dft calculations of a freely suspended graphene ribbon with such an edge termination , represented by h atoms , reveal that this termination , indeed , partly destroys the edge state , i.e. the radicals are only required in the area of the double bonds in order to allow the formation of clar s sextets @xcite .",
    "this can be rationalized by the fact that a zigzag edge length of three unit cells can host clar s sextets in the whole interior of the graphene @xcite . however , for an extended edge , this requires that the surrounding edge areas host ionized p@xmath1 bonds to adapt clar s sextets in the rest of the graphene bulk .",
    "secondly , the presence of the substrate can prefer certain locations of double bonds by the interaction with the d@xmath2 orbital of the ir(111 ) , such that the gain in kinetic energy for clar s sextets is overcompensated by the exchange energy between ir d@xmath2 orbitals and the c p@xmath1 orbitals .",
    "such an effect should be directly visible in stm images which would show these preferred bonds as occupied states close to @xmath3 , while the unfavorable bonds are visible as unoccupied states @xcite .",
    "( d ) stm - image of edge of graphene qd on ir(111 ) with atomic resolution ; ( a ) , ( b ) @xmath107 v , @xmath108 na ; ( c ) , ( d ) @xmath107 v , @xmath108 na ; white lines mark preferential bond orientations within the edge regions of the images . ,",
    "scaledwidth=50.0% ]    indeed , differences between brightly appearing bonds in occupied and empty state stm images ( negative and positive bias , respectively ) are visible in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] . while the bonds perpendicular to the zigzag edge are preferentially empty , other bonds more parallel to the zigzag edge appear to be occupied .",
    "thus , we conclude that the lattice mismatch between ir(111 ) and graphene , leading to the zz(2222222111 ) configuration and to the inequivalence between c - c bonds on the substrate in combination with the d@xmath2 orbital at @xmath3 , leading to a relatively strong interaction with the graphene p@xmath1 orbital , suppresses the edge state on ir(111 ) @xcite .",
    "this is favorable for graphene qds to be used as spin qubits @xcite , since the edge magnetism could interact with the qubit spin , thus , offering a prominent channel for decoherence .",

    "substrate , which exhibits the weakest interaction and only after an additional h - termination of the graphene edges , which further reduces the interaction with the au(111 ) d@xmath2 surface states being located 2 ev below @xmath3 , leaves the charge transfer small enough , such that a ferromagnetic instability occurs according to dft @xcite . in line ,",
    "the published indirect evidence for a ferromagnetic edge state @xcite was observed on au(111 ) , however , without a controlled edge termination .",
    "subsequent hydrogenation of the corresponding graphene nanoribbon edges has also been achieved @xcite , however , so far , without an investigation of the magnetic properties of the edge .",

    "@xcite ( courtesy of p. liljeroth , aalto university ) , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    also in line , the edge state of the graphene qds on ir(111 ) can be recovered by intercalating au(111 ) .",
    "therefore , drost _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , firstly , terminated the graphene zigzag edges by bn , which can be grown on ir(111 ) using borazine ( ( hbnh)@xmath19 ) @xcite and which seamlessly contacts the previously prepared graphene qd edges along the zigzag directions .",
    "secondly , they intercalated au such that the interaction with the substrate is additionally reduced by the removal of the d@xmath2 surface state of ir(111 ) .",
    "figure [ fig10](a ) shows a stm image of the lateral interface between graphene and bn on the au(111 ) showing a state at the interface which slightly varies in perpendicular size probably due to a remaining influence of the substrate .",
    "the corresponding state could be identified by @xmath33 curves ( fig . [ fig10](b ) ) .",
    "it is found to be within @xmath111 mev around @xmath3 in accordance with dft calculations @xcite .",
    "it is not clear so far , if the state is ferromagnetic , which can be probed , e.g. , by spin - polarized stm @xcite .",
    "however , the lateral distribution of the state can be nicely reproduced by dft ignoring the substrate as shown in fig . [ fig10](c ) and ( d ) , if the energetically preferential b - termination of the bn - graphene zigzag interface is chosen @xcite .",
    "+ thus , an edge state can indeed be recovered from the favorable production of zigzag edges on ir(111 ) being located close to @xmath3 .",
    "it might exhibit the long - sought edge magnetism directly",
    ". this would be not favorable for the spin qubit applications , but other spintronic applications as , e.g. , spin filters relying on this edge state have been proposed @xcite .",
    "the described stm experiments on graphene qds deposited on metals provide an unprecedented spatial resolution concerning the electronic properties of the qds , but they are difficult to be directly correlated to transport properties of graphene qds , which are typically measured on insulating substrates and which are defined in a top - down approach by etching and subsequent contacting of graphene flake structures using e - beam lithography @xcite .",
    "it is believed that the difficulties to control the qd transport properties in a similar way as in gaas @xcite is mostly due to the uncontrolled edge geometry and chemistry @xcite .",
    "this is distinct to the qds studied in uhv by stm , where these two parameters are well controlled .",
    "+ in order to locally probe transport qds , scanning gate microscopy has been used , which , however , suffers from a rather limited spatial resolution of about 100 nm @xcite .",
    "sts has a much higher spatial resolution , but requires that the qd is on the surface , since the tunneling current decays by an order of magnitude , if the tip - qd distance is increased by merely 1 @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the surface of the qd has to be free of insulating resist , which otherwise would be charged by the electric field of the tip . in turn , this charging of resist can change the local potential below the tip and , thus , the ldos contributing to the tunneling current @xcite .",
    "consequently , it is mandatory to structure and contact the graphene nanostructures without resist . + for contacting",
    ", one can either use shadow mask evaporation @xcite or contacting by microsoldering @xcite .",
    "we used the second method @xcite , which basically melts a fine wire of in onto the graphene sample held at about 155@xmath112 c. the in wire is pulled out of an in droplet by a typical stm tip made out of w. the positioning of this in wire onto the sample is afterwards done with micromanipulators under an optical microscope .",
    "this leads to a multitude of in contacts placed with a precision of 1 - 10 @xmath113 m as shown in fig . [",
    "fig11](a ) .",
    "in order to structure the graphene into a qd , we used local anodic oxidation ( lao ) by the tip of an afm @xcite .",
    "this technique has successfully been used previously to produce nanostructures in gaas @xcite .",
    "it also works on graphene @xcite , where , e.g. , quantum dots @xcite or constrictions @xcite made by lao have been probed by transport spectroscopy .",
    "+ the basic technique is to move the cantilever of an afm across the surface with a velocity @xmath114 nm / s while applying a negative tip bias @xmath115 .",
    "a controlled humidity leads to an adhesive droplet of water between tip and sample , where the electric field between tip and sample dissociates the h@xmath5o and guides the oxygen radical to the sample surface , such that an oxidation of the graphene can take place .",
    "the c - oxidation on graphene can be either complete leading to cuts in the graphene @xcite or incomplete , most likely leading to partially oxidized graphene nanoislands , which provide insulating layers , too @xcite .",
    "these partially oxidized areas appear elevated with respect to the intact graphene in tapping mode afm images .",
    "they are electrically insulating up to voltages of about 2 v @xcite .",
    "typically , cuts are surrounded by incompletely oxidized areas . reducing the tip voltage , in order to selectively produce the oxidized nanoislands ,",
    "leads to the laterally smallest insulating barriers . + as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11](b ) , we have produced a graphene qd with a diameter of about 60 nm using lao .",
    "this qd contains source ( s ) and drain ( d ) contacts and a number of plunger gates ( pg ) in order to tune the electrostatic potential of the qd and its tunneling barriers .",
    "the qd is placed on a si / sio@xmath5 substrate such that the highly doped si can act as a backgate .",
    "we could show that the etching process of graphene by lao also works on bn supports .",
    "+ figure [ fig11](c ) shows the measured 2-point conductance @xmath116 ( @xmath117 : voltage applied between s and d , @xmath118 : current measured in the circuit including s , d , and qd ) through the qd as a function of the backgate voltage @xmath119 revealing a @xmath119 area , where the conductance in between peaks drops towards zero as typical for coulomb blockade @xcite . zooming into this @xmath119",
    "area exhibits that the differential conductance @xmath120 indeed drops significantly between peaks of full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath121 mv .",
    "plotting the differential conductance as a function of @xmath119 and @xmath122 reveals the typical coulomb blockade structures ( fig .",
    "[ fig11](e ) ) known for qds @xcite .",
    "however , the patterns in fig .",
    "[ fig11](e ) appear like overlapped coulomb structures from qds connected in series .",
    "only a few of the diamonds like the one marked by a white dot have the characteristic shape of an isolated charging event and can be used to determine , e.g. , the lever arm of the back - gate voltage to the qd to be @xmath123 .",
    "most likely , our structure still suffers from additional confinement areas within the source and drain regions , which produce additional quantum dots in series , as partly observed in etched graphene qds , too @xcite .",
    "the size of the marked coulomb diamond fits reasonably to the qd area of fig .",
    "[ fig11](b ) . taking a qd area of @xmath124",
    "nm@xmath9 , a thickness of the sio@xmath5 of @xmath125 nm and a dielectric constant of @xmath126 , we get an estimated back - gate - qd capacitance @xmath127 using the plate capacitor model : @xmath128 dividing this by the lever arm @xmath129 results in a total capacitance of @xmath130 af such that we get a charging voltage of @xmath131 mv in reasonable correspondence to the 4 mv found for the marked coulomb diamond in fig . [ fig11](e ) . the remaining discrepancy is probably due to the inadequate plate capacitor model , since the size of the qd is smaller than its distance to the backgate leading , e.g. , to fringe field amplification @xcite .",
    "[ fig11](f ) shows that the graphene qd can also be tuned by the plunger gate with a much better lever arm close to @xmath132 , which is a typical value of @xmath129 as also found for etched graphene qds @xcite . using the charging voltage of the plunger gate to estimate its capacitance",
    ", we get @xmath133 af ( @xmath134 mv ) such that the six gates as well as source and drain can easily account for the lever arm of the back gate .",
    "+ thus , the anodic oxidation can produce graphene qds tunable by backgate and sidegates , where the latter exhibit and extremely strong tuning ability .",
    "moreover , the qds are produced without any resist , such that they can be probed by transport spectroscopy and scanning tunneling spectroscopy at the same time . a scanning tunneling microscope having five transport contacts for the sample , operating in uhv at 0.4 k , and in magnetic fields up to 14",
    "t is available @xcite , such that the mentioned experiments to map the quantum dot states responsible for transport are within reach .",
    "however , it would be favorable to probe quantum dots with isolated coulomb diamonds only , using , e.g. , a bn support @xcite .",
    "we have shown , that scanning tunneling spectroscopy of graphene nano - islands on metallic substrates , in particular on ir(111 ) and au(111 ) , can probe the squared wave functions of graphene qds , which are , however , intermixed with metallic surface states penetrating into the graphene layer .",
    "effective ways to decouple the surface states are either , physically , by intercalating oxygen between graphene and the metal or , analytically , by performing a fourier transformation provided that the real space images exhibit atomic resolution , such that the contributions from graphene states located at k and k and the metallic surface states located at @xmath0 get distinct in fourier space .",
    "first investigations of the graphene qd states on ir(111 ) showed that the soft confinement induced by the interaction between the graphene p@xmath1 orbital and the ir d@xmath2 orbital at @xmath3 leads to rather regular confined states , which are not prone to a detrimental k - k mixing by the edge of the qd .",
    "moreover , this interaction in combination with the 10% lattice mismatch between ir(111 ) and graphene suppresses the edge state , otherwise , typical for zigzag edges of graphene , such that it can not interfere with the spin properties of the confined state .",
    "in contrast , the edge state is predicted to be present , e.g. , on cu(111 ) , ag(111 ) and au(111 ) supports and it can be recovered by laterally interfacing the zigzag edges on ir(111 ) with bn and subsequently intercalating au .",
    "thus , a tunability of the graphene qds in a favorable or unfavorable way by the interaction with the substrate and/or the lateral interfaces has been demonstrated , which might be a helpful guide to tune quantum dot properties also for applications .",
    "+ in order to go beyond these model studies of graphene qds under well controlled conditions , we finally presented an approach to combine transport studies and scanning tunneling spectroscopy directly .",
    "therefore , we use local anodic oxidation for nanostructuring and subsequent microsoldering for contacting , such that the nanostructures are free of resist as required for the scanning probe studies . it will be interesting to see in",
    "how far this novel approach will ease an optimization of graphene qds , e.g. , with respect to applications as qubits , where graphene has large fundamental advantages with respect to other materials as gaas , but experimentally still lags significantly behind .",

    "<S> graphene quantum dots are considered as promising alternatives to quantum dots in iii - v semiconductors , e.g. , for the use as spin qubits due to their consistency made of light atoms including spin - free nuclei which both imply relatively long spin decoherene times . however </S>",
    "<S> , this potential has not been realized in experiments so far , most likely , due to a missing control of the edge configurations of the quantum dots . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a more fundamental investigation of graphene quantum dots appears to be necessary including a full control of the wave function properties most favorably during transport spectroscopy measurements . + here , </S>",
    "<S> we review the recent success in mapping wave functions of graphene quantum dots supported by metals , in particular ir(111 ) , and show how the goal of probing such wave functions on insulating supports during transport spectroscopy might be achieved .    </S>",
    "<S> graphene has moved in short time from first preparation as a small flake @xcite towards applications , partly already realized and partly anticipated for the near future , such as high frequency transistors @xcite , supercapacitors @xcite , or touch screens @xcite as recently reviewed by ferrari _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most of the applications are based on the exceptional properties of the material including true two - dimensionality , inertness , high room temperature mobility , large thermal conductivity , and extreme mechanical breaking strength @xcite . + </S>",
    "<S> another exciting plan is to use graphene quantum dots ( qds ) as spin qubits @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the basic requirement is a very long spin coherence time @xcite , which might exist in graphene @xcite due to the absence of hyperfine coupling in isotopically pure material and the small spin - orbit coupling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> first graphene qds have been produced early on and probed by transport measurements @xcite , meanwhile being able to determine charge relaxation times of about 60 - 100 ns @xcite . however , since graphene provides no natural gap , it is difficult to control the electron number @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the 2d sublattice symmetry makes the qd properties very susceptible to the atomic edge configuration @xcite in contrast to the behavior in conventional qds made , e.g. , out of gaas . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> chaotic dirac billiards have been predicted for graphene qds @xcite and were even claimed to be realized @xcite , i.e. the wave functions are probably rather disordered . to get more control on graphene qds , </S>",
    "<S> the qd edges must be well defined and a more fundamental understanding of the qd properties is mandatory . </S>",
    "<S> more recent transport investigations on graphene nanoconstrictions indeed support the idea of a decisive role of the edges for the localization properties within graphene nanostructures @xcite . + a direct insight into qd properties </S>",
    "<S> is provided by scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) . </S>",
    "<S> sts can map the squared wave functions of qds @xcite and , at the same time , determines the shape of the qd atom by atom . sts has also been applied successfully to graphene samples @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , conventional sts is restricted to conducting surfaces , such that first investigations of qd wave functions have been performed on graphene nanoislands prepared in ultra - high - vacuum ( uhv ) on metals @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more peculiar quantum dots have also been probed by scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) in uhv such as the ones induced by tip - induced strain on suspended graphene areas @xcite , the ones being present within localized areas of a quantum hall sample @xcite , or the ones confined in the suspended areas of the strongly buckled graphene on ru(0001 ) @xcite . + here , </S>",
    "<S> we firstly review the results of wave function mapping of graphene qds on ir(111 ) , which includes the probing of the zig - zag edges , appearing to be the energetically favorable edge type for this substrate @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the graphene qds exhibit squared wave functions @xcite , which are a mixture of graphene states from the dirac cone located in a projected band gap of the ir(111 ) @xcite and hole - type ir(111 ) surface states located around @xmath0 and exhibiting a strong rashba - type spin splitting @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of the two contributions within the qd can be disentangled by fourier transformation of the real space data , if atomic resolution is achieved @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution from the graphene dirac cone state can , moreover , be enhanced by oxygen intercalation between the graphene nano - islands and the ir(111 ) surface @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + interestingly , the edge configuration of the graphene quantum dots on ir(111 ) is quite unique by the hybridization of the graphene p@xmath1 orbitals with ir d@xmath2 orbitals , the latter being located rather exactly at the fermi level @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this , on the one hand side , suppresses the appearance of the famous edge state at zig - zag edges @xcite and , on the other hand side , leads to a soft confinement of the graphene quantum dot states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the confinement is not atomically abrupt , as one might anticipate from the abrupt end of carbon atoms at the rim of the island , but proceeds over 4 - 5 lattice constants . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the interference effects , coming from the coupling of the two valleys k and k and typically making the quantum dot wave functions chaotic , are suppressed @xcite , which , in turn , makes the wave functions rather regular . indeed , calculations of the atomically identical quantum dots , which are freely suspended and , thus , not prone to the interaction with the substrate , </S>",
    "<S> show strongly irregular wave functions distinct from the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> only the inclusion of the soft confinement potential could recover the experimental results . </S>",
    "<S> + thus , it is experimentally demonstrated that soft confinement leads to a significant regularization of states in graphene quantum dots and , thus , should be part of a strategy to exploit the potential of graphene quantum dots , e.g. , with respect to spin qubits @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + in addition , the soft confinement is able to suppress the graphene edge states . </S>",
    "<S> such states with almost flat bands at the dirac point energy @xmath4 are an intrinsic property of graphene zigzag edges , at least , if unsupported and unreconstructed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> experimental evidence for such edge states has indeed been found on different substrates such as hopg @xcite , si(100 ) @xcite , au(111 ) @xcite , cu(001 ) , if the graphene is laterally interfaced with bn , @xcite , arguably pt(111 ) @xcite , sic(0001 ) @xcite , and sio@xmath5 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> spectroscopic features at the step edges of ir(111 ) covered with graphene have also been interpreted in terms of graphene edge states @xcite , albeit it is known that the graphene layer is not interrupted at the ir step edges @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + density functional theory calculations indeed show that the edge state is present on cu(111 ) , ag(111 ) , and au(111 ) @xcite , but not on ir(111 ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is , moreover , shown that h - terminated zig - zag edges on au(111 ) are ferromagnetic , i.e. the edge state is located at @xmath3 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indirect evidence for such ferromagnetism of the edge state has been published @xcite , but without chemical control of the edge termination so far , @xmath6 being possible in principle @xcite . such edge state magnetism might be exploited for a multitude of spintronic applications  @xcite , but , on the other hand , it is detrimental for quantum dot functionality . thus , the edge state suppression by soft confinement , as on ir(111 ) , again improves the reliability of the quantum dot wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> + interestingly , the edge state can be recovered by laterally interfacing the graphene zig - zag edges on ir(111 ) with bn and subsequently intercalating au between the graphene / bn layer and the ir(111 ) surface @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> this goal is also pursued by scanning gate microscopy @xcite , but the achieved spatial resolution so far only allows to locate the center of the corresponding wave functions without any details @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> combining transport and scanning tunneling microscopy is possible in principle , if the nanostructures are produced without resist as , e.g. , by anodic oxidation using an atomic force microscope ( afm ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this technique has been shown to work on graphene , too @xcite , and to produce operating quantum dot structures @xcite . besides cuts , where the graphene is removed @xcite , the graphene can also be oxidized @xcite or hydrogenated @xcite , which eventually could lead to smaller , insulating device boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , this method does not leave any resist on the surface , which would disturb the sts measurements significantly due to a remote charging of the resist by the tip , which electrostatically would back - act on the area probed by sts @xcite . combining this afm based structuring method with a contacting method , which does not use any resist either as , e.g. , microsoldering by in @xcite , provides an adequate nanostructure to be probed both , by sts and transport spectroscopy simultaneously . + </S>",
    "<S> in order to scan across the insulting barriers , the scanning tip has to be mounted on a tuning fork @xcite , such that the feedback can operate in scanning force mode while tunneling , or , alternatively , a capacitive feedback must be used @xcite . </S>"
