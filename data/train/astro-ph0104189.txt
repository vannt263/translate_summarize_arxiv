    "since the discovery of quasars , absorption line studies have been proposed to probe the prevailing conditions in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "initially ( gunn & peterson 1965 , sargent 1980 , blades , turnshek & norman 1988 ) , most interest was focused on the redshifted ly@xmath4 resonance line of neutral hydrogen arising in the so - called ly@xmath4 forest .",
    "more recently , the technique has been extended to search for absorption lines associated with ionized heavy elements ( cowie 1995 ; tytler 1995 ; lu 1998 ; cowie & songaila 1998 ; ellison 1999 , 2000 ) and it will likely be possible to use it to investigate the existence of an analogous x - ray forest ( hellsten 1998 , perna & loeb 1998 ) .",
    "these experiments are sensitive to different states and physical processes of the gas : ly@xmath4 lines can give information on the neutral component of the igm , whereas the other two applications can be used to probe heavy elements and the processes responsible for their ionization , likely photo- and collisional ionization .",
    "however , most of the baryonic mass in the universe is in the form of ionized hydrogen : for example in ly@xmath4 clouds at @xmath5 the neutral fraction is typically only @xmath6 . at lower redshift ,",
    "at least 40% of the baryons in the universe reside in a warm / hot component of the igm ( cen & ostriker 1999 , dav 2000 ) .",
    "thus , it is certainly useful to think of independent ways to detect it .    as light waves",
    "traverse an ionized distribution of gas , they suffer a phase change caused by variations in the average refractive index related to random irregularities in the medium .",
    "this process is known as scintillation , as , among other effects , it produces a wave amplitude fluctuation .",
    "scintillation has been widely used at radio frequencies in the study of the interstellar medium of the milky way ( mw ) and a large literature is available ( for a general introduction we defer the reader to the excellent reviews by rickett 1977 and 1990 and goodman & narayan 1985 ) .",
    "these experiments have brought a tremendous advance towards the understanding of the spatial distribution and small scale structure of the ionized component of the ism ( see for example armstrong , rickett & spangler 1995 and references therein ) . for example , local observations have established that the power spectrum of density irregularities has a power - law dependence on the wavenumber @xmath7 , with @xmath8 .",
    "intriguingly , this spectrum resembles the one expected in the inertial range for a fully developed kolmogorov turbulence .",
    "however , recent work ( lambert & rickett 2000 ) suggests that at large scale it might become steeper ( @xmath9 ) , approaching the spectrum produced by a random distribution of clumps or by a a complex pattern of overlapping shock waves . a point worth stressing",
    "is that there is no requirement that density irregularities be produced by turbulence , although this is probably the case in the interstellar medium of the mw .",
    "indeed , any physical effect ( shocks , photoionization , gravity , instabilities ) producing a spatially inhomogeneous ionized medium would also be necessarily responsible for scintillation effects .",
    "hence , it seems that , if the sophisticated experimental and theoretical tools developed for interstellar applications could be successfully imported into igm studies , scintillation could complement very interestingly the ongoing absorption line observations .",
    "it has to be pointed out that , being scintillation insensitive to the gas temperature as long as it is ionized , in principle it can be used to trace both the cool ( @xmath10  k ) gas residing either in the ( mildly overdense ) ly@xmath4 clouds or in the halos of low mass ( @xmath11 ) systems , and the warm / hot gas ( @xmath12  k ) originating from the virialization of groups / clusters or shocked by cosmic explosions .    in spite of its excellent credit history and of the number of important cosmological problems that it could potentially address , scintillation due to intergalactic gas has received much little attention .",
    "application have been made in the past to flickering of extragalactic sources ( rickett , coles , bourgois 1984 , blandford , narayan & romani 1986 , shishov 1989 , spangler 1989 , walker 1998 ) , extreme scattering events ( fiedler 1994 ) or , more recently , to gamma - ray bursts ( goodman 1997 ; frail 1997 ; waxman , kulkarni & frail 1998 ) .",
    "however , virtually all such studies have been tried to infer properties of the galactic interstellar medium or of the source .",
    "here we take a different perspective and our aim is to show that scintillation can provide fresh insights into the properties of intergalactic medium by long - term radio monitoring of distant quasars ; to our knowledge , only a paper ( yoshioka 1970 ) has suggested such possibility to date , although it has been hinted by a few other papers ( dennison & condon 1981 ; goodman 1997 , cordes & lazio 2000 ) .",
    "we show how the scintillation signal produced by an intergalactic distribution of ionized gas can be comparable to the standard interstellar one and , more importantly , easily disentangled from that . in this application",
    "we focus on the intracluster / intragroup gas .",
    "we consider scintillation of quasar light by a foreground cluster .",
    "observations of the @xmath13-ray surface brightness of galaxy clusters are commonly fitted by the isothermal @xmath14 model , in which the gas temperature is constant and the radial profile of its mass density is given by _",
    "gas(r , t)=_0(t)^-3/2 , [ rhog ] where @xmath15 is the core radius .",
    "typical values for the parameters of this fit are clustered around @xmath16 and @xmath17 mpc ( jones & forman 1984 ) , and we adopt these values in our calculations .",
    "the central density is found by matching at large radii ( @xmath18 ) the density profile to that of an isothermal sphere .",
    "this yields _ 0(t)= , [ eq : rho0 ] where @xmath19 , @xmath20 cosmology throughout the discussion . ]",
    "is the mass fraction of the gas and @xmath21 its temperature , @xmath22 is the proton mass , and @xmath23 is the mean atomic weight . we assign a cutoff radius @xmath24 so that the overdensity at the cluster boundary is about 10 times the critical density .    whereas it seems plausible that gas turbulent motions exist in clusters ,",
    "the turbulent spectrum has not been determined so far . in the galaxy ,",
    "the power spectrum of the density fluctuations is well described by the kolmogorov spectrum , _",
    "n(q)=c_n^2 q^--2 , [ eq : pn ] where @xmath25 . in our calculations",
    ", we assume this spectral form for the gas density fluctuations over a range of scales from @xmath26 cm to @xmath27 cm . this range is the typical one for the scales of `` refractive '' inhomogeneities in the interstellar medium ( lambert & rickett 2000 ) and , lacking better information , we assume it for the clusters as well .",
    "the integral of @xmath28 along the line of sight is called the scattering measure sm@xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the distance to the source . in the problem that we are considering",
    ", it can be written as = 2c_n,0 ^ 2_0^x_maxdx , [ eq : sm ] having chosen a system of coordinates where @xmath31 corresponds to the center of the cluster .",
    "here , @xmath32 is the impact parameter ( also measured from the cluster center ) , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is the value of @xmath35 at the center of the cluster . it can be written in terms of the nominal galactic value as @xmath36 ^ 2 $ ] , where @xmath37 , and @xmath38 ( e.g. goodman 1997 ) .",
    "the physically important quantity for scintillation is the longitudinal gradient of the phase structure function d_(s , z;)= 8 ^ 2 r^2_e^2_0^ _ n(,z ; q_z=0)[1- j_0(s ) ] d , [ eq : dphi ] where @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is the direction of propagation along the line of sight . here",
    "@xmath41 is the speed of light , @xmath42 the classic electron radius , and @xmath43 the observation wavelength . for a plane wave incident on a scattering medium",
    ", the line of sight integral of @xmath44 gives the structure function of the geometric optics phase , or wave - structure function @xmath45 .",
    "the field coherence length at the observer , @xmath46 , is defined by @xmath47 .",
    "the characteristic scattering angle is then defined by ( see e.g. goodman 1997 ) _",
    "d== 2.93_10 ^ -11/5_-3.5 ^ 3/5 , [ eq : tetad ] where @xmath48 and sm@xmath49 .    for a pointlike source",
    ", @xmath50 can represent either a displacement in the apparent position of the source , or a broadening of its angular size .",
    "this depends on the magnitude of @xmath50 relative to the fresnel angle _ f()^1/2 2.57 _ 10 ^ -1/2d_scr , kpc^-1/2 , [ eq : tetaf ] where @xmath51 is the distance to the screen in kpc .",
    "if @xmath52 , the scatterers can displace the image but not divide it .",
    "this is the weak scattering regime . on the other hand , if @xmath53 , then multiple images of the source are formed , and in this case @xmath50 can be interpreted as the effective size of the scatter - broadened source image",
    "this is the strong scattering regime .",
    "flux scintillation can occur in two forms , diffractive and refractive .",
    "diffractive scintillation is a physical - optics interference effect , and can only occur if the scattering is strong , when multiple subimages of the source are formed .",
    "the ray path from source to observer is different for each subimage , and if the receiving telescope is too small to separate these subimages , then the observed flux is given by the coherent sum of the contributions from all paths .",
    "each subimage is analogous to a slit , and on an imaginary plane perpendicular to the line of sight and passing through the observer , the flux forms a speckle pattern .",
    "the characteristic size of a speckle is @xmath54 . in order for the speckle pattern not to be smoothed out by source size effects , it is necessary that the intrinsic angular size of the source @xmath55 be @xmath56 .",
    "when scintillation is due to an extragalactic screen , this condition requires a size which is much smaller than the emitting region of a quasar .",
    "therefore , diffractive scintillation is quenched , and only refractive scintillation becomes possible in our context ( see also discussion below ) .",
    "refractive scintillation is a geometric - optics effect consisting in the random magnification of individual subimages .",
    "for an extended source it is negligible until the scattering becomes very strong , and @xmath57 .",
    "the effective image of the source is given by the convolution of its intrinsic surface brightness distribution with the scatter - broadened image of a point source .",
    "this can be written as ( goodman 1997 ) _ eff^1/2 .",
    "[ eq : tetaeff ] the effective image , being an incoherent source , can only be lensed by fluctuations which are at least as large as its projection on the scattering screen ; this implies fluctuations of size @xmath58 .",
    "inhomogeneities much larger than this scale are also ineffective because they result in a weak scattering strength , low values of @xmath59 .",
    "refractive scintillation is therefore dominated by fluctuations on the order of @xmath60 .",
    "this sets the typical timescale of the flux modulation to t_r=. [ eq : tref ] in the case we are considering , this relative motion is dominated by the velocity of the inhomogeneities themselves .",
    "a reasonable lower limit for this value is given by the sound speed in the intracluster medium .",
    "here we assume a cluster temperature @xmath61  kev , as appropriate for the coma cluster ( mohr , mathiesen & evrard 1999 ) ; the corresponding sound speed is roughly 1100 km  s@xmath62 .",
    "therefore we use @xmath63  km  s@xmath62 , which is also in agreement with the value assumed for the turbulent velocity of the gas in hot clusters by sarazin ( 1989 ) . note that the value of @xmath64 affects the refractive time scale linearly according to the above equation .",
    "the strength of refractive scintillation is expressed in terms of the root - mean - square flux variation relative to the mean , @xmath65 , where @xmath66 ( with @xmath67 ) is the intensity covariance ; @xmath68 is referred to as the _ modulation index_. in the situation that we are considering , where the scattering occurs in a cluster at cosmological distance ( but still much smaller than the distance to the source ) , we can adopt the thin screen approximation , in which one assumes that the scattering is concentrated in a narrow layer at distance @xmath69 .",
    "the modulation index can then be well approximated by ( goodman 1997 )    @xmath70",
    "an important assumption of our study concerns the existence of sources that are compact enough to produce the refractive scintillation pattern that we are predicting .",
    "this translates in the condition @xmath71 .",
    "a discussion of this assumption seems worthwhile .",
    "the intrinsic size of a source emitting _ incoherent _ synchrotron radiation can be obtained from its brightness temperature @xmath72 .",
    "radio observations typically test the rayleigh part of the black - body curve .",
    "hence we have @xmath73 which defines @xmath72 . equating @xmath74 to the measured flux of the source , @xmath75 divided by the solid angle subtended by the source , @xmath76 one obtains for the measure units ] @xmath77 the expression for @xmath50",
    "is given by equation  ( [ eq : tetad ] ) .",
    "using the typical values sm = sm@xmath78 and @xmath79 , we get @xmath80 this implies that for the above ratio to be larger than , say , three , one needs @xmath72 to be in excess of few @xmath81  k. upper limits on @xmath72 are given by the condition on inverse compton cooling ( kellerman & pauliny - toth 1969 ) which imply that the brightness temperature for incoherent synchrotron emission has to be lower than @xmath82  k. above that value , sources would undergo catastrophic cooling ; this condition therefore represents a ( wavelength independent ) theoretical limit on @xmath72 .",
    "however , many sources are observed for which a @xmath72 higher than this value has been estimated ( romero 1994 , quirrenbach 1992 , tersranta & valtoja 1994 ) .",
    "observationally , it is well established that these sources , known as blazars , commonly show variability on time scales of hours ( the so - called intraday variability [ idv ] , for a review see wagner & witzel 1995 ) . if this variability is internal , then the upper limit on the size is @xmath83  cm . at cosmological distances of about 1 gpc",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath84a.s .",
    "consequently , inferred values of the brightness temperature are in the range @xmath85  k.    one possible explanation ( rees 1966 ; woltjer 1966 ) is that these sources are relativistically beamed by a doppler factor @xmath86 $ ] .",
    "as @xmath72 scales as @xmath87 , one requires @xmath88 to account for the highest @xmath72 sources .",
    "these doppler factors are however too high with respect to those inferred from superluminal motions ( @xmath89 ) and for @xmath90-ray fluxes to be compatible with @xmath91 pair absorption , also implying @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , as the required values of @xmath72 ( even allowing for a very large doppler factor ) implied by this compactness are implausibly large , one has to admit that , at least for this class of sources , the observed radiation is _ coherent _ , so that the above discussed compton limit does not apply .",
    "alternatively , one can note that idv can have an external origin , for example microlensing or scintillation by the ism ( time scales are too short for the igm to contribute appreciably ) .",
    "one of the most stringent arguments in support of this interpretation is that low - frequency variable sources are almost always located behind large scale galactic structures ( shapirovskaya 1978 ) .",
    "hence , scintillation implies that at these frequencies the source is compact enough to produce refractive scintillation on such short timescales .",
    "the extreme brightness temperatures of @xmath93k that would be deduced by an intrinsic interpretation of the fastest idv were rejected in the papers announcing the observations ( kedziora - chudczer 1997 , and dennett - thorpe & de bruyn 2000 ) .",
    "these authors favor an iss model ; a view also supported by rickett ( 1995 ) for a more conventional idv source . at higher frequencies , if the necessary compactness is maintained is not known . in any case , at present there are no theoretical or observational arguments that can rule out this possibility , and idv blazars appear to represent the most suitable background candidates for our study .",
    "we start by analyzing the behavior of the refractive time scale ( fig .",
    "1 ) , @xmath94 , as a function of the impact parameter @xmath32 ( in units of @xmath15 ) at which the line of sight to a quasar intersects the cluster hot gas distribution . in the cases we discuss , the quasar ( source )",
    "is assumed to be located at @xmath95 whereas the cluster ( screen ) is taken to be at @xmath96 .",
    "we also consider two different values for @xmath97 ( 0.04 , 0.2 ) that should encompass a reasonable variation range for this parameter ; for the observation frequency we consider the cases of 100  ghz and 50  ghz .",
    "the time scale of refractive scintillation ranges from about a day to several months , depending on the position within the cluster and the frequency of observation .",
    "here we have considered the case of a point source , for which @xmath98 . the refractive time scale is then determined by the largest between @xmath50 and @xmath99 . in the inner part of the cluster , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 .",
    "the time scales in this region are very sensitive to the value of sm , and therefore of @xmath97 . in the outer part , on the other hand , @xmath99 is larger than @xmath50 , and the refractive time scale becomes @xmath102 , which is independent of sm , but is essentially determined by the frequency of observation and the distance to the screen .",
    "changing @xmath103 in the range @xmath104 does not appreciably change the results .",
    "the reason is that the distance to the source only enters the definition of the source intrinsic angular size , which we assumed here to be negligible with respect to @xmath50 in the expression of @xmath105 .",
    "the results are more sensitive to variations in @xmath106 , and the time scale roughly increases as @xmath107 . as the observation frequency decreases ,",
    "the refractive time scales increases .",
    "hence , it appears that frequencies in the range considered here provide the best detection prospectives for extragalactic scintillation .    in fig .",
    "2 , we show the refractive modulation index @xmath68 calculated for the same observation frequencies , @xmath108  ghz and @xmath109  ghz .",
    "the modulation index is generally on the order of several tens of percent , and it varies significantly with both frequency and baryonic fraction @xmath97 . in the inner region of the cluster , scintillation is in the strong regime ; here @xmath110 , and equation  ( [ eq : mr ] ) is reduced to @xmath111 .",
    "the intensity of the modulation increases with frequency and decreases with sm ( and therefore with @xmath97 ) .",
    "this behaviour is inverted in the outer parts of the cluster , where the regime becomes weak .",
    "here @xmath112 , and equation  ( [ eq : mr ] ) is roughly given by @xmath113 .",
    "note that , even though the regime here is weak and the scattering measure is smaller than the galactic value , there can still be a relatively strong signal due to the fact that the screen is at a cosmological distance .    as in figure 1",
    ", the results in figure 2 have been computed for the case of a very compact source , and this is a crucial assumption in order to have a significant signal .",
    "in fact , as the size of the source increases and becomes larger than @xmath50 , @xmath99 , the amplitude of the fluctuations is reduced . in the limit",
    "where @xmath114 , one has @xmath115 , and , using equation  ( [ eq : mr ] ) , one can see that the modulation index is roughly given by @xmath116 in the strong scattering regime , and by @xmath117 in the weak regime .",
    "the suppression in the modulation of the signal as the size of the source is increased is explicitly shown in figure 3 . for a given source size @xmath118 , the amount of suppression is different in the various parts of the cluster . in the innermost regions , where @xmath50 is larger , source size effects become noticeable for @xmath119 cm . in the outer parts , where the ratio @xmath120 is smaller , the suppression becomes evident for smaller sizes and , for a source of @xmath121 cm at @xmath122 , the modulation of the signal is reduced to only a few percent .",
    "furthermore , note that , while reducing the modulation , a large source also makes the refractive time scale longer , of a factor on the order of @xmath123 in the strong regime , and of @xmath124 in the weak case .",
    "we have presented an extension of standard scintillation experiments to probe the intergalactic medium ; in particular , we have considered the case of intracluster gas .",
    "we have found that clusters located at redshift around a tenth should produce an rms intensity fluctuation at 50 - 100 ghz of several tens of percent on time scales ranging from about a day to several months , depending on the projected location of the source with respect to the cluster radius .",
    "this effect , if observed , can yield valuable information on the baryonic fraction ( @xmath125 ) and the spectrum of inhomogeneities of the intracluster gas .",
    "more generally , this technique could be particularly important to study the warm / hot gas predicted to act as a reservoir of the majority of baryons at low redshift .",
    "in fact , we have mentioned that scintillation is not sensitive to temperature , as long as the gas is ionized .",
    "however , only the largest objects ( clusters and groups of galaxies ) can reach a sufficiently high scattering measure to produce a significant fluctuation level .",
    "thus , it appears that scintillation is a perfect tool to investigate hot gas , presumably in large virialized objects .",
    "constraints on the baryonic mass fraction in clusters that can complement those obtained from emission / absorption line measurements and from the sunyaev - zeldovich effect should be obtainable if scintillation will be observed .",
    "scintillation is particularly effective to probe gas at very large radii , which is difficult to probe with @xmath13-ray instruments",
    ".    the proposed method can be also very important in assessing the level of turbulence in the intracluster medium , if the data will come out to be consistent with our predictions based on the assumption that a density fluctuation spectrum is close to the one expected for kolmogorov turbulence .",
    "turbulence has been often invoked in the cluster environment to provide efficient mechanism for heavy element mixing ; it can be generated both by stirring of the gas by galaxy motions , shocks ( both due to virialization and by galactic outflows ) , mergings and also by kelvin - helmoltz instabilities occurring at the boundaries of galaxies as they move through the intracluster medium ( goldman & raphaeli 1991 , de young 1992 , westbury & henriksen 1992 , goldshmidt & raphaeli 1993 , sanchez - salcedo , brandenburg & shukurov 1998 , mori & burkert 2000 ) .",
    "however , this phenomenon is still awaiting firm , direct detections .",
    "we have shown that intergalactic scintillation might well provide one .",
    "observations on long time scales obviously require some care as they can be affected by several spurious effects .",
    "flux modulations due to scintillation should however be easily isolated from flux variations due to other causes .",
    "amplifications due to microlensing are achromatic , and therefore distinguishable from the frequency dependent scintillation , whereas intrinsic variations are not expected to be of periodic nature and to have the same frequency dependence as scintillation .",
    "multiwavelength observations , as already available for several objects ( e.g. bloom et al .",
    "1999 ) , would therefore be most useful to such purpose .",
    "if more than one source were found behind a cluster , then the dependence of the signal on the impact parameter would also be very distinctive of scintillation .",
    "a contribution to refractive scintillation by the galactic ism is also possible .",
    "however , for most of the cluster ( where the regime is weak and @xmath126 ) , the contribution to the modulation index by the igm should largely dominate over that from the ism . for a cluster at @xmath127 , we have @xmath128 , and therefore the contribution to @xmath129 from the igm will dominate over that from the ism for @xmath130 . at the same time , the refractive time scale at 100 ghz , obtained assuming a screen with sm = sm@xmath131 located at 1 kpc from the observer , is on the order of an hour , thus much shorter than the one due to the hot cluster gas .    in principle , one can also think of applications to the `` true '' igm , the diffuse intergalactic gas observed via ly@xmath4 absoption lines .",
    "for an einstein - de sitter universe with @xmath132 , the igm scattering measure due to a uniformly distributed igm up to a redshift @xmath40 is @xmath133 , implying that a contribution can occur only for sources located at very high @xmath40 .",
    "in addition , the typical doppler parameters observed in the ly@xmath4 forest are at most a few tens of km  s@xmath62 , thus making @xmath134 much longer .",
    "we conclude that a scintillation component arising from the true igm would be hardly detectable .",
    "an important assumption in our discussion regards the compactness of the source .",
    "we have discussed the decrease of @xmath68 when the source size is increased and we have shown ( fig .",
    "3 ) that compact sources are needed in order to have a significant modulation of the signal .    using eq .",
    "( 12 ) , it is easy to show that the relation linking the source size @xmath118 with its brightness temperature is t_b = 3.6 10 ^ 15 s_,mjy _",
    "ghz^-2_s,16 ^ -2   k , [ bright ] which gives @xmath135  k for @xmath79 , @xmath136 , and @xmath137 cm . for these values ,",
    "the modulation index is @xmath138 at the cluster center , and @xmath139 when sm = sm@xmath140 .",
    "what we now need to estimate is the surface density in the sky of the idv sources which have the required brightness temperature .",
    "idv in radio - loud sources has only been seen in objects with flat spectra ( flat spectrum radio quasars , fsrq ) , @xmath141 ; among these sources about 25% show idv ( ghisellini , private communication ) .",
    "for the differential number counts of fsrq we use the results of padovani & urry ( 1992 ) ( see their fig .",
    "5 ) ; at @xmath79 they find 108 such sources ( or 27 idv sources ) per steradian .",
    "thus , the probability of finding one such object behind the central @xmath142 mpc region of our reference cluster at @xmath143 is about 3% , i.e. a small but nonnegligible occurrence chance .",

    "we thank a. celotti , g. ghisellini , h. susa and m. umemura for useful discussions .",
