    "the thermal gas in galaxy clusters provides a historical record of the activity within the last @xmath1 yr in the cluster . without recent ( significant ) merger activity ,",
    "the cluster gas relaxes to hydrostatic equilibrium . in a relaxed cluster ,",
    "the thermal gas distribution is relatively smooth and symmetric in the outer cluster regions , while the inner regions show very peaked x - ray emission which has often been interpreted as a cooling - flow @xcite .",
    "the inner regions of these clusters generally contain large cd galaxies , which usually show evidence for cooler gas ( e.g. , optical line emission ) and star formation .",
    "these central cd galaxies typically host powerful radio sources which , in some cases , appear to trigger star formation .",
    "recent @xmath2 observations have revealed that there also appears to be a complex interplay between the central radio sources and the thermal intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "x - ray observations of clusters such as perseus @xcite , hydra a @xcite , a2052 @xcite , and centaurus @xcite with rosat and @xmath2 show depressions ( or bubbles ) in the thermal gas that appear to be spatially coincident with the radio lobes .",
    "the interplay between the thermal and radio plasma is complex .",
    "contrary to predictions of supersonic expansion of radio sources @xcite , the x - ray observations of these clusters do not reveal the presence of strong shocks near the radio lobes .",
    "the radio sources appear to expand subsonically or mildly transonically into the icm and slowly displace the thermal gas @xcite .",
    "this displacement of the x - ray gas is thought to lead to the bright rims of cool gas observed along the edges of the radio lobes .",
    "the cool nature of this gas has been determined by the observed soft x - ray spectrum ( perseus , @xcite ; a2052 , @xcite ) . in turn , the dense cluster medium is thought to confine the radio source and produce the compact , distorted morphology typical of cooling core systems .",
    "equipartition arguments applied to these systems suggest that the minimum energy pressure in the radio lobes is an order of magnitude less than the surrounding thermal gas pressure ( hydra a , @xcite ; perseus , @xcite ; a2052 , @xcite ; @xcite )",
    ". without some form of internal pressure support ( such as hot , diffuse thermal gas ) these x - ray depressions would collapse on sound crossing timescales of @xmath3 yr .    in a few clusters ,",
    "x - ray observations have revealed the presence of cavities ( `` ghost holes '' ) in the thermal icm which are located well beyond the radius of the currently active central radio galaxy ( e.g. , perseus , @xcite ; a2597 , @xcite ; a4059 , @xcite ) .",
    "these ghost holes are thought to be buoyant lobes from a past outburst of the radio galaxy which have displaced the thermal gas as they rose through the cluster atmosphere .",
    "observational evidence suggests that radio galaxies undergo episodic outbursts which last @xmath3 yr and have repetition intervals of @xmath1 yr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "over the cluster lifetime , the activity of the central radio galaxy would produce many generations of radio lobes .",
    "each generation of buoyant bubbles may entrain cool cluster gas as it moves outward in the cluster atmosphere , thus lowering the total mass inflow in the cluster core .",
    "in addition , recent observations of perseus @xcite and m87 @xcite show ripples that suggest that each generation of radio outburst sends weak shocks through the icm . these shocks dissipate energy which may be sufficient to balance the effects of radiative cooling in the cluster cores . in this scenario",
    ", episodic central radio sources may provide the solution to the `` cooling flow problem '' ( the lack of sufficient quantities of cool gas in the cores of dense clusters ) . due to a balance between buoyancy and drag forces",
    ", the bubbles will rise at a fraction of the sound speed in the thermal gas ; thus , the locations of the bubbles can be used to place constraints on the lifecycle of the central radio galaxy .",
    "buoyant bubbles also provide a means of transporting magnetic fields from the central active galactic nucleus to the outer cluster regions where the fields have been detected to radii of over 500 kpc @xcite .",
    "the bubbles also contain aging relativistic particles which may be re - accelerated during a cluster merger to produce the diffuse radio relics which have been observed in some systems @xcite .    in this paper we present results of a radio and x - ray analysis of the cluster abell  2597 .",

    "the central region of abell 2597 was observed with _ chandra _ on 2000 july 28 for a total of 39.4 ksec .",
    "the observations were taken in faint ( f ) mode with the cluster center on the back - illuminated s3 chip .",
    "the acis-236789 chips were on and operating at a temperature of @xmath10 c and a frame time of 3.2 s. the archival observation ( obsid 922 ) was extracted and reprocessed using ciao v3.0.2 , and caldb v2.26 .",
    "only events with @xmath11 grades 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 were included in the analysis .",
    "the observations did not include data from the other back - illuminated ( s1 ) ccd , hence the flare filtering was undertaken using the s3 chip .",
    "regions surrounding the bright part of the cluster and compact sources were excluded when determining the light curve . as discussed previously by @xcite ,",
    "the observations were severely impacted by flares . in an effort to extract as much information as possible from the data , we have not followed the standard flare - filtering routines . in this paper , we concentrate on the @xmath2 images of the bright central region of the cluster , and do not undertake spectral fits ; thus , we have not filtered out all data impacted by flares . we have only clipped off the strongest parts of the flares but still include data with up to 8.5 times the mean quiescent background rate .",
    "this filtering retains @xmath5 32 ksec of data , which gives enough photons to examine the detailed spatial structure of the thermal gas in the central regions .",
    "we examined the impact of the high cutoff for the flare filtering by determining the contribution of the background counts to the counts in the central region of the cluster discussed in this paper . using the standard flare - filtering cutoff we estimated the total counts in the off - source region of the s3 chip . due to the large size of clusters",
    ", this region will contain both cluster and background counts .",
    "we used the quiescent background estimate of 0.86 cts / s / chip for the s3 chip ( properly scaled to the relevant area ) to subtract the quiescent background and determine the cluster contribution in the @xmath12 kev band .",
    "this contribution was removed from the counts determined for the off - source region in our relaxed flare - filtering data set . scaling the remaining quiescent plus background flare counts to the area of interest in this paper ,",
    "the background is found to contribute only 1.1% of the source counts . given this very small contribution to the counts and the overall spatial uniformity of the background flares , the spatial structure of the features discussed below are not influenced by our relaxed filtering criteria .",

    "this method provides a conservative estimate that the tunnel is an 18@xmath19 deficit over the remainder of the annulus . using a similar approach to determine the significance of the eastern bubble by comparing the counts in a 30  pie wedge on the hole to the remainder of the annulus ( excluding the 30  wedge on the tunnel ) we find it represents a 7@xmath19 deficit .    in figure",

    "the core of the 5 ghz radio source sits on the border of the complex x - ray residual structure with the southern jet and lobe located at the edge of the x - ray tunnel , and the northern lobe bounded to the north and east by regions of excess and to the northeast by a region of x - ray deficit .",
    "given the compact nature of the 5 ghz source , it may be very difficult , even with deeper @xmath2 observations , to image the region around the inner radio structure accurately enough to determine if the inner lobes are interacting with the thermal gas .",
    "the 1.3 ghz radio contours surround the 5 ghz source and reveal an extension toward the east to a distance of roughly 16 kpc from the compact radio core .",

    "the calculations use a spectral index of @xmath29 determined between 330 mhz and 1.3 ghz for the tunnel , and a radio extension size of @xmath30 kpc . using a model with the magnetic field perpendicular to the line of sight , and lower and upper cutoff frequencies of 10 mhz and 100 ghz",

    ", suggests that the electrons have been ( re)accelerated in - situ in the x - ray tunnel .",
    "although the buoyancy rise time is likely an underestimate due to the unknown projection effects , we note also that the radio spectrum may flatten below 330 mhz along the western extension , and thus the synchrotron lifetime of the particles may be somewhat longer than calculated above . assuming a spectral index of @xmath36 , minimum energy estimates give a synchrotron lifetime of @xmath37 yr . more detailed radio and x - ray observations are required to further investigate these timescales .",
    "the high frequency observations reveal that the inner southern jet deflects toward the south at the location of a bright ly@xmath27 blob @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the western extension was previously fed by the radio jet prior to deflection , or it may represent a buoyantly rising lobe from a previous outburst . alternatively , if the inner radio structure is porous , the tunnel may be fed by a continuous flow of radio plasma from the inner jets as suggested by @xcite for m87 .",
