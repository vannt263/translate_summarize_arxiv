    "resonant x - ray scattering has recently attracted much interest as a useful tool to investigate magnetic and orbital orders .",
    "the resonant enhancement for magnetic bragg reflections has been observed in transition - metal compounds@xcite using synchrotron radiation with photon energy around the @xmath0 edge .",
    "also the resonant enhancement for the prohibited bragg reflection corresponding to the orbital order has been observed in lamno@xmath5 .",
    "@xcite the resonant scattering is described by a second order process that a photon is virtually absorbed by exciting a core electron to unoccupied states and then emitted by recombining the excited electron with the core hole .",
    "therefore , for the @xmath0 edge , the @xmath1 states are involved in the dipolar process , while the @xmath2 states are involved in the quadrupolar process .",
    "since the @xmath1 states are highly extended in space , they are rather sensitive to electronic structure at neighboring sites .",
    "this character is now well recognized in the resonant scattering for the orbital order in lamno@xmath5 ; at the beginning , proposed was a mechanism that the intensity comes from the @xmath1 states modified by the intra - atomic coulomb interaction with the @xmath2 electrons constituting the orbital order,@xcite but the subsequent studies of treating the @xmath1 states as a band@xcite have revealed that the @xmath1 states of mn is mainly modified by the jahn - teller distortion via the oxygen potential on the neighboring sites , not by the intra - atomic coulomb interaction .    in this paper",
    ", we study the mechanism of the resonant x - ray scattering for the magnetic order ( rxms ) in nio .",
    "we analyze the recent experiment of neubeck _",
    "et al._,@xcite paying special attentions to the band effects of the @xmath1 states . in nio ,",
    "ni atoms form an fcc lattice .",
    "it is a type ii antiferromagnet ( af ) with the nel temperature @xmath6 k. the order parameter is characterized by a wavevector @xmath7 , which is directed to one of four body - diagonals in the fcc lattice .",
    "therefore there exist four domains ( @xmath0 domains ) .",
    "the spin vector lies in the plane perpendicular to the af modulation direction so that there are three possible directions ( @xmath8 domains ) .",
    "for example , the spins are directed to @xmath9 , @xmath10 , or @xmath11 in the @xmath0 domain of @xmath12 . in total",
    ", we have 12 domains . in the rxms experiment for nio ,",
    "the @xmath0 domain is specified , but the @xmath8 domains are mixed.@xcite    for generating the rxms intensity , orbitals have to coupled to the magnetic order ; in the dipolar process , the @xmath1 states have to couple to the @xmath2 states .",
    "since such couplings are usually much smaller than those to the jahn - teller distortion in lamno@xmath5 , the mechanism is much subtler than that for the orbital order in lamno@xmath5 .",
    "the spin polarization alone in the @xmath1 band can not give rise to the rxms intensity ; if the amplitudes of exciting electron are summed for up and down spins , the total becomes the same at each site in the absence of the orbital moment .",
    "this leads to the cancellation of the amplitudes between different magnetic sublattices .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction in the @xmath1 band may break this cancellation , @xcite but its effect will be shown to be negligibly small .",
    "as discussed in our previous paper for coo,@xcite we propose that two couplings are effective to make the @xmath1 states couple to the magnetic order : the intra - atomic coulomb interaction between the @xmath1 and @xmath2 states , and the mixing of the @xmath1 states with the @xmath2 states of neighboring ni atoms . to substantiate this observation",
    ", we use a tight - binding model for the @xmath1 states , treating the @xmath2 states within a cluster model .",
    "we will show that these couplings actually give rise to the rxms spectra in agreement with the recent experiment.@xcite a caution is to be made on the intra - atomic coulomb effect ; without treating the @xmath1 states as a band , the coulomb interaction gives rise to too large rxms intensities .",
    "thus the @xmath1 band effect has a role of reducing the effect of the coulomb interaction .",
    "we have also a clear peak in the pre-@xmath0-edge region , which will be shown to come from the quadrupolar process .",
    "since the @xmath2 states strongly couple to the magnetic order , having this peak is not surprising .",

    "iii , the formulation of the rxms spectra is developed , and the calculated results are discussed in comparison with experiments .",
    "section v is devoted to concluding remarks . in the appendix ,",
    "the geometrical factors are given in explicit forms .",
    "for describing the @xmath2 states mixing to the @xmath13 states of neighboring o sites , we start by the following model hamiltonian : @xmath14 operators @xmath15 and @xmath16 represent the annihilation of an electron with spin @xmath17 in the @xmath2 state @xmath18 of the ni site @xmath19 and of an electron with spin @xmath17 in the @xmath13 state @xmath20 of the o site @xmath21 , respectively .",

    "the third term represents the spin - orbit interaction of the @xmath2 states .",
    "the fourth term represents the energy of the @xmath13 level of o. the relative energy is given by the charge - transfer energy @xmath29 defined by @xmath30 for the @xmath31 configuration with @xmath32 .",
    "the last term represents the mixing of the ni @xmath2 states with the o @xmath13 states .",
    "the mixing parameters @xmath33 are defined by the slater - koster integrals , @xmath34 , @xmath35.@xcite most parameter values are assumed to be consistent with a previous cluster - model analysis@xcite and our previous electron correlation calculation.@xcite they are listed in table [ tbl.param ] . we evaluate the atomic values within the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation.@xcite for @xmath26 , we use a rather smaller value than the atomic one by considering screening effects in solids , while for @xmath27 and @xmath28 we use the atomic values with multiplying a factor 0.8 .",
    "the ground state is calculated within this hamiltonian as follows .",
    "we assume that each cluster consisting of a ni atom and surrounding six o atoms is subjected to a molecular field coming from neighboring clusters ; the exchange energy in the mean - field approximation is given by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 represent the spin operator for the @xmath2 states , and @xmath38 is the fourier transform of the exchange constant with the af modulation vector @xmath7 .",
    "since the nel temperature @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 in the mean field approximation , the exchange energy is expressed as @xmath41 with the @xmath42 axis pointing to one of the directions @xmath9 , @xmath43 , or @xmath11 .",
    "we put @xmath44 , @xmath45 for ni atoms , and use the experimental value for @xmath39 .",
