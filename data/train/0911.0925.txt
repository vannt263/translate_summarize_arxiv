    "the clas  @xcite detector system in hall b at the thomas jefferson national accelerator laboratory is a multi - purpose , multi - particle spectrometer for photo- and electro - excitation of mesons and baryons .",
    "the scientific goal is to understand the spectrum of non - strange baryon excitations ( `` @xmath2 physics '' ) , including the spin structure , transition form factors , and decay modes of these states . to this end ,",
    "polarized and tagged real photon beams with energy up to 5.7 gev , and electron scattering for @xmath3 up to about 4.5 gev / c@xmath4 have been used in conjunction with proton , deuteron , and nuclear targets .",
    "the targets have been polarized longitudinally and ( in the future ) transversely to the incident beams .",
    "as is well known , the cross section for elementary production of hyperons and strange mesons is of the order of a few microbarns in the c.m .",
    "energy range from threshold at 1.6 gev to about 2.5 gev .",
    "this is a percent - level contribution to the overall production rate dominated by single and multiple pion final states . in the search for resonances",
    "predicted in quark models  @xcite but unseen in experiments  @xcite , the small contributions by strange - particle final states could be decisive .",
    "first , in the mass range of `` missing '' resonances above 1.6 gev , the production of hyperons in reactions such as @xmath5 is comparatively easy to detect and analyze .",
    "the dominant multi - pion final states are more complicated to handle theoretically and experimentally .",
    "second , the self - analyzing aspect of hyperon decays allows for the straightforward measurement of polarization observables involving the recoiling baryon , much more so than for non - strange final states where polarization measurements require a secondary scattering .",
    "in fact , there is a prospect at clas to make `` complete '' measurements of enough spin observables in the hyperon production channels that the entire amplitude structure can be determined .",
    "this has not been done yet for any elementary pseudo - scalar meson photo - production process .    on the other hand ,",
    "the smallness of the hyperon electromagnetic production cross sections relative to the non - strange channels means that channel coupling effects are significant . to understand the @xmath2 spectrum in photo- and electro - excitation requires modeling of these effects to enforce unitarity and to gain realistic estimates of the couplings for particular channels .",
    "such efforts are underway , see for examples refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite .    beside production and decay of @xmath2 and @xmath6 resonances into the ground state @xmath7 and @xmath8",
    ", clas can study the production of hyperon resonances such as @xmath9 , @xmath0 , @xmath10 , etc .",
    ", and also the @xmath1 resonances .",
    "the interest in these states is that some may turn out not to be elementary quark model states , but rather be dynamically generated objects made through the resonant re - interaction of a ground state pseudoscalar meson and an octet baryon , as discussed for example in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "most of the results shown during this conference were preliminary , but should be published in archival journals within the next months .",
    "some of the key new results are included here .",
    "elementary photoproduction of any pseudo - scalar meson , including kaon - hyperon ( `` @xmath11 '' ) production , can be described by four complex amplitudes that define the reaction completely .",
    "bilinear combinations of these amplitudes lead to 16 observables that require specification of some combination of the polarization of the incident photon , the nucleon target , and the recoiling baryon  @xcite .",
    "the differential cross section is unique in that it depends only on the sum of the amplitude magnitudes squared .",
    "the others involve various algebraic combinations of the amplitudes and of interference terms among them .",
    "the problem of finding a minimal set of measurements to totally separate the amplitude components at any given energy was solved  @xcite to show that eight of sixteen observables must be measured , but not any eight will do . beside the cross section @xmath12 ,",
    "the three single spin observables of beam asymmetry ( @xmath13 ) , target asymmetry ( @xmath14 ) , and recoil polarization ( @xmath15 ) are needed , as are four combinations of double - spin observables involving the three available spins . to date , the goal of a `` complete '' set of measurements on any elementary production reaction channel has not been achieved .",
    "however , it is the ambition of the clas program to reach this goal for the @xmath16 and @xmath17 channels within the next few years . there is similar hope that enough measurements can be made for the neutron - target channels as well , so as to pin down the isospin dependence of the reactions .",
    "one must distinguish between determination of the four reaction amplitudes and understanding the reaction mechanism of strangeness photoproduction .",
    "once the amplitudes are measured well enough , in a sense the task of the experimentalists is finished since no other information can be gleaned from any other measurements .",
    "the task of the model - builders is not done , of course .",
    "for example the @xmath2 content of the intermediate states in the @xmath18-channel leading to the @xmath11 final state remains to be parsed from the amplitudes .",
    "clas has published photoproduction cross sections for the reactions @xmath5 and @xmath19 over a broad angular range and at energies up to 2.54 gev  @xcite .",
    "there has been controversy  @xcite about a discrepancy of these measurements with those from saphir at bonn  @xcite . near @xmath20 gev ,",
    "both experiments reported a bump - like feature in the cross section that is clearly the signature of an underlying baryonic structure .",
    "it is either a resonance , with quantum numbers that are open to debate ( see for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) , or perhaps it is the signature of a @xmath21 dynamically - generated resonance  @xcite .",
    "there is good agreement between clas and leps  @xcite at forward angles .",
    "new measurements at clas have been performed using the so - called `` g11 '' data set , obtained for pentaquark searches , but which has provided copious data for other reaction channels .",
    "figure  [ fig : mccracken](a ) shows a sample of these data , showing , in one kaon production angle bin , the improved statistics and wider energy coverage compared to previous results .",
    "the agreement with the published clas results is excellent , and the discrepancy with saphir is evidently resolved in the favor of clas .",
    "obviously the new results are not total independent measurements , since they use the same clas detector , but the data set , the experimental trigger , the analysis chain , the monte carlo methods , and the people doing the analysis were all different .",
    "clas also published results for the out - of - plane hyperon recoil polarization @xmath15  @xcite that were in good agreement with those produced by saphir  @xcite and by graal  @xcite .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mccracken](b ) , the new results from clas are in excellent agreement with the earlier work , and have higher precision and broader energy coverage .",
    "it is remarkable how some `` fine structure '' is newly visible in the @xmath15 results .",
    "there is no definite interpretation yet of these structures , pending an on - going partial wave analysis project at carnegie mellon  @xcite ; the data alone will be published separately .    using coherent bremsstrahlung from a diamond radiator , linearly polarized photons",
    "were produced between 1.15 and 2.05 gev .",
    "clas has measured the beam asymmetry ( @xmath13 ) in the @xmath22  @xcite channel ( not shown ) , which is the azimuthal sine - like variation of the production intensity .",
    "results are in agreement with published data from graal  @xcite and leps  @xcite , but cover a broader energy and angular range . also using linearly polarized photons , clas",
    "has measured the beam - recoil observables for transfer of the transverse polarization of the photon to the recoiling hyperon  @xcite .",
    "this was done by detecting the parity - violating weak decay of the hyperons , measured in each bin of kaon production angle and incident beam energy .",
    "the observables are called @xmath23 and @xmath24 , corresponding to polarization transfer in the scattering plane .",
    "one can choose these axes to align either with the beam axis or the kaon - hyperon axis in the c.m .",
    "frame , since the polarization transforms like a three - vector .",
    "the preliminary results show that near threshold the @xmath7 hyperon is nearly fully polarized `` sideways '' , as one might guess naively , but the hyperon `` picks '' to be polarized pointing toward the beam - axis side of the reaction plane .",
    "no models predict this phenomenon .",
    "the incoming photons can be circularly polarized via bremsstrahlung from longitudinally polarized electrons ; in clas this electron beam polarization can be around 80% .",
    "this gives access to the beam - recoil observables representing the transfer of the photon helicity to the produced hyperon in the reaction plane .",
    "these observables are called @xmath25 and @xmath26 , again with freedom in picking the axes aligned with either the beam or the final - state particles .",
    "clas has measured these observables  @xcite , and found that for a wide range of kinematics the photon helicity is transferred very much along the beam direction , corresponding to @xmath27 . but even more unexpected was that the three components of the recoiling hyperon polarization , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath15 , when produced with circularly polarized photons , summed in magnitude to essentially unity .",
    "that is , @xmath28 over the whole of the measured angle and energy range .",
    "this has been experimentally confirmed by recent data from graal  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon was described in a semi - classical model  @xcite at the previous hyp conference . however , since then several groups have incorporated this phenomenology into various effective lagrangian models .",
    "the accumulation of recent clas , leps , graal , and saphir results for @xmath11 photoproduction has been used in several model - building studies .",
    "the `` resonance '' at 1.9 gev was initially interpreted by bennhold and mart  @xcite as a @xmath29 state in the kaon - maid model , as inspired by the search for missing resonances as specified by capstick and roberts  @xcite . in a recent updating of this model",
    ", mart finds  @xcite more consistency with assigning this structure the quantum numbers @xmath30 . in another instance , the bonn - gatchina group has shown  @xcite that , as part of their elaborate multi - channel unitary baryon excitation picture , the @xmath25 and @xmath26 results strongly favor the excitation of a @xmath30 resonance with a pole at 1915 mev .",
    "this would qualify as finding a `` missing '' quark model state .",
    "it is inconsistent with at least one quark - diquark model of baryon structure  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", there is a suggestion that this large peak in the @xmath31 cross section is not a standard baryon resonance at all , but rather a @xmath21 bound state  @xcite .    in elementary electroproduction of strangeness via the reactions @xmath32 , the unseparated electroproduction cross sections shows a bump - like structure in @xmath7 channel near 1.9 gev , just as in photoproduction  @xcite .",
    "clas published results for the transfer of longitudinal polarization of the virtual photon to the produced hyperon  @xcite .",
    "newer work shows that the phenomenon of large spin transfer along the ( virtual ) beam direction remains valid over a quite broad kinematic range , for @xmath33 up to at least 2.31 gev and @xmath3 out to 2.41 ( gev / c)@xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the helicity asymmetry in electron scattering , @xmath34 , sometimes called the `` fifth structure function '' in electron scattering from an unpolarized target , has also been recently published  @xcite , and it covers the region of the bump at 1.9 gev .",
    "the conclusion of that work was to disfavor the @xmath35 interpretation of the structure .",
    "the @xmath0 hyperon is a well - known state , but its internal structure has been problematic for five decades .",
    "while it may contain a 3-quark component , it is widely discussed as a candidate for a @xmath36 molecular state , or as a dynamically generated resonance made via meson - baryon rescattering  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : rawlambda ] is the raw hyperon spectrum seen with clas in @xmath37 when @xmath38 , where the parenthetical neutron is reconstructed by missing mass .",
    "clear signals for the low - lying hyperons are seen on top of a background .",
    "the combination of @xmath0 and @xmath9 is visible , as well as a large @xmath39 signal near 1670 mev and possible bumps near 1850 mev .",
    "clas can map out this excitation with a resolution of @xmath40 mev .",
    "the background is due to particle mis - identification , and in other decay channels the physics background from @xmath41 production .",
    "if the @xmath0 were a conventional 3-quark state of well - defined isospin , the mass distribution or `` line shape '' would be the same for charge - symmetric decays @xmath42 and @xmath43 , as well as for @xmath44 .",
    "that is , one would expect a basically breit - wigner line shape , with distortions expected due to the opening of the @xmath36 decay channel about 27 mev above the peak of the structure and small isospin - breaking mass differences .",
    "however , there is a prediction by the valencia group  @xcite that the @xmath0 is a dynamically generated resonance with contributions from two isospin amplitudes .",
    "the interference of @xmath45 and @xmath46 amplitudes will cause the @xmath47 mass distributions to differ in a specific way , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda1405](a ) . in other models ,",
    "two poles in the @xmath45 channel are discussed , one mostly coupling to @xmath48 and the other to @xmath47  @xcite ; these would also distort the bw line shape .",
    "preliminary photoproduction evidence for the plausibility of these surmises came from the leps group at spring-8  @xcite .",
    "however , that experimental result was statistically weak .",
    "another recent result from cosy at julich , looking at the @xmath0 in @xmath49 collisions through the @xmath50 decay mode , suggested that there is no apparent difference among the decay modes to different charge final states  @xcite .",
    "again , this result was weak in statistics .",
    "what is needed is a high - statistics sample of this hyperon decaying to several charge states , and this is what clas can provide . if mass distribution distortions are confirmed , this would be an example of a well - known baryon resonance shown to have a structure fundamentally outside of the usual valence quark model and its extensions .",
    "the @xmath0 photoproduction differential cross section and line shape was recently measured again by the leps collaboration  @xcite at very forward kaon angles ( @xmath51 ) and energies of @xmath52 and @xmath53 gev .",
    "their extraction of the @xmath0 differential cross section assumed a theoretical @xmath0 line shape , and their results had poor statistics .",
    "the clas detector and g11 data set allowed reconstruction of the line shape of the @xmath0 directly from the data , without relying on theoretical models , with sufficient statistics to acceptance - correct the line shape in each bin .",
    "the mass distribution and differential cross section of the @xmath0 in all of its decay channels have been extracted .",
    "a preliminary sample result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda1405](b ) .",
    "this is the @xmath0 line shape for each of its decay modes @xmath54 in units of @xmath55 for @xmath56 gev .",
    "all distributions have been acceptance corrected for detector losses and summed over all production angles .",
    "separation of various components of the line shape was achieved by fitting the total spectrum with monte carlo data  @xcite , and therewith subtracting off contributions from @xmath41 production and @xmath9 production ( scaled from its decay to the @xmath57 final state ) .",
    "results in nine @xmath33 bins that clas covered in the g11 run period are pending .    in the figure ,",
    "notice that the @xmath58 mass distribution starts well above the threshold , and has the most narrow peak at the highest mass .",
    "the @xmath59 distribution has the broadest structure , while the @xmath60 distribution comes in between the charged @xmath61 line shapes .",
    "this is in contrast to the theory of  @xcite , where it is the @xmath59 line shape that is predicted to be the one with the highest mass at its peak and the most narrow structure .",
    "nevertheless , it is notable how the theory captures at least the qualitative aspects of the isospin - induced modifications of the production line shape .",
    "detailed systematic studies are in progress to finalize these spectra",
    ". since the effects are quite strong in the data , the next step will be to estimate the contributions from the @xmath45 and @xmath46 components of the reaction .",
    "the parity of the @xmath0 has not been measured before and the spin needs confirmation , though no one would be very surprised if the answer were @xmath62 , as predicted by the quark model .",
    "the clas data allows a direct measurement of the spin and parity , leading to the expected result .",
    "some additional details of these measurements are given in ref .",
    "clas can measure photoproduction of other @xmath63 excited hyperons .",
    "some results awaiting archival publication include data for the @xmath10 and @xmath9 .",
    "the main motivation for such studies at this point is to fill in the very scanty database of information for these reactions .",
    "electroproduction of the @xmath10 has been reported  @xcite , showing that in the @xmath64-channel the exchanged mesons are a mixture of spin 0 and spin 1 , unlike in photoproduction , where the exchange is dominantly spin 1 .",
    "photoproduction of the @xmath65 in the reaction @xmath66 has been reported  @xcite and compared with some success to a simple effective lagrangian model .",
    "the @xmath67 hyperons have received attention since they can be detected in clas through reactions of the type @xmath68 or @xmath69 . in quark models",
    ", the @xmath1 resonances should be as numerous as the @xmath2 states .",
    "they are small in production cross section , but have the good feature that they are expected to be fairly narrow ; for example , the first excited state , the @xmath70 , has been seen in photoproduction , and its roughly 9 mev width is to be contrasted with the @xmath71 mev width of any @xmath2 state .",
    "clas has reported  @xcite photoproduction of @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "fair agreement was found between the measured ground state cross section and an effective lagrangian model  @xcite based on the notion of @xmath64-channel excitation of high - mass @xmath63 states decaying to the ground state @xmath67 @xmath1 hyperon .",
    "finding `` new '' high mass @xmath67 states is the goal of on - going analysis of a clas data set with a 5.7 gev endpoint , as well as eventual new experiments in the 12 gev era at jefferson lab .",
    "small but statistically insignificant hints of higher mass @xmath1 s in the published data  @xcite are tantalizing .",
    "there are three categories of measurements still in the `` pipeline '' at clas that will lead to additional hyperon - related results .",
    "first , with a deuteron target one can access the elementary production cross sections off the neutron , and a large data set ( `` g13 '' ) was accumulated in 2006 with circularly polarized photons up to 2.6 gev , and in 2007 with linearly polarized photons up to 2.3 gev .",
    "it is expected that processes such as @xmath75 or @xmath76 will be accessible , where @xmath77 designates the spectator proton .",
    "information from the other isospin channels in elementary photoproduction is naturally of interest to gain the complete understanding of these reactions .",
    "quasi - free reactions on the proton can also be observed .",
    "second , the clas frozen spin butanol target , frost , was operated successfully with longitudinal polarization in 2007 , and processing of this data is well along . @xmath31",
    "spin observables such as @xmath78 and @xmath14 are being determined . using the holding field of a `` saddle coil ''",
    ", it is planned to run with transversely polarized butanol in the spring and summer of 2010 , so that the dream of a `` complete '' set of spin observables for @xmath11 photoproduction will be achievable .",
    "finally , the remaining goal at clas is to have a polarized neutron target to measure the corresponding spin observables . a target system called `` hd - ice '' is under development which pumps molecular hd material such as to selectively polarize just the deuterium or just the hydrogen .",
    "this system is planned to run in clas late in 2010 and the first part of 2011 .",
    "this brief overview of recent strangeness physics results from jefferson lab s clas facility should illustrate the variety of issues being addressed .",
    "improved precision of several hyperon photo- and electro - production observables is making the modeling of the @xmath31 and @xmath79 channels more exact and conclusive .",
    "this is relevant to the search for non - strange quark - model baryon resonances missing in the experimental record .",
    "the dream of measuring enough observables to construct the complete set of amplitude - level components of these channels is within reach , using existing and upcoming data using polarized targets ( frost , hd - ice ) , polarized photon beams ( both circular and linear ) , and detecting the recoil hyperon polarization .",
    "the @xmath0 was shown , in preliminary results , to have significant isospin - mixing effects in its decay to @xmath47 , which is relevant to the study of the pole structure on the @xmath63 meson - baryon system near threshold .",
    "the lightest @xmath1 hyperons have been detected and measured in photoproduction , and work is in progress to look for other @xmath67 states with higher mass using data sets obtained with beam energies approaching 6 gev .    between 2009 and the end of the 6 gev era at clas in late 2011",
    ", more data sets will be acquired using transverse proton target polarization and also polarized neutron ( deuterium ) targets .",
    "thus , it is likely that clas will be able to present additional results on the production and decay of @xmath11 systems into the middle of the coming decade .",
