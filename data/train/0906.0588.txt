    "when the fast , low - density gas of molecular outflows or jets expand into the surrouding molecular cloud , large cavities may result ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "along these outflow cavities , fuv radiation may escape and irradiate the high density material at the border of the cavity .",

    "the network consists of different types of chemical reactions . in dark clouds for example ,",
    "all fuv radiation is shielded by a large column density of dust and the chemistry is dominated by cosmic ray ionization and reactions between neutral and ionized species ( e.g. @xcite ) . in the innermost part of a yso envelope ,",

    "so far , a spherically symmetric structure of the envelope has been assumed for chemical models of envelopes of high - mass star forming regions ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "while the abundances derived using this spherical model agree for many species with observations of specific sources , they fail to explain the amount of co@xmath0 . due to the attenuation by dust , fuv radiation can not escape the innermost few hundred au and the volume of gas where co@xmath0  may be formed is too small in spherical models to reproduce the observations .",
    "another possible formation mechanism of co@xmath0  is x - ray irradiation . unlike fuv photons ,",
    "x - rays are mainly attenuated by geometrical dilution ( @xmath5 ) due to their smaller absorption cross - section proportional to @xmath6 .",
    "x - ray radiation can thus penetrate much deeper into the envelope on scales of a few thousand au .",
    "protostellar x - ray luminosities of up to @xmath7 erg s@xmath8 in the 1 - 100 kev band are observed ( @xcite ) . for this luminosity",

    "compact emission of hco@xmath0  associated with the outflow wall has been detected by @xcite in the class 0 object l 1527 .",
    "a possible explanation is mixing of partially ionized gas from the outflow with infalling material leading to a thin layer of dense and ionized gas , where species with a high dipole moment ( e.g. hco@xmath0  or hcn ) can be excitet efficiently by collisions with electrons ( @xcite ) .",
    "detailed 3d radiative transfer studies by @xcite on the other hand prefer a scenario with an enhanced abundance of hco@xmath0  due to shock liberation and photoprocessing of molecular material stored in ice mantles .",
    "observational evidence for such an interaction layer in a high - mass star forming region are found by @xcite by studying the line profiles of different molecular species .",
    "recently , @xcite find evidence for uv photons escaping through the outflow cones and impacting the walls for the low - mass protostar hh 46 .",
    "+ in this work , we will introduce a chemical model that implements a non - spherical density structure taking an outflow cavity into account .",
    "a proper treatment of the fuv irradiated outflow walls requires two - dimensional chemical models with high spatial resolution .",

    "<S> observations of the high - mass star forming region afgl 2591 reveal a large abundance of co@xmath0 , a molecule known to be enhanced by far uv ( fuv ) and x - ray irradiation . in chemical models assuming a spherically symmetric envelope , the volume of gas irradiated by protostellar fuv radiation is very small due to the high extinction by dust . </S>",
    "<S> the abundance of co@xmath0  is thus underpredicted by orders of magnitude . in a more realistic model </S>",
    "<S> , fuv photons can escape through an outflow region and irradiate gas at the border to the envelope . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we introduce the first 2d axi - symmetric chemical model of the envelope of a high - mass star forming region to explain the co@xmath0  observations as a prototypical fuv tracer . </S>",
    "<S> the model assumes an axi - symmetric power - law density structure with a cavity due to the outflow . </S>",
    "<S> the local fuv flux is calculated by a monte carlo radiative transfer code taking scattering on dust into account . </S>",
    "<S> a grid of precalculated chemical abundances , introduced in the first part of this series of papers , is used to quickly interpolate chemical abundances . </S>",
    "<S> this approach allows to calculate the temperature structure of the fuv heated outflow walls self - consistently with the chemistry . + synthetic maps of the line flux are calculated using a raytracer code . </S>",
    "<S> single - dish and interferometric observations are simulated and the model results are compared to published and new jcmt and sma observations . </S>",
    "<S> the two - dimensional model of afgl 2591 is able to reproduce the jcmt single - dish observations and also explains the non - detection by the sma . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the observed co@xmath0  line flux and its narrow width can be interpreted by emission from the warm and dense outflow walls irradiated by protostellar fuv radiation . </S>"
