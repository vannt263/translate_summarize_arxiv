    "@xmath13 given as the solution of @xmath14 then there is the inequality @xmath15 the regions where @xmath0 is small will be of particular interest because an eigenfunction @xmath9 can only localize in @xmath16 .",
    "the landscape function turns out to be more effective than that : it is instructive to regard the graph of @xmath17 as a landscape comprised of peaks and valleys ; the valleys may then be understood as inducing a partition of the domain .",
    "numerical experiments @xcite suggest that low - lying eigenfunctions respect that partition and favor localization in one or at most a few elements in that partition .",
    "moreover , these localized eigenfunctions are almost compactly supported in the sense that in crossing from one element of the partition to another eigenfunctions seem to experience exponential decay when crossing the valley ( see @xcite ) .      concerning this exponential drop in size of an eigenfunction when crossing valley , this was recently made precise by arnold , david , jerison , mayboroda & filoche @xcite who point out that the inverse of the landscape function @xmath18 acts as an effective potential responsible for the exponential decay of the localized states ( the connection being that @xmath17 is small in valleys , which makes @xmath18 large and large potentials induce large decay ) .",
    "their approach is based on writing an eigenfunction as @xmath19 for some unknown function @xmath20 .",

    "the paper @xcite also gives convincing numerical evidence that @xmath30 seems to predict decay more accurately than the classical quantity @xmath31 .",
    "this might seem surprising because clearly @xmath32 determines the behavior of the eigenfunctions .",
    "the purpose of our paper is to further clarify these observations and the interplay between an eigenfunction doubling its size in a small ball and the landscape function ; the main tool is an identity following from the feynman - kac formula .",

    "the most prominent role of the torsion function in the field of shape optimization ( see e.g. @xcite ) is that @xmath38 gives the expected lifetime of brownian motion started in @xmath7 until it hits the boundary .",
    "this suggests to interpret the landscape function in that language ; the idea of using brownian motion to analyze decay properties of eigenfunctions is classical and was very successfully used in seminal papers by carmona @xcite , carmona & simon @xcite , carmona , masters & simon @xcite , simon @xcite and others ; recently , a similar technique was used by the author @xcite to obtain bounds on the size of nodal sets of laplacian eigenfunctions @xmath39 on compact manifolds .",
    "the crucial ingredient is a simple equation representing an eigenfunction @xmath5 as a localized average over local brownian motion paths running for a short time .",
    "this equation is not new and has been used earlier for very similar purposes , see e.g. carmona & simon @xcite .",
    "this equation is obtained by looking at the effect of the semigroup @xmath40 on the eigenfunction .",
    "since eigenfunctions diagonalize the semigroup , we have that if @xmath41 at the same time , there is another interpretation of the action of the semigroup in terms of brownian motion .",
    "the _ feynman - kac formula _ states that for an arbitrary function @xmath42 @xmath43 where the expectation @xmath44 is taken with respect to brownian motion @xmath6 started in @xmath7 , running for time @xmath45 and destroyed upon impact on the boundary . combining these two equations , we get @xmath46    this equation describes a complicated relationship between @xmath5 , @xmath47 and @xmath32 , however , it is perfectly suited for establishing a variation estimate in a small ball : assuming the eigenfunction @xmath9 to be essentially constant on a small scale allows us to move the eigenfunction @xmath9 out of the expectation at the cost of a very small error .",

    "the purpose of this section is to suggest a cheap way of creating computationally feasible improvements . the original proofs @xcite demonstrating @xmath144 use green s functions .",

    "clearly , that simple argument could also be iterated and , by the same token , @xmath152 like the original landscape function , these improvements can only be effective for @xmath47 small : for @xmath47 large , we will have @xmath153 everywhere except for small regions close to the boundary and thus @xmath154 and the argument will merely recreate @xmath0 .",
    "the main idea has already been outlined above .",

    "are contained within a ball of radius @xmath80 ( suggesting to set @xmath156 ) .",
    "however , some brownian motion paths will actually leave that ball and may give a large additional contribution but the likelihood of that happening is small . using the standard reflection principle implies for one - dimensional brownian motion @xmath157",
    "that @xmath158 this implies that the likelihood of a brownian motion leaving a ball of fixed radius for some time @xmath159 can be bounded by the likelihood of having left the ball at time @xmath45 .",
    "more precisely , the standard gaussian heat kernel estimate yields for some universal constants @xmath160 ( depending only on the dimension ) and fixed @xmath161 @xmath162 this holds at a much greater level of generality @xcite .",
    "the proof consists of showing that all the quantities work together as described by doing the algebra .",
    "we assume that @xmath163 with @xmath164 where @xmath165 is some constant we are allowed to choose depending on @xmath166 .",
    "we start with assuming that @xmath167 the case @xmath168 is similar and will be described afterwards . we can assume without loss of generality that @xmath49 .",
    "the time scale of the argument will be @xmath169 . for a",
    "brownian motion @xmath170 started in @xmath51 we distinguish two cases :      case 1 is very easy to deal with : in that case , we can easily bound any single path fully via @xmath173 and the same argument holds in expectation for all paths conditioned on case 1 .",
    "it remains to consider case 2 .",
    "if it occurs , then we only have the trivial bound ( using @xmath67 ) @xmath174 which is large but the likelihood of that event is small . combining this with the upper bound on the likelihood of case 2 gives @xmath175 we derive a contradiction by setting @xmath176 , which gives @xmath177 simple algebra allows us to reformulate the inequality as @xmath178 where @xmath179 can be made arbitrarily small by making @xmath165 sufficiently large ( depending only on @xmath166 ) .",
    "this gives a contradiction since @xmath180 and concludes the first case .",
    "the other statement to consider is @xmath181 here , essentially all signs are reversed and we show that there is too much local growth",
    ". we can again distinguish case 1 and case 2 and get for case 1 that @xmath182 the second case is again completely without control and we can only use the trivial estimate @xmath183 altogether , this yields @xmath184 for @xmath165 sufficiently large , we can ensure that @xmath185 .",
    "thus , for @xmath165 sufficiently large @xmath186 plugging things in as before yields ( using again @xmath176 and therefore same value of @xmath187 as before ) @xmath188 where by the same computation as above @xmath189 can be made bigger than 2 by choosing @xmath165 sufficiently large and @xmath179 can be made arbitrarily small by making @xmath165 sufficiently large .      the proof used uses the identity for all @xmath190 to introduce an infimum .",
    "@xmath191 by assumption @xmath9 is dominated by a landscape function @xmath128 and thus @xmath192 this concludes the argument .      since brownian motion",
    "is isotropic , the proof of the variation estimate can cover a stronger result : simply put , the variation estimate is true because of of the graph .",
    "more generally , we can show that if @xmath193 is another function satisfying @xmath194 .",
    "@xmath195 for the value of @xmath45 for which we wish to apply the variation estimate , then the function @xmath196 the best example is perhaps given by @xmath72 ( eigenfunctions of the laplace operator @xmath197 ) and @xmath128 being the best linear approximation of @xmath9 in @xmath51 @xmath198 this function is essentially invariant under heat flow for @xmath199 ( with a negligible contribution from @xmath200 that can be made precise ) .",
    "the variation estimate implies that @xmath201 doubles its size and since we have removed the tangent plane this implies that @xmath201 ca nt be too small because there is curvature in the graph .",
    "this also explains why the variation estimate does not apply when @xmath202 : then the functions have no guaranteed curvature @xmath203 and the doubling in size , if present at all , could possible vanish once an affine function is removed .",
