    "extragalactic radio sources are often associated with massive elliptical galaxies . these so called radio galaxies are one of the most extraordinary astrophysical phenomena , powered , it is generally believed , by supermassive black holes in the galaxy nuclei .",
    "radio galaxies are found in a variety of environments and across a wide range of redshifts .",
    "the revised third cambridge catalogue ( 3cr ) ( bennett 1962a , 1962b ) is the best studied sample of radio loud galaxies and quasars .",
    "spinrad et al .",
    "( 1985 ) confirmed 298 extragalactic radio sources of the 3cr catalogue .",
    "this catalogue was made based on the radio properties of the sources , and therefore its selection criteria are mostly independent with respect to orientation and hst wavelengths .",
    "the 3cr catalogue has , thus , excellent attributes for a survey .    here",
    "we describe all the observations taken with our snapshot program in the hst cycle 13 .",
    "we are using nicmos to obtain high spatial resolution , deep images in the near infrared @xmath0-band of 3cr sources at low redshift , @xmath1 .",
    "the primary goal of this project is to characterize the radio galaxy hosts free from the obscuring effects of dust , or at least , substantially reduced relative to the optical and uv . we also want to establish how radio galaxy hosts compare to the hosts of the most powerful high - z agn , to qso , and to quiescent ellipticals .",
    "the high linear resolution of hst grants us the possibility to observe details of the galaxies such as point - like nuclei , jets , and hot spots .",
    "these near - infrared observations are aimed at providing a zero redshift comparison sample for observations at high redshift .",
    "this nicmos snapshot program is a major enhancement to the dataset of hst observations of the 3cr sources .",
    "successful snapshot programs have been carried out during past cycles in the optical and in the ultraviolet by sparks and collaborators .",
    "the wfpc2 observations were presented by martel et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for @xmath2 , by de koff et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for @xmath3 , and by mccarthy et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for @xmath4 .",
    "uv observations with stis were published by allen et al .",
    "these successive hst programs have generated a database with a sample completeness comparable , for some range of redshift , to the radio catalogue .",
    "this database provides an excellent foundation for statistical studies as a vast number of observations of these sources are available for comparison at other wavelengths and with other instruments .",
    "the content of this paper is as follows : section 2 describes the observation strategy , section 3 discusses the different steps of the data reduction , section 4 highlights results obtained from this survey and gives near - infrared photometry , section 5 presents three galaxies with jets visible with galaxy subtraction , in section 6 we make comments on the image of each individual galaxy .",
    "we use throughout this paper h@xmath5=71 km.s@xmath6mpc@xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "there is a total of 115 objects in the 3cr catalogue with @xmath1 , 18 of them have been observed with nicmos during previous cycles as part of other hst programs .",
    "we present 69 sources that have never been observed before , this corresponds to 71@xmath9 of the sample .",
    "these new observations are associated with program 10173 , pi : sparks .",
    "this nicmos survey uses snapshot exposures , a capability developed by the stsci to maximize the observing efficiency of hst .",
    "the observations obtained during this survey are taken at irregular intervals that fill the scheduling gaps between other accepted go programs .",
    "the remaining 28 sources were not scheduled for observation during cycle 13 .",
    "the observation log is presented in table 1 . since the observed targets are randomly chosen based on the constraints of the observing schedule of hst , the 69 galaxies we present here are not biased towards any particular characteristic .",
    "thus , they are suitable for statistical analysis .    the radio properties of the observed sample are given in table 2 .",
    "we present the flux density and radio power at 178 mhz , the radio spectral index , largest angular size , position angle , and fanaroff and riley ( 1974 ) morphological classification .",
    "the sources are representative of large , steep spectrum , high power radio sources .",
    "the sources span three decades in radio power from log@xmath10 25 to 28 .",
    "the edge - darkened , lower luminosity fri sources make up 26% of the sample .    all the observations presented here were carried out with nicmos camera 2 ( nic2 ) on multiaccum observing mode .",
    "we use the multiaccum sequence step32 , which consists of rapid reads up to 32 seconds followed by 32 second steps .",
    "nic2 has a field of view of @xmath11 and a projected pixel size of @xmath12 .",
    "the measured fwhm for a bright source is 0.14 .",
    "the field size allows us to detect both the host galaxy and nuclear regions at the redshifts we aim .",
    "the cooresponding physical scale over our redshift range varies from 0.335 kpc / arcsecond to 4.376 kpc / arcsecond .",
    "we use the f160w filter , the analog of the @xmath0 band .",
    "this filter is centered at 1.6037@xmath13 m , covering a wavelength range from 1.4@xmath13 m to 1.8@xmath13 m , and includes the paschen @xmath14 emission line for objects at @xmath2 . for further details the reader",
    "is referred to the nicmos instrument handbook ( noll et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "all images have the same total exposure time of 1152 seconds , split into four exposures of 288s .",
    "we perform sub - pixel dithering to improve the psf sampling and remove bad pixels .",
    "we use a squared dither pattern , with 7.4 pixels offsets .",
    "we obtain the data from the multimission archive at space telescope ( mast ) .",
    "the data are processed by the standard `` on - the - fly '' reprocessing calibration pipeline .",
    "the pipeline separates the data into science and engineering data , creates fits files and populates its headers .",
    "the pipeline also calibrates the raw data using calnica ( noll et al . 2004 ) .",
    "we do the subsequent reduction of the data with the noao image processing software image reduction analysis facility ( iraf ) .",
    "the most important anomalies that we encounter in nic2 images are : the pedestal effect , the amplifier glow , the coronographic spot , cosmic rays and bad pixels . in this section",
    "we describe the steps we follow to get rid of these anomalies on the nicmos images using different iraf tasks .",
    "nic2 is divided into four quadrants of @xmath15 pixels each . on visual inspection",
    "the raw images appear to have one quadrant darker than the others .",
    "this is particularly apparent for images with low background , e.g. small galaxies .",
    "this is known as the pedestal effect and is part of the instrumental signature for nicmos .",
    "the origin of this effect is an additional offset introduced during the detector reset .",
    "the pedestal effect is stochastic and time variable , which makes it impossible to remove with the standard pipeline offered by the stsci ( noll et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "we remove the pedestal effect with the tasks pedsky or pedsub from the nicmos package under the hst calibration of the space telescope science data analysis system ( stsdas ) .",
    "these two tasks determine the pedestal offset of each quadrant with a similar technique .",
    "both pedsky and pedsub assume that the image pixel value is the sum of the astronomical signal ( source + sky ) , and the pedestal effect modulated by the flatfield .",
    "these tasks use the flatfield as input and loop over a range of trial values for the pedestal and find the best fit to the science image , for greater details see bushouse et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "pedsky does the fit of the pedestal only with those pixels near the background level .",
    "this task dismisses pixels containing signal from a source during the fitting process .",
    "pedsky removes the pedestal effect and also subtracts the sky background .",
    "we use pedsky for galaxies that cover only a small fraction of the detector .",
    "this task is more effective when a large area of the image is free from sources in order to allow a better estimate of the background .    for sources covering a large portion of the detector we use the task pedsub to remove the pedestal effect .",
    "pedsub has a series of filters to remove unwanted features such as large galaxies .",
    "contrary to pedsky , pedsub does not remove the background . in the case where the background is not removed , we use msky2 , a task written by mark dickinson ( private communication ) , that can fit the sky interactively , and subtract the sky mode from each image to obtain a zero level background .    given the small projected size of the detector , a few galaxies cover the whole chip , for these images we adopt the median background of the other frames as the sky level .",
    "this is determined by measuring the sky level on 152 single exposures of the dither pattern . in these 152 exposures",
    "the source covers only a small fraction of the field of view .",
    "we find a median background of 0.046 counts per pixel with a standard deviation of 0.01806 .",
    "for the galaxies covering most of the detector , the subtracted sky level amounts , on average , to 1.3% of the flux inside an aperture of 1kpc radius .",
    "some images have visible noise in the corners due to the amplifier glow of nic2 .",
    "this glow is caused by the readout amplifier situated close to each corner of the detector .",
    "each time the detector is read out the amplifier warms up and emits infrared radiation that is detected by the chip ( noll et al .",
    "this anomaly does not affect the overall appearance of the image .    in order to obtain images of a better quality",
    "we create individual masks for each object to cover the small blemishes of the detector such as residual cosmic rays and bad pixels .",
    "furthermore , nic2 has a hole through the camera to allow coronographic observations , which creates a circular spot on the images of about ten pixels in diameter .",
    "we treat this area with a mask to conceal the coronographic spot .",
    "we also create cosmic rays masks , with the task drizzle@xmath16cr , that we incorporate into the individual masks for each object .",
    "the pixels of column 128 in nic2 contains the first pixels read out in each quadrant and have an incorrect bias subtracted from them .",
    "this is called the `` photometrically challenged '' column .",
    "we applied a bad pixel mask to the pixels of this column .",
    "we recover , thus , information on the image .",
    "the second extension of the nicmos fits files contains the error image .",
    "we convert these error files into weightings which are the inverse square of the noise per pixel .",
    "the mask files are multiplied into the weight files described above , giving zero weight to bad pixels in the individual files but leaving the others unchanged .",
    "we combine the four calibrated , background subtracted images of the dither pattern with the task drizzle under the package dither ( fruchter & hook 2002 ) .",
    "the final weight files are called when dithering the four exposures of each object . the projected pixel size in the final image",
    "is @xmath17 .",
    "drizzle is also used to apply the necessary rotations to the images to obtain a north up , east left orientation .",
    "these final images are presented in figures 1 - 77 .",
    "the high spatial resolution provided by hst allows us to obtain images of the 3cr radio galaxies with unprecedented details .",
    "all galaxies imaged during this program are ellipticals but each of them has its own peculiar characteristics and environment . in our sample of 69 galaxies 36 of them ( 52@xmath9 ) have companions present in the field of view of nic2 .",
    "more than one third of this sample , i.e. 25 galaxies , have an unresolved nucleus and nine galaxies have dust lanes .",
    "nineteen galaxies , primarily the closest , show off nuclear point - like sources likely to be globular clusters .",
    "four galaxies have intriguing arc - like structures , which are perhaps lensed arcs or merger remnants .",
    "we use the iraf task radprof to measure the flux of the galaxies at five different radii .",
    "the radii of the apertures we use correspond to : 1 kpc , 5 kpc , 10 kpc , 15 kpc , 20 kpc .",
    "given the small size of the detector we can not always measure the flux at all five different radii .",
    "the count rate ( cr ) is converted into flux using photflam , the inverse sensitivity , in the header of the calibrated nicmos images :    photflam=1.74779.10@xmath18 erg @xmath19 dn@xmath6    we determine the magnitudes in the space telescope ( st ) system with the expression :    m@xmath20 = - 2.5log(photflam @xmath21 cr ) + photzpt    where photzpt is the st magnitude zero point i.e. -21.1 , see the hst data handbook for nicmos ( dickinson et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the limiting magnitude for the images presented here is about 25.3 .",
    "we present the results of the near - infrared photometry in table 3 .",
    "note that these magnitudes correspond to the total observed flux inside the radii set above .",
    "we did not perform photometry for the nuclei , which will be analyzed in detail in a forthcoming paper ( chiaberge et al . in preparation )",
    "we have used the ellipse task in iraf stsdas.analysis.isophote , based on the algorithm of jedrzejewski ( 1987 ) , to fit elliptical isophotes to the nicmos images .",
    "each isophote is fitted at a pre - defined , fixed semi - major axis length . starting from a first guess , the image is sampled along an elliptical path ( defined by central coordinates @xmath22 , position angle @xmath23 , and ellipticity @xmath24 ) to produce a 1-dimensional intensity distribution as a function of @xmath23 .",
    "modeling with ellipse allows us to track radial changes in the ellipticity and position angle of the isophotes of galaxies .",
    "models based on the best - fitting ellipse parameters are constructed in iraf using the task bmodel .",
    "a complete sample of model - subtracted residual images of this survey will be presented by floyd et al .",
    "( in preparation ) . here",
    "we show two examples where jets are clearly visible with galaxy subtraction .",
    "this is the case for 3c66b , 3c133 figures 10,23 .",
