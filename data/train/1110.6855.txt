    "the whipple 10 m telescope is an imaging atmospheric cherenkov technique ( iact ) instrument , located in southern arizona , that operates in the 300 gev to 10 tev energy range .",
    "this instrument has been in operation since 1968 and was the first ground - based @xmath0-ray telescope to detect a galactic source , the crab nebula in 1989 @xcite , and an extragalactic source , markarian 421 in 1992 @xcite .",
    "currently the telescope is operated by the veritas ( very energetic radiation imaging telescope array system ) collaboration as a dedicated blazar monitoring instrument , and is used as a trigger for veritas in case of enhanced activity from any of the blazars being monitored .",
    "+ the whipple 10 m telescope blazar monitoring campaign has been in operation since 1996 , the scientific goals of the campaign are to examine the long and short - term variability of the emission from a selection of blazars .",
    "an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) is a galaxy for which the emission from its galactic core dwarfs that of the normal stellar component of the host galaxy .",
    "the galactic cores are believed to be powered by supermassive black holes surrounded by an accretion disk powering two jets of particles and electromagnetic radiation emitted perpendicular to the disk .",
    "blazars are a sub - class of agns whose jet is at an observing angle of less than 10 degrees , making it the most obvious feature of the galaxy .",
    "blazars exhibit broadband non - thermal variable emission with the presence of two peaks , one in the optical - kev range the other in the mev - tev range .",
    "+ emission models can generally be divided into two groups , where the particle species responsible for the @xmath0-ray emission are either predominately leptonic or hadronic .",
    "both model families attribute the low - energy peak to synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons within the jets .",
    "they differ on the origin of the mev - tev peak : leptonic models advocate the inverse - compton scattering mechanism , utilising synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc ) interactions or compton interactions with an external photon field ( e.g.  see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "hadronic models account for the high - energy peak by neutral - pion or charged - pion decay with subsequent synchrotron and/or compton emission from decay products , or synchrotron radiation from ultra relativistic protons ( e.g.  see @xcite , @xcite ) +",
    "long - term monitoring is needed to record both the long - term and short - term variability in the emission from blazars",
    ". periods of intense , short - term variability are known as flares .",
    "these flares occur so rarely that a large amount of observing time must be dedicated to a handful of sources in order to increase the likelihood of seeing flaring activity .",
    "+ short - term variability is crucial to the calculation of the size of the photon emission region .",
    "the rise / fall time during a significant change in flux with temporal width @xmath1 provides an upper limit on the size of the emitting source given by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the size of the emitting region and @xmath4 is the speed of light .",
    "@xmath5 is the doppler factor , generally on the order of 10 - 30 .",
    "long - term monitoring is also needed in order to trigger multiwavelength ( mwl ) campaigns . when a source enters a flaring period veritas",
    "is alerted , along with a numerous mwl partners , to a target of opportunity ( too ) .",
    "broadband observations of correlated variability are critical for testing the predictions of different theoretical models . +",
    "from april 2010 to october 2011 5 sources were monitored , with a total of 218 hours of data collected .",
    "see table 1 for each sources positional information , number of hours spent on source and significance level achieved .",
    "+ the observations reported here were taken at an energy @xmath6 400 gev , the integral crab flux above 400 gev is ( 8.412+/-1.804@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "lightcurves presented in this work are displayed in fluxes .",
    "these fluxes are calculated by normalising individual source rates to crab units , where one crab is equivalent to 1.25 @xmath8/min for the 10 m telescope .",
    "+ these data will form part of a multi - year data set on markarian 421 and markarian 501 .",
    "the whipple 10 m telescope s extensive coverage of these two sources at tev energies is unique .",
