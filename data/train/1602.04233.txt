    "hawking s semiclassical study @xcite on bhs showed that bhs emit particles from their `` edge '' , known as the event horizon .",
    "this phenomenon is known as hawking radiation ( hr ) , named after hawking .",
    "in fact , hr arises from the steady conversion of quantum vacuum fluctuations around into the pairs of particles , one of which escaping at spatial infinity ( si ) while the other is trapped inside the event horizon . calculations of hr reveal a characteristic blackbody spectrum .",
    "thus , putting quantum mechanics and general relativity into the process , bhs become no longer `` black '' but obey the laws of thermodynamics .",
    "however , the spacetime geometry around bh modifies hr by the so - called gfs .",
    "namely , an observer at si detects not a perfect black body spectrum but a modification of this since gfs are dependent upon both geometry and frequency maldacena .",
    "the first papers of gfs ( and its related subjects : acs and dr ) date back to the nineteen - seventies @xcite . today ,",
    "although there exists numerous studies on the subject ( see for example harmark , chern , pappas and references therein ) , the number of studies regarding rotating bhs is very limited @xcite .",
    "even there have been very few studies devoted to the naf rotating bhs doukas , meryem3,li13 .",
    "this scarcity comes from the technical difficulty of getting exact analytical solution ( eas ) to the considered wave equation .",
    "in fact , eas method ( see for example @xcite ) applies to bh geometries which depend on a radial coordinate .    in this paper",
    ", we study gf , acs , and dr of the rldbh in 4-dimensions , which is a solution to emda theory @xcite . to this end",
    ", we consider the massless scalar particle and mainly follow the studies of fern , myung , sakalli15 for using eas method .",
    "it is worth noting that the gf problem ( without considering the problem of acs and dr ) of the rldbh was firstly considered ( in broad strokes ) in @xcite .",
    "however , as being stated in the last paragraph of the conclusion of @xcite , the detailed analysis of gf problem of rldbh is not completed , and hence it deserves more deeper research .",
    "such an extension is one of the goals of the present paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 introduces rldbh geometry , and analyzes the klein - gordon equation ( kge ) in this geometry .",
    "the angular solution of the wave equation is given in sect .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the radial solution .",
    "gf , acs , and dr computations are considered in sect .",
    "5 . the paper ends with a conclusion in sect . 6 .",
    "in the boyer  lindquist coordinates , the metric of rldbh which is the stationary axisymmetric emda bh @xcite is given by    @xmath0 ,   \\label{1}\\ ] ]    with the metric function    @xmath1    where @xmath2 in which @xmath3 is a positive constant .",
    "in fact , @xmath3 is related to the background electric charge and finely tunes the dilaton and axion @xcite fields , which are associated with the dark matter @xcite . besides    @xmath4    where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the outer ( event ) and inner ( cauchy ) horizons , respectively , given by the zeros of @xmath7 :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is associated with the quasilocal mass ( @xmath10 ) via @xmath11 @xcite , and @xmath12 denotes the rotation parameter , which also tunes the both dilaton and axion fields @xcite .",
    "one can immediately see from eq .",
    "( 4 ) that having a bh is conditional on @xmath13 .",
    "otherwise , there is no horizon and the spacetime corresponds to a bh with a naked singularity at @xmath14 .",
    "the angular momentum ( @xmath15 ) and @xmath12 are related in the following way : @xmath16 .",
    "when @xmath12 vanishes , rldbh reduces to its static form , the so - called linear dilaton black hole ( ldbh ) metric . for studies of ldbh ,",

    "in order to have the general solution to eq . ( 10 ) , we introduce a new dimensionless variable as follows    @xmath38    so that eq . ( 11 ) becomes    @xmath39 \\theta = 0 .",
