    "that is , any sequence of elementary moves which includes the uses of either horizontal or vertical simplification will be _ monotonic simplification_.    one would hope that for a closed @xmath0-braid @xmath2 which admits , respectively , a destabilization , exchange moves , or elementary flype , there exists a sequence of elementary moves to the arc presentation @xmath79 ( coming from @xmath135 ) such that for the resulted arc presentation @xmath136 , the closed @xmath0-braid @xmath40 coming from @xmath137 admits , respectively , a destabilization , exchange move or elementary flype ( as seen from the standard projection @xmath41 ) .",
    "unfortunately , this is too good to be true . in order to produce a @xmath40 that admits the assumed isotopy it may be necessary to increase the number of arcs in the arc presentation . at first glance this seems to disturb our ability to maintain the characteristic of monotonic simplification .",
    "however , it is possible to control the manner in which we introduce additional arcs in the arc presentation to maintain monotonic simplification using an altered complexity measure .",
    "in particular , we have the following move for introducing additional arcs in an arc presentation .",

    "we allow shearing on any or all of the horizontal arcs of @xmath79 whose angular support intersects the intervals of @xmath139 .    given a horizontal shear @xmath138 of @xmath79 let @xmath143 be the number of horizontal arcs of @xmath138 whose angular support does not intersect @xmath139 .",
    "let @xmath144 be the number of point of intersection between horizontal arcs and @xmath145 .",

    "the reader should notice that @xmath147 .",
    "( we will abuse notation using @xmath148 for both complexities .",
    "thus , the reader is required to refer to the context in determining which complexity is being referenced . )    since the complexity measure for @xmath138 does not measure the total number of arcs of @xmath138 we can treat @xmath138 as the equivalence class of all presentations coming from the alteration depicted in figure [ figure : shear ] . for our purposes we will allow @xmath139 to be : a single interval @xmath149\\}$ ] when we are discussing whether @xmath2 admits a destabilization ; two disjoint intervals @xmath150 , [ \\theta_2,\\theta_2 + \\e_2 ] \\}$ ] when we are discussing whether @xmath2 admits an exchange move ; and three disjoint intervals @xmath150 , [ \\theta_2,\\theta_2 + \\e_2 ] , [ \\theta_3,\\theta_3 + \\e_3 ] \\}$ ] when we are discussing whether @xmath2 admits an elementary flype .",
    "once the number of intervals in @xmath139 has been specified it is easily observed that due to the ability to rescale the angular support of horizontal arcs and the intervals of @xmath139 given @xmath79 there are combinatorially only a finite number of possible @xmath138 .",
    "next , we adapt the elementary moves on arc presentations to moves on @xmath138 so as to have them be monotonic simplifications with respect to @xmath151 .",
    "first , if the horizontal arcs @xmath152 of our original horizontal exchange move ( respectively , vertical arcs @xmath153 of the vertical exchange move ) are contained in a single interval of either @xmath154 \\setminus \\ci$ ] or @xmath139 , then we allow the performance of a horizontal ( respectively , vertical ) exchange move .",
    "second , in a similar fashion if @xmath155 ( respectively , @xmath156 ) are contained in a single interval of either @xmath157 \\setminus \\ci$ ] or @xmath139 then we again allow the performance of a horizontal ( respectively , vertical ) simplification .",
    "in both cases , if the move occurs in an interval of @xmath139 the complexity of our resulting @xmath138 is unchanged . for horizontal or vertical exchange moves , independent of",
    "what interval the move occurs in , the complexity measure is unchanged . for the simplification",
    "moves the occur in intervals of @xmath154 \\setminus \\ci$ ] the complexity of the resulting @xmath138 decreases .",
    "thus , we achieve monotonic simplification in our uses of our previous elementary moves by restricting their application to the intervals @xmath158 \\setminus \\ci ) \\cup \\ci$ ] .",
    "we now add two new elementary moves that utilizes the intervals of @xmath139 .",
    "we refer to figure [ figure : shear exchange](a ) .",
    "let @xmath94 and @xmath95 be two horizontal arcs of @xmath138 that are _ consecutive _ and _ nested _ with respect to @xmath139 .",
    "that is , first , for an interval @xmath159 \\setminus \\ci$ ] when we consider all of the horizontal arcs of @xmath138 the horizontal levels of @xmath94 and @xmath95 are consecutive in the ordering along @xmath160 .",
    "second , the angular support of @xmath94 restricted to an interval @xmath159 \\setminus \\ci$ ] is contained inside the angular support of @xmath95 restricted to @xmath161 .",
    "then we can interchange the horizontal level of these to arcs .",
    "this is achieved by first applying a horizontal shear to the portion of @xmath94 and @xmath95 that is contained in @xmath161 .",
    "thus , when we consider the resulting arc presentations an original horizontal exchange move is realizable .",
    "we abuse notation referring to the resulted arc presentation as @xmath138 .",

    "the closed @xmath0-braid obtained from the presentation transition @xmath170 admits , respectively , a destabilization , exchange move or elementary flype ( as seen from the standard projection @xmath41 ) .",
    "it should be readily evident that given an arc presentation @xmath79 one can generate only finitely many equivalent arc presentations through any sequence of horizontal and vertical exchange moves . as previously remarked combinatorially",
    "there are only finitely many possible choices for @xmath139 ( for one , two or three intervals ) .",

    "the production of such a finite set is easily seen as algorithmic .",
