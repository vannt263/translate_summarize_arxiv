    "we demonstrate that the latter also places an independent constraint on the imf of emp population in combination with the metal yields produced by the emp supernovae if the binary contribution is properly taken into account .",
    "we then apply the imf , thud derived , to discuss the chemical evolution in which the stars of emp population take part .",
    "the resultant imfs can reproduce the number and slope of observed metallicity distribution functions ( mdf ) for emp stars , and also , to give an explanation to the scarcity and origin of hmp / ump stars with the effects of hierarchical structure formation process included .",
    "in this paper , we , and discuss the basic characteristics of hierarchical structure formation by using simple analytic approximations .    this paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we discuss the constraints on the imf of emp population from the statistics of cemp stars and from the total number of emp survivors in our galaxies . in  3 , we investigate the metallicity distribution of emp stars in galactic halo with the formation process of the galaxy taken into account .",
    "then our conclusions follow with discussion of the origin of observed mdf and also of hmp stars . in appendix , we re - discuss the relationship between the number of emp survivors , estimated from the surveys , and the metal production by the emp supernovae with the binary contribution taken into account , to demonstrate that they entail the same imfs as drawn independently from the statistics of cemp stars .",
    "in this section , we revisit the problem of constraining the imf for the stars of emp population from the observations of emp survivors , studied in paper  i. the method is based on the analysis of statistics of cemp stars in the framework of binary scenario , and hence , involves the assumptions of emp binary systems .",
    "we start with reviewing the method and assumptions used in paper  i in deriving the constraints on the imf of emp population stars .",
    "we first investigate the dependence of resultant imf on these assumptions , in particular of the mass - ratio distribution of binary members .",

    "after that , the first stars in the collapsed clouds are no longer metal - free . nevertheless , those stars which are formed before each collapsed clouds are polluted by their own supernova form a distinct class from those which suffer from the first pollution .",
    "further study is necessary to make clear the present appearance of the possible pop  iii survivors and to settle the origin of hmp / ump stars , in particular , for tiny amounts of iron - group metals and the overwhelming carbon - enhancement , shared by all these stars known to date .",
    "we benefit greatly from discussion with dr .  w.  aoki . this paper is supported in part by grant - in - aid for scientific research from japan society for the promotion of science ( grant 18104003 and 18072001 ) .",
    "one of the important findings of the recent large - scaled surveys is the scarcity of emp stars in the galactic halo .",
    "the he s survey gives the total number of emp stars in our galactic halo at @xmath246 ( giants of @xmath247 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hes - g ] ) plus turn - off stars @xmath248 within the limiting magnitude @xmath249 .",
    "similarly , the hk survey gives @xmath250 within the limiting magnitude of @xmath251 ; 114 stars of @xmath0 } < -3 $ ] are found by the medium - resolution , follow - up spectroscopy of 50% of the candidates , selected from the objective prism survey covering the @xmath252 and @xmath253 areas in the northern and southern hemisphere @xcite . because of the significantly large areas covered by these surveys ( @xmath254 of all sky with the follow - up observations ) , we may place reliance on these results , granted that they may not be complete .",
    "this also constrains on the imf of stellar population that promoted the chemical evolution , or more specifically , the formation of metals and the low - mass survivors . in the paper , we have discussed the chemical evolution starting with the statistics of cemp stars . in this appendix , we show that the chemical evolution with the total number of emp survivors provides more stringent constraints on the imf of emp population with the aid of the amount of ejecta from supernova models , independently of the statistics of cemp stars .",
    "our basic premise is that the same stellar population is responsible both for the production of metals and of low - mass survivors . in discussing the low - mass survivors , it is indispensable to take into account the contribution from the binaries .",
    "this is one of the major conclusions in paper  i. we assume that the stars are born not only as single stars but also as the members of binaries in an equal number and with the primary stars in the same imf as the single stars . for a given imf ,",
    "then , the total number , @xmath255 of emp survivors , currently observed in the galactic halo , is related to the cumulative number , @xmath256 , of stars of emp population as ; @xmath257 ,   \\label{eq : frac - surv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and hence , to the cumulative number of emp supernovae as @xmath258 .",
    "these supernovae have to supply the amount of iron , @xmath73 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : emp - ironprod ] ) , in order to enrich the gas in the galaxy of mass @xmath204 with iron to promote the chemical evolution up to the metallicity @xmath0}= -2.5 $ ]",
    ". then , we may derive the averaged iron yield , @xmath259 , per supernova of emp population , necessary to explain the chemical evolution of galaxy , by the relation @xmath260 for an assumed imf with the mass - ratio distribution function .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : yield ] the averaged yield , @xmath259 , as a function of @xmath44 for @xmath189 : upper panel for the observations of emp stars of different evolutionary stages from the he s survey and of the total emp stars from the hk survey with use of the imfs with the flat mass - ratio function , and lower panel for the different mass - ratio functions with use of the observation of emp giants from the he s survey . in order to compare the stars of different evolutionary stages",
    ", we include the effects of the limiting magnitude of the surveys by assuming the de vaucouleurs density distribution , @xmath261 , with the radial distance , @xmath262 , from the galactic center , the same as the stars in the galactic halo and by assigning the luminosity of @xmath263 and @xmath264 to dwarfs and giants , respectively .",
    "the amount of iron demanded by the chemical evolution turns out to be a steep decrease function of @xmath44 since in order to leave a fixed number of low - mass survivors , the total number of stars of emp populations , and hence , the supernova fraction increase rapidly with @xmath44 in particular near @xmath265 .",
    "the necessary yields computed from the different samples in upper panel show a fairly good agreement with each other .",
    "the difference between the giants and dwarfs for the he s samples is indicative of a relatively deficiency of dwarf stars compared with giants by a factor of @xmath266 in number , which may be attributed to rather crude assignment of averaged giant luminosity , and/or to the different efficiency of identifying giants and turn - off stars in the survey plates , and/or to the uncertainties in the spatial density distribution .",
    "the results for the hk survey and the he s survey also agree within the difference by a factor of @xmath267 in number despite the difference in the limiting flux by 2 mag , and hence , to the difference in the searched volume by a factor of @xmath268 .",
    "the variations with the mass - ratio functions in the lower panel are caused by the difference in the number of supernovae per emp survivor .",
    "as compared to the flat mass - ratio function , the mass - ratio function increasing ( decreasing ) with @xmath120 give a larger ( smaller ) number of supernovae to produce one emp survivors ; the difference of which increases for higher - mass imfs .",
    "these iron yields necessary to promote the chemical evolution may be compared with the theoretical iron yields predicted from the supernova models .",
    "the imf - weighted iron yields , @xmath269 , per supernova is given by using the iron mass , @xmath270 , ejected from a massive star of initial mass @xmath271 as ; @xmath272 } { \\int_{m_{up } } dm_1 \\xi ( m_1 ) [ 1 + f_b \\int_{m_{up}/m_1}^1 n(q ) d q ] } .",
    "\\label{eq : yieldsn}\\ ] ] the imf averaged yield @xmath269 is also shown in this figure , for which the theoretical yields are taken from the metal - deficient supernova models computed by @xcite , and by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is a slowly increase function of @xmath44 for @xmath210 with the increase in the fraction of more massive stars that ended as supernovae , while beyond it , the gradient grows steeper owing to the contribution of the electron pair - instability supernovae of @xmath273 .    the averaged yields , demanded by the chemical evolution , and the theoretical imf - weighted iron yields both meet with each other near @xmath274 and with the iron yield @xmath275 per supernova .",
    "as typically seen for the flat mass - ratio distribution , the parameter range coincides with that we have derived for the imfs from the cemp statistics in figs .",
    "[ fig : psi]-[fig : nos ] . for higher - mass imfs",
    ", the emp stellar population can not produce the sufficient number of low - mass survivors by themselves , while for lower - mass imfs , it results short of iron production . the differences arising from the mass - ratio distributions seem discernible but not large enough to differentiate these mass - ratio distributions in view of the uncertainties of current observations . as",
    "compared with the flat distribution , the mass - ratio distribution increasing ( decreasing ) with @xmath120 demands smaller ( larger ) @xmath44 , the opposite tendency derived from the cemp statistics .",
    "these distributions prefer smaller ( larger ) number of emp survivors , larger ( smaller ) fraction of cemp-@xmath7  stars and smaller ( larger ) ratio of cemp - no@xmath7  to cemp-@xmath7  stars . in principle , however , we can discriminate the mass - ratio functions in the emp binaries , including those destructed already by the evolution , with use of the survey and observations of emp stars in sufficiently large number and with sufficient accuracy , which waits for future works .    in the above discussion , we assume a single log - normal imf with the binary fraction for the stellar population .",
    "it is possible to assume the bi - modal imf and to explain the production of iron and the formation of low - mass stars , separately , in terms of the combination of two stellar populations , one with a higher - mass imf responsible for the iron production and the other with a lower - mass imf for the low - mass survivors , respectively . in the case of bi - modal imfs , the constraints , derived here ,",
    "place an upper mass limit to the imf of lower - mass population and an lower mass limit to the imf of higher - mass population .",
    "it is to be noted that the imf with the binary mass function of cases a - c is regarded as a sort of bi - modal imf with the primary plus single stars as the higher - mass population and the secondary stars as the lower - mass population ( see fig .  12 in paper  i ) ; the separation of two imfs differs with the mass - ratio function and the relative contributions of two populations vary with the binary fraction . in any case , as for the emp stars in the galactic halo , the statistics of cemp stars , in particular , the ratio of cemp - no@xmath7  and cemp-@xmath7  stars , place the lower mass limit to the imf of the lower - mass population , and hence , endorses the high - mass imf , which narrows , if any , the contribution of the higher - mass population .",
