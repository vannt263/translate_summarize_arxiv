    "the actual incident field on a cylinder labled with index @xmath44 is @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "we are interested in solving the helmholtz equation for the total field ,  @xmath46 , where @xmath47 in the region outside the cylinders and @xmath48 inside the cylinders . the method used to solve this equation is separation of variables in polar coordinates .",
    "of course , the solution of the homogeneous helmholtz equation in polar coordinates is well known .",
    "all field quantities may be written in the form of fourier - bessel series with the coefficients @xmath49 and @xmath50 determined from the boundary conditions .",
    "hence , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53  are two conjugate cylindrical functions .",
    "these functions are either the first order bessel functions @xmath54 and @xmath55 or the second order bessel functions ( hankel functions ) @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the pair chosen depends on the boundary conditions . outside the cylinders the asymptotic behavior determines",
    "which functions are used . since only the @xmath57 function has the behavior of an out - propagating cylindrical wave , the field of the scattered wave @xmath42 has to be written using only @xmath57 of the \\{@xmath58 , @xmath57 } pair .",
    "hence the scattered field is @xmath59 . inside the cylinders we have to choose the \\{@xmath54 , @xmath55 } pair because the hankel functions are both singular at the origin .",
    "this behavior comes from the @xmath55 part of the hankel function ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 and thus only the @xmath54 functions can be kept for the interior . in this case the total internal field is @xmath62 .    after expressing the incident field in polar coordinates , i.e. in a fourier - bessel series",
    ", we can write the electric and magnetic field continuity conditions at the boundaries of each cylinder . this gives us a system of equations with the unknowns being the fourier - bessel coefficients of the scattered field outside the cylinders and total field inside the cylinders .",
    "the system can be simplified by using the relationship between the bessel - fourier coefficients of a field incident on a cylinder and the coefficients for the scattered and internal fields @xcite .",
    "the optimization is based on the minimization of a functional , which is defined as the residual error between the calculated angular distribution of the normal component of the poynting vector @xmath63 and a distribution expressed as a target function .",
    "this error function is computed starting from the difference in intensity between the target and the result . in 2d",
    "the error is calculated along an observation line ( often a circle around the group of cylinders ) .",
    "this line is divided into small portions and the normal component of the s vector is calculated in the center of each segment .",
    "let the target function @xmath64 be the angular distribution of intensity exiting the circular observation region and @xmath65 the normal component of the real part of the poynting vector ( @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the normal unit vector ) . in this space of functions defined on @xmath68 ,",

    "choosing @xmath75  assures that each improvement is considered with the same weight . when choosing @xmath76  improvements made in regions where the target and the results are very different influence the integral @xmath70 more than a few smaller improvements in other regions",
    "this means that @xmath28 tends to ensure an uniform convergence while @xmath76 favors reduction of major differences between target and result .",
    "the greater the numerical value of @xmath74 , the more important this effect becomes , while for @xmath77  the effect is reversed . and",
    "finally , a negative exponent @xmath74 tends to push the solution further away from the target , in a manner which depends on the numerical value of @xmath74 .",
    "one could use different exponents for different stages of the iterative process .",
    "for example @xmath28 could be used at the beginning of the convergence procedure to avoid local minima .",
    "later , the value of @xmath74 could be increased to accelerate convergence towards a minimum .",
    "furthermore , if one decides that this minimum is not sufficiently close to the target function , application of a negative exponent would divert the iterations from this local minimum to some intermediate point were @xmath76 iterations could be restarted in the search for a better minimum .",
    "we use the real part of the poynting vector in our calculation of @xmath65 . for most scattering directions",
    "this is the poynting vector of the total field , with the exception of the input beam region where we use the scattered field in the first example ( the top - hat target function ) and the difference between the poynting vector of the input field and total field in the second example ( the @xmath2 target function ) .",
    "the distances , or errors , _ d _ are computed numerically by dividing the observation circle into very small and equal portions and the integral replaced by a sum over these portions  @xmath78  where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are normalization factors .",
    "different normalization methods can be used such as normalization to the maximum value , normalization to the sum of all values , or normalization to the sum of the squares . since in our case",
    "the functions involve intensity we have chosen the normalization to be the sum _",
    "i.e. _ the total power .",
    "although not used in this paper , it is worth mentioning that when optimizing for a modal shape distribution ( both amplitude and phase ) a better choice for error function would be the overlap integral between the actual field distribution and the desired modal field distribution .",
    "in this situation the target would be maximized ."

    "<S> optimization algorithms using 2d electromagnetic solvers are always more compute intensive than those for 1d structures . </S>",

    "<S> the input beam might be launched into this slab from a ridge waveguide . in our simulations , the wavelength of the light is @xmath24 @xmath7 m and the polarization is te . </S>",

    "<S> [ ribmode](b ) for the 3d and fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ ribmode](d ) for the 2d simulation results ) are primarily due to the nonuniformity of the field and structure in the _ z _ direction but also because of the difference between the gaussian beam and the ridge mode and the fundamently 3d discontinuity between the ridge waveguide and the slab . </S>",
    "<S> these differences translate into a 30% decrease in peak intensity and 25% decrease in the total power directed in the desired direction for the 3d simulation compared to the 2d one ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ ribmode ] ( c ) ) .      </S>",
    "<S> we analyzed the influence of small changes in the wavelength of the incident beam on error . </S>",
    "<S> we took the optimized configuration from the @xmath2 target example ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ final2](a ) ) and simulated the effect of changing the frequency of the input light . </S>",
    "<S> the relative deviation from the minimum error is shown in fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> modulated ] as a function of the electromagnetic wave frequency shift . </S>",
    "<S> frequency variations of @xmath34 ghz only change the error by 0.3% of its minimum value . </S>",
    "<S> thus an optical beam centered at wavelength @xmath24 @xmath7 m modulated at very high speed will behave essentially as the simulated monochromatic wave at @xmath24 @xmath7 m ( 200 thz ) . </S>",
    "<S> even a 1 thz deviation in frequency changes the error by only 6  7 % .    </S>",
    "<S> another important issue is the sensitivity of the aperiodic nano - photonic design to variations and errors introduced by the fabrication process . as an initial study we explored the sensitivity of the design to changes in the position of the cylinders . </S>",
    "<S> other parameters that are influenced by fabrication processes such as the diameter and detailed shape of the cylinders , index of refraction , direction of the input ridge waveguide with respect to the cylinders , etc . , are not analyzed in this paper .    </S>",
    "<S> to estimate the sensitivity to position , for the same @xmath35 target function example , we use the following method . </S>",
    "<S> first , one by one the cylinders are displaced by a small fixed distance @xmath36 in the positive and negative @xmath10 and @xmath37 directions and the change in error is evaluated for each cylinder ( the maximum error created out of the 4 displacements ) . </S>",
    "<S> the displacement values used are small compared to the initial diameters of the cylinders ( @xmath38 nm ) . </S>",
    "<S> five values for the displacement @xmath36 are considered : 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , and 50 nm . next the 10 displaced cylinders with the greatest influence on the error are selected . </S>",
    "<S> these cylinders , as expected , are located in regions associated with high field intensity .    </S>",
    "<S> the selected cylinders are all individually moved randomly by the same step size in the positive and negative @xmath10 and @xmath37 directions ( each movement has the same 1/4 probability ) . </S>",
    "<S> the movement of each cylinder is independent of the movements of the other selected cylinders . this way we generate a number of slightly modified configurations . </S>",
    "<S> the errors for 10 of these modified configurations are computed for each displacement value and a combined plot generated ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ histo ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we chose this very simplified method for estimating the sensitivity to position because a more complete approach would involve independent displacements of each cylinder in completely random directions and with variable distances and hence give rise to significant computational effort . </S>",
    "<S> the plot in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ histo ] , suggests that 10 nm precision in fabrication might be needed to ensure less than 10% increase in minimum error for devices operating at wavelength @xmath24 @xmath7 m .      in recent years , spatially </S>",
    "<S> periodic dielectric structures have been studied and applied to both optics and microwaves @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that introduction of point and line defects in pcs can be used to filter , demultiplex , and guide electromagnetic waves @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , there are numerous unresolved design issues with pc inspired devices that limit prospects of adoption as practical components . </S>",
    "<S> for example , when coupling between standard fibers or waveguides and pc waveguides , the back reflection is either unacceptably large @xcite or requires use of relatively large coupling regions @xcite . as another example </S>",
    "<S> , it is well known that the necessarily finite size of the pc can have a dramatic and detrimental impact on device performance @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> solutions to these and similar problems are stymied by the limited number of degrees of freedom inherent to pc design . </S>",
    "<S> rather than struggle for solutions within the constraints of spatial symmetry imposed by pc structures , our approach is based on breaking the underlying spatial symmetries and thereby exposing larger numbers of degrees of freedom with which to design and optimize nano - photonic devices .    </S>",
    "<S> our experience so far indicates that optimization of such systems is best achieved using numerical adaptive design techniques . </S>",
    "<S> this is because solutions , such as that illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ final2 ] , have such a high degree of broken symmetry it is unlikely analytic methods or conventional intuition could usefully be applied .      in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that aperiodic nano - photonic dielectric structures designed using adaptive algorithms can be tailored to closely match desired electromagnetic transmission and scattering properties . </S>",
    "<S> it is the broken symmetry of the structure that allows more degrees of freedom and the possibility of better optimization compared to symmetric photonic crystal structures .    in general the frequency response and spatial response of this system can have very complicated forms . </S>",
    "<S> it is the large number of degrees of freedom that allow us to tailor the response to the desired target . </S>",
    "<S> the configuration space is even more complex if materials with optical loss or gain are considered .    </S>",
