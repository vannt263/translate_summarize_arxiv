    "various structures in different regimes are mentioned with different notations .",
    "even though , these structures were defined in presence of shear , in this paper , we follow the same notations as prescribed by k.negita et.al.,@xcite in representing structural regimes . in these structurqal regimes , tumbling motion of the director @xmath12 is expected to occur@xcite,@xcite,@xcite . as the director precesses about neutral or vortex direction with angular frequency @xmath13 , the equation of motion is described by @xmath14 is an equation of ellipse . here",

    "this is an @xmath34 x - ray diffraction measurement .",
    "recently , anomalous diffusion , sub and super diffusive regimes and director@xmath35 deformations around a sphere in standard liquid crystals like 5cb were described by analyzing the @xmath36 from thermal motion of colloidal particle@xcite . in this paper , we rediscoverd the non - equilibrium flow conditions of the nematic@xmath37 to smectic a@xmath38 transition in 8cb liquid crystals by analyzing the brownian motion of colloidal particle .",
    "vacf @xmath39 , is the rate of change in diffusion that represents the amplitude @xmath40 of the deformed structures when diameter of the probing particle is nearly equal to the wavelength of the deformed structures .",
    "so , @xmath36 is used in determining the time averaged distribution of the director @xmath12 under flow to reveal a sequence of structures in both parallel and perpendicular directions to the director @xmath12 orientations .",
    "these amplitudes and periodicity of the structures are compared with measurements by x - ray diffraction and shear rheology experiments .",
    "further , a generic approach by fitting the @xmath39 with time dependent harmonic oscillations under different conditions is followed .",
    "this approach reveals the kind of structural transitions , micro structural properties like relaxation time @xmath41 , frequency of oscillations of the director ( @xmath42 ) and micro mechanical properties like elastic constant @xmath43 . also , we measure the quality factor @xmath44 of precessional motion of @xmath12 , which represents the stability of fluctuations . since",
    ", these precessional motions @xmath12 are known to be anisotropic , in nematic phase of 8cb liquid crystals , it is important to study microstructural and micromechanical properties in both parallel and perpendicular directions to the director orientation .",
    "for a specific molecular alignment in the 8cb liquid crystals , the colloidal silica spheres of 0.98@xmath45 in size are coated with a monolayer of octadecyldimethy(3-trimethoxysilylpropyl)ammonium chloride(dmoap , sigma aldrich)@xcite .",

    "the uniform dispersion of micro spheres in a planar cell which is coated with al-1254 on the glass slides and rubbed in one direction , are temperature controlled with a temperature controller(instec ) whose resolution is upto @xmath46 . in this planar aligned liquid crystal cell ,",
    "the molecules get arranged in the ( x , y ) plane and aligned parallel to the y - direciton .",
    "that means , the axis of symmetry of the liquid crystals molecules is along y - axis as shown in fig.[8cb picture].this sample was observed under an inverted polarizing microscope(nikon eclipse , t__i _ _ - u ) with a microscope objective lens of 100x magnification .",
    "video microscopy is used in the single particle tracking of an isolated colloidal micro sphere to measure its brownian motion .",
    "the position and brownian motion of the colloidal particle is measured with the help of an appropriate computer program .",
    "the total experimental instrumentation used here are very similar to those mentioned in our previous paper@xcite .",
    "the brownian motion of an isolated micro sphere is video recorded for about 5 minutes and analyzed .",
    "measurements are repeated with in the same and different cells .",
    "transition characteristics of 8cb liquid crystals are mentioned in our previous work@xcite .",
    "in previous experimental measurements @xcite the structural regimes in 8cb liquid crystals are analyzed using elp theory and critical nematodynamics , where shear stress is applied on the material to understand the dissipative nature in various structural regimes and hence the precessional motions of @xmath12 .",
    "but , under zero shear conditions , considering elp theory may not be a appropriate approach .",
    "for example , in determining the angular frequency of precessional motion of @xmath12 , equation [ frequency ] contains shear rate @xmath47 , so , under no shear conditions , structures in 8cb liquid crystals can not be analyzed .    in any disordered or complex medium ,",
    "when the colloidal probe is of the same diameter as of the wavelength of disordered structures , colloidal particle gets navigated through disordered structures .",
    "hence , single particle tracking technique is used in determining the precessional motion of @xmath12 and is a correct and simple approach under no shear limits . according to safinya et.al .",
    ", in 8cb liquid crystals , as the temperature is reduced , for transitions from @xmath48 to @xmath49 , the interplay between the viscous frictional forces and the flow induced fluctuation forces on the nematic director leads to a series of structural regimes@xcite . in the isotropic phase , vacf of 8cb liquid crystals",
    "have shown normal diffusive behavior and when the temperature is reduced to just below n - i , at @xmath50 , these structures are flow aligning nematogens , similar to nematic regime of 5cb liquid crystals . in such a case ,",
    "the coupling of the sphere s displacements to the director field and its fluctuations leads to anomalous subdiffusion .",
    "this subdiffusion is defined as fluctuative displacement of the sphere , that temporarily increases elastic energy density say , on to the left side to its motion and decreases it on the right side .",
    "this difference in elastic energy density creates a restoring elastic force @xmath51 which slows down the diffusion . @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the change in displacement from left side to right side . as shown in figure [ figure 2(a ) ] , values of @xmath36 are negative representing sub diffusive nature@xcite .",
    "but , curve fitting for these vacf gave positive values for the amplitudes in both parallel and perpendicular directions to the director .",
    "this represents , the direction of the flow alignment of the director being with its direction near the flow direction(y - axis ) . from , @xmath54 to @xmath55 transition point , the amplitude of the vacf curves have changed from positive to negative value .",
    "below @xmath55 regime , because of presmectic translations , there arises few layer formations in this regime .",
    "these layers gets rearranged and hence there exists compression on to the central portion of the liquid crystals .",
    "details of the physical origin of the structural regimes in 8cb liquid crystals under zero shear conditions was explained in our previous work@xcite .",
    "vacf for structures below @xmath55 regime , were presented as shown in figures [ figure 2(a ) ] , [ figure 2(b ) ] , [ figure 2(c ) ] , [ figure 2(d ) ] .",
    "these figures resemble the tumbling nematic director behavior in the apparent viscosity vs shear strain of shear rheology experiments @xcite . from kubo",
    "s relation[eq-1 ] , both memory function @xmath36 and viscosity are related , hence the resemblance . in case of bulk rheolgy experiments , within apparent viscosity vs shear strain , when @xmath56 begins to diverge , there is a rapid increase in the oscillation amplitude with the decrease in temperature , and near @xmath57 regime , the damping of oscillation amplitude occurs rapidly .",
    "similar characteristics were observed for @xmath58 . where as , @xmath59 decreases continuously in the values of oscillation amplitudes .",
    "this damping in oscillation amplitude may be due to several factors like out of plane motion of the director , the suppressive effect of the increasing elastic torque , and the appearance of a poly domain structure .",
    "but , clearly the faster decay in oscillation amplitudes near @xmath60 can be attributed to the out of plane motion of the director@xcite . also ,",
    "as the colloidal particle passes through these structures , it dissipates energy , hence it can be observed as damping in oscillation amplitude .    , vacf vs time in @xmath54 regime ,",

    "many complex fluids like actomysin cells @xcite , lipid bilayers @xcite follow the dynamics observed in this study with 8cb liquid crystals .",
