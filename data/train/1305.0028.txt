    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) package provided by the _ spitzer _ science center ( ssc ) to mosaic the individual artifact - corrected basic calibrated data ( bcds ) and produce a single image mosaic in each band ( for both irac and mips , i left the first frame out of each set of observations when mosaicking , since it often has a far shorter exposure time than the rest of the bcds and therefore adds mostly noise to the mosaic ) .",
    "i also applied the array location - dependent photometric corrections to the irac bcds within mopex .",
    "flux measurements were obtained with point - response function ( prf ) fitting within apex ( astronomical point source extractor ) , in multi - frame mode for irac and single - frame mode for mips .",

    "a single ssc - provided prf was used to obtain the photometry from the mips 24 @xmath3 m mosaic .",
    "the prf fluxes were aperture- and color - corrected following the prescriptions provided by the online instrument handbooks .",
    "the flux densities for sn 1995n in each band are listed in table  [ tabphot ] and are shown in figure  [ figdust ] .",
    "one can see in figure  [ figdust ] that the data are nominally consistent with a blackbody spectrum at dust temperature @xmath37 k. the blackbody radius is @xmath38 cm ( @xmath39 au or @xmath40 pc ) .",
    "( this holds if the dust is optically thick , whereas i assume , below , that the dust is optically thin ; so , this radius is effectively a lower limit on the actual size of the dust shell ; e.g. , @xcite  @xcite . ) for the progenitor wind speed of @xmath41 km s@xmath27 @xcite , matter at this radius was lost by the star @xmath42 yr prior to explosion . assuming the sn shock was expanding at @xmath43",
    "km s@xmath27 @xcite when the _ spitzer _ data were obtained , after @xmath44 yr the shock radius would have been @xmath45 cm .",
    "the shock therefore appears to be within the blackbody radius , so it is unlikely that the dust was freshly formed in the sn ejecta ( the dust is also relatively cold , and , if freshly formed , we would expect it to be warmer ) or within the cds in the interaction region .",
    "it is more likely that the emission arises from pre - existing dust in the unshocked csm .",
    "following @xcite , i can estimate the radius , @xmath46 , of the dust - free cavity that the sn evacuated in the dusty csm by its initial outburst .",
    "i can constrain the maximum blue luminosity from the optical light curves shown in @xcite ; note , however , that we do not know the actual maximum , since the sn was discovered at @xmath47 months in age .",

    "following @xcite and @xcite , the wavelength - dependent flux density for an optically thin point source ( an `` idealized dust cloud '' ) is    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the planck function at the dust temperature @xmath57 , @xmath58 is the dust mass , @xmath59 is the distance to the host galaxy in mpc , and @xmath60 is the mass absorption coefficient for the dust .",
    "this latter term is given by    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is the wavelength - dependent dust absorption coefficient , @xmath63 is the dust grain radius , and @xmath64 is the grain mass density . here",
    "i have assumed the dust models from @xcite for graphite and smoothed uv `` astronomical silicates , '' with @xmath65 g @xmath66 @xcite and @xmath67 g @xmath66 @xcite , respectively .",
    "i have selected a single grain size , @xmath68 @xmath3 m , although the choice of @xmath63 has little impact on @xmath60 in the rayleigh limit ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "one can see in figure  [ figdust ] that the silicate dust model spectrum from equation  [ eq1 ] compares reasonably well with the 8 and 24 @xmath3 m data points , less so for the shorter - waveband data .",
    "dust models that are predominantly silicates have been applied previously for a number of sne ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . additionally ,",
    "if the sn 1995n progenitor were analogous to irc + 10420 , we might expect the csm to be composed primarily of silicate dust ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the graphite model provides a better comparison at the shortest bands , however , it is a comparatively poorer match at 8 and 24 @xmath3 m .",
    "unfortunately , the overall dust spectrum , compared to the _ spitzer _ data , is relatively unconstrained , since no _ spitzer _ observations were obtained of this field with the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) in either peak - up imaging mode at 16 @xmath3 m or in staring spectroscopic mode .",
    "( the observations that were conducted , although obtained during the cryogenic phase of the _ spitzer _ mission , did not become publicly available till well after the cryogen was exhausted , when irs observations were no longer possible . )",
    "the high 70 @xmath3 m upper limit ( not shown ) provides a poor constraint on the model .",
    "although no additional _ spitzer _ observations were obtained , i consider the flux densities for the sn from the _ wise _ all - sky data release in all four bands , using the zero points and color corrections provided in the _ wise _ explanatory supplement .",
    "the flux densities are given in table  [ tabphot2 ] and shown in figure  [ figdust2 ] .",
    "interestingly , the _ wise _ data tend to agree better with the graphite model than with the silicate one .",
    "i note , however , as the explanatory supplement warns , that the flux densities in bands w1 and w2 at these low levels are systematically underestimated . additionally , a measure of the reliability of a _ wise _ flux extraction is a comparison of the number of individual frames for which profile fitting for the photometry was possible , for sources with a signal - to - noise ratio @xmath70 on each frame , versus the total number of available individual frames . for these observations ,",
    "the total in all four bands was 25 frames ; the numbers of frames for which profile - fit flux measurements were possible were 15 , 3 , 12 , and 0 , respectively , for w1 , w2 , w3 , and w4 ( the ultimate @xmath71 is only @xmath72 in w4 ) .",
    "therefore , as a result of the lower sensitivity of the _ wise _ survey data compared to the relatively deep , pointed _ spitzer _",
    "observations , the _ wise _ data for sn 1995n should possess less weight in the overall analysis .    integrating the silicate model dust spectrum , the total ir luminosity emitted by the dust would then be @xmath73 erg s@xmath27 , or @xmath74 .",
    "the ir luminosity of the blackbody alone is @xmath75 erg s@xmath27 ( the luminosity of the graphite model is essentially the same as this ) .",
    "@xcite modeled the near - ir emission from sn 1995n using an ir echo model from a pre - existing , spherically - symmetric csm , following the formalism of @xcite .",
    "i show in figure  [ figlc ] the luminosity of the sn in 2009 , estimated both from the blackbody and the silicate dust model , and compare these with an extrapolation in time of the model light curve that @xcite constructed with the assumption that the input luminosity from the sn is a short flash .",
    "one can see that the echo model underpredicts the observations by a factor @xmath76 .",
    "the echo alone , therefore , can not account for the observed sn mid - ir luminosity .",
    "note , however , that the model light curve was fit by @xcite to an extrapolation of the near - ir color , which represents only the hottest dust .",
    "( mid - ir observations at earlier times , had they been feasible , would have provided a better constraint on the total ir evolution and would have sampled dust at a larger range of temperatures . ) note also that for this light curve model  @xcite  assumed that some pre - sn event had created the dust - free cavity in the csm , rather than the sn itself , and they treated @xmath46 and @xmath77 as being independent of each other .",
    "however , we would not necessarily expect such an event for a progenitor star analogous to the post - rsg irc + 10420 .",
    "the luminosity from the echo model potentially can be augmented if i also take into account the dust emission resulting from the absorption and reprocessing of the x - ray and uv radiation arising from the shock - csm interaction .",
    "@xcite also pointed out that the ir emission from sn 1995n at very late times could be better explained by sustained emission from the csm interaction .",
    "the x - rays from this interaction were first detected on 1996 july 23 @xcite , @xmath78 d after explosion ( it is unknown when this x - ray emission from the interaction began ) . the time - averaged x - ray ( 0.12.4 and 0.57.0 kev ) unabsorbed flux from the light curves in @xcite corresponds to @xmath79 erg s@xmath27 .",
    "no similar uv light curve exists for the sn , however , a partial estimate of the uv luminosity can be obtained by integrating the _ hst _ fos uv spectrum analyzed by @xcite and by assuming an extinction of @xmath80 mag ( ned ; * ? ? ?",
    "this results in @xmath81 erg s@xmath27 . from (",
    "* their figure 11 ) the planck - averaged emissivity of silicate grains at @xmath82  k is @xmath83 , irrespective of grain size .",
    "thus , although without constructing a detailed model , i can account for an additional @xmath84 erg s@xmath27 of reprocessed x - ray and uv flux from the dust .",
    "( this estimate does not include the sustained optical emission from the csm interaction . ) in total , then , it is feasible that the very late - time ir luminosity from sn 1995n is a combination of both a fading ir echo from the initial sn flash and dust re - radiation of the emission produced by the long - term interaction of the shock and the csm .",
    "it is not known what was the level of csm interaction occurring when the _ spitzer _ data were obtained .",
    "the epochs of the _ spitzer _ and _ wise _ observations were well past the last x - ray and radio data obtained by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the last optical spectrum from 2010 shown in @xcite appears to be dominated by the intermediate - width h and forbidden o lines , presumably from the unshocked ejecta .",
    "the dust mass that results from the simple silicate model spectrum ( equation  [ eq1 ] ) is @xmath85 . the graphite model , which provides an overall poor comparison with the _ spitzer _ data , requires an even larger dust mass of @xmath86 .",
    "assuming a gas - to - dust ratio of @xmath87 @xcite , this implies that the total mass in the nebula containing the dust is @xmath88@xmath89 .",
    "the mass - loss rate from the progenitor star was likely high , at @xmath90 yr@xmath27 @xcite .",
    "such a mass - loss rate is consistent with that found for irc + 10420 ( @xmath91@xmath92 yr@xmath27 ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite concluded that the wind was clumpy up to @xmath93 yr of the x - ray light curve for sn 1995n , and that the csm density distribution must have been smoother farther out ( at later times in the interaction ) .",
    "no indication exists , even at later times ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , for any extinction other than that from the galactic foreground ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "so , the assumption of optically thin dust in the nebula is supported .",
    "however , if the sn 1995n progenitor was analogous to irc + 10420 , the latter star is currently surrounded by an optically thick dust shell ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "much of the dust that existed outside of the dust - free cavity in the inner csm of sn 1995n could have been destroyed by the outgoing shock in the assumed @xmath94 months after explosion and before discovery  at an expansion velocity of 10000 km s@xmath27 ( the highest velocity inferred from the broad emission line component ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the shock would have expanded to @xmath95 cm , or @xmath96 % of the blackbody radius .",
    "the broad component has weakened in more recent spectra @xcite , so the expansion has decelerated ( as the shock moved through the dense csm ) . nonetheless , as calculated above , the shock was already at @xmath97  % of the blackbody radius in 2009 , so a significant fraction of the dust in the csm possibly has been destroyed .",
    "the star irc + 10420 shows outer , spherical circumstellar shells ejected from the star @xmath13000 yr ago ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* )  if the sn 1995n progenitor was analogous to this star , then the dust emission from 20092010 may have been from similar shells in the outermost extent of the csm . in summary",
    ", this indicates that the total gas and dust mass of the csm around the progenitor initially may have been substantially larger than the estimate i have made , above , based on the dust mass implied by the _ spitzer",
    "_ observations .",

    "spitzer _ and _ wise_. this emission provides an important probe of the circumstellar environment of the progenitor star .",
    "i have applied a simple silicate dust model , which agrees best with the _ spitzer _ data , and have found that this model is consistent with a blackbody temperature of 240 k and a ir luminosity of @xmath73 erg s@xmath27 for the dust .",
    "a graphite model does not compare as well with the _ spitzer _ observations , although it does compare better with the less - sensitive _ wise _ data .",
    "i conclude that the dust emission did not arise from freshly - formed dust in the ejecta or from dust condensing in the cds of the shock interaction region .",
    "this emission more likely arose from pre - existing circumstellar dust , heated by a combination of the long - lived ir echo from the initial sn flash and the sustained x - ray / uv ( and , probably , optical ) flux from the sn shock / csm interaction , e.g. , as modeled by @xcite .",
    "much of the original dust in the progenitor pre - sn wind has likely been destroyed as the shock has expanded through the csm .",
    "this result , of heated pre - existing dust in the csm , is consistent with what has been found for the sn iin 2010jl by @xcite and for the type `` ibn '' sn 2006jc by @xcite .",
    "@xcite speculated that the sn 1995n progenitor was a highly - luminous rsg which had experienced a super - wind , analogous to the extreme galactic rsg vy cma and the post - rsg irc + 10420 .",
    "the size of the dust - emitting region ( radius @xmath98 au ) inferred for sn 1995n is comparable to the largest extent of the csm around vy cma and irc + 10420 , and the mass in the sn 1995n progenitor nebula is comparable to that found for the two galactic stars @xcite .",
    "the mid - ir data , therefore , lends credence to this view of the sn progenitor .",
    "the observed late - time dust emission from sn 1995n implies that the dust mass was @xmath4@xmath5 .",
    "i note that , although the observed dust is relatively cool , @xmath6  k , even colder dust , at @xmath99  k , may exist in even larger quantities and simply was not detected in the mid - ir by _",

    "as has been suggested before , e.g. , by @xcite , evidence is continuing to accrue that the highly - massive progenitors of these strongly - interacting sne , rather than the sne themselves , may contribute significant amounts of dust to galaxies .",
