    "it has been inferred from @xmath6-spectroscopy of @xmath4th that this nucleus possesses an isomeric state at an energy of only a few ev above the ground state , establishing the lowest excitation energy that is known in nuclear physics .",

    "this system has stimulated a number of proposals for studies of the effects of atomic electrons on the nuclear transition ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these can be expected to be especially pronounced here because of the matching of the nuclear and electronic excitation energies .",
    "the radiative decay of the isomeric state can be strongly enhanced in a so - called electronic bridge process where the nucleus excites the electron shell and a photon is finally emitted in an electronic transition .",
    "vice versa , in an inverse electronic bridge process , laser excitation of the nucleus can be more efficient by making use of an electronic excitation that will resonantly couple to the nuclear moments .",
    "since the nuclear transition frequency in @xmath4th is accessible by frequency upconversion of narrow - bandwidth laser sources and since it is less sensitive to external perturbations than transition frequencies of the electron shell , we have proposed it as the basis of an optical nuclear clock of high precision  @xcite .",
    "experiments towards this goal are now pursued with different approaches  @xcite .",
    "up to now , the large uncertainty of the nuclear transition frequency and its location in the vacuum - ultraviolet range has prevented the observation of excitation or decay of the isomeric state of @xmath4th by means of optical spectroscopy . as a technique to achieve resonant excitation of the @xmath4th nucleus with the use of conventional laser sources ,",

    "recent relativistic hartree - fock calculations indicate an exponential increase of the energy level density towards the ionization energy of 11.9  ev  @xcite .",
    "while the high density of electronic energy levels in th@xmath1 increases the probability for a strong resonance enhancement of electronic bridge processes leading to excitation of the @xmath4th nucleus , it also poses an experimental problem : laser excitation of an ensemble of atoms from the ground state to a definite excited state is often inefficient for a multi - level system such as th@xmath1 because spontaneous decay leads to the accumulation of population in metastable levels that are decoupled from the laser .",
    "if the number of metastable levels is not too high , additional repumper lasers may be applied for reexcitation from each of those states .",
    "otherwise , atoms in metastable states can be returned to the ground state by inelastic quenching collisions with a buffer gas .",
