    "the density of states ( dos ) of disordered _ interacting _ electronic systems exhibits singularity near the fermi energy .",
    "this phenomenon manifests itself in the suppression of the tunneling conductance at small external bias and is referred to as zero bias anomaly ( zba ) .",
    "it has been explained and investigated theoretically by altshuler and aronov ( aa ) in 1979 for @xmath1 and latter extended for lower dimensionality by altshuler aronov and lee @xcite(for a review see ref .",
    "they have predicted that for a d  dimensional system with diffusive disorder and weak short range interactions the singular correction to the dos behaves as @xmath2 with the dimensionality @xmath3 .",
    "for three dimensional ( @xmath1 ) samples the zba constitutes a small but nonanalytic correction to the dos ( as long as the dimensionless conductance , @xmath4 , is large , @xmath5 ) . it may be argued subsequently that this phenomenon is a precursor of the `` coulomb gap '' , which appears in the anderson insulator regime , @xmath6 . throughout this paper",
    "we shall consider good conductors , hence we shall not discuss here the localized regime .",
    "but remarkably enough , even for good metals , @xmath5 , there is a situation where the zba is a strong effect .",
    "this is the case with a finite size system .",
    "the original treatment of aa was given for infinite ( quasi ) d  dimensional systems .",
    "for a finite size system the quantization of the spectrum of the diffusive modes becomes of crucial importance .",
    "for instance , the electron  electron interaction term in the hamiltonian takes the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 are quantized momenta , @xmath9 is the @xmath10 component of the electron density operator and @xmath11 denotes normal ordering .",
    "the quantization of the momentum has two major consequences for the zba .",
    "first , if one accounts for all finite @xmath10 , excluding the @xmath12 mode , in the interaction hamiltonian , the singularity in the dos is rounded off on the scale @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the thouless correlation energy .",
    "as long as the zba is still a small correction to the total dos on the scale @xmath14 , @xmath15}$ ] , the finite @xmath10 modes _ do not _ enhance the singularity for @xmath16 .",
    "it is easy to see @xcite that the requirement @xmath15}$ ] is satisfied for @xmath5 ; in this case the finite @xmath10 contribution to the zba is small for _ any _ energy and temperature .",
    "it means that for such systems the finite @xmath10 interaction may indeed be treated by perturbation theory , which produces regular expansion in powers of @xmath17 . throughout this paper",
    "we shall assume that the condition @xmath5 is satisfied , hence the perturbative treatment of the non ",
    "zero modes is applicable .",
    "the second consequence of the spectrum quantization is the special role played by the @xmath12 term in the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "its contribution to the energy may be written as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the total number of electrons in a dot .",
    "this term in fact corresponds to the classical charging energy of the dot .",
    "it leads to a strong singularity in the dos .",
    "the first order in interaction perturbative result is @xmath20 ( for the @xmath12 contribution @xmath21 and @xmath22 are not interchangeable ) . in the limit @xmath23 ,",
    "the perturbative treatment is not sufficient .",
    "we present here a relatively simple method which allows us to treat @xmath12 contribution to the zba exactly .",
    "an exact solution is possible due to the fact that the zero  mode interaction term commutes with the total hamiltonian . as a result",
    "the problem is trivial , although the zero  mode interaction has some interesting consequences .",
    "the thermodynamical and the response functions are practically unaffected by the zero  mode interactions ( apart from modifying the statistical ensemble from grand canonical to canonical ) .",
    "the single particle dos is modified in an essential way .",
    "we use imaginary time functional integral to integrate out all fermionic degrees of freedom .",
    "similar methods were used in the context of josephson junctions with dissipative environment ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "non  perturbative treatment reveals the exponential suppression of the dos at the fermi energy .",
    "this result reproduces the classical treatment of the `` orthodox '' theory of the coulomb blockade @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the @xmath0 generalization of the aa zba , and the coulomb blockade , are two limiting cases of the same theory .",
    "this statement is in fact not new . in his original paper ,",
    "@xcite , nazarov had established the connection between the two ( including a non  perturbative treatment of the finite @xmath10 modes ) . a similar , although more transparent , theory has recently been put forward by levitov and shytov @xcite . to a large extent ,",
    "our results can be extracted as the @xmath0 limit of the expressions found in refs .",
    "the point is that refs .",
    "@xcite used some uncontrolled ( although plausible ) approximations .",
    "we have shown that for @xmath12 all calculations may be done exactly , confirming some of the approximations made in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one may combine the zero and finite @xmath10 mode interactions to the zba . in doing",
    "so we take into account the zero mode in an exact fashion and add on top of it the perturbative contribution of the @xmath24 modes . as was mentioned above the latter can be expressed as a regular expansion in powers of @xmath17 valid at any temperature energy and dimensionality . to address the insulating regime",
    "one should consult refs .",
    "@xcite . in the metallic limit",
    "the @xmath24 contribution modifies the dos at high energies ( @xmath25 ) , as a precursor to the coulomb blockade which dominates at lower energies ( cf . fig . [ f4]b ) .",
    "the new ingredient in our analysis is the inclusion of the zero  point ( and thermal ) motion of the electromagnetic environment in contact with the system .",
    "we show that the influence of the environment may lead to a debye screening of the zero ",
    "mode interaction , hence to a softening of the coulomb blockade .",
    "the physics behind the zero  mode screening is the following : the total charge on the dot , @xmath26 , interacts with charges in the environment , leading to their redistribution .",
    "the polarized charge of the environment reduces the energy cost of adding ( or removing ) an electron to ( or from ) the dot .",
    "there is a certain finite time constant ( the @xmath27  constant of the circuit ) , characterizing this redistribution of the environmental charge , rendering the effective interaction in the dot non  instantaneous ( retarded ) .",
    "it might appear that the results obtained through this analysis are highly non  universal and depend on the particular choice of the model for the environment .",
    "we stress , however , that our result expressed by eqs .",
    "( [ gt ] ) and ( [ sscr ] ) is quite general , the only model ",
    "dependent feature is the concrete form of the screened zero ",
    "mode interaction , @xmath28 .",
    "nonuniversality in this sense is unavoidable , due to the long range nature of the coulomb interaction : the behavior of the dot depends on numerous long distance features .",
    "a particularly interesting case is when the zero ",
    "mode interaction is fully screened in the long time limit . by this",
    "we refer to a situation when on a long time scale the addition of an electron to the dot does not cost any energy ( for instance there is a slow continuous leakage of any extra charge from the dot ) . in this case",
    "the usual coulomb gap in the spectrum is absent and one obtains the power ",
    "law zba , very similar to the one known from the physics of luttinger liquid .",
    "the exponent is determined by the time scale of the environment polarization .",
    "this result for a quantum dot coincide with those obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite for a single tunnel junction connected to a linear @xmath29 circuit @xcite . for a quantum dot",
    "one may consider the setup with only partially screened interaction , where the gap in the dos at low energies crosses over to a power ",
    "law zba at larger energies .",
    "let us list several aspects of the problem , which we do not consider here .",
    "although we deal with finite size systems , we do not consider effects related to the discreteness of the single electron spectrum .",
    "it means that the mean level spacing , @xmath30 , is assumed to be the smallest energy scale in our problem .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case of good metals , where @xmath31 .",
    "thus the energy interval of interest , @xmath32 , is wide .",
    "since we are not interested in the single electron spectrum quantization , one may choose any boundary conditions for the electron wave functions .",
    "we prefer to use periodic boundary conditions and employ the momentum representation .",
    "we also stress that our analysis omits the underlaying periodicity of the problem as function of the charge of the positive background ( or of a gate voltage ) which could be manifested as a sequence of coulomb blockade resonances .",
    "instead we restrict ourselves to the case where the background is such that the dot prefers to have an integer charge ( half way between resonances ) .",
    "one can easily generalize the same treatment for any background charge , noting that in the close vicinity of a half  integer ( near a resonance ) a very different treatment , accounting for multiple tunneling events @xcite is required .",
    "in fact even far from resonances multiple tunneling may be important ( e.g `` inelastic co  tunneling '' @xcite ) . for the sake of clarity",
    "we restrict ourselves to a `` golden rule '' scenario , where we consider only lowest order processes in the tunneling amplitude , postponing the consideration of multiple tunneling to a further publication .",
    "the outline of the article is as follows . in section [ s2 ]",
    "we recall the derivation of the zba given by aa and extend it to @xmath0 .",
    "the non  perturbative treatment of zero - mode interaction is discussed in section [ s3 ] , where we study in some details the case of an instantaneous zero  mode interaction and rederive the results of the `` orthodox '' coulomb blockade .",
