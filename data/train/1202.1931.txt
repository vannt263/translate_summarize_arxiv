    "based on this proof a constructive method was suggested in @xcite for the solution of the inverse scattering problem at fixed energy .    in this paper",

    "one way to overcome the difficulties would be to reduce the number of bound states and to leave the nonlinear regime .",

    "with such a prescription we have reproduced known potentials .",
    "another ( or simultaneous ) prescription can be to check the inverse potential whether it fulfills the approximate relation @xmath231 . with this prescription we have got the inverse potentials equivalent to the measured phase shifts of @xmath232 and @xmath217 scattering experiments .",

    "the ha method can be extended into various directions .",
    "a natural extension is to develop the theory to handle complex phase shifts which describe inelastic processes .",
    "another extension would be to efficiently treat coulombic processes , i.e. charged particle scattering .",
