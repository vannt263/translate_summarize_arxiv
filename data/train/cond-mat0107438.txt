    "the investigation of acoustic propagation in a fluid - saturated porous media provides opportunities to study disordered pore structures , as well as the properties of the fluids confined in the pores . in [ 1 ] biot developed a simple theory of propagation of elastic waves in statistically homogeneous and isotropic porous media saturated with a ( one - component ) compressional fluid assuming that pore sizes are smaller compared to the wavelength i.e. the long wavelength limit is considered .",
    "biot s theory predicts one shear wave and two longitudinal , fast and slow compressional waves .",
    "the fast compressional wave corresponds to solid and fluid moving in phase , and the slow one corresponds to solid and fluid moving in opposite phase .",
    "the biot s theory was experimentally confirmed by the observation of the fast and slow compressional wave in glass bead samples filled with water[2 ] .",
    "because of the unique properties of liquid helium [ 3 ] , it is of fundamental importance to investigate the sound propagation in superfluid - filled porous media . below the @xmath1-transition temperature @xmath2 ,",
    "liquid @xmath3he becomes a superfluid and behaves as a `` mixture '' of a normal(viscous ) component with mass density @xmath4 and a superfluid ( zero - viscosity ) component with mass density @xmath5 ; it is clear that @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the mass density of superfluid @xmath3he(so - called he ii ) .",
    "it must be pointed out that the superfluid component and the normal component can not be physically separated [ 3 ] .",
    "the normal ( superfluid ) component fraction increases(decreases ) monotonously from @xmath8(@xmath9 ) at @xmath10 to @xmath11(@xmath12 ) at and above @xmath13 .",
    "it is important that @xmath4 and @xmath5 can move independently , and therefore in bulk he ii the two mode of sound propagation are possible . in first sound",
    "the two fluid components oscillate in phase ; and in second sound @xmath5 and @xmath4 oscillate in opposite phase .",
    "one of the most interesting property of he ii is fourth sound mode . in fourth",
    "sound only the superfluid component moves , when the normal fluid component is locked inside a rigid porous medium by viscous forces , so that its velocity is identically zero .",
    "since a superfluid - filled porous medium is really a three - component system , biot s theory is not applicable directly to this system .",
    "but , at low temperatures ( @xmath14 ) , when the normal fluid component fraction may be neglected , johnson has shown that fourth sound mode is exactly a biot s slow wave [ 4 ] .",
    "it should be noted that at low temperatures , when the mean free path of phonons and rotons becomes larger than the pore size the hydrodynamical description breaks down , so the comparison to biot s model should be made at higher temperatures [ 5 ] .",
    "we have to point out that a number of authors extended biot s theory in the case of two or more fluids ( for review see [ 6],[7 ] ) .",
    "since the fluids usually considered are not superfluids , the authors neglected some effects , which are actually important in the case of superfluids .",
    "indeed , it is well known that in the case of ordinary fluids the fountain(and / or mechano - caloric ) effect is negligible , however , in the case of a superfluid these effects are crucial .",
    "in particular , a temperature gradient produces relative motion between the two fluids in superfluids [ 3 ] .",
    "therefore we have to distinguish between pressures with a `` mechanical origin '' and those with a `` thermal origin '' , the later can only be found in superfluids [ 3 ] whereas the former can appear in any fluid .",
    "moreover , it is important that the superfluid component and the normal component can not be physically separated .",
    "actually he ii is the fluid with additional degrees of freedom [ 3 ] , but not a real mixture of two fluids .    in this paper the generalization of biot s theory is given in the case of superfluid - saturated porous media , when all damping processes are neglected .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we apply biot formalism to bulk he ii and derive some equations , which are used in section iv . section iii and section iv give a derivation of the equations which describe the propagation of longitudinal and shear waves in a superfluid - saturated , homogeneous and isotropic porous media .",
    "this is the main result of this paper . in section",
    "v the formalism is applied to the most important particular case when the normal fluid component is locked inside a porous media by viscous forces . finally , in section vi we discuss some limits of our equations and summarize results .",
    "in this section we apply formalism developed by biot [ 1],[8 ] to the wave processes in bulk he ii .",
    "the wave processes in bulk he ii is well understood [ 3 ] , but biot s formalism has the advantage that it can be generalized easily for three - component systems . besides , in this section we derive some equations which are used later .",
    "the basic idea is to describe the wave processes in he ii in terms of `` elastic deformations '' of the superfluid and the normal components of he ii . in this formalism the pressure with a `` thermal origin '' have to be considered as an `` elastic '' restore force as well as the pressure with a `` mechanical origin '' . here",
    "we present the key points of calculations , for more discussion of details of the formalism the reader is referred to [ 1],[8 ] .",
    "let us define the displacement of the superfluid and the normal components as @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively .",
    "then the displacement @xmath17 of he ii is [ 3 ] :    @xmath18    following [ 1 ] we choose the lagrangian coordinates of the system as the six displacement components @xmath19 of he ii .",
    "note that in contrast with ref.[1 ] no averaging procedure is required here .",
    "then the kinetic energy @xmath20 of the unit volume of he ii is presented as :    @xmath21 ^ 2+\\rho_s\\left[\\frac{\\partial u_{si}}{\\partial t}\\right]^2\\right);\\ ] ]    here we take into account that the superfluid component and the normal component move independently .",
    "so the mass coupling parameter between the normal component and the superfluid component equals zero [ 1 ] .",
    "let us assume that the system is in equilibrium being at rest .",
    "therefore , any displacement is a deviation from a state of minimum potential energy .",
    "then the potential energy @xmath22 per unit volume of he ii is [ 1],[9 ] : @xmath23 here we take into account that the shear modulus of he ii is zero .",
    "we formally separate the stress of the normal component @xmath24 and the stress of the superfluid component @xmath25 ( see section iii as well ) ; they describe the pressure with a `` thermal origin '' as well as the pressure with a \" mechanical origin  .",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 are the strain in the normal and the superfluid components of he ii respectively . from ( 1 ) the strain in the fluid @xmath28",
    "is given by : @xmath29    when there is no ( nonuniform ) relative motion between the superfluid and the normal components then @xmath30 and no temperature gradients exist ( see the text after equation ( 16 ) ) .",
    "in this case the dynamics of the system is described by the theory of elasticity .",
    "but when @xmath31 temperature gradients exist and the fountain and/or mechano - caloric effect takes place ( see the text after equation ( 16 ) ) .",
    "we show in this section that in this case the formalism of theory of elasticity is applicable as well .    in the first approximation",
    "the stress components are linear functions of the strain components , so one gets [ 1 ] : @xmath32 @xmath33 and @xmath34 describe \" elastic properties  of the superfluid and the normal components , and @xmath35 describes the `` elastic interaction '' between them [ 1 ] .    to make results more useful let us express @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 in terms of directly measurable coefficients [ 8 ] .",
    "let us now consider a volume of he ii in a vessel .",
    "first we consider the case , when none of the fluid components is allowed to escape from vessel .",
    "we shall refer to this case as `` unjacketed compressibility test''(see section iii ) .",
    "if a pressure @xmath36 is applied to he ii ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , no relative motion between the superfluid component and the normal component takes place , i.e. : @xmath37    so , in this case temperature difference does not exist .",
    "fluid pressure has only `` mechanical origin '' and we have [ 8 ] : @xmath38 so , from ( 5 ) and ( 7 ) we get : @xmath39    besides , in this case we have : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the adiabatic bulk modulus of he ii .    using ( 9 ) from ( 8) we get ( recall that @xmath42 , in this case ) : @xmath43",
    "now we consider another case , when the superfluid component is allowed to escape through a superleak , but not the normal fluid component ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . we shall refer to this case as `` second jacketed compressibility test '' ( see section iii ) .",
    "if a pressure @xmath36 is applied to he ii , the superfluid component passes through the superleak into the reservoir of he ii .",
    "an applied external pressure squeeze out some of the superfluid component , this means that temperature increases in a vessel .",
    "so , a temperature difference between the vessel and the reservoir of he ii exists .",
    "as it is well known , temperature difference between the two volumes of he ii is accompanied by a pressure difference between these volumes ( fountain or / and mechano - caloric effect)[3 ] . since the superfluid component is allowed to pass through the superleak , its partial pressure is zero .",
    "but the normal fluid component is identified with the thermal excitations of he ii ( gas of phonons and rotons ) and its partial pressure is not zero .",
    "thus , if we neglect the thermal expansion coefficient of he ii ( which is anomalously small ) , we can conclude that fluid pressure in this case has only `` thermal origin '' .",
    "it is clear that the normal fluid component pressure equals to the external pressure ( let us define it in this case by @xmath44 ) , and we have : @xmath45 or using ( 5 ) and ( 11 ) : @xmath46    let us define the bulk modulus of the normal fluid component @xmath47 as : @xmath48 since the superfluid component and the normal component can not be physically separated , the definition of the bulk modulus of the normal fluid component is formal . but let us point out that @xmath47 does not enter into final equations ( 18 ) , ( 19 ) ; so this problem is irrelevant in this case .    from ( 13 ) and",
    "( 12 ) we have :    @xmath49    besides , in this case the energy conservation law gives : @xmath50 where @xmath51 represents the fluid volume entering through the superleak [ 8 ] .",
    "@xmath52 and @xmath53 are the specific heat and the entropy per unit mass of he ii , respectively .",
    "@xmath54 is the difference between the temperature of the fluid inside a vessel and the temperature of the reservoir of he ii caused by external pressure [ 3 ] : @xmath55 one can see from ( 15 ) that @xmath56 when @xmath57 , so pressure has only a `` mechanical origin '' .",
    "but when @xmath31 from ( 15 ) one gets that @xmath58 , therefore temperature gradients exist .    from ( 15 ) using the first equation in ( 12 ) we can eliminate @xmath59 and @xmath60 , and we get the following expression for @xmath47 : @xmath61 here we have used ( 10 ) , ( 14 ) , ( 16 ) and definition ( 13 ) as well .    from (",
    "10 ) and ( 14 ) using ( 17 ) we directly get : @xmath62    equation ( 18 ) gives @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 in terms of directly measurable coefficients .",
    "these relations are used in section iv .",
    "now , to demonstrate the correctness of the expressions obtained above let us calculate the velocity of sound propagation in he ii .    using ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 5 ) from lagrange s equations one derives the equations for the wave propagation in he ii [ 1 ] : @xmath63 solutions of ( 19 ) with @xmath64 wave vector have the form : @xmath65;\\nonumber\\\\ \\epsilon_n&=&c_n \\exp[i\\vec k(\\vec r+\\vec vt)];\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath66 and @xmath67 are real constants , and @xmath68 is the velocity of the wave .    substituting ( 20 ) into ( 19 ) we find that there are two modes of longitudinal waves the fast and the slow waves with velocities @xmath69 and @xmath70 respectively .",
    "using ( 18 ) we get the expressions for @xmath69 and @xmath70 : @xmath71 the fast wave corresponds to the superfluid component and the normal component moving in phase ; from ( 19 ) one can see that in the case of fast wave @xmath72 [ 1 ] .",
    "this means that @xmath30 , so no fountain(and / or mechano - caloric ) effect takes place and only the pressure with a `` mechanical origin '' appear .",
    "this is a ordinary wave in an ordinary fluid ( see also section v ) .",
    "the slow wave corresponds to the superfluid and the normal components moving in opposite phase . in the case of slow wave ( 19 )",
    "gives that @xmath73 [ 1 ] .",
    "thus @xmath74 and pressure with a `` mechanical origin '' does not appear ; but @xmath31 , thus temperature oscillations exist .",
    "this is a temperature wave which appear only in superfluids ( see also section v ) .",
    "these are well known results of landau s theory of sound propagation in he ii [ 3 ] .",
    "therefore , we have shown that the formalism developed by biot [ 1 ] may be applied to the wave processes in he ii .",
    "besides , we conclude that bulk he ii may be regarded as a fluid - saturated porous media with porosity @xmath75 .",
    "the normal fluid component plays the role of the solid part with @xmath47 bulk modulus and zero shear modulus , and the superfluid component plays the role of the fluid .",
    "equation ( 21 ) shows that second sound is exactly slow wave mode .",
    "in this section we will derive the general equations which govern the propagation of longitudinal and shear waves in a superfluid - saturated , homogeneous and isotropic porous media .",
    "let us consider a unit cube of superfluid - filled , macroscopically homogeneous and isotropic porous solid as an element .",
    "the element is assumed to be large as compared to pore sizes , but small compared to a wavelength . in this case , the element is described by the average displacement of the normal fluid component @xmath76 , the superfluid component @xmath77 , and the solid @xmath78 parts .    following [ 1 ] ,",
    "let us introduce the lagrangian viewpoint and the concept of generalized coordinates .",
    "the lagrangian coordinates are chosen as the nine average displacement components of both the solid and the fluid i.e. @xmath79    the kinetic energy @xmath80 of the system per unit volume is [ 1 ] : @xmath81 ^ 2 + \\rho_{22}^s\\left[\\frac{\\partial u_{si}}{\\partial t}\\right]^2 + \\rho_{22}^n\\left[\\frac{\\partial u_{ni}}{\\partial t}\\right]^2+\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left.2\\rho_{12}^s\\left[\\frac{\\partial u_{i}}{\\partial t}\\frac{\\partial u_{si}}{\\partial t}\\right]+ 2\\rho_{12}^n\\left[\\frac{\\partial u_{i}}{\\partial t}\\frac{\\partial u_{ni}}{\\partial t}\\right]\\right);\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we take into account that the directions @xmath82 are equivalent and uncoupled dynamically .",
    "we can express @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 in terms of directly measurable coefficients .",
    "calculations quite similar to [ 1 ] for @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath88 density coefficients give ( see also [ 4 ] ) : @xmath89 from ( 23 ) one can calculate @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 using the directly measurable coefficients . @xmath90 is the porosity(fluid volume fraction ) ; @xmath91 is the density of the solid ; @xmath92 is a purely geometrical quantity independent of solid and fluid densities ; @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the index of refraction [ 4 ] .    the @xmath95 coefficient represents a mass coupling parameter between the solid and the superfluid(normal ) components . as @xmath96 and @xmath97 can move independently , the mass coupling parameter between the superfluid and the normal components is identically zero .",
    "let us assume that system is in equilibrium being at rest , therefore any displacement is a deviation from a state of minimum potential energy",
    ". then the potential energy @xmath98 per unit volume of the system is given by [ 1 ] : @xmath99 here , the generalized procedure of the classical theory of elasticity has been used [ 9 ] .",
    "@xmath98 is expressed in terms of the strain and stress components .",
    "the stress tensor in the porous material is : @xmath100 @xmath101 components of the stress tensor are the forces applied to the portion of the cube faces occupied by the solid .",
    "note , that the fraction of solid area per unit cross section is @xmath102 [ 1 ] . in stress",

    "the fraction of the fluid area per unit cross section is @xmath90 .",
    "the strain tensor in the solid is : @xmath108 with @xmath109 etc . and @xmath110 etc .",
    "in the first approximation the stress components are linear functions of the strain components .",
    "the stress - strain relations for superfluid - filled , statistically isotropic porous media can be expressed as [ 1 ] : @xmath111 where @xmath112    note that , because of ( 25 ) describes elastic properties of coupled system of the porous solid and he ii , the coefficients @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 differ from @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "but the relations derived in section ii are still satisfied .",
    "indeed , it is clear that one can consider porous solid as a vessel .",
    "so , we can identify `` unjacketed compressibility test '' and `` second compressibility test '' in section ii with the unjacketed compressibility test and the second jacketed compressibility test considered in the next section respectively . in section",
    "iv we use some of the relations derived in section ii .",
    "it should be pointed out that thermodynamic parameters of he ii in the porous media and the ones of bulk he ii may differ from each other ( @xmath4 for example ) [ 3 ] .",
    "the thermal expansion coefficient of he ii is too small and we can neglect it . besides , we neglect the heat exchange between the solid and he ii . this is a reasonable assumption if the wave frequency is not too small . under this assumptions",
    "it is clear that between the solid and he ii forces caused by temperature gradients do not exist .",
    "so , forces between the solid and he ii have `` mechanical origin '' .",

    "8 temperature oscillations amplitudes for fast and slow waves as a function of temperature are presented for porosities 0.7 , 0.98 and 0.99 respectively ( see section vi for discussion ) .",
    "we see that @xmath182 is positive in fig .",
    "6 , but is negative in fig . 7 and fig .",
    "it is interesting that , in contrast with bulk he ii ( see section ii ) , even for fast wave @xmath183 [ 1 ] in general .",
    "so , fast wave as well as slow wave is accompanied by temperature oscillations in general . in the case of bulk",
    "he ii , when @xmath127 and @xmath128 , equation ( 52 ) gives that @xmath184 ; so temperature oscillations do not accompany first sound , as we have expected ( see section ii ) .",
    "let us now consider equations ( 47 ) for the shear waves . from ( 47 )",
    "it is easy to see that there is only one type of shear wave [ 1 ] .",

    "note that , as @xmath187 , the rotation of the solid with locked normal fluid component @xmath188 is coupled to the rotation of the superfluid component @xmath189 according to the relation @xmath190 and therefore , @xmath191 [ 1 ] .",
    "equation ( 54 ) shows that the rotation of the solid with locked normal fluid component and the superfluid component are in the same direction .",
    "equations ( 50 ) and ( 53 ) give the velocities of propagation of longitudinal and shear waves in a superfluid - saturated porous media , when the normal fluid component is locked inside the porous solid .",
    "if @xmath192 and @xmath130 will be measured , then one can determine the velocities of propagation of fast , slow and shear waves from ( 50 ) and ( 53 ) .",
    "it should be noted that equations ( 50 ) and ( 53 ) differ from the equations obtained by biot [ 1 ] and contain significant new physics .",
    "indeed , biot s results do not contain forces caused by temperature gradients .",
    "in fact , in the case of superfluid - filled porous media biot s results are not valid .",
    "johnson [ 4 ] has shown that in the rigid frame at low temperatures ( @xmath14 ) fourth sound is exactly biot s slow wave .",
    "however , at low temperatures the hydrodynamical description breaks down [ 3 ] and comparison to biot s model should be made at higher temperatures [ 5 ] .",
    "so , we conclude that in all physically interesting cases biot s equations are not applicable to superfluid - filled porous media .",
    "examples of physical systems to which equations ( 50 ) and ( 53 ) can be applied are superleak of porous vycor glass and high - porosity aerogels ( e.g. silica aerogels with porosities @xmath193 ) .",
    "superleak of porous vycor glass corresponds to a superfluid - solid system in the rigid frame limit ( @xmath194 ) .",
    "the most interesting physical system , high - porosity aerogel , corresponds to a superfluid - solid system in the weak frame limit(@xmath195 ) .",
    "now , let us discuss the results obtained in the previous sections . in section iii and section iv we derived the general equations ( 28),(29 ) .",
    "these equations describe the propagation of longitudinal and shear wave in a superfluid - saturated porous media when all damping processes are neglected .",
    "equations ( 28 ) and ( 29 ) depend explicitly on the directly measurable parameters of the porous solid and he ii via relations ( 23 ) and ( 44 ) . equations ( 28 ) , ( 29 ) and ( 23 ) , ( 44 ) reduce to the equations obtained by biot [ 1],[8 ] when @xmath12 or @xmath8 .",
    "besides , when @xmath196 these equations describe the sound propagation in bulk he ii . from what one concludes that these equations reduce correctly to biot s theory [ 1 ] and landau s theory of sound propagation in bulk he ii [ 3 ] .    in section",
    "v , we considered the case when the normal fluid component is locked inside a porous media by viscous forces .",
    "it is shown that in this case one shear wave and two longitudinal , fast and slow , waves exist .",
    "the velocities of these waves @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath185 are obtained .    since equations ( 46 ) and",
    "( 47 ) include pressures caused by thermal gradients , they are more general in comparison with equations derived by biot . the only case when ( 46 ) and ( 47 ) reduce to the biot s equations is @xmath8 ( see also section v ) .    using ( 50 ) , ( 52 ) and ( 53 ) we have plotted the examples of the wave velocities and temperature oscillations amplitudes for fast and slow waves as a function of temperature . in fig . 6 , fig . 7 and fig .",
    "8 the plots are presented for porosities 0.7 , 0.98 and 0.99 respectively .",
    "the bulk modulus and the mass density of the solid we choose arbitrarily as @xmath197 and @xmath198 . for the bulk modulus of the skeletal frame @xmath140 we have used the following relation @xmath199 [ 10 ] .",

    "when the porosity is not small @xmath92 is given by @xmath202 [ 4 ] .",
    "in the present paper the parameters of bulk he ii [ 11 ] are used for numerical estimations .",
    "but we note that the thermodynamic parameters of heii in the porous media and the ones of bulk heii may differ from each other ( @xmath4 for example ) [ 3 ] .",
    "figure 6 shows the behaviour of the fast , slow and shear wave velocities as a function of temperature for porosity @xmath203 .",
    "moreover , the temperature oscillations amplitudes for fast and slow waves @xmath204 and @xmath205 are presented as well . in this paper",
    "we have assumed that the temperature oscillations amplitude is about @xmath206 , so for @xmath207 and @xmath208 we choose @xmath209 and @xmath210 .",
    "the plots presented in fig .",
    "6 are typical for @xmath211 . for these porosities @xmath212",
    "; so we have a superfluid - solid system in the rigid frame limit . in this limit",
    "the fast wave and shear wave velocities decrease when porosity increases .",
    "besides , the slow wave mode is exactly fourth sound . we can show this even analytically .    in the limit of the rigid frame the expressions ( 50 ) for the fast and slow wave",
    "are greatly simplified . in this case",
    "@xmath194 and therefore @xmath213;\\nonumber\\\\ v_s^2&=&\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\left(\\frac{\\rho_s}{\\rho_h}v_1 ^ 2 + \\frac{\\rho_n}{\\rho_h}v_2 ^ 2\\right);\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath69 and @xmath70 are given by ( 21 ) .",
    "the slow wave corresponds only to the oscillation of the superfluid component ( rigid frame ) and @xmath169 is the well - known velocity of fourth sound [ 3 ] renormalized by the tortuous , branching path of pore space [ 4 ] ; i.e. fourth sound is exactly biot s slow mode .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "6 that in the fast wave mode @xmath216 in the limit of rigid frame . in the slow wave mode always @xmath217 ( see fig .",
    "7 and fig . 8) .",
    "in addition let us note that , in contrast with @xmath168 and @xmath185 , slow wave velocity @xmath169 does not depend on @xmath91 , @xmath140 and @xmath130 .    in fig .",
    "7 and fig .",
    "8 we present behaviour of the fast , slow and shear wave velocities as a function of temperature for porosities @xmath218 and @xmath219 respectively .",
    "moreover , the temperature oscillations amplitudes for fast and slow waves @xmath204 and @xmath205 are presented as well .",

    "; so we have a superfluid - solid system in the weak frame limit . in this limit ,",
    "in contrast with @xmath211 ( rigid frame ) , the slow wave velocity @xmath169 depends on @xmath91 , @xmath140 and @xmath130 .      in fig .",
    "8 we see that the behaviour of @xmath169 near @xmath13 is almost the same as in fig . 7 .",
    "but at low temperatures @xmath169 becomes considerably less than second sound velocity . for porosities",
    "@xmath223 slow wave velocity @xmath169 increases smoothly when @xmath90 increases ; and when porosity reaches @xmath127 the slow wave mode is exactly second sound .",
    "fast wave velocity @xmath168 decreases when the porosity increases for @xmath224 ( it becomes even less than first sound velocity ) ; and @xmath168 increases when the porosity increases for @xmath225 . in fig .",
    "7 and fig .",
    "8 @xmath168 is less than first sound velocity .",
    "for @xmath127 fast wave is exactly first sound .",
    "the shear wave mode velocity @xmath185 decreases when the porosity increases .",
    "note that in fig . 7 and fig .",
    "8 @xmath185 is less than @xmath169 .",
    "for @xmath127 the shear wave velocity is zero .    from fig .",
    "7 and fig .",
    "8 we can see that in the fast wave mode @xmath226 in the limit of weak frame . when porosity is exactly @xmath127 ( the case of bulk he ii ) , the temperature oscillations amplitude in the fast wave mode is zero ( also see section v ) .",
    "the limit of weak frame is the most interesting and important application of our theory .",
    "indeed , in recent years the investigation of the behaviour of superfluids in aerogels has attached increasing attention ( for example , see [ 12],[13],[14 ] ) .",
    "aerogels are highly open porous solids with porosities @xmath193 ( e.g. silica aerogels ) .",
    "the mean pore diameter in aerogels is about @xmath227 , so the normal fluid component is clamped in the frame by viscous forces .",
    "besides , high - porosity aerogels have very small bulk and shear modulus and are highly compliant .",
    "that is why in the superfluid - filled aerogels pressures caused by thermal gradients play a crucial role , in contrast to other porous solids .",
    "thus , one should describe wave processes in high - porosity aerogels using equations ( 46 ) and ( 47 ) .",
    "we point out that the theory of sound propagation in aerogels has been developed in ref.[12 ] .",
    "these authors modified the conventional two fluid hydrodynamic equations and derived an expression ( see equation ( 8) in ref.[12 ] ) which gives the longitudinal wave velocity in superfluid - filled aerogels , but does not give the shear wave velocity .",
    "it must be noted that equation ( 8) in ref.[12 ] is incorrect . to show this we remark the following .    the longitudinal wave velocity in any solid ( in aerogel in the case of ref.[12 ] )",
    "is given by @xmath228^{1/2};$ ] [ 15 ] .",
    "here @xmath229 , @xmath230 and @xmath231 are the bulk modulus , the shear modulus and the mass density of the solid , respectively . in [ 12 ] the term @xmath232 is omitted ( see the equation ( 5 ) in ref.[12 ] ) .",
    "this is justified if @xmath233 . in the case of aerogels",
    "poisson s ratio equals @xmath234 and is independent of density [ 16],[10 ] .",
    "this means that @xmath235 and the term @xmath232 in the longitudinal wave velocity is not negligible .",
    "besides , in the limit @xmath236 equation ( 8) in ref.[12 ] suggests that in the superfluid - filled porous media one of the modes of sound propagates with velocity @xmath237 , where @xmath237 is given by equation ( 5 ) in ref.[12 ] , which is incorrect ( see [ 15 ] ) .    in conclusion , we have derived the general equations which describe the propagation of longitudinal and shear waves in a superfluid - filled , homogeneous and isotropic porous media in the long wavelength limit when all damping processes are neglected .",
    "the most important case when the normal fluid component is locked inside a porous media by viscous forces is investigated in detail .",
    "it is shown that , in this case , one type of shear wave and two types of longitudinal , fast and slow wave , propagation are possible .",
    "the velocities of these waves are obtained .",
    "our results reduce to the well - known equations in the appropriate limits .",
    "we have also demonstrated that the formalism developed by biot may be applied to the wave processes in he ii .",
    "it is shown that fourth sound , as well as second sound in bulk he ii is exactly biot s slow wave .",
    "in addition , we remark that the results derived in this paper may be applied to the porous media saturated with superfluid @xmath238he as well .",
