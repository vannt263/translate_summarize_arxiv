    "with the advent of next generation radioactive beam facilities isospin asymmetric nuclear matter claims much attention in contemporary nuclear physics . at those facilities we could create terrestrial environment to study dense matter with a large neutron or proton excess through nuclear reactions with radioactive nuclei .    studying nuclear matter",
    "is also important to understand the structure of neutron stars  @xcite . in 2010 and 2013 , two neutron stars with twice solar mass were found  @xcite and many models yielding the soft equation of states ( eos ) were excluded .",
    "neutron stars offer very cold and asymmetric dense environment and may have hyperons in the core of the stars .",
    "if there are hyperonic degrees of freedom , it is expected that the eos becomes softer and neutron star mass becomes lighter .",
    "another important astrophysical site for nuclear matter is a hybrid star whose center has quark matter @xcite .",
    "the properties of asymmetric matter have been investigated in various approaches  @xcite .",
    "very recently liquid - gas and chiral phase transition are studied in a parity doublet model with a six - point scalar interaction in which mesonic fluctuations are included by means of the functional renormalization group  @xcite . in this work",
    "we study isospin asymmetric dense matter in the framework of the parity doublet model ( mirror assignment )  @xcite .",
    "the properties of symmetric dense matter such as chiral phase transition were extensively studied in the parity doublet models at zero or finite temperature  @xcite .",
    "we extend the parity doublet model by including @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons through the hidden local symmetry and also by adding a six - point interaction of a scalar meson . here , as a first step , we will not consider hyperonic matter and work within the mean field approximation .",
    "we determine our model parameters , except the chiral invariant mass ( @xmath3 ) , by performing global fitting to physical inputs ( masses and pion decay constant in free space and nuclear matter properties ) .",
    "we then study the equation of state and the phase diagram of dense matter at finite temperature .",
    "we find that the predicted slope parameter at the saturation density meets the constraint from heavy ion experiments and neutron star observations ( see , e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) and observe that the chiral condensate drops at the chiral and liquid - gas transition points .",
    "it is also seen that smaller @xmath3 values prefer smaller critical densities for chiral phase transition .",
    "the study of asymmetric matter reveals that the first order nature of the liquid - gas transition disappears in asymmetric matter and the critical densities for the chiral transition become smaller with increasing asymmetries , which are consistent with previous studies .    in section [ model ]",
    "we extend the parity doublet model , and in section [ parameterf ] we fix the model parameters . our results on bulk properties of nuclear matter and density dependence of chiral condensate and nucleon mass are given in section [ eos ] .",
    "we present the phase diagram of dense ( asymmetric ) matter in section [ phased ] .",
    "finally , conclusion and discussion follow in section [ sd ]",
    "we construct a chiral effective model based on the parity doublet model  @xcite , in which a nucleon with positive parity is regarded as a chiral partner to the one with negative parity and they belong to the same multiplet .",
