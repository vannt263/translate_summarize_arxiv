    "all pulsars lose energy through a wind of relativistic particles .",
    "this relativistic wind has long been recognized to shock against the ambient medium , giving rise to `` nebulae '' powered by the pulsars , which usually emit at x - ray and radio wavelengths .",
    "it can be expected that all pulsars will be surrounded by such nebulae , usually powered by the pulsar rotational energy .",
    "the brightness and shapes of these nebulae depend on the pulsar properties , on the ambient medium density and anisotropies , and on the pulsar proper motion . in the most idealized case ,",
    "an isotropic wind would form a spherical termination shock ( kennel & coroniti 1984 ) .",
    "the superb angular resolution of _ chandra _ has resulted in the detection of roughly 50 nebulae , and has shown that this idealized description is not sufficient to describe most of their structures ( gaensler & slane 2006 ; kargaltsev & pavlov 2008 ) . in general , these nebulae are anisotropic , show equatorial and polar outflows , and have rich spectral structures .",
    "most of the nebulae detected thus far are associated with pulsars with high spin - down energy loss rates ( @xmath3ergs ) , the so called spin - down powered pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) , but there are a few cases where a nebula is observed but no pulsar is detected . the exact physical origin and acceleration mechanism of the high - energy particles in the pulsar winds",
    "are poorly understood , and not all nebulae can be easily explained as spin - down powered pwne .    rotating radio transients ( rrats )",
    "are peculiar neutron stars which , unlike normal radio pulsars , are detectable only through their sporadic radio bursts ( mclaughlin et al . 2006 ) .",
    "we currently know of over 20 of these objects ( deneva et al .",
    "2008 ; keane et al .",
    "2009 ) ; they show a rather broad range of spin - down properties , with inferred surface dipole magnetic field strengths ranging from @xmath4  g and characteristic ages ranging from 0.14  myr .",
    "no sign of a companion star has yet been found for any of these objects .",
    "shows the most extreme and varied phenomenology of all the rrats , and is the best studied object in the class .",
    "radio bursts are detected every @xmath03  minutes , and two glitches have been observed which showed anomalous post - glitch recovery ( lyne et al .",
    "2009 ) . has a 4.3s spin period , a characteristic age of 117  kyr and a spin - down energy loss rate @xmath5 of @xmath6 .",
    "the inferred surface dipolar magnetic field of @xmath7 g is slightly higher than the electron critical magnetic field of @xmath8 g , suggesting a possible relationship with magnetars . by using the dispersion measure and the cordes & lazio ( 2002 ) electron density model , the distance of",
    "is estimated to be 3.6  kpc .",
    "furthermore , it is the only rrat for which an x  ray counterpart has been discovered ( reynolds et al .  2006 ;",
    "mclaughlin et al .  2007 ;",
    "see also rea & mclaughlin 2008 for other non - detections ) .",
    "after the serendipitous _ chandra _ discovery of its x - ray emission , we performed a 43ks _ xmm  newton _ observation in mid-2006 ( mclaughlin et al .",
    "this observation resulted in the detection of strong x  ray pulsations at the radio period , with a @xmath034% pulsed fraction , and a sinusoidal x - ray pulse profile aligned in phase with the radio bursts .",
    "this observation also showed that the spectrum was well modeled by an absorbed blackbody ( @xmath92 , @xmath10kev , using anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) solar abundances ) and a hint of a power - law component with @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , a broad spectral absorption line at @xmath01kev was discovered , and interpreted as either due to resonant cyclotron scattering , to the neutron star atmosphere , or ( less likely ) to an overabundance of ne along the line of sight .",
    "the unabsorbed flux is @xmath122 ( 0.35  kev ) .",
    "this converts to an x - ray luminosity of @xmath13 , more than one order of magnitude higher than the spin - down luminosity .",
    "unfortunately , the _ xmm  newton _ observation lacked the angular resolution to place meaningful constraints on small - scale extended emission .",
    "we present here the results of a new _ chandra _ observation of .",
    "the observation and data reduction are reported in  [ obs ] , the analysis and results in  [ results ] , and a discussion in  [ discussion ] .",
    "the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory observed for @xmath030ks with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) instrument on 2008 may 31 ( obsid7645 ) from 13:33:47 to 22:27:04 ( ut ) in very faint ( vf ) timed exposure imaging mode .",
    "we used a 1/8 subarray , which provides a time resolution of 0.4s , and the typical acis - s imaging and spectral information .",
    "the source was positioned in the back - illuminated acis - s3 ccd at the nominal target position .",
    "standard processing of the data was performed by the _",
    "chandra _ x - ray center to level 1 and level 2 ( processing software ds 7.6.11.6 ) .",
    "the data were reprocessed using the ciao software ( version 4.0 ) .",
    "we used the latest acis gain map , and applied the time - dependent gain and charge transfer inefficiency corrections .",
    "the data were then filtered for bad event grades and only good time intervals were used .",
    "no high background events were detected , resulting in a final exposure time of 27.88ks .",
    "we applied the wavedetect tool to the acis - s cleaned image , and found two x - ray bright stars in the field detected at a significance of @xmath14 : at ra=18:19:34.173 and dec=14:58:03.57 ( j2000 ) , and another source at ra=18:19:32.36 and dec=14:57:58.67 ( j2000 ) , with statistical error circles of 0.01and 0.18 radii , respectively ( see also fig.1 ; all uncertainties in the text are reported at a 1@xmath15 confidence level ) .",
    "the latter source is consistent with the 2mass star 181932331457584 , which has a position of ra=18:19:32.34 , dec=14:57:58.5 ( with an accuracy of 0.08 radius ) .",
    "we could then perform a bore - site correction of the field to refine the position and error circle .",
    "there were no problems with the aspect solution during the observation .",
    "in particular , the 2mass position of the source lies within the statistical 1@xmath15 uncertainty of the serendipitous x - ray source , and that the next 2mass source is 8 away . assuming that the association between the 2mass star and the serendipitous x - ray source is sound , the final position is ra=18:19:34.173 and dec=14:58:03.57 , with a 1@xmath15 associated error circle of 0.28 radius ( derived doing a quadratic mean of all statistical errors plus the 2mass catalogue intrinsic systematic error ) .",
    "this is the most accurate position for , reported thus far , more accurate than that achievable through radio timing ( lyne et al .",
    "2009 ) .      for the timing and spectral analysis we extracted the source photons from a circular region with 2.5 radius .",
    "circular background regions of radii 2.5 and 18 , far from the source , were used for the timing and spectral analysis , respectively .",
    "has an acis - s 0.310kev count rate of @xmath16 counts / s ( background subtracted ) .    for the timing analysis we corrected the arrival time of each photon to the barycenter of the solar system ( using the jpl - de405 ephemeris ) . using the xrons package , we folded the x - ray data with the radio ephemeris ( lyne et al .",
    "2009 ) , revealing a sinusoidal x - ray modulation with a 0.35kev pulsed fraction of 37@xmath173% , defined as @xmath18 , with @xmath19 and @xmath20 the maximum and minimum counts of the x - ray pulse profile .",
    "the source spectrum was rebinned so as to have at least 25 counts per spectral bin .",
    "we modeled the spectrum using the xspec v.12.1 analysis package .",
    "we tried several single component continuum models .",
    "the best fit was found with an absorbed blackbody plus an absorption line which we modeled with a gaussian function .",
    "our best fit values are : @xmath212 and @xmath22kev for the continuum , and e@xmath23kev , @xmath24kev , and an equivalent width eqw@xmath25ev for the absorption line ( @xmath26 ( 29 dof ) ; see fig .  2 left panel ) .",
    "the 0.35kev absorbed flux is @xmath272 , while the inferred blackbody radius is @xmath28 km ( assuming a 3.6kpc distance ) , smaller than the whole neutron star surface , in accordance with the relatively high pulsed fraction of this x - ray emission .",
    "the pulse profile shape , pulsed fraction , spectral parameters , and flux are all consistent , within the errors , with past measurements ( reynolds et al .",
    "2006 ; mclaughlin et al .",
    "2007 ) . therefore",
    ", this new _ chandra _ observation did not provide any evidence for long term variability .",
    "likewise , no bursts nor aperiodic variations in the x - ray flux were detected over the course of the observation .",
    "given the paucity of counts we can not study the spectral line in more detail , and we refer to mclaughlin et al ( 2007 ) and rea et al .",
    "( 2009 in preparation ) for detailed studies based on _ xmm  newton _ data .",
    "note that the detection of the @xmath01kev absorption line with _ chandra _ shows that the _ xmm  newton _ detection was not due to any instrumental effects and confirms the reality of this feature .",
    "the very high - angular resolution of _ chandra _  allowed us to perform for the first time an image analysis on angular scales of a few arcseconds ( in the previous _ chandra _ observation the source was off - axis , affording a limited angular resolution ; reynolds et al . 2006 ) . in fig .  1 ( left ) we show the image of the field in the 0.310kev energy bands .",
    "extended emission with a complex shape is apparent .",
    "there is a more compact emission region extending to radii of roughly 5.5 , from the pulsar , and then broader diffuse emission extending out to 13 . in fig .  1 ( right ) we show the vlt - naco k@xmath29 field of ( rea et al .",
    "2009 ) , which shows that this extended emission can not be due to the x - ray emission of a cluster of massive stars in the line of sight . to infer the significance and",
    "estimate the luminosity of the whole extended emission we built a _",
    "point spread function ( psf ) using the spectrum , and subtracted it from the total 0.310kev cleaned image . from the resulting image we extracted all the photons within a 13 radius ( this roughly corresponds to an extraction from an annular region of 2.513radii : see fig",
    ".  1 left and fig.2 right ) , and we subtracted from it the background extracted from a similar region far from the source ( but in the same s3 ccd ) .",
    "we ended up with an excess of 120@xmath1717 counts , which corresponds to a detection significance of @xmath30 .",
    "the mean count rate for the whole extended emission within 13 around the source is then @xmath31 counts / s in the 0.310kev energy band . of these counts ,",
    "41@xmath179 come from the 5.5compact region , with a mean count rate of @xmath32 counts / s .    in fig.2",
    "( right ) we compare the background - subtracted surface brightness radial distribution of our _ chandra _ observation of with that of the _ chart / marx _ psf plus a simulated background image .",
    "both surface brightnesses were obtained by extracting counts from 50 annular regions ( 2 pixels wide each ) centered on the source position , and for the one , after removal of the serendipitous point source and subtracting the background .",
    "this figure shows that extended emission becomes detectable around 5 pixels ( @xmath02.5 ) from the peak of the source psf .",
    "we also performed the same analysis on a level 2 event file which was re - built turning off the pixel randomization , and applying the background cleaning of the vf mode .",
    "this neither changed the results nor improved their significance .    due to the small number of counts ,",
    "the spectrum of the diffuse emission is very poorly determined . with 120 counts in the 0.310kev range",
    ", we attempted a spectral modelling with a power - law , which gave a good @xmath33 ( 6 dof ; see fig.2 left ; the spectrum was grouped with 15 counts per bin ) .",
    "however , due to the low number of counts the spectral parameters are poorly constrained ( @xmath342 , @xmath35 , and a 0.35kev absorbed flux of @xmath362 ) .",
    "a blackbody fit was also acceptable ( @xmath372 , @xmath38kev ) , giving a @xmath39 ( 6 dof ) . however , the blackbody fit showed systematic departures from the data at high energies , and we therefore favor the power - law spectral model .",
    "we performed the same fits keeping the @xmath40 fixed at the value , finding consistent spectral parameters .",
    "to date pulsars with observed x - ray nebulae have rotational power @xmath5 ranging from @xmath41(see fig.3 ) , and they are usually rather young ( @xmath42kyr ) . in this respect , interpreting the nebula we see around as a spin - down powered pwn is difficult given its low rotational power ( @xmath43 ) and its age ( @xmath44kyr ) . from the flux of the @xmath013 extended emission ( see  [ imaging ] ) , and assuming a 3.6kpc distance , correcting for absorption and extrapolating the flux in the 0.58kev energy range , we then infer an x - ray efficiency @xmath45 for transferring spin - down power to the x - ray pwn .",
    "this x - ray efficiency is relatively high compared to the typical @xmath46 observed in other pulsars showing pwne ( see fig.3 ; and also cheng , taam & wang 2004 ; gaensler & slane 2006 ; kargaltsev & pavlov 2008 ) .",
    "one possibility to explain the high x - ray efficiency of this putative pwn might be that the distance is much closer than that inferred from the radio dm of . if the real distance is e.g. half of the current value ( i.e. 1.8kpc ) , the x - ray efficiency would be @xmath47 , similar to many other pulsars .",
    "however , even assuming a smaller distance , the luminosity of this pwn exceeds the upper bound trend for normal pulsars , @xmath48 ( kargaltsev & pavlov 2008 ) , which would instead predict a luminosity of @xmath49 , very difficult to reconcile with our result , even allowing for a wrong distance for .    a second possibility might be that the compact 5.5 structure we observe is a bow - shock nebula due to the pulsar moving supersonically through the ambient medium . these types of nebulae",
    "are indeed more commonly observed in older pulsars . in this scenario ,",
    "the larger scale extended emission could be part of the remnant of the supernova explosion which formed . if we interpret the 5.5 structure as the termination radius of a bow - shock , we get @xmath50 cm ( similar to other pulsars ; kargaltsev & pavlov 2008 ) , from which we infer a projected velocity for of @xmath51km / s , rather small for a pulsar showing a bow - shock considering a reasonable ambient medium density ( we assumed here _ n_=1@xmath52 and a 3.6kpc distance ) . on the other hand , if the characteristic age of 117  kyr is correct , we probably would not expect to see a supernova remnant , while assuming a younger age we would not expect a predominantly thermal x - ray emission , with no magnetospheric component as seen for younger pulsars",
    ".    a third possibility might be that the nebula around gets additional power from the large magnetic energy of this object through mechanisms such as ambipolar diffusion which , instead of going into powering the x - ray emission of this object ( as in the magnetar case ; thompson & duncan 1995 ) , releases its energy in the pulsar wind , or through repeated and powerful transient outbursts ( ibrahim et al .",
    "2004 ; halpern et al . 2008 ; muno et al .",
    "so far , no magnetically - powered nebula has been detected around magnetars .",
    "many observational biases might have prevented their detection , such as magnetars large distances , and their very bright emission which usually can not be observed with high - spatial resolution , but only using 1-dimensional modes ( aka timing modes ) .",
    "however , in a very few cases there has been hints for extended emission around magnetars ( see e.g. patel et al . 2003 ) .",
    "beside there are seven rotation - powered pulsars with magnetic fields greater than the quantum critical field , and two of them , psrj18460258 and psrj11196127 , have pwne associated ( helfand , collins & gotthelf 2003 ; gonzalez & safi - harb  2003 ) .",
    "they have also very high spin - down power ( @xmath53 ) , making difficult any speculation on the possible magnetic contribution to their nebulae . however , note that psrj18460258 did show episodes of magnetar - like activity ( kumar & safi - harb 2008 ; gavriil et al .",
    "2008 ) , and strong variability has been observed in its pwn ( ng et al .",
    "2009 ) in coincidence with its outburst , which supports the hypothesis of magnetic energy as an additional energy source to power its pwn . for the remaining five highly magnetic pulsars ,",
    "it is possible that magnetic - powered nebulae are commonplace , and that selection effects ( e.g. the large distances ) have precluded us detecting them .    in summary ,",
    "given the low number of counts we can not give a conclusive answer on the nature of this extended x - ray emission observed around .",
    "it is clear , however , that with our current picture of pwne around pulsars , and with the information we now have on , all traditional interpretations fail at explaining this extended emission . currently the most viable interpretation seems to be the presence of magnetic contribution to powering of this unusual nebula .",
    "further monitoring observations of are crucial to constrain any variability of this extended emission , which could be due to episodic magnetar - like outbursts , as in the case of psrj18460258 .",
