    "observing high-@xmath6 faint galaxies challenges the capability of current telescopes . among high-@xmath6 objects ,",
    "usually the brightest galaxies that formed in rare , massive halos are more easily detected .",
    "nowadays , observations of the high-@xmath6 galaxy populations have reached @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "however , it is believed that the majority of high-@xmath6 galaxies are dwarf systems which are too faint to be detected by current telescopes @xcite . accessing such a faint population of early galaxies",
    "is a compelling task as known high-@xmath6 galaxies can not provide enough ionizing photons to complete the reionization process and match the measured thomson optical depth .",
    "it is commonly believed that faint galaxies are required in order to provide the missing ionizing power @xcite .",
    "an exciting possibility to discover and study these faint galaxies is represented by gravitational lensing by relatively nearby clusters , that could magnify the brightness of objects behind the lens @xcite . a major effort along these lines is currently undertaken by the hst frontier field ( ff ) project .",
    "this project aims to perform a photometric survey of areas behind six clusters and six flanking blank fields , achieving a detection threshold deeper than any previous such kind surveys : @xmath8 magnitude ( 5@xmath9 detection for point sources ) in the @xmath10 band , implying that objects fainter than @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the magnification , will be detected .",

    "@xmath10 \" denotes the observed apparent magnitude , including the lensing effect . ] the primal observations for the cluster abell 2744 have already been analyzed @xcite .    in this _ letter _ , we aim to characterize the properties of the faint galaxy populations detectable by the ffs project , based on the numerical simulations of @xcite .",
    "we also investigate the possibility to use the number counts of the lensed faint galaxies to constrain the suppression of the galaxy formation in small dark matter halos by feedback processes .",
    "the number of galaxies with intrinsic apparent magnitude larger than @xmath13 between redshift @xmath14 and @xmath15 observed after lensing is @xcite @xmath16 where the integration covers the whole field of view ( fov ) @xmath17 ; @xmath18 is the luminosity corresponds to apparent magnitude @xmath13 , and @xmath19 is the luminosity function ( lf ) of galaxies .",
    "@xmath20 , while @xmath21 is the detection limit of the experiment .",
    "the measured number density is the combination of the surface number density dilution ( @xmath12 in the denominator ) and the brightness boost ( @xmath12 in @xmath22 ) .",
    "we use the lfs obtained from the @xcite sph simulations .",
    "the simulated volume has a linear ( comoving ) size @xmath23 mpc with @xmath24 ( dark+baryonic ) particles , corresponding to a dark matter ( baryonic ) particle mass of @xmath25 ; the corresponding force resolution is 2 kpc .",
    "we refer the reader to the original paper for additional simulation details .",
    "the simulated lfs match very well the observed ones between @xmath26 . in the following",
    ", we will always assume that the lf is observed at a rest - frame wavelength @xmath27 , while the apparent magnitude is measured in the h - band ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "therefore @xmath28 . from the simulation outputs we build a @xmath29 grid and",
    "interpolate where necessary . to correct for numerical resolution effects plaguing very faint ( @xmath30 ) galaxies hosted by halos with @xmath31 dark matter particles",
    ", we use a normalized power - law lf with slope -2 @xcite at this faint part .",
    "moreover , to account for radiative feedback effects suppressing star formation in @xmath32  k @xcite , we cut the power - law lf at a magnitude @xmath33 to @xmath34 between @xmath35 at which the number of galaxies brighter than @xmath36 equals the number of halos with @xmath37  k , taken from @xcite .    to compute the magnification",
    ", we use the lens models released on the website of the ffs project . for each lensing cluster",
    ", six lens models are provided ; the fiducial results are based on the bradac model .",
    "however , we have checked that other models do not qualitatively change our conclusions . as an example",
    ", we show the magnification map for abell 2744 with sources located at @xmath38 in fig .",
    "[ magnifmap ] .",
    "the fov of hst / wfc3 is marked by magenta lines .",
    "we plot the number of observed galaxies _ fainter _",
    "than h - band intrinsic magnitude @xmath13 and have @xmath39 in the upper panel fig . [",
    "n_observed ] .",
    "the curves give the results based on the bradac model , the difference between lens models is shown by filled regions .",
    "our discussions are based on bradac model hereafter . in the ffs project , it is possible to detect galaxies as faint as @xmath0 ( @xmath40 , i.e. at least one galaxy ) behind the abell 2744 ( thin lines ) , or one magnitude deeper if all the six lens clusters are considered ( thick lines ) .",
    "about 15 such galaxies with @xmath41 between @xmath38 and @xmath42 are expected behind abell 2744 , while if the survey of all the six lenses is completed , such number increases to @xmath43 .",
    "of course this is the most optimistic case as galaxies are not point sources ; considering the incompleteness correction , the actual detection depth for galaxies could be more than one magnitude shallower @xcite . in the bottom panel of fig . [",
    "n_observed ] , we plot the number of observed galaxies in @xmath39 , and _ brighter _ than h - band _ observed _ magnitude in the lens fields ( solid ) and in the blank fields ( dashed )",
    ".    the abell 2744 wfc3 field area ( @xmath44 ) contains @xmath45 halos above @xmath46 in @xmath47 . among them , about 200 could be observed as galaxies with @xmath48 ; therefore the completeness is @xmath49 . using the cosmic variance calculator @xcite we get a relative variance @xmath50 .",
    "about 15 could be observed as galaxies with @xmath51 , yielding a completeness of @xmath52 and a relative variance of @xmath53 .    in practice , however , foreground light contamination from the lensing cluster itself may reduce the detectability .",
    "we estimate this effect as follows .",
    "we downloaded the latest h - band image of abell 2744 from the ffs website .",
    "this image is used as the foreground map ( we neglect the fact that some light in this map is from the high-@xmath6 galaxies we are searching for , as these only fill a very small area ) .",
    "the fwhm of the psf is about 0.2@xmath54 ; as a result , for a point source and a gaussian psf , the central pixel contains about 30% of the total flux ( the size of each pixel is 0.06@xmath54 ) . centered on this pixel , we choose a region within a certain radius , @xmath55 , and compute the mean , @xmath56 , and rms , @xmath9 , flux of all pixels in this region .",
    "this point source is defined as detectable in this search radius when its central flux peak is : a ) @xmath57 , and b ) @xmath58 within this radius .",
    "we use different values of @xmath55 in the range 0.1@xmath54 to 0.6@xmath54 ; a point source is defined as detectable only if it is detectable for all values of @xmath55 in this range .",
    "assuming a point source with @xmath8 , we mask the map areas in which such source is not detectable ( purple regions in fig . [ mask ] ) .",
    "we find that 80% of the regions with @xmath59 are not masked . for brighter sources",
    ", this fraction would be even larger .",
    "therefore we conclude that the contamination does not constitute a serious problem for the search of ultra - faint galaxies .",
    "what are the physical properties of the high-@xmath6 faint ( @xmath60 ) galaxies that will be possibly detected in the ffs ?",
    "we are particularly interested in galaxies fainter than @xmath61 and therefore are non - detectable in current deepest surveys @xcite without lensing .",
    "the ultra - faint galaxies are grouped in three magnitude bins : @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "their simulated properties are discussed in the following .    the mass distribution of the host halos of these galaxies in various magnitude bins is plotted in fig .",
    "[ halomass ] .",
    "the typical halo mass depends on brightness , with the brighter galaxies located in larger halos .",
    "however , even for galaxies in the @xmath65 magnitude bin , the host halo distribution peaks around masses as small as @xmath66 . at @xmath38 ,",
    "about 10% of the galaxies in the @xmath67 magnitude bin resides in even smaller halos , @xmath68 ; the corresponding virial temperature of such halos is @xmath69 k ( assuming ionized gas ) , i.e. very close to the lower boundary ( @xmath70 k ) of atomic - cooling halos . @xmath71",
    "k halos should be strongly affected by photoionization feedback which evaporates their gas and strongly suppresses their star formation .",
    "hence , determining the abundance of such halos allows a precise assessment of the importance of feedback in the early universe . we will come back to these implications later on .",
    "quite interestingly , even these small galaxies are already relatively metal enriched , as can be seen by inspecting fig .",
    "[ metallicity ] . at a given redshift , the difference in metallicity trend with magnitude is not as obvious as for the host halo mass . at @xmath38 ,",
    "the mean ultra - faint galaxy metallicity is @xmath72 , while at @xmath73 it is @xmath74 .",
    "we also find that even in such faint galaxies , there is little hope to detect the pop iii star component , as its contribution to the h - band luminosity is limited to only @xmath751% of the host galaxies .",
    "we have also computed the uv spectral slope , @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) , of ultra - faint galaxies .",
    "we fit this slope from the uv spectrum between rest - frame wavelength @xmath78 . at @xmath79 ultra - faint galaxies ( @xmath80 )",
    "have @xmath81 , while at @xmath73 , @xmath82 .",
    "the errors are the rms of the data , however , considering the dispersion of the escape fraction that is not modeled in simulations and the uncertainty on the star formation mode ( constant star formation rate or instantaneous burst ) , the actual slope may span a larger range .    as a caveat , results of fig .",
    "[ halomass ] and fig .",
    "[ metallicity ] for the faintest among the observable galaxies may be somewhat uncertain due to numerical resolution effects that are difficult to quantify at this stage .",
    "for example , @xcite pointed out that metallicity could be underestimated by 0.1 dex due to poor resolution .",
    "we plot the star formation rate density ( sfrd ) of the ultra - faint galaxies in different magnitude bins as a function of redshift in fig .",
    "the sfrd of galaxies with @xmath83 is calculated using the power - law extrapolation discussed in sec .",
    "[ number ] together with the sfr - @xmath84 relation obtained from simulations which does not vary above and below this magnitude . in the same panel",
    ", we also plot the sfrd that fits the observed bright ( @xmath85 ) galaxies for @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) and @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) by the thin line @xcite .",
    "the ultra - faint galaxy sfrd is about @xmath90 times that for the currently known bright galaxies at any epoch .",
    "thus , we are led to conclude that possibly the ffs project could unveil for the first time galaxies that are the major reionization sources .",
    "it might also lend further support to the idea that the majority of star - forming galaxies are ultra - faint systems and are still below the detection limit of current surveys .",
    "in sec . [ number ] we have predicted the number of ultra - faint galaxies that would be detected through gravitational lensing in the absence of radiative feedback .",
    "however , if such faint galaxies are either not detected or their number is much smaller than expected , this would provide key missing information on the suppression of star formation in small galaxies by radiative feedback , i.e. photo - evaporation and/or heating of their gas by the cosmic uv background radiation    as a preliminary test , we assume halos below a certain circular velocity , @xmath91 , do not form stars .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ feedback ] .",
    "if halos with @xmath92  km s@xmath4 are starless , we should not observe galaxies fainter than @xmath93 in the ffs project .",
    "the lf slope , @xmath94 , contains observational uncertainty .",
    "@xcite simulations predict @xmath95 even for galaxies at @xmath79 ; however , the slope derived from observations of bright galaxies is shallower , @xmath96 at @xmath79 @xcite . to check if our conclusions hold when adopting the schechter lf that fits observations , we plot the number of faint galaxies by using the schechter lf @xcite . even in this case",
    "we confirm that it is still possible to detect galaxies as faint as @xmath97 .",
    "the shortage of small galaxies could also arise from modification of the power spectrum in wdm cosmologies @xcite .",
    "it will be possible to break this degeneracy by future observations that directly constrain the dm halo abundance .",
    "in this _ letter _ we have predicted the properties of ultra - faint galaxies that should be detectable through the gravitational lensing in the ffs project . using bradac",
    "s ffs lens models , we estimated that in the most optimistic case galaxies as faint as @xmath0 should be detected .",
    "most ultra - faint galaxies ( intrinsic @xmath98 ) are located in host halos with mass @xmath99 , where the galaxy formation is believed to be sensitive to the feedback .",
    "therefore the ffs project may provide an unique chance to directly assess the impact of radiative feedback in the early universe for the first time .",
    "we have also found that in @xmath47 , the sfrd in galaxies between @xmath98 is about @xmath90 times the sfr of all high-@xmath6 bright galaxies observed so far .",
    "this implies that with ffs we are on the verge to unveil the major sources of cosmic reionization .",
    "compared to bright galaxies , the abundance of ultra - faint galaxies is very sensitive to the effects of radiative feedback which suppresses the formation of stars in small halos : for example , if galaxy formation is suppressed in halos with circular velocity @xmath3  km s@xmath4 , we should not observe galaxies fainter than @xmath5 , providing a stringent test to feedback models .",
    "this work utilizes gravitational lensing models produced by pis bradac , ebeling , merten & zitrin , sharon , and williams funded as part of the hst frontier fields program conducted by stsci .",
