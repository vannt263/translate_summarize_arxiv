    "rotating white dwarfs ( rwds ) , depending on their mass , i.e. , whether they are sub - chandrasekhar white dwarfs ( wds ) or super - chandrasekhar wds , display different behavior .",
    "namely , both uniformly and differentially rotating super - chandrasekhar white dwarfs ( scwds ) spin - up by angular momentum loss whereas sub - chandrasekhar wds only spin - down by angular momentum loss .",
    "we should mention that the spin - up of rapidly - rotating stars was first described by shapiro et al .",
    "@xcite and later by geroyannis and papasotiriou @xcite . in both refs . @xcite and @xcite the authors performed computations in classical physics without taking into account the effects of general relativity ( gr ) although gr is very crucial in investigating the stability of rwds @xcite .",
    "several scenarios for obtaining scwds exist : a single degenerate scenario @xcite , where a wd grows in mass through accretion from a non - degenerate stellar companion ; a double degenerate scenario @xcite , where two wds merge after losing energy and angular momentum through the radiation of gravitational waves ; and a core degenerate scenario @xcite , where the merger occurs in a common envelop with a massive asymptotic branch star . according to ilkov and soker @xcite , scwds",
    "explode as type ia supernovae on a spin - down time scale @xmath0 due to magnetic - dipole braking .",
    "the characteristic time scale of a scwd before supernova explosion has been estimated by ilkov and soker @xcite to be @xmath1 yr for magnetic fields in the range @xmath2 g.    moreover , following and extending the ideas of morini et al .",
    "@xcite and paczynski @xcite , malheiro et al .",
    "@xcite proposed the model of massive highly - magnetized fast rwds . according to malheiro et al .",
    ", unlike the widely accepted the magnetar model @xcite , the basic physical properties of soft gamma repeaters and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( sgrs and axps ) can be well explained within the wd model .",
    "the advantages and the drawbacks of both models are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in our recent work @xcite , we computed general relativistic configurations of uniformly rwds within hartle s formalism @xcite .",
    "we used the relativistic feynman - metropolis - teller equation of state @xcite for wd matter , which generalizes the traditionally - used equation of state of salpeter @xcite .",
    "the stability of rotating wds was analyzed taking into account the mass - shedding limit , inverse @xmath3-decay instability , and secular axisymmetric instability , with the last being determined by using the turning point method of friedman et al .",
    "it has been shown there that rwds can be stable up to rotation periods of @xmath4 s ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] for details ) .",
    "this range of stable rotation periods for wds amply covers the observed rotation rates of sgrs and axps , @xmath5@xmath6 s. the minimum rotation period @xmath7 of wds is obtained for a configuration rotating along the keplerian sequence at the critical inverse @xmath3-decay density ; namely , this is the configuration lying at the crossing point between the mass - shedding and the inverse @xmath3-decay boundaries .",
    "the numerical values of the minimum rotation period @xmath8 and @xmath9 s and the maximum masses @xmath10 and @xmath11 solar mass were found for helium ( he ) , carbon ( c ) , oxygen ( o ) , and iron ( fe ) wds , respectively @xcite .",
    "recently , rueda et al .",
    "@xcite studied the possibility that the peculiar axp 4u 0141 + 61 is a massive , rapidly - rotating , highly - magnetized white dwarf and explored the viability of this object being the result of the coalescence of a binary white dwarf .",
    "specifically , from its observed rotational velocity , the bounds for the mass , radius , moment of inertia , etc . were derived ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .    in this work , we consider the astrophysical implications of rotating wds based on the results of boshkayev et al .",
    "particularly , in order to investigate the spin - up and the spin - down of both sub- and super - chandrasekhar wds , unlike shapiro et al .",
    "@xcite and geroyannis and papasotiriou @xcite , we perform our computations in gr .",
    "we also perform computations analogous to those of ilkov and socker @xcite to estimate the spin - down time scale @xmath0 due to magnetic dipole braking in gr by relaxing the constancy of the radius and the moment of inertia of a rwd .",
    "eventually , fulfilling all the stability criteria for rwds in gr on the basis of the wd model of malheiro et al .",
    "@xcite , we consider one of the so - called low - magnetic - field magnetars sgr 0418 + 5729 and give bounds for the mass , radius , moment of inertia , and magnetic field .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec:2 ] , we discuss spin - up and spin - down of rotating scwds , in section [ sec:3 ] , we consider delayed supernova explosions of scwds , and in section [ sec:4 ] , we calculate the main physical parameters of sgr 0418 + 5729 within the massive rapidly - rotating highly - magnetized white dwarf model .",
    "finally , in section [ sec:5 ] , we summarize our main results , discuss their significance , and draw our conclusions .",
    "at constant rest - mass @xmath12 , entropy @xmath13 and chemical composition @xmath14 , the spin evolution of a rwd is given by ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the angular velocity , @xmath19 is the energy , and @xmath20 is the angular momentum of the star .",
    "the solid black curves correspond to @xmath20=constant sequences , where the static case @xmath21 is the thickest one .",
    "the colored thin - dashed curves correspond to @xmath18=constant sequences .",
    "the keplerian sequence is the red thick - dashed curve , the blue thick - dotted - dashed curve is the inverse @xmath3-decay instability boundary , and the green - thick dotted curve is the axisymmetric secular instability boundary . ]    thus , if a rwd is losing energy by some mechanism during its evolution , that is , @xmath22 , the change in the angular velocity @xmath18 with time depends on the sign of @xmath23 ; rwds that evolve along a track with @xmath24 will spin - down ( @xmath25 ) , and the ones following tracks with @xmath26 will spin - up ( @xmath27 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : consomj ] , we show @xmath28constant and @xmath29constant sequences in the mass - central density diagram , and in fig .  [",
    "fig : consomj2 ] , we show contours of constant rest - mass in the @xmath30 plane .     plane ; rwds that evolve along a track with @xmath24 spin - down by loosing angular momentum while the ones with @xmath26 spin - up . ]",
    "the sign of @xmath31 can be analyzed from fig .",
    "[ fig : consomj ] by joining two consecutive @xmath29 constant sequences with an horizontal line and taking into account that @xmath20 decreases from left to right and from top to bottom .",
    "the angular velocity @xmath18 , instead , decreases from right to left and from top to bottom for scwds , and for sub - chandrasekhar wds , it decreases from left to right and from top to bottom .",
    "we note that , in the scwd region , @xmath28 constant sequences satisfy @xmath32 while in the sub - chandrasekhar region , both @xmath32 and @xmath33 appear ( see minima ) .",
    "scwds can only either spin - up by angular momentum loss or spin - down by gaining angular momentum . in the latter case ,",
    "the rwd becomes decompressed with time , increasing its radius and moment of inertia : thus , scwds following this evolution track will end at the mass - shedding limit ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : consomj ] ) .    some evolutionary tracks of sub - chandrasekhar wds and scwds",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : consomj2 ] .",
    "it is appropriate to recall here that shapiro et al .",
    "@xcite showed that spin - up behavior by angular momentum loss occurs for rapidly - rotating newtonian polytropes if the polytropic index is very close to @xmath34 , namely , for an adiabatic index @xmath35 .",
    "geroyannis and papasotiriou @xcite explicitly showed that those conditions were achieved only by super - chandrasekhar polytropes . besides the corroboration of the above known result for scwds in the general relativistic case ,",
    "we report here the presence of minima @xmath36 for some sub - chandrasekhar masses ( see , e.g. , the evolution track of the rwd with @xmath37 in fig .",
    "[ fig : consomj2 ] ) , which raises the possibility that sub - chandrasekhar wds can experience , by angular momentum loss , not only the intuitive spin - down evolution but also spin - up epochs .",
    "the majority of observed magnetic wds are massive , for instance , rej 0317 - 853 with @xmath38 and @xmath39@xmath40 g ( see , e.g. , refs . @xcite and ) , pg 1658 + 441 with @xmath41 and @xmath42 g ( see , e.g. , refs . @xcite and @xcite ) , and",
    "pg 1031 + 234 with the highest magnetic field @xmath43 g ( see , e.g. , refs . @xcite and ) .",
    "however , they are generally found to be slow - rotators ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . recently garcia - berro et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that such magnetic wds can be , indeed , the result of the merger of double degenerate binaries ; the misalignment of the final magnetic dipole moment of the newly - born rwd with the rotation axis of the star depends on the difference between the masses of the wd components of the binary .",
    "the magnetic braking of scwds has been recently invoked as a possible mechanism to explain the delayed time distribution of type ia supernovae ( sne ) ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) : a type ia sn explosion is delayed for a time typical of the spin - down time scale @xmath0 due to magnetic braking , providing the result of the merging process of a wd binary system is a magnetic scwd rather than a sub - chandrasekhar one .",
    "the characteristic time scale @xmath0 of the scwd has been estimated to be @xmath1 yr for magnetic fields in the range @xmath2 g.    a constant moment of inertia @xmath44 g @xmath45 and a fixed critical ( maximum ) rotation angular velocity , @xmath46 have been adopted in ref .",
    "it is important to recall here that scwds spin - up by angular momentum loss ; therefore , the reference to a `` spin - down '' time scale for them is just historical .",
    "scwds then evolve toward the mass - shedding limit , which determines , in this case , the critical angular velocity for rotational instability ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : consomj2 ] ) .",
    "if we express @xmath47 in terms of @xmath48 , taking into account the values of the dimensionless angular momentum @xmath49 and the dimensionless quadrupole moment @xmath50 from the numerical integration , we find for rwds , that @xmath51 , where the coefficient @xmath52 varies in the interval [ 0.78 , 0.75 ] in the range of central densities @xmath53 $ ] g @xmath54 ( see boshkayev et al .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "it is important to mention that the above range of @xmath52 remains approximately the same independently of the chemical composition of the wd .     in myr versus wd mass in units of @xmath55 for @xmath56c rwds .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath57 is in gauss . ]    furthermore , as we have shown , the evolution track followed by a scwd depends strongly on the initial conditions of mass and angular momentum , as well as on the chemical composition and the evolution of the moment of inertia .",
    "clearly , the assumption of fixed moment of inertia , @xmath58 g @xmath45 , leads to a spin - down time scale that depends only on the magnetic field s strength .",
    "a detailed computation will lead to a strong dependence on the mass of the scwd , resulting in a two - parameter family of delayed times @xmath59 .    to the above",
    ", we have performed similar analyses in order to estimate the characteristic time scale for the realistic equation of state of wds presented in ref .",
    "@xcite by relaxing the constancy of the moment of inertia , radius and other parameters of rwds .",
    "indeed we have shown here that all parameters are functions of the central density and the angular velocity ( rotation period ) : @xmath60 where @xmath20 , @xmath18 and @xmath61 are calculated along the specific constant - rest - mass sequences shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : consomj2 ] .",
    "hence , we have performed more refined analyses by taking into consideration all the stability criteria , except for the pycnonuclear instabilities , for the sake of generality .",
    "the characteristic time @xmath62 or @xmath63 versus wd mass in units of @xmath55 for @xmath56c rwds is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lifetime ] , where we can see that the higher the magnetic field , the shorter the lifetime of the rotating super - chandrasekhar wd .",
    "correspondingly , a more massive wd will have a shorter life span and vice versa .",
    "interestingly , the time scales shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lifetime ] are consistent with those of ilkov and socker @xcite and klebi et al .",
    "sgrs and axps are a class of compact objects that show interesting observational properties not observed in ordinary pulsars ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) : rotational periods in the range @xmath64@xmath65 s , a narrow range with respect to the wide range of ordinary pulsars @xmath66@xmath67 s ; spin - down rates @xmath68@xmath69 , larger than ordinary those of pulsars @xmath70 ; strong outbursts of energies , @xmath71@xmath72 erg ; and for the case of sgrs , giant flares of even larger energies of @xmath73@xmath74 erg . here",
    ", we describe one of the so - called _ low - magnetic - field magnetars _ , sgr 0418 + 5729 , as a massive rapidly - rotating highly - magnetized wd and infer from theory basic physical parameter of that source . in doing so , we extend the work of malheiro et al . @xcite by using the precise wd parameters recently obtained by boshkayev et al .",
    "@xcite for general relativistic uniformly - rotating wds .",
    "the loss of rotational energy associated with the spin - down of the wd is given by @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the moment of inertia of the wd in units of @xmath77 g @xmath45 .",

    "the numbers show the period @xmath78 in seconds . ]",
    "the upper limit on the magnetic field ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) obtained by requiring that the rotational energy loss due to the dipole field be smaller than the electromagnetic emission of the magnetic dipole is given by @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the mean radius of the wd in units of @xmath81 cm .",
    "the mean radius is given by @xmath82 ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) with @xmath83 and @xmath84 being the equatorial and the polar radius of the star , respectively . clearly , the specific values of the rotational energy loss and the magnetic field depend on the observed parameters , such as @xmath78 and @xmath85 , and on the model parameters , such as the mass , moment of inertia , and mean radius of the rotating wd .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : consomj3 ] , every @xmath18=constant or equivalently @xmath78=constant sequence can be seen to intersect the stability region of general relativistic uniformly - rwds ( @xmath86-@xmath83 curves inside the shaded region ) at two points .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : sgr0418 ]    thus , to calculate all the bounds , we need to know only the rotational period @xmath78 and the spin - down rate @xmath85 from observations of the source considered .",

    "although we derived the bounds of parameters for the specific source sgr 0418 + 5729 , the results of table [ tab : sgr0418 ] are consistent with the observed values of the mass and the magnetic field for other massive magnetic wds .",
    "in this work , we showed that all stable uniformly - rwds can exist only in the stability region .",
    "hence , we assume that we have various wds at different times in their evolution without involving the details and the routes of their entire evolution .",
