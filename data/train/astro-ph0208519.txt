    "high - mass ( ob ; @xmath4 ) stars are believed to form in clusters within molecular cloud complexes . due to their high ultraviolet luminosity , massive young stellar objects ( ysos ) first heat , then ionize , and disrupt their surrounding molecular cloud .",
    "owing to their large distances to the sun and the complex interplay between massive ysos and the neighboring interstellar medium , the formation of high - mass stars is still poorly understood .",
    "many studies have been devoted to embedded ysos that have already developed an h region and thus are easily detectable in far - infrared and centimeter continuum surveys ( see a review by @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , possible precursors of ultracompact h regions ( uchs ) , i.e. massive ysos in their main building phase , have only been discovered recently ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these massive protostars , also called high - mass protostellar objects ( hmpos ) , are inconspicuous in the iras bands and have no , or very little free - free emission .",
    "they can be detected in ( sub)millimeter dust continuum and molecular high - density tracers and frequently display h@xmath5o / ch@xmath6oh maser emission .",
    "therefore , submillimeter continuum imaging of molecular cloud complexes is ideal to probe clouds surrounding uchs and hmpos simultaneously .",
    "making a census of those deeply embedded phases is the first necessary step to gain insight into the processes leading to the formation of a massive star .",
    "the w43 star - forming complex is located in the inner spiral arm of our galaxy , at 5.5  kpc from the sun @xcite .",
    "w43 is well - known for its giant h region emitting @xmath7 lyman continuum photons per second and a far - infrared continuum luminosity of @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the main ionizing source of w43 was discovered in near - infrared images by @xcite and confirmed by @xcite as a cluster of wolf - rayet ( wr ) and ob main sequence stars .",
    "the inner 20  pc of w43 ( at @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) contain this wr / ob cluster and a @xmath11 molecular cloud called g30.8 - 0.0 .",
    "the w43 main complex was mapped in co lines and parts of it in higher density tracers such as h@xmath5co and hco@xmath12 lines , and 1.3  mm continuum @xcite .",
    "several sources were identified by these authors but a complete and comprehensive sample of uch regions and massive protostars is still lacking . identifying such",
    "a sample is essential for the present paper , which aims at presenting a global scenario of ( massive ) star formation in w43 .",
    "therefore , we will carefully investigate the distribution of dense molecular clouds in the w43 main complex , in particular to identify sites of future or on - going massive star formation .    a detailed study of w43 may help constrain the properties of distant starburst galaxies .",
    "indeed , the large luminosity and ionizing flux of the w43 giant h region are similar to those of ngc  3603 or m17 ( @xmath13 and @xmath14  lyc@xmath15s@xmath16 ) , taken to be representative of clusters and h regions in starburst galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the ngc  3603 stellar cluster is qualified as `` starburst '' because it consists of several tens of wr , o , and b - type stars ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the w43 cluster of main sequence stars is likely to be similar but more heavily reddened ( @xmath17  mag versus 4  mag in ngc  3603 ) .",
    "since the w43 stellar cluster is closely associated with giant molecular clouds , we may be witnessing another burst of star formation .",
    "this would make the w43 main complex a galactic mini - starburst region , i.e. a miniature model of the stellar and gas content of starburst regions in distant galaxies .    in the present paper ,",
    "we report a submillimeter continuum and spectroscopic study of the w43 main complex . from the imaging and deep spectroscopic measurements presented in sect .  2",
    ", we make a complete census of the compact and dense cloud fragments in w43 ( sect .  3 ) . in sect .  4",

    "[ f : dust]a can fairly well be described by a sum of @xmath60 cloud fragments with 2-d gaussian shapes .",
    "since most of such fragments consist of moderate - density gas ( @xmath61 , see below ) , they are unlikely sites for massive star formation .    we thus need to separate compact and dense cloud fragments from their surrounding , lower density clouds .",

    "the next step of the analysis is to ensure that the submillimeter fragments selected above are indeed dense cloud fragments .",
    "we thus need to check the contamination of submillimeter fluxes by lines and free - free emission .",
    "contamination by co line emission is negligible for those fragments which are dense and compact .",
    "in contrast , the `` hot core '' line emission displayed by several fragments ( motte et al . in prep . ) contributes to the submillimeter continuum fluxes we measure .",

    "we consider that @xmath80 is an upper limit for the line contamination of the w43 submillimeter fragments .    without a doubt , the main source of contamination of 1.3  mm fluxes is the free - free emission from h regions . to estimate such a contamination ,",

    "in contrast , at the location of the giant h region @xcite , the map has a lower index : @xmath83 . since there is a good correspondance between these low @xmath72 values and the large - scale ionized gas ( cf .",
    "[ f : index ] ) , the 1.3  mm fluxes measured in that region are likely contaminated by free - free emission .",
    "most of the free - free emission in w43 arises from its giant h region and is probably optically thin at centimeter wavelengths .",
    "any ultra - compact h regions in w43 should have a free - free emission at least partly optically thick .",
    "the spectral indices computed for the two most compact centimeter sources are however indicating that their free - free emission is mostly optically thin when @xmath84  cm ( see sect .",

    "@xcite also predicted the existence of @xmath183  pc condensations embedded within massive and turbulent cloud fragments .",
    "because the compact fragments of w43 are indeed massive ( @xmath191 ) and turbulent ( @xmath192 ) , they are likely to consist of many smaller - size and denser structures orbiting within the same cloud .",
    "this interpretation argues for the protocluster nature of the submillimeter fragments we have identified .    with present observations only , we can not draw definite conclusions on the gravitational status of w43 protoclusters ( see sect .",

    "the small @xmath137 ratios observed for some of the most massive protocluster candidates suggest the majority of them could be far from virial equilibrium .",
    "besides , the mean ellipticity of the w43 protoclusters ( axis ratio 1:2 ) resembles that observed for low - mass dense cores and is definitively larger than that of gravitationally bound starless condensations @xcite .",
    "it thus agrees with the idea that w43 protoclusters are generally not in a gravitation - dominant regime but probably consist of material governed by turbulence . however , protocluster candidates are embedded within some hotter lower - density gas , so that the external pressure could substantially help confine the protocluster gas and maybe prevent it from dispersing .",
    "note that the structures we define here as protocluster candidates do not need to evolve independently from their surrounding gas , in which one expects low- to intermediate - mass stars to form .    strikingly , these protocluster candidates are very dense ( mean density of @xmath193 , see table  [ t : mass ] ) compared to their low - mass counterparts ( @xmath194 , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in fact they are as dense as the low - mass starless condensations , which are believed to be the direct progenitors of single ( or binary ) stars @xcite .",
    "such a dense cloud medium is thus regularly observed in low - mass star - forming clusters , but not over @xmath189  pc scale , which is ten times larger than the typical size of starless condensations .",
    "furthermore , we stress that the density of smaller - scale fragments within those protoclusters will surely be much higher . similar densities , sizes , masses and line widths have already been recorded for protoclusters harboring uchs and hmpos @xcite .",
    "such cloud characteristics may then enhance star formation and allow the formation of massive stars .",
    "the unbiased survey we made in the w43 main complex should be sensitive to protoclusters either being pre - stellar or containing massive protostars or uch regions .",
    "as all sources are at the same distance from the sun and in the same cloud complex , the resulting sample is far more homogeneous than in any other previous study ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "no doubt that follow - ups of such a complete and comprehensive sample will help understand the formation mechanism of massive stars .",

    "such low temperatures ( @xmath118 ) are unusual for sites of massive star formation where @xmath232 is measured @xcite .",
    "low temperatures coupled with high densities , could be one key element of the recipe for local mini - starbursts",
    ". another obvious element may be the impact of the revealed cluster of wr / ob stars onto the cloud .",
    "further studies are requested before one can make any breakthrough on the origin of such mini - starburst in our galaxy .",
    "w43 is a molecular and h complex whose ionized gas has been far better studied than its molecular component .",
    "we have imaged the w43 main cloud at submillimeter wavelengths in the 1.3  mm and @xmath18 continuum and hco@xmath12(3 - 2 ) line emission .",
    "in addition , we have obtained deep hco@xmath12(3 - 2 ) and h@xmath37co@xmath12(3 - 2 ) spectra at selected locations .",
    "our main findings can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "a multiresolution analysis on our submillimeter continuum maps identifies @xmath0 compact fragments .",
    "our @xmath18 continuum observations along with the 3.5  cm image of @xcite show that their 1.3  mm emission is largely thermal emission from cool dust .",
    "2 .   these bona - fide cloud fragments have diameters varying from 0.09  pc to 0.56  pc and masses spanning the range @xmath186 to @xmath187 .",
    "their large size and turbulent line width ( @xmath233 ) suggest they are protoclusters , i.e. clouds that contain many smaller - size and denser structures and will form star clusters .",
    "those protocluster candidates have large mean densities ( @xmath193 ) reminiscent of the direct progenitors of individual low - mass stars .",
    "the w43 protocluster candidates thus constitute an excellent sample for studies of the earliest stages of massive star formation .",
    "the present , unbiased survey is sensitive to protoclusters either being pre - stellar or containing massive protostars or uch regions .",
    "five of the w43 protoclusters are confirmed to contain massive ysos in their hmpo or uch phase .",
    "follow - up observations are needed to determine the evolutionary state of the remaining protocluster candidates .",
    "4 .   in w43",
    ", the centimeter and infrared emission from the giant h region dominates , preventing the detection of more compact sources that could be associated with uchs .",
    "notably , at least two of the three iras point sources of the w43 main cloud are not stellar in nature ; they are instead associated with ionization fronts possibly all excited by the closeby wr / ob cluster .",
    "while the low - density clouds surrounding the starburst cluster may have been blown away , the densest parts of the w43 molecular clouds seem to remain at the systemic velocity given by galactic motions .",
    "a more precise kinematic study is necessary to determine if the ionization front associated with the giant h region is compressing the molecular clouds and triggering star formation",
    "w43 is the site of at least two remarkably efficient episodes of massive star formation .",
    "indeed , it is known to harbor a starburst cluster containing several wr and ob stars ( @xmath234 ) .",
    "we show here that the molecular complex is currently undergoing a second mini - starburst with a star formation efficiency of @xmath235  yr and possibly a final stellar density of @xmath229 stars / pc@xmath228 over ( 14  pc)@xmath228 .",
    "learning about the global characteristics of this galactic mini - starburst region should help constraining the physical processes at work in the distant starburst galaxies .",
    "we are grateful to dana balser and harvey liszt for the permission to use their 3.5  cm and 21  cm data and to carsten kramer for providing us with the gaussclumps program and many helpful comments regarding its use .",
    "we also thank philippe andr , sylvain bontemps and the anonymous referee for useful comments .",

    "<S> we have carried out a submillimeter continuum and spectroscopic study of the w43 main complex , a massive star - forming region , which harbors a giant h region . </S>",
    "<S> the maps reveal a filamentary structure containing @xmath0 fragments with masses of @xmath1 and typical diameters of 0.25  pc . </S>",
    "<S> their large sizes , large non - thermal velocities ( @xmath2 ) , and high densities ( @xmath3 ) suggest that they are protoclusters and excellent sites to form massive stars . </S>",
    "<S> follow - up observations are necessary , but we have already identified three protoclusters to be very good candidates for containing very young massive protostars . </S>",
    "<S> the starburst cluster , that excites the giant h region has a large impact on the molecular complex . </S>",
    "<S> however , it remains unclear if this first episode of star formation is triggering the formation of new massive stars , through ionization shocks crossing the closeby molecular clouds . </S>",
    "<S> w43 is thus an ideal laboratory to investigate massive star formation from the protostellar phase to that of giant h regions . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the very active star - forming complex w43 may be considered a galactic mini - starburst region that could be used as a miniature model of starburst galaxies . </S>"
