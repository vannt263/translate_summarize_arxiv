    "the excited states of the nucleon  @xcite have been studied in a wide array of reactions initiated mainly by pion and photon beams .",

    "the motivation for this new fit is twofold . by changing the parameterization , we are able to gauge the stability of the amplitudes and resonance positions .",

    "the @xmath14-fits to data have been additionally constrained using the forward @xmath15 dispersion relations and fixed - t dispersion relations for the invariant @xmath16 amplitudes .",
    "the standard cm parametrization can be expressed in terms of the on - shell heitler partial wave @xmath1 matrix , @xmath1 as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the ( complex ) scattering energy , @xmath19 is the chew - mandelstam @xmath1 matrix and @xmath20 is a diagonal matrix , whose matrix elements are termed the chew - mandelstam functions  @xcite .",

    "the fit produces a unitary s - matrix of amplitudes for all contributing channels . while those channels not fitted to data",
    "are unlikely to give a quantitative representation of the reaction ( for example @xmath40 ) , they can be used to construct a set of eigenphases , which provide an interesting characterization of resonance behavior .",
    "the unitarity of the @xmath3 matrix implies that its eigenvalues are phase factors .",

    "our objective is the numerical evaluation of the eigenphases given the @xmath2-matrix elements from various fits .",
    "this is straightforward at a given energy , using a standard routine to diagonalize the unitary @xmath3 matrix .",
    "the only complicating issue is correlating a given eigenphase , @xmath47 with the appropriate eigenchannel when two ( or more ) eigenphases converge as the energy changes .",
    "in other words , once an eigenchannel @xmath48 is determined , we must track it for all energies .",
    "the no - crossing theorem@xcite is readily generalized to unitary matrices and shows that , in a given partial wave , the eigenphases may not be equal for any energy .",
    "this property is exhibited in the eigenphase plots discussed below .",
    "given the @xmath2 matrix at some energy , @xmath49 , we can form the @xmath50 matrix .",

    "if the eigenvalues are nearly degenerate at some energy , it is difficult to distinguish which eigenvalue corresponds to a given eigenchannel , say @xmath48 , since diagonalization of @xmath3 does nt preserve the eigenchannel ordering .",
    "the set of eigenvectors , however , must be orthogonal at any energy ; and , for continuous partial wave amplitudes , the change of the eigenvector for a given eigenchannel is small for nearby energies .",
    "the eigenchannels are maintained using the following method .",

    "[ fig : f1 ] . differences in the partial waves are slight , and the fit quality is comparable over the resonance region , each fit using a similar number of parameters .",

    "only the @xmath98 and @xmath99 channels have been constrained by data .",
    "the behavior of these phases does , however , provide an interesting perspective on the emergence of resonance structures in the fits .    in the @xmath7 partial wave ,",
    "both fits have two eigenphases crossing 90 degrees , at 1535 and 1670  mev for wi08 , and at 1530 and 1700  mev for xp08 . if one computes the usual heitler @xmath1 matrix , as was done in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath1-matrix poles are found at these energies ( since the unitary transformation , @xmath41 [ eq . ] diagonalizes @xmath1 simultaneously with @xmath3 and @xmath100 ) . in the @xmath77 partial wave , a 2- and 3-channel fit",
    "are compared , yielding identical crossing energies , again corresponding to a @xmath1-matrix pole ( at 1655  mev ) .",
    "note that in the wi08 plot , two eigenphase nearly touch , but do not cross .",
    "in the @xmath80 plot , only one of the solutions has a 90 degree crossing leading to a @xmath1-matrix pole .",
    "note , however , that the energy dependence of the eigenphase crossing , and nearly crossing 90 degrees , is very similar .",
    "this feature determines another measure of resonance behavior , to be discussed below .",
    "the @xmath85 eigenphases are quite different in the two fits . in the wi08 fit , there are no 90 degree crossings , while in xp08 , we see two crossings .",
    "this hints at a different resonance structure , though the @xmath0 @xmath2 matrices are nearly identical .    in the @xmath8 and @xmath94 eigenphase plots",
    ", the xp08 solution has a single crossing , whereas the wi08 solution does not . here also , a comparison of the eigenphases which cross , or come close to crossing , 90 degrees have a similar energy dependence .",
    "as has been noted previously@xcite , resonances may be associated with a single eigenphase crossing 90 degrees , and this will result in a @xmath1-matrix pole .",
    "however , a more robust measure ( if a set of amplitudes is available ) is given by the time - delay matrix  @xcite , which is proportional to the sum of energy derivatives of all eigenphases .",
    "other factors , such as threshold openings can also produce rapid energy dependence .",
    "certainly the correct method of resonance identification requires the location of poles in the complex energy plane on unphysical sheets close to the physical region , which we demonstate below .",
    "our employment of the eigenphase approach illustrates the fact that resonance structure may vary with the appearance of resonances in different parametrizations without significantly altering the shape of the @xmath0 elastic amplitude .",
    "it is usually the case , however , that such resonances are deep in the complex plane having large widths .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : f3 ] , for illustration , we plot the sum of eigenphase energy derivatives for the @xmath80 and @xmath85 .",
    "the peaks for @xmath80 are nearly identical and occur at about 1350  mev , which ( we will see ) corresponds with the real part of the pole position . for the @xmath85 ,",
    "peaks corresponding the the 4-star state , near 1500  mev , are closely aligned .",
    "the second peak has almost no evidence in the @xmath0 elastic amplitude .",
    "however , a large contribution to the ( unfitted and therefore unconstrained ) @xmath101 or @xmath37 channels would result in the second peak .    in table  [",
    "tab : pole1 ] , we compare the pole positions associated with resonance behavior in the plotted amplitudes .",
    "the third @xmath7 pole in xp08 closely resembles the structure found in ref .",
    "@xcite , at @xmath102  mev , by scanning all partial waves with an added breit - wigner contribution .",
    "the very broad @xmath84 mev @xmath80 state is similarly close to one found in the sm90 fit  @xcite , at @xmath103  mev .",
    "two extra poles were found in the @xmath85 partial wave for the xp08 solution compared to wi08 . we do not intend to report the @xmath89  mev pole as a resonance but merely mention it here in connection with the present sensitivity study .",
    "interestingly , the pole at @xmath88  mev has its effect masked by a zero intervening between the pole and real energy axis and therefore makes little impact in the physical region .",
    "we have reported a study of the parameterization dependence of our @xmath0 elastic amplitudes and resonance spectrum , using a very different form for the cm @xmath1 matrix , with explicit poles in each partial wave .",
    "the partial - wave amplitudes were found to be very stable with the change .",
    "the eigenphase representation was introduced , mainly as a novel approach to resonance identification , and because it provides a more concrete example of properties discussed in older works .",
    "this discussion also provides a continuation of the study started in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the more formally correct extraction of pole positions has revealed structures mainly found in earlier fits to the @xmath0 elastic scattering data . as the partial wave amplitudes have not changed significantly , the effects of new resonances must be minimized through large widths , intervening zeros , or small coupling to the @xmath0 channel .    in the sm90 fit",
    ", a study of the resonance spectrum was tried where , in addition to experimental data , the amplitudes from the kh  @xcite and cmb  @xcite analyses were added as soft constraints .",
    "a possible extension to the present work would be a re - examination of the resonance spectrum from a fit , with explicit cm @xmath1-matrix poles , constrained to more closely follow either the kh and cmb analyses , or a multi - channel analysis .",
