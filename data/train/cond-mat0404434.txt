    "in two previous papers @xcite we have already discussed so - called wireless multihop ad hoc networks .",
    "they represent an engineered communication network , which reveals many facets of very intriguing and complex behavior . in this respect",
    "they fit nicely into the cross - disciplinary realm of the statistical physics of complex networks @xcite , which has already opened its doors for other communication networks like the internet , but also for biological and social networks .",
    "wireless multihop ad hoc networks represent an infrastructureless peer - to - peer generalization of todays wireless cellular phone networks . instead of being slaved to a central control authority ,",
    "each node not only sends or receives packets , but also forwards them for others .",
    "consequently , communication packets hop via inbetween ad hoc nodes to connect the initial sender to the final recipient .",
    "a lot of coordination amongst the nodes is needed for the overall network to perform well .",
    "they have to ensure network connectivity , good data - traffic performance and robustness against various forms of perturbations , just to name but the most important issues .",
    "because of this intrinsic coordination , wireless multihop ad hoc networks represent an excellent example of what is called a selforganizing network .",
    "however , their biggest challenge is yet to come , how to get selforganization to work .",
    "the connectivity issue has already been discussed quite extensively @xcite , also addressing interference effects @xcite . in one form or",
    "the other all these efforts relate to continuum percolation @xcite .",
    "an interesting distributive scheme has been put forward in @xcite , which turned out to be amazingly robust , guaranteeing strong network connectivity almost surely ; we will briefly touch upon this scheme again in sect.[subsec : twoa ] . ",
    "the robustness issue with respect to selfish users has received inspirations from the biological immune system and distributive algorithmic suggestions have been put forward @xcite .    as to data - traffic performance , estimates on the throughput , i.e.  the capacity of how much end - to - end traffic the network is able to handle without overloading , have been given .",
    "in @xcite a rigorous upper bound has been derived to scale with the square root of the network size .",
    "refined estimates have been given in @xcite , revealing that the scalability of the throughput depends on the underlying network structure .",
    "besides several other idealistic assumptions , these estimates have employed shortest - path routing .",
    "although several proactive and reactive routing schemes have already been discussed @xcite , we are not aware of any selfoptimizing scheme , which also accounts for congestion avoidance .    in this paper we will propose a prototype for such a highly wanted distributive and adaptive routing & congestion control .",
    "the idea is that every node keeps an estimate of how much it costs to send packets to final destinations and to update these estimates in a distributive manner .",
    "the latter can be achieved in a very elegant way without any additional exchange of control information .",
    "whenever a node is actively involved in a forwarding one - hop transmission , it silences its neighbors anyhow , so that those do not interfere on the shared wireless propagation medium .",
    "this blocking is called medium access control . upon blocking its neighbors ,",
    "the node is able to distribute its routing cost estimates and its congestion state to them , which those then use to update their cost estimates . in the technical jargon of engineers",
    ", this distributive scheme corresponds to a coupling of the medium access control layer with the routing layer .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "[ sec : two ] summarizes the key operational features of wireless multihop ad hoc networks , introduces plausible simplifications and describes the setup of generic simulations with random data traffic .",
    "shortest - path routing is used in sect .",
    "[ sec : three ] to investigate certain fingerprints of congestion like end - to - end time delay and single - node relaxation times . whenever possible , the numerical simulations are accompanied with analytic modeling .",
    "[ sec : four ] presents the details of the proposed distributive routing & congestion control and compares its results to those obtained with the shortest - path routing .",
    "the conclusion and a short outlook are given in sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we explain the key features of wireless multihop ad hoc networks hand in hand with some simplifications .",
    "the first simplification is to neglect mobility and to distribute @xmath0 nodes onto the unit square in a random and homogeneous way .",
    "then , according to a simple isotropic propagation - receiver model , a unidirectional link from node @xmath1 to node @xmath2 exists , if @xmath3 @xmath4 denotes the transmission power of node @xmath1 and @xmath5 represents the euclidean distance between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the path - loss exponent @xmath6 is assumed to be constant . without any loss of generality the variables @xmath7 and @xmath8",
    "are set equal to one .",
    "condition guarantees that @xmath2 is able to listen to @xmath1 , i.e.  @xmath9 . throughout this paper",
    "we will neglect the interference sum over other active nodes @xmath10 in the denominator of ; this is justified once @xmath6 is not too close to @xmath11 @xcite .    with these simplifications",
    ", wireless communication networks can be modeled as graphs @xmath12 , where @xmath13 refers to the set of nodes and @xmath14 to the set of links . in general these links in @xmath14 are directional links @xmath15 .",
    "the subset @xmath16 represents the complete set of all bidirectional links @xmath17 .",
    "although not strictly required , bidirectional links are preferred for the operation of wireless ad hoc networks because many communication protocols require instant feedback . the subset @xmath18 is called the communication neighbourhood of node @xmath1 and represents the complete set of nodes @xmath19 that all have bidirectional links @xmath20 in @xmath21 with node @xmath1 .",
    "the node degree @xmath22 of node @xmath1 is the number of nodes contained in @xmath23 . in a similar fashion @xmath24",
    "defines the set of nodes that have at least an unidirectional link @xmath15 from @xmath1 .",
    "a communication route or path is a sequence of nodes such that there are bidirectional links in @xmath21 between all consecutive pairs of nodes .",
    "a shortest path between two nodes @xmath25 is a route containing fewest possible number of nodes .",
    "the average length of all shortest paths over all node pairs @xmath1 , @xmath26 is refered to as the diameter @xmath27 of the network .",
    "one further step is needed in order to fully specify wireless multihop ad hoc network graphs : assignment of the transmission power @xmath28 for all nodes .",
    "most widley used is the constant transmission power rule , where the same transmission power @xmath29 is assigned to all nodes @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "all existing links are then bidirectional .",
    "once the transmission power is chosen such that @xmath31 , an average node will have @xmath32 bidirectional neighbors .",
    "this target degree has to be @xmath33 for a connected giant component to exist independent of the network size @xcite , but for the entire network to be strongly connected it needs to be larger @xcite .",
    "we adopt the value @xmath34 , which guarantees strong network connectivity almost surely for network sizes up to several thousands @xcite .",
    "we will call wireless multihop ad hoc network graphs generated with this power assignment as const-@xmath35 networks .    a different power assignment has been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is more energy efficient .",
    "it is based on a distributive assignment . in a nutshell",
    ", each node @xmath1 forces the @xmath36 closest nodes @xmath2 to adjust their transmission powers to @xmath37 , while adopting the value @xmath38 for itself .",
    "its own value can be increased further whenever another close - by node forces @xmath1 in return to have an even larger transmission power . in this respect",
    "each node has at least @xmath36 bidirectional neighbors .",
    "we adopt the value @xmath39 , which guarantees strong network connectivity almost surely for network sizes up to several thousand nodes @xcite .",
    "we will call wireless multihop ad hoc network graphs generated with this heterogeneous power assignment as minimum - node - degree networks .    fig .  [",
    "fig : pattern ] illustrates two random geometric graphs , one obtained with the const-@xmath35 assignment and the other with the minimum - node - degree assignment .",
    "we explicitely point out that the existence of links in @xmath14 is a direct result of the spatial positions and the transmission powers of the nodes . in that sense",
    "not every possible set of links @xmath14 can be realized by an appropriate power assignment .",
    "this is in clear contrast to any wired network where such restrictions do not influence the existence of connections between different nodes .      in order to study the statistical properties of data traffic on wireless multihop ad hoc networks , the generic simulation model as already presented in ref .",
    "@xcite has been applied . for the sake of illustration of the key mechanisms , we now give again a short outline .",
    "the simulation is based on discrete time steps . at the very beginning of a time step a new data packet of fixed size",
    "can be generated at each node @xmath30 with a probability @xmath40 , which is also referred to as the packet creation rate . in case of creation at a certain node @xmath1 , a destination @xmath26 is randomly chosen among @xmath41 and the packet is put at the end of @xmath1 s buffer queue , assumed to have infinite capacity .",
    "nodes , for which a new packet has been created , are blocked and are not involved in any further communication action for the remainder of this time step . during a short contention phase following the packet creation phase the non - blocked nodes with a non - zero queue compete for gaining sender status .",
    "a competing node @xmath1 is randomly picked first and obtains permission to transmit its first - in - line packet .",
    "it then makes a decision , to which neighbor @xmath42 the packet with final destination @xmath26 is forwarded . in its simplest form",
    ", this could be shortest - path routing or , in a more sophisticated form , routing depending on the congestion state . in order to reduce mutual interference within the shared communication medium , the sending as well as receiving node block their respective outgoing neighbors @xmath43 for the remainder of this time step ; this blocking is called medium access control ( mac ) .",
    "only then another node with non - zero queue that has not been blocked so far is chosen at random to attempt the transmission of its first - in - line packet . if the intended receiver has already been blocked before , the node tests its second - in - line packet and so on , until either the first idle recipient is found or the end of its queue is reached .",
    "this service discipline is denoted as first - in - first - possible - out .",
    "if this node succeeds to gain sender status , it then mac - blocks again its remaining outgoing neighbors as well as those of the receiving node .",
    "this iteration is repeated until no free one - hop transmissions are left .",
    "finally , all nodes with sending permission then submit their selected packet and remove it from their queue .",
    "the receiving nodes either add the incoming packet to the end of their queue or , if they are the final recipient , destroy the packet .",
    "a particular simple form of routing uses shortest paths with respect to the hop - metric . for the network to learn about the shortest routes all by itself , each node",
    "is required to flood discovery information into the whole network , collect the feedback and store those routes with the shortest hop distance . in principle degeneracy might occur , which would allow to pick the least - congested shortest path between initial sender @xmath1 and final recipient @xmath26 as a modest form of congestion control ; we will come back to this in sect .",
    "[ subsec : foura ] . for all of this section",
    "we prefer to discard degeneracy , pick one of the shortest degenerate paths at random and forward all packets originating in @xmath1 and destined for @xmath26 along it .",
    "this restriction allows for several analytical insights and points to the specific needs for improvement which a more sophisticated routing & congestion control has to take care of .",
    "we define the end - to - end ( e2e ) time delay of a packet to be the number of time steps between the generation at the originating node and the destruction at the final receiver .",
    "its temporal and network - ensemble average provides a measure of the network performance .",
    "the direct sampling of end - to - end times within the generic data traffic simulations implies a tagging of each packet with its creation time and is needed to extract respective distributions .",
    "although average e2e - time delays can also be determined via this route , an indirect sampling procedure is more efficient in that case . in the subcritical regime @xmath44 the average number @xmath45 of packets created within the overall network per time step must be equal to the number of packets delivered per unit time . since the average time a packet spends in the network is @xmath46 , we can assume that @xmath47 packets are delivered to their final destination per unit time , where @xmath48 represents the average total number of active packets after a stationary network state has been reached .",
    "this leads to little s law , @xmath49 well known in queuing theory @xcite .",
    "since the network size @xmath0 and the packet creation rate @xmath50 are known to us and @xmath51 is easily sampled , little s law allows for the indirect determination of the average end - to - end time delay .",
    "[ fig : te2e ] illustrates the average e2e - time delay as a function of the packet creation rate @xmath50 .",
    "as expected , it increases with the network load @xmath50 and diverges at the critical packet creation rate @xmath52 , which is a clear phase - transition - like sign that the system is about to leave its uncongested subcritical state and to enter its congested supercritical state for @xmath53 .",
    "we also observe that @xmath52 is different for the const-@xmath35 and the minimum - node - degree networks ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details on the dependence of the end - to - end throughput @xmath54 on the underlying network structure . in the limit",
    "@xmath55 the average e2e - time delay converges to the network diameter @xmath56 .",
    "although this observation is intuitively clear , we will give an analytic support in the next subsection .",
    "due to the differing network diameter , it appears that with respect to e2e - time delay the const-@xmath35 networks perform better than the minimum - node - degree networks .",
    "note however , that their respective parameters @xmath32 and @xmath36 have been chosen from the connectivity perspective only . a larger @xmath36 would lower the network diameter for the minimum - node - degree networks . in sect .",
    "[ subsec : threec ] we will present another form of performance comparison between the two network models .    the distribution @xmath57 of the e2e - time delay obtained from the generic data - traffic simulation with fixed shortest - path routing is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : constp24nodes100macb.delaytimes_fit ] .",
    "it is a network - wide distribution , which has been sampled over all generated packets .",
    "the employed const-@xmath35 network realization consists of @xmath58 nodes .",
    "safely inside the subcritical phase ( @xmath59 ) the sampled distribution can be fitted well with a generalized exponential @xmath60 however , for packet creation rates ( @xmath61 ) close to @xmath62 of the particular used network realization a log - normal distribution @xmath63 provides a better fit .",
    "the emergence of a log - normal distribution close to the critical packet creation rate appears to be an inherent feature of communication networks @xcite , when nodes are strongly and collectively coupled via heavy data traffic .",
    "the tendency to have a small but non - negligible number of packets with a rather high end - to - end time delay is an undesirable feature for communication networks .",
    "a suppression of this tail in the distribution of the end - to - end time delay is regarded as one goal of any advanced routing & congestion control .",
    "of course , another goal is to increase the critical packet creation rate .      in this subsection",
    "we give an analytic estimate of the mean end - to - end time delay .",
    "the starting point is little s law ( [ eq : littlelaw ] ) , which demands to model the average number @xmath64 of active data packets traveling on the network . upon assuming inter - node correlations to be small",
    ", we adopt the single - node picture and reduce @xmath65 to the modeling of a single - node queue length @xmath66 .",
    "the latter itself depends on the in- and out - flux rates @xmath67 and @xmath68 of data packets to node @xmath1 . if this turns out to be the only dependence , then the probability for node @xmath1 to have @xmath66 packets in its queue can be described by the rate equation @xmath69 reducing to the stationary limit @xmath70 and taking the boundary condition @xmath71 into account , its normalized solution is @xmath72 as a direct consequence , the relations @xmath73 and @xmath74 are derived , which will be of later use .",
    "we have carefully checked the assumption going into ( [ eq : bufferdistr1 ] ) ; see also @xcite .",
    "if the queue length distribution only depends on the in- and out - flux rates , which is filed as case @xmath75 in queuing theory @xcite , then the interarrival and sending times statistics should both obey the geometric distribution @xmath76 which comes with mean @xmath77 and reflects the independence of subsequent packet arrival and departure events .",
    "the interarrival time @xmath78 is defined as the time between two successive arrivals of data packets that are put at the end of node @xmath1 s queue .",
    "the sending time @xmath79 is defined as the time between two successive sending events from node @xmath1 to any of its neighboring nodes @xmath42 given that the queue is non - empty .",
    "[ fig : histo ] illustrates results obtained from the generic data traffic simulation , which show that , when focusing on a single node of an arbitrary network realization , the distributions of interarrival and sending time nicely follow the parameterization ( [ eq : interarrivaldistr ] ) for various packet creation rates and that the extracted in- and out - flux rates lead to a good agreement between the queue length distribution ( [ eq : bufferdistrfinal ] ) and its simulated counterpart .",
    "the modeling is now open for the in- and out - flux rates .",
    "we briefly outline the results , which have already been derived in a previous paper @xcite .",
    "the in - flux rate @xmath80 is proportional to the rate @xmath45 of newly created packets , of which the fraction @xmath81 will be routed via node @xmath1 during later time steps .",
    "the node inbetweeness @xmath82 and , equivalently , the link inbetweeness @xmath83 count the number of shortest paths , which go over node @xmath1 and link @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "the modeling of the out - flux rate @xmath85 is equivalent to the modeling of the mean sending time @xmath86 : @xmath87 the first sum in the first line represents those one - hop neighbors @xmath88 , which also want to transmit a packet at the same time .",
    "also two - hop neighbors @xmath89 contribute , once they have a packet to transmit to a one - hop neighbor , which would then mac - block node @xmath1 ; this is described by the last term of the first line . for the second step , eqs.([eq : nigeone ] ) and ( [ eq : muin ] )",
    "have been used , leading to @xmath0 coupled linear inhomogeneous equations for the sending times , which are then solved numerically for a given network realization .",
    "note , that the expression ( [ eq : muout ] ) overestimates the actual sending time to some extend , because one- and two - hop neighbors might have already been blocked by previously assigned one - hop transmissions .    upon putting eqs .",
    "( [ eq : littlelaw ] ) , ( [ eq : avgni ] ) , ( [ eq : muin ] ) and ( [ eq : muout ] ) together , an analytic estimate of the average end - to - end time delay can finally be given .",
    "it is interesting to mention two limiting cases . in the limit @xmath55 of very small packet creation rates ,",
    "the estimated sending times ( [ eq : muout ] ) converge to @xmath90 , so that the average end - to - end time delay becomes @xmath91 where the sum rule @xmath92 has been used to express the mean node inbetweeness in terms of the network diameter @xcite .",
    "this shows that for weak data traffic loads the network diameter determines the end - to - end time delay . in the other limit , @xmath93",
    ", the average end - to - end time delay is dominated by the most critical node .",
    "this node @xmath1 is the first , for which the in- and out - flux rates become identical and which determines the critical packet creation rate @xmath94 .",
    "the sum over all nodes @xmath95 breaks down and we arrive at @xmath96 in the last step we have made use of the fact that @xmath97 is bounded from above by the magnitude of node @xmath1 s one- and two - hop neighborhood . as the packet creation rate approaches @xmath98 , the number of packets within the network explodes to infinity .",
    "the critical exponent turns out to be @xmath99 .    for the const-@xmath35 and minimum - node - degree networks , the analytic estimate of the average end - to - end time delay",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : te2e ] and compared to the respective results obtained from the generic data traffic simulations .",
    "note that both the analytic as well as the simulation estimate have been averaged over a large sample of network realizations . for @xmath50 safely below @xmath98",
    "a good agreement is found . since the analytic estimate and the generic data - traffic simulation produce a slightly different @xmath98 , divergence of @xmath100 sets in at different @xmath50 , so that the quality of the comparison declines for @xmath50 close to @xmath98 .      instead of comparing the load - dependent end - to - end time delay between the two network models of fixed size , a comparison within a given network model , but of varying size allows to address the scalability issue .",

    "note also , that for each realization the critical packet creation rate fluctuates to some small degree . for a fixed @xmath101",
    "the end - to - end time delay increases with network size . in the limit",
    "@xmath104 this increase roughly scales as @xmath105 , which is in accordance with @xmath106 , reflecting the scaling behavior of the network diameter .    in order to make scalability statements also for @xmath107 ,",

    "in fact , the scaling ansatz ( [ eq : te2escaling ] ) leads to an excellent curve collapse , also shown as the lowest curve in fig.[fig : te2escaling](top)+(bottom ) : the solid curve corresponds to the right - hand side of ( [ eq : te2escaling ] ) with @xmath113 and the collapsing symboled curves correspond to the left - hand side of ( [ eq : te2escaling ] ) .",

    "more than this , it is also the enhanced time it takes in such cases to relax back to the mean .",
    "a long relaxation time would mean that the specific node as well as its surrounding part of the network stay in a congested state for quite some time .",

    "moreover , for network loads close to @xmath52 a good fraction of nodes belonging to the greater neighborhood of the critical one will also come with large queue lengths @xmath159 .",
    "this congestion cluster then gives rise to large average e2e - time delays and to large fluctuations of the latter , which in turn result in large relaxation times .",
    "it is the goal of any routing & congestion control to avoid such congested network areas and to detour the data traffic around .",
    "such actions are likely to be rewarded with an increase of the e2e - throughput capacity , a decrease of the average e2e - time delay as well as its fluctuations and the related relaxation times . in this section",
    "we discuss three different routing & congestion controls of increasing sophistication .",
    "the first one exploits the degeneracy of shortest e2e - routes .",
    "the other two approaches modify the distance metric to include each node s congestion state and adapt the routing decisions according to updated cost estimates , which are locally exchanged with every mac - blocking .",
    "the shortest - path ( sp ) routing used in sect .",
    "[ sec : three ] does not take advantage of the route degeneracy between an arbitrary sender and a final receiver . randomly choosing one out of several degenerate shortest routes for each new packet will already give some relief to the most congested nodes",
    "however , a bias on the actual congestion state would do even better .",
    "a simple extension in this direction is shortest - path shortest - queue ( spsq ) routing . instead of randomly choosing one next - hop neighbor out of",
    "the several degenerate shortest routes that specific node is picked which in addition has the shortest queue length in its buffer for this very moment .",
    "if more than one node qualifies , one of them is again picked randomly .",
    "note , that in order to make such a routing decision , the forwarding node needs to have information from its neighbors about their congestion state .",
    "a very elegant way to provide this information without sending additional control packets is to include it into the mac - blockings , in which the neighbors had been actively involved during previous one - hop transmissions .    as can be seen from figs .",
    "[ fig : constp24nodes100macb.compare_meandelay ] , [ fig : constp24nodes100macbpcs1.adaptive_delayhisto ] and [ fig : constp24nodes100macbpcs1.adaptive_queue.2point ] , the simple spsq routing & congestion control already leads to some noticeable improvements .",
    "the critical packet creation rate , where the average e2e - time delay diverges , increases . the tail of the e2e - time - delay distribution is suppressed to some extend .",
    "last but not least , also the correlation time scales have become smaller .",
    "if a node would have the complete information on the instantaneous congestion state of all other nodes belonging to the network , then it could determine the shortest route to the intended final recipient with a modified metric , which does not only take the hop distance into account , but also counts the queue lengths of all inbetween nodes .",
    "however , first of all the node does not have this information , and even if it would , then the shortest path at decision time needs not be equal to the shortest path for delivery due to the always changing congestion state of the network during delivery time @xmath100 . instead",
    ", the node could try to get some sort of cost estimate it takes to send the packet to the final destination via this or that neighbor , and to constantly update these estimates .",
    "this idea is already known as asynchronous vector distance routing @xcite and has found its way into internet routing at the autonomous - system level .",
    "next , we give an outline of this approach , modified and tuned to the specificity of wireless multihop ad hoc communication .",
    "pick a node @xmath1 that has a packet to forward to the final destination @xmath26 .",
    "node @xmath1 has to decide to which neighbor @xmath42 it is going to forward the packet .",
    "for each of them it has a cost estimate @xmath160 .",
    "it chooses node @xmath161 , providing the lowest cost estimate @xmath162 .",
    "before @xmath1 starts transmitting its packet to @xmath161 , it has to mac - block its neighbors .",
    "hand in hand with the blocking signal it tells them about the minimum cost @xmath163 and its future queue length @xmath164 .",
    "while then being blocked , those neighbors have enough time to process this information and update their estimated cost @xmath165 to send a packet via @xmath1 to @xmath26 during a future time step .",
    "@xmath166 is the cost to send a packet from @xmath2 to its neighbor @xmath1 .",
    "since the queue length @xmath164 is a reasonable measure of how busy node @xmath1 is @xcite , we set @xmath167 the one at the end takes care of the hop - distance between the two nodes . as the intended receiver of @xmath1 s to - be - transmitted packet , node @xmath161 also blocks its neighbors @xmath168 and takes this chance to inform those about its estimated cost @xmath169 and its future queue length @xmath170 .",
    "those neighbors then process this information analogous to ( [ eq : instantupdate ] ) , but with the modification @xmath171 for the future link cost .",
    "updating the estimated costs after receipt of an extended mac - signal appears to be a natural thing for wireless multihop ad hoc communication .",
    "it couples the mac - layer and the routing layer in a very elegant way and gives rise to a distributive congestion control .",
    "note that beyond mac  no additional congestion control signals have to be exchanged .",
    "this is in contrast to other communication networks like the internet , which first probe the congestion state with additional dedicated signals before they adapt to it .",
    "a few more technical words are in order .",
    "the congestion information distributed by the mac - signals may either include only those cost estimates belonging to the final destination of the currently transmitted packet , or it may include much more than this , namely the cost estimates to every single node of the network .",
    "both cases certainly represent two extremes , the former focusing on keeping the distributed signal small and the latter allowing for a faster spread of the congestion information over the entire network . for the remainder of this paper , we will only concentrate on the latter case .",
    "implementing the proposed congestion control for the generic data traffic simulations , requires to specify the initialization .",
    "the initial cost estimates have been set to @xmath172 the simulations themselves then have shown that for not - too - small packet creation rates the number of time steps it takes to distribute the initial cost estimates over the entire network and to reach a kind of steady state is of the order of the network size @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , test simulations have revealed that a relaxation of the deterministic lowest - cost - neighbor choice for forwarding the data packet , such that also the other higher - cost neighbors become eligible in some probabilistic form , always leads to a degradation in performance .",
    "the simulations of the generic data traffic for the routing & congestion control with the mac - distributed lowest - cost estimates ( maclce ) have turned out to be quite time - consuming .",
    "for this reason we present results only for one realization of a constant-@xmath35 network with size @xmath58 .",
    "the simulation run took @xmath173 time steps . as a function of the packet creation rate the average e2e - time delay",
    "is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : constp24nodes100macb.compare_meandelay ] . for moderate packet creation rates",
    "the various routing & congestion schemes sp , spsq and maclce perform about equally well , but when it comes to the critical regime , the control with mac - distributed lowest - cost estimates yields by far the largest critical packet creation rate .",
    "although more packets are present in the network , such a routing & congestion scheme is able to handle packet creation rates , exceeding the maximum rate obtained with the classical shortest - path routing by a factor of about @xmath174 .",
    "the inset of this figure shows the number of active packets @xmath175 for maclce at @xmath176 , indicated by the arrow .",
    "there is no linear dependence on time , which is a clear sign that the network is still operating in the subcritical regime .",
    "another goal for the new routing & congestion algorithm has been to reduce the pronounced tail in the distribution @xmath177 of the end - to - end time delay .",
    "[ fig : constp24nodes100macbpcs1.adaptive_delayhisto ] demonstrates that for @xmath61 , which is very close to the sp critical packet creation rate , the maclce and spsq distributions are about the same and , when compared to the sp distribution , come with a suppressed tail .",
    "note , that log - scales have been used in fig .",
    "[ fig : constp24nodes100macbpcs1.adaptive_delayhisto ] . for larger packet creation rates , where the sp and spsq schemes are already in the supercritical regime , the routing & congestion control with mac - distributed lowest - cost estimates results in rather flat distributions , which come with a relative sharp cutoff at larger end - to - end time delays",
    "of course , this cutoff increases with the network load .",
    "compared to the sp routing significant changes can be observed in the distribution @xmath178 for the single - node queue length ; see fig.[fig : constp24nodes100macbpcs1.adaptive_queue.buffer ] . at @xmath179",
    "the sp distribution is a broad exponential ( see also bottom of fig .  [",
    "fig : histo ] ) , whereas the maclce distribution is confined to basically @xmath180 . for larger packet creation rates",
    "the maclce distributions become bell - shaped .",
    "their mean and variance increase with @xmath50 .",
    "good fits can be obtained with a two - parametric continuous gamma distribution @xmath181 consult the inset figure . for maclce - controlled networks close to @xmath182",
    "this bell - shaped single - node queue - length distribution is a result of the flexible routing scheme , which adapts well to the current congestion state , and is key to their improved operational functionality .",
    "a direct consequence of the bell - shaped distributions @xmath178 is that @xmath183 .",
    "this then keeps the correlation function ( [ eq : corrfct ] ) close to one , even for small @xmath134 .",
    "thus with the packet creation rate approaching its critical limit , the single - node temporal correlations are expected to be drastically reduced .",
    "the simulation results illustrated in fig .   [ fig : constp24nodes100macbpcs1.adaptive_queue.2point ] confirm this view .",
    "so far the cost estimate @xmath160 of node @xmath1 is updated according to as soon as the neighboring node @xmath42 mac - reports its change of either @xmath184 or @xmath185",
    ". this immediate update might be too fast to be optimal .",
    "it could be wise to keep at least in parts some of the old cost estimate . introducing a kind of memory parameter @xmath186 , a proposition for",
    "a modified update rule would be @xmath187                  \\ ; .\\ ] ] for @xmath188 a fraction of the old cost estimate is kept as a part of the new estimate .",
    "this modification includes a memory of formerly used routes that are only updated if significant changes in the network s congestion state have occurred .",
    "this approach , which is inspired by reinforcement learning @xcite , is known as q - routing @xcite .",
    "the simple extension ( [ eq : pathupdatelearning ] ) proved to cause a small but clearly measurable further improvement in network performance .",
    "as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : constp24nodes100macb.compare_meandelay ] the memory - based mmaclce scheme with @xmath189 increases the critical packet - creation rate a little further when compared to the instantaneous maclce scheme with @xmath190 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath191 is the optimal choice . as a function of @xmath192 the critical packet creation rate first increases for values rising from @xmath190 to @xmath193 , takes its maximum at @xmath191 and then decreases for values above .",
    "it is intuitive that in case of a strong memory ( @xmath194 ) the update rule collapses and only keeps very old and out - fashioned cost estimates , which are not suited to adapt to the always changing congestion state of the network .",
    "this paper has focused on routing & congestion control in wireless multihop ad hoc communication networks .",
    "simulations with random data traffic have been accompanied with analytic estimates , whenever possible .",
    "the focus has first been on shortest - path routing , to understand certain data traffic characteristics like end - to - end time delay and correlation time scales , and to find fingerprints of congestion once the network is operating close to its critical load . a scaling law has been found for the average end - to - end time delay with respect to network size , which also revealed a dependence on the underlying network topology . in a second step and going beyond shortest - path routing , a distributive routing & congestion control has been proposed , which couples the mac- and routing layer of wireless multihop ad hoc communication . before one - hop forwarding a packet , the sending as well as receiving node mac - block their respective neighbors and distribute information about their congestion state and routing cost estimates , which the latter then use for updates .",
    "this distributive scheme turned out to be very efficient .",
    "compared to shortest - path routing , the critical network load increased noticeably .",
    "routes are constantly adapting to the prevailing congestion state of the network . with other words ,",
    "routes selforganize themselves .",
    "the proposed prototype routing & congestion control needs of course further testing and extensions .",
    "other than simple random data traffic has to be looked at , such as for example selfsimilar @xcite , self - organized - critical @xcite and spatially localized .",
    "congestion updates with different forms of cost metrics are important to investigate as well as the sparsity issue , i.e.  which information is important to be distributed to other nodes and which is negligible . at the end , the biggest challenge is yet to come , to turn provably good ideas into real - life - functioning implementations .",
