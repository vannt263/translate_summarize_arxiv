    "observations of high redshift quasars out to @xmath2 , and the lack of a strong hi absorption trough ( the so  called `` gunn  peterson '' , gp , trough ) have revealed that the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is highly ionized between redshifts @xmath3 . on the other hand , observations of the temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation , and the lack of a strong damping of these anisotropies by electron scattering ,",
    "have shown that the universe was neutral between the redshifts @xmath4 .",
    "it is natural to identify the first generation of galaxies or quasars as the sources of ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation that reionized the intergalactic medium at some redshift @xmath5 between @xmath6 ( e.g. haiman & loeb 1998 ) .",
    "how and when reionization happened , and the details of the reionization process , have been among the most pressing outstanding questions in astrophysical cosmology , likely holding many clues about the first generation of light sources .",
    "the bright quasar sdss 1030 + 0524 recently discovered in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) at redshift @xmath7 has revealed the first gp trough , i.e. , a spectrum consistent with no flux at a substantial stretch of wavelength shortward of @xmath8 .",
    "the lack of any detectable flux implies a strong lower limit @xmath9 on the mean mass  weighted neutral fraction of the igm at @xmath2 ( fan et al .",
    "furthermore , the neutral fractions inferred from a sample of high redshift quasars from @xmath10 show a rapid rise towards high redshift .",
    "comparisons with numerical simulations of cosmological reionization ( cen & mcdonald 2002 ; gnedin 2002 ; fan et al .",
    "2002 ) show that the igm is likely neutral at @xmath11 .",
    "it has long been suggested that the first sources of ultraviolet radiation , responsible for the reionization of the universe , could be strong ly@xmath0 emitters ( see the review by pritchet 1994 and references therein ) .",
    "indeed , numerous ly@xmath0 sources have recently been discovered at high redshifts ( dey et al .",
    "1998 ; weymann et al .",
    "1998 ; spinrad et al .",
    "1998 ; hu et al . 1999",
    "; ellis et al . 2001 ; rhoads & malhotra 2001 ; malhotra & rhoads 2002 ) .",
    "these discoveries demonstrate that ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies do exist in significant numbers out to the current horizon of their detectability at @xmath12 , despite the potentially strong susceptibility of ly@xmath0 photons to dust absorption ( charlot & fall 1993 ) .",
    "the observed space densities are broadly consistent with `` semi  analytical '' models that incorporate redshift - dependent dust obscuration , and connect ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies and dark matter halos ( haiman & spaans 1999 ) .",
    "the present paper is motivated by the recent discovery of a ly@xmath0 emitting galaxy at a redshift of @xmath1 ( hu et al .",
    "2002 ) , which is possibly _ prior _ to the reionization redshift of the igm .",
    "it has been pointed out that ly@xmath0 photons injected into a neutral igm are strongly scattered , and that the red damping wing of the gp trough can strongly suppress , or even completely eliminate the ly@xmath0 emission line ( miralda - escud 1998 ; miralda - escud & rees 1998 ; see also loeb & rybicki 1999 for a more detailed treatment of the scattering process ) .",
    "the reionization of the igm may therefore be accompanied by a rapid decline in the observed space density of ly@xmath0 emitters beyond @xmath5 ( haiman & spaans 1999 ) .",
    "indeed , such a decline could provide a useful observational probe of the reionization epoch in a large enough sample of ly@xmath0 emitters ( haiman & spaans 1999 ; rhoads & malhotra 2001 ) , complementary to methods utilizing the gp trough .    naively , the two recent observations mentioned above present a puzzle : a ly@xmath0 emission line is observed prior to the reionization epoch , where it should have been strongly suppressed . the simplest resolution of this puzzle is obtained by considering the cosmological hii region created by the ly@xmath0 source itself . as shown by cen & haiman ( 2001 ) and madau & rees ( 2001 ) , a source with a bright ionizing continuum can create a large ( @xmath13 comoving mpc ) cosmological hii region . for a sufficiently luminous source , the size of the hii region corresponds to a wavelength range @xmath14 that exceeds the width of the emission line , allowing most of the intrinsic ly@xmath0 line to be transmitted without significant scattering .",
    "motivated by the apparent recent observational puzzle , we here revisit this problem , and consider the effect of the igm on the intrinsic ly@xmath0 emission line of a _ faint _",
    "galaxy , such as the one discovered by hu et al .",
    "the ionizing continuum for this source is less than @xmath15 of that of the bright @xmath2 sdss quasars ( fan et al .",
    "we show that even for faint sources with such little ionizing continuum , a significant fraction of the emission line can remain observable . in particular , we argue that the ly@xmath0 line detected by hu et al .",
    "( 2002 ) is consistent with a source embedded in a neutral igm .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in   2 , we briefly summarize our model used to predict the line profile . in   3",
    ", we apply this model to the @xmath1 ly@xmath0 emitter . in   4 ,",
    "we study how the shape of the transmitted ly@xmath0 line depends on our model parameters . in   5 , we discuss our results and offer our conclusions . throughout this paper",
    ", we assume the background cosmology to be flat @xmath16cdm with @xmath17 .",
    "in this section , we describe our model for the effects of the igm on the observed ly@xmath0 emission line profile .",
    "this discussion closely parallels the treatment in cen & haiman ( 2001 ) , and is only briefly summarized here .",
    "consider an ionizing source at redshift @xmath18 with a given ( steady ) star formation rate @xmath19 and age @xmath20 .",
    "we assume the source is embedded in an initially neutral igm with a mean density of @xmath21 , and a mean gas clumping factor of @xmath22 .",
    "we first compute the size of the ionized region around the source . ignoring any recombinations",
    ", the radius of the `` strmgren sphere '' is @xmath23 ( proper ) mpc , where we have used the fact that over its lifetime , a stellar population with a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) extending from 0.1 to 120 @xmath24 produces @xmath25 ionizing photons per stellar proton , and equated the number of photons to the number of hydrogen atoms inside @xmath26 .",
    "this is accurate for low clumping factors and source ages , but recombinations can decrease the size @xmath26 for ( @xmath27 , or @xmath28 yrs ) .",
    "the results presented below are obtained by a numerical solution that accounts for recombinations .    for simplicity ,",
    "we assume further that the source emits a ly@xmath0 line with a thermally broadened profile , so that the unobscured flux at observed wavelength @xmath29 is @xmath30 ^ 2/\\delta\\lambda^2\\}$ ] , where @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the apparent doppler width at thermal velocity @xmath33 .",
    "the observed line profile at wavelength @xmath29 will then be @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the optical depth to ly@xmath0 absorption . in the last integral , @xmath36 is the neutral hydrogen number density along the line of sight to the source , and @xmath37 is the ly@xmath0 cross  section ( assumed here to be given by a voigt profile , using temperatures of @xmath38k and @xmath39 ^ 2$]k inside and outside the hii region , respectively ) .",
    "the intrinsic ly@xmath0 emission line is reprocessed by the opacity of the intervening neutral igm , as well as by the residual neutral hydrogen within the strmgren sphere .",
    "we here assume that outside the hii region , the igm is fully neutral , and @xmath40 . inside the hii region , we explicitly compute the neutral fraction as a function of redshift ( or distance from the source ) , by equating the ionizing flux to the recombination rate , assuming that the latter is boosted relative to a uniform igm by the value of the gas clumping factor @xmath41 .",
    "the value of the clumping factor , and the shape of the density distribution , have little effect on the transmission on the red side of the line , but it does effect the transmission on the blue side of the line ( see discussion below ) .",
    "the galaxy hcdm 6a was found in a narrow  band imaging survey behind the cluster abell 370 with the lris camera on the keck 10 m telescopes ( hu et al .",
    "it is an intrinsically faint source , and was detected through its gravitational lensing magnification by a factor of @xmath42 . broad ",
    "band optical and near  infrared imaging was used to infer a star formation rate of 40 @xmath43 .",
    "subsequent lris spectroscopy revealed a ly@xmath0 line , with the inferred redshift of @xmath44 .",
    "the star formation rate inferred from the line using kennicutt s ( 1983 ) law is 2 @xmath45 , approximately @xmath46 times smaller than implied by the continuum flux .",
    "the fact that the emission line is underluminous may indeed be an indication that a fraction of the line was scattered by the neutral igm ( although there are other plausible explanations , such as dust absorption , or a large escape fraction of ionizing photons from the galaxy , as discussed below ) .",
    "taking the observed parameters of this source , we now use the model in the previous section to predict the transmitted shape of the emission line .",
    "we adopt the star  formation rate of @xmath47 as inferred from the observed continuum ( translating to an ionizing photon production rate of @xmath48 ) .",
    "we adopt an intrinsic thermal line  width of @xmath49 and source redshift of @xmath50 ; as we will see below , this pair of choices roughly reproduces the width ( fwhm @xmath51 ) , and peak wavelength ( @xmath52 ) of the observed line once the igm opacity is taken into account .",
    "we further assume an age of @xmath53 yr for the source , a gas clumping factor of @xmath54 , and an escape fraction for the ionizing photons of @xmath55 .",
    "the resulting size of the hii region under these assumptions is 0.3 proper mpc ( or 2 comoving mpc ) .",
    "reasonable variations on the assumed parameters do not change our main conclusions , as discussed below .",
    "the upper panel of figure  [ fig : spec ] shows the resulting profile of the ly@xmath0 emission line . the top solid curve shows the assumed unabsorbed line profile , normalized to have a peak flux of unity ( in arbitrary units ) .",
    "the bottom solid curve shows the profile including the opacities of both the igm and the neutral atoms within the hii region . in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : spec ]",
    ", we show the separate contributions to the total hi opacity ( solid curve ) from within the hii region ( short - dashed curve ) and from the neutral igm ( dotted curve ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : spec ] reveals that at the center of the ly@xmath0 line , the opacity is only of order unity ( @xmath56 ) . on the blue side of the line ,",
    "the opacity is dominated by the residual neutral hydrogen inside the hii region , and is significantly higher , while on the red side of the line , the opacity is dominated by the damping wing of the igm , and falls below unity .",
    "the most important point revealed by this figure is that the opacities are not exceedingly large , and a significant fraction of the intrinsic line flux is transmitted .",
    "the peak flux is reduced by a factor of @xmath57 relative to its unabsorbed value , and @xmath58 of the total intrinsic line flux is transmitted .",
    "this is consistent with the finding by hu et al . that the line is underluminous by a factor of @xmath59 compared to what is expected from the continuum , and allows an additional suppression of the total line flux by @xmath60 ( e.g. by dust ) .",
    "we have so far implicitly assumed that the transmitted flux equals @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the unobscured flux , and @xmath63 is the mean hi opacity .",
    "this should be a reasonable assumption for the damping wing of the igm , since a large range of redshifts @xmath64 contribute to the opacity at any given wavelength .",
    "density fluctuations along the line of sight will therefore average out to result in the mean opacity .",
    "however , on the blue side of the line , the opacity at a given observed wavelength is dominated by a narrow redshift interval , corresponding to the thermal width ( @xmath65 km / s ) around the redshift at which the photons pass the through the ly@xmath0 resonance . as a result ,",
    "depending on the spectral resolution , there could be significant opacity fluctuations within a single spectral resolution element . in this case , the observed flux would be better approximated by @xmath66 , where the average is taken over the probability distribution of @xmath67 .",
    "this follows directly from the density distribution , which we here assume is log  normal ( which has only one free parameter , @xmath41 ) , together with the fact that within the hii region , where ionization equilibrium is rapidly established , @xmath68 .    in general",
    ", @xmath69 can be much larger than @xmath70 , implying that we may have significantly _ underestimated _ the transmission on the blue side of the line . to illustrate this effect , in figure  [ fig : spec ]",
    "we show the line profile using @xmath71 as the effective opacity of the neutral hydrogen inside the hii region .",
    "the long - dashed curve in the lower panel shows that this reduces the opacity by a factor of @xmath72 , and that the damping wing of the igm now dominates the opacity across the entire profile .",
    "the long  dashed curve in the upper panel show the transmitted line shape .",
    "the reduced opacity makes the line appear more symmetric , and slightly increases the total transmitted flux .",
    "we also note that `` extreme '' gas clumping could reduce the transmitted flux , by reducing the size of the hii region around the source",
    ". this could be the case if the galaxy hcdm 6a is situated in a large  scale density condensation . in particular , one may assume that the galaxy is part of a larger halo with an nfw ( navarro , frenk & white 1997 ) density profile , in which the gas has an extended distribution with a hot and cold component in pressure equilibrium .",
    "under these assumptions , it would require implausibly large star formation rates to ionize the gas in the halo , and there would be no cosmological hii region outside the local halo ( see haiman & rees 2001 ) . the fact that the galaxy hcdm 6a does show ly@xmath0 emission suggests that it is not surrounded by such a large scale gas distribution , i.e. most of the gas had to cool and assemble into a disk , or into neutral clumps with a low covering factor .",
    "to address how the results of the previous section depend on the parameters of our model , figure  [ fig : sfr ] shows various properties of the processed ly@xmath0 emission line for sources with different star formation rates .",
    "note that a change in the lifetime of the source ( until its strmgren sphere approaches its equilibrium size ) , or in the escape fraction of ionizing photons , is essentially equivalent to changing the star formation rate , since what matters most for the transmitted spectrum is the overall size of the hii region .",
    "we use an emission line at @xmath1 with an unobscured line  width of @xmath73 , and a pure gaussian intrinsic profile , as an illustrative example ; and we also set @xmath74 .    as the sfr",
    "is decreased , the source becomes fainter , and larger parts of the ly@xmath0 line are obscured .",
    "this is demonstrated on the four panels of figure  [ fig : sfr ] .",
    "the upper left panel shows that as the sfr is decreased , the central wavelength of the line appears to shift towards the red , by upto @xmath75 .",
    "the upper right panel shows that the flux at the apparent peak of the line decreases by upto a factor of @xmath59 .",
    "interestingly , even in the absence of any hii regions ( e.g. for a very faint source ) , the transmitted flux at the apparent line center is still @xmath76 of the peak flux of the unobscured line . in the lower left panel ,",
    "we show the `` asymmetry '' in the line profile , which we define as the ratio of the transmitted fluxes on the blue vs. red side of the apparent line - center .",
    "apparently , as the size of the hii region is decreased , the line becomes first increasingly asymmetric .",
    "however there is a maximum in the asymmetry at a star formation rate of around @xmath77 , and for still lower emissivities , the line would appear increasingly symmetric again . finally , the lower right panel shows how the total transmitted line flux depends on the star formation rate .",
    "the total line flux decreases by upto a factor of @xmath78 , but interestingly , even in the absence of any hii region , the total transmitted line flux still contains @xmath79 of its unobscured value .",
    "the dashed lines in figure  [ fig : sfr ] correspond to the case in which gas clumping with a log  normal density distribution inside the hii region reduces the effective opacity , as discussed in the previous section .",
    "this does not effect the location or height of the observed peak , and only slightly increases the total transmitted flux .",
    "however , it does significantly reduce the asymmetry of the line .",
    "the assumed intrinsic width of the ly@xmath0 line can significantly effect the above results . in figure",
    "[ fig : width ] , we show how the apparent line center , peak flux , asymmetry , and total line flux depend on the assumed width @xmath33 .",
    "the set of curves marked by vertical lines correspond to a model with @xmath80 and a corresponding proper hii region size of 0.6 mpc .",
    "the other set of curves describe the parameters of the ly@xmath0 line in a model without any hii region .",
    "the figure shows that intrinsically broader lines are less effected by the igm opacity .",
    "in particular , the lower solid curve in the bottom right panel indicates that for a line broader than @xmath81 km / s , @xmath82 of the intrinsic flux is transmitted even in the absence of any hii region .",
    "conversely , for intrinsic line widths significantly narrower than @xmath83 km / s , significant flux can remain only if the source is surrounded by an hii region whose size is at least @xmath84 ( proper ) mpc .",
    "we have shown that a significant fraction of the intrinsic ly@xmath0 line of a galaxy should be detectable , even for faint galaxies embedded in a neutral igm .",
    "this implies that contrary to previous suggestions , ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies should be observable from beyond the reionization redshift . in particular , the emission line detected by hu et al .",
    "is consistent with a galaxy embedded in a neutral igm . using the star formation rate of 40 @xmath43 inferred from the continuum of this source , and assuming an escape fraction of ionizing photons @xmath55 , and age of @xmath85 years",
    ", we find that it should be surrounded by an ionized region of size @xmath86 ( comoving ) mpc . in this case , @xmath87 of the intrinsic line flux is transmitted , consistent with the measured line strength if dust , or local neutral gas , has absorbed an additional @xmath88 of the line .    in general , the observed line profiles for sources prior to reionization should have properties that correlate with the size of the local hii region , and therefore with the luminosity of the source . for an illustrative example of a thermal emission line with a width of @xmath89 at redshift @xmath1 , we have demonstrated how the observed shape depends on the star formation rate of the source .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : sfr ] , and also strongly depend on the intrinsic line  profile , as shown in figure  [ fig : width ] .",
    "for example , for a line as narrow as @xmath59 km / s , the maximum apparent redward displacement of the line  center ( in the absence of an hii region ) would be @xmath90 , rather than @xmath91 , and for a star formation rate of @xmath92 @xmath43 , the line would essentially be erased , with less than a fraction of @xmath93 of the total line flux transmitted .",
    "on the other hand , for a line as broad as @xmath94 km / s , the maximum displacement could be upto @xmath95 , and @xmath96 of the total flux would be transmitted even for arbitrarily faint sources .",
    "the parameters of the transmitted line shape for other values of the assumed intrinsic linewidth and sfr can be read off figures [ fig : sfr ] and [ fig : width ] .",
    "we conclude that relatively faint ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies should be observable from epochs prior to the reionization of the universe .",
    "a statistical sample of ly@xmath0 emitters that spans the reionization redshift should be a useful probe of reionization , through the study of the correlations between the luminosity of the sources and the properties of the emission lines , such as their total line / continuum ratio ( if a continuum is measured ) , the asymmetry of the line profile , and the offset of the peak of the line from the central ly@xmath0 wavelength ( for sources that have redshift measurements from other emission lines ) .",
    "these studies will serve as a useful complement to probing the reionization of the igm through observations of the gp trough in the spectra of distance quasars , or through observations of the cmb anisotropies .",
