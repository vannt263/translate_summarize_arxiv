    "the co - location of these sources suggests that the accuracy of the jcmt pointing for these observations is within a few seconds of arc , and splitting the scuba-2 data in half yields two images with similar structure .",

    "an alternative possibility is extra - galactic confusion ; given about @xmath15 galaxies degree@xmath16 brighter than 5 mjy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "thus , the star - centred emission could arise from a galaxy with @xmath20.2% probability , or the offset peak could arise from a galaxy with 2% probability . in the latter case the star - centred emission still requires an explanation , and adding a second galaxy lowers the probability significantly .",
    "thus , in either case it is unlikely that the emission located at the stellar position originates from a background galaxy .",
    "given the small chance of contamination from background galaxies , and that some contribution from the orion complex is likely , we consider the scuba-2 emission a probable detection of emission associated with hd  38858 .",

    "these radial constraints on the dust location are similar for other compositions , for example the possibility that the grains contain carbon is motivated by the higher sublimation temperature .",
    "the constraint moves inwards somewhat for compositions where @xmath83 at 24 @xmath3 m relative to h - band becomes larger than the example here ( e.g. due to a strong spectral feature for small silicate grains ) .",

    "is very good , finding significant fluxes ( i.e. an excess ) , but notably leaves residuals on either side of the star at 100 @xmath3 m , which is the deepest image .",
    "we therefore allow the disc component to be resolved , modelling it as a simple narrow ring of width 5 au with free parameters of disc radius , inclination , and position angle .",
    "the best fitting resolved disc model is shown in the two rightmost columns of fig .",
    "[ fig:20794mods ] , where the fourth column shows the disc model at high resolution , and the fifth column shows the residuals for this model .",

    "given that both 61  vir and hd  38858 host discs with significant radial extent , we can consider what the observations rule out for such extended discs around hd  20794 .",
    "by analogy with the two - belt model for hd  38858 , we added a second 5 au wide belt at a radius of 50 au to the resolved hd  20794 model . to remain undetected the optical depth in this belt must be less than about half the value in the inner belt . for hd  38858",

    "the approximate location is indicated by the hatched region.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    contrasting the four systems , most notable is that hd  69830 does not possess a significant level of cool dust , suggesting that this system evolved in a different way to the other three , and that the dust at 1 au is perhaps short - lived and directly linked to one or more of the three planets .",
    "this system has been discussed extensively elsewhere , so here we focus on the remaining three .",
    "our main goal is to explore links between the planets and the disc structure , whether these links provide potentially useful information about the system histories , and which observations are needed to distinguish among different possibilities .",
    "we first highlight some relevant similarities and differences among these three systems : the discs around hd  20794 , 61  vir , and hd  38858 have similar inner radii of around 20 - 30 au , and ( assuming that the minimum masses are similar to the true planet masses ) the planets around 61  vir and hd  38858 are more massive than those around hd  20794 .",
    "the discs around 61  vir and hd  38858 extend to large radii ( @xmath17100 au ) , and while the constraints are much poorer , the above modelling shows that the hd  20794 disc is at least relatively depleted outside @xmath230 au . from the seds and images of 61  vir and hd  38858",
    "we can also be confident that the regions inside @xmath230 au are significantly depleted of debris compared to the levels seen between 30 - 200 au .",
    "being very faint and marginally resolved at best , the relative constraints for hd  20794 on the regions inside the detected belt at @xmath220 au are poor .",
    "ideally we would like to link the properties of the known planets with the observed disc structure , thus avoiding the invocation of unseen planets with uncertain properties .",
    "secular perturbations provide one way that planets can reach over large radial distances and affect planetesimal belts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , the secular perturbation timescale for the outermost planet to affect the disc inner edge is @xmath1710 gyr for all three systems , so such a link is not possible given the current orbits of the known planets .    in the absence of strong effects from secular perturbations",
    ", we can still make a speculative link between the masses of the known planets and the radial width of the discs , which are larger for the two discs in systems with more massive planets .",
    "super - earths may have difficulty forming in situ , so could have formed farther out where the discs are observed ( i.e. near 20 au ) , imprinted some structure on the disc , and then migrated inwards to their observed locations . in this kind of scenario the planet mass dependence of the disc radial width arises because more massive planets excite planetesimals to greater eccentricities .",
    "that is , at least the outer planets around hd  20794 , 61  vir , and hd  38858 all formed near the observed inner disc edges , but the @xmath1710 @xmath0 outer planets around 61  vir and hd  38858 were better able to scatter planetesimals onto eccentric orbits compared to the @xmath10010 @xmath0 planets around hd  20794 . the depletion of disc material between the current planet and disc locations is explained in this scenario by i ) the use of this material to form the observed planets , and/or ii ) the shepherding of this material inwards as the super - earths migrated towards the star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    by analogy with the solar system , the radial width of the discs around 61  vir and hd  38858",
    "would therefore be interpreted as arising from `` scattered disc''-like populations of planetesimals on eccentric orbits .",
    "a prediction of this scenario is that the radial width of the disc as observed in small dust with _",
    "herschel _ is a property inherited from the larger planetesimals , and therefore that the disc extent should also appear to be wide when larger grains that are less affected by radiation forces are imaged at mm wavelengths .",
    "this appearance would be in contrast to discs such as @xmath1 pic and au  mic , where the planetesimals occupy a relatively narrow `` birth ring '' and the small grains that are strongly affected by radiation forces reside in a wider halo @xcite .    while this scenario is convenient in that it does not require undetected planets at larger semi - major axes , it is by no means unique and the sensitivity limits in figs .",
    "[ fig : rvlim ] and [ fig : sys ] show that the constraints allow @xmath10110 - 20 @xmath0 planets beyond about 5 au , and @xmath17saturn - mass planets beyond 10 au.gyr-old giant planets is poor ; only hd  69830 has been observed recently , and was targeted based on the presence of the disc @xcite . ] given the total mass of solids in a `` typical '' planet - forming disc is roughly 10 - 100 @xmath0 , and the gas mass @xmath2100 times greater , the existence of more planets is certainly possible given the mass budget .",
    "another possible scenario is therefore that the known planets formed closer to the star , or at least from material that originated closer to the star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and that extra planets may ( or may not ) exist in the regions where the rv limits are poor . in this case",
    "any links between the masses of the known super - earths and the disc structure would be far more tenuous , and likely non - existent . an obvious question is then whether undetectable planets are responsible for the different radial widths and the disc depletion inside 20 au , and which signatures can distinguish planet formation and/or planet clearing from other depletion scenarios .",
    "firstly , planets are not necessarily needed to clear the inner disc regions .",
    "most simply it may be that planetesimal formation was less efficient in the 5 - 20 au region than elsewhere and that these regions are naturally empty . in the event that planetesimals did form in this region , @xcite",
    "show that the disc around 61  vir may simply be collisionally depleted from the inside out , and given the uncertain stellar ages , the same argument can be applied to hd  20794 and hd  38858 .",
    "this scenario predicts a characteristic slope for the brightness of the disc inner edge .",
    "the main prediction if the inner disc edges are instead truncated by unseen planets is that the edge should be sharper than for collisional depletion @xcite , and that any relation between the known planet masses and the disc extent is coincidental .",
    "the best way to tell how the inner disc regions were depleted is therefore to resolve the inner disc edge , a task best suited to high resolution optical or interferometric mm imaging ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the radial disc extent may of course also be related to the masses of these unseen planets , but unless these planets are detected or inferred to exist there is little power to tell whether their influence on the width was significant .",
    "however , their possible presence highlights other scenarios .",
    "the scattered disc component of the kuiper belt formed as planetesimals were scattered by the outward migration of neptune @xcite , providing an alternative explanation for the wider extent of the discs around 61  vir and hd  38858 noted above , but no reason ( aside from lower planet masses or the lack of such a process ) for the narrower belt around hd  20794 .",
    "the additional planets required in this scenario would be very difficult to detect , so a key signature that would distinguish among these scenarios is that outward migration captures planetesimals in mean motion resonances @xcite , with the resultant clumpy structures expected to be detectable in high resolution sub - mm images .    in summary",
    ", the greater disc radial widths and planet masses around 61  vir and hd  38858 compared to hd  20794 are suggestive of a link between the two ; the wider extent may be a signature of a scattered disc population of planetesimals that was excited by the planets before they migrated to their current locations .",
    "being based on three systems this scenario is clearly speculative and other scenarios are of course also possible , so such ideas provide general motivation for further characterisation of these and other systems .",
    "in particular , high resolution observations that measure the shape of the inner disc edges and any azimuthal asymmetries will provide the best constraints on the structure and origins of these systems .",
    "we present _ herschel _ and jcmt observations of the debris discs in the sun - like planet hosting systems hd  38858 and hd  20794 .",
    "the hd  38858 disc is well resolved and spans a wide range of radii , from approximately 30 - 50 au to 130 - 200 au depending on whether the dust lies in two narrow rings or a wide continuous belt .",
    "we present a probable 850 @xmath3 m imaging detection of the disc and set an upper limit on the level of co j=2 - 1 emission .",
    "the hd  20794 disc appears robust photometrically , but is marginally resolved at best .",
    "the disc has a probable radius of a few tens of au and is among the faintest known , with dust levels roughly one order of magnitude above the edgeworth - kuiper belt in the solar system . using the non - detection of excess emission at 24 @xmath3",
    "m we show that the hot dust seen with near - ir interferometry probably lies interior to the innermost planet at 0.1 au .    with the addition of 61  vir and hd  69830",
    ", we consider the sample of four nearby g - type stars with low - mass planets and debris disc detections .",
    "we present new limits on undiscovered planets in these systems using harps radial velocity data , showing that regions beyond about 5 au may contain undiscovered @xmath10130 @xmath0 planets . with the exception of hd  69830 ,",
    "the detected disc components lie well beyond the known planets in these systems and various different scenarios can explain the observed system structure . a scenario that does not invoke additional planets",
    "is that the extent of the observed discs around hd  20794 , 61  vir , and hd  38858 is related to the mass of the planets , which are greater around the latter two stars .",
    "other scenarios are possible however , and high resolution imaging that can determine the shape of the disc inner edges , and the extent of the parent planetesimals , will help distinguish among them .",
