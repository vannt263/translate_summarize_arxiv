    "this provides a motivation for studying discrepancy with respect to various test sets in the cube .",
    "we explain how numerical integration in the unit cube using equal weight quadrature rules leads one to discrepancy with respect to anchored boxes @xmath20 .",
    "a simple explanation in one dimension is the following .",
    "assume that @xmath21 is absolutely continuous and let @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "we have @xmath23 and therefore @xmath24 { \\mathrm{\\ , d}}t = \\\\ & \\int_0 ^ 1 f'(t ) \\delta_{p_{n,1}}(t ) { \\mathrm{\\ , d}}t,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the local discrepancy function given by @xmath26 using hlder s inequality we therefore get @xmath27 for hlder conjugates @xmath28 , with the obvious modifications for @xmath29 or @xmath30 .",

    "again , a number of results are known about the isotropic discrepancy due to beck  @xcite , hlawka  @xcite , laczkovich  @xcite , mck and philipp  @xcite , niederreiter  @xcite , niederreiter and wills  @xcite , schmidt  @xcite , stute  @xcite , zaremba  @xcite . in dimension",
    "@xmath59 it is known that @xmath60 whereas in dimension @xmath61 we have @xmath62 using known constructions of point sets with small star - discrepancy , one obtains the upper bound @xmath63 the construction of the point sets is explicit in this case .",
    "however , there is a gap between the upper and lower bound and the precise rate of convergence remains unknown .    in the next section we consider numerical integration over the unit sphere .",
    "a natural way to define test sets that takes the symmetry of the unit sphere @xmath64 into account is to use spherical caps .",
    "spherical caps with center @xmath65 and height @xmath66 are defined by @xmath67 let @xmath68 denote the set of spherical caps .",
    "the spherical cap @xmath31 discrepancy is now given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the normalized surface lebesgue measure on the sphere @xmath71 . as in the cube case , the spherical cap discrepancy is related to numerical integration of functions on the sphere .",
    "the koksma - hlawka type inequality is of the form @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a suitable function norm , see brauchart and d.  @xcite .",
    "bounds on the spherical cap discrepancy have been established by beck  @xcite , schmidt  @xcite and stolarsky  @xcite .",
    "it is known that @xmath74 however , the upper bound is based on probabilistic arguments and there are no known optimal explicit constructions satisfying this upper bound .",
    "a number of non - optimal results follow from the work of grabner and tichy  @xcite , lubotzky , philipps and sarnak  @xcite and aistleitner , brauchart and d.  @xcite .",
    "we briefly discuss the explicit constructions of points on the sphere @xmath75 from aistleitner , brauchart and d.  @xcite .",
    "the idea there is to use a transformation from the square @xmath4 ^ 2 $ ] to the sphere @xmath75 which preserves the measure .",
    "the so - called lambert transform @xmath76 ^ 2 \\to \\mathbb{s}^2 $ ] given by @xmath77 has this property , i.e. , for any lebesgue measurable set @xmath78 ^ 2 $ ] we have @xmath79 , where @xmath80 .    in order to obtain points on the sphere @xmath75 , we proceed in the following way .",
    "we map the points @xmath81 ^ 2 $ ] to @xmath82 .",
    "it was shown in aistleitner , brauchart and d.  @xcite that if @xmath83 have low ` discrepancy ' with respect to anchored boxes in the square , then @xmath84 have low spherical cap discrepancy .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows some numerical results of a digital net mapped to the sphere @xmath75 .",
    "the result indicates that these point sets achieve the optimal rate of convergence of the spherical cap @xmath85 discrepancy .",
    "the dashed lines show @xmath86 and @xmath87 , and the curve shows the squared spherical cap @xmath85 discrepancy , where the quadrature points are a digital net mapped to the sphere . ]",
    "first note that the optimal rate of convergence for boxes in the square differs from the optimal rate of convergence for spherical caps on the sphere .",
    "this is not surprising when considering the inverse sets of spherical caps @xmath88 ^ 2 : \\phi({\\boldsymbol{z } } ) \\in c({\\boldsymbol{x}},t)\\}$ ] .",
    "these sets have particular shapes which change as @xmath65 and @xmath66 vary .",
    "they are not convex , however , they can be broken up into a small number of convex parts and parts whose complement with respect to some rectangle is convex .",
    "their boundary is smooth except for the pole caps where @xmath65 is either the north pole @xmath89 or south pole @xmath90 , in which case @xmath91 is a rectangle .",
    "the curvature of the boundary is unbounded , which can be seen when @xmath65 moves to one of the poles where the smooth boundary curve of @xmath91 turns into a rectangle .",
    "thus the sets @xmath91 do not have any discernible features . however , for most sets @xmath91 , the boundary is smooth and has bounded curvature .",
    "thus , for the most part , the sets @xmath92 can be described by convex sets with smooth boundary which has bounded curvature .    in the following we briefly discuss discrepancy in the cube with respect to convex test sets with smooth boundary , since the problem of the discrepancy of points mapped to the sphere using the lambert transform",
    "is , to a large degree , related to this discrepancy .",
    "we consider now the star - discrepancy in the torus @xmath93 with respect to the convex test sets @xmath94 , whose boundary curve is twice continuously differentiable with minimal curvature divided by maximal curvature bounded away from 0 .",
    "it was shown by beck and chen  @xcite that @xmath95 a generalization to arbitrary dimension can be found in drmota  @xcite , which shows that @xmath96 the discrepancy bounds for this case are very similar to the discrepancy bounds for the spherical cap discrepancy on @xmath71 . as in the sphere case , no explicit constructions of point sets achieving the upper bound on the discrepancy with respect to convex sets with smooth boundary is known . indeed , a solution of one of these problems may also yield a solution to the other problem .",
    "the numerical results for the spherical cap @xmath85 discrepancy may indicate that classical low - discrepancy constructions such as digital nets and fibonacci lattices are optimal .",
    "hence the question arises whether this is also true for the discrepancy in the square with respect to convex sets with smooth boundary , as studied by beck and chen  @xcite .",
    "assume now we want to approximate the integral @xmath97 where @xmath98 is a probability density function on @xmath99 . in some cases there",
    "is a mapping @xmath76^s \\to \\mathbb{g}$ ] which is measure preserving in the following sense : for every lebesgue measurable set @xmath100^s$ ] we have @xmath101 see the inverse rosenblatt transform  @xcite , or the monographs by devroye  @xcite and hrmann , leydold and derflinger  @xcite . in the previous section we saw an example of this situation , however such problems come up in other contexts as well ( see for instance kuo , dunsmuir , sloan , wand , and womersley  @xcite for an example in the context of quasi - monte carlo integration ) .",
    "now assume that we want to study discrepancy with respect to boxes in @xmath102 .",
    "let @xmath103^s$ ] .",
    "then we can define the discrepancy @xmath104}(\\phi({\\boldsymbol{x}}_n ) ) -",
    "\\int_{g \\cap [ -\\boldsymbol{\\infty } , { \\boldsymbol{t } } ] } \\psi({\\boldsymbol{x } } ) { \\mathrm{\\ , d}}{\\boldsymbol{x}}\\right|.\\ ] ] this discrepancy can be translated to a discrepancy in the unit cube @xmath105 where @xmath13 consists of all sets @xmath106^s : \\phi({\\boldsymbol{x } } ) \\in g \\cap [ { \\boldsymbol{0 } } , { \\boldsymbol{t}})\\}$ ] for all @xmath107^s$ ] . in general , the sets @xmath108 are not boxes anymore and therefore one wants to have point sets @xmath109^s$ ] which have small discrepancy with respect to the test sets @xmath13 rather than boxes .",
    "such a problem also comes up for instance in lecuyer , lecot and tuffin  @xcite and their arrayrqmc method . in some cases",
    ", one can do stratified sampling , that is , divide the cube into subcubes with side length @xmath110 and randomly place a point in each box .",
    "then one can show a convergence rate of order @xmath111 .",
    "however , for instance , in lecuyer , lecot and tuffin  @xcite better rates of convergence where observed when using low - discrepancy point sets . in kuo , dunsmuir , sloan , wand and womersley",
    "@xcite it was observed that the choice of transformation @xmath112 influences the rate of convergence , but it is a priori not clear what choice of @xmath112 yields the best results . for these types of applications it would be interesting to have point sets which achieve good convergence rates for various types of test sets .    in this context , we mention one construction of explicit point sets in dimension @xmath59 which considers more general test sets .",
    "namely the construction by bilyk , ma , pipher , spencer  @xcite where discrepancy with respect to certain rotated boxes is considered .",
    "in statistical sampling one often wants to sample from a target distribution .",
    "the standard procedure to obtain samples from a given distribution is to invert the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) , which can be used to map points from the cube @xmath4^s$ ] to the required domain .",
    "however , this is often not possible ( or difficult ) , in which case one has to resort to other methods . as an example , consider the unnormalized density function @xmath113 for @xmath114 $ ] .",
    "the normalization constant is @xmath115 .",
    "the cdf is given by @xmath116 in order to be able to sample directly from the density @xmath117 , one would have to invert @xmath118 .",
    "since this is not feasible , one has to resort to other methods like the acceptance - rejection algorithm .",
    "the acceptance rejection sampler proceeds in the following way .",

    "on the other hand , for every point set @xmath131 , there is a concave function @xmath98 such that @xmath146 .",
    "thus , in general , the upper bound can not be significantly improved without using further assumptions .",
    "smoothness of @xmath98 would be an assumption where one would hope to be able to get better results .",
    "let @xmath147 be a state space and @xmath148^s \\to g$ ] .",

    "@xcite the authors studied markov chains and conditions under which the markov chain consistently samples a target distribution @xmath98 , that is , for every continuous function defined on @xmath102 we have @xmath152 in chen , d. and owen  @xcite it was shown that if the random numbers @xmath153 are completely uniformly distributed ( and some further assumptions on the update function are satisfied ) , then holds .",
    "complete uniform distribution is a condition on a sequence of numbers @xmath154 $ ] which ensures statistical independence of successive terms in some sense .",
