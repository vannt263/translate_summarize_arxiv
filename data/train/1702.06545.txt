    "water masers arising from thin disks around massive black holes provide high brightness temperature non - thermal dynamical tracers of gas in keplerian orbits .",
    "as such , water maser disks viewed edge - on provide tracers of the keplerian potential and enable measurement of the black hole mass , provided a distance is known in order to translate the apparent angular disk size into a physical size ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "maser accelerations and proper motions can also be observed , and because the circular velocity is known from doppler shifts , the geometric distance to the black holes ( and host galaxies ) can be determined ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "geometric distances obtained from water masers provide a crucial independent measurement of the hubble constant and can be used to calibrate other distance indicators such as the period - luminosity relation of cepheids @xcite .",
    "these measurements require maser disks that are viewed within a few degrees of edge - on : otherwise , maser beaming directs emission away from the observer because masers propagate along velocity - coherent paths through the disk .",
    "for thin disks , this propagation occurs along the radial path along the line of sight toward the black hole and along the disk tangent points . for warped disks , such as that found in ngc 4258 ,",
    "the picture is more nuanced because a warped disk provides numerous sightlines and inclinations that intersect velocity - coherent parts of the disk @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , inclined maser disks are generally not seen in water maser surveys . or are they ?",
    "it seems likely that inclined water maser disks have already been detected by single dish surveys , but they have been discarded because they show no high velocity lines that have canonically been used to identify maser disks . in this paper , we propose a mechanism to produce detectable maser emission from inclined disks that may also be used to obtain black hole masses ( section [ sec : thought ] ) , we present a method to detect inclined maser disks based on extant surveys ( section [ sec : candidates ] ) , we present karl g. jansky very large array ( vla ) observations of candidate inclined disks ( sections [ sec : obs ] and [ sec : results ] ) , and we provide a list of inclined disk candidates for further study ( sections [ sec : analysis ] and [ sec : discussion ] ) . in",
    "what follows , we assume a flat cosmology with parameters @xmath3  km  s@xmath4  mpc@xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , and we calculate distances from redshifts in the cmb rest frame .",
    "consider a typical 22 ghz water maser thin disk in keplerian orbit around a massive black hole .",
    "this thin disk shows systemic velocity masers at the center of the observed disk , along a radial amplification path , and it shows high - velocity red- and blue - shifted masers at the tangent points of the disk , along azimuthal paths , amplifying spontaneous emission and background host galaxy continuum ( figure [ fig : schematic ] , left ) . if a thin disk is inclined by more than a few degrees , the masers are no longer beamed toward the observer and the disk would not be detected .",
    "the known water maser disks show an inclination typically within @xmath75@xmath8 of edge - on ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that an order of magnitude additional maser disks exist , and they are simply beamed in directions we can not observe . note that the famous water maser disk in ngc 4258 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is atypical , with a disk inclination of 72@xmath8 , but the disk warp provides sightlines that are nearly edge - on , and this is where the masers are seen @xcite .    for the following discussion we will use fiducial parameters similar to those of many of the known maser disks @xcite .",
    "we assume a distance of 10 mpc , a black hole mass of @xmath9 ( and therefore a schwarzschild radius of @xmath10pc ) , and a circular rotation speed of 1000 km s@xmath4 in the maser - active part of the disk located 0.5 pc from the black hole and spanning 0.2 pc .",
    "we assume a disk thickness equal to that of ngc 4258 : @xmath11 cm or 0.18 mpc ( 1@xmath12 ; * ? ? ?",
    "consider how this system appears to an observer at the location of the black hole : the disk describes a plane in the sky .",
    "water masers reaching this observer must be purely radial ( propagating inward ) but will have a coherent amplification path in all radial directions ( figure [ fig : schematic ] , center ) .",
    "all keplerian doppler shifts will be across the line of sight , so all maser emission reaching this location will have zero velocity in this reference frame ( ignoring the transverse doppler shift , which is negligible at @xmath72 km  s@xmath4 ) .",
    "the black hole - frame observer will thus see a ring of maser light or maser spots with low velocity spread .",
    "the maser - active part of the disk would subtend @xmath72.5 arcminutes ( 1@xmath12 ) .",
    "the expected maser opening angle would be similar , @xmath73 arcminutes , assuming a maser path - to - size ratio of @xmath70.2 pc/0.2 mpc @xmath13 , implying maser light spanning @xmath7500 @xmath14 at the black hole .",
    "the black hole kerr metric would thus be bathed in maser light with a continuous distribution of impact parameters , implying gravitational deflection of maser light into nearly all angles ( the deflection at 100 @xmath14 is 1.1@xmath8 and grows inversely with impact parameter @xmath15 as @xmath16 ; @xcite ) .",
    "one would therefore expect incoming maser light to be scattered into many angles , representing a gravitational lensing de - focusing of a given incoming beam .",
    "but portions of multiple maser beams from around the disk may be deflected into a given direction , making the net flux as a function of angular direction uncertain and in need of numerical modeling .",
    "ngc 4258 has a warped disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which means that the in - going radial masers can be misaligned and thus be beamed above or below the dynamical center of the disk , and that the continuous distribution of disk inclination angles will fully populate the black hole metric volume with beams from multiple angles , further enhancing the sampling of impact parameters and deflection angles .",
    "if warped disks are common , then maser disks with high velocity lines will be detected more often than one would assume based on random inclination alone ( in other words , parts of many disks will have inclinations appropriate for detectable maser amplification ) , and the black hole will be illuminated by in - going masers from above and below the nominal disk plane , producing a range of incoming maser impact parameters and angles with respect to the disk , thereby enhancing the gravitational deflection probability toward any given observer . regardless of whether disks are warped or not , maser light will be scattered away from the maser disk plane , making inclined disks potentially detectable , but likely faint compared to edge - on disk masers .",
    "masers amplify seed photons , and these seed photons can be the portion of a radio continuum that matches the maser line frequency , appropriately doppler - shifted , or they can be spontaneously emitted maser line photons . in known maser disks ,",
    "the systemic radial masers typically amplify the agn radio continuum , and the high - velocity tangential masers amplify spontaneous emission or possibly radio continuum from the host galaxy itself .",
    "in - going radial masers do not have access to agn seed photons and must amplify either continuum from the host galaxy or inward - directed spontaneous emission from the outer parts of the disk . in either case , it is reasonable to expect in - going masers to be weaker than the out - going systemic masers from edge - on disks .",
    "it is unclear how the amplification of in - going masers would compare to the amplification of the high - velocity masers in edge - on disks because the tangential amplification pathway may or may not have a physically longer or higher column density velocity - coherent path for amplification .",
    "if one were to observe a water maser disk from a direction other than edge - on , would water maser emission be seen ?",
    "the thought experiment described here suggests that it would , and the inclination of the disk with respect to the observer would select the deflection angle ( or equivalently the impact parameter ) of the observed maser light . for example , deflection by 10@xmath8 would allow observation of masers from the back side of a disk with an inclination of 80@xmath8 , requiring an impact parameter of 12 @xmath14 .",
    "other parts of the disk could be viewed if light reaches smaller impact parameters .",
    "if , as expected , there is a continuous range of impact parameters , then a continuous distribution of maser light from an extended portion of the disk will contribute to a spectrally narrow maser line complex seen by the observer at nearly any inclination ( but perhaps with higher likelihood and intensity at higher inclinations ) .",
    "the observational signatures of an inclined water maser disk would be : + 1 . a narrow line or line complex + 2 . at the systemic velocity + 3 . at the apparent black hole location . + the black hole location",
    "would be indicated by the radio continuum core , ideally observed at the same frequency as the water maser .",
    "the observational signatures of an inclined water maser disk , however , may also arise from other mechanisms .",
    "water masers can be produced in radio jet - molecular cloud interactions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in star - forming regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and in outflows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* but note that some objects in the latter survey may be candidates for inclined disk masers ) .",
    "these are likely to be the main contaminant among an inclined disk survey sample .",
    "vlbi identification of the maser with an agn via spatial coincidence with the core radio continuum  identified by the spectral index  can resolve the ambiguity ( section [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "in contrast to edge - on disk systemic masers , it is unclear whether inclined disk maser lines will show proper motion or acceleration .",
    "this may depend on the clumpiness of maser - emitting regions , on the maser beam sizes , on the physical extent of the disk that is sampled by the observed line , and on the deflection angle to the observer .",
    "one might expect lensed masers to show little or no time variability , but the substructure seen in known water maser disks and the natural variability of water masers suggests that this may be a bad assumption .",
    "many extragalactic water masers detected in previous surveys meet some or all of the above observational criteria : inclined water maser disks may have already been detected ! in most cases , when a single systemic velocity line is detected in water maser surveys , there is no interferometric follow - up because distance or black hole mass measurements ( traditionally ) require edge - on disks , the signature of which are the high velocity lines emitted from the tangent points of the disk .",
    "high resolution observations may also be frustrated by weak or variable water masers .    in section [ sec : obs ] we present interferometric mapping of a sample of narrow - line systemic velocity water masers that appear to be inclined disk maser candidates .",
    "if observations show that the masers remain unresolved and are centered at the location of the central massive black hole ( as identified by simultaneous radio continuum observations at 20 ghz ) , then they remain candidates and should be mapped with vlbi .",
    "the einstein radius of a strong gravitational lens is @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are the angular diameter distances to the lens , to the source , and between the lens and the source , respectively , and @xmath21 for the black hole - maser disk configuration ( after * ? ? ?",
    "for the fiducial parameters listed above ( @xmath22 @xmath23pc , @xmath24 pc , and @xmath25 mpc ) , @xmath26 mas .",
    "since the angular resolution ( hpbw ) of the very long baseline array ( vlba ) is 0.3 milliarcseconds at 22.2 ghz ( which should be compared to twice the einstein radius ) , the einstein radius for the fiducial maser disk and black hole would require space - based vlbi to resolve .",
    "on the other hand , terrestrial vlbi could resolve a water maser einstein ring for a more massive black hole with a physically larger maser disk : for @xmath27 @xmath23pc ( @xmath28 ) , @xmath29 pc , and @xmath25 mpc , @xmath30 mas .",
    "unfortunately , water maser disks have yet to be identified orbiting @xmath31 black holes , but it is unclear whether is this a selection effect or a consequence of physics @xcite .",
    "the most massive black hole measured using a water maser disk to date is in ngc 1194 with @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "were an einstein ring observable from a back side in - going maser in an edge - on disk or from an in - going maser from an edge - on portion of an inclined warped disk , then one can infer a black hole mass from the angular size of the ring .",
    "one does need independent measurements of the luminosity distance to the black hole ( @xmath18 ) and the size of the maser - emitting disk ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "@xmath18 can be obtained from an assumed cosmology and the cosmological redshift , but @xmath20 may be more difficult to measure .",
    "the precision of black hole masses obtained from this method may be limited by our ability to measure , model , or estimate the radius of the maser - emitting part of the disk .",
    "einstein rings require linear alignment between the source , the lens , and the observer , which is not germane to the inclined maser disk geometry ( for unwarped disks ) . instead",
    ", one would navely expect to see multiple images of the same maser , which can also be related to the black hole mass .",
    "this expectation , which is correct for isotropic emitters , is probably incorrect for masers .",
    "an important difference between maser emission and the standard treatment of gravitational lensing is maser beaming : while there may be sightlines in a gravitational lens geometry that land on the emitter , emission may not be seen if light is not beamed along that sightline . for a general pointlike isotropic light source offset from the lens by angle @xmath33",
    ", there are two solutions to the lens equation : @xmath34 @xmath35 represents the angle between the lens and the source image appearing outside @xmath36 , and @xmath37 represents the angle of the image appearing inside @xmath36 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation 24 , figures 5 and 7 ) . for an inclined maser disk configuration ,",
    "no emission is directed significantly out of the disk plane , so no maser emission would be seen in the @xmath35 direction . on the other hand , @xmath37 may be small enough that this sightline is included in the maser beam passing very close to the central black hole . in this case , the source - observer deflection angle @xmath38 nearly matches the complement of the disk inclination : @xmath39 ( figure [ fig : schematic ] , right ) .",
    "in contrast to canonical lensing , we expect that the maser beaming will produce only one maser spot image , where light is deflected in the manner shown schematically in figure [ fig : schematic ] ( right ) .",
    "this maser image will lie inside the einstein radius . for",
    "isotropic extended emitters , this image would also be demagnified , but masers are not isotropic emitters and can be exceptionally compact ( equivalently , they demonstrate high brightness temperatures ) .",
    "the degree of demagnification is therefore unclear and requires numerical ray - tracing to assess .    for the fiducial parameters above , and assuming an inclination of @xmath40 , @xmath41 mas , @xmath42 mas , and therefore @xmath43 @xmath23as , which is equivalent to 11 @xmath14 .",
    "the maser beam spans this distance from the black hole , so the maser emission can be lensed toward the observer in this case . for the @xmath31 black hole with a larger maser disk described above , @xmath44 mas , @xmath45 mas , and therefore @xmath46 @xmath23as , which is again equivalent to 11 @xmath14 ( the impact parameter determines the deflection angle , which is determined by the inclination ) .",
    "one would therefore expect lensed masers from inclined disks to be faint and appear to arise from the black hole location ( @xmath47 mas ) .",
    "this treatment assumes a single pointlike maser rather than an extended continuous disk of masers or a set of distributed maser spots . in this more realistic scenario ,",
    "numerical ray - tracing is required to connect the observable lensed maser image to the black hole mass and maser disk configuration .",
    "lensed masers from inclined disks may appear to be pointlike or they may describe arcs .",
    "in - going masers from the far side of an edge - on disk or in - going masers from an inclined but warped disk may produce einstein rings .",
    "single - epoch vlbi maps can therefore provide black hole masses , but space - based vlbi may be required for the typical @xmath48 black hole associated with water maser disks .",
    "the mass measurement precision will be limited by uncertainty about the maser disk size rather than by the distance to the object ( the maser will provide the systemic redshift , which can be converted into a distance , and the distance uncertainty will be dominated by peculiar velocity departures from the hubble flow ) .      if there are in - going radial water masers in maser disks ( and there is no compelling reason to think otherwise ) , then there should be systemic water masers seen in edge - on disks from the back side of the disk , both lensed and unlensed by the black hole .",
    "are such masers in extant data ?",
    "if there are also front - side systemic masers in an edge - on disk , then they will be orders of magnitude brighter than back - side masers , even in the presence of strong lensing , simply due to amplification considerations .",
    "the front - side masers can amplify agn radio continuum , whereas the back - side masers will either be driven by stimulated emission ( but with an amplification pathway equal to the front - side masers ) or by host galaxy continuum , which is substantially weaker than agn continuum at 22 ghz in many cases . the back - side maser contribution",
    "may therefore be confused by the front - side emission , particularly since both types of maser emission will occur at the systemic velocity .    in rare cases , a back - side maser might be distinguishable from the front - side emission either by a position or a velocity offset ( there is some spread to systemic velocity masers , e.g. @xcite )",
    ". the observational signature of a back - side maser would be an acceleration in the opposite sense of the front - side systemic maser acceleration ( i.e. , negative acceleration under the convention that positive velocities are redshifted ) .",
    "this is not seen in published systemic maser acceleration measurements ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but such a signal could be lost amid the brighter and numerous front - side masers .    if a back - side maser is lensed into an arc or einstein ring by the central black hole , then it might be extended in vlbi maps .",
    "resolved systemic maser emission would therefore be an additional observable signature of back - side masers .",
    "if inclined water maser disks can be detected via gravitational lensing or deflection of in - going masers by massive black holes , then they have likely already been detected in surveys for maser disks .",
    "but they were rejected as disk candidates because they lacked high - velocity emission .",
    "inclined maser disks will appear to have maser emission only at the systemic velocity of the galaxy or agn .",
    "we therefore use extant water maser surveys to select inclined disk candidates .    using extant water maser surveys , most of which favor seyfert 2 agn , we examined single - dish spectra compiled by the megamaser cosmology projecthttps://safe.nrao.edu / wiki / bin / view / main / privatewatermaserlist ] to select objects showing a narrow systemic velocity maser or maser complex .",
    "we also imposed a 30 mjy line flux limit and excluded objects south of @xmath49 declination .",
    "this process identified 16 inclined maser disk candidates ( table [ tab : obs ] ) , and most candidates ( 14 ) have only been observed with a single dish .",
    "those that do have interferometric maps are ngc 3556 , which was mapped using the vla in cnb and dna configurations @xcite with no 22 ghz continuum detected ( 1@xmath12 rms noise of @xmath70.5 mjy beam@xmath4 ) , and ngc 3735,which was mapped using a - array @xcite , but no 22 ghz continuum was detected .",
    "since the inclinations of known maser disks are nearly edge - on , the number of inclined maser disks must be large , roughly an order of magnitude larger than the number of detected maser disks .",
    "however , the gravitational lensing or deflection of detectable in - going radial masers adds substantial uncertainty to the detection expectations . we do not know how common observable lensed inclined maser disks are in the universe because we do not know the opening angle of the masers , the size of the maser spots with respect to the black hole s schwarzschild radius , the brightness of in - going masers , which will depend on the 22 ghz seed photons from the host galaxy , or the degree of gravitational lensing demagnification .",
    "we observed the 22.23508 ghz @xmath50 ortho water maser line and 20 ghz radio continuum toward 16 candidate inclined maser disks ( see section [ sec : candidates ] and table [ tab : obs ] ) using the vla in a configuration ( the highest angular resolution configuration ) .",
    "observations of program 15a-297 spanned june 19 2015 through september 26 2015 in five sessions .",
    "the fifth session occurred during the a - array to d - array reconfiguration .",
    "each session included visits to flux and bandpass calibrators , and observations of each target object were interleaved with nearby complex gain calibrators with a @xmath74 minute switching cadence .",
    "spectral line and continuum observations were simultaneous .",
    "the spectral line observations were centered on the redshift of the host galaxy , had 1.11.9 km s@xmath4 spectral resolution , used 1536 channels to span 128 mhz ( 17002900 km s@xmath4 ) , and used dual circular polarization and 8-bit sampling .",

    "<S> we describe a method to identify inclined water maser disks orbiting massive black holes and to potentially use them to measure black hole masses . due to the geometry of maser amplification pathways , </S>",
    "<S> the minority of water maser disks are observable : only those viewed nearly edge - on have been identified , suggesting that an order of magnitude additional maser disks exist . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that inward - propagating masers will be gravitationally deflected by the central black hole , thereby scattering water maser emission out of the disk plane and enabling detection </S>",
    "<S> . the signature of an inclined water maser disk would be narrow masers near the systemic velocity that appear to emit from the black hole position , as identified by the radio continuum core . to explore this possibility , </S>",
    "<S> we present high resolution ( 0.070.17 ) very large array line and continuum observations of 13 galaxies with narrow water maser emission and show that three are good inclined disk candidates ( five remain ambiguous ) . in the best case , for cgcg 120@xmath0039 , we show that the maser and continuum emission are coincident to within @xmath1 pc ( @xmath2 milliarcsec ) . </S>",
    "<S> subsequent very long baseline interferometric maps can confirm candidate inclined disks and have the potential to show maser rings or arcs that provide a direct measurement of black hole mass , although the mass precision will rely on knowledge of the size of the maser disk . </S>"
