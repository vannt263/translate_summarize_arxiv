    "a very important yet difficult issue of electronic device physics is to be able to predict fluctuations in quantum transport properties due to atomic disorder@xcite . in existing and emerging field - effect transistors with a channel length of @xmath0 or so",
    ", a serious source of property unpredictability is the random dopant fluctuation ( rdf ) .",
    "rdf comes from the particular microscopic arrangement of the small number of dopant atoms inside the device channel .",
    "experimentally it is extremely difficult  if not absolutely impossible , to control the precise location of each dopant atom , therefore transport properties vary from one device to another .",
    "it was even pointed out that nanowire transistors can suffer from rdf in the source / drain extension region even if the channel is dopant free@xcite .",
    "the device - to - device variability is in fact a general phenomenon for device structures in the nano - meter scale which compromises device performance and circuit functionality . from the theoretical point of view , incorporating disorder and randomness in nano - electronics modeling is of great importance @xcite . in particular , one is interested in predicting not only the average value of the transport property ( e.g. conductance ) but also the variance of it .",
    "the device - to - device variability has so far been investigated by statistical analysis of large number of simulations .",
    "for instance reil _",
    "et al _ carried out classical drift - diffusion simulations for an ensemble of @xmath1 dopant configurations under the combined influence of rdf and line edge roughness@xcite .",
    "et al _ did effective - mass nonequilibrium green s function ( negf ) simulations of an ensemble of @xmath2 dopant configurations to analyze statistical variability of quantum transport in gate - all - around silicon nanowires@xcite .",
    "the contrast of the size of the statistical ensemble clearly shows the difficulty of quantum simulations .",
    "the difficulty in brute force computation becomes much more severe in full self - consistent atomistic modeling ( as opposed to effective - mass modeling ) such as the negf based density functional theory ( dft)@xcite . there is an urgent need to develop viable theoretical methods that does not rely on brute force computation for predicting the device - to - device variability .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to present such a formalism .",
    "we shall report a new theoretical approach to directly calculate statistical variations of quantum transport due to rdf without individually computing each and every impurity configuration by brute force .",
    "our theory is composed of two formalisms : one is general but more complicated and the other is specialized but much simpler .",
    "the two formalisms are based on the green s function technique and the multiple scattering theory .",
    "the first formalism builds on coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) and can be applied to a wide range of impurity concentrations .",
    "the second formalism builds on the low concentration approximation ( lca ) and is extremely useful for situations involving low impurity concentration which is often the case for realistic semiconductor devices .",
    "our theory and implementation have been checked by both analytical and numerical verification .        the basic physical model of a two - probe quantum coherent nanoelectronic device is schematically shown in any one of the sub - figures of fig.twoprobe system , which consists of a central channel region sandwiched by the left and right semi - infinite electrodes@xcite .",
    "the electrodes extend to reservoirs at @xmath3 where bias voltages are applied and electric current measured .",
    "we assume that the rdf occurs in the channel region of the system and each sub - figure in fig.[twoprobe system ] represents one dopant configuration .",
    "clearly , due to different locations of the dopant atoms , every device exhibits slightly different transport behavior leading to the device - to - device variability .",
    "the transport current flowing through the device can be expressed@xcite in terms of the transmission coefficient @xmath4 ( hereafter atomic units are assumed , @xmath5 ) , @xmath6 \\ ,   \\label{eq1}\\]]where @xmath7 is the electron energy , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the fermi functions of the left / right electrodes . without rdf ,",
    "the electric current @xmath10 is a definite number for a given bias voltage . in the presence of rdf , @xmath10 depends on the particular impurity configuration thus varies from one configuration to another .",
    "by calculating a large ensemble of configurations one can determine an average current and its associated variance @xmath11 .",
    "for our device model where rdf occurs inside the channel region , @xmath11 is obtained in term of transmission fluctuation , @xmath12 , as follows@xmath13 \\ .",
    "\\label{dt}\\]]by definition , the transmission fluctuation @xmath14 is obtained from the rdf ensemble average , @xmath15where @xmath16 refers to averaging over the disorder configurations .",
    "notice that the transmission coefficient @xmath4 can be expressed in terms of green s functions .",
    "as a result the calculation of @xmath17 involves evaluating a 2-green s function correlator @xmath18 .",
    "the calculation of transmission fluctuation @xmath19 which needs the quantity @xmath20 involve a 4-green s function correlator @xmath21 .    in the literature , a well known technique called coherent potential approximation ( cpa)@xcite is available to evaluate disorder average of a single green s function @xmath22 .",
    "the cpa technique was generalized @xcite to evaluate 2-green s function correlators @xmath23 and 3-green s function correlators @xmath24 ( albeit in other contexts ) .",
    "more recently , the generalized cpa technique for calculating the 2-green s function correlator has been applied to study transmission@xcite and nonequilibrium quantum transport@xcite in disordered systems .",
    "this work will address how to evaluate 4-green s function correlator and apply the technique to study device variability .    in a very recent manuscript@xcite , zhuang and",
    "wang carried out an analysis of conductance fluctuation and shot noise in graphene by using a direct expansion approach .",
    "to some extent , their approach is complementary to the methods presented in this work with respect to accuracy and efficiency .",
    "finally , there are large bodies of literature in mesoscopic physics to analyze such issues as the universal conductance fluctuation in bulk systems using the kubo formula and @xmath25-like short range impurity potentials@xcite . in contrast",
    ", the goal of this work is to formulate a theoretical approach for calculating the transmission fluctuation of two - probe systems where the disorder scattering is due to impurity atoms as opposed to @xmath25-like models .",

    "to simulate disorder sites in the central region , the on - site energies are assumed to be discrete random variables .",
    "namely , on a disorder site-@xmath26 the on - site energy @xmath27 can take the value @xmath28 with the probability @xmath29 where @xmath30 indicating the possible atomic species on that site and the normalization requires @xmath31 .    for a given disorder configuration @xmath32",
    ", the transmission coefficient @xmath33 can be derived in terms of the green s functions of the central region@xcite @xmath34 ,   \\label{trans1}\\]]where @xmath35 are the retarded and advanced green s functions , @xmath36 are the linewidth functions of the left and right electrodes .",

    "the advanced green s function and self - energy are hermitian conjugates of their retarded counterparts,@xmath45    to determine @xmath14 by eq.([definition1 ] ) , one needs to calculate the configuration averaged quantities @xmath20 and @xmath46 . while vertex correction technique have been applied successfully to calculate @xmath46 , the quantity @xmath20 turns out to be extremely difficult to calculate and the goal of this work is to derive a necessary formulation for it .",
    "since our approach is based on the t - matrix formalism , in the rest of this section , we briefly review the well known t - matrix formalism following ref ..    recall that @xmath47 is the hamiltonian of central region which contains some disorder sites ( see fig.[twoprobe system ] ) . divide @xmath47 into two parts , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is",
    "the definite part of the hamiltonian and @xmath49 is the random disorder potential , @xmath51 in which @xmath52 is the random potential of disorder site-@xmath26 .",

    "@xmath56 is related to the on - site energy @xmath57 by @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is a site - dependent arbitrary constant .",
    "due to different choices of @xmath60 , the partition of @xmath47 into @xmath50 and @xmath49 is not unique .",
    "we shall exploit this freedom and adopt different partitions for cpa and lca ( see next two sections ) .    with the partition eqs.([h0],[vi1 ] ) , the retarded green s function of eq.([gr1 ] ) can be expressed in terms of the unperturbed green s function @xmath61 and the t - matrix @xmath62 @xmath63where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are defined as@xmath64 ^{-1 } ,   \\label{gr0}\\ ] ] @xmath65    the t - matrix @xmath62 can be further expanded in terms of scattering amplitude @xmath66 , @xmath67where @xmath66 represents multiple disorder scattering on the site-@xmath68@xmath69similar to @xmath52 , @xmath66 is also a nearly all - zero matrix except for its @xmath26-th diagonal element @xmath70 , \\]]where @xmath71 is a random variable which can take the value @xmath72 with the probability @xmath29 .",

    "it is required that adjacent @xmath66 lines must have different site indices .",
    "clearly , a similar expansion can be carried out for the advanced green s function @xmath78 .",
    "the t - matrix expansion in eq.([t - matrix eq03 ] ) is rigorous . by inserting eq.([t - matrix eq03 ] ) and",
    "its advanced counterpart into eq.([trans1 ] ) and its square , after averaging over disorder configurations , @xmath79 and @xmath80 can be derived as a summation of products composed of @xmath29 , @xmath75 and @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 . in principle , one can calculate @xmath17 and @xmath20 by summing up these terms order by order , which is accurate but impractical for realistic device simulations .",
    "alternatively , diagrammatic techniques will be developed in the following sections to evaluate the summation approximately .",
    "in this section we present the formalism for calculating transmission fluctuation @xmath14 based on the cpa diagrammatic technique .",
    "the main idea is to expand @xmath46 and @xmath20 into a series of scattering terms each of which can be mapped into a diagram . at the cpa level , a subset of these diagrams ( the non - crossing diagrams ) can be collected and summed up . the diagrammatic technique was originally developed in ref . to calculate transport coefficients involving 3-green s function correlators . here",
    ", this technique is improved and generalized to calculate @xmath14 involving 4-green s function correlators .      as shown in eq.([trans1 ] ) , transmission coefficient @xmath4 is a trace of matrix product , and hence @xmath86 is a product of two traces which is inconvenient to apply the diagrammatic technique . to proceed , we first rewrite @xmath86 into a proper matrix product form . using the @xmath41-decomposition technique introduced in ref .",
    ", the line - width function of the right electrode , @xmath83 , can be decomposed as @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the @xmath89-th normalized eigenvector of the @xmath83 matrix@xcite . consequently , using eq.([trans1 ] ) @xmath86 can be rewritten in the following @xmath41-decomposition form : @xmath90where @xmath91 is defined as @xmath92 .",
    "so the calculations of @xmath46 and @xmath20 are reduced to the green s function correlators tr@xmath93 and tr@xmath94 where @xmath95 is a definite quantity which is referred to as the vertex of the correlator . notice that @xmath76 and @xmath78 always appear alternatively in @xmath46 and @xmath20 , as such we shall omit the superscripts @xmath96 in the cpa diagrammatic expansion without causing any ambiguity .      eq.([gamma decomposition ] ) indicates that we need to calculate various green s function correlators such as : @xmath97to proceed we insert eq.([t - matrix eq03 ] ) into @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) to obtain a series expansion . in analogous to eq.([t - matrix eq03 ] ) and fig.[t - expansion ] , each term in the @xmath98 series expansion can be represented by a diagram : the thick line represents the full green s function @xmath100 ; the thin line represents the unperturbed green s function @xmath101 ; the blue dot represents the vertex @xmath102 ; the dotted line with a red dot represents the impurity scattering amplitude @xmath103 .",
    "the trace operation is represented by a closed circle composed of @xmath104-lines and @xmath105-vertexes .",
    "if some impurity indices are identical in the disorder average , the corresponding impurity lines need to be contracted with each other .",
    "the major difference between the diagrams in this section and fig.t - expansion is that the former diagrams represent terms after disorder average while the latter represents terms before disorder average .",
    "thus the lengthy series expansion of @xmath98 is nicely organized into a diagrammatic fashion .",
    "one can sum up the diagrams in a perturbative manner up to some finite order as done in ref .. alternatively , by selecting a subset of the diagrams , one can evaluate the diagrammatic summation to _ infinite _ order . in particular , the subset is called cpa diagrams selected by the following two rules . (",
    "i ) an impurity line on one @xmath104-line must contract with impurity line(s ) of other @xmath106-line(s ) , and no dangling impurity line is allowed .",
    "the reason is that in cpa@xcite the partition of @xmath50 and @xmath49 is chosen such that @xmath107and hence diagrams with dangling impurity lines vanish ( see appendix - cpa condition section for details ) .",
    "( ii ) contracted impurity lines do not cross each other .",
    "namely , only the non - crossing diagrams are taken into account in the cpa diagrammatic summation . in the following subsections ,",
    "cpa diagrams of @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 will be analyzed in detail .          by inserting eq.([t - matrix eq03 ] ) into eq.([i2 ] ) and applying cpa diagram rules , the @xmath108 diagrams are obtained in fig.[i2diagram ] . in the first row of fig.[i2diagram ] , the diagram equation corresponds to the following algebraic equation :    @xmath112    the diagram representation in fig.[i2diagram ] significantly simplifies the algebraic expression of eq.([i2expression ] ) .    in the second and third rows of fig.[i2diagram ] , the diagrams of @xmath108 is further simplified by using a bundled line ( second row ) and a dressed vertex ( third row ) . the bundled line @xmath113 ( green thick line ) is a collection of ladder diagrams .",

    "it is clear that the using of the dressed vertex and dressed double vertex greatly reduces the number of cpa diagrams .",
    "how do we know that all the cpa diagrams have been included in the diagrammatic summation ?",
    "there are some ward s type identities in green s functions which are helpful to verify the completeness of the cpa diagrams .",
    "the identities reduce a product of green s functions to products of fewer green s functions . by applying disorder",
    "average to both sides of the identity , the identity must remain valid if the average is done rigorously . this way the higher level correlators ( e.g. 4-green s function correlators ) are related to lower level correlators ( e.g. , 2-green s function correlators ) .",
    "the amazing feature of cpa is that the identity still holds even if approximations are made on both sides of the identity . in this sense",
    ", cpa is a consistent approximation for the green s function correlators .",
    "these identities can thus be used to verify theoretical derivations as well as numerical implementations . missing a single diagram",

    "nevertheless , in semiconductor devices ( e.g. transistors ) the doping concentration is always very low . even for heavily doped si at a doping level @xmath131 ,",
    "the impurity concentration amounts to @xmath132 which is a small parameter .",

    "in contrast , the lca formalism does not require  @xmath194-decomposition and can be applied directly to calculate @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath41-decomposition leads to double summation and double @xmath161-integral ( see eq.([decomp2 ] ) ) over conducting channels of the electrode and significantly increase the computational cost .",
    "( iii ) cpa is far more complicated to implement than lca , because the former needs to solve the cpa equations as well as several vertex correction equations iteratively as discussed at the end of section iii - g .",
    "in contrast , lca provides an explicit formula , eq.([lca ] ) , to calculate the transmission fluctuation directly .",
    "( iv ) to reduce the computational cost in modeling nanoelectronic devices , it is often desirable to partition a two - probe system into many slices along the transport direction and apply a numerical trick  the principal layer algorithm , in the green s function s calculation@xcite .",
    "this very useful algorithm can be easily integrated into the lca formulism but it is incompatible with the cpa diagrams . in short , the cpa diagrammatic formalism is much more complicated and costly than lca to calculate @xmath14 due to the reasons listed in ( ii ) to ( iv ) , although cpa is more accurate and applicable to a wider concentration range .",
    "it is straightforward to generalize both cpa and lca formalisms to the atomic model of nanoelectronic devices .",

    "( 3 ) large transmission fluctuation occurs at energies where the transmission channel number changes drastically .",
    "it implies that current fluctuation can be suppressed if the bias voltage window is tuned to locate in an energy plateau with slow varying conducting channel number .",

    "the cpa solution is very expensive due to double summation and double @xmath161-integral in the @xmath41-decomposition eq.([decomp2 ] ) .",
    "since the lca solution of finite cross section has been checked in the previous subsection , the lca solution of periodic cross section will be checked against it by using a large finite cross section containing @xmath235 rows .     in the clean limit .",

    "the system has a periodic cross section and the transport is perpendicular to the cu ( 111 ) direction . in the atomic model , the left and right semi - infinite cu electrodes",

    "is presented in fig.[application ab ] .     random vacancy defects .",
    "( a ) transmission fluctuation @xmath14 on top of transmission @xmath4 versus energy @xmath7 .",

    "( b ) total and angular momentum resolved density of states versus @xmath7 . , width=302,height=377 ]    the transmission fluctuation exhibits a strong energy dependence .",
    "this is quite interesting since it means the conductance fluctuation can be effectively suppressed by shifting the fermi energy . in the vicinity of @xmath245 , @xmath14 is rather small although @xmath4 changes rapidly , which seems to be different than the observations in the tight - binding examples .",
    "further analysis shows that the density of states is dominated by @xmath246-wave in the energy regime around @xmath245 and is a mixtures of @xmath247-wave , @xmath248-wave and @xmath246-wave well above this energy .",
    "transmission fluctuation is enhanced due to disorder scattering among different angular momentum states .",
    "this indicates that the transmission fluctuation is not only affected by the number of the conducting channels ( as in the tb models ) but also by the angular momentum states of the channels when realistic atomic models are considered .",
    "in this work , we have developed two theoretical formalisms based on cpa and lca to predict device - to - device variability induced by random dopant fluctuation .",
    "the advantage of our theory is that statistical averaging due to rdf is carried out analytically to avoid large number of dopant configuration sampling in device simulations .",
    "the numerical accuracy of cpa and lca formalism depends on the doping concentration @xmath130 . for @xmath229 ,",
    "both cpa and lca solutions are satisfactory , as shown in the comparison to the exact solution of 1d tb model . for @xmath249 ,",
    "both cpa and lca become numerically less accurate even though they still capture a rough trend of the transmission fluctuation as demonstrated by the 1d tb model . in lca",
    "we have neglected high order terms in the @xmath130-expansion , while in cpa we have neglected the crossing diagrams .",
    "these approximations limit the accuracy of the theory to the relatively low impurity concentrations .",
    "we note that for essentially all the practical semiconductor devices , the dopant concentration is well within the applicability range of our formalisms . in numerical modeling ,",
    "the lca is easier and perhaps more practical for realistic nanoelectronic devices because an explicit formula eq.([lca ] ) is available and the computational cost is much cheaper than that of cpa . we have also implemented the lca theory into the first principles device modeling package nanodsim so that first principles analysis of device - to - device variability can now be carried out without any phenomenological parameters .",
    "preliminary studies indicate that transmission fluctuation is most pronounced in the energy regime where the number of the conducting channels varies rapidly .",
    "in addition , angular momentum states of the conducting channels also play an essential role .",
    "since the fluctuation strongly depends on the electron energy , our numerical simulation suggests that the rdf induced transmission fluctuation could be suppressed by engineering the bias voltage window to a proper energy regime .",
    "finally , we have so far focused on investigating the rdf induced transmission fluctuation in nanostructures , our theory and numerical implementation can be applied to study many other physical quantities such as the shot noise , the fluctuation of threshold voltage , as well as the device variability in spintronics .",
