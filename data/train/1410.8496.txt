    "semileptonic @xmath4 decays like @xmath5 and @xmath6 are very useful for precision tests of the standard model and for probing new physics ( np ) . to fully understand such decays",
    ", it is essential to model the strong interaction between the quark and antiquark forming the final light meson .",
    "this is a challenging non - perturbative problem which we address here using a relatively new tool named the anti - de sitter / quantum chromodynamics ( ads / qcd ) correspondence . a remarkable feature of the ads / qcd correspondence , recently discovered by brodsky and de tramond ,",
    "is referred to as light - front holography @xcite . in light - front qcd , with massless quarks",
    ", the meson wavefunction can be written in the following factorized form @xcite : @xmath7 with @xmath8 satisfying the so - called holographic light - front schroedinger equation ( hlfse ) @xmath9 in the above equations , @xmath10 is the orbital angular momentum quantum number and @xmath11 is the mass of the meson .",
    "the variable @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the transverse distance between the quark and antiquark forming the meson and @xmath14 is the fraction of the meson s momentum carried by the quark . remarkably , the hlfse maps onto the wave equation for strings propagating in ads space if @xmath15 is identified with the fifth dimension in ads .",
    "the confining potential @xmath16 in physical spacetime is then determined by the perturbed geometry of ads space .",
    "in particular , a quadratic dilaton field breaking the conformal invariance of ads space yields a harmonic oscillator potential in ordinary spacetime , i.e. @xmath17 where @xmath18 . the holographic light - front wavefunction for a vector meson @xmath19 then becomes @xmath20          \\right \\ } \\label{ads - qcd - wfn}\\ ] ] with @xmath21 and where the dependence on quark masses has been introduced using a prescription by brodsky and de tramond .",
    "this holographic wavefunction has been used to successfully predict diffractive @xmath0-meson electroproduction @xcite .",
    "the distribution amplitudes ( das ) of the meson are related to its light - front wavefunction which in turn can be obtained using ads / qcd . for vector mesons such as @xmath0 or @xmath22 , there are two such das at twist-@xmath23 accuracy .",
    "the das are important because they are inputs in the light - cone sum rules computations of @xmath24 and @xmath25 transition form factors .",
    "these form factors are in turn required to compute the decay rates of @xmath5 and @xmath26 .",
    "the leading twist-@xmath23 das for vector mesons are related to the meson light - front wavefunction as follows @xcite :     @xmath27 \\frac{\\phi_l(r , z)}{z(1-z ) } \\ ;          \\label{phiparallel - phil}\\ ] ] @xmath28 \\frac{\\phi_t(r , z)}{z(1-z ) } \\ ;          \\label{phiperp - phit}\\ ] ] the form factors are then obtained from the das using the light cone sum rules as explained in reference @xcite .",
    "for example , our predictions for the tensor form factors @xmath29 , as a function of the momentum transfer squared , are shown in figures [ t1rho ] and [ t1kstar ] .",
    "the total differential decay width for @xmath2 is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 and transverse and longitudinal helicity amplitudes for the decay @xmath32 are given by @xcite @xmath33 and @xmath34    respectively .",
    "@xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are @xmath38 transition form factors which we calculate using ads / qcd das .    the babar collaboration has measured partial decay widths in three different @xmath39 bins@xcite :    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     so that @xmath40 our predictions for the above ratios are :    @xmath41 @xmath42    respectively , for two different quark mass values @xmath43 gev .",
    "we shall now consider @xmath44 dileptonic decay mode .",
    "we first compute @xmath45 form factors for low to intermediate values of @xmath39 using ads / qcd das .",
