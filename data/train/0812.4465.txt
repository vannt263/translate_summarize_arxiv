    "magnetism on the sun occurs on all scales .",
    "it manifests itself at the largest scales as a mean - field component that covers an entire hemisphere , and on progressively smaller scales as active regions , sunspots , and pores . magnetic field in the lower solar atmosphere has structure on the smallest observable scales , up to the diffraction limit of the best telescopes .",
    "theoretical arguments and simulations indicate that there is structure well beyond what can be observed today or in the forseeable future .",
    "a comprehensive ab - initio model of magnetic activity is currently impossible from a practical standpoint , and will remain so in the near future .",
    "the complex interaction of magnetic field , hydrodynamics , and radiative transfer requires sophisticated numerical analysis .",
    "a simulation would have to cover a substantial surface area over a good fraction of the convection zone in order to capture large - scale patterns such as supergranulation , yet also have sufficient resolution to capture interactions on scales of several kilometers or less .",
    "such a simulation is prohibitively expensive in terms of computation time . in order to gain understanding of the physical processes involved in the creation , evolution , and eventual destruction of magnetic field",
    ", we must turn to observations to study the properties of magnetic structures .",
    "granular flows in the photosphere expunge field from cell interiors .",
    "flux is swept into the intergranular lanes , where it clumps in small concentrations of mostly vertical field with strengths in excess of one kilogauss .",
    "bright points and faculae , the most conspicuous features of magnetism in the lower solar atmosphere , correspond to these small concentrations of field .",
    "they are well - known in active regions , where they group together in plages . in the quiet sun ,",
    "supergranular flows concentrate them in the magnetic network that incompletely outlines supergranular cells .",
    "internetwork quiet - sun magnetism has been somewhat ignored historically , largely due to a lack of observations with sufficient resolution and accuracy .",
    "however , it has attracted particular interest in the past years , and this subject is currently being studied vigorously .",
    "isolated concentrations of strong field that produce bright points and faculae also exist in supergranular interiors . outside",
    "the concentrations , much weaker field that is not predominantly oriented perpendicular to the surface is ubiquitously present .",
    "this more horizontal field typically does not produce bright points that are easily observed using proxy - magnetometry diagnostics such as imaging in the fraunhofer g band . instead , sensitive magnetometers are required to observe and study weak field .",
    "the development of new instrumentation and seeing - mitigating techniques ( the spectropolarimeter instrument on the space - borne observatory hinode is an excellent example of both ) , and advanced simulations facilitated by the steadily increasing processing power of computers have made it possible to study this subject in detail .    here , we focus our attention on magnetic fine structure of the quiet solar photosphere . in particular , we will discuss internetwork field .",
    "quiet - sun internetwork areas cover the majority of the solar surface .",
    "four orders of magnitude more flux emerges in the internetwork than in active regions .",
    "consequently , field in these areas is of importance in understanding certain aspects of solar magnetic activity , such as the existence and workings of a granular dynamo and the dynamical coupling of the photosphere to higher layers .",
    "we aim to provide a comprehensive review of quiet - sun internetwork magnetic fine structure , starting with a general overview in sect .",
    "[ sec : qsmf ] .",
    "we then address several small - scale phenomena that have recently attracted particular attention as a result of new , high - resolution observations : properties of horizontal field in the photosphere ( sect .",
    "[ sec : thmf ] ) , polar field ( sect .",
    "[ sec : pf ] ) , and concentrations of strong vertical field ( sect .",
    "[ sec : bpme ] ) .",
    "section  [ sec : urmf ] concludes the chapter with a discussion on unresolved fields .",
    "the magnetic field found in the quiet sun can be categorized into network and internetwork field .",
    "the latter were discovered by @xcite on the basis of a weak stokes @xmath0 signal found in the interiors of supergranular cells .",
    "a separate category , the turbulent field , has also been proposed .",
    "it is not clear which of the further proposed types of quiet - sun magnetic fields , such as ` granular fields ' @xcite , horizontal quiet - sun fields @xcite , or ` seething fields ' @xcite describe independent types of magnetic structures , and which are just different names for the same physical entity , detected in different types of observational data .",
    "the different techniques used to detect and study them pose the main difficulty with identifying one with the other .",
    "e.g. , internetwork fields have traditionally been measured using the zeeman effect , while the turbulent field has been probed mainly through the hanle effect .",
    "because of the cancellation of the zeeman signal in the presence of opposite - polarity longitudinal fields in the resolution element , a tangled field may largely escape detection through the zeeman effect , especially if the field is intrinsically weak .",
    "only the larger scales of such a turbulent field would be seen using zeeman - based diagnostics .",
    "these may then appear like internetwork elements , which in this scenario would represent just the tip of the iceberg of the sun s turbulent field .",
    "there have also been suggestions that the magnetic fluxes of all magnetic features in the photosphere form similar patterns irrespective of the scale at which they are observed .",
    "this scale invariance is consistent with the proposal that the magnetic field forms a fractal ( or multifractal ) pattern at the solar surface . since magnetic features",
    "are moved around by the evolving convection cells , possibly such an analysis provides more information on the distribution of convection at different scales , rather than on intrinsic magnetic properties .",
    "convective eddies are expected to be self - similar for a turbulent medium , such as the solar convection zone .        in principle , it is possible to detect magnetic features and partly to estimate their magnetic flux in a variety of ways .",
    "however , the different types of measurements give different results , so that some uncertainty remains on just how much magnetic flux the quiet sun harbors .",
    "contrasts in more or less narrow wavelength bands are widely used as proxies of the magnetic field , since they are easy to observe at high resolution even under variable seeing conditions .",
    "they include the brightness in the g band ,  or k line core , or cn bandhead .",
    "these proxies are , however , not ideal for determining the magnetic flux in the quiet sun , due to their small sensitivity .",
    "there is still some uncertainty to what extent internetwork magnetic features produce visible signatures in these proxies .",
    "the zeeman effect not only provides quantitative measurements of the magnetic vector , but is also much more sensitive to small amounts of magnetic flux and has been shown to sense fluxes as low as @xmath1 ( or even less ) , particularly if the field is aligned along the line of sight ( i.e. , well visible in stokes @xmath0 , the net circular polarization ) .",
    "it suffers , however , from the fact that stokes @xmath0 is also sensitive to the direction in which the flux points ( towards or away from the observer ) , so that if there is a mixture of polarities on a sufficiently small scale , the signal in stokes @xmath0 can be canceled . in stokes @xmath2 and @xmath3 cancellation , although possible , is less likely ( it requires two transverse fields at right angles to each other in the resolution element ) .",
    "if the aim is to measure intrinsically weak , possibly turbulent fields , then the hanle effect is the method of choice .",
    "basically , the hanle effect allows the magnetic vector to be determined if the field strength lies within a fiducial range that depends on the observed spectral line .",
    "the hanle effect is generally sensitive to low intrinsic field strengths ( typical values are below a few @xmath4 , depending on the spectral line ) .",
    "of importance for the field in the quiet sun is that the hanle effect allows a weighted average of the field strength to be obtained even for a field that is isotropically distributed in the resolution element .",
    "such a field would be invisible to the zeeman effect as long as it does nt produce any significant broadening of the line profiles ( see below ) .",
    "the flux distribution in network elements has been determined by , e.g. , and @xcite ( cf .",
    "they all find an exponential increase in the number density of elements with decreasing flux , down to the sensitivity limit ( lying at @xmath5 for the investigation of @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to this result , @xcite obtain a non - exponential , non - power law distribution for the network fluxes and a different ( but also non - exponential , non - power law ) distribution for the internetwork field .",
    "they use a series of criteria to differentiate between the two , including location ( at the edges of supergranules or in their interior ) , proper motion speeds ( higher speed of internetwork elements ) , etc .",
    "the weakest fluxes of individual internetwork features that they record are @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite found that the rate of magnetic flux emergence in internetwork fields is roughly 100 times larger than in ephemeral active regions . in the latter it is another 100 times higher than in normal active regions",
    "therefore , the internetwork fields completely dominate the flux emergence .",
    "however , whether the internetwork fields dominate the total flux at any given time depends on the ratio of emergence time scale to decay time scale of the fields .",
    "intranetwork fields not just emerge at the highest rate , but also decay the most rapidly , so that their exact contribution to the instantaneous total magnetic flux is still unclear .",
    "prior to the hinode mission @xcite , the typical average field strength in the quiet sun obtained from zeeman effect measurements were a few gauss ( typically @xmath6@xmath7 ) .",
    "the estimates of and count as exceptions . at a spatial resolution of @xmath8 , obtained an average field strength of @xmath9 in the internetwork .",
    "compared the distributions of stokes @xmath0 amplitudes simultaneously observed in the infrared and the visible with the amplitudes of synthetic profiles computed in snapshots of mixed - polarity 3d mhd simulations harboring different amounts of magnetic flux .",
    "the mhd simulations of can be studied at a spatial resolution nearly an order or magnitude higher than the observations , so that mixed polarity magnetic flux that is canceled out in the observations can still be counted in the simulations . the magnetic flux in the simulation snapshot that gives the best fit to the stokes @xmath0 amplitude distributions of both , the infrared and the visible lines , is taken to represent the solar flux .",
    "in this manner , to first order , the problem that a part of the flux is canceled within each spatial resolution element of the observations is circumvented .",
    "just like , also obtained @xmath9 , but this value refers to a spatial resolution corresponding to the grid scale of the mhd simulations , a few @xmath10 . therefore , unless there are no magnetic structures below @xmath8 in size , the value found by is not consistent with the same value found by . from high resolution observations obtained by the hinode solar optical telescope ( sot , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and at the swedish solar telescope we know that smaller - scaled structures are quite common .",
    "recently , analysis of hinode spectropolarimeter ( sp ) data by @xcite has yielded @xmath11 for the longitudinal field .",
    "the fact that hinode data ( at the significantly higher and stable resolution of @xmath12 ) reveal only half as much flux as the investigation of suggests that fluctuations due to seeing may have affected the data of in a way that it increased the strength of the @xmath0 signal , which is quite conceivable ( cross - talk from brightness or velocity into stokes @xmath0 can happen quite easily ) .",
    "an important question is how much flux could be hidden below the spatial scales that can be resolved ?",
    "such a hidden field ( i.e. , field not visible in magnetograms ) is generally referred to as turbulent field , since in order to be invisible the two magnetic polarities must be mixed at scales below the spatial resolution element .",
    "although very often no clear distinction is made to internetwork fields ( which often also show a nearly random distribution of opposite polarities ) , we could consider internetwork fields as the large - scale and hence roughly resolved parts of the `` turbulent '' field , some fraction of which remains unresolved .",
    "however , given our current knowledge , we can not rule out that the latter is physically different from the internetwork fields in some important aspect .",
    "@xcite was the first to look for an unresolved `` turbulent '' field ( that to first order was expected to be isotropic ) . using differential line",
    "broadening he was able to set an upper limit of @xmath13 on such a field . and",
    "later stenflo ( private communication ) greatly improved the sensitivity of the technique by extending the investigation to hundreds of spectral lines ( all the unblended  lines in the visible solar spectrum ) , resulting in an upper limit of @xmath4 for the field outside the network , which includes the area - weighted contribution of the internetwork field and of any turbulent field .",
    "early work on the determination of unresolved magnetic flux using the zeeman effect was also carried out by @xcite , who analyzed stokes @xmath14 , @xmath2 , and @xmath0 profiles and set limits on a combination of magnetic field inclination and field strength .",
    "@xcite used high spatial resolution observations to circumvent the problem of cancellation of stokes @xmath0 by opposite polarity fields .",
    "they found that a possible turbulent field can not exceed @xmath4 at spatial scales accessible to observations with a spatial resolution of @xmath8 .    from the hanle depolarization of the resonant polarization of lines formed in the quiet sun s photosphere ( mainly from the  line at @xmath15 , but also from molecular lines ) , a turbulent magnetic field in the range of roughly @xmath16@xmath17 has been inferred .    with time , the investigations have increased in sophistication , now including multi - dimensional polarized radiative transfer and atmospheres produced by 3d radiation - hydrodynamic simulations . in general , a field of this average strength covering the whole quiet sun harbors less magnetic energy than the field in the network . has argued , however , that ( under certain assumptions ) the measurements made in the  line actually imply that more than half of the sun s surface is covered by fields stronger than @xmath17 , even if the measurements give average field - strength values below @xmath17 .",
    "@xcite also favor a higher energy density in the internetwork than in the network field ( deduced from observations obtained at irsol by ) .",
    "they adopt an exponential probability distribution function ( pdf ) for the field strength , as derived from mhd simulations . for a single pdf of the magnetic field",
    ", they find an e - folding width of @xmath18 ( deduced from the same observations as give a @xmath17 average field ) .",
    "finally , they introduced different pdfs of the field in granules and intergranular lanes , with @xmath19 in the former structures and with @xmath20 in the latter , in order to simultaneously satisfy  ( atomic ) and  ( molecular ) lines .",
    "the energy density in the turbulent field in this scenario is larger than in the network .",
    "further work on this topic , e.g. , which tests the assumptions made by @xcite , would be of considerable interest .",
    "one question that has led to a partly heated debate over the last decade has been whether the magnetic fields in the internetwork quiet sun are intrinsically weak or strong . the magnetic field in the network",
    "has long been known to have an intrinsic strength on the order of a kilogauss , although a few advocates of weak fields , even in plage and the network remained .",
    "thus , @xcite argued that the highly zeeman sensitive  lines at @xmath21 only show weak fields , so that there are no strong fields in the network or in plages ( except in occasional micro - pores ) .",
    "however , detailed radiative transfer modeling of these lines by has shown that they are formed just below the temperature minimum in plage . at this height , due to pressure balance with the surrounding gas ,",
    "the field , which in the middle and lower photosphere is well over a kilogauss , has dropped to only a few hundred gauss .",
    "the observations of @xcite actually provided confirmation of the simple model of slender flux tubes ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , if extended to take into account the merging of neighboring features .",
    "more recently , the debate on the intrinsic strength of quiet sun fields has been rekindled , but now concentrating on the internetwork fields .",
    "the intrinsic field strength is much more difficult to measure accurately than the magnetic flux per feature , since the zeeman splitting often gives a non - unique result , except for kilogauss fields that fill a sufficiently large part of the aperture . here",
    ", measurements in the infrared have an advantage , since the ratio of zeeman splitting to doppler width scales roughly linearly with the wavelength .",
    "it is therefore not so surprising that intrinsically weak fields in the lower photospheric layers were initially observed in the infrared at @xmath22 .",
    "it also explains why studies of the strength of internetwork fields that employ infrared data ( all have used the zeeman sensitive line pair at @xmath22 ) give consistent results : the field strength of most internetwork features lies below roughly @xmath23 (; see also ) .",
    "these field strengths are partly consistent with equipartition between magnetic energy density and convective energy density , although they also provide evidence for a partial convective collapse .",
    "observations of spectral lines in the visible have given rather varied intrinsic strengths of internetwork fields .",
    "partly the results depend on the employed spectral lines , but they can also differ between studies using the same set of lines .",
    "an initial investigation by employing stokes @xmath0 measurements of  @xmath24 and  @xmath25 could not determine the true field strength , but provided evidence for a field strength below a kilogauss .",
    "interest in these lines has been dormant until very recently when @xcite and @xcite have studied them in comparison with the more widely used @xmath26 and @xmath27 line pair as well as the @xmath22 lines .",
    "most widely used have been the  line pair at @xmath26 and @xmath27 which have been observed by , e.g. , the advanced stokes polarimeter ( asp , @xcite ) and now the hinode sp .",
    "magnetograms in these lines , recorded with the gttingen fabry - perot at the vtt , have been investigated by .",
    "they found magnetic flux throughout the quiet sun ( covering @xmath28 of the surface area , typically located in the intergranular lanes ) .",
    "in addition , this flux , which corresponds to most of the flux in the internetwork , was found to be in the form of kilogauss fields .",
    "spectroscopic investigations employing asp data by @xcite did not reproduce the preponderance of strong fields , while the analysis of @xcite indicated a mixture of strong and weak fields ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite , from a comparison of visible and infrared lines , also found a mixture of field strengths , although in their case the visible lines gave strong fields , while the infrared lines indicated weak ones ( see further below for a more detailed discussion of this result ) .",
    "most recently , these lines , as recorded by hinode / sp , have been analyzed by @xcite .",
    "in contrast to earlier authors , they obtained weak fields with strengths in the range of equipartition with the convection .",
    "note that in contrast to , e.g. , , they inverted the full stokes vector .    finally , a zeeman - effect based diagnostic has been developed by .",
    "it makes use of the change in line profile shape introduced by hyperfine structure in  lines in the visible part of the spectrum ( @xmath29 ) as the field strength increases . applying this diagnostic to measurements of stokes @xmath14 and",
    "@xmath0 in the internetwork they obtain mainly hectogauss fields ( which cover the majority of the area and contain the majority of the flux ) , although they do not give precise numbers regarding the field strength .",
    "this result is confirmed by @xcite employing a  line in the infrared ( at @xmath30 ) .",
    "@xcite , however , argue that in a misma - like atmosphere ( micro - structured magnetic atmosphere , an approximation to describe the influence on the stokes profiles of an atmosphere with the magnetic field structured at a very small , optically thin scale ; @xcite ) the  line at @xmath31 will indicate weak fields even if more than @xmath32 of the magnetic flux is in the form of kilogauss fields .",
    "the difference between the results obtained with the infrared @xmath22 and those from the visible @xmath33 lines has fueled the aforementioned debate on the true field strengths of internetwork fields .",
    "it has also led the groups using either one of these diagnostics to comment on the shortcomings of the other .",
    "for example , it has been argued that the visible lines miss much of the weak fields , since for incomplete zeeman splitting ( which is the case for these lines for sub - kilogauss fields ) the signal in a given pixel is proportional to the magnetic flux in that pixel .",
    "since the internetwork fields are associated with very small fluxes per pixel , these lines could miss a considerable portion of it .",
    "also , because intrinsically weak fields change the shapes of the @xmath14 and @xmath0 profiles only in subtle ways , the deduced values are susceptible to noise or systematic errors .",
    "conversely , it has been argued by @xcite that the infrared lines , by dint of their large zeeman sensitivity , give too much weight to the weak fields .",
    "for these lines , the amplitude of the stokes @xmath0 signal is proportional to the fractional area covered by the field ( the magnetic filling factor ) rather than to the amount of magnetic flux in the pixel . therefore , fields with a low strength give proportionately stronger signals ( for , e.g. , an equal amount of magnetic flux in intrinsically weak and intrinsically strong fields ) .",
    "@xcite argue that the rapid drop of the field strength with height ( due to pressure balance ) compounds this effect : since a spectral line is formed over a range of heights , this gradient of the field spreads the signal in the wavelength direction .",
    "since the intrinsically strong fields are associated with the largest vertical field - strength gradients , the smearing in the wavelength direction is largest for such fields , making the stokes amplitudes small and possibly hidden in the noise .",
    "consequently , they argue , the infrared lines are missing much of the flux in the strong fields .",
    "( left panel ) and in the visible at @xmath33 ( right panel ) obtained simultaneously and co - spatially with the vtt on tenerife .",
    "greater brightness indicates larger amounts of magnetic flux per pixel .",
    "opposite magnetic polarities are bounded by red and by blue lines , respectively . adapted from . ]",
    "a comparison of the results obtained from the infrared and the visible lines of a simultaneously observed patch of quiet sun might be a way of deciding between the different diagnostics and associated points of view .",
    "such a comparison was first carried out by @xcite , who found that the stokes maps in the two wavelength ranges looked quite different . in particular",
    ", they noted that the visible and infrared lines displayed opposite polarities in 25% of the pixels , which was a remarkably high proportion .",
    "if correct , this would indeed support the view that the infrared and visible lines were sampling rather different components of the internetwork field .",
    "the main drawback with this investigation was that data from different telescopes had been used , so that the seeing quality of the two data sets was not comparable , making their comparison less straightforward @xcite . in a later analysis , compared visible and infrared lines observed with the same telescope under identical seeing conditions and obtained a more similar distribution of polarities and fluxes from both wavelength ranges .",
    "the magnetograms obtained in both wavelength ranges are shown in fig .",
    "[ irvis_khomenko ] .",
    "remaining differences between the two images are due to the larger sensitivity of the infrared line to weak fields and to the remaining unavoidable differences in seeing ( which possesses a dependence on @xmath34 ) .    finally , @xcite inverted a set of combined infrared and visible spectra using a 3-component model , which allowed a field - free component to co - exist with two different magnetic components .",
    "they obtained a mixture of strong and weak fields , with a clear relationship between magnetic field strength and magnetic flux in the sense that the larger the magnetic flux in a pixel , the stronger the field ( left panel of fig .  [ b_vs_avgeb ] ) .",
    "this result is similar to that found by , based purely on @xmath22 spectropolarimetry , shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ b_vs_avgeb ] .",
    "an increase of field strength with magnetic flux of the feature is in agreement with predictions of the efficiency of the convective collapse mechanism that leads to the formation of the intense flux tube @xcite . as in their earlier papers ,",
    "@xcite argue that most of the flux and of the magnetic energy is in the kilogauss fields .",

    "adapted from .,title=\"fig : \" ]    many of the investigations discussed so far have been based on stokes @xmath14 and @xmath0 profiles only .",
    "this can be explained partly by instrumental constraints , partly by the fact that the stokes @xmath2 and @xmath3 profiles scale as @xmath37 , while stokes @xmath0 scales proportionally to @xmath38 . for a relatively weak zeeman splitting ( typical of visible lines in the quiet sun ) this implies that @xmath2 and @xmath3 are much weaker than @xmath0 .",
    "the difficulty of measuring the field strength reliably from just @xmath14 and @xmath0 of a visible line pair , in particular from  @xmath39 and @xmath40 , has been demonstrated by . they fit a set of these line profiles two times , once starting from a strong-@xmath38 initial guess , once from a weak-@xmath38 initial guess .",
    "the final result depended strongly on the initial guess , although the fits to the profiles were equally good .",
    "the differences in the stokes profiles produced by the different field strengths were completely compensated by slightly different temperatures and turbulence velocity values returned by the inversion code .",
    "another test was carried out by @xcite .",
    "they used the output atmospheres from the 3d radiation - mhd simulations of to test a number of diagnostics of the field strength . according to their analysis",
    "the most reliable of the tested diagnostics is the @xmath22 line pair , the least reliable the @xmath39/@xmath40 line pair .",
    "these exercises have demonstrated just how difficult it is to obtain reliable @xmath38 values from this latter line pair , in particular if only stokes @xmath14 and @xmath0 are available .",
    "consequently , results obtained from such data have to be interpreted with caution .",
    "the great advantage of also having a linear polarization profile available is that the shape of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 profiles changes with the field strength , in the sense that the ratio of the strength of the @xmath41-component to the @xmath42-components depends on @xmath38 , providing further ( although not in themselves unique ) constraints on the field strength , as demonstrated by , e.g. , .",
    "more recently , the advent of hinode has opened up new possibilities , by providing @xmath14 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath0 spectra of  @xmath39 and @xmath40 at a constant high spatial resolution corresponding to approximately @xmath43 .",
    "recent inversions by @xcite indicate that the hinode data give mainly weak fields ( hectogauss ) , possibly because of the additional constraints provided by the linear polarization signals ( only pixels with profiles lying above a given threshold in stokes @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath0 are inverted ) .",
    "evidence for horizontal fields in the internetwork can be noted already in data published by @xcite : in these magnetograms internetwork fields are visible from the center of the solar disk right to the limb , suggesting the presence of both vertical and horizontal fields . with considerable foresight ,",

    "finally , @xcite obtained 5  times more flux in horizontal fields than in the vertical fields in the internetwork ( to be more specific : they found that the spatially averaged strength of the horizontal field is 5 times larger than of the vertical field ; a precise determination of the flux for horizontal fields is rather difficult from stokes parameters ) . with a strength of @xmath50@xmath17 , it is comparable to the values obtained by the hanle effect ( see sect .

    "the amount of the vertical magnetic flux in the plage in the case presented here is about 8  times larger than that of the quiet sun @xcite .",
    "if the thmf occurrence rate was in any way directly related to the global vertical fields forming the plage region , then we would expect the occurrence rate in the plage region to be much larger than that of the quiet sun .",
    "the similar occurrence rates we observe suggest that the emergence of the thmfs does not have a direct causal relationship with the vertical magnetic fields in the plage region . the same thmf occurrence rate ,",
    "no preferred orientation , and similar field - strength distributions for both regions strongly suggest that a common local process that is not directly influenced by global magnetic fields produces thmfs @xcite . as ( 1 )",
    "ubiquitous thmfs are receptive to convective motion , and ( 2 ) the field strength is essentially smaller than the equipartition field strength , a reservoir of thmfs may be located near solar surface , and these magnetic fields are carried to the surface through convective flow .",
    "such reservoir can be maintained by a local dynamo process due to near - surface convective motion .",
    "indeed , numerical simulations have shown that a local dynamo can generate horizontal magnetic structures in the quiet sun .",
    "such a local dynamo process could naturally explain the similarity in occurrence rates and field strength pdfs , including the fact that thmfs do not have a preferred orientation .",
    "the similarity in field - strength distribution also indicates that properties of thmfs do not depend on the seed field , e.g. , global fields .",
    "other possibilities for the origin of thmfs include debris from decaying active region , magnetic fields that failed to emerge from the convection region to the photosphere @xcite , and extended weak magnetic fields in the upper convection zone generated by `` explosion '' @xcite .",
    "if the reservoir is maintained by one of these processes , the thmfs would be expected to be affected by global toroidal fields in terms of properties of thmfs described above . within the context of these simulations",
    "cited above , it may be difficult to explain the observed properties of thmfs such as the similarity in the occurrence rates and magnetic field distributions , and the lack of preferred orientation of thmfs .",
    "a slight preferred orientation of thmfs with higher lp toward the global plage polarity suggests that these thmfs may be influenced by the global plage field .",
    "however , because any strong vertical fields associated with the emergence of these thmfs are not observed , they are probably not directly created from the vertical magnetic fields forming the plage as suggested by @xcite .",
    "thus , even if these thmfs with higher lp are related by the global toroidal system , the relationship would be indirect  the thmfs with high lp may result from fragmented elements of plage flux tossed about by the convective motions below the photosphere .",
    "the evidence that a local dynamo is playing a significant role for the quiet sun magnetism comes from the hanle - effect investigation by @xcite , who inferred a magnetic energy density which is the order of 20% of the kinetic energy density produced by the convective motions in the quiet solar photosphere , and showed that the observed scattering polarization signals do not seem to be modulated by the solar cycle .",
    "the papers using observations from hinode cited here are providing us with multiple new pieces of evidence in favor of a local dynamo process taking place in the convective turbulent outer layer of the sun .",

    "while proxy - magnetometry is comparatively simple , it is unable to continuously follow field concentrations if they are detected , and results based on these techniques are thus not just biased toward those concentrations that produce bright points , but also to the properties of those concentrations at the time that they are correctly angled to produce bright points .",
    "proxy - magnetometry misses a significant portion of flux that never becomes sufficiently concentrated to produces bright points , and is insensitive to field polarity .",
    "it is important that results found through proxy - magnetometry be validated against measurements using a direct diagnostic of magnetic field .",
    ".,width=332 ]    figure  [ fig : globsamples ] shows two illustrative examples of isolated magnetic elements in line - of - sight magnetograms and proxy - magnetometry diagnostics .",
    "the elements appear similar in the magnetogram , yet only one has clear associated bright points in both g - band and  filtergrams .",
    "the other does not produce bright points , perhaps because the field is sufficiently angled away from the line of sight , or perhaps because the granulation around it is broken up and there is not enough proximity of hot granular walls to make a bright point .",
    "these magnetic elements can exhibit different dynamics , as the one in the bottom row may not be buffeted by granulation as much as the one in the top row . a study using a proxy - magnetometry diagnostic",
    "may therefore give different results than one based on true magnetometry .",
    "kilogauss fields that produce bright points can also be found in internetwork areas .",
    "though their existence was already noted in early studies of bright points @xcite , these fields have been largely ignored historically , likely because bright points are more isolated in the internetwork and thus much harder to identify .",
    "there are fewer of them , and those that do exist are also more dynamic and have shorter lifetimes .",
    "these factors make detection and analysis difficult .",
    "recently , however , vigorous investigation of magnetic field in internetwork areas has been undertaken .",
    "many of the observations used in these studies are now available thanks to the development of new instruments , adaptive optics , and post - processing techniques .",
    "analysis of the distribution of field strength and filling factor in the photosphere has attracted particular attention @xcite .",
    "while there is some disagreement between results , weak field appears to be ubiquitously present in the internetwork , structured on small spatial scales ( see sect .  [",

    "@xcite , these observations also allow us to study emergence of field on small spatial and temporal scales .",
    "field is brought up inside a convective cell , then quickly expelled from the interior and swept into the lanes , where it may merge with pre - existing field .",
    "the entire process takes only a few minutes .",
    "several studies have focused on strong field that has associated bright points .",
    "the upshot is that internetwork field may become sufficiently concentrated to produce bright points , similar to network bright points , but more dynamic and with shorter lifetimes @xcite .",
    "the associated field has a longer lifetime than the bright point .",
    "the field exists before the bright point is formed and remains after it disappears , and may produce a bright point again at some later time .",
    "the lifetime of a bright point does not have a bearing on the lifetime of the underlying flux .",
    "rather , it is a measure of the dynamics of the associated flux , i.e. , how long the flux remains sufficiently aligned with the line of sight to produce a bright point , and also of the performance of the detection algorithm .",

    "the interiors of these cells are largely devoid of field .",
    "similar patterns have been found in active network @xcite .",
    "one would expect such a pattern to be set by granular motions .",
    "perhaps magnetic elements form these patterns as a result of flows associated with `` trees of fragmenting granules '' ( , previously called `` active granules '' by @xcite ) which were previously linked to mesogranules .",
    "flux is expunged by the sideways expansion of granular cells , and is collected in the downflows in intergranular lanes . in a `` tree of fragmenting granules '' , these flows would be expected to drive flux not only to the edges of individual granules , but also to the edges of the tree , resulting in a mesogranular pattern in the positions of magnetic field in internetwork areas .",
    "line - of - sight magnetograms , scaled between @xmath137 ( black ) and @xmath138 ( white ) .",
    "the field of view includes some network at the left .",
    "magnetic elements exhibit dynamic behavior , migrating distances of several arcseconds over a few hours , while experiencing many interactions with other elements during that time .",
    "they frequently seem to appear without a clearly associated opposite polarity .",
    "examination of adjacent slices indicates that such elements are not elements that emerged as a bipole previously and are now migrating into the current 2d slice .",
    "this indicates that the flux emerged at some earlier time , and was only detected when it became concentrated enough , or that the associated flux of opposite polarity is spread out below the detection limit of the instrument . from the same sequence as fig .",
    "[ fig : proxysample ] . ]    magnetic elements appear to obey largely gaussian distribution of horizontal velocity , as would be expected from random buffeting by granulation .",
    "their rms velocity is about @xmath139 in network and about @xmath140 in internetwork .",
    "granular motions are suppressed in the network , resulting in less dynamic behavior .",
    "magnetic elements in internetwork areas sometimes migrate large distances over periods of a few hours ( cf .",
    "fig  [ fig : slice ] ) , while having frequent interactions with other long - lived elements and transient concentrations of field .",
    "magnetic elements do not typically have an identity over periods longer than a few minutes because of these interactions .",
    "motions of bright points and magnetic elements in internetwork areas show positive autocorrelation up to at least delay times of @xmath16  minutes , indicating that the elements retain some memory of their motions over at least that much time .",
    "magnetic elements in internetwork areas have motions preferentially in the direction of the nearest network concentration @xcite .",
    "the likely culprit is thus supergranular flow .",
    "modeling of strong magnetic concentrations began with analytic studies of magnetostatic `` flux tubes '' @xcite .",
    "as computers became more powerful , numeric mhd models were created , increasing in complexity and realism over the years .",
    "early models were used to calculate properties of `` flux sheets '' in two dimensions .",
    "modern three - dimensional numerical models of magneto - convection now simulate mesoscale - areas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and are successful in reproducing magnetic elements and bright points in the solar photosphere",
    ". however , two - dimensional models remain popular @xcite , because adding the third dimension is computationally expensive .",
    "these models have shown that while the cause of brightness enhancement of magnetic elements in the photosphere differs subtly between various proxy - magnetometry diagnostics , it is in all cases rooted in the partial evacuation of the flux tube as a result of magnetic pressure .",
    "the reduced density places optical depth unity inside the flux tube at a geometrically deeper layer compared to outside , thus allowing radiation to escape from deeper , hotter layers ( cf .",
    "the left panel of fig  [ fig : fluxtubemodels ] ) .",
    "the internals of the flux tube are cooler at equal geometric height due to radiation losses , but are typically hotter at equal optical depth .",
    "this process only produces enhanced brightness in small - scale structures .",
    "larger concentrations of strong field that inhibit convection , e.g. , pores and sunspots , become dark because there is insufficient radial influx of radiation to make up for the increased losses as a result of reduced opacity .",
    "well - known diagnostics for proxy - magnetometry are used because they show more brightness enhancement than the continuum . as an example ,",
    "molecular lines such as those in the fraunhofer g band and the cn band are weakened in small concentrations of field because of the dissociation of molecules at lower densities and higher temperatures .",
    "opacity inside the flux tube is thus additionally reduced in these lines , and a higher emergent intensity integrated over the passband results .",
    "one recent highlight was the confirmation of the suggestion made by @xcite that facular brightness enhancement is the result of radiation escape from hot granular walls . @xcite and",
    "@xcite used sophisticated 3d mhd simulations to model flux tubes , then `` observed '' them as if close to the limb using intricate codes to calculate radiative transfer .",
    "partial evacuation of the flux tube allows the observer to look deeper into the hot granular wall than would be possible if the flux tube were absent .",
    "the dark lane often observed on the disk - ward side of faculae is formed in the cool layers above the granules and inside the flux tube .",
    "the prevailing theory on the formation of magnetic elements incorporates a convective instability known as `` convective collapse '' @xcite .",
    "field is brought up in granules and swept into the intergranular downdrafts .",
    "flux can accumulate until the magnetic energy density is roughly equal to the kinetic energy density of granular flows .",
    "this yields an equipartition field strength of about @xmath65 , insufficient to produce a bright point .",
    "the gas in these regions cools because convective energy transport is suppressed by the field .",
    "the cool , dense gas enhances the intergranular downflow , so that the region is effectively evacuated by gravity and consequently compressed until the internal magnetic pressure is sufficiently increased so that the region is again in horizontal pressure balance with the outside .",
    "theoretical calculations indicate that magnetic elements with field strengths of @xmath45@xmath71 result from this process .    the formation of kilogauss field concentrations from weak turbulent flux can be studied from models .",
    "typically , a hydrodynamic model is run until it reaches a more - or - less relaxed state",
    ". a constant vertical field is then added , and the simulation is allowed to evolve further . while this obviously does not resemble what happens on the sun , the process of convective collapse does still occur and indeed has been observed in simulations of magneotconvection .",
    "it is harder to observe convective collapse on the sun .",
    "accurate ( spectro)polarimetric observations with high resolution and reasonable cadence are required over some period of time .",
    "such observations are sensitive to seeing conditions , due to , e.g. , long exposure times required for polarimetry . the seeing - free hinode observatory is an obvious candidate to provide suitable observations .",
    "indeed , formation of a kilogauss field concentration by convective collapse was recently observed using the hinode spectropolarimeter and found to be in qualitative agreement with results from numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "these observations strongly support the model of convective collapse for the formation of kilogauss field concentrations .",
    "magnetoconvection in the rotating sun is the engine of the solar dynamo .",
    "it is therefore central to our understanding of the origin of solar and stellar activity .",
    "a main problem in modeling the solar dynamo is that magnetoconvection has such a tremendous dynamic range , about 8 orders of magnitude or more , as we will see below , while numerical simulations can handle only about 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "while numerical simulations provide valuable insights , the theory needs to be guided by observations .",
    "the magnetic - field observations refer to the surface layers ( photosphere ) , while the properties of magnetoconvection vary with depth in the convection zone .",
    "still , the photosphere can serve as our magnetoconvective laboratory , where we can explore the underlying physics .",
    "however , a major part of the magnetoconvective spectrum extends over scales that are too small to be resolved even with next - generation telescopes in any foreseeable future .",
    "one may therefore question to what extent knowledge about the behavior of these small unresolved scales is really needed for understanding solar and stellar dynamos and magnetic activity .",
    "the solar dynamo gives the impression of being governed by large - scale properties like hale s polarity law , joy s law , the emergence and dispersion of active - region magnetic flux , shearing by differential rotation , and meridional circulation , all of which take place in the spatially resolved domain . in sect .",
    "[ sec : role ] we will address the connection between the scales and the role of the smallest diffusion scales for the operation of the solar dynamo .    the upper end of the scale spectrum is naturally bounded by the size of the sun ( @xmath141 )",
    ". the lower end of the magnetic spectrum is reached when the turbulent motions are unable to tangle the field lines to produce magnetic structuring .",
    "this decoupling between the plasma motions and the magnetic field happens when the frozen - in condition ceases to be valid , i.e. , when the time scale of magnetic diffusion ( field - line slippage through the plasma ) becomes shorter than the time scale of convective transport .",
    "the ratio between these two time scales is represented by the magnetic reynolds number @xmath142 in si units . here",
    "@xmath42 is the electrical conductivity , @xmath143 the characteristic length scale , and @xmath144 the characteristic velocities .",
    "@xmath145 . when @xmath146 the field lines are effectively frozen in and carried around by the convective motions . when @xmath147 the field is decoupled from the turbulent motions and diffuses through the plasma .",
    "the magnetic structuring by magnetoconvection therefore ends at scales @xmath148 where @xmath149 . to calculate these scales we need to know how",
    "the characteristic turbulent velocity @xmath144 scales with @xmath143 .",
    "such a scaling law is given in the kolmogorov theory of turbulence .",
    "in the relevant inertial range it is @xmath150 where @xmath151 is a constant .",
    "an estimate of @xmath152 can be obtained from the observed properties of solar granulation ( ke nordlund , private communication ) .",
    "combining these two equations and setting @xmath153 , we obtain the diffusion scale @xmath154    to evaluate this we need the expression for the spitzer conductivity in si units , @xmath155 this gives us @xmath156 for @xmath157 ( a rounded value that is representative of the lowest part of the photosphere or upper boundary of the convection zone ) , @xmath158 .    if we limit ourselves to order - of - magnitude estimates , we may say that magnetic structuring in the surface layers ends at scales of about @xmath159 . as the upper bound of the magnetic scale spectrum is about @xmath160",
    ", it follows that the magnetoconvective scale spectrum spans about 8 orders of magnitude in the sun s observable surface layers .",
    "as the diffusion limit decreases with increasing temperature , it follows that the dynamic range of magnetoconvection increases , possibly by nearly two orders of magnitude more ( down to diffusion scales of cm ) as we go down in the convection zone and the temperature increases towards a million degrees .",
    "it might be objected that the rather simplistic kolmogorov scaling law is not very applicable in the highly stratified surface layers .",
    "however , the photospheric scale height of typically @xmath161 is about 4 orders of magnitude larger than the diffusion scales that we have derived .",
    "most of these scales are so small that they do not `` feel '' the stratification and therefore may behave in a way that is similar to isotropic kolmogorov turbulence .",
    "the magnetic fields that we see at the surface of the sun have been produced by dynamo processes in the solar interior .",
    "lifted by buoyancy forces , the dynamo - produced fields emerge as bipolar regions into the visible photospheric layers , but with an emergence rate that is a steep function of scale size .",
    "the large - scale bipolar regions , which represent active regions ( ar ) with sunspots , bring up about @xmath162 per day ( solar - cycle average ) , enough to account for the observed accumulation of flux and the large - scale background magnetic field over the course of the 11-year activity cycle .",
    "going down in scale to the so - called ephemeral active regions ( er ) , the flux emergence rate goes up by two orders of magnitude , to @xmath130 per day .",
    "going down to the still smaller internetwork fields ( in ) , the emergence rate increases to @xmath163 per day , another two orders of magnitude @xcite . while the characteristic scales of ar  :  er  :  in are in proportion @xmath164 ( @xmath165 ) , the emergence rates are in proportion @xmath166 .    with these high emergence rates",
    "the time scale for the turn - over or replenishment of the magnetic field pattern is not the solar cycle time scale but something much shorter .",
    "the first realization of a short turn - over time scale came two decades ago from a study of the differential rotation properties of the magnetic pattern .",
    "when determining the proper motion of magnetic elements through cross - correlation techniques @xcite , a steep differential rotation law is found , which closely agrees with the law derived from doppler measurements .",
    "when instead we form time series of the magnetic field sampled at the central meridian and perform an autocorrelation analysis to determine the period it takes for the pattern to recur after one solar rotation ( or any integer number of rotation periods ) , then a rotation law is found that is almost rigid .",
    "this dramatic difference between the cross - correlation and autocorrelation analyses can be naturally explained if the pattern replenishment time is much shorter than a rotation period , so that the `` recurring '' pattern is not actually recurring but is a new pattern that has emerged during the course of the rotation period .",
    "the nearly rigid differential rotation law then does not represent the surface ( in contrast to the steep differential rotation law ) , but reflects the differential rotation properties of the source region in the deep convection zone , from which the new surface fields emanate .",
    "this behavior can not be easily explained in terms of flux - redistribution models without high - latitude sources of new magnetic flux , like the model of @xcite , which are based on meridional circulation and a smooth surface diffusion process . in such models a quasi - rigid differential rotation law for the phase velocity of the magnetic pattern results , regardless of the lag used in the correlation analysis .",
    "the observed lag - dependence of the pattern phase velocity with a steep differential rotation law for small lags would not occur without the continual supply of new magnetic flux from the sun s interior at high latitudes . to avoid this contradiction between the flux - redistribution models and the observations",
    ", @xcite replaced the smooth diffusion in their model with a discrete random walk process on a supergranular lattice , as a means of producing discrete flux clumps at high latitudes from the old , smooth , redistributed flux .",
    "these clumps would then drift according to a steep differential rotation law .",
    "it is , however , questionable whether supergranular random walk can continually produce flux clumps of sizes larger than one arcmin ( the spatial resolution used in the correlation analysis of @xcite that gave the steep differential rotation law ) , much larger than the size of supergranules .",
    "a more natural explanation is that the magnetic pattern is really being replenished from the sun s interior on a time scale well below the solar rotation time scale .",
    "support for such a short pattern replenishment time has come from soho mdi magnetograms , revealing a `` magnetic carpet '' with a pattern turn - over time of @xmath167@xmath168 days @xcite .",
    "the problem with the high emergence rates is that they have to be matched by the flux _",
    "rates for a statistically stationary situation , otherwise the photosphere would quickly get choked with magnetic flux that is all the time injected from below .",
    "it is however difficult to identify the process by which flux is removed .",
    "this problem is generally avoided in dynamo models by letting opposite polarities mathematically cancel out when they are co - spatial .",
    "however , such mathematical cancellation is non - physical , magnetic flux can only be destroyed by a reconnection process involving concentrated electric currents and joule heating , and this can only occur fast enough if it takes place on the diffusion length scales ( of order @xmath159 in the photosphere ) .",
    "this implies an extreme and highly efficient shredding of the flux elements down to these scales , something that takes place almost entirely in the spatially unresolved domain and which is therefore not directly observed .",
    "flux removal may occur in basically three different ways : ( 1 ) in situ cancellation of opposite magnetic polarities ( reconnection ) .",
    "( 2 ) flux retraction ( reprocessing in the convection zone ) . ( 3 ) flux expulsion ( with a possible role of cmes ) .",
    "unfortunately , the relative contributions of these three processes are completely unknown .",
    "how impervious is the solar surface to the dynamo - produced magnetic flux ?",
    "how `` leaky '' is the solar dynamo ?",
    "these are fundamental questions that still have no answers .",
    "similar questions may be asked about the magnetic helicity .",
    "although reconnection is only mentioned explicitly in connection with the in situ cancellation , both flux retraction and flux expulsion could not happen without cutting off the field lines through reconnection .",
    "therefore , also for these processes , the basic physics takes place at the diffusion length scales , down to which the flux needs to be efficiently shredded . without this shredding ,",
    "the global dynamo would not be able to operate .",
    "the resolved scales now cover a dynamic range of almost four orders of magnitude ( from the global scales of @xmath160 down to the neighborhood of @xmath105 ) , approximately half of the range of the magnetoconvective scale spectrum .",
    "already back in the 1960s , in the early days of solar magnetography , when the dynamic scale range covered by the observations was only about two orders of magnitude , it was clear that the sun s magnetic field is very fragmented or intermittent , but the degree of intermittency or the nature of the structuring was not known . to get an insight into the hidden nature of the field it was necessary to develop indirect diagnostic techniques to overcome the resolution limit and derive intrinsic field properties that were not dependent on the quality of the telescopes used .",
    "a similar situation is encountered in stellar physics , where we derive the physical properties of the stellar atmospheres although the stars remain unresolved point objects .",
    "while crucial information on key field parameters like magnetic field strengths and filling factors can be obtained this way , we have no information on the unresolved field _ morphology _ , and the results depend on the interpretative models used .",
    "an exception is zeeman - doppler imaging of rapid rotators . by necessity",
    "these models have to be idealized to limit the number of free parameters , and they need to be tailored to the type of diagnostics that we use .",
    "thus the zeeman and hanle effects are sensitive to very different parameter domains of the field , as we will see in sect .",
    "[ sec : diagnostics ] .",
    "the situation has improved dramatically during the last decades .",
    "advances in spatial resolution have significantly extended the dynamic range of the resolved scales , allowing us to get a glimpse of how the magnetic pattern scales as we zoom in on ever smaller scales .",
    "numerical simulations have given us insights into the nature and scaling behavior of magnetoconvection when we go beyond the resolution limit into the unresolved domain .",
    "this allows us to get a better understanding of the nature of the field pattern and gives us guidance in the choice of the most realistic interpretative models to use to diagnose the spatially unresolved domain .    until a few years ago the `` standard model '' of photospheric magnetic fields was that the basic building blocks are strong - field ( mostly kilogauss ) highly intermittent flux tubes occupying a small fraction of the photospheric volume , and that the space between these flux tubes is filled with much weaker and highly tangled ( or `` turbulent '' ) fields",
    "we now realize that this `` two - component picture '' is mainly a product of the idealizations used when interpreting zeeman and hanle signatures of the spatially unresolved domain .",
    "instead the field appears to behave like a fractal .     of the solar disk , while the right map , obtained on the same day at disk center with the swedish la palma telescope ( courtesy gran scharmer ) covers an area that is 100  times smaller @xcite . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : fractal ] illustrates this fractal appearance of quiet - sun magnetic fields . if a magnetogram is presented without tick marks that indicate the spatial scale , it is very hard to guess what the scale is .",
    "the pattern seems to have a high degree of scale invariance , it looks statistically the same as we zoom in on ever smaller scales .",
    "further we have a coexistence of strong and weak fields over a large dynamic field strength range .",
    "the probability distribution function for the field strengths appears to be nearly scale invariant and can be described in terms of a voigt function with a narrow gaussian core and `` damping wings '' that extend out to the kilogauss values ( @xcite , but see also @xcite ) .",
    "such scale invariant properties are typical of a fractal .",
    "a fractal dimension of @xmath169 has been found for both the observed magnetic field pattern and the pattern that results from numerical simulations of magnetoconvection at scales that are smaller than the resolved ones .      like in any other area of astrophysics where we are dealing with spatially unresolved objects , we have to extract information about the physical conditions that is encoded as various types of signatures in the spectrum .",
    "to enable this extraction we make use of models that must have a smaller number of free parameters than the number of independent observables that we can use to constrain the model .",
    "a fundamental issue is the uniqueness and numerical stability of any such inversions .",
    "back in the 1960s it became clear that the measured field strengths on the quiet sun increased with the spatial resolution of the instrument , which led to the question what the strength would be if we had infinite resolution @xcite . to answer this question",
    "the line - ratio technique was devised , which led to the conclusion that more than @xmath170 of the net magnetic flux in the photosphere , as seen with modest spatial resolution ( larger than a few arcseconds ) , comes from highly bundled fields with a strength of @xmath45@xmath71 and a small volume filling factor ( typically @xmath171 ) @xcite .",
    "due to the tiny filling factor the average net field strength is only of order @xmath172 or less , although most of the field lines come from kilogauss flux patches in the photosphere .",
    "this result led to the concept of discrete magnetic flux tubes as the theoretical counterpart of the unresolved kilogauss flux fragments .",
    "the mechanism of convective collapse @xcite gained wide acceptance as the process leading to the spontaneous formation of kilogauss flux tubes .",
    "empirical flux tube models at increasing levels of sophistication were built @xcite .",

    "zeeman saturation due to strong , unresolved fields leaves a characteristic signature in the profile ratio , which allows the intrinsic field strength of the unresolved fields to be determined . ]    the classical line - ratio technique that allows a robust determination of the intrinsic field strength is based on the simultaneous observation of the circular polarization in the  @xmath173 and @xmath174 line pair @xcite",
    ". the observed circular polarization due to the longitudinal zeeman effect , illustrated in the fts spectrum of fig .",
    "[ fig : zeeman ] , depends on many combined factors , like the line depth and detailed line shape ( which in turn depend on the temperature - density stratification of the atmosphere and the details of line formation ) , the land factor , and the line - of - sight component of the magnetic field .",
    "in traditional magnetography one calibrates away the line - profile factors by recording the magnetograph response to artificial line shifts of the spatially averaged spectral line .",
    "this calibration procedure then gives us the average line - of - sight field strengths ( averaged over the spatial resolution element of the instrument ) , under the assumption that the relation between circular polarization and field strength is a linear one ( being the relation that is valid in the weak - field limit ) , and assuming that the line depth and line shape are the same in the magnetic elements as for the spatially averaged sun .",
    "however , both these assumptions are generally wrong . as the field strength increases ,",
    "the relation between circular polarization and field strength becomes increasingly non - linear .",
    "further , the temperature - density stratification of the atmosphere ( and thus the line profile ) is significantly different in the unresolved magnetic elements than outside them .",
    "the line - ratio technique allows us to isolate the magnetic - field effects from the line formation and temperature - density effects , to obtain a signature that can only occur if the field is intrinsically strong ( meaning that the polarization dependence on field strength lies in the non - linear regime ) . from the measured degree of non - linearity ( zeeman saturation )",
    "the value of the field strength can be extracted .",
    "the robustness of the method depends on the choice of line pair .",
    "no line pair has been found that better optimizes this robustness than the  @xmath173 and @xmath174 one .",
    "these two lines both belong to multiplet no .  1 of iron , have almost identical excitation potential , oscillator strength , and line depth , and therefore respond in the same way to the temperature - density stratification of the atmosphere , with the same line formation properties .",
    "the only significant difference between them is their effective land factors : @xmath175 for the @xmath176 line , @xmath177 for the @xmath174 line .",
    "if all fields were intrinsically weak , the circular - polarization stokes @xmath0 profiles of the two lines would have the same shapes and only differ in terms of a global amplitude scaling factor in proportion to their land factors ( @xmath178 ) .",
    "if we form the ratio @xmath179 , it would be unity if all fields were weak , regardless of the temperature - density stratification or line - formation properties of the solar atmosphere .",
    "it differs from unity only because of the _ differential non - linearity _ : the @xmath174 line with its larger land factor deviates more from linearity than the @xmath176 line .",
    "this line - ratio technique was applied before the advent of stokesmeters , using magnetograph exit slits in fixed positions of the line profiles @xcite .",
    "this was sufficient for obtaining robust field - strength determinations .",
    "with fully resolved stokes @xmath0 line profiles with high s / n ratio ( cf .",
    "[ fig : zeeman ] ) it became possible to test and verify the interpretation in great detail , since the zeeman saturation does not only suppress the stokes @xmath0 amplitudes but also broadens the stokes @xmath0 profile in a way that gives the @xmath179 ratio a very characteristic profile shape when plotted as a function of wavelength @xmath180 .",
    "thus the self - consistency and validity of the interpretational model could be verified ( for details , see @xcite ) .",
    "this interpretational model contained two components : one magnetic component with field strength and filling factor as the free parameters , and one non - magnetic component .",
    "the measured line ratio does not depend on filling factor , only on field strength .",
    "the filling factor enters when explaining the @xmath0 amplitudes of each line , since the amplitudes scale with both filling factor and field strength . since the line ratio was found to be practically identical in quiet network regions with little magnetic flux and in strong faculae with much flux , the conclusion was that the magnetic building blocks ( flux tubes ) have rather unique properties @xcite , almost always with field strengths of @xmath45@xmath71 .",
    "different regions on the sun ( outside sunspots ) then differ not so much in field strength , but rather in the number density or filling factor of the flux elements .",
    "this implies that the magnetograms , which show a continuous range of apparent field strengths , basically are maps of the filling factor , not of field strength .",
    "this view of solar magnetism has been confirmed with other combinations of spectral diagnostics , in particular with infrared lines ( e.g. , ) , which however have also revealed the existence of intrinsically weaker flux elements that are mixed in with the kilogauss ones . due to the larger zeeman",
    "splitting in the infrared it was possible to extend the 2-component approach to a 3-component one ( with two magnetic components ) , which revealed the existence of intrinsically weaker fields . with advances in spatial resolution it became possible to actually resolve and see the flux tubes that had been predicted by the line - ratio method , as first done with speckle polarimetry @xcite .      while all these results were self - consistent , the zeeman - effect observations left us with a picture where about @xmath181 of the photospheric volume ( outside the kilogauss flux elements ) was field free , which is non - physical , since nothing in the highly electrically conducting and turbulent photospheric plasma can be field free .",
    "the introduction of a `` non - magnetic '' component is exclusively for mathematical convenience .",
    "the question is what the magnetic nature of this component is .",
    "since its contribution to the zeeman - effect polarization signals is very small , it must either mean that the field is indeed extremely weak , or that the field is highly tangled with mixed polarities within the spatial resolution element , such that one has nearly perfect cancellation of the opposite signs of the spatially unresolved stokes @xmath0 signals ( in which case the field does not have to be weak ) .",
    "we now know through applications of the _ hanle effect _ that the second case is much closer to the truth .",
    "in contrast to the zeeman - effect polarization , the hanle effect is a coherency phenomenon that only occurs when coherent scattering contributes to the line formation .",
    "such scattering can produce linear polarization also in the absence of magnetic fields .",
    "the term hanle effect covers all the magnetic - field induced modifications of the scattering polarization .",
    "since it has different sensitivity and symmetry properties than the zeeman - effect polarization , it both responds to much weaker fields and does not suffer from the cancellation effects that make the zeeman effect `` blind '' to a tangled field .",
    "this property was first exploited by @xcite to derive a _",
    "lower _ limit of @xmath172 for the strength of the tangled field in the @xmath182 of the volume between the kilogauss flux tubes",
    ".    examples of hanle - effect signatures and how they differ from the zeeman effect are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hanle ] .",
    "the photospheric  line in the left panels has been extensively used by various authors to improve the constraints on the properties of the turbulent field for which the zeeman effect is blind .",
    "the most sophisticated constraints based on the use of probability distribution functions ( pdf ) have been derived by @xcite , indicating turbulent field strengths of order @xmath4 .",
    "such volume - filling fields contain so much magnetic energy that they may play a major role in the energy balance of the solar atmosphere .",
    "the hanle signatures of the strong  @xmath183 line ( right panels in the figure ) can be used to diagnose the horizontal magnetic fields in the solar chromosphere .",
    "assume that we have chosen our stokes coordinate system such that the non - magnetic scattering polarization is along the stokes @xmath2 direction .",
    "this direction is parallel to the nearest solar limb when observing on the solar disk in a zone near the limb ( which we most often do for such observations , since the scattering polarization amplitude increases as we get closer to the limb ) .",
    "the main polarization signatures of the hanle effect are depolarization ( reduction of the stokes @xmath2 amplitude ) and rotation of the plane of polarization ( appearance of signals in stokes @xmath3 ) .",
    "since however the hanle rotation angle can have both signs , a highly tangled field with equal contributions of plus and minus will lead to cancellations like for the zeeman effect , so there will be no stokes @xmath3 signatures from such fields .",
    "in contrast , the depolarization effect in stokes @xmath2 has only one `` sign '' ( reduction of the polarization amplitude ) , regardless of the field polarity , and is therefore immune to the above - mentioned cancellation effects .",
    "this is the signature of the turbulent fields that we have to work with .    for hanle diagnostics of the turbulent fields",
    "hanle depolarization gives us one observable per spectral line .",
    "for single - line observations , the interpretative model therefore can not contain more than one free parameter . since the introduction of this diagnostic technique ,",
    "the traditional model has been to assume a single - valued field with an isotropic angular distribution @xcite .",
    "the free parameter is the single - valued field strength .",
    "however , other more realistic model choices are beginning to be used , which are guided by the insights gained from numerical simulations of magnetoconvection and from analysis of magnetic - field distribution functions that have been determined from observations in the spatially resolved domain . from the observed scaling behavior of the resolved fields and the behavior of the smaller - scale fields in numerical simulations one can make educated guesses for the analytical shapes of the field strength probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) that should be used to model the behavior in the spatially unresolved domain . with a single hanle observable ( the depolarization for a single spectral line ) we must then limit ourselves to characterize the model pdf with a single free parameter , for instance by keeping the relative shape invariant and using a stretching factor as the free parameter .",
    "such an approach has been applied with success for data with the  @xmath15 line @xcite .",
    "the hanle effect however does not at all limit us to use such simplistic , one - parameter models .",
    "they are only used because the application of the hanle effect to the diagnostics of spatially unresolved magnetoconvection is still in its infancy , and one needs to start with and fully understand the simplest approaches before proceeding to higher levels of sophistication .",
    "like with the line - ratio technique in the case of the zeeman effect , with the hanle effect one can also use a multi - line approach with simultaneous hanle observations in several spectral lines with different sensitivities to the hanle effect .",
    "such an application of the _ differential hanle effect _ increases the number of independent observables , which allows us to increase the number of free parameters of the interpretative models and thus enhance the degree of realism .",
    "while most lines differ not only in their hanle sensitivities but also in their line formation properties , which adds considerable complication to the inversion problem , there exist certain pairings of molecular lines for which the line formation properties are identical , the only difference being the hanle sensitivities .",
    "this allows the magnetic - field effects to be isolated from the other non - magnetic effects , similar to what is done with the @xmath184/@xmath173 zeeman - effect line ratio .",
    "this has the great advantage of making the inversion much more robust and the derived field strengths less model dependent .",
    "the zeeman and hanle effects are highly complementary .",
    "the longitudinal zeeman - effect signals represent the net magnetic flux that often ( but not always ) has its main sources in the highly bundled strong fields , but they carry nearly zero information on the spatially unresolved volume - filling weaker , tangled fields between the intermittent stronger fields .",
    "let us here recall that nearly four orders of magnitude in spatial scales lie unresolved below the current spatial resolution limit of magnetograms ( as represented by hinode , cf .",
    "[ sec : range ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the hanle effect is almost blind to the flux - tube like fields , for three reasons : ( 1 ) the effect scales with the filling factor , which is very tiny for the flux - tube fields ( of order @xmath171 ) .",
    "( 2 ) the hanle effect is insensitive to vertical fields , and the strong fields tend to be nearly vertical due to the strong buoyancy forces acting on them . ( 3 ) the hanle effect completely saturates for fields stronger than a few hundred gauss .",
    "the complementary nature of the two effects has in the past led to the choice of two apparently contradictory interpretative models used for each effect : for the zeeman effect the two - component model ( or extended variations thereof , with additional components ) with the concept of a magnetic filling factor , for the hanle effect a volume - filling field ( filling factor of unity ) with an isotropic distribution of field vectors .",
    "this apparent dichotomy in the diagnostic methods arises because each of the zeeman and hanle effects provides an incomplete , filtered view of the underlying reality , which in a unified picture is fractal - like , and which may best be characterized in terms of probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "when we `` put on our zeeman goggles '' , we project out properties of the strong - field tail of the pdf , which appears flux - tube like .",
    "when , on the other hand , we `` put on our hanle goggles '' , we project out properties of the weak - field portion of the pdf . however , the application of unified pdf models for both zeeman and hanle diagnostics is still in its infancy , and the initial results are only tentative , because the information we have that could guide our choice of distribution functions is still very incomplete .",
    "the incompleteness mainly lies in the lack of information on the angular distribution function of the field , not so much in the pdf for the field strengths , for which we have reasonably good analytical functions to work with .",
    "the angular distribution is expected to be closely coupled to the field - strength distribution . from theoretical considerations",
    "we expect the stronger fields to have an angular distribution that is fairly peaked around the vertical direction , since they are more affected by the vertical buoyancy forces while resisting bending and tangling by the turbulent motions .",
    "the weakest fields on the other hand are expected to have a much wider angular distribution , since the dominating effect is the turbulent tangling of the passive fields . for intermediate field strengths we should have a gradual transition between the wide and the peaked angular distributions .",
    "the stokes profile signatures from such combinations of distribution functions for the spatially unresolved magnetic fields have recently been explored by radiative - transfer modeling @xcite , but such calculations have not yet been applied to model fitting of observational data .    a unique opportunity to obtain lacking observational information on the angular distribution functions would be with the sot data from the hinode spacecraft . a detailed exploration of the distribution functions of the quiet - sun vertical and horizontal magnetic fields with hinode data @xcite has given the surprising result that there seems to be five times more horizontal magnetic flux than vertical flux .",
    "furthermore , the patches of flux concentrations of vertical and horizontal fields are observed to be well separated , rather than co - spatial .",
    "there is convincing indirect evidence that most of the horizontal flux patches are not spatially resolved even with hinode but have a small filling factor , indicating intrinsic sizes of the underlying flux elements of at most @xmath185 .",
    "these intriguing results are not yet properly understood , so the angular distribution functions needed for our diagnostic models still remain elusive .",
    "while we have attempted to give a comprehensive overview of small - scale magnetic field in the solar atmosphere , this review is by no means complete .",
    "in particular , we have not touched upon chromospheric fields , which besides being structured on small scales , also display dynamic behaviour on short timescales .",
    "new instruments that are able to measure photospheric magnetic field in high - resolution and at sufficient cadence to study dynamics , either directly through ( spectro)polarimetry , or indirectly through proxy - magnetometry , are now availble to observers . in particular , we have discussed several results from the hinode mission . these results , while dealing with small - scale field , have great repercussions for important questions surrounding magnetism in the sun , and in particular for the existence and workings of both the local and global solar dynamos .    with new instruments and sophisticated modeling enabled by advances in computing , we have greatly improved our understanding of magnetic activity on all scales in the sun . yet , we have also seen that the end is not yet in sight : field is likely structured on scales well beyond what can be observed or simulated today or in the forseeable future .",
    "our understanding of the processes that give rise to small - scale magnetic field will continue to improve as more observations are analyzed , models become more sophisticated and lifelike , and new instruments are developed , such as the sunrise baloon - borne observatory @xcite or the advanced technology solar telescope @xcite .                                                                                                                                  ,",
