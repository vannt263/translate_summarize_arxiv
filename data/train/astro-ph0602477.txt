    "@xcite and @xcite discovered the first known transiting extrasolar giant planet ( egp ) , hd 209458b .",
    "transits are possible if the orbital plane of the planet is tilted along our direct line of sight . the detection of hd 209458b in transit has been a watershed in the study of planets around other stars because physical properties of the planet can be inferred directly from the transit data .",
    "the planet s orbit is nearly circular , with a period of 3.5257 days @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite have combined transit data with high - resolution spectra of the star to infer accurate values for the planet s mass and radius : @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "photons from hd209458b and the transiting planet tres-1 have recently been detected @xcite .",
    "in addition , transmission spectroscopy measurements , in which observers track changes in the star s spectral features while the planet is in transit , have unveiled key features of the composition of hd 209458b s atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the more recent detections of transiting planets ogle - tr-56b @xcite , ogle - tr-113b and 132b @xcite , tres-1 @xcite , ogle - tr-111b @xcite , ogle tr-10b @xcite , hd 149026b @xcite , and hd 189733b @xcite reinforce the importance of the transit method for the characterization of close - in egp atmospheres .",
    "hd 209458b resides in close proximity ( 0.046 au ) to a sun - like star in the constellation pegasus .",
    "the intense stellar heating of close - in egps drives global - scale atmospheric dynamics . as shown by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ,",
    "winds of @xmath7 carry material across a hemisphere in only @xmath8 .",
    "vertical transport is rapid as well , with typical wind speeds @xmath9 at @xmath10 bar ( see  [ section : analysis_interpretation ] ) .",
    "theory predicts that hd 209458b is locked by strong stellar tides to a synchronously rotating state , owing to the short time for spin - orbit synchronization of a planet at 0.046 au ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the planet therefore receives stellar radiation on one hemisphere only @xcite .",
    "various effects causing deviations from synchronous rotation have been explored in the literature , such as non - zero eccentricity or substantial obliquity pumped by the presence of another planet @xcite .",
    "however , the apparent lack of a third massive body in the system @xcite , as well as the timing of the transit and secondary eclipse @xcite , makes a large eccentricity or obliquity unlikely for this system .",
    "we study the atmosphere under the assumption of synchronous rotation .",
    "we note , however , that deviations from a completely synchronous state are conceivable .",
    "for example , effects of atmospheric tides are important on venus , as shown by @xcite . in an order - of - magnitude calculation",
    ", @xcite suggested that atmospheric dynamics could induce deviation from synchronous rotation by up to a factor of 2 .",
    "a factor of 2 is the extreme case ; 1020% deviation might be more typical .",
    "this estimate depends on the planet s tidal dissipation factor ( @xmath11 ) , as well as properties of the circulation itself and the processes transferring angular momentum and rotational kinetic energy from the atmosphere to the interior , which are highly uncertain .",
    "the g0v primary irradiates the planet up to an extremely high effective temperature ( @xmath12 k ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) compared to the planets of our solar system .",
    "this leads to very different chemistry than we are familiar with in planetary atmospheres .",
    "the atmosphere is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium .",
    "carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen are all minor constituents . despite their low abundances ,",
    "these elements are important for determining the spectral characteristics of the planet because they form molecules having strong spectral signatures @xcite .",
    "radiative - equilibrium calculations by @xcite show that in the 1 mbar to 10 bar pressure regime , which is the region of primary interest for observations , the temperature lies in the 10002000 k range . at these temperatures and pressures , chemical equilibrium considerations suggest that carbon on hd 209458b is sequestered primarily in carbon monoxide ( co ) and methane ( @xmath0 ) @xcite .",
    "these models show that co(g ) is the most stable carbon - bearing species at high temperatures and low pressures . at low temperatures and high pressures , @xmath0(g )",
    "is more stable thermodynamically .",
    "the oxygen not bound up in rock is present as either co(g ) or water vapor , @xmath13(g ) .    in planetary atmospheres",
    ", however , chemical equilibrium may not hold .",
    "there are several reasons for this .",
    "first , photochemical dissociation can elevate the concentrations of photochemical products above equilibrium levels @xcite .",
    "@xcite note that photochemical oxidation of @xmath0 is a well - known source of co in the earth s atmosphere .",
    "second , impacts by meteorites , comets , etc .",
    ", deposit metals and other compounds into the atmospheres of giant planets ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "third , chemical reactions may not always occur quickly enough relative to dynamical mixing for chemical equilibrium to be attained @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that the first effect ",
    "photochemical production  is unlikely to significantly alter the concentration of co in hd 209458b s stratosphere ( @xmath3 mbar ) .",
    "it is unknown how much impactors have modified the composition of hd 209458b s atmosphere during its evolution .",
    "we note , however , that calculations by @xcite show that co deposition by impactors can not explain the observed abundance of co ( @xmath14 ppb , as opposed to essentially zero in equilibrium ) in jupiter s lower troposphere . on jupiter ,",
    "rather , disequilibrium results from convective upwelling from deep regions ( @xmath15 bar ) , where the equilibrium abundance of co is higher . as the reaction rates plummet with decreasing temperature and pressure in ascending fluid parcels , the co concentration quenches to its observed value .",
    "photospheric pressures lie in the 10500 mbar range for all ir wavelengths @xcite . if large temperature variations of 5001000 k in this region are a reality on hd 209458b @xcite , it is conceivable that chemical quenching occurs in the horizontal rather than the vertical direction . in this hypothetical scenario ,",
    "fluid parcels attain chemical equilibrium on the planet s dayside , where the temperature is high and the reaction kinetics are fast .",
    "vigorous dynamical motions then carry these equilibrated parcels to the nightside , where they rapidly cool to temperatures where the reactions are too slow to equilibrate the system . depending on the meteorology and variations of the chemical rates with temperature and pressure , complex lateral co distributions could potentially result .",
    "for example , it would then be possible for co to be abundant at the evening limb but depleted at the morning limb .    to test the hypothesis that disequilibrium processes modify the abundances of co and @xmath0 in the observable atmosphere of hd209458b",
    ", we couple the reaction kinetics to a three - dimensional nonlinear model of the atmospheric dynamics .",
    "we show that at the temperatures and pressures relevant for observations of hd 209458b s atmosphere , the timescale for co/@xmath0 interconversion is everywhere long :  @xmath16 s. disequilibrium results in regions where the timescale for advection of co by dynamics , @xmath17 , is shorter than @xmath18 .",
    "due to uniformly large values of @xmath18 for @xmath3 bar , the simulations definitively show that quenching occurs in the vertical , not the horizontal .",
    "as on jupiter , we find that the concentration of co for @xmath3 bar depends on its value deeper in the atmosphere .",
    "vertical quenching and efficient horizontal mixing lead to a high - abundance , homogeneous distribution of co at the photosphere . as a result ,",
    "in cool regions ( e.g. , the nightside ) , the co concentration exceeds equilibrium values by many orders of magnitude .",
    "curiously , co was not detected on hd 209458b in a recent ground - based search using transmission spectroscopy at @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "several possible reasons for the co null detection have been noted by the authors and others .",
    "first , co may not be abundant in this planet s atmosphere , though this is only possible if the planet is significantly cooler ( by @xmath4 k ) than predicted by current radiative - equilibrium models @xcite .",
    "second , co may present in the visible atmosphere in some regions but depleted at the limb @xcite .",
    "third , the spectral signature of co at the planet s limb may be obscured either due to photochemical haze or a high - altitude silicate cloud @xcite .",
    "this explanation is favored by @xcite .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the co null detection reported by @xcite relies on the radiative - equilibrium calculations of @xcite .",
    "if unexpected opacity sources ( though not necessarily clouds ) play a strong role in the formation of spectral lines near @xmath20 , an upper limit to the co abundance can not be made with high confidence based on these observations .",
    "we note @xmath0 has not been seen on this planet either , despite attempts to detect its signature @xcite .",
    "we review in  [ section : equilibrium_considerations ] the theoretical reasons to expect co in high abundance in hd 209458b s atmosphere based on chemical equilibrium arguments .",
    "we discuss in  [ section : chemical_timescales ] the main chemical processes involved and derive the timescale for co/@xmath0 interconversion . in ",
    "[ section : model ] , we describe our coupling of chemistry to the atmospheric dynamics model of @xcite .",
    "we present the results of these simulations in  [ section : simulation_results ] . we explain and interpret these results in  [ section : analysis_interpretation ] , comparing our simulations to a simpler view of quenching presented by @xcite .",
    "we enumerate the major uncertainties in these calculations in  [ section : discussion ] . in ",
    "[ section : implications ] , we discuss implications of this work for near - future observations of hd 209458b and other close - in egps .",
    "prior discussions of chemistry on egps are based on chemical equilibrium models @xcite .",
    "solar abundances of the elements @xcite are generally assumed in these schemes , which perform global minimization of the gibbs free energy of the system , often including thermochemical data for hundreds of compounds .",
    "this minimization algorithm allows the concentrations of all chemicals to be solved for simultaneously . in such thermochemical calculations ,",
    "once the elemental abundances in the atmosphere have been specified , the abundances of all chemical species in the system depend solely on the local temperature and pressure ( allowing for simple ideas like rainout ) .",
    "simulations by @xcite suggest that the temperature at the photosphere of hd 209458b varies across the globe from @xmath211500 k. chemical equilibrium models show that at these temperatures , the atmosphere of this planet should contain appreciable quantities of co and @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite show that hd 209458b s atmosphere straddles the line of equal co/@xmath0 abundance , in the absence of disequilibrium effects .",
    "the relative concentrations of co and @xmath0 are strong functions of local temperature and pressure . at 1 bar ,",
    "where @xmath22 k , @xmath0 is the dominant carbon - bearing species ( in chemical equilibrium ) , while co is more abundant at this pressure for higher temperatures ( t >",
    "1150 k ) .    in the temperature and pressure ranges of interest for this investigation , calculation of the equilibrium abundances of co and @xmath0 is straightforward and reduces to several simple algebraic expressions .",
    "these expressions are used in our disequilibrium model , in which the mole fraction of co is relaxed to its value in chemical equilibrium ( see  [ subsection : model_co_chemistry ] ) .",
    "the expressions , as we will show , include the metallicity dependence directly .",
    "this allows us to explore the sensitivity of our disequilibrium calculations to the metallicity of hd 209458b s atmosphere , which is conceivably enhanced from that of the host star .",
    "such enhancement is seen on jupiter , where c , n , and probably o are several times more abundant relative to hydrogen than at the photosphere of the sun @xcite .",
    "we define @xmath23 to be the mole fraction of the i - th species in the system ; e.g. , @xmath24 is the mole fraction of molecular hydrogen .",
    "it is given by the ratio of the partial pressure of the i - th species to the total atmospheric pressure ( i.e. , @xmath25 ) .",
    "at the temperatures and pressures in this region of hd 209458b s atmosphere , hydrogen is primarily molecular @xmath26 [ j. fortney , private communication ] .",
    "we take @xmath27 for the @xmath26 mole fraction throughout this paper ( i.e. , we assume that @xmath26 dissociation is everywhere negligible ) .",
    "although oxygen is mostly in co and @xmath13 , some oxygen is also sequestered in rock , most of which forms deeper than 1 bar @xcite .",
    "we assume 16% of the atmospheric oxygen ( the maximum possible in a solar abundance mixture is in silicates . depending on where in the atmosphere @xmath28 condenses",
    ", this may underestimate ( by @xmath29% ) the oxygen available to affect co/@xmath0 chemistry in the region of interest .",
    "defining @xmath30 and @xmath31 as the mixing ratios of gaseous carbon and oxygen in the atmosphere , the mole fractions @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are related through mass balance : @xmath35 @xmath36 for solar metallicity .",
    "we see from equations [ equation : c1 ] and [ equation : c2 ] that water vapor will always be present in the system , even if 100% of the carbon is in co , since oxygen is more abundant than carbon .",
    "the third expression relating the quantities @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath37 derives from the equilibrium expression of the net thermochemical reaction @xmath38 the equilibrium expression for reaction [ reaction : co_ch4_h2o_equil ] , which we denote as @xmath39 , is @xmath40 = \\mathnormal{k}_{\\ref{reaction : co_ch4_h2o_equil},\\,\\rm eq}.\\ ] ]    in equation [ equation : co_ch4_h2o_equil ] , @xmath2 is atmospheric pressure [ bar ] , @xmath41 is the temperature [ k ] , and @xmath42 is the universal gas constant .",
    "the symbols @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 represent the _ gibbs free energies of formation _ of co , @xmath0 , and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the gibbs free energies of formation depend on temperature sensitively but only weakly on pressure .",
    "we simply use the values at standard pressure ( 1 bar ) , which are tabulated in the _ nist - janaf thermochemical tables _ @xcite . _ _ _ _    with the three equations [ equation : c1 ] , [ equation : c2 ] , and [ equation : co_ch4_h2o_equil ] , we can solve for the three equilibrium mole fractions @xmath32 , @xmath37 , and @xmath33 as a function of atmospheric pressure ( @xmath2 ) and temperature ( @xmath41 ) . defining @xmath46 , we solve for @xmath32 .",
    "we take the negative root of the quadratic equation , which represents the physical solution : @xmath47 with @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "the other concentrations are then easily solved for using the mass balance expressions ( equations [ equation : c1 ] and [ equation : c2 ] ) : @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the solution is valid for temperatures between 5002500 k over a broad range of pressures in the atmosphere .",
    "it is also valid for atmospheres with enhanced or depleted c and o abundances by simply tuning @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( so long as @xmath30 and @xmath31 are kept small : @xmath53 ) .",
    "we show in table [ table : co_fraction ] the ratio of co to total carbon in the atmosphere ( @xmath54 ) , assuming chemical equilibrium , for a variety of temperatures and pressures .",
    "the table shows that the co abundance  assuming equilibrium conditions  is a strong function of pressure and especially temperature .",
    "if large temperature variations in the atmosphere are indeed a reality on hd 209458b , as predicted both in radiative - equilibrium models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and simulations of the atmospheric dynamics @xcite , large gradients in the equilibrium concentrations of co and @xmath0 result .",
    "we now consider disequilibrium effects , which lead to vastly different conclusions about the relative concentrations of co and @xmath1 in the upper layers of this planet s atmosphere .",
    "co concentrations above equilibrium values have been discovered both on jupiter @xcite and on the brown dwarf gl 229b @xcite . @xcite and @xcite",
    "show that co disequilibrium in gl 229b results from the inefficiency of chemical reduction of co in regions of low temperature and pressure relative to the rate of vertical mixing .",
    "the co seen in the spectrum of gl 229b originates from deeper in the atmosphere , where co is abundant in chemical equilibrium .",
    "similarly , @xcite suggest that the co detected in the troposphere of jupiter was transported up by convection from deeper , hotter layers of the planet .",
    "@xcite explore several explanations for the unexpected 1 ppb co concentration observed on this planet .",
    "they conclude that convective mixing from deeper layers remains the most likely source of jupiter s tropospheric co , although the reactions suggested by @xcite are now thought to be too slow to explain the observed co abundance .",
    "we hypothesize that dynamics may drive the abundance of co on hd 209458b away from chemical equilibrium values . to ascertain the extent to which dynamics perturbs chemical equilibrium in this atmosphere",
    ", we first calculate the timescale for the processes converting co to @xmath0 and back .",
    "this depends on the chemical reactions involved .",
    "two independent reaction pathways for the chemical reduction of co have been considered in the literature .",
    "the following reaction was suggested by @xcite : @xmath55 this reaction is the rate - limiting step in a three - part sequence resulting in the chemical reduction of co to @xmath0 .",
    "these authors calculate a rate constant for reaction [ reaction : prinn ] of @xmath56    @xcite note that the other steps leading to the reduction of co to @xmath0 are fast relative to reaction [ reaction : prinn ] .",
    "they use equation [ equation : prinn_rate ] to estimate the chemical lifetime of co in disequilibrium as a function of temperature and pressure .    based on more recent measurements , however ,",
    "@xcite discuss that the reaction rate for reaction [ reaction : prinn ] is significantly slower than the rate assumed by @xcite : @xmath57    furthermore , as shown by @xcite , the convective timescale used by @xcite to derive the quench level is incorrect because it does not account for the gradient in both the lifetime and equilibrium abundance of co over an atmospheric scale height . using the updated reaction rate , equation [ equation : prinn_modified_rate ] , and the correct timescale for convective mixing ,",
    "@xcite find that the reaction sequence for co destruction suggested by @xcite can not explain the disequilibrium abundance of co in jupiter s troposphere .",
    "a faster reaction pathway for the reduction of co to @xmath0 must be sought .",
    "@xcite investigate an alternative three - step process involving the methoxy radical @xmath58 .",
    "they argue this pathway is more kinetically favorable because the strong carbonyl ( @xmath59 ) bond in @xmath60 is broken in a separate reaction step from the formation of the four c ",
    "h bonds in methane .",
    "@xcite propose the following three - stage reaction set : @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63    in this sequence , the first reaction , in which the @xmath59 bond is broken , is the rate - limiting step .",
    "the net reaction resulting from summing reactions [ reaction : yung1 ] , [ reaction : yung2 ] , and [ reaction : yung3 ] is @xmath64 we derive the number density of @xmath60 by assuming equilibrium with @xmath65 and co : @xmath66 , which is fast compared to reaction [ reaction : yung1 ] .",
    "we note also that the production of methane ( @xmath0 ) from @xmath67 occurs with nearly 100% efficiency @xcite .",
    "the rate of reaction [ reaction : yung1 ] has never been measured in the laboratory , but the rate of the reverse reaction is known @xcite : @xmath68 equation [ equation : yung1r_rate0 ] represents the low - pressure limit of the rate of the reverse of reaction [ reaction : yung1 ] in the temperature range relevant for this planet . for the high - pressure limit , we adopt equation ( 11 ) from @xcite : @xmath69 the net rate constant for the reverse reaction [ reaction : yung1],r can be expressed as @xmath70 where @xmath71 [ @xmath72 here is the number density of molecules in the atmosphere @xcite . it is related to pressure through the ideal gas equation of state .    using the proper eddy mixing timescale for chemical quenching derived by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite",
    "demonstrate that the kinetic rates derived from the @xcite reactions fit observations of co in disequilibrium on the brown dwarf gl 229b and on jupiter .",
    "as noted above , the reaction proposed by @xcite is too slow to account for the observed concentrations of co in these objects .",
    "we therefore follow @xcite and @xcite in this treatment and assume that the catalyzed @xcite reactions [ reaction : yung1][reaction : yung3 ] are the most efficient mechanism for the conversion of co to @xmath0 .    for the purpose of determining",
    "the co quench level on hd 209458b , we use the measured reaction rates ( eq .",
    "[ equation : yung1r_rate0 ]  [ equation : yung1r_rate ] ) along with thermochemical data to determine @xmath18 .",
    "this quantity , which is a strong function of both pressure and temperature , represents the timescale over which co can remain in disequilibrium @xcite .",
    "conservation of mass ( eq . [",
    "equation : c1 ] ) dictates that the rate of co destruction must equal the rate of @xmath0 production .",
    "so , @xmath18 also represents the timescale for conversion of @xmath0 back to co. this would not be so if other molecules competed effectively for the available carbon atoms . at these pressures and temperatures ,",
    "though , co and @xmath0 are the predominant carbon - bearing species ( see  [ section : equilibrium_considerations ] ) . hereafter , we simply refer to @xmath18 as the co/@xmath0 interconversion timescale .",
    "the co/@xmath0 interconversion timescale is given by @xcite : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the reaction rate of [ reaction : yung1 ] .",
    "an extra factor of @xmath71 arises in the denominator from writing the expression in terms of co , h , and @xmath60 mole fractions rather than concentrations .",
    "as has been noted , however , only the rate of the reverse of reaction [ reaction : yung1 ] has been measured .",
    "we therefore use the equilibrium constant of the chemical reaction @xmath75 to express @xmath18 in terms of equation [ equation : yung1r_rate ] .",
    "the equilibrium constant of reaction [ reaction : ch3o_equil ] is @xmath76.\\ ] ] the gibbs free energy of formation of @xmath58 can not be found in the janaf tables .",
    "we use values for @xmath77 from @xcite .    using these thermochemical data along with equation [ equation : yung1r_rate ]",
    ", we can express @xmath18 in a form that can be evaluated numerically : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "the first equality in equation [ equation : tau_chem2 ] is analogous to equation [ equation : tau_chem1 ] but for reaction [ reaction : yung1 ] in the _ reverse _ direction .",
    "all intermediate reactions in the system are assumed to be in equilibrium .",
    "the second equality results from substituting equation [ equation : k_ch3o ] in for the ratio @xmath80 . _ _    we show values for @xmath18 in table [ table : tau_chem ] at the same pressures and temperatures chosen in table [ table : co_fraction ] .",
    "table [ table : tau_chem ] demonstrates that for @xmath3 bar , @xmath81 for all @xmath82 , which is an upper limit to the temperature at hd 209458b s photosphere .",
    "this result immediately rules out horizontal quenching as an important disequilibrium process at the photosphere .",
    "the timescale for horizontal mixing @xmath83 , so that @xmath84 on both the day and night sides of the planet .",
    "deeper down ( @xmath85 bar ) , co/@xmath0 interconversion is fast ( @xmath86 s ) . at this pressure ,",
    "the chemical interconversion timescale is less than both the horizontal and vertical mixing times .",
    "we would therefore expect chemical equilibrium of co/@xmath0 to hold in the atmosphere at @xmath87 bar .",
    "the top of this region ( @xmath88 bar ) is the approximate `` quench level . '' note that the precise altitude of quenching also depends on atmospheric temperature and wind speeds , which are themselves highly variable @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the quench level is not an exact isobar .",
    "referencing table [ table : co_fraction ] , we see that abundant co at the photosphere of this planet is likely because vertical transport processes are probably efficient @xcite , and the chemical equilibrium co concentration at the quench level is likely to be quite high .",
    "we now discuss a coupled atmospheric dynamics and disequilibrium co/@xmath0 chemistry model to predict co concentrations for a variety of atmospheric conditions .",
    "our simulation results ( see  [ section : simulation_results ] ) verify the general validity of these considerations .",
    "we adapt the model of @xcite to include simple carbon chemistry based on the discussions in  [ section : equilibrium_considerations ] and  [ section : chemical_timescales ] .",
    "our model employs the aries / geos dynamical core , version 2 ( agdc2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the agdc2 solves the primitive equations of dynamical meteorology , which are the foundation of numerous climate and numerical weather prediction models @xcite .",
    "the primitive equations are a simplification of the full navier - stokes equations of fluid mechanics , which assume hydrostatic balance of each vertical column of atmosphere .",
    "this is equivalent to assuming that the vertical acceleration is negligible compared to the buoyancy .",
    "the approximation holds in stably stratified regions for `` shallow '' flow , in which the vertical depth is much smaller than the horizontal extent ( * ? ? ?",
    "heavy irradiation from the star extends the radiative zone of this planet down to @xmath89 kbar .",
    "this is @xmath901/10 of the radius @xcite , leading to a horizontal to vertical aspect ratio of about 10:1 .",
    "the agdc2 is a finite - difference model , which discretizes the dynamical variables onto a staggered latitude - longitude c - grid @xcite .",
    "the agdc2 consists of a set of subroutines that compute the time tendencies of the prognostic variables , including the zonal and meridional winds , potential temperature @xcite , surface pressure , and an arbitrary number of passive tracers . at each time step",
    ", the agdc2 simply updates the time tendencies to include the effects of the dynamics .",
    "all physical tendencies ( e.g. , chemistry , radiation , etc . ) , as well as temporal and spatial filtering needed to control computational instabilities , are performed outside of the agdc2 .",
    "it is not possible in general to find numerically stable solutions to the primitive equations without viscosity @xcite .",
    "the standard approach , which we adopt here , is to add diffusive terms to the momentum , energy conservation , and tracers equations .",
    "we have experimented with the diffusion parameters , espousing the philosophy of @xcite to use as weak hyperdiffusion as possible consistent with numerically stable solutions . for the simulations discussed here , we use @xmath91-order hyperdiffusion , with coefficients set to damp grid - scale instabilities over a timescale of @xmath92 .    for all simulations ,",
    "we take the `` top '' layer of the model to be at 1 mbar .",
    "although a proper model of the upper atmosphere would require the model top be placed at a lower pressure , we generally ignore the upper atmosphere in this work .",
    "modeling the high atmosphere would require a proper treatment of stratospheric photochemistry and the possible effects of non - local thermodynamic equilibrium in the radiation field at sub - millibar pressures @xcite .",
    "the atmosphere spans @xmath93 pressure scale heights between our input top pressure ( 1 mb ) and the planet s radiative - convective boundary ( 1 kbar ) . by comparison ,",
    "the pressure in the earth s atmosphere spans only 23 pressure scale heights from the surface to the tropopause .",
    "we use 40 layers evenly spaced in log pressure .",
    "we assume in this treatment that synchronous rotation holds in the convective interior .",
    "the consequences of this assumption are twofold : ( 1 ) the rotational period is fixed to the 3.5 day orbital period ( leading to a moderately strong coriolis force ) , and ( 2 ) heating by the star occurs on one hemisphere of the planet continually .",
    "this assumption is valid for many hot jupiters ( such as hd 209458b ) , which experience rapid tidal circularization of their orbits @xcite .",
    "atmospheric tides may cause the orbit to be slightly asynchronous , as noted by @xcite .",
    "but large deviations from synchronous rotation are unlikely on hd 209458b without the presence of another ( thus far unseen ) planet @xcite .",
    "we discuss in  [ subsection : radiation ] that the asynchronous component ( a factor of 2 in the extreme case , though more likely in the 1020% range ) will not greatly affect the outcome of our predictions for @xmath94 chemistry ( see  [ section : discussion ] ) .",
    "but it would be interesting in future studies to explore the dynamics of hot jupiters under the alternate assumption of variable heating due to non - zero eccentricity , large obliquity , or strong thermal tides .",
    "we follow @xcite for the scalar input parameters , ignoring small variations in the gravitational acceleration , heat capacity , and mean molecular weight in the atmosphere .",
    "we set these values to constants : g = @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 .",
    "the values of these constants have been chosen to be intermediate between the values they would have at 1 mbar and 3 kbar because @xmath26 dissociation is expected to occur in the deepest layers of the model .",
    "for the chemistry , we assume hydrogen is molecular everywhere , which holds in the upper layers of interest here ( see  [ section : chemical_timescales ] ) .",

    "hence , the stellar radiation will not penetrate as deeply near the limb but will be absorbed higher up in the atmosphere .",

    "this profile is 300 k cooler at every pressure level than the profile used for the nominal model : @xmath137 . for the cold case ,",

    "figure [ figure : t_winds_nominal ] spans about 5 scale heights in pressure , encompassing the region crucial for observations of close - in egps . despite adjustments to the cooling scheme ( see  [ subsection : limb_effects ] ) , the temperatures , wind speeds , and flow geometry of the nominal model are broadly consistent with simulations published by @xcite .",
    "strong temperature contrasts on isobars are evident in the simulation for all three layers shown . as seen in panel ( a ) of figure [ figure : t_winds_nominal ] , the atmosphere is nearly in radiative equilibrium at low pressures , where the radiative time constants are less than a day . at higher pressures , panels ( b ) and ( c ) , the radiative heating is weaker and large departures from radiative equilibrium can be seen .",
    "a strong superrotating jet extending from the equator to the mid - latitudes develops in the flow . in the middle panel ,",
    "( b ) , the hottest regions of the atmosphere are blown downstream from the substellar point @xmath149 by about @xmath150 .",
    "this layer at 106 mbar is near the planet s photosphere .",
    "longitudinal temperature contrasts are apparent near 1 bar , as shown in panel ( c ) , where the hot region of the atmosphere is shifted downwind from the substellar point by a full @xmath131 .",
    "many features of the flow in the cold model ( not shown ) are quite similar to the nominal model , though the temperatures in this atmosphere are on corresponding isobars are notably cooler ( by @xmath151 ) . from a dynamics standpoint ,",
    "the models are basically the same , with similar flow patterns and wind velocities developing in each case .",
    "the temperature differences between the nominal and cold models are important for determining the carbon chemistry , however , since the reaction kinetics depend sensitively on temperature ( see  [ section : chemical_timescales ] ) .",
    "our result for the distribution of gaseous carbon in hd 209458b s atmosphere is shown in figure [ figure : tracers_nominal ] .",
    "contrast this with figure [ figure : tr_equil_nominal ] , which shows how carbon would be distributed under ( fictitious ) chemical equilibrium conditions .",
    "grayscale in these figures represents the percentage of total atmospheric carbon present as co.    as shown in panels ( a ) and ( b ) of figure [ figure : tr_equil_nominal ] , the assumption of chemical equilibrium implies that vast regions of hd 209458b s atmosphere are devoid of co. in these cool regions , @xmath0 is strongly favored thermodynamically .",
    "steep gradients in the concentration of co are possible wherever the temperature varies rapidly about the line of equal @xmath152 abundance ( refer to figure 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "by contrast , panel ( c ) shows that near the 1 bar level in the atmosphere , co is the more thermodynamically stable compound .",
    "this is because near 1 bar , as shown in figure [ figure : t_winds_nominal ] , the temperature is everywhere higher than 1200 k , which is where the equilibrium abundances of co and @xmath0 are equal ( at this pressure ) .",
    "our model s result , which considers the extremely slow rate of @xmath94 interconversion in this region of the planet s atmosphere , shows a completely different view of the carbon chemistry .",
    "the simulation predicts a nearly homogeneous distribution of co in all three layers shown .",
    "co permeates the atmosphere in this region , being by far the dominant carbon - bearing species ( at the 98 - 99% level ) .",
    "our result for the cold model is similar to the nominal case .",
    "the cold atmosphere simulation also predicts that carbon is homogenized in the upper atmosphere . as in the nominal case ,",
    "carbon is the major carbon - bearing gas in the 101000 mbar range . here",
    ", though , 20% of the carbon is @xmath0 ( as opposed to 12% in the nominal simulation ) .",
    "the figure reveals that co is likely to be highly abundant near the photospheres of egps  both on the dayside and nightside  even on planets like tres-1 that are significantly cooler than hd 209458b .",
    "we have also run a `` hot model , '' in which 300 k was added to the radiative - equilibrium profile of the nominal model : @xmath153 .",
    "the circulation pattern seen for the nominal and cold models ( figure [ figure : t_winds_nominal ] ) develops for the hot model as well , though the temperatures on each corresponding layer are higher by @xmath154300 k. the temperature is high enough in the hot model for co to be present in high abundance everywhere in both the equilibrium and disequilibrium pictures .",
    "therefore , planets significantly warmer than hd 209458b should contain no @xmath1 at all near their photospheres .",
    "steady - state has been reached for @xmath155 bar .",
    "but the kinetic energy of the deeper layers in the model still increases with time after 1000 days .",
    "large equator - to - pole temperature variations are seen in the bottom three panels ( spanning the 310 bar range ) .",
    "wind speeds remain high at these pressures .",
    "although heating has been turned off for pressures exceeding 10 bar , the atmosphere is not motionless even at 30 bar .",
    "we attribute this to vertical transport processes that transfer kinetic energy and angular momentum to the @xmath156 region @xcite .",
    "the vertical wind in the model is quite strong ( @xmath157 = 0.050.1@xmath158 at 3 bar ) .",
    "the vertical wind shows evidence of both small - scale ( @xmath159 ) and large - scale ( @xmath160 ) structure , with alternating regions of upwelling and downwelling .",
    "the small - scale features are likely the result of atmospheric waves .",
    "the large - scale structures correspond to overturning circulations superimposed on the fast superrotation , although we emphasize the region is not convective ( vertical motion on this planet is physically much more similar to stratospheric overturning in the earth s atmosphere ) .",
    "upwelling occurs primarily within @xmath161 of the equator , whereas prominent downwelling occurs in the mid - latitudes . in the 11000 mbar region",
    ", there is also a longitudinal dependence of the vertical wind . in these upper layers of the model ,",
    "strong upwelling occurs in hot regions ( which is downstream of the substellar point at 1 bar ) , whereas downwelling occurs in cool regions .",
    "this longitudinal structure is present but much weaker in the 110 bar region .",
    "ultimately , the high co concentrations we see in these simulations are the result of chemical quenching . in general",
    ", the distribution of carbon - bearing species will depend on ( 1 ) where in the atmosphere quenching occurs ( the `` quench level '' ) , and ( 2 ) the chemical equilibrium abundances of co and @xmath1 at the quench level .",
    "the strong vertical wind is capable of transporting parcels through a pressure scale height ( @xmath162 500 km ) in @xmath163 , which is comparable to the timescale for horizontal advection of parcels across a hemisphere .",
    "this supports the notion that quenching occurs primarily in the vertical , not the horizontal , due to uniformly long chemical timescales in the region of disequilibrium ( see  [ section : chemical_timescales ] ) .",
    "the quench level of this model  which demarcates the region where the equilibrium and disequilibrium views give the same answer  is in the @xmath2 = 35 bar range .",
    "this is of course not exact because quenching depends on temperature , and considerable equator - to - pole temperature variations exist at depth in these models @xcite .",
    "for example , comparison of the bottom panels of figures [ figure : tr_equil_nominal ] and [ figure : tracers_nominal ] reveals that at the equator , quenching likely occurs closer to @xmath164 bar .",
    "but at higher latitudes , where the temperature is lower on these layers , the quench level is deeper ( @xmath165 bar ) .",
    "the cause of such high co abundances from 10100 mbar becomes clear .",
    "the value of @xmath32 in equilibrium is quite high in the region of quenching .",
    "it is in fact generally higher near 3 bar than it is in deeper layers ( not shown ) .",
    "this is due to the thermodynamic stability of @xmath0 at high pressures , as shown in table [ table : co_fraction ] .",
    "the results clearly indicate , though , that the quench level ( not deeper layers ) determines the photospheric value .",
    "this is due to vertical transport .",
    "the strongest vertical wind is near the equator , where the temperature is also the highest ( on a given vertical layer ) .",
    "it is for this reason that the disequilibrium values of co in the 11000 mbar region are so uniformly high : vertical mixing is maximum at the equator at the quench level , where temperature and pressure conditions strongly favor the formation of co.    we now investigate a simpler view of quenching , which yields very similar results to the numerical simulations .       and",

    "unless the photochemical production of radicals dominates the chemistry , the disequilibrium distributions will be substantially similar to those presented here .",
    "asynchronous rotation on hot jupiters is possible , either due to eccentricity / obliquity pumping by other planets in the system or thermal tides @xcite . in the case of hd 209458b ,",
    "we expect synchronous rotation to hold more closely than planets in eccentric orbits .",
    "an asynchronous component to the rotation , due to thermal tides and transfer of angular momentum from the atmosphere to the interior , could conceivably influence the atmospheric dynamics solution ( figure [ figure : t_winds_nominal ] ) .",
    "for example , our time - steady flow scenario might be superposed in some regions by a slow periodicity resulting from a radiative heating profile that slowly advances along the meridians . but as we discuss in  [ section : analysis_interpretation ] , quenching is in the vertical .",
    "adding asynchronous rotation to the model might change the details of the wind and temperature patterns but not the mean vertical velocity .",
    "hence , the @xmath94 distributions should not be sensitive to this correction .",
    "newtonian heating ignores potentially subtle feedbacks in the radiation physics .",
    "it has been used successfully , however , to model essential features of earth s general circulation @xcite .",
    "we note that the approximation is likely to be less valid deep in the atmosphere of egps than it is for earth .",
    "this is due to long radiative time constants and huge departures from radiative equilibrium .",
    "hence , the use of newtonian heating is probably the major source of error in our atmosphere model .",
    "we use it here partly because the approximation is reasonably valid for @xmath197 bar , where @xmath112 is less than several days .",
    "the scheme is also relatively easy to implement and performs well computationally , which is very desirable , as the agdc2 itself demands considerable computational resources .",
    "we are able , therefore , to test the sensitivity of the results to a broad set of input parameters .",
    "we note also that the abundances of @xmath13 , co , and @xmath0used by @xcite to derive the contributions of these molecules to the total opacity  are calculated based on chemical equilibrium models .",
    "we demonstrate here , however , that chemical equilibrium does _ not _ hold for @xmath198 bars .",
    "this internal inconsistency is inherent in our use of newtonian cooling and is unfortunately unavoidable .",
    "radiative - equilibrium models of hd 209458b s atmosphere to date have all assumed chemical equilibrium . even in the future",
    ", this coupling between dynamics and radiation will be difficult to disentangle because , as has been previously discussed , disequilibrium abundances depend on the overall meteorology .",
    "@xcite also do not consider clouds .",
    "where present , high silicate clouds could dominate the opacity and greatly perturb the atmospheric profile .",
    "cloud deck optical thickness in general varies with wavelength , depending on the vertical extent of the cloud and the condensate particle sizes @xcite .",
    "it is unclear what properties a silicate cloud high in the atmosphere would have .",
    "this is a complicated subject involving intricate feedbacks between radiation , cloud microphysics , and dynamics .",
    "we neglect the possibly crucial effects of clouds here .",
    "including condensation processes will be a major future advance in the field of egp atmosphere modeling .      given the large @xmath18 values at low pressures , it is reasonable to wonder whether our solutions for the co distribution depend on the initial conditions .",
    "for the simulations shown , we have assumed that co is initially in chemical equilibrium everywhere ( equation [ equation : x_co ] ) . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "temperatures and winds are not strongly sensitive to the initial conditions .",
    "the primary concern here is whether vertical transport can mix co upward rapidly enough to bring the co mole fraction at the photosphere up to its value at the quench level .",
    "clearly , chemical processes occurring on timescales longer than @xmath14 year can not have run to completion by 1000 days of integration time .",
    "but we can argue on simple grounds that 1000 days is still long enough to determine @xmath32 , even where @xmath199 year .",
    "assuming the vertical wind at 1 bar is @xmath200 , as shown by the model , and the vertical depth from the photosphere ( 100 mbar ) to the quench level ( 3 bar ) is @xmath142% of the planetary radius ( several scale heights ) , we would expect upward mixing to occur on timescales of @xmath14 week .",
    "thus , after @xmath21 days of integration time , the co concentration should approach the value at the quench level .",
    "we have run two additional simulations with different initial conditions .",
    "the first simulation assumes no initial co in the atmosphere ; i.e. , 100% of the carbon is @xmath0 .",
    "the second simulation assumes no initial @xmath0 ; i.e. , 100% of the carbon is co. both use the input parameters of the nominal model in all other respects .",
    "therefore , temperatures and winds are the same as in the nominal case .",
    "after even several hundred days of simulation time , the solutions for co in these two cases are virtually indistinguishable from the nominal simulation ( see figure [ figure : tracers_nominal ] ) .",
    "these tests demonstrate that memory of the initial condition for @xmath32 has been erased by @xmath201 days .",
    "our nominal simulation assumes solar abundances based on the @xcite compilation .",
    "we note that the precise values of the solar abundances , especially c , n , and o , have undergone minor modifications in the past seven years , some of which are still under discussion within the scientific community @xcite . in particular , the cno abundances , along with those of the noble gases , have been revised down from the geochemically based abundances of @xcite .",
    "the c / o ratio is now thought to be exactly 0.5 ; following @xcite , we use c / o = 0.57 here . incorporating these updates to the solar abundances will modify the results presented here somewhat , though the correction is likely to be fairly minor .    from stellar spectroscopy ,",
    "the endowment of heavy elements in the star hd 209458 is well - known to be about solar : @xmath202 = 0.014 \\pm 0.03 $ ] @xcite .",
    "that says nothing about the metallicity of the planet orbiting it , which has not yet been measured .",
    "jupiter and saturn boast pronounced enrichments in heavy elements relative to the sun , suggesting egps may also be metal - rich compared to their host stars .",
    "we consider here the effects of increasing the relative proportions of carbon and oxygen in hd 209458b s atmosphere .",
    "suppose the constants @xmath30 and @xmath31 in equations [ equation : c1 ] and [ equation : c2 ] are both increased by a factor of 10 .",
    "this is a much greater metal abundance than is seen on jupiter , which has enrichment of carbon and nitrogen by a factor of @xmath113 relative to the sun ( from galileo probe measurements ; the probe was not successful in measuring the abundance of oxygen ",
    "see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as carbon and oxygen in this case",
    "are still minor constituents , this change will not appreciably affect the mean molecular weight or heat capacity of the atmosphere . according to our chemical equilibrium solution , equation [ equation : x_co ] ,",
    "increased [ fe / h ] favors the formation of co. that is , for a given temperature and pressure , the ratio @xmath203 is _ higher _ for [ fe / h ] = + 1.0 than it is at [ fe / h ] = 0.0 , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "this implies that , relative to the solar metallicity case , the quench level should have a greater abundance of co in the [ fe / h ] = + 1.0 atmosphere by _ more _ than a factor of 10 .",
    "hence , we would also expect the photosphere to show highly abundant co.    we have run a high - metallicity simulation , in which we set [ fe / h ] = 1.0 in the atmosphere .",
    "the other parameters of this model are identical to the nominal simulation , so the dynamics are the same .",
    "we indeed see in this simulation that 100% of the carbon atoms are in co , with no @xmath0 at all ( as opposed to 12% @xmath0 predicted in the nominal case ) .",
    "we stress that the above discussion assumes atmospheric temperatures do not change drastically as a result of increasing the metallicity .",
    "this assumption may not be correct for all egps .",
    "we note , however , that @xcite consider metallicity adjustments to their radiative - equilibrium models of hd 209458b and tres-1 .",
    "they find that the effective temperature of tres-1 increases by only @xmath204 for a metallicity of @xmath205 solar .",
    "the direction of the effect ",
    "warming , not cooling  also favors the appearance of co.    similarly , increasing the c / o ratio in the atmosphere will not inhibit co s formation at the temperature of hd 209458b s atmosphere . in the sun ,",
    "@xmath206 . if @xmath207 , co can potentially take up 100% of the available oxygen , in which case @xmath13 will be depleted .",
    "atmospheres showing the spectral signatures of co without prominent @xmath13 features very likely have a high c / o ratio relative to solar .",
    "the effects of super - solar abundances and enhanced c / o are discussed in more detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we have run 3d numerical simulations of hd 2094548b s atmosphere to explore the chemistry of carbon .",
    "we advect co through the atmosphere as a passive tracer , relaxing its concentration toward the local chemical equilibrium value .",
    "the relaxation timescale depends on the reaction pathways that convert co to @xmath0 .",
    "we follow recent previous work on disequilibrium carbon chemistry @xcite and assume that the @xcite sequence is the most efficient mechanism for the chemical reduction of co.    we calculate the relative abundances of co , @xmath0 , and @xmath13 , which are the main species of carbon and oxygen in the atmosphere .",
    "our nominal simulation models hd 209458b specifically . for comparison",
    ", we have also run simulations of `` cold '' and `` hot '' atmospheres .",
    "the cold simulation is representative of a planet that is @xmath208 k cooler than hd 209458b ; the hot simulation models a planet @xmath208 k warmer .",
    "the atmospheric dynamics by 1000 earth days of simulation time has reached the steady state described in @xcite . eastward winds in the nominal model reach @xmath209 at the photosphere , with corresponding temperature contrasts of @xmath210 .",
    "atmospheric dynamics partially redistribute the thermal energy to the planet s nightside , but longitudinal contrasts in temperature are apparent down to @xmath142 bars .",
    "chemical equilibrium has been the basis of all prior discussions about co and @xmath0 on hd 209458b .",
    "we show here , though , that the equilibrium picture of @xmath94 chemistry is a vast misconception . in regions where chemical equilibrium does not hold ,",
    "the true co abundance depends not only on local quantities but also on the overall meteorology .",
    "we show that the timescale for @xmath94 interconversion depends sensitively on both temperature and pressure ( table [ table : tau_chem ] ) . at low temperatures and pressures ,",
    "reactions are slow ; at high temperatures and pressures , reactions are fast . as a result of long reaction times",
    ", co is not expected to be in chemical equilibrium in the 11000 mbar region ( the `` visible '' layers ) .",
    "chemical equilibrium in the model atmosphere is attained deeper in the atmosphere ( @xmath211 bars ) , where the interconversion timescale is short relative to dynamical mixing times .",
    "the atmosphere is well - mixed by vertical motions , which leads to vertical ( as opposed to horizontal ) quenching .",
    "vertical quenching results in photospheric co concentrations exceeding chemical equilibrium values by many orders of magnitude .",
    "the simulations show that co , @xmath0 , and @xmath13 will be homogeneously distributed throughout the photosphere of hd 209458b and similar planets . at @xmath212 bars ,",
    "almost all of the carbon is in the form of co , even in cold regions such as the nightside .",
    "consequently , we expect water vapor to be less plentiful than previously thought .",
    "these conclusions are consistent with the simpler view of quenching presented by @xcite .",
    "the metallicity of hd 209458b is not known .",
    "our nominal simulation assumes solar abundances .",
    "we have also run a variation on the nominal model that assumes ten times enhancement of the heavy elements : [ fe / h ] = + 1.0 .",
    "disequilibrium effects operate similarly in this model , and the ratio of co to total carbon in the atmosphere remains close to 100% .",
    "indeed , higher metallicity favors the formation of co over @xmath0 .",
    "hence , if close - in egps have characteristically super - solar abundances , co could be prominent at the photospheres of planets even cooler than @xmath213 .    likewise",
    ", increasing the c / o ratio would not significantly inhibit co s formation at depth ( and subsequent transport up to the photosphere ) . if c / o exceeds the solar value of 0.5 in the sun , co on hd 209458b should be highly abundant .",
    "the tell - tale sign of this scenario at hd 209458b s effective temperature is @xmath13 depletion .",
    "our results have several interesting consequences for near - future observations of close - in egps , although a thorough analysis of close - in egp spectra is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "we conclude simply with a brief description of the implications of these findings .",
    "the hot model shows that planets significantly warmer than hd 209458b should have _ no _ @xmath0 in their photospheres , unless the c / o ratio is greater than 1 .",
    "but in planets significantly cooler than hd 209458b , disequilibrium effects should raise the concentration of co to detectable levels .",
    "the specific value of @xmath32 can not be predicted with definite precision based on these simulations ; there are too many uncertainties in the model s inputs .",
    "however , examination of the values of @xmath18 ( table [ table : tau_chem ] ) suggests that 110 bar may be the approximate quench level for _ all _ close - in egps within @xmath214 of hd 209458b s effective temperature ( @xmath215 k for this planet ) .",
    "the relative concentrations of co and @xmath0 at the photosphere are therefore diagnostic of local conditions in the 110 bar region of the atmosphere , which is deeper than observations can directly probe .",
    "neither species has yet been detected in this planet s atmosphere @xcite .",
    "our results here suggest that @xmath0 depletion ( not depletion of co ) is the more likely situation ; even in chemical equilibrium , @xmath0 is likely to be depleted at the limb .",
    "measurements of carbon - bearing species can thus serve as a useful calibration tool of radiation and dynamics models of these planets .",
    "it should be noted that metallicity also plays a role in determining the abundance of co at the quench level .",
    "this may be a difficult effect to deconvolve from temperature and pressure , unless absolute concentrations can be measured . for near - future explorations ,",
    "what is crucial here is that planets with little or no @xmath1 must be very much warmer than tres-1 or else cooler , but very metal - rich ( as high metallicity favors the formation of co over @xmath0 ) .",
    "it is known that hd 209458b does contain carbon and oxygen @xcite . as @xcite",
    "discuss , the null detection of co using nirspec on keck ii can not be easily attributed to co depletion in hd 209458b s atmosphere .",
    "this lends credence to the hypothesis of a high cloud or haze obscuring the spectral features of co near 2 @xmath216 . as discussed by @xcite",
    ", however , the slant geometry implies that even a layer of modest optical thickness could hide the signature of co. it may be possible to distinguish between these and other scenarios .",
    "our results suggest that tres-1 , which orbits a k - type star , should also show strong co absorption features in its spectrum . a high silicate condensation cloud obscuring the photosphere",
    "is not expected on tres-1 due to lower temperatures overall .",
    "the condensation of silicates should occur at much greater depth in tres-1 s atmosphere .",
    "it would be very illuminating to perform a transmission spectroscopy search for co on tres-1 .",
    "discovery of co on tres-1 would make a strong case for high silicate clouds in the atmosphere of hd 209458b . if co is also not detectable on tres-1 by transmission spectroscopy , on the other hand , the hypothesis of stratospheric haze ( that hides co on both planets ) becomes more appealing .",
    "the ubiquitousness of co throughout the photospheres of close - in egps should also have profound implications for the spectra of these objects .",
    "our results for the cold model suggest that co may even be abundant on cooler egps than tres-1 .",
    "if so , co s spectral signature should be detectable .",
    "the absorption features of @xmath13 may also be less pronounced , especially on hot planets , in which over half of the available oxygen atoms are bound up in co. in addition to the 2 @xmath216 band pass explored by @xcite , we suggest searches for co in the rovibrational fundamental near 4.5 @xmath217 . if present , the opacity of co overwhelms that of @xmath13 vapor at this wavelength , even more so than the wavelength region explored in @xcite . as an ir window also exists at 4.5 @xmath216 , this observation may also be possible using ground - based platforms .",
    "it is noteworthy also that these simulations predict a homogeneous distribution of co , @xmath0 , and @xmath13 in hd 209458b s atmosphere , although the temperature is almost certainly not isothermal at the photosphere .",
    "@xcite show that temperature variations over the photosphere can lead to brightness variations in the planet with orbital phase .",
    "it must be emphasized that the synthetic light curve of @xcite pertained to the _ bolometric _ luminosity of the planet ( i.e. , the emission integrated over all wavelengths ) ; nothing is directly implied about the planet s brightness at a particular wavelength .",
    "the flux contrast of the planet s photosphere over a full orbital period would likely be suppressed somewhat by a homogeneous distribution of co and @xmath1 , as the distribution of these species determines the level of the photosphere [ j. fortney , private communication ] .",
    "wavelength - dependent light curves will require generating synthetic spectra using a radiative transfer model , a task we leave for future work .",
    "but we hope this discussion will inspire near - future searches for co and @xmath0 on these planets , some of which should be possible even with ground - based telescopes .",
