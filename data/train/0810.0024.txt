    "the gas is still settling into rotational support and has probably fallen to somewhat smaller radius initially than expected for centrifugal equilibrium and will take some time to reach centrifugal equilibrium .      probing",
    "the collapse of gas at the centre of dark matter haloes in a cosmological context is an extremely challenging exercise when we wish to follow the collapse to very high densities . in this work",
    "we have reached radii as small as 0.01% of the virial radius while at the same time following the dynamical evolution of a substantial fraction of the gas in the halo .",
    "this presents a considerable challenge even for an amr code like enzo .",
    "the main problem is that the high refinement levels necessary to achieve such a large dynamic range mean that the code will normally grind to a halt following the dynamical evolution of whatever is the first high density region to form . as discussed , in order to ameliorate this problem",
    "we have changed the refinement level during the simulation in order to allow our three haloes of choice to build up to their full mass . to what level",
    "may this have affected our results ? + in order to address this we have run simulations with twice the initial refinement level and sixty four times the initial refinement level and found no systematic difference in the initial value of the angular momentum of the halo . while the detailed dynamical evolution is obviously different especially in the later stages of the collapse when the initial distribution of matter in the halo is different the qualitative behavior of the dynamical evolution did not change .",
    "we would also like to point out that our results are in most aspects similar to those of w07 who did not change the refinement level during the simulation .",
    "this meant , however , that they were not able to follow the gas at the centre of the halo settling into rotational support .",
    "we feel that this is the most interesting aspect of our work and well worth exploring the limits of the code with some manual intervention .",
    "obviously further work is needed to address these questions in more detail .",
    "we have investigated the dynamical evolution of the gas in haloes with virial temperatures of between @xmath107 k and @xmath66 k assuming that cooling by atomic hydrogen and helium are the dominant cooling processes .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the gas in the haloes is complex and highly turbulent with turbulent velocities approaching the virial velocity of the haloes .",
    "the gas in the inner part of our haloes collapses isothermally with a temperature of 6000 - 7000k on a somewhat slower time scale than the free - fall time and settles into a close to isothermal ( @xmath108 ) density profile .",
    "we find no signs of efficient fragmentation confirming suggestions that the isothermal collapse of gas in a dark matter halo at temperatures close to the virial temperature of the halo leads to only modest fragmentation .",
    "the inner 0.1 - 1 % of the gas in the virialised haloes loses as much as 95% of its initial angular momentum during the collapse .",
    "the gas thereby collapses by a factor of 300 - 1000 in radius and eventually settles into a very compact rotationally supported self - gravitating disc with peak rotation velocities of 25 - 60 @xmath106 and `` radii '' of 0.3 pc - 0.6 pc ( 0.05% - 0.1% of the virial radius of the host halo ) .",
    "+ the discs have an exponential surface mass density profile with scale length in the range @xmath109 pc which extends over several scale lengths .",
    "the vertical structure of the disc is somewhat more extended than expected for a purely pressure supported isothermal axisymmetric exponential disc . + massive compact self - gravitating discs such as those found in our simulations",
    "have been suggested to evolve into massive seed black holes which later in the hierarchical build - up of galaxies will grow into the supermassive black holes found at the centre of the bulges of present - day galaxies .",
    "unfortunately we were not yet able to follow the further dynamical evolution of the discs or the gas further out in the haloes in our simulations .",
    "however , independent of whether the gas in these discs will continue to efficiently lose angular momentum and contract further or will fragment and form an ultra - compact star cluster we most probably have identified an important intermediary stage en route to the formation of a massive seed black hole .",
    "the simulations were run on the cosmos  ( sgi altix 3700 ) supercomputer at damtp in cambridge and on the cambridge high performance computing cluster darwin  in cambridge .",
    "cosmos  is a uk - ccc facility which is supported by hefce and pparc .",
    "darwin  is the primary supercomputer of the university of cambridge high performance computing service ( http://www.hpc.cam.ac.uk/ ) , provided by dell inc . using strategic research infrastructure funding from the higher education funding council for england .",
