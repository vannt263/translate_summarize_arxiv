    "it is well known that non - classical state of electromagnetic field like squeezed state can be generated from vacuum in a non - stationary cavity with oscillating wall .",
    "this phenomenon of photon generation from vacuum state by non - adiabatic change in the boundary condition of quantum fields is termed as dynamical casimir effect ( dce ) .",
    "several theoretical studies devoted to the generation of photons in a cavity with vibrating wall resulting into harmonic modulation of the mode frequency have been reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "we also refer to refs . @xcite and @xcite for review on various aspects of dce . it has been shown that for an ideal cavity ( without cavity dissipation ) maximum number of photons are created when the modulation frequency is twice that of unperturbed cavity mode frequency .",

    "dce lies in realizing vibrating cavity with frequency of the order of few ghz .",

    "workers have carried out series of studies on the interaction of various model atoms with the field in a cavity with harmonically modulated mode frequency @xcite .",
    "interaction of a single two - level atom with quantized electromagnetic field inside a cavity with time dependent parameters has also been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . keeping these difficulties in mind recently two proposals for experimental generation and detection of photons in non - stationary cavities",

    "@xcite authors proposed that cavities with mechanical vibration in the ghz range may be obtained through a film bulk acoustic resonator ( fbar ) @xcite made of vibrating aluminium nitride film of thickness equal to half of the acoustic wavelength . for detection of photons generated in the cavity these authors proposed to use ultra - cold alkali atoms in their hyperfine states . on the other hand , ref .",
    "@xcite explored the possibility of using a cavity with plasma mirror made from semiconductor slab irradiated by periodic laser pulses for generation of photons from vacuum state and rydberg atoms with large values of principal quantum number for detection of these photons .",
    "one of the hallmarks of the photon generated in the non - stationary cavity is the presence of two - photon correlation as they are generated via two - photon process .",
    "it is then natural to explore the possibility of transferring these two - photon correlations to a collection of atoms to generate so - called correlated atomic squeezed ( spin squeezed ) states @xcite or atomic entangled states . to this end in this paper",
    "we study the interaction of n two - level atoms with a quantized single radiation mode of a non - stationary cavity with harmonically oscillating wall .",
    "in particular we focus our attention on the effect of modulation of the cavity mode frequency due to harmonic oscillation of the cavity mirror on the squeezing properties of an ensemble of atoms interacting with this cavity mode . here",
    "we wish to note that dynamics of n - two level atoms in a non - stationary cavity has already been investigated in the context of detection of photons generated in the cavity @xcite . on the other hand , in the present work we concentrate on the generation of atomic squeezed state in a non - stationary cavity .",

    "these states have found application in atomic clocks for reducing quantum noise @xcite and quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "the utility of atomic squeezed states in spectroscopy and meteorology has motivated us to explore the possibility of generation of these states in a non - stationary cavity .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized in following manner . in section",
    "ii we give description of the model used in this paper .",
    "the results are presented and discussed in section iii and the paper is concluded in section iv .",

    "@xcite , the hamiltonian for atom plus non - stationary cavity system under rotating wave approximation is written as ( we use @xmath1 throughout the paper ) @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the cavity annihilation and creation operators respectively , satisfying the commutation relation @xmath5 = 1 $ ] .",

    "the hilbert space of these atomic operators is spanned by symmetric dicke states @xmath13 with @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the total spin length is given by @xmath15 .",
    "the dicke states are eigenstates of @xmath16 and @xmath17 such that @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the lowering and raising operators act on these states as @xmath20 .",
    "the parameters @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 denote the atomic transition frequency , cavity mode frequency , and atom - field coupling constant ( which is assumed to be real ) respectively .",
    "the harmonic time dependence of the cavity mode frequency @xmath24 and the last term , which is nonlinear in @xmath3 and @xmath4 arise due to harmonic motion of the cavity boundary @xcite .",
    "a brief derivation of this nonlinear part of the hamiltonian is presented in appendix a. for the purpose of calculations , following earlier works , we assume that the cavity mode frequency has sinusoidal dependence given by @xmath25 with the unperturbed frequency @xmath26 , which is set to @xmath27 for simplicity and @xmath28 and @xmath29 representing the modulation amplitude and the modulation frequency respectively . furthermore , note that there are basically two kinds of non - adiabatic processes occurring in a non - stationary cavity system described by the above hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the first kind is characterized by the @xmath30 term in which the total number of photons inside the cavity does not change .",
    "such a process is known as the zero - photon process . on the other hand , the second kind",
    "is represented by the terms @xmath31 and @xmath32 which are responsible for the generation of squeezed photons from the vacuum state .",
    "the last term in the hamiltonian introduces two - photon correlation in the cavity mode and in this paper we explore the possibility of transferring this correlation from photons to atoms via atom - photon interaction .",

    "note that for @xmath24 independent of time the coefficient @xmath38 and the above hamiltonian reduces to tavis - cummings hamiltonian @xcite which has been extensively studied in the context of cavity - qed .",
    "having discussed the basic model of multi - atom system coupled to a field mode of a non - stationary cavity we now briefly describe the squeezing parameter employed in this paper to characterize the atomic squeezing .",
    "we note here that several definitions for the spin or atomic squeezing parameters have been proposed in the literature in different contexts @xcite .",
    "for example , according to the definition of kitagawa and ueda , a state is spin squeezed only if the variance of one spin component @xmath39 normal to the mean spin vector is less than the variance for a bloch state ( @xmath40 ) @xcite . in accordance with the definition of kitagawa and ueda ,",
    "spin squeezing parameter @xmath41 is written as @xcite :    @xmath42    where the subscript @xmath43 refers to an axis perpendicular to the mean - spin direction @xmath44 and the minimization is over all directions @xmath43 .",
    "this parameter is used to quantify the degree of quantum correlations among the elementary spins . the atomic - squeezing condition in terms of this parameter",
    "is given by the condition @xmath45 , i.e. , the fluctuation in one direction is reduced .",
    "indeed , it has a very close relation with quantities such as concurrence @xcite and negative correlations @xcite . on the other hand , the squeezing parameter proposed by wineland et al .",
    "@xcite was in the context of ramsey spectroscopy for the determination of transition frequency and consequently this parameter is also termed as spectroscopic squeezing .",
    "this squeezing parameter is related to the ratio of fluctuations in the measurement of resonance frequency using an ensemble of atoms in a general atomic state and in a coherent spin state .",
    "the spectroscopic squeezing parameter @xmath46 is given by @xmath47 these two squeezing parameters are related to each other and it can be seen from their definitions @xmath48 . in this paper",
    "we employ both the squeezing parameters mentioned above to characterize the squeezing of property of a collection of atoms interacting with field mode of a non - stationary cavity . to this end",
    "we need to calculate averages of angular momentum operators and their second - order moments in the combined state @xmath49 of atoms plus field satisfying time - dependent schrodinger equation    @xmath50    in order to solve this differential equation we make use of the ansatz @xmath51    where @xmath52 are the time - dependent coefficients and @xmath53 represents the number state , which is an eigenstate of number operator @xmath30 such that @xmath54 and @xmath55 . for convenience",
    "we use the notation @xmath56 since @xmath16 is constant of motion for @xmath57 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "we further assume that the radiation mode and the collection of atoms are initially uncorrelated and the initial state of the atom plus field system can be written as a direct product @xmath58 where @xmath59 represents the initial atomic state in which all the atoms are occupying their ground states and the coefficients @xmath60 are the projections of initial field state on the number state @xmath53 . using schrodinger s equation ( eq .",

    "consequently , one needs to solve these coupled differential equations numerically . to implement the numerical method for practical reasons it becomes necessary to truncate the number state basis of cavity mode",
    "to this end we choose adequate number of basis states @xmath53 and ensure the convergence of results by increasing the basis size . in the next section we present and discuss the results obtained by us .",
    "we begin this section by presenting the results , which have been obtained by numerically solving eq.([eq8 ] ) with @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) and considering initially the atomic and the cavity field mode to be in @xmath68 and vacuum state @xmath69 ( @xmath70 for @xmath71 and @xmath72 for @xmath73 ) respectively .",
    "the results for the evolution of atomic squeezing parameter @xmath74 and @xmath75 are displayed in figs .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) respectively for various values of modulation amplitude @xmath28 with the modulation frequency fixed at @xmath76 .",
    "this choice of value of modulation frequency is guided by the result that maximum number of squeezed photons are created in an ideal empty non - stationary cavity when the modulation frequency is twice that of unperturbed cavity mode frequency .",
    "it can be clearly seen that under this condition both the atomic squeezing parameters become less than @xmath27 for non - zero values of the modulation amplitude indicating generation of atomic or spin squeezed state . on the other hand , for @xmath77 , no atomic squeezing",
    "is observed as both @xmath74 and @xmath75 throughout remain unity .",
    "this constitutes the main result of this paper .",
    "moreover , we observe that the results presented in figs . 1(a ) and 1(b ) satisfy the inequality @xmath48 . the last term in the hamiltonian with @xmath31 and @xmath32 results in the generation of squeezed state of radiation field from the vacuum state via two - photon process and the two - photon correlation of squeezed state is transferred to the ensemble of atoms via interaction of atoms with this cavity field mode .",
    "moreover , from figs .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) , we observe that persistent atomic squeezing , which lasts for longer time duration is produced under resonant condition ( @xmath78 ) and the magnitude of squeezing also increases with the increase in modulation amplitude .",
    "this increase in atomic squeezing is attributed to the enhancement in squeezing characteristic of the cavity field with higher values of modulation amplitude @xmath28 .",
    "thus , the modulation amplitude acts as an additional tool for controlling the degree of atomic squeezing generated by photon - atom interaction in a non - stationary cavity .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ fig3 ]    having discussed the generation of atomic squeezed state in a non - stationary cavity with the field mode initially in the vacuum state we now consider the case when the cavity mode is initially prepared in a coherent state . in this connection",
    "we mention here that atomic squeezing property of a system of n two - level atoms interacting with a single radiation mode of a stationary cavity ( tavis - cummings model ) , which is initially in a coherent state has already been reported in ref .",
    "thus it would be interesting to investigate the effect of cavity oscillations , which gives rise to extra non - linear terms in the hamiltonian , on the squeezing property of atoms with the cavity mode in a coherent state .",
    "for this purpose once again we solve coupled differential equation of eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) numerically by using mathematica 9.0 .",
    "the calculations are carried out for initial atomic state @xmath68 with @xmath67 and for the field mode in a coherent state @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) with @xmath81 .",
    "the results of these calculations for @xmath74 and @xmath75 are shown in figs .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) respectively , where we plot squeezing parameters as functions of dimensionless time ( @xmath82 ) for three different values of modulation amplitude @xmath28 : @xmath83 ( thin solid line ) , @xmath84 ( thick solid line ) and @xmath85 ( dashed line ) .",
    "note that the result for @xmath77 corresponds to the stationary cavity case described by tavis - cummings model .",
    "first , we observe that for all the values of @xmath28 atomic squeezed states are generated in the time range @xmath86 by the interaction of atoms with the cavity radiation mode irrespective of the parameter employed for characterizing atomic squeezing .",
    "the comparison of results for different values of @xmath28 clearly reveals that within this time range atomic squeezing characterized by @xmath74 and @xmath75 show very little variation with respect to change in @xmath28 .",
    "on the other hand , for longer time scales ( @xmath87 ) two parameters exhibit distinctly different atomic squeezing behavior .",
    "for example , in the longer time scale @xmath74 attains value less than unity signifying generation of atomic squeezing and degree of squeezing increases with higher values of @xmath28 .",
    "in contrast to this in long time scale @xmath75 remains more than unity indicating absence of atomic squeezing .",
    "furthermore , we note here that comparison of results presented in fig .",
    "1 with the corresponding results in fig . 3 also shows that for field mode initially prepared in vacuum state atomic squeezing is achieved for significantly longer time scale as compared to the case when field mode is initially prepared in a coherent state .",
    "consequently , for the vacuum case unlike normal cavity qed experiment with cavity field in a coherent state the stringent requirement of the precise control of interaction time for the generation of atomic squeezed state is not necessary @xcite .",
    "the results discussed above on the generation of atomic squeezed state by dce can be realized with the help of practical schemes recently proposed for the generation and detection of dce photons @xcite . as mentioned before both the schemes have proposed to use the cavities operating in the ghz regime .",
    "therefore , the presence of thermal photon will affect the results discussed above . in order to reduce the effect of thermal photon on the generation of squeezed photons the cavity",
    "should be cooled below 100 mk . in a realistic cavity - qed system , decay of the cavity mode",
    "will also degrade the degree of field squeezing and this in turn affect the magnitude of atomic squeezing .",
    "however , the loss of photons through the cavity mirrors can be minimized by using a high - q cavity .",
    "for example , it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that using a semiconductor plasma mirror @xcite with q of the order @xmath88 it is possible to achieve the so - called threshold condition for generation of squeezed photons .",
    "therefore , we expect that a beam of rydberg atoms interacting with the field mode of this cavity will be able to produce significant amount of atomic squeezing .",
    "finally , the atomic squeezed states generated in the non - stationary cavity can be experimentally detected by performing measurement of atomic state population using ramsey separated field method on the rydberg atoms @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have studied the effect of periodic time modulation of cavity frequency on the generation of atomic or spin squeezed states . for this purpose",
    "we consider a system of n two - level atoms interacting with a single radiation mode of a non - stationary cavity with harmonically vibrating wall .",
    "we demonstrate that by modulating the cavity mode it is possible to generate atomic squeezed state by allowing an ensemble of atoms prepared in their ground states to interact with the cavity mode initially in vacuum state . in the absence of modulation ,",
    "no atomic squeezing is observed .",
    "like squeezed photon generation by dce the efficient generation of atomic squeezed states occurs when modulation frequency of the cavity mode is twice its own frequency . by studying a simpler system of two two - level atoms confined in a non - stationary cavity we explicitly show that atomic squeezing arises due to generation of coherent superposition of atomic states by transfer of two - photon correlation from field mode to the atoms .",
    "for this two - atom system we also derive analytical expression for atomic squeezing for a particular value of detuning between the modulation frequency and the cavity mode by considering dynamics of few essential states .",
    "we also study the effect of modulation on the generation of atomic squeezed state for the case in which the cavity mode is initially prepared in a coherent state .",
    "our study clearly reveals that for the cavity mode initially prepared in vacuum state the degree of atomic squeezing increases with the increase in modulation amplitude .",
    "therefore , modulation amplitude acts as an additional handle for controlling the squeezing of spins .",
