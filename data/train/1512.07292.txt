    "the main goal of this paper is to provide a mathematical survey of various pde models for fluttering plates @xcite and associated results , directed at an applied math and engineering readership .",
    "the focus here is on _ modeling concerns _ , and we provide a presentation and exposition of mathematical results ",
    "when available  and their relationship with known numerical and experimental results concerning flutter .",
    "we do not focus on proofs here , but try to give descriptions of results and a general intuition about why they hold .",
    "in addition we mention a handful of mathematical models which are of recent interest in aeroelasticity _ and also _ represent fertile ground from the point of view of mathematical analysis .",
    "the _ flutter pheonmenon _ is of great interest across many fields .",
    "flutter is a sustained , systemic instability which occurs as a feedback coupling between a thin structure and an inviscid fluid when the natural modes of the structure  couple \" with the fluid s dynamic loading .",
    "when a structure is immersed in a fluid flow certain flow velocities may bring about a bifurcation in the dynamics of the coupled _ flow - plate _ system ; at this point stable dynamics may become oscillatory ( limit cycle oscillations , or lco ) or even chaotic .",
    "a static bifurcation may also occur , known as _ divergence _ or buckling .",
    "the above phenomena can occur in a multitude of applications : buildings and bridges in strong winds , panel and flap structures on vehicles , and in the human respiratory system ( snoring and sleep apnea @xcite ) .",
    "recently , flutter resulting from _ axial flow _",
    "( which can be achieved for _ low flow velocities _ ) has been studied from the point of view of energy harvesting @xcite .",
    "flutter considerations are paramount in the supersonic and transonic regime , with the renewed interest in supersonic flight . from a design point of view",
    ", flutter can not be overlooked , owing to its potentially disastrous effects on the structure due to sustained fatigue or large amplitude response .",
    "the field of _ aeroelasticity _ is concerned with ( i ) producing models which describe the flutter phenomenon , ( ii ) gaining insight into the mechanisms of flow - structure coupling , ( iii ) predicting the behavior of a flow - structure system based on its configuration , and ( iv ) determining appropriate control mechanisms and their effect in the prevention or suppression of instability in the flow - structure system . here",
    "we consider flow - plate dynamics corresponding to both _",
    "subsonic _ and _ supersonic _ flow regimes and a wide array of structural boundary conditions and flow - plate coupling conditions .",
    "flow - structure models have attracted considerable attention in the past mathematical literature , see , e.g. , @xcite and the references therein .",
    "however , the majority of the work ( predominantly in the engineering literature ) that has been done on flow - structure interactions has been devoted to numerical and experimental studies , see , for instance , @xcite , and also the survey  @xcite and the literature cited there .",
    "many mathematical studies have been based on linear , two dimensional , plate models with specific geometries , where the primary goal was to determine the _ flutter point _",
    "( i.e. , the flow speed at which flutter occurs ) @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for the recent studies of linear models with a one dimensional flag - type structure ( beams ) .",
    "this line of work has focused primarily on spectral properties of the system , with particular emphasis on identifying aeroelastic _",
    "eigenmodes _ corresponding to the associated possio integral equation ( addressed classically by @xcite ) .",
    "we emphasize that these investigations have been _ linear _ , as their primary goal is to predict the flutter phenomenon and isolate aeroelastic modes .",
    "given the difficulty of modeling coupled pdes at an interface @xcite , theoretical results have been sparse .",
    "additionally , flutter is an inherently nonlinear phenomenon ; although the flutter point ( the flow velocity for which the transition to periodic or chaotic behavior occurs ) can be ascertained within the realm of linear theory , predicting the magnitude of the instability requires a nonlinear model of the structure ( and potentially for the flow as well ) @xcite .",
    "the results presented herein demonstrate that flutter models can be studied from an infinite dimensional point of view , and moreover that meaningful statements can be made about the physical mechanisms in flow - structure interactions _ strictly from the pde model_. the challenges in the analysis involve ( i ) the mismatch of regularity between two types of dynamics : the flow and the structure which are coupled in a hybrid way , ( ii ) the physically required presence of unbounded or ill - defined terms ( boundary traces in the coupling conditions ) , and ( iii ) intrinsically non - dissipative generators of dynamics , even in the linear case .",
    "( the latter are associated with potentially chaotic behavior . )",
    "one of the intriguing aspects of flow - structure dynamics is that the type of instability , whether static ( divergence ) or dynamic ( lco ) , depends both on the plate boundary conditions and on the free - stream ( or unperturbed ) flow velocity .",
    "for example , one observes that if a ( two - dimensional ) panel is simply supported or clamped on the leading _ and _ trailing edge it undergoes divergence in subsonic flow but flutters in supersonic flow ; conversely , a cantilevered panel clamped at one end and free along the others flutters in subsonic flow and may undergo divergence in supersonic flows @xcite .",
    "this paper primarily addresses the interactive dynamics between a nonlinear plate and a surrounding potential and [ visc - flow ] . ]",
    ". the description of physical phenomena such as flutter and divergence will translate into mathematical questions related to existence of nonlinear semigroups representing a given dynamical system , asymptotic stability of trajectories , and convergence to equilibria or to compact attracting sets .",
    "interestingly enough , different model configurations lead to an array of diverse mathematical issues that involve not only classical pdes , but subtle questions in non - smooth elliptic theory , harmonic analysis , and singular operator theory . for more details concerning the mathematical theory developed for",

    "one would like to show that such dynamics , as described above , are stable in the sense that trajectories converge asymptotically to a  nice \" set . unlike parabolic dynamics , there is no a priori reason to expect that hyperbolic - like dynamics can be asymptotically reduced to a truly finite dimensional dynamics . by showing that the pde dynamics converges to a finite dimensional ( compact ) _ attractor _ it effectively allows the asymptotic - in - time reduction of the analysis of the infinite dimensional , unstable model to a finite dimensional set upon which classical control theory can be applied .",
    "we note that owing to the non - dissipative terms present in flutter models , global attractors associated to plate s flutter dynamics ( as well as the set of equilibria points for the full flow - plate system ) can have non - trivial structure .",

    ", mentioned in remark [ axial ] , a beam or plate is clamped on the _ leading edge _ and free elsewhere is described . to provide a clear picture of the dynamics ,",
    "consider the figure at the beginning of section [ recent ] with the over - body flow occurring in the _ @xmath196-direction _ , as opposed to being in the direction of the plate s chord@xmath24-direction . in the engineering literature .",
    "] this axial configuration , owing to lco response to low flow velocities @xcite , is that which has been considered from the point of view of energy harvesting .",
    "this would be accomplished by configuring an axially oriented flap on land or air vehicles with a piezo device which could generate current as it flutters @xcite . from @xcite",
    "the appropriate structural equations of motion here correspond to those of a thin pipe conveying fluid , and many aspects of such dynamics mirror those we are investigating @xcite .",
    "expressions for the kinetic and potential energy of the beam and plate are given in @xcite .",
    "note that structural nonlinearities occur in both the inertia ( kinetic energy ) and stiffness ( potential energy ) terms for the structural equations of motion .",
    "the recent theoretical and experimental work of tang and dowell @xcite has been encouraging . in this work a new nonlinear structural model has been used based upon the inextensibility assumption and the comparison between theory and experiment for the lco response has been much improved over earlier results @xcite .",
    "the study of a linear aerodynamic model , combined with the new nonlinear structural model , is worthy of more rigorous mathematical attention .",
    "much of the technical discussion presented above excludes the sonic velocity @xmath276 ; in practice , the vicinity of @xmath277 is known as the _ transonic regime_. indeed , for @xmath26 the analysis provided above for the panel configuration breaks down in the essential way @xcite . while numerical work predicts appearance of shock waves @xcite , to our best knowledge no mathematical treatment of this problem is available at present .    in the literature @xcite",
    ", it is noted that the flow model discussed above in is not accurate in the regime @xmath278 $ ] . ] ; indeed , the flow equations require additional specificity when the flow velocity nears the transonic regime .",
    "we note that the base model in becomes interesting , as a _ degenerate wave equation _ appears when @xmath26 .",
    "this will clearly produce diminished regularity in the @xmath24 direction .",
    "however , the references @xcite suggest that in the transonic regime a fully nonlinear fluid must be considered . from @xcite :  ... neglecting either the structural or the fluid nonlinearities can lead to completely erroneous stability predictions . \"",
    "the reference @xcite indicates that in the case of the standard panel configuration the appropriate flow equation  due to the _ local mach number _ effect  for transonic dynamics is of the form : @xmath279 here @xmath25 is replaced with @xmath280 indicating that @xmath281 .",
    "this nonlinear fluid equation introduces new mathematical challenges which must be addressed . in the case of supersonic or subsonic flows ,",
    "the definite sign of the spatial flow operator associated to the @xmath24 variable can be exploited .",
    "additionally , the nature of the dynamics become quasilinear in the flow potential @xmath20 . thus , near the transonic barrier the flow equation becomes @xmath24-degenerate and quasilinear .",
    "experimentally , one notes that near @xmath26 there are many peculiarities , including the possibility of hysteresis @xcite in @xmath25 , and various flow instabilities , including shocks @xcite .",
    "such shocks may actually induce flutter .",
    "in fact , recent numerical investigations @xcite investigate the emergence of _ single mode flutter _ in low supersonic speeds , and the possibility of stabilizing this mode via structural damping .",
    "however , the results in @xcite indicate that shocks emanating from the flow may actually induce more complex coupled mode ( coalescence @xcite ) flutter . also in the transonic range , viscous fluid boundary layer effects are apt to be more important @xcite .",
    "it is essential that interaction between structural nonlinearities and the aerodynamic nonlinearities be accounted for . in @xcite , numerical studies of the interaction between structural and aerodynamic nonlinearities have been investigated .",
    "according to this study , so called _ traveling wave flutter _",
    "occurs in the transonic regime .",
    "in fact , for a simply supported panel , at @xmath282 of altitude , with a thickness - chord ratio of @xmath283 traveling wave flutter has been recorded in the form of wave packets ; these packets change shape and evolve in time during the movement from the leading to the trailing edge . near the panel there has been evidence of shocks forming , moving in concert with the panel motion , and in some cases _ inducing _ flutter .    from the mathematical point of view , one notes that a key issue is the regularity of flow solutions in the @xmath24-direction .",
    "however , as @xmath284 becomes degenerate , a term providing additional information in the @xmath24 direction of the flow appears .",
    "specifically , in energy calculations , the quasilinearity gives rise to a conserved quantity in the flow energy of the form @xmath285 so @xmath286.\\ ] ] this quantity , although conserved , has a  bad \" sign , which is a potential indicator for shock phenomena .",
    "it seems clear that the analytical techniques will differ for @xmath287 and @xmath288 .",
    "moreover , if well - posedness can be established , owing to physical results , we anticipate that the qualitative properties of these flow ( and hence flow - structure ) solutions will be quite distinct .    from the point of view of quasilinear theory",
    ", the term @xmath289 provides dominant control of the operator @xmath290 , and can not be neglected in this transonic case .",
    "in fact , the corresponding pde problem can be viewed from the point of view of the tricomi operator @xcite changing from elliptic to hyperbolic , depending on the direction of the change in deflection .",
    "this is an exciting question to study mathematically ; the inroads provided by numerics and experiment here are instrumental guiding forces .",
    "in conclusion we recall shortly several observations made in @xcite which , on one hand confirm experimentally and numerically some of the mathematical findings and , on the other hand , raise open questions and indicate new avenues for mathematical research . for more detailed discussion",
    "we refer to our paper @xcite .    1 .",
    "* stability induced by the flow in reducing dynamics to finite dimensions * : rigorous mathematical analysis reveals that the stabilizing effect of the flow reduces the structural dynamics to a _",
    "finite dimensional _ setting .",
    "it is remarkable that such conclusion is obtained directly from mathematical considerations  as it is not definitively arrived at by either numerics or experiment .",
    "* non - uniqueness of final nonlinear state * : it is possible that there exist several _ locally _ stable equilibria in the global attractor of the system .",
    "this explains why the _ buckled plate _ in an aerodynamic flow does not have a final , unique nonlinear state .",
    "* surprisingly subtle effects of boundary conditions * : as the structure s boundary conditions are changed , so is the dynamic stability / instability of the system .",
    "experimental and numerical and theoretical studies confirm this .",
    "* limitations of vk theory and new nonlinear plate theory * : when the leading edge is clamped and the side edges and trailing edge are free , the vk theory can be no longer accurate . however , a novel , improved nonlinear plate theory has been developed and explored computationally and correlated with experiment .",
    "this provides a challenging opportunity for mathematical analysis .",
    "* aerodynamic theory * : it may be helpful to prove , mathematically , some of the results related to the justification of the recent developments in piston theory .",
    "this issue is also important for modeling the pressure due to solar radiation , which has a similar mathematical form to that of piston theory @xcite .",
    "it has been of recent interest in the context of interplanetary transportation using solar sails .",
