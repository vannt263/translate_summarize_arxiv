    "recent advances in spintronics and spincaloritronics@xcite have prompted the search for ferro- and ferrimagnetic insulating materials applicable in thin films . since the discovery of the spin seebeck effect ( sse ) in 2008 by uchida _",
    "et al._,@xcite numerous publications focused on investigations of the sse both in a transverse ( tsse ) and in a longitudinal ( lsse ) configuration.@xcite however , in a longitudinal configuration the sse can hardly be distinguished from the anomalous nernst effect ( ane ) , if ferromagnetic , conducting materials are investigated.@xcite this makes observations of the lsse in metallic thin films challenging .",
    "more suitable materials for studies of the lsse are ferromagnetic insulators .",
    "the lack of free charge carriers in insulating materials like yttrium iron garnet ( yig ) can prevent the appearance of ane and , therefore , allows to identify the lsse unequivocally.@xcite also , a wide range of other spincaloric and spintronic effects , like the recently proposed spin hall magnetoresistance ( smr)@xcite benefit from the supression of charge currents in magnetic systems with high resistivity . in smr based devices ,",
    "the insulating behaviour reduces shorting through the magnetic layer and can eliminate an anisotropic magnetoresistance ( amr ) .",
    "this enables to measure the smr without parasitic effects.@xcite    some of the spinel ferrites are ferrimagnetic and semiconducting .",
    "these materials are a promising alternative to several compounds of the garnet class@xcite for a broad range of spincaloric and spintronic applications .",
    "for example , the lsse was also observed in ( mn , zn)fe@xmath0o@xmath1,@xcite in nickelferrite ( nife@xmath0o@xmath1)@xcite and in magnetite ( fe@xmath5o@xmath1 ) below the verwey transition.@xcite the class of spinel ferrites is characterized by the general formula ab@xmath0o@xmath1 , where a and b denote divalent and trivalent cations , respectively . each conventional unit cell of a spinel ferrite consists of 8 formula units ab@xmath0o@xmath1 , leading to 32 divalent oxygen anions forming a face centered cubic structure within the unit cell .",
    "two separate sublattices are formed , denoted as tetrahedral and octahedral , based on their coordination numbers 4 and 6 regarding the neighbouring oxygen anions , respectively .    in our study",
    "we focus on the inverse spinel ferrite nife@xmath0o@xmath1 ( nfo ) , which shows both lsse@xcite and smr.@xcite in the inverse spinel structure half of the b@xmath4 cations reside on tetrahedral sites while the remaining b@xmath4 and a@xmath3 cations are located on octahedral sites.@xcite nfo offers the advantage to switch on or off parasitic effects like the ane by changing the temperature , due to its semiconducting properties . the compound is a ferrimagnet below the curie temperature t@xmath6k@xcite , with an antiferromagnetic coupling between the tetrahedral and octahedral sublattices .",
    "a wide range of chemical and physical deposition techniques has been utilized to fabricate ferrite thin films .",
    "however , pulsed laser deposition ( pld ) has been established as the most common method for synthesizing high quality ferrite thin films.@xcite here we report on the fabrication of high - quality epitaxial nfo thin films by reactive magnetron co - sputter deposition .",
    "this is beneficial for the integration of nfo in technological applications , as this method is compatible with a wide range of other fabrication techniques and allows for a high growth rate .",
    "epitaxial nfo thin films were grown by ultra high vacuum reactive dc magnetron co - sputtering in a pure oxygen atmosphere at various substrate temperatures ( @xmath7c to @xmath8c ) .",

    "the deposition rate was @xmath13 / s .",
    "the film thicknesses were 28 nm for the temperature series and 58 nm for samples deposited in a subsequent series at @xmath14c .",
    "x - ray reflectivity ( xrr ) was used to calibrate the film thickness .",
    "x - ray fluorescence ( xrf ) was used to quantify the ni : fe ratio . in order to study the crystallographic properties of the films , x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) measurements",
    "were carried out in a bragg brentano configuration .",
    "the xrr , xrf , and xrd studies were performed in a philips xpert pro diffractometer with a cu k@xmath15 source .",
    "x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) gave additional information about the cation valencies .",
    "the xps measurements were performed using a phi5600ci multitechnique spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic al k@xmath15 source ( 1486.7ev ) with 0.3ev full width at half - maximum .",
    "the overall resolution of the spectrometer is 1.5% of the pass energy of the analyzer , 0.45ev in the present case .",
    "complementary fe 2p spectra were also recorded with an mg k@xmath15 standard non monochromatic x - ray source ( 1253.6ev ) .",
    "the measurements were recorded with the sample at room temperature .",
    "the thin nfo films were rinsed with isopropanol just before mounting them into the loadlock of the experimental chamber .",
    "no other preparation of the sample surface , e.g. by ar ion sputtering was performed , in particular to avoid a reduction of the fe and ni ions .",
    "the spectra were calibrated with a corresponding measurement of the au 4@xmath16 level ( 84.0ev ) of a gold foil .",
    "the magnetic properties were investigated by alternating gradient magnetometry ( agm ) in a princeton micromag with magnetic fields of up to 13koe .",

    "optical spectroscopy in the range of @xmath17 to @xmath18ev was performed in a perkin elmer lambda 950 spectrometer .",
    "reflection and transmission spectra were recorded to obtain the absorption coefficient and derive the optical bandgap .",

    "element specific x - ray absorption ( xas ) , magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) , and magnetic linear dichroism ( xmld ) measurements were taken at room temperature at beamline 4.0.2 of the advanced light source , berkeley .",
    "the substrate luminescence was detected with a photodiode to measure the absorption signal of the films in addition to the sample drain current ( total electron yield ) .",

    "an exchange field of @xmath26mev was applied to break the spin symmetry . for ni ,",
    "a lorentzian broadening of 0.15ev ( 0.3ev ) was applied to the l@xmath5 ( l@xmath0 ) edges to account for lifetime effects .",
    "for fe , the lorentzian broadening was set to 0.2ev ( 0.4ev ) .",
    "an additional gaussian broadening of 0.15ev was applied to account for the finite resolving power of the instrumentation .",
    "additionally , the calculated spectrum of the octahedral fe@xmath4 was shifted by @xmath27ev to higher energy .",

    "weak laue oscillations were observed at the ( 004 ) peak in the 600@xmath20c curve , indicating the smoothest interfaces for this deposition temperature .",
    "a significant out - of - plane strain is visible in all samples .",
    "the deviations of the vertical lattice parameter with respect to the bulk lattice constant ( a@xmath29 ) can be derived from the peak positions in the xrd scans ( see inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : xrd ] ) .",
    "the films deposited at 400@xmath20c , 500@xmath20c , and 600@xmath20c show the same vertical lattice parameter a@xmath30 , which is in good agreement with the values found by foerster _",
    "_ in pulsed laser deposited thin films on mao , but is significantly larger than the bulk value.@xcite the increase of the vertical lattice parameter with respect to the bulk value implies that the films are tetragonally distorted , i.e. expanded in the direction perpendicular to the surface and compressed in the film plane , due to a comparatively large mismatch with the mao(001 ) substrate ( a@xmath31 ) . however , with increasing deposition temperature the lattice parameter decreases leading to a@xmath32 and a@xmath33 for the films sputtered at 700@xmath20c and 800@xmath20c , respectively .",

    "[ fig : agm ] displays the magnetization after subtraction of a linear background .",
    "it is observed that the coercivity decreases with increasing temperature ( see inset a ) ) .",
    "since a lower coercivity can be generated by less pinning centers and , therefore , less defects in the material , this reciprocal dependence between coercivity and deposition temperature confirms a lower defect density for higher deposition temperatures.@xcite    the saturation magnetization shows a different behaviour .",
    "it increases from 400@xmath20c to 600@xmath20c , but decreases slightly for 700@xmath20c and drastically for 800@xmath20c deposition temperature .",
    "this trend in the temperature dependence is depicted in inset b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : agm ] .",
    "the highest saturation magnetization of about 236emu/@xmath34 is observed for deposition at 600@xmath20c . since there seems to be no",
    "generally accepted value for the bulk saturation magnetization we can only state that it probably lies between 270emu/@xmath34 and 300emu/@xmath34.@xcite a lower magnetization in thin films with respect to bulk has been observed in nfo before,@xcite as well as in other inverse spinel ferrites like magnetite ( fe@xmath5o@xmath1).@xcite the reduced magnetization at 13koe may arise from antiferromagnetic pinning in antiphase boundaries , the density of which critically depends on the preparation conditions.@xcite another mechanism of reduction of the magnetization may be the formation of disordered regions between crystallites.@xcite the large coercive field of the films ( around @xmath35oe ) is in agreement with a relatively high defect density . in both cases ,",
    "full saturation is obtained at much higher fields , so the background subtraction in measurements with only a few tesla may be incorrect .",
    "based on the former results , additional samples were produced at a substrate temperature of 680@xmath20c with a thickness of about 58 nm and more detailed studies were carried out .",
    "the samples again crystallized well with a ( 001 ) orientation and showed smooth surfaces in the xrr diffraction patterns .",
    "the vertical lattice parameter a@xmath36 is less expanded than in the corresponding films from the temperature series , due to an increased lattice relaxation with increasing thickness .",
    "we also derived an in - plane lattice parameter a@xmath37 from an analysis of the ( 066 ) peak . as expected , the values reveal a pronounced tetragonal distortion for growth on mao ( 001 ) substrates with @xmath38 .",
    "the unit cell volume is reduced by about 2% with respect to bulk material .",
    "the additional samples had a slightly lower magnetization ( around 200 emu/@xmath34 ) than the films prepared earlier for the deposition temperature series .",
    "no out - of - plane anisotropy was observed , in line with the theoretical prediction by fritsch _",

    "the roughness is about 0.27 nm ( rms ) and 0.21 nm ( average ) .",
    "the small roughness of the films is beneficial for the integration of nfo in spincaloric devices , as it enables high interface quality and , therefore , high spin mixing conductances across the interfaces .",

    "_ in nfo single crystals , and ponpandian _",
    "_ in nfo nanoparticles.@xcite however , the value is six times smaller than the bandgap we find by optical spectroscopy .",
    "since electrical conductivity is sensitive to all charge transport mechanisms present in the film , chemical impurities can significantly lower the observed activation energy .",
    "it has been suggested that the electric transport in ferrites is driven by charge carrier exchange between divalent and trivalent cations on equivalent lattice sites.@xcite in the case of nfo , small amounts of excess fe or ni might enter the lattice on octahedral sites during the preparation process as fe@xmath3 or ni@xmath4 ions , respectively.@xcite alternatively , an oxygen deficit would lead to incomplete oxidation of fe atoms , generating fe@xmath3 instead of trivalent species .",

    "however , since the fe 2p spectrum recorded with the monochromatic al k@xmath15 source is to some extent overlapped by an ni l@xmath5m@xmath57m@xmath58 auger peak the typical charge transfer feature for fe@xmath4 ions in oxidic materials ( around 719ev ) appears to be obscured . therefore , we performed an additional measurement with a standard non monochromatic mg k@xmath15 source . here",
