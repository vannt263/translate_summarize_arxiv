    "electrons moving in a multiply connected geometry threaded by a magnetic flux @xmath5 are an ideal system to observe quantum mechanical phase coherence .",
    "if an electron encircles a flux threaded hole on a closed path , the phase difference of its wave function must be a multiple of @xmath6 plus the aharonov - bohm phase @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the flux quantum @xcite .",
    "therefore , a finite phase gradient persists in the wave function for all flux values @xmath9 .",
    "consequently , a persistent current is flowing around the hole , which is modulated by the magnetic flux with a period of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is best observed in phase coherent superconducting ( sc ) rings @xcite .",
    "measurements of magnetic flux trapped in sc rings showed that the flux is quantized in multiples of @xmath11 @xcite , which implies a flux periodicity of @xmath0 for the circulating supercurrent and likewise for all thermodynamic quantities @xcite .",
    "indeed , the same periodicity has been found by little and parks in measurements of the critical temperature @xmath12 of flux threaded cylinders @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 flux periodicity of the sc state is naturally contained in the bcs pairing theory of superconductivity @xcite , as was shown by byers and yang @xcite and independently by brenig @xcite and by onsager @xcite .",
    "byers and yang introduced two distinct classes of sc wave functions , which are not related by a gauge transformation ; one class of states has minima in the free energy at even multiples of the sc flux quantum @xmath11 , whereas the second class has minima at odd multiples of @xmath11 .",
    "they proved that the minima in the free energy become degenerate in the thermodynamic limit and all thermodynamic quantities @xmath0 periodic .",
    "in finite systems , this degeneracy is lifted .",
    "consequences for flux - dependent oscillations of @xmath12 have been investigated by bogachek @xcite using a quasi one dimensional ( 1d ) thin - ring model with @xmath1-wave pairing .",
    "this and other recent works , including an analysis of the supercurrent , made evident that @xmath1-wave rings smaller than the sc coherence length @xmath2 display a flux periodicity of @xmath3 rather than the anticipated @xmath0 periodicity @xcite .",
    "special attention arose from numerical investigations of sc @xmath4-wave loops @xcite , in which the distinction of the two classes of sc states is more pronounced than in @xmath1-wave rings .",
    "these results agree with the analytical approaches using the thin - ring model @xcite and will be extended in this article towards a two dimensional ( 2d ) multi - channel model .",
    "discrete lattice .",
    "the interior of the cylinder is threaded by a magnetic flux @xmath5 ; we assume that the flux does not penetrate into the cylinder itself .",
    "in such a system , @xmath5 can be chosen arbitrarily , since quantization applies to the fluxoid and not the flux itself.,width=317 ]    for the discussion of the flux periodicity of the supercurrent we choose a discrete 2d lattice in a cylindrical geometry ( figure  [ fig0 ] ) .",
    "we recall that the magnetic flux threading a superconducting loop is quantized in units of the superconducting flux quantum @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this quantization reflects the minima of the free energy @xcite .",
    "these minima are determined by gauge invariance and the electron interaction ; the flux quantum @xmath0 is therefore a fundamental property of any superconductor .",
    "flux quantization in a cylinder requires that its walls are thicker than the penetration depth @xmath13 .",
    "if the walls are thinner than @xmath13 , the cylinder can be threaded by an arbitrary magnetic flux and only the quantity called fluxoid is quantized @xcite . in this situation",
    ", it is the flux periodicity of thermodynamical quantities such as the supercurrent or @xmath12 , for which the pairing of electrons suggests @xmath0 periodicity .    for two reasons we expect nodal rather than nodeless superconductors to support an @xmath3 periodicity .",
    "the first arises from the discrete nature of the eigenenergies in a finite system .",
    "the results of the summation over occupied eigenstates for integer and half - integer flux values differ by an amount proportional to the mean level spacing @xmath14 in the vicinity of the fermi energy @xmath15 . in the normal state ,",
    "@xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the volume of the system . for the thin cylinder shown in figure  [ fig0 ] with a circumference @xmath18 and a height @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the lattice constant , the level spacing is @xmath21 ; in @xmath1-wave superconductors with an order parameter @xmath22 , @xmath14 matters little . for sc states with gap nodes",
    ", the situation is different .",
    "for example , in the @xmath4-wave superconductors with an order parameter @xmath23 , the nodal states closest to @xmath15 have to fulfill the condition @xmath24 , thus there are fewer possible eigenstates and @xmath25 .",
    "the second reason is that for gapless superconductors with a finite density of states ( dos ) close to @xmath15 , the occupation probabilities of these states change with flux .",
    "the flux dependence of the occupation enhances the difference of current matrix elements for integer and half - integer flux values @xcite .",
    "this effect can be understood in terms of the spacial extension of a cooper pair . in @xmath1-wave superconductors ,",
    "the occupation probability remains constant for all @xmath5 , if the diameter of the cylinder is larger than @xmath2 .",
    "if this condition is fulfilled , the constituents of a cooper pair can not circulate separately ; the pair does not feel  the multiply connected geometry of the cylinder .",
    "but for nodal sc states , the length scale which characterizes their coherence , diverges in the nodal directions and there are always cooper pairs which extend around the circumference of the cylinder .",
    "therefore nodal superconductors have no characteristic length scale above which the sc state is unaffected by the geometry of the system .",
    "these two combined effects are investigated on the basis of an analytical model in section  [ sec3 ] and by numerical calculations in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "the properties of a finite - size multiply connected superconductor depend sensitively on the discrete energy spectrum in the normal state , in particular in circular symmetric geometries . to understand the sc spectrum of the discrete @xmath26 lattice",
    ", we therefore have to characterize first its normal state spectrum .",
    "to illustrate the problem , we consider the tight - binding spectrum of a 1d ring with @xmath27 lattice sites and nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath28 .",
    "a half - filled band corresponds to chemical potential @xmath29 in equation  ( [ s1 ] ) .",
    "if @xmath30 is an integer , there is an energy level at energy @xmath31 for @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the dimensionless magnetic flux .",
    "if @xmath30 is a half - integer , the levels are symmetrically distributed above and below @xmath31 ( figure  [ fig0.1 ] ) . as a function of flux , the spectrum is @xmath34-periodic in both cases",
    ". if @xmath27 is odd , there are two possible configurations of energy levels , as shown in figure  [ fig0.1](c ) . in both configurations with odd @xmath27 ,",
    "two levels cross @xmath15 in one flux period .",
    "the combination of a particle - like and a hole - like band , used to construct the sc spectrum , then becomes @xmath0 periodic .",
    "these number dependent , qualitative differences control the flux dependence of the normal persistent current , as was shown by bttiker and by cheung @xcite .",
    "whenever an energy level crosses @xmath15 with increasing flux , the current reverses its sign , thus it is @xmath34-periodic for even @xmath27 and either paramagnetic or diamagnetic in the vicinity of @xmath32 , and it is @xmath0-periodic for odd @xmath27 .",
    "the lattice - size dependence persists also in rings with electron - electron interactions @xcite or in mesoscopic sc islands @xcite and in particular in a 2d cylinder geometry with circumference @xmath18 and height @xmath19 .",
    "each energy level of the 1d case splits up into @xmath35 levels , which results in a characteristic flux dependence of the spectral density . for special ratios @xmath36 , the flux values where the 1d levels cross have a high degeneracy ; for @xmath37 ,",
    "the degree of degeneracy is @xmath35 . for the latter case",
    ", the differences between the spectrum for integer and half - integer flux values are most pronounced ; they are similar to the 1d spectrum of figure  [ fig0.1](a ) , if @xmath27 and @xmath35 are even , and similar to the spectrum of figure  [ fig0.1](b ) , if @xmath27 and @xmath35 are odd . for @xmath38 ,",
    "the spectrum is almost @xmath0-periodic , which is the extension of the odd @xmath27 case in the 1d ring .",
    "away from these special choices of @xmath27 and @xmath35 , the degeneracies are lifted , indicated by the blue shaded patches   in figure  [ fig0.1 ] .",
    "the inclusion of a next - nearest neighbor hopping term or a change of @xmath39 in equation  ( [ s1 ] ) has a similar effect , as shown by zhu @xcite .",
    "the size of the normal persistent current circulating around the cylinder is controlled by the change of the dos near @xmath15 upon increasing @xmath40 . since normal persistent currents in metallic rings are typically @xmath3 periodic @xcite , we will choose @xmath37 and @xmath29 for our model study , where the @xmath3 periodicity of the spectrum is most clearly established , and we will use even @xmath27 and @xmath35 for all subsequent calculations . in this section and in section  [ sec3 ] we show how this size dependent features survive into a sc state with gap nodes .",
