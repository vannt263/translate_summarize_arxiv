    "to understand the internal structure of scalar mesons has been a prominent topic in the last 30 - 40 years .",
    "although the scalar mesons have been investigated for several decades , many properties of them are not so clear yet and identifying the scalar mesons is difficult , experimentally .",
    "hence , the theoretical works can play a crucial role in this respect . in particle physics",
    ", the quarkonia refers to flavorless mesons containing a heavy b ( c ) quark and its own antiquark , i.e. , @xmath3 ( bottomonium ) and @xmath4 ( charmonium ) .",
    "these approximately non - relativistic systems are the best candidates to investigate the hadronic dynamics and study the perturbative and non - perturbative aspects of qcd .",
    "it was believed that the quarkonia can help us to extract the nature of quark - antiquark interaction at the hadronic scale and play the same role in probing the qcd as the hydrogen atom play in the atomic physics @xcite .",
    "a large number of the beauty and charmed systems have been experimentally observed in the last few decades ( see for instance @xcite ) and the theoretical calculations on the properties of these systems have been made mainly using potential model , where the quarkonia is described by a static potential , @xmath5 and its extensions like the coulomb gauge model @xcite .",
    "the first term in the potential is related to one gluon exchange and the second term is called the confinement potential .",
    "the recent cleo measurements on the two - photon decay rates of the even - parity , p - wave scalar @xmath6 and tensor @xmath7 states ( @xcite and references therein ) were motivation to investigate the properties of the quarkonia and their radiative decays from the quark - antiquark interaction point of view ( see for example @xcite ) .    in @xcite , which is a recent study on extraction of ground - state decay constant from both sum rules and potential models ,",
    "it is stated that results obtained at each step of the extraction procedure both in qcd and in potential models follow the same pattern , hence all our findings concerning the extraction of bound - state parameters from correlation functions obtained in potential model can apply also to qcd .",
    "it is also proven that in qcd sum rules approach by tunning the continuum threshold which is related to the energy of the first exited state specially with a borel - parameter dependent threshold , we can get a more reliable and accurate determination of bound - state characteristics comparing the potential models .",
    "the qcd sum rules approach as a non - perturbative approach is one of the most powerful and applicable tools to spectroscopy of hadrons and can play a crucial role in investigation of the properties of the hadrons@xcite .",
    "it has been used to calculate the masses and decay constants of mesons @xcite .",
    "this approach was extended to contain the properties of the hadrons at finite temperature called thermal qcd sum rules @xcite supposing that the operator product expansion ( ope ) and the quark - hadron duality assumption remain valid , however the quark - quark , quark - gluon and gluon - gluon condensates are altered by their thermal versions .",
    "the main aspiration of this addendum was to explain the results obtained from the heavy ion collision experiments .",
    "it is presently believed that the hot and dense medium where the hadrons are formed modifies masses and decay widths of hadrons .",
    "it is shown that heavy mesons like @xmath8 and also radial and orbital @xmath9 excitations have different behavior when the temperature of the medium changes ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in @xcite , scalar mesons and scalar glueballs are investigated in holographic qcd at finite temperature .",
    "a flood of papers have also been dedicated generally to the determination of the condensates , mass and decay constant of mesons and some properties of the nucleons at finite temperature @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we calculate the mass and decay constant of the heavy scalar @xmath10 mesons with quantum numbers @xmath1 using the thermal qcd sum rules approach .",
    "here , we assume that with replacing the vacuum condensates and also the continuum threshold by their thermal version , the sum rules for the observables ( masses and decay constants ) remain valid . in calculations ,",
    "we take into account the additional operators in the wilson expansion at finite temperature @xcite and modify spectral density in qcd side .",
    "these operators are due to the breakdown of lorentz invariance at finite temperature by the selection of the thermal rest frame , where matter is at rest at a definite temperature @xcite . in this condition",
    ", the residual o(3 ) invariance brings these extra operators with the same mass dimension as the vacuum condensates .",
    "we also consider the interaction of the currents with the existing particles in the medium at finite temperature .",
    "such interactions require modification of the hadron spectral density .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in next section , sum rules for the the mass and the decay constant of the heavy scalar , @xmath10 mesons are obtained in the framework of the qcd sum rules at finite temperature .",
    "section iii encompasses our numerical predictions for the mass and decay constants as well as comparison of the results with the existing predictions of the other non - perturbative approaches and experimental values .",
    "in this section , we obtain sum rules for the mass as well as the decay constant of the scalar quarkonia containing b or c quark in the framework of the thermal qcd sum rules . for this aim",
    ", we will evaluate the two - point thermal correlation function , @xmath11 in two different ways : physical and theoretical representations . in correlation function @xmath12",
    "denotes the temperature , @xmath13 is the time ordering product and @xmath14 is the interpolating current of the heavy scalar meson , @xmath15 .",
    "the thermal average of any operator , _ a _ can be expressed as : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the qcd hamiltonian , and @xmath18 is the inverse of the temperature @xmath12 and traces are carried out over any complete set of states .",
    "the physical or phenomenological representation of the aforementioned two - point correlation function is obtained in terms of the hadronic parameters saturating it with a tower of scalar mesons with the same quantum numbers as the interpolating current .",
    "the theoretical or qcd representation is gained via operator product expansion ( ope ) in terms of the qcd parameters such as quark s masses , and the vacuum condensates considering the internal structure of these mesons , i.e. , quarks , gluons and their interactions with each other as well as with the qcd vacuum . sum rules for the physical observables such as the decay constant and mass are obtained equating these two different representations through dispersion relation . to suppress the contribution of the higher states and continuum , borel transformation with respect to the @xmath19",
    "is applied to both sides of the sum rules for physical quantities .    to calculate the phenomenological part",
    ", we insert a complete set of intermediate states owing the same quantum numbers with current @xmath20 between the currents in eq .",
    "( [ correl.func.1 ] ) and perform the integral over . as a result , at @xmath21",
    ", we obtain @xmath22 where @xmath23 represents the contributions of the higher states and continuum and @xmath24 is mass of the heavy scalar meson .",
    "the matrix element creating the scalar meson from the vacuum can be written in terms of the decay constant , @xmath25 by the following manner : @xmath26 note that eqs .",
    "( [ phen1 ] ) and ( [ lep ] ) are valid also at finite temperature , hence , the final representation for the physical side can be written in terms of the temperature dependent mass and decay constant as : @xmath27    in qcd side , the correlation function is calculated in deep euclidean region , @xmath28 via ope where the short or perturbative and long distance or non - perturbative effects are separated , i.e. , @xmath29 the short distance contribution ( bare loop diagram in figure ( [ fig1 ] ) part ( a ) ) is calculated using the perturbation theory , whereas the long distance contributions ( diagrams shown in figure ( [ fig1 ] ) part ( b ) ) are represented in terms of the thermal expectation values of some operators . to proceed ,",
    "we write the perturbative part in terms of a dispersion integral , @xmath30 where , @xmath31 is called the spectral density at finite temperature .",
    "the thermal spectral density at fixed @xmath32 can be expressed as : @xmath33 to proceed , we need to know the fermion propagator at finite temperature .",
    "the thermal fermion propagator at real time is given as : @xmath34 here , @xmath35 is fermi distribution function , @xmath36^{-1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the above propagator , we find the following expression for the imaginary part of the correlation function at @xmath37 limit : @xmath38 where , @xmath39 . after some straightforward calculations ,",
    "the thermal spectral density is obtained as : @xmath40        in the non - perturbative part , the main contribution comes from the two gluon condensates since the heavy quark condensates are suppressed by inverse powers of the heavy quark mass and can be safely removed .",

    ", we should stress that the continuum threshold presented above is equal to the continuum threshold in vacuum at @xmath21 but it starts to diminish increasing the temperature such that at @xmath84 it reaches the perturbative qcd threshold , @xmath85 .",
    "this parametrization belongs to heavy - heavy system and differ considerably with the case of light - light and heavy - light quark systems , where the continuum threshold is related to the thermal light quark condensate ( for details see @xcite ) .",

    "present section is devoted to the numerical analysis of the sum rules for the mass and decay constant of the heavy scalar mesons . in further analysis ,",
    "we use @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 . the sum rules for the mass and decay constant also contain two auxiliary parameters , continuum threshold @xmath81 and borel mass parameter @xmath55 .",
    "the standard criteria in qcd sum rules is that the physical quantities should be independent of the auxiliary parameters .",
    "however , the continuum threshold @xmath95 is not completely arbitrary but is related to the energy of the first exited state with the same quantum numbers and can depend on the borel mass parameter @xcite .",
    "therefore , the standard criteria , does not render realistic errors , and in fact the existent error should be large .",
    "hence , we will add also the systematic errors to the numerical results .",
    "we choose the values @xmath96 and @xmath97 for the continuum threshold at @xmath98 and @xmath99 channels , respectively .",
    "the working region for the borel mass parameter is determined requiring that not only the higher state and continuum contributions are suppressed but also the contribution of the highest order operator should be small , i.e. , the sum rules for the mass and decay constant should converge . as a result of the above procedure",

    "these figures depict that the results depend very weakly on the values of the gluonic part of energy density , i.e. , both values obtained from lattice and chiral limit have approximately the same predictions in the interval , @xmath66 at which the lattice results are valid .",
    "these figures also show that the masses and decay constants do nt change up to @xmath2 but they start to diminish with increasing the temperature after this point . at near the critic or deconfinement temperature ,",
    "the decay constants reach approximately to 25% of their values in vacuum , while the masses are decreased about 6% and 23% for bottom and charm cases , respectively . from these figures",
    "we deduce the results on the decay constant and mass in vacuum as presented in tables i and ii .",
    "the quoted errors in these tables are due to the errors in variation of the continuum threshold , borel mass parameter and errors in other input parameters as well as the systematic uncertainties .",
    "table i also include a comparison of the decay constant of charm case with the existing predictions of the same framework or other nonperturvative approaches . from this table , we see that our predictions on the decay constant of the @xmath99 at zero temperature are well consistent with the predictions of qcd sum rules @xcite and cornell potential model @xcite predictions , but differ considerably from the result obtained in @xcite when the central values are considered . in table",
