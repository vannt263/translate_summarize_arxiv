    "rrecent developmernt on d - branes in string theories is owing in some part to the analysis of the boundary state @xcite .",
    "this ingredient is effective to describe boundary of string worldsheet , especially when it is studied in the ordinary parturbative approach of closed string conformal field theory .",
    "the boundary state itself has been developped to formulate string loop corrections to the effective equations of motion of string theory in relation to the fischler - susskind mechanism @xcite . in most of the studies of the boundary state ,",
    "only the constant gauge field strength was taken into account as the boundary degree of freedom .",
    "this is because in that case the boundary conditions satisfied by the coordinate fields on the worldsheet become linear , hence one can construct explicitly the eigen state of the equations of the boundary conditions .",
    "the d - brane @xcite opened new directions on the use of the boundary state .",
    "since this state specifies the couplings between d - brane dynamical degrees of freedom and closed string excitations , the state is useful for deriving d - brane actions , the effective actions of the d - branes @xcite .",
    "the d - brane actions have been indicative of various dualities in string theories @xcite .",
    "however , as mentioned above , these d - brane actions have been obtained in only the leading order estimation with respect to the derivatives acting on the fields on the d - branes .",
    "the derivative corrections may ruin the intriguing properties which the d - brane actions possess , and hence a systematic method for evaluating higher order corrections of the d - brane actions and the boundary states are needed @xcite .    in this paper , we extend our previous result of ref .",
    "@xcite to the superstring case .",
    "we construct in superstring theory a generalized boundary state which incorporates whole degrees of freedom of the boundary - coupled background fields , which are the gauge fields and the scalar fields on the d - brane .",
    "this boundary state is brst invariant and reduces to the previously known form when the field strength is put constant . using the boundary state",
    ", we can calculate particular terms in the d - brane action : the terms linear in closed string massless modes . by generalizing the boundary state ,",
    "we obtain corrections to the relevant part of the d - brane action . this method may give a gleam of hope to understand the string dualities to all order .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : gene ] , we obtain a supersymmetric extension of the generalized boundary state given in our previous paper @xcite in which in the bosonic string theory a boundary gauge field ( in particular , non - constant modes of the field strength ) was incorporated to the boundary state .",
    "we treat type ii superstring theory in this paper . after checking the brst invariance of the generalized boundary state , in sec .",
    "[ div ] we evaluate the divergence immanent in this state .",
    "the definition of the generalized boundary state includes products of the coordinate scalar field on a single worldsheet point , thus contains the normal - ordering divergence . in the evaluation of the divergence",
    ", we adopt the approximation of slowly - varying fields .",
    "this divergence is found to be identical to the superstring @xmath0 model loop divergence , hence the vanishing of the @xmath1 function in the string @xmath0 model corresponds to a well - defined boundary state with no divergence .",
    "then with use of this well - defined state we find that there is no finite correction to the d - brane action upto this order @xmath2 in the sector of the coupling linear in massless colsed string mode .",
    "this result is in contrast to the bosonic string case @xcite , in which the finite corrections exist . in sec .",
    "[ sec : higgs ] , utilizing t - duality transformation we introduce scalar fields into the boundary state , and see that there is no derivative correction to the d - brane action even with the scalar fields . in appendix",
    "a , we present detailed calculations which are necessary in sec .",
    "[ div ] . in appendix b",
    ", we apply our generalized boundary state to the bion configuration .",
    "we see that the `` spike '' part of the bion actually describes the stirng stuck to the d - brane .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , most aspects of the d - branes are concerning supersymmetry and their bps properties .",
    "hence the low energy effective actions of the d - branes are desirably studied in a supersymmetric fashion . in this section ,",
    "we apply the idea developped in our previous papar @xcite to superstring theory and construct a generalized supersymmetric boundary state , incorporating the non - constant gauge field strength on the d - brane .",
