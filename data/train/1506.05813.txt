    "the construction of exact analytic solutions to the einstein equations has had a long history , nearly one hundred years to be more precise .",
    "however , in spite of the fact that the total number of solutions is large  @xcite and growing , only a small subset of those solutions can be thought of as having any physical relevance .",
    "most solutions exhibit mathematical pathologies or violate simple principles of physics ( energy conditions , causality , etc . ) and are therefore not viable descriptions of any observable or potentially observable phenomena .",
    "indeed , works that review exact solutions and their properties demonstrate the difficulties associated with constructing solutions that might be relevant to gravitating systems that actually exist in our universe . even in the simplest case of exact analytic solutions for static , spherically symmetric fluid spheres",
    ", it has been shown that less than ten percent of the many known solutions can be considered as describing a realistic , observable object .",
    "for example , @xcite , using computer algebra methods , reviewed over 130 solutions and found that only nine could be classified as physically relevant  @xcite . a similar study by @xcite arrived at the same conclusion  @xcite .",
    "the latter review also introduced an additional criterion that further reduced the number of physically relevant solutions to those that have exact analytic equations of state ( eoss ) of the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the fluid pressure and @xmath3 is the matter density .",
    "this class of solutions was called `` the set of interesting solutions . ''    in 1939 @xcite introduced a technique for constructing solutions to the static , spherically symmetric einstein equations with material fluid sources  @xcite .",
    "that method led to eight exact analytic expressions for the metric functions , the matter density and in some cases the fluid pressure .",
    "beginning with an exact analytic solution for one of the two metric functions , an expression for the mass density could be obtained by integration . with expressions for the density and the first metric function in hand , an analytic expression for the second metric function",
    "could be obtained .",
    "this often required an appropriate change of the radial variable to obtain a simple integral .",
    "all functions could then be written as explicit functions of the radial coordinate @xmath4 while the fluid pressure could , in principle , be obtained from the metric and density functions , tolman chose not to evaluate the fluid pressure in some cases due to the fact that to do so would lead to mathematically rather complicated expressions that might be difficult to interpret .",
    "of the eight solutions presented in his paper , three were already known ( the einstein universe , the schwarzschild  de sitter solution , and the schwarzschild constant density solution ) ; most of the others `` describe situations which are frankly unphysical , and these do have a tendency to distract attention from the more useful ones . ''",
    "one , the so - called tolman  vii solution appeared to have some physical relevance , but this was one of the solutions for which no explicit expression for the pressure was given .    the tolman  vii solution has been rediscovered a number of times and has appeared under different names , the durgapal  @xcite and the @xcite solutions being two examples . that these solutions can be used to describe realistic physical systems has been noted by many authors , including those of the two review papers mentioned above  @xcite .",
    "it has been used as an exact analytic model for spherically symmetric stellar systems , and additional research has investigated its stability properties  @xcite . while these later works were able to obtain the complicated expressions for the fluid pressure as a function of the radial coordinate , according to finch and skea  @xcite it still was not one of the `` interesting solutions '' since it lacked an explicit expression for the equation of state . the choice of parameters that has been taken by different authors in order to completely specify the solution in many ways prevented the immediate interpretation of the physical conditions described by the solution .",
    "the reasons mentioned above are not sufficient to use or classify the tolman  vii solution as a physically viable one .",
    "instead , we seek physical motivations for the viability of this solution , and indeed we find these in many forms :    1 .",
    "[ lameemden ] from a newtonian point of view , simple thermodynamic arguments yield polytropes of the form @xmath5 ( here @xmath6 is the adiabatic index sometimes written in terms of the polytropic index @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is known at the adiabatic constant that can vary from star to star ) as viable models for neutron matter . when coupled with newtonian hydrodynamic stability and gravitation , the result is the lane - emden differential equation for the density profile , @xmath10 solutions of the latter , obtained numerically , or in particular cases @xmath11 or 1.2 ) exactly , all have a distinctive density falloff from the center to the edge of the newtonian star . this is a feature we wish physical solutions to have .",
    "furthermore , this distinctive falloff is quadratic in the rescaled radius  @xcite , suggesting that even in the relativistic case , such a falloff would be a good first approximation to model realistic stars , which have a proper thermodynamic grounding .",
    "[ schint ] looking at viable exact relativistic solutions to the einstein equations , the one used extensively before 1939 and even much later , was the schwarzschild interior solution .",
    "this solution has the feature that the density is constant throughout the sphere , and is not physical : the speed of sound ( pressure ) waves in its interior is infinite .",
    "however , this solution provides clear predictions about the maximum possible mass of relativistic stars in the form of the buchdahl limit  @xcite : @xmath12 the next best guess in this line of reasoning of finding limiting values from exact solutions would be to find an exact solution with a density profile that decreases with increasing radius , since a stability heuristic for stars demands that @xmath13 as expected from  [ lameemden ] in the newtonian case .",
    "extension to the relativistic lane - emden equation also requires  @xcite that @xmath14 a property tolman  vii has .",
    "[ falloff ] additionally , an extensive review  @xcite of most eoss used from nuclear physics to model neutron stars concluded that a quadratic falloff in the density is a very close approximation to _ most _ such nuclear models  the differences of drastically different nuclear models from tolman  vii being only minor if only the density profiles were compared .",
    "since tolman  vii is precisely the unique exact solution to the full einstein field equations that exhibits a quadratic falloff in the density profile , we believe that it captures much of what nuclear models have to say about the overall structure of relativistic stars .",
    "these three reasons taken together make a strong case for considering the tolman  vii solution as the best possible exact solution that is capable of describing a wide class of eoss for neutron stars . at the very least , it is as good a candidate that captures first - order effects in density of _ most _ nuclear model eoss , and at best it is the model that all realistic nuclear models tend to , while including features like self - boundedness naturally , as we shall show .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to reexamine the tolman  vii solution by introducing a set of constant parameters that we believe provide a more intuitive understanding of the physical content of the solution .",
    "in addition , the solution now becomes a member of the set of `` interesting solutions '' since we provide an explicit expression for a class of equations of state derived from the solution without any further assumptions about the matter , except for the newtonian - like , and physically motivated quadratic falloff of the density .",
    "the eoss will allow for further exploration of the predictions of the solution as well as a description of the material that makes up the star .",
    "the imposition of both the causality conditions where the speed of sound in the fluid never exceeds the speed of light and the different boundary conditions will provide further restrictions on the parameters associated with the solution .",
    "what this all leads to is a complete analytic model for compact stars that can be used to compare with recent observations of neutron star masses and radii . that the tolman  vii solution is consistent with all observations of astrophysical neutron stars leads to the conclusion that this exact solution is physically relevant while having features present in compact objects found in nature",
    "this article is divided as follows : following a brief historical introduction in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] , we re - derive the tolman  vii solution in sec .  [ sec : pressure ] , paying particular attention to the pressure expression with physically more intuitive variables .",
    "we then invert the density equation and use the pressure expression just found to derive a class of eoss in sec .",
    "[ sec : eos ] , where we also carry out an analysis of the said class of eoss . in the same section ,",
    "we contrast the two different types of physical models that the solution admits , and we shall also show how qualitative differences arise in the stars structure and quantitative ones appear in the predicted values of the adiabatic indices of the fluid . finally we provide some brief concluding remarks in sec .  [",
    "sec : conclusion ] .",
    "beginning with a line element in terms of standard areal ( schwarzschild ) coordinates for a static and spherically symmetric metric , @xmath15 the einstein equations for a perfect fluid source lead to three ordinary differential equations for the two metric variables @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and the two matter variables @xmath3 and @xmath2 . however , these variables will not be the most practical ones to carry out our analysis . instead two related metric functions , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are introduced , as prescribed in ivanov  @xcite .",
    "the reason for introducing these new metric variables is that with the assumption made for the density function , these variables will transform the original nonlinear differential equations into linear ones which may then be easily solved .    given the metric equation  , the einstein equations reduce to the following set of three coupled ordinary differential equations ( odes ) for the four variables @xmath20 and @xmath3 :    [ eq : einr ] @xmath21    where the primes @xmath22 denote differentiation with respect to @xmath23 and @xmath24 is equal to @xmath25 since in what follows natural units where @xmath26 are introduced .",
    "the first two equations   and   can be added together to generate the simpler equation@xmath27 which will be useful later on . in order to solve this set of odes ,",
    "one begins with equation   and assumes a specific functional form for the density , one that is motivated from physical considerations according to  [ falloff ] .",
    "since this is a linear inhomogeneous ode for @xmath28 one can for the appropriately chosen form of @xmath29 easily integrate this equation .",
    "the tolman vii density has a simple functional form : @xmath30,\\ ] ] where the constant @xmath31 represents the boundary radius as mentioned previously , @xmath32 represents the central density at @xmath33 and @xmath34 is a `` self - boundedness '' dimensionless parameter that spans values between 0 and 1 , so that when it is equal to 0 , we have a sphere of constant density , and when it is equal to 1 , we have a `` natural '' star , with density vanishing at the boundary .",
    "although very simple , this quadratic function is known to provide a good approximation for the density profile of a number of neutron star s eoss .",
    "for example , fig  5 in ref .",
    "@xcite plots the density profile of 12 eoss and compares them to a function of the form given in equation   ( for the @xmath35 case ) .",
    "therefore , the claim is that this functional form is a generic feature of many different types of nuclear eoss and this suggests that at the very least some global features of such a density profile might describe the bulk properties of many compact objects .",
    "the set of three parameters that describe the density function will occur frequently in what follows and will be denoted as : @xmath36 the form of the density function for @xmath37 is physically realistic , since it is monotonically decreasing from the center to the edge of the sphere , as argued previously in  [ schint ] and  [ falloff ] , in contrast to the constant - density exact solution frequently used to model such objects .",
    "additionally , boundary conditions are required for the system , since we eventually want to match this interior solution to an external metric . since the vacuum region is spherically symmetric and static , the only candidate by birkhoff s theorem is the schwarzschild exterior solution .",
    "the israel - darmois junction conditions for this system can then be shown to be equivalent to the following two conditions  @xcite :    [ eq : boundary1 + 2 ] @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the total mass of the sphere as seen by an outside observer , and @xmath40 is the mass function defined by @xmath41 furthermore , the requirement of regularity for the mass function , that it must vanish at the origin of the radial coordinate from physical considerations , leads to @xmath42 on imposing  , one immediately writes @xmath43 in terms of the parameters appearing in the density assumption : @xmath44 in contrast , tolman s method was to assume the second form for @xmath43 ( or equivalently for @xmath45 ) in  , and then obtain the density function from   directly by differentiation .",
    "the physical constants @xmath46 and @xmath47 occur frequently enough in the combinations shown above that the constants @xmath48 and @xmath49 as defined in   will be used when convenient .",
    "the solution methods for solving the odes obtained from the einstein equations , particularly those leading to the tolman  vii solution , have been given in multiple references  @xcite and will not be reproduced here .",
    "the complete tolman  vii solution is specified with the two functions   and   below , together with the previously given density function  , and the metric function @xmath43 in equation  : @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "the quantity @xmath52 is a new radial variable whose explicit expression in terms of @xmath53 is @xmath54 and it has been employed to simplify the expression of @xmath55    now that the full solution for the metric functions is known , the pressure can be computed through the relation  , obtained from a simple rearrangement and variable change of  : @xmath56 this substitution results in a very complicated - looking expression for the pressure ,    @xmath57 \\sqrt{1 - br^{2 } + ar^{4}}}{c_{1}\\cos{(\\phi\\xi ) } + c_{2 } \\sin{(\\phi\\xi ) } } } } - 4ar^{2 } + 2b - \\kappa \\rho_{c } \\left [ 1 - \\mu \\left ( { \\ensuremath{\\frac{r}{r_{b } } } } \\right)^{2 } \\right].\\ ] ]    so far the two integration constants @xmath58 and @xmath59 appearing in the expression for @xmath60 and therefore @xmath61 are completely arbitrary .",
    "application of the the boundary conditions using equations  ,  , and   leads to @xmath62 where @xmath63 is another radial coordinate , and all the @xmath49-subscripted variables are the values at the boundary @xmath64 the cancellation shown results from matching to the exterior schwarzschild solution .",
    "however , according to the second boundary condition  , the pressure has to vanish at the boundary ; therefore equation   simplifies to@xmath65 which can be further simplified and rearranged as @xmath66 since the ode , equation   for @xmath60 is second order , a second condition is required .",
    "this is simply going to be condition   restated as @xmath67 the two equations   and   constitute the complete cauchy s boundary condition on @xmath68 .",
    "the integration constants @xmath58 and @xmath59 can now be determined from the simultaneous equations : @xmath69 = \\alpha , \\\\   \\label{eq : bdysimul }    & \\therefore c_{2 } \\cos{(\\phi \\xi_{b } ) } - c_{1 } \\sin{(\\phi\\xi_{b } ) } = \\alpha / \\phi , \\\\",

    "\\label{eq : bdzsimul }   & \\therefore   c_{2 } \\sin{(\\phi\\xi_{b } ) } + c_{1 } \\cos{(\\phi \\xi_{b } ) } = \\gamma .",

    "an important quantity to consider ( since it establishes whether or not the solution is relativistically causal ) is the adiabatic speed of sound waves in the fluid .",
    "the usual definition of this quantity in perfect fluids is @xmath76 however , it will be convenient to find an expression for the sound speed directly from the differential equations , since the expression and functional form while completely equivalent is simpler to work with .",
    "first , from the expression for the density  , one obtains the derivative@xmath77 which is zero only at @xmath78 for the other equation , the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath79 reduces to @xmath80 in the @xmath81 case .",
    "these two expressions can be used to find @xmath82 for every value of @xmath53 but the center , so that @xmath83 using the expressions for all the terms in this formula , one obtains a relatively simple expression for the speed of sound .    the bulk modulus @xmath84 of a fluid is a measure of the resistance of a fluid to change its volume under an applied pressure . for perfect fluids it is related to the speed of sound in the media through @xmath85",
    "this is also a quantity which may be computed for the fluid in the interior .",
    "this calculation demonstrates that the order of magnitude of the bulk modulus is significantly higher than any currently known substance by many orders of magnitude .",
    "the next step to understanding this solution is to investigate the behavior of the solution as the parameter set is varied .",
    "the particular choice of parameters will be those that are associated with what one might expect for realistic compact astrophysical objects . as a result ,",
    "central densities @xmath86 will be typical .",
    "similarly , radii @xmath87 ( i.e. 10 km ) will often be used for the same reason . as stated above , the density profile   will decrease quadratically , and this provides a good approximation of what one would expect from a number of neutron star eoss .",
    "figure  [ fig : density ] plots the density as a function of radius for different values of @xmath88 which controls the relation of the surface density to the central density .",
    "the surface density ranges from a zero value when @xmath89 to increasingly higher densities as @xmath34 is decreased . in the literature",
    "@xcite , models having zero surface densities have been called `` natural , '' and those with nonvanishing surface densities have been called `` self - bound . ''",

    "both interpretations have been used , and sometimes even interchanged . however , each has a completely different content in that the first interpretation expresses how the pressure of the fluid changes in moving from the center of the star @xmath129 to the boundary @xmath130 while all the integration constants , and hence parameters @xmath75 are kept fixed .",
    "those seeking an interpretation of a unique eos that should be applicable to all neutron stars without exception would find this interpretation sufficient .",
    "the second interpretation , by contrast , looks closely at the fluid material itself and how the pressure at a certain point in the star changes as the density of the fluid at the center changes .",

    "at this point in the derivation , a causality condition has not been imposed upon expressions of eos1 or eos2 .",
    "therefore , the class of eos obtained can take a wide range of parameter values , as long as the metric functions and derived curvature tensors do not have singularities .",
    "the conditions leading to such singularities are narrower than the causality criterion , and enforcing the latter ensures that the parameter values do not cause singular behavior in the solution , and hence the class of eos .",

    "figure  [ fig : eosr ] which demonstrates how the eos changes under changes in the boundary radius , indicates that the adiabatic index @xmath6 is fixed over a large range of densities , but as expected the adiabatic constant @xmath9 is different for different stars . the self - boundedness parameter @xmath88 however , changes the character of this polytrope very much , as is clear in fig .",

    "one method often used to distinguish between different eos2 has been to calculate the compactness ratio , given by @xmath158 in the case of tolman  vii the values of @xmath156 for a large range of parameter variations @xmath128 are relatively constant .",
    "this means that even though we might change the value for @xmath128 of the stars , the ones bordering on causality share very similar compactness , albeit one that is lower than that previously thought possible .",

    "clearly the variation of @xmath156 is small ( 0.27 @xmath159 0.29 ) over a large range of values for @xmath34 ( 0.45 @xmath160 1.0 ) . a value for the maximal compactness of about 0.34 from rotational and causality criteria was obtained by ref .",
    "our analysis shows that @xmath156 is less than 0.3 for all possible stars , if tolman  vii is a valid physical model ( at least as a limit ) for stars .",
    "recently radius measurements of a limited number of neutron stars have been obtained  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : expt ] .",
    "we also superimpose a few of the limiting causal curves obtained for different values of @xmath34 from tolman  vii , to show that tolman  vii is not ruled out by observational results , even though it predicts lower compactness than most nuclear models .",

    "determine the relationship between the central density and the boundary of the star . a typical @xmath157-@xmath161 curve for a particular eos2 would be determined by fixing the parameters associated with a particular eos2 and then computing the mass as a function of the star s radius .",
    "all possible curves of this nature lie to the right of the curves shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : expt ] and thus any curves in that region represent a viable model for neutron star structure obtained from a tolman  vii solution .",
    "this is one advantage of having a complete analytic solution to the einstein equations . rather than integrate ( using numerical methods ) the tov equation for a specific set of eos parameters , an entire class of solutions are provided by the complete analytic expressions .",
    "physical constraints on the solution ( such as causality ) then provide restrictions on that class of solutions .",
    "what the curves shown in this plot represent are the maximum possible cases for the @xmath162 relation provided by the causal tolman  vii eos solutions .",
    "therefore , the whole space to the right of those lines can potentially yield a causal eos and thus fig .",
    "[ fig : expt ] shows that tolman  vii is not ruled out yet as a viable model for compact objects unless the radii of some of the neutron stars with known masses are so small that they would be represented by a point to the left of the curves .",
    "the lines shown are on the edge of causality in the following way : the speed of sound , a monotonically decreasing function of the radius , is just equal to the speed of light at the center where @xmath163 that is , the lines are the counterparts of those points that make up the surface of fig .

    "fig : phase ] .",
    "since all observations of compactness are bounded by the most extreme tolman  vii model , we claim that the solution may actually realized by compact stars in nature .",
    "a complete analysis of the tolman  vii solution has been carried out , and it was found that it is a physically valid solution with a huge potential for modeling physical objects .",
    "the class of eos this solution predicts has been found , and in certain regimes behaves very much like a polytrope with an adiabatic index of 2.5 , independently of the choices of two parameters : the central density and the radius of the star .",
    "the third parameter , the self - boundedness , changes the polytropic index drastically , particularly at the edge of the star , as expected from a naive newtonian approach to stellar structure . that this solution has a density profile that is very close to the hand - picked , but thermodynamically motivated polytropes of newtonian stars , while still being a full relativistic model is a very good reason to take its predictions of stellar structure seriously .",
    "it is also interesting that the type of matter that produces the different eoss depends crucially on the value of @xmath34 .",
    "hadronic matter is obtained with @xmath164 while @xmath136 stars would appear to be made up of quark matter .    using the eos derived from tolman  vii , we are able to compute the speed of pressure waves , and imposing causality on the latter results in a more restrictive limit on the maximum compactness of fluid spheres allowable by classical general relativity .",
    "this is possible to do without the use of numerical computations because of the exact form of the class of eoss generated by the quadratic density falloff assumption in tolman  vii .",
    "the solution is , moreover , stable under radial perturbations , since the speed of these pressure waves is finite and monotonically decreasing from the center outwards , thus satisfying the stability criterion in ref .",
    "if we believe as in ref .",
    "@xcite that tolman  vii is an upper limit on the possible energy density @xmath126 for a given mass @xmath165 some known models  @xcite which predict higher compactness than tolman  vii will have to be reconsidered , since they still maintain a quadratic density profile to first order , and thus can not also be causal at these higher compactnesses .",
