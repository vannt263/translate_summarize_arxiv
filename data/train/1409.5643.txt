    "all these effects are induced by changes in the electronic structure resulting from quantum confinement , such that energy levels are discretized in nanoparticles and single - electron subbands appears in nanowires .",

    "superconductivity is the tomasch effect ( te ) , which is a consequence of quasiparticle interference ( qpi ) due to scattering on a nonuniform energy - gap.@xcite the underlying process consists in a quasiparticle interacting with , and being condensed into , the sea of cooper pairs leaving behind a different but degenerate quasiparticle.@xcite as a result , tomasch oscillations appear as periodic oscillations in the density of states ( dos ) in superconducting junctions , at energies larger than the superconducting gap.@xcite these oscillations could be further enhanced when considering layered structures formed by intercalating successive metallic and superconducting regions . in this case",
    "the order parameter is by design non - homogeneous .",
    "theoretically , these oscillations were studied in multi - layer structures by using green s functions methods like gorkov equations.@xcite however , the electronic structure under te has not been unveiled because a fully self - consistent numerical calculation is required in order to obtain the coherence between quasiparticle states .",
    "qpis should also be observed in unconventional superconductors@xcite , where the interference should be more pronounced due to the intrinsic inhomogeneous nature of the superconducting order parameter .",

    "[ fig.1](a ) as a function of the width @xmath16 .",

    "[ fig.1](b ) , the spatial distribution of the order parameter , @xmath53 , is clearly enhanced for most of the x - values and shows strong wave - like oscillations .",
    "this enhancement is induced by quasiparticle states from the bottom of subband @xmath54 which have a large spectral weight as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig.1](c ) . for this narrow nanobelt ,",
    "only a few subbands ( @xmath55 ) contribute to the order parameter and are distinguishable from each other in fig .",
    "[ fig.1](c ) .    for a superconductor under quantum confinement and",
    "thus with inhomogeneous order parameter , a multi - gap structure was predicted.@xcite the energy gap @xmath56 of the subband @xmath57 is defined by the lowest energy of that subband . as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig.1](c ) , the energy gaps @xmath58 have almost the same value but are lower than @xmath59 .",
    "this feature can be seen clearly in the corresponding dos , in fig .",
    "[ fig.1](h ) , where three significant pairs of coherence peaks form around the fermi level .",
    "the lowest energy pair of peaks are less important and are due to the contributions of quasiparticles of subbands @xmath60 .",

    "[ fig.1](c ) .",
    "it is worth noting that these two pairs of peaks show electron - hole symmetry in the dos , whereas the third lowest pair of peaks do not .",
    "the latter ones are due to the contribution from states of subband @xmath54 around @xmath62 .",
    "the more significant peak in negative bias is due to : 1 ) a large number of hole quasiparticle states at the bottom of subband @xmath54 , and 2 ) the electron - hole coupling asymmetry due to the higher energy level where the bogoliubov quasiparticle states are formed by the larger weight of the hole component .",
    "this can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig.1](c ) where the spectral weight @xmath63 represents the color(shade ) of the lines .    in an isotropic superconductor ,",
    "bogoliubov quasiparticles are well defined only for energies close to the superconducting gap @xmath32 .",
    "for such states , the electron and hole components are of the same weight , which maximizes the amplitude of the pair amplitudes that generate the order parameter . with increasing energy ,",
    "bogoliubov quasiparticles decompose into dominant electron and hole components , accompanied by a dramatically decreasing pair amplitude .",
    "finally , they decompose into separate electron or hole quasiparticles belonging to the normal state .    for a conventional bogoliubov quasiparticle , which is well formed for energies near the gap",
    ", the electron and hole components belong always to the same subbands @xmath57 , i.e. @xmath64 coupling . as an example , we show more details of the lowest energy state @xmath65 of subband @xmath66 [ marked by an open circle in fig .",
    "[ fig.1](c ) ] in figs .  [ fig.1](f ) and ( g ) .",
    "the electron and hole amplitudes at @xmath67 , i.e. @xmath68 and @xmath69 , as a function of @xmath17 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.1](f ) .",
    "@xmath70 are shifted down for clarity .",
    "it can be seen that both components are in phase because they belong to the same subband @xmath66 .",
    "thus , the pair amplitude @xmath71 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.1](g ) as a function of @xmath17 , is always positive and shows a regular wave - like pattern with a constant envelope .",
    "we next discuss the influence of the te on the electronic structure .",
    "first , we find that energy gaps are unexpectedly opened between electron and hole quasiparticle states even well above the fermi level . as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig.1](c ) , the most pronounced energy gap above @xmath12 is generated by states @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( marked by open circles ) where subbands @xmath66 and @xmath74 were supposed to cross each other in case of a homogeneous superconductor . here , the states @xmath75 have the same k - value and they are chosen because they have the minimal gap @xmath76 between the two subbands , i.e. , @xmath77 .",
    "the energy of state @xmath72 is higher than the state of @xmath73 .",
    "as there are only two quasiparticles that take part in the qpi , we refer to this effect as the tomasch effect determined by two - subband quasiparticles interference processes .",
    "second , we find that particle - hole mixing ( bogoliubov quasiparticles ) is always significant for states under the influence of the te . this can be seen from the spectral weight of the related quasiparticle states in fig .",
    "[ fig.1](c ) .",
    "their color changes gradually for both the upper and lower energy bands that are associated with this gap .",
    "furthermore , the electron and hole wave - functions of the states under the te have a different structure because they belong to different subbands , @xmath57 and @xmath78 , i.e. @xmath79 coupling . to see this characteristic , we show electron and hole amplitudes at @xmath67 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , of the states @xmath75 as a function of @xmath17 in fig .",
    "[ fig.1](d ) .",
    "note that the amplitudes of the state @xmath73 are shifted down for clarity . for both states , @xmath75 ,",
    "the spectral weights of the electron components are the same as those of the hole components , which resembles the conventional bogoliubov quasiparticle state @xmath65 .",
    "however , their electron and hole wave - functions show a phase shift because the electron components , @xmath82 , belong to subband @xmath74 and the hole component , @xmath83 , to subband @xmath66 . this can be noticed by counting the numbers of nodes of the wave functions in fig .",
    "[ fig.1](d ) .",
    "the difference between these states is that @xmath72 is the bonding(symmetric ) combination of the electron and hole components while @xmath73 is the antibonding(anti - symmetric ) combination , i.e. , @xmath84 , as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig.1](d ) . as a result ,",
    "their pair amplitudes @xmath85 as a function of @xmath17 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.1](e ) are not positive - definite and exhibit a phase shift in space .",
    "third , the bogoliubov quasiparticle states under the influence of te do not directly affect the order parameter . as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig.1](e ) , the pair amplitudes @xmath85 are in anti - phase due to the nature of bonding and anti - bonding combinations .",
    "thus , their net pair amplitude @xmath86 almost cancels out as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.1](e ) .",
    "it is worth noting that , as proven in the next subsection , the net pair amplitude of these states have nothing to do with the te .",
    "this contribution is always positive , while the superconducting order parameter is weakly affected by te even if the energy of this avoided crossing is below the cutoff energy @xmath12 .",
    "fourth , te results in bcs - like pseudo - gaps in the dos , which are symmetrically located on both positive and negative bias .",
    "this is easy to understand because energy gaps are opened for the relevant crossing subbands where particle - hole mixing appears under the influence of the te .",
    "typically , the gaps induced by the te are smaller than the main superconducting gap .",
    "they will appear as pseudo - gaps because of the underlying background given by the other subbands which are not gapped .",
    "for example , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.1](h ) , the largest gap induced by te , @xmath76 is only about @xmath87{mev}$ ] .",
    "however , the effect of the gap resulting from the te can be seen more clearly from the enhanced peaks appearing at the gap edge when the bottom of one subband touches the top of the other subband . in fig .",
    "[ fig.1](h ) , the gap @xmath76 is surrounded by the peaks @xmath88 and @xmath89 in dos for negative bias and by @xmath90 and @xmath91 for positive bias .",
    "the generation of the two pair of peaks are similar to the @xmath92 , @xmath93 except that they result from the top of the hole - like subband @xmath66 and from the bottom of the electron - like subband @xmath74 .",
    "for the chosen width , there are more gap structures induced by te in the excitation spectrum [ see fig .",
    "[ fig.1](c ) ] and corresponding peaks in the dos [ see fig .",
    "[ fig.1](h ) ] . for example",
    ", the gap @xmath94 appears for the coupling of states from subbands @xmath95 and @xmath54 at @xmath96{mev}$ ] but its influence on the dos is weak .",
    "we also find other gaps such as @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "te is a common effect in inhomogeneous superconductivity and is strongly related to the symmetry , parity and structure of the order parameter . in the case of the clean limit , as we showed here , it is important to realize that avoided crossings exist only between electron and hole quasiparticle states of subbands @xmath57 and @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is an integer .",
    "this is because the order parameter has an even function with respect to @xmath67 .",
    "similarly , an odd - functional order parameter would result in te between states of subbands @xmath57 and @xmath102 . in the arbitrary situation where the order parameter shows a random distribution due to strong disorder",
    ", te should happen between all degenerate electron and hole quasiparticles .",
    "all these properties can be explained by a reduced @xmath3 bdg matrix as shown in the next subsection .      due to the fact that only two subbands are involved in the te of two - subband qpi , we find it can be qualitatively described by a reduced @xmath3 bdg matrix where only the two bogoliubov quasiparticles and their correlations are considered .",
    "we start from the general bdg equations ( [ bdg ] ) but only keep a hole state of subband @xmath57 and an electron state of subband @xmath78 for a given wave vector @xmath31 . for the hole state , its energy and wave function",
    "are determined by the single - electron schrdinger equation @xmath103 .",
    "note that @xmath104 due to the hole excitation .",
    "again , the energy and wave function of the electron state is determined by @xmath105 where @xmath106 .",
    "the orthogonal relation between the hole state @xmath107 and the electron state @xmath108 yields @xmath109 . for simplicity and fitting the case of previous subsection , @xmath107 and @xmath108 are chosen as real and to generate the real order parameter @xmath110 .",
    "then , the electron component of a bogoliubov quasiparticle is @xmath111 and the hole component is @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the component amplitude of subband @xmath57 for electron and hole , respectively .",
    "the @xmath3 bdg matrix reads : @xmath115 with the matrix elements @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "note that the @xmath118 is the exchange integral between the two states from different subbands . in a homogeneous superconductor , the constant order parameter @xmath119 leading to the zero exchange integral , @xmath120 , results in the decomposition of eqs .",
    "( [ bdg44 ] ) into two sets of general @xmath121 bdg matrices for the two states respectively .",
    "thus , there is no te for this case .    for an inhomogeneous superconductor with a perturbation in the order parameter @xmath122 , the matrix elements are @xmath123 and @xmath124 note that the non - zero exchange integral @xmath125 in this case is responsible for the te .",
    "the te of qpi reaches its maximum when states of two subbands are degenerate in energy , i.e. , @xmath126 .",
    "so eqs .  ( [ bdg44 ] )",
    "are written as @xmath127 the eigenvalues and eigenstates of matrix ( [ bdg44te ] ) are exactly solvable and the four eigenvalues are @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the quasiparticle excitation energy of the isotropic superconducting gap @xmath32 .",
    "the gap induced by te , @xmath130 , is the energy difference between the two positive eigenvalues : @xmath131    typically , the exchange integral @xmath118 is smaller than the excitation energy gap @xmath132 . as a result , @xmath133 and",
    "that is why we labeled the gaps as @xmath134 in fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] .    when the exchange integral is positive , i.e. , @xmath135 , the eigenvalues sorted by their values are @xmath136 and their corresponding eigenstates are @xmath137 where @xmath138 normalization is chosen to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ norm ] ) , i.e. @xmath139 . for both eigenstates with positive eigenvalue @xmath140 and @xmath141 , their spectral weights @xmath142 indicate that bogoliubov quasiparticles are well formed by the coupling between the electron and hole subbands .",
    "the difference between the two states are the bonding and anti - bonding combinations of the electron and hole components .",
    "it is interesting to realize that the @xmath143 and @xmath144 are @xmath118-independent and @xmath145 is the eigenstate of the positive eigenvalue of the general @xmath146 bdg equations , i.e. , @xmath147 where the eigen - energy is @xmath132 and the @xmath148 is introduced to satisfy the normalization condition , eq.([norm ] ) .",
    "it turns out that the total pair amplitude of the states @xmath140 and @xmath141 are the same as the one without te , i.e. , @xmath149    finally , we have to mention that the exchange integral @xmath118 is sensitive to the symmetry , parity and spatial variation of the order parameter @xmath110 . for the nanobelt in the clean limit , @xmath110 has a spatial distribution with even - parity with respect to @xmath67 .",
    "the exchange integral is exactly zero when both states @xmath107 and @xmath108 have different parity .",
    "this is the reason why te only appears between electron and hole quasiparticle states of subbands @xmath57 and @xmath100 which have the same parity , resulting in a possible non - zero exchange integral @xmath118 .       for a sample with @xmath150{nm}$ ] .",
    "note that the order parameter converges to @xmath52 in the bulk . ]",
    "previously , we introduced the properties of the te of two - subband qpis for a narrow sample .",
    "however , the mean field bdg theory is of limited validity in such a case due to the increasing importance of phase fluctuations and , moreover , quasiparticles are not well defined far above the fermi level . in this subsection , we investigate the te in wider samples in order to avoid these issues .",
    "the results of this subsection show that : 1 ) properties obtained previously are still valid , and 2 ) the te results in a modulated wave structure in the local density of states , which should be observable in experiments .        as an example",

    "the spatial distribution of the order parameter @xmath53 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.12 ] .",
    "it can be seen that the order parameter shows friedel - like oscillations at both edges but it converges to its bulk value @xmath52 far away from the edges .",
    "the flat order parameter in the central area suppresses the te .",
    "fortunately , the energy gaps induced by te can still be seen clearly in the corresponding quasiparticle excitation spectrum in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig.13 ] .",

    "a reduced @xmath3 bdg matrix can describe well the results . for a nanowire with a square cross section",
    ", the tomasch effect also results in three - subband quasiparticle interference processes due to the higher degree of symmetry .",
    "we observe coupling only for the symmetric combination of two hole states , while the anti - symmetric one remains unaffected .",
    "this leads to a unique energy band structure , where one of the subband crosses diagonally across the induced gap . for nanowires with rectangular cross section",
    ", the three - subband quasiparticles interference is converted into two sets of two - subband quasiparticles interference leading to a distortion of the previously unaffected band .    the tomasch effect is commonly formed in inhomogeneous superconductivity but it could be difficult to observe it experimentally .",
    "one reason is that the effect can be shadowed by other states present at the same energy .",
    "another reason is that the large size of cooper - pairs may result in a complex global electronic structure .",
    "however , the effect can be enhanced in the following ways : 1 ) by reducing the symmetry of the sample such as realized by surface roughness and by making layered junctions ; 2 ) by breaking the symmetry of the order parameter by e.g. disorder and impurities , and 3 ) by designing the sample such that the relevant electron and hole subbands touch each other near their bottom and top , respectively .",
    "we have show that for a realistic case , in the presence of weak disorder , the modifications in the dos due to the te survive and can be clearly distinguished from oscillations induced by impurity scattering .",

    "<S> the tomasch effect ( te ) is due to quasiparticle interference ( qpi ) as induced by a nonuniform superconducting order parameter , which results in oscillations in the density of states ( dos ) at energies above the superconducting gap . </S>",
    "<S> quantum confinement in nanoscale superconductors leads to an inhomogenerous distribution of the cooper - pair condensate , which , as we found , triggers the manifestation of a new te . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the electronic structure of nanoscale superconductors by solving the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations self - consistently and describe the te determined by two types of processes , involving two- or three- subband qpis . both types of qpis result in additional bcs - like bogoliubov - quasiparticles and bcs - like energy gaps leading to oscillations in the dos and modulated wave patterns in the local density of states . </S>",
    "<S> these effects are strongly related to the symmetries of the system . </S>",
    "<S> a reduced @xmath0 inter - subband bdg hamiltonian is established in order to describe analytically the te of two - subband qpis . </S>",
    "<S> our study is relevant to nanoscale superconductors , either nanowires or thin films , bose - einsten condensates and confined systems such as two - dimensional electron gas interface superconductivity . </S>"
