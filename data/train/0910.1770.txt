    "meanwhile , the discovery of the upsilon @xcite was completely unexpected , and increased the number of known fermion generations to three .    turning to the future , there are reasons to expect the next important particle physics discovery will be a neutral resonance .",
    "in addition to the well - motivated higgs boson @xcite of the standard model ( sm ) , there are many new resonances predicted by proposed extensions to the standard model .",
    "these extended theories can address unexplained features of the sm , such as : the lack of gauge unification and the hierarchy between the electroweak and planck scales ( through supersymmetry @xcite or the presence of extra dimensions @xcite ) ; and parity violation and light neutrino masses ( through an additional su(2)@xmath3 gauge symmetry @xcite , which has weak couplings to right - handed fermions ) .",

    "the violation of @xmath7-parity implies that the lightest sparticle is not stable , potentially removing it as a candidate for dark matter . however , if the lightest sparticle has sufficiently small couplings to give it a lifetime on the order of the age of the universe , it can still be a dark - matter candidate @xcite .",

    "however , the new @xmath6 boson could decay into the non - sm particles that are part of the 27 representation of e@xmath35 . if decay to all of these particles is possible , the @xmath6 boson width could be @xmath775% of its mass @xcite . even in this extreme case",
    ", the @xmath6 boson would appear as a narrow resonance .",
    "it has been suggested that the apparent difference between the scales of gravity and electroweak symmetry - breaking is due to the presence of at least one unobserved spatial dimension @xcite . the spread of the gravitational field into the extra dimension(s ) weakens the strength of gravity in the observed dimensions . closing the gap between the electroweak and planck scales requires either the number or the size of the extra dimensions to be large , if they are flat .",
    "recently , randall and sundrum have proposed a model that removes the scale hierarchy using one small extra dimension @xcite .",
    "this can be accomplished with a warped dimension separating the sm brane from the gravity brane , resulting in a metric of the form : @xmath78    where @xmath79 is the compactification radius , and @xmath80 and @xmath81 $ ] are the spacetime curvature and coordinate in the extra dimension , respectively .",
    "the curvature is of the order of @xmath82 , where @xmath83 gev is the planck scale on the 4-dimensional spacetime and @xmath84 is the newtonian gravitational constant . for a string theory with @xmath85(1 ) couplings , @xmath86 @xcite .    due to",
    "the spacetime warping , distances are exponentially larger on the gravity brane , resulting in a large gravitational field flux on this brane .",
    "the gravitational force for an observer on the sm brane appears as : @xmath87    where @xmath7 is the distance between masses @xmath88 and @xmath89 in the three large spatial dimensions .",

    ", the wave function of the massless graviton state is localized on the gravity brane and exponentially suppressed on the sm brane .",
    "graviton excitations are localized on the sm brane and are thus expected to have mases @xmath91 at the electroweak scale , @xmath92    where @xmath93 are @xmath94 roots of a bessel function and @xmath95 is of the order of the electroweak scale .",
    "the resonance width is proportional to @xmath96 , and is less than a few percent for @xmath97 .",
    "the most stringent direct limits on new neutral resonances come from searches at the tevatron .",
    "run ii searches at the cdf and d0 experiments have probed resonance decays to pairs of electrons @xcite , muons @xcite , taus @xcite , light quarks @xcite , top quarks @xcite , gluons @xcite , photons @xcite , and @xmath56 @xcite and @xmath2 @xcite bosons .",
    "the most sensitive searches use long - lived final - state particles , while other searches cover parameter space where couplings to long - lived particles are suppressed .",
    "searches for a resonance decaying to a pair of stable particles typically probe the reconstructed invariant mass distribution for evidence of a narrow peak , with the peak width determined primarily by detector resolution . because detector resolutions increase with increasing mass , the expected peak width also increases .",
    "this complication usually results in search windows that change as a function of mass , with the window causing some loss of acceptance .",
    "a recent cdf search @xcite uses templates to fit the full dimuon inverse invariant mass spectrum for new resonances , avoiding the acceptance loss from a search window .",
    "in addition , the inverse mass distribution has approximately constant resolution , simplifying the search .",
    "a complement to the invariant mass distribution is the angular distribution of the final - state particles , which can be used to separate a signal from the sm background and to determine the spin of the new resonance .",
    "cdf has performed a search in the dielectron final state using the @xmath98 distribution @xcite , where @xmath99 is the angle between the electron and the incoming quark in the boson rest frame @xcite .      currently , the cdf dimuon analysis of 2.3 fb@xmath100 of @xmath4 collision data is the most sensitive search for neutral resonances over most of the probed parameter space .",
    "the search uses a parametric simulation to model the detector response and resolution for muons , calibrated using known resonances . after normalizing the sm inverse mass spectrum to the @xmath2 boson peak ,",
    "the data are fit as functions of the number of new - neutral - resonance events above background and the resonance pole mass .",

    "the reconstructed tracks are constrained to originate from the time - averaged transverse beam collision coordinate , significantly improving momentum measurement resolution .",
    "calorimeters and a muon detector system at large radii from the beam line are used for muon identification and event triggering .    to minimize bias and optimize the detector resolution ( and thus the statistical significance of a narrow resonance ) , a detailed alignment of the cot is performed @xcite .",
    "the alignment uses cosmic - ray muons reconstructed as a single track through both sides of the nominal collision point @xcite .",
    "with 96 radial wire layers in the cot , any given two - sided track has up to 192 measurement points .",
    "the 96 layers are divided into 8 superlayers of 12 wires each , with each superlayer containing enough 2 cm wide cells to cover the azimuth .",
    "the first stage of the alignment allows a rotation and a shift of each cell , such that the mean residual of hits in any given cell is statistically consistent with zero ( with a precision of a few microns ) .",
    "after the individual cell alignment , a global correction to the wire shape between endplates is derived as a function of @xmath102 and radius .",
    "the shape is determined by the gravitational sag from the weight of the wire , and by the electrostatic deflection from the local electric field . the nominal correction to the wire shape due to these effects",
    "is further modified with an empirical correction function derived from measured biases between the two separately fit sides of the cosmic - ray tracks .",
    "a final correction to the track curvature is applied after the track reconstruction .",
    "the correction is derived from the difference in the ratio of calorimeter energy to track momentum for positrons and electrons , as functions of @xmath102 and @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "the momentum scale is calibrated by tuning the measured @xmath0 , @xmath104 , and @xmath2 boson masses to their precisely known values .",
    "individual hit resolutions of 150 microns are determined from the observed width of the @xmath105 peak , consistent with hit residuals of muons from @xmath2 boson decays .",
    "the transverse beam profile is modelled as a gaussian with a size set by the observed width of the @xmath106 mass peak measured with beam - constrained tracks .",
    "muon momenta transverse to the beam line are determined from a measurement of the reconstructed track curvature @xmath107 .",
    "the lorentz force @xmath108 causes a helical trajectory of the muon , resulting in a transverse momentum : @xmath109    where @xmath7 is the radius of curvature and @xmath58 is the magnitude of the magnetic field .",
    "the resolution on the track curvature ( @xmath110 at cdf ) can be derived from the individual hit resolutions .",

    "the partial derivative of the curvature with respect to the hit resolution @xmath116 is then @xmath117    for muons with small curvature ( large momentum ) , the resolution is effectively independent of curvature and improves with the square of the detector radius .    defining the reconstructed muon energies to be @xmath118 and @xmath119 , and their opening angle to be @xmath120 , the measured mass can be expressed as : @xmath121^{1/2}.\\ ] ]    the dominant contribution to the mass resolution comes from the momentum measurement , since the angular resolution is negligible by comparison .",
    "a high - mass resonance is predominantly produced with a relatively small transverse boost , resulting in muons with similar transverse momenta .",
    "then , @xmath122 , or @xmath123 .",
    "thus , a new narrow resonance would have an approximately constant width in the reconstructed @xmath124 distribution of central muons .",
    "the search in a constant - width variable simplifies the analysis .",
    "a distribution with uniform binning can be visually scanned for resonances .",
    "taking bin widths sufficiently narrow with respect to the resolution allows a template fit for a resonance centered on each bin , with the step size an equal fraction of the peak width throughout the distribution .",
    "this procedure optimizes the scan of the @xmath124 distribution .    at cdf ,",
    "the inverse mass resolution is 17% tev@xmath100 , with an additional contribution from multiple scattering at low mass . at 100 gev ,",
    "the total resolution is about 30% smaller than the intrinsic width of the @xmath2 boson .",
    "thus , the width of the new resonance could noticeably broaden the peak at low mass .",
    "however , the relative resolution increases linearly with increasing mass , while the relative instrinsic width remains constant , so for most resonances the detector resolution will dominate above a few hundred gev .    in the cdf analysis ,",
    "the search region is 35 bins of @xmath125 tev@xmath100 , resulting in an expected peak width of about 3 bins due to detector resolution .",

    "each probed inverse mass bin , a template of combined signal and background is compared to the data to determine the number of signal events that maximizes the log poisson likelihood .    the template fit adds acceptance outside of the usual mass window , particularly at masses near the kinematic threshold . while the template neglects interference between the new resonance and @xmath2 and @xmath126 bosons , any interference has a small effect on the search because the resonance is narrow and has a small cross section @xcite .",
    "dimuon production at a hadron collider occurs predominantly through the drell - yan process of @xmath127 production .",
    "this process has been calculated at next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) in @xmath128 @xcite and next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in @xmath129 @xcite at the tevatron , and is thus well understood theoretically . since the cdf analysis normalizes the background to the @xmath2 boson peak , the shape of the inverse mass distribution is the important theoretical input . over the probed mass region , the ratio of nnlo to leading order ( lo ) predictions have an @xmath130 variation .",
    "the difference between nlo and nnlo predictions is taken as a systematic uncertainty and increases from zero at 91 gev ( the normalization mass ) to 9% for a mass of 1 tev .",
    "a more important systematic uncertainty at 1 tev comes from uncertainties on the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) . at this mass , the valence ( anti-)quarks must have a large fraction of the ( anti-)proton s momentum . the uncertainty obtained from a comparison of cteq @xcite pdfs fit using lo and nlo inputs increases with mass to approximately 16% at 1 tev .",
    "no nlo @xmath129 correction is applied , and a 3% uncertainty at 1 tev is incorporated to cover its neglect .    a background relevant at high mass arises from hadrons decaying to muons in the cot , where the track is misreconstructed as a nearly straight line .",
    "the misreconstruction occurs via a track kink at the decay vertex or other incorrectly assigned hits in the inner superlayers .",

    "the angular distributions of the final - state particles included in the @xmath168-boson search at cdf have also been used by d0 to search for graviton production @xcite .",

    "this technique has been applied to higgs - boson and top - quark searches @xcite and measurements @xcite at the tevatron . for a high - mass resonance search , a modest gain in sensitivity is expected beyond a two - dimensional @xmath169 fit .",
    "we would like to recognize the tevatron accelerator division and the cdf and d0 collaborations , who have significantly extended the sensitivity to new neutral resonances over the past decade .",
