    "the field of quantum plasmas is a rapidly growing field of research . from the non - relativistic domain , with its basic description in terms of the schrdinger equation , to the strongly relativistic regime , with its natural connection to quantum field theory ,",
    "quantum plasma physics provides promises of highly interesting and important application , fundamental connections between different areas of science , as well as difficult challenges from a computational perspective .",
    "the necessity to thoroughly understand such plasmas motivates a reductive principle of research , for which we successively build more complex models based on previous results .",
    "the simplest lower order effect due to relativistic quantum mechanics is the introduction of spin , and as such thus provides a first step towards a partial description of relativistic quantum plasmas .",
    "already in the 1960 s , pines studied the excitation spectrum of quantum plasmas @xcite , for which we have a high density and a low temperature as compared to normal plasmas .",
    "in such systems , the finite width of the electron wave function makes quantum tunnelling effects crucial , leading to an altered dispersion relation .",
    "since the pioneering work by pines , a number or theoretical studies of quantum statistical properties of plasmas has been done ( see , _ e.g. _ , ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "for example , bezzerides & dubois presented a kinetic theory for the quantum electrodynamical properties of nonthermal plasmas @xcite , while hakim & heyvaerts presented a covariant wigner function approach for relativistic quantum plasmas @xcite .",
    "recently there has been an increased interest in the properties of quantum plasmas .",
    "the studies has been motivated by the development in nanostructured materials @xcite and quantum wells @xcite , the discovery of ultracold plasmas @xcite ( see ref .   for an experimental demonstration of quantum plasma oscillations in rydberg systems ) , astrophysical applications @xcite , or a general theoretical interest .",
    "moreover , it has recently been experimentally shown that quantum dispersive effects are important in inertial confinement plasmas @xcite .",
    "the list of quantum mechanical effects that can be included in a fluid picture includes the dispersive particle properties accounted for by the bohm potential @xcite , the zero temperature fermi pressure @xcite , spin properties @xcite as well as certain quantum electrodynamical effects @xcite . within such descriptions , @xcite",
    "quantum and classical collective effects can be described within a unified picture .",
    "the basic equation of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics is the schrdinger equation .",
    "the dynamics of an electron , represented by its wave function @xmath0 , in an external electromagnetic potential @xmath1 is governed by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is planck s constant , @xmath4 is the electron mass , and @xmath5 is the magnitude of the electron charge . this complex equation may be written as two real equations , writing @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the amplitude and @xmath8 the phase of the wave function , respectively @xcite .",
    "such a decomposition was presented by de broglie and bohm in order to understand the dynamics of the electron wave packet in terms of classical variables . using this decomposition in eq .",
    "( [ eq : schrodinger ] ) , we obtain @xmath9 and @xmath10 where the velocity is defined by @xmath11 .",
    "the last term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : schrod - mom ] ) is the gradient of the bohm  de broglie potential , and is due to the effect of wave function spreading , giving rise to a dispersive - like term .",
    "we also note the striking resemblance of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : schrod - cont ] ) and ( [ eq : schrod - mom ] ) to the classical fluid equations .      in relativistic quantum mechanics , the spin of the electron ( and positron )",
    "is rigorously introduced through the dirac hamiltonian @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath5 is the magnitude of the electron charge , @xmath14 is the speed of light , @xmath15 is the vector potential , @xmath1 is the electrostatic potential , and the relevant matrices are given by @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the unit @xmath18 matrix and @xmath19 , where we have the pauli spin matrices @xmath20 from the hamiltonian ( [ eq : dirac ] ) , a nonrelativistic counterpart may be obtained , taking the form @xmath21 thus , the electron possesses a magnetic moment @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the bohr magneton , giving a contribution @xmath24 to the energy .",
    "the latter shows the paramagnetic property of the electron , where the spin vector is anti - parallel to the magnetic field in order to minimize the energy of the magnetized system . according to ( [ eq : pauli - hamiltonian ] ) and the relation @xmath25 $ ] , where @xmath26 is some operator and @xmath27 $ ] is the poisson bracket , we have the following evolution equations for the position and momentum in the heisenberg picture @xcite @xmath28 @xmath29 while the spin evolution is given by @xmath30 where the spin operator is given by @xmath31 the above equations thus gives the quantum operator equivalents of the equations of motion for a classical particle , including the evolution of the spin in a magnetic field .",
    "the non - relativistic evolution of spin @xmath32 particles , as described by the two - component spinor @xmath33 , is given by the pauli equation ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ) @xmath34 \\psi = 0 , \\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the vector potential , @xmath23 is the bohr magneton , and @xmath35 is the pauli spin vector .",
    "now , in the same way as in the schrdinger case , we may decompose the electron wave function @xmath0 into its amplitude and phase .",
    "however , as the electron has spin , the wave function is now represented by a 2-spinor instead of a c - number .",
    "thus , we may use @xmath36 , where @xmath37 , normalized such that @xmath38 , now gives the spin part of the wave function . multiplying the pauli equation ( [ eq : pauli ] ) by @xmath39 , inserting the above wave function decomposition and taking the gradient of the resulting phase evolution equation",

    ", we see a significant increase in the complexity of the fluid like equations due the presence of spin .",
    "the fact that the spin couples linearly to the magnetic field makes the dynamical aspects of such pauli systems very rich .",
    "moreover , when going over to the collective regime , the back reaction through maxwell s equation can yield interesting new properties of such spin plasmas .",
    "in fact , the introduction of an intrinsic magnetization can give rise to linear instability regimes , much like the jeans instability ( see sec .  5.2 . ) .",
    "as pointed out in the previous section , the route from single wavefunction dynamics to collective effects introduces a new complexity into the system . at the classical level ,",
    "the ordinary pressure is such an effect . in the quantum case , a similar term , based on the thermal distribution of spins ,",
    "will be introduced .      the multistream model of classical plasmas",
    "was successfully introduced by dawson @xcite . here",
    "we will focus on the electrostatic interaction between a multistream quantum plasma described within the schrdiner model , a system first investigated in ref .",

    ", magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) has found applications in a vast range of fields , from solar physics and astrophysical dynamos , to fusion plasmas and dusty laboratory plasmas .",
    "magnetic fields , an essential component in the mhd description of plasmas , also couples directly to the spin of the electron .",
    "thus , the presence of spin alters the single electron dynamics , introducing a correction to the lorentz force term .",
    "indeed , from the experimental perspective , a certain interest has been directed towards the relation of spin properties to the classical theory of motion ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "in particular , the effects of strong fields on single particles with spin has attracted experimental interest in the laser community @xcite . however , the main objective of these studies was single particle dynamics , relevant for dilute laboratory systems , whereas our focus will be on collective effects",
    ".    we will now include if the ion species , which are assumed to be described by the classical equations and have charge @xmath111 , we may derive a set of one- fluid equations @xcite .",
    "the ion equations read @xmath112 and @xmath113 next we define the total mass density @xmath114 , the centre - of - mass fluid flow velocity @xmath115 , and the current density @xmath116 . using these denfinitions",

    "assuming quasi - neutrality , i.e.  @xmath118 , the momentum conservation equations ( [ eq : mom - pauli ] ) and ( [ eq : ion - mom ] ) give @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the tracefree pressure tensor in the centre - of - mass frame , and @xmath121 is the scalar pressure in the centre - of - mass frame .",
    "we also note that due to quasi - neutrality , we have @xmath122 and @xmath123 , and we can thus express the quantum terms in terms of the total mass density @xmath124 , the centre - of - mass fluid velocity @xmath125 , and the current @xmath109 . with this , the spin transport equation ( [ eq : spin ] ) reads @xmath126    in the momentum equation ( [ eq : mhd - mom ] ) , neglecting the pressure and the bohm  de broglie potential for the sake of clarity , we have the force density @xmath127 . in general , for a magnetized medium with magnetization density @xmath128 , ampre s law gives the free current in a finite volume @xmath129 according to @xmath130 where we have neglected the displacement current .",
    "the surface current is an important part of the total current when we are interested in the forces on a finite volume , as was demonstrated in ref .   and will be shown below .",
    "it it worth noting that the expression of the force density in the momentum conservation equation can , to lowest order in the spin , be derived on general macroscopic grounds .",
    "formally , the total force density on a volume element @xmath129 is defined as @xmath131 , where @xmath132 are the different forces acting on the volume element , and might include surface forces as well . for magnetized matter ,",
    "the total force on an element of volume @xmath129 is then @xmath133 where ( neglecting the displacement current ) @xmath134 . inserting the expression for the total current into the volume integral and using the divergence theorem on the surface integral",
    ", we obtain the force density @xmath135 identical to the lowest order description from the pauli equation ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : mhd - mom ] ) ) . inserting the free current expression ( [ eq : free - current ] ) , due to ampre s law , we can write the total force density according to @xmath136 the first gradient term in eq .  ( [ eq : total - force ] ) can be interpreted as the force due to a potential ( the energy of the magnetic field and the magnetization vector in that field ) , while the second divergence term is the anisotropic magnetic pressure effect . noting that the spatial part of the stress tensor takes the form @xcite @xmath137 we see that the total force density on the magnetized fluid element can be written @xmath138 , as expected .",
    "thus , the pauli theory results in the same type of conservation laws as the macroscopic theory . the momentum conservation equation ( [ eq : mhd - mom ] )",
    "then reads @xmath139 where for the sake of clarity we have assumed an isotropic pressure , dropped the displacement current term in accordance with the nonrelativistic assumption , and neglected the bohm potential ( these terms can of course simply be added to ( [ eq : mhd - mom2 ] ) ) .",
    "this concludes the discussion of the spin - mhd plasma case .",
    "next , we will look at some applications of the derived equations .",
    "however , it should be noted that in many cases the spins are close to thermodynamic equilibrium , and we can thus write the paramagnetic electron response in terms of the magnetization @xcite @xmath140 instead of using the full spin dynamics . here",
    "@xmath141 denotes the magnitude of the magnetic field and @xmath142 is a unit vector in the direction of the magnetic field , @xmath143 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath144 is the electron temperature .",
    "the above equations are quite complicated , but as such also extremely rich .",
    "suitable and physically relevant approximations , such as the magnetization given by the expression ( [ eq : tanh - factor ] ) , will however lead to considerable simplifications .",
    "below we consider two specific examples where such simplifying assumptions lead to interesting spin effects .      in ref .",
    ", it was shown that the electron spin can introduce novel nonlinear structures in plasmas , with no limiting classical counterpart .",
    "in particular , the mhd limit for a _ electron - positron pair plasma _ is considered .",
    "neglecting dissipative effect , the governing equations for the system of interest read @xmath145 @xmath146 where @xmath147\\bm{\\mathsf{i}}+(m^{2}/\\rho ) % \\mathbf{j}\\otimes \\mathbf{j}$ ] is the total pressure tensor in the centre - of - mass frame and @xmath148 where we have assumed equal temperature @xmath144 of the electrons and positrons .",
    "moreover , we have @xmath149 while the current is given by @xmath150 \\label{eq : ampere - ohm}\\ ] ] for one - dimensional alfvn waves , the above system can be reduces to the modified korteweg - de vries equation@xcite @xmath151    v_{y }    = - \\frac{(\\mu _ { b}b_{0})^2}{2m_ek_bt}\\frac{v_{y}^{2}}{%    c_{a}^{3}}\\frac{\\partial v_{y}}{\\partial \\xi }   \\label{eq : alf - nl2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath152 ^{1/2}$ ] is the alfvn speed , @xmath153 is the spin - modified alfvn speed , @xmath154 is the cyclotron frequency , @xmath155 is the magnitude of the unperturbed magnetic field , @xmath156 is the unperturbed density , and we have the spatial coordinate @xmath157 .",
    "we see that neglecting the spin contribution leads to a purely dispersive equations .",

    "we stress that @xmath180 , which to some extent can be considered as an effective acoustic velocity , may be imaginary for a strongly magnetized plasma due to the spin contribution , a fact which will be explored in some detail below .",
    "we consider propagation perpendicular to the external magnetic field , which is the geometry which leads to instability most easily .",

( [ eq : general - dr ] ) reduces to @xmath182 ^{1/2 }   \\label{eq : instability - dr } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the necessary and sufficient instability condition can thus be written as @xmath183 where the total pressure @xmath184 consists of the effective spin pressure @xmath185 , which is the only negative pressure term and therefore the source of the instability , the magnetic pressure @xmath186 $ ] , and the particle pressure @xmath187 , containing both the thermal and fermi pressure part .",
    "thus , a plasma can contain a magnetization instability , much like the gravitationally induced jeans instability @xcite .",
    "we have seen that quantum effects , and in particular the electron spin , can introduce new and interesting aspects in plasma theory and experiments .",
    "it is expected that the rapid development of quantum plasma theory will be fueled by recent experiments ( see , _",
