    "the mechanism of strangeness production in nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath3 ) reactions is still an open problem . in 1960",
    "ferarri  @xcite was the first to propose kaon and pion exchanges as a mechanism for strangeness production in @xmath3 reactions .",
    "it is obvious that one can extend this approach by incorporating other nonstrange mesons , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 as well as the known strange mesons , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in particular , the @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath7 mesons are expected to give large contributions because recent experimental data show that they couple strongly to several baryonic resonances ( @xmath12 ) which have sizeable decay branches to a hyperon ( @xmath13 ) and a kaon ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "this is especially apparent in the case of @xmath14 reactions  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , among the different meson exchanges the @xmath9-meson exchange is of fundamental interest because the kaon - nucleon - hyperon coupling constant , @xmath15 , is related to the strength for @xmath16-pair creation at the @xmath17 vertex . however , as was found in several studies  @xcite , it is not easy to separate the contributions from strange and nonstrange meson exchanges on the basis of the available data .",
    "it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that to reproduce the available experimental data the kaon exchange may not be necessary .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we proposed a possibility to distinguish the dominant meson exchanges in the strangeness production , @xmath18 , experimentally by reconstructing the invariant mass distribution for the @xmath19 system .",
    "it was found that the strangeness production in the @xmath20 reaction could be understood in terms of nonstrange meson exchanges followed by the excitation of an intermediate baryon resonance , @xmath12 , which decays to a @xmath21 and kaon .",
    "thus , the @xmath22 invariant mass spectrum is a promising way to understand the structure of strangeness production especially with respect to baryonic resonance excitation .",
    "furthermore , we note that at low energies strange meson exchange provides almost the same invariant mass spectrum as an isotropic phase - space distribution for the hyperon - kaon system in the final state .",
    "therefore , there is the possibility to distinguish the kaon exchange contributions from @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath7-meson exchanges , which deviate from isotropic distributions , if they lead to strong baryonic resonance excitations .",
    "recently , the tof collaboration from the cooler synchrotron , cosy - jlich , reported on experimental data for the @xmath19 invariant mass spectrum  @xcite .",
    "they observe deviations from an isotropic phase space distribution and are close to the predicted spectrum  @xcite . obviously , to obtain further insight into the strangeness production mechanism , it is crucial to collect more statistics and also to achieve a better mass resolution for the @xmath19 system .",
    "on the other hand , the observation in ref .",
    "@xcite can be considered as a first experimental indication for the excitation of an intermediate baryonic resonance coupled to the @xmath19 system in the @xmath0 reaction .    in this study",
    "we calculate the @xmath1 reaction within the same one - meson exchange model used in refs .",
    "@xcite , which includes @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath7-meson exchanges followed by intermediate state resonance excitations .",
    "as is commonly believed , the kaon exchange contribution to @xmath23 production in the @xmath3 reaction is almost negligible due to the small @xmath24 coupling constant ( cf .",
    "thus we expect the signal due to resonance excitations in the @xmath23 channel in @xmath3 reactions , @xmath25 , to be much cleaner than in the @xmath21 production channel .",
    "furthermore , in case of the @xmath0 reaction there are a few resonances which contribute and therefore smear out the invariant mass distribution for the @xmath19 system . on the other hand , as will be shown later , the situation for @xmath23 production is much better because the dominant contribution mainly should stem from the @xmath26 resonance .",
    "the feynman diagrams relevant for the @xmath1 reaction are shown in fig .",
    "[ kn0 ] . here",
    "@xmath12 denotes a baryonic resonance which couples to the @xmath2 channel , while @xmath27 denotes the exchanged meson ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 or @xmath7 ) .",
    "the mesons are restricted to those which are observed in the decay channels of the resonances considered .",
    "since we only take into account those resonances which are experimentally known to decay to a @xmath23 and kaon , and also the branching ratios to the @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 modes are experimentally measured , all the relevant coupling constants at the @xmath31 and @xmath32 vertices can be determined from the measured partial widths .",
    "the data for the resonances included in the model are summarized in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "note that some of the data have been modified in ref .",
    "the @xmath33 resonance in the model is treated as an effective resonance which represents the contributions from six individual resonances , i.e. @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath33 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 in line with ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    ".[tab2 ] the properties of the baryonic resonances included in the model .",
    "confidence levels of the resonances are , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41  @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this section we analyze the contributions from different meson exchanges and the sensitivity to the model parameters .    from a first look at the coupling constants listed in table  [ tab3 ]",
    "one expects that the dominant contribution for the @xmath1 reaction should come from the @xmath26 or @xmath42 resonance .",
    "the @xmath43 coupling constant is one order of magnitude larger than @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "although the @xmath46 coupling constant is larger than @xmath47 , it is compensated by the small value for @xmath44 coupling constant .",
    "the actual calculated results support this simple estimate .    in fig .",
    "[ kn4 ] we show the decomposition of the contributions from each resonance to the energy dependence of the @xmath48 total cross section , plotted as a function of the excess energy @xmath49 .",
    "the calculations were performed without including the @xmath50 final state interaction ( fsi ) , which is expected to be important at energies very close to threshold  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the results shown in fig .  [ kn4 ] confirm the expectation that the dominant contribution comes from the @xmath42 resonance .",
    "in addition , the contribution from the @xmath51 baryonic resonance is almost negligible .",
    "next , we analyze the contributions from the different meson exchanges .",
    "it is not straightforward to estimate , which meson exchange gives a dominant contribution to the @xmath2 production in nucleon - nucleon collisions by just looking at the data in table  [ tab3 ] .",
    "we , therefore , show in fig .",
    "[ kn1 ] the separate contributions from @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath7-meson exchanges to the energy dependence of the @xmath48 and @xmath52 total cross sections .",
    "we find that the contributions from @xmath4 and @xmath5 exchange are important at low energies , while the @xmath7-meson exchange contribution dominates at excess energies @xmath53 above 1  gev .",
    "a crucial question is the sensitivity of the results to the coupling constants and cut - off parameters which can not be fixed solely from the experimental data within the model .",
    "the situation for the @xmath4-meson exchange is rather clear ; the coupling constant and the form factor at the @xmath54 vertex are well under control from the study of @xmath3 interactions . in addition , according to the investigations of the @xmath55 reactions  @xcite , the @xmath56 and @xmath57 vertices are fixed consistently by the existing experimental data .",
    "[ kn14 ] shows a comparison between the model calculations and the data on @xmath55 cross sections . with the set of the parameters listed in tab .",
    "[ tab2 ] the model reasonably reproduces the different reaction channels : @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the situation for the @xmath5-meson exchange is less obvious . since the contribution from @xmath5-exchange is important at low energies ( cf .",
    "[ kn1 ] ) , we have to discuss the status of the @xmath62 coupling constant in more detail .",
    "as reviewed by tiator , benhold and kamalov  @xcite , the @xmath62 coupling constant has still large uncertainties .",
    "the values for @xmath63 vary between 1 and 9 and depend substantially on the model applied to describe the data .",
    "furthermore , the experimental data themselves have large uncertainties and do not allow to extract a precise value for @xmath63 .",
    "when using the one - boson exchange potential to fit the nucleon - nucleon phase shifts  @xcite one requires @xmath64 .",
    "however , the analysis itself is not sensitive enough to the @xmath5-meson exchange . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath65 data restrict the value to be small , @xmath66  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a fit to the total cross section for the @xmath67 reaction requires @xmath68 in the case of pseudoscalar coupling and @xmath69 for pseudovector coupling  @xcite . thus the total cross section is not sensitive enough to evaluate the coupling constant .",
    "however , the authors of ref .  @xcite suggest a value , @xmath70 , which is extracted from the description of the angular distribution .",
    "a global analysis of both meson scattering and photon induced reactions on the nucleon , performed recently by feuster and mosel  @xcite , yields a value @xmath71 .",
    "based on su(3 ) symmetry the @xmath63 coupling constant is related to the @xmath72 as  @xcite @xmath73 with @xmath74 when combined with the su(6 ) quark model ; this value for @xmath75 gives @xmath76 .    in our calculation",
    "we use the value @xmath77 taken from the bonn @xmath3 potential model  @xcite . considering the uncertainty discussed above for the @xmath62 coupling constant ,",
    "we have investigated how the calculated results are affected by varying the value for @xmath63 .",
    "the deviations due to the different values for @xmath63 for the contribution from the @xmath5-exchange ( shown in fig .",
    "[ kn1 ] for @xmath77 ) then vary by factors of 1/60 to 1.3 , respectively .",
    "in addition , there are also uncertainties in the resonance properties . the latest issue of the review of particle data  @xcite no longer lists the branching ratios for the @xmath78 and @xmath79 channels .",
    "thus , the coupling constants @xmath80 and @xmath47 also involve uncertainties on the present experimental confidence level .",
    "a similar situation also holds for the @xmath81 resonance .",
    "note , however , that the @xmath7 couplings have been already fixed by our previous study on @xmath21-hyperon production in @xmath3 collisions  @xcite .",
    "the data for @xmath1 reactions are available at excess energies larger than 300  mev . in fig .",
    "[ kn9 ] we show the calculated energy dependence of the total cross sections for the @xmath52 , @xmath48 and @xmath82 reactions ( solid lines ) in comparison with the experimental data ( dots ) from ref .",
    "our model reproduces all these reaction channels reasonably well with the same set of parameters .    however , the situation is different for the @xmath83 and @xmath84 reactions .",
    "the energy dependence of the total cross sections for these reactions is shown in fig .",
    "[ kn10 ] ; here our calculations ( solid lines ) substantially overestimate the experimental data ( full dots ) from ref .",
    "@xcite . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ kn1 ] , at excess energies above 1  gev the dominant contribution stems from @xmath7-meson exchange according to our model .",
    "this phenomenon is shown in fig .",
    "[ kn11 ] , where the meson exchange contributions are displayed separately .",
    "this implies that almost all available data for the @xmath1 reaction are dominantly governed by the parameters for @xmath7-exchange , while the model parameters , together with those for @xmath7-exchange , have been fixed to reproduce optimally the existing total cross section data for the @xmath0 and @xmath85 reactions at excess energies around 1 gev .",
    "thus the data for the @xmath86 reaction at excess energies larger than 1 gev clearly indicate the limitations of our model .",
    "nevertheless , we may check the consistency of the data . for this purpose",
    "we show the ratios of the total cross sections for the @xmath84 to @xmath52 both for the experimental data ( full dots with error bars ) and the calculated results ( solid line ) in fig .",
    "[ kn12 ] . in a simple one - boson exchange picture ( tree - level ) ,",
    "only neutral mesons can be exchanged in the @xmath52 reaction , while both neutral and charged mesons can be exchanged in the @xmath84 reaction .",
    "furthermore , the isospin factor for charged meson exchange at the meson - nucleon - nucleon vertex is a factor of @xmath87 larger than that for the neutral meson .",
    "if we neglect the small contribution from @xmath5 exchange as in fig .",
    "[ kn11 ] , our explicit calculation shows that the direct amplitudes for @xmath4 and @xmath7 exchange followed by @xmath26 and @xmath81 resonance excitation , give a factor of two larger contributions to the @xmath84 reaction relative to those for the @xmath52 reaction .",
    "thus , we may naively expect that the total cross section for the @xmath84 reaction should be larger than that for @xmath52 .    however , the ratios for the experimental data in fig .",
    "[ kn12 ] ( the dots ) clearly contradict this expectation ; the ratios become even smaller than one .",
    "the calculated results ( solid line ) reasonably agree with the simple estimate made above .",
    "we note that the available data for the @xmath88 production in @xmath89 collisions collected in ref .",
    "@xcite were obtained by the group of ansorge et al .",
    "@xcite alone .",
    "the data were taken with a neutron beam and the cern 2  m hydrogen bubble chamber ; the systematic uncertainty due to the beam normalization @xmath9013% is not shown in our figures .",
    "thus , we would like to urge experimental collegues to collect more data for the @xmath91 reaction in order to resolve this systematic discrepancy .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ kn2 ] we show the @xmath48 total cross section for a larger scale of excess energies , as relevant for cosy , such that one can examine the effect of final state interactions in more detail .",
    "note , that our calculations were performed without the inclusion of fsi .",
    "thus we expect that the present results should deviate from the experimental data at small excess energies .",
    "deviations of our calculation  @xcite from the data  @xcite at excess energies @xmath92  mev have been also noticed for the @xmath0 reaction .",
    "it was argued both experimentally  @xcite and theoretically  @xcite , that at energies very close to the reaction threshold the production mechanism is strongly distorted by the final state interaction between the hyperon and the nucleon .",
    "one of the common ways  @xcite to account for fsi is using the watson - migdal theorem  @xcite , which expresses the total reaction amplitude as a product of the production amplitude and the on mass - shell @xmath93 scattering amplitude .",
    "however , this approach was recently criticized by hanhart and nakayama  @xcite focussing on the on - shell treatment and factorization of the reaction amplitude .",
    "it was also suggested by meiner  @xcite that the treatment of fsi might be too simplistic in the watson - migdal scheme .",
    "in addition , we note that the knowledge of the @xmath94 scattering amplitudes is still unsatisfactory .",
    "although there have been extensive theoretical studies of the hyperon - nucleon interaction  @xcite , the @xmath94 interaction models from nijmegen  @xcite and jlich  @xcite predict completely different results for the @xmath95 reaction as recently shown by parreno et al .",
    "this implies that the introduction of fsi corrections in the calculation is strongly model dependent even within the on mass - shell watson - migdal approximation .",
    "the situation is even more complicated  @xcite because the @xmath96 channel coupling becomes stronger at energies close to the threshold .",
    "it is therefore not so easy to improve the @xmath20 calculations near threshold by taking into account fsi corrections in an unambiguous manner , as compared to the treatment proposed in ref .  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "we discard the explicit calculation of fsi corrections and rather concentrate our study on excess energies larger than 40  mev , where fsi and the @xmath96 channel coupling are expected to be small .",
    "to obtain insight into the dynamics of hyperon production in @xmath3 collisions we demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that the invariant mass spectrum for the @xmath19 system indeed provides a clue to the @xmath21 production mechanism .",
    "the situation also holds true for the @xmath1 reaction .",
    "if the @xmath1 reaction proceeds through the excitation of baryonic resonances one might observe a characteristic distribution for the @xmath2 invariant mass , which reflects the excitation of the intermediate baryonic resonance .",
    "as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite the invariant mass distribution for the hyperon - nucleon system extends to the upper limit of @xmath97 and , thus , depends on the excess energy @xmath53 . since the typical widths of the baryonic resonances ( cf .",
    "table  [ tab2 ] ) range from 100 to 200  mev , the distribution may be affected by intermediate baryonic resonance excitations for @xmath98  mev ( half width of 200  mev ) .",
    "this also implies that the invariant mass spectrum at energies near the reaction threshold , i.e. , small excess energies , will not show a clear signal of the baryonic resonance excitation .",
    "since the invariant mass distribution ranges from the threshold energy to the threshold energy plus excess energy , the shape of the invariant mass distribution can not be affected noticeably if the excess energy is smaller than the resonance width .    in fig .",
    "[ kn5 ] we show the @xmath2 invariant mass distribution for the @xmath48 reaction calculated at an excess energy of 100  mev .",
    "the dashed histogram is the sum of the contributions from the @xmath81 and @xmath99 resonances , while the solid histogram corresponds to the total sum of contributions from the @xmath26 , @xmath81 and @xmath99 resonances .",
    "it is clear that the dominant contribution comes from the @xmath26 . for comparison",
    ", we also show the phase space distribution normalized to the same total cross section ( solid line ) . at this excess energy",
    "the deviation from the phase - space distribution due to resonance excitations is already noticeable .    in fig .",
    "[ kn6 ] we show again the @xmath2 invariant mass distribution for the @xmath48 reaction , but at an excess energy @xmath100200  mev .",
    "the solid histogram is the sum of the contributions from all the resonances , @xmath26 , @xmath81 and @xmath33 , while the solid line is the phase - space distribution normalized to the same total cross section . at this excess energy",
    "the deviation from the phase - space distribution becomes more pronounced and the signal from the @xmath26 excitation can be detected at the peak position of the @xmath88 invariant mass , @xmath101  gev .",
    "recall , that the contributions from the other resonances are small .    as was proposed by the cosy-11  @xcite and tof-  @xcite collaborations a more precise analysis can be performed in terms of a dalitz plot to understand the @xmath2 production mechanism . in fig .",
    "[ kn7 ] we show the dalitz plot calculated for the @xmath48 reaction at the excess energy @xmath100100  mev ; i.e. the @xmath50 invariant mass versus the @xmath2 invariant mass . in fig .",
    "[ kn7 ] the larger squares denote a higher density of the invariant mass distribution .",
    "in case of strong final state interactions between the @xmath23 and nucleon one would expect an enhancement in the lower region of the @xmath50 invariant mass . according to the hyperon - nucleon potential models of the nijmegen  @xcite and jlich  @xcite groups",
    "the hyperon - nucleon interaction becomes very strong at the @xmath50 invariant mass below @xmath902.17  gev .",
    "thus , fsi can substantially distort the @xmath26 signal .",
    "indeed , fig .",
    "[ kn7 ] illustrates that there is a structure around @xmath102  gev , but this is due to the contribution from the @xmath26 resonance which overlaps with the @xmath103 region , where the influence of fsi might be substantial ( cf .",
    "[ kn5 ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ kn8 ] we show the dalitz plot for the @xmath48 reaction at an excess energy @xmath104  mev .",
    "the situation is much clearer than in the case @xmath105  mev , shown in fig .",
    "[ kn7 ] , since the structure due to the @xmath26 resonance is well separated from the lower range of @xmath50 invariant mass .",
    "thus , we expect that the dalitz plots for the @xmath106 and @xmath103 invariant masses should be a very useful tool for understanding the dynamics of the @xmath1 reaction .",
    "within a simple model of one - boson exchange followed by baryonic resonance excitation we have investigated the @xmath1 reactions .",
    "our model includes only those mesons which are observed to couple to the baryonic resonances which themselves are known to decay to a @xmath23-hyperon and @xmath9-meson .",
    "thus only the nonstrange meson exchanges ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath7 ) were taken into account .",
    "we demonstrated that our model could reproduce reasonably well the available total cross section data for the @xmath85 reaction , while it overestimated systematically the data for the channel @xmath91 at higher energy . concerning the experimental data for the @xmath91 reaction , we investigated the data consistency in terms of a simple isospin model using the one - boson exchange picture .",
    "we demonstrated , that it is essential to have new experimental data on neutron induced @xmath23 production .",
    "we also showed that the @xmath2 invariant mass spectrum provides a powerful method to understand the @xmath1 reaction mechanism . in the present approach",
    "the dominant contribution to @xmath1 reactions comes from the @xmath26 resonance and it substantially affects the @xmath2 invariant mass distribution .",
    "our results suggest that the signal due to the @xmath26 resonance excitation can be detected experimentally at excess energies around 100  mev .",
    "finally , we analyzed the dalitz plot based on our calculations and presented the distribution of the @xmath50 invariant mass versus the @xmath2 invariant mass .",
    "this analysis shows a characteristic structure due to the @xmath26 resonance that can be well distinguished from the lower region in the @xmath50 invariant mass , where the final state interaction between the @xmath23 and nucleon might be strong .",
    "however , a much cleaner signal of the @xmath26 resonance excitation can be detected at excess energies larger than 100  mev , e.g. at 200  mev .",
