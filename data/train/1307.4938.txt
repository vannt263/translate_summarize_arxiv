    "cellular automata ( cas ) is a @xmath1-dimensional array with a finite automaton residing at each site .",
    "each automaton called cell takes the states of neighbouring cells as input and makes the transition of its state according to a set of transition rules .",
    "cas are also considered to be spatially and temporally discrete dynamical systems with large degrees of freedom .",
    "it was proved that elementary ca ( eca ) , namely one - dimensional and two - state , three - neighbor ca rule 110 is computationally universal  @xcite . the ability to perform any algorithms",
    "is called computational universality . in addition , the evolution of rule 110 starting from a random initial configuration exhibits @xmath0 noise  @xcite .",
    "another example of computationally universal ca is the game of life ( life )  @xcite .",
    "life is a two - dimensional and two - state , nine - neighbor outer totalistic ca .",
    "it is supposed that life is capable of supporting universal computation , while the evolution starting from a random initial configuration has @xmath0-type spectrum  @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that there is a relationship between computational universality and @xmath0 noise in cas .",
    "however the range of frequencies in the power spectra of eca rule 110 that fits in power law is not broad .",
    "this is caused by the periodic background that is a periodic pattern typically observed in the evolution of rule 110 .",
    "since the periodic background does not play an essential role for performing computation , we can guess that the essential feature of the evolution of rule 110 as a computing process is not lost by the removal of the periodic background and that @xmath0-type spectrum becomes clear by removing the periodic background .",
    "in this paper we study the influence of the removal the periodic background on the shape of power spectrum of several eca rules . in section 2",
    "we explain the method of spectral analysis of elementary cellular automata . in the following three sections we deals with eca rule 110 as well as rule 54 and rule 62 which exhibit power law in power spectrum . in the final section",
    "we discuss the relationship between computational universality and @xmath0 noise in cas .",
    "let @xmath2 be the value of site @xmath3 at time step @xmath4 in an elementary ca .",
    "the site value evolves by iteration of the mapping , @xmath5 here @xmath6 is an arbitrary function specifying the elementary ca rule .",
    "the elementary ca rule is determined by a binary sequence with length @xmath7 , @xmath8 therefore the total number of possible distinct elementary ca rules is @xmath9 and each rule is abbreviated by the decimal representation of the binary sequence as used in @xcite . out of",
    "the 256 elementary ca rules 88 of them remain independent ( appendix of @xcite ) .",
    "the discrete fourier transformation of a time series of states @xmath10 of site @xmath3 for @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 the power per site is defined as @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the total number of sites and the summation is taken in all sites .",
    "the period of the component at a frequency @xmath15 in a power spectrum is given by @xmath16 . throughout this paper",
    "we employ periodic boundary conditions where the sites are connected in a circle and each array is started from a random initial configuration where each site takes state 0 or state 1 randomly with independent equal probability .",
    "the spectral analysis on the evolution of 88 independent ecas starting from random initial configuration revealed that the power spectra of most of the rules is white noise or lorenzian type and that rule 54 , rule 62 and rule 110 has the power spectra of power law and especially rule 110 exhibits @xmath0 noise during the longest time steps  @xcite .",
    "we focus on the eca rules which have power spectrum of power law , namely rule 54 , rule 62 and rule 110 .",
    "the rule function of rule 110 is given by the following : @xmath17 the upper line represents the 8 possible states of neighborhood and the lower line specifies the state of the center cell at the next time step .",
    "figure [ fig : sptr110 ] ( left ) shows a typical example of the space - time pattern of rule 110 starting from a random initial configuration of 200 cells for 200 time steps . in space - time pattern ,",
    "configurations obtained at successive time steps in the evolution are shown on successive horizontal lines in which black squares represent sites with value 1 , white squares sites with value 0 .",
    "we can observe periodic background of small white triangles with period seven in the space - time pattern .",
    "figure [ fig : fspr110 ] ( left ) is the power spectrum of rule 110 calculated from the evolution starting from a random initial configuration of 4000 cells for 4096 time steps .",
    "there are peaks at @xmath18 ( period:7 ) and its harmonics in the spectrum .",
    "the exponent @xmath19 of power spectrum is estimated by the least - squares fitting of the power spectrum @xmath20 by @xmath21 .",
    "the residual sum of squares @xmath22 is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the number of data used for the calculation of @xmath22 and we set @xmath25 .",
    "the broken line in the power spectrum represents the least - squares fitting of the power spectrum @xmath20 in the range of @xmath26 with the exponent of power spectrum @xmath27 and the residual sum of squares @xmath28 .    the computational universality of rule 110 is proved by having rule 110 emulate cyclic tag system that is another computationally universal system .",
    "the stationary and propagating patterns and the interaction between those pattrens are elaborately utilized for implementing cyclic tag system in the evlution of rule 110 . on the other hand",
    ", the periodic background does not seem to play an essential role for performing computation .",
    "therefore we can guess that the essential feature of the evolution of rule 110 as a computing process is not lost by the removal of the periodic background from the space - time pattern and that the power spectrum calculated from the evolution obtained by removing the periodic background characterizes more vividly the behavior of rule 110 than the original power spectrum .",

    "these results imply that the removal of periodic background from the evolution of rule 110 brings about the effect that the power spectrum comes close to power law .",
    "it is a matter of course that the power spectrum depends on initial configuration .",
