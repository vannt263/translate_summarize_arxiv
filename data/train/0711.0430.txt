    "the ricci flow @xcite has been used by mathematicians to understand the topology of three manifolds .",
    "it appears likely that these mathematical developments will also be useful in physics in the study of geometric theories like general relativity .",
    "several papers @xcite have appeared dealing with physical applications of the ricci flow .",
    "the ricci flow ( rf ) is a ( degenerate ) parabolic differential equation , and is very similar to the heat equation . in a previous paper @xcite",
    "we explored an analogy between the ricci flow and thermodynamics .",
    "the analogy is based on the observation that the ricci flow ( like the heat equation ) loses memory of initial conditions , just as a physical system loses memory of its initial state as it approaches thermal equilibrium . as was noticed there , a slight modification of the ricci flow yields schwarzschild space as a fixed point . in this paper",
    "we look at the unmodified ricci flow to see how some physically interesting quantities evolve with the flow .",
    "energy and entropy are quantities of physical interest from the thermodynamic point of view . in general relativity",
    "these quantities take on a purely differential geometric meaning : the entropy is related to the area of black hole horizons and the energy to the adm mass at infinity .",
    "we investigate the the evolution of these quantities under the ricci flow and derive some inequalities relating them .",
    "the subject of entropy bounds @xcite has been of wide and sometimes controversial @xcite interest to physicists .",
    "it is believed that such bounds contain clues towards quantum gravity .",
    "entropy bounds motivate ideas like `` the holographic hypothesis '' .",
    "there is a geometric entropy bound proposed by penrose , which connects two geometrical quantities : the area of the outermost horizon and the adm mass . in the seventies , roger penrose@xcite , in an attempt to test the idea of cosmic censorship ( which is part of the `` establishment view '' of gravitational collapse ) , used physical arguments to deduce from cosmic censorship an inequality relating the adm mass of an initial data set for gr and the area of its outermost apparent horizon : @xmath4 .",
    "this inequality , which is saturated by the schwarzschild space , has a clear thermodynamic interpretation .",
    "it states that schwarzschild spacetime maximises geometric entropy for a given energy .",
    "maximising entropy for fixed energy is a property which characterises a thermal state in statistical mechanics .",
    "the thermal character of hawking radiation from a schwarzschild black hole is entirely consistent with this interpretation .",
    "inequality appears to capture something deep about general relativity , with a thermodynamic statement expressed in geometric terms . in this respect , it is similar to the the area theorem@xcite , which represents the second law of thermodynamics in geometric form .",
    "a counterexample to penrose s inequality would imply a flaw in the establishment view .",
    "no counterexample has so far been found .",
    "special cases of penrose s inequality have been proved@xcite using geometric flow techniques .",
    "jang and wald @xcite showed that if one assumes the existence of the inverse mean curvature ( imc ) flow , ( a particular diffeomorphism of a spatial slice ) , one could address penrose s inequality in the special case of time symmetric initial data .",
    "their work was based on the monotonicity of the hawking mass under the inverse mean curvature flow , which follows from earlier work by geroch@xcite .",
    "this suggests a proof of the penrose inequality @xcite .",
    "the only gap in this proof is the existence of the imc flow .",
    "this gap was filled by huisken and ilmanen @xcite who showed that the hawking mass remained monotonic under a discontinuous version of the imc flow .",
    "the motivation behind the present work is to explore whether the ricci flow could lead to a new proof of the time symmetric penrose inequality .",
    "the general penrose inequality is still an open conjecture and new lines of attack ( even in the time symmetric case ) are certainly of interest .",
    "is it possible that a smooth combination of the ricci flow plus diffeomorphisms exists so that the evolution of hawking mass is monotonic ?",
    "the hope underlying the use of the rf is that the discontinuities ( like those of the imc flow ) will be smoothed out by the rf term .",
    "there are known examples in fluid mechanics where discontinuities of inviscid flow are smoothed out by viscous effects . with this motivation of developing a ricci flow approach to the penrose inequality , we have made a beginning in this paper by studying the evolution of area and hawking mass under the ricci flow .    in section",
    "ii we give a brief review of the ricci flow .",
    "for a more complete and rigorous account the reader is referred to the mathematical literature@xcite .",
    "section iii lists the geometrical quantities of physical interest in this paper .",
    "section iv paves the way for the general treament by treating the special case of spherical symmetry .",
    "this special case is useful since one can explicitly work out geometrical quantities of interest and develop a physical feel for them .",
    "spherical symmetry is a good source of physical examples and counterexamples which guide the general study . in section",
    "v we give up spherical symmetry and treat the evolution of area of a closed surface under the ricci flow and derive an inequality relating the rate of change of area and the hawking mass .",
    "section vi treats the evolution of hawking mass under ricci flow and puts forward a conjectured maximum principle which governs the long time behaviour of the flow .",
    "section vii is a concluding discussion .",
    "our metric conventions are from ref.@xcite .",
    "let @xmath5 be an asymptotically flat , three dimensional riemannian manifold .",
    "( @xmath6 run over 1,2,3 .",
    "we restrict our discussion to three dimensional manifolds . )",
    "our interest is in asymptotically flat spaces since we are interested in the energy and entropy of black holes .",
    "the definitions of energy , entropy and black holes all need an asymptotic region . the total energy or adm mass of an initial data set is only well defined if an asymptotic structure ( either flat or ads ) is fixed .",
    "black holes are defined as regions of spacetime from which escape to infinity is impossible and thus refer to an asymptotic structure .",
    "we require that the metric tend to a _ fixed _",
    "flat metric @xmath7 at infinity @xmath8 .",
    "given an initial metric @xmath9 , the ricci flow evolves the metric according to its ricci tensor .",
    "the evolution parameter is @xmath10 and the family of metrics on @xmath11 , @xmath12 satisfies the ricci flow equation @xmath13 in the neighborhood of a point @xmath14 , we can introduce a riemann normal co - ordinate system and then the form of ( [ ricciflow ] ) becomes parabolic ( @xmath15 is the laplacian in local co - ordinates ) @xmath16 and looks like a heat equation for the metric coefficients .",
    "however , in a general co - ordinate system , the pde ( [ ricciflow ] ) is a _ degenerate _",
    "parabolic equation , because of its diffeomorphism invariance .",
    "more generally , we will be interested in the ricci flow modified by a diffeomorphism @xmath17 where @xmath18 is any vector field on @xmath19 which vanishes at infinity .",
    "calculationally , it is convenient to consider the two terms separately , defining a _ pure _ ricci flow ( [ ricciflow ] ) and a _ pure _ diffeo @xmath20 in the mathematical literature on ricci flows ( which deals with compact spaces ) the term @xmath21 is sometimes added to the rhs of ( [ ricciflow ] ) to define a `` normalised ricci flow '' .",
    "such a term is inadmissible in the present physical context as it would rescale the metric at infinity and violate our asymptotic requirement that the metric tends to a _ fixed _",
    "flat metric at infinity .    in the standard initial value formulation @xcite of general relativity ,",
    "the basic variables are the induced metric @xmath9 on a spatial slice @xmath19 in the space - time manifold @xmath22 , @xmath23 and the extrinsic curvature @xmath24 of @xmath19 .",
    "we also use the notation @xmath25 .",
    "these variables are subject to constraints : @xmath26 and @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the matter current and @xmath29 is the matter density .",
    "the matter is required to satisfy `` energy conditions '' , the dominant , weak or strong energy condition .",
    "a three dimensional manifold @xmath5 can be viewed as a time symmetric intitial data set for einstein s equations . by `` time symmetric '' we mean that the extrinsic curvature @xmath24 of @xmath19 has been set to zero , so that @xmath5 is totally geodesic .",
    "( this is similar to choosing initial data in classical mechanics so that all the momenta vanish .",
    "dropping n particles from rest is an example . ) with @xmath24 ( and the matter current @xmath30 ) set to zero , the diffeomorphism constraint ( [ constraint1 ] ) is automatically satisfied and the hamiltonian constraint reduces to @xmath31 .",
    "a physically important constraint on initial data for general relativity is that the data are subject to an energy condition .",
    "the dominant , weak and strong energy conditions all imply the local energy condition , which states that the local energy density is non - negative .",
    "this translates into the geometrical statement that the scalar curvature @xmath32 of @xmath9 be non - negative .",
    "the ricci flow has the appealing property that it preserves the non - negativity of scalar curvature@xcite .",
    "this follows from the `` maximum principle '' for the scalar curvature . under ricci flow([ricciplusdiffeo ] ) , the scalar curvature satisfies the non linear heat type equation @xmath33 which implies that @xmath34 is positive at a minimum of @xmath32 .",
    "eq.([ricciplusdiffeo ] ) provides us with a flow on the space of initial data to einstein s equations which remains within physically allowed ( non - negative scalar curvature ) data .",
    "let @xmath3 be a closed surface in @xmath19 , @xmath35 the pull back or induced metric on @xmath3 , @xmath36 the scalar curvature of @xmath37 and @xmath38 the trace of its extrinsic curvature",
    ". we will be interested in the evolution of some geometric properties of @xmath3 under the ricci flow .",
    "these are the area of @xmath3 , @xmath39 and the hawking mass of @xmath3 @xmath40 our interest in these quantities stems from their physical significance .",
    "the area of apparent horizons is related to the entropy of black holes and the hawking mass is related to the energy .",
    "the hawking mass of a surface @xmath3 can be physically interpreted as the mass contained within the surface @xmath3 . while there are some problems with this interpretation ( positivity is not always assured ) , the hawking mass is an useful notion@xcite of quasilocal mass .",
    "it vanishes in the limit that @xmath3 shrinks to a point and becomes the adm energy for a round sphere at infinity .",
    "in fact , the supremum of @xmath41 over @xmath3 is the adm mass as one can see from @xcite . unlike the adm energy ,",
    "which is only well - defined for asymptotic spheres , the hawking mass is defined for any closed surface @xmath3 . under the rf , a surface @xmath3 , which is initially asymptotic may shrink into the interior of @xmath19 .",
    "for this reason hawking mass is a more convenient object to study than the adm mass .    rather than the hawking mass",
    ", it is more convenient to deal with the related dimensionless quantity the `` compactness '' of @xmath3 @xmath42 which is a combination of the hawking mass and the area@xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath43 has been used to good effect by geroch , jang and wald @xcite in their approach to positive mass theorem and the penrose inequality .",
    "in fact their work forms the base for recent progress @xcite on the riemannian penrose inequality .",
    "we will see that @xmath43 tends to zero as @xmath3 tends to a round sphere of infinitesimal radius and also as @xmath3 tends to an asymptotic round sphere .",
    "the ricci flow is a tensor evolution equation and therefore commutes with diffeomorphisms .",
    "it follows that isometry groups are preserved under the ricci flow .",
    "one way to approach the ricci flow is to start with symmetric situations so that the complexity of the flow is reduced .",
    "if we impose so much symmetry that the spaces of interest are homogeneous , the rf becomes an ode rather than a pde .",
    "such situations have been studied@xcite . however , this assumption is too restrictive from our present physical motivation .",
    "we would like to deal with asymptotically flat ( or ads ) spaces since energy is defined with respect to an asymptotic structure .",
    "homogeneous spaces which are asymptotically flat would be everywhere flat and not very interesting .",
    "spherical symmetry has the advantage that there _ are _ non trivial asymptotically flat spaces .",
    "the ricci flow reduces to a pde with just two independent variables , the @xmath10 and @xmath44 co - ordinates .",
    "as we will see , spherically symmetric spaces will provide us with an analytical as well as numerical testing ground and pave the way for the general treatment .",
    "this special case is useful since one can develop a physical feel for the geometrical quantities of interest and easily produce physical examples and counterexamples as a guide to intuition .",
    "while setting up the spherically symmetric initial data set , we will work with two forms of the metric .",
    "each of these has its use and its limitation",
    ". we will refer to them as `` a - form '' and `` b - form '' . they correspond to different choices of co - ordinate gauge .",
    "* * the a - form : * in this form of the initial data set , the 3-metric is taken as @xmath45 with this form of the metric we calculate the ricci tensor and the scalar curvature : the nonzero components of the ricci tensors are ( a prime means differentiation with respect to @xmath44 ) @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 the scalar curvature is @xmath49 + the a - form is useful for the study of the evolution of hawking mass @xmath50 .",
    "however , this form of the metric is not useful if there is an apparent horizon because in that case @xmath51 blows up at the apparent horizon . to study the evolution of the area of the apparent horizon under rf we use the `` b - form '' of the metric discussed next . * * the b - form : * in this form of the initial data set , the 3-metric is taken as @xmath52 with this metric we again calculate the ricci tensor and the scalar curvature : the nonzero components of the ricci tensor are @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 the scalar curvature is @xmath56    _ a - form and hawking mass : _ let us start with the a - form ( [ aform ] ) of the metric and evaluate the hawking mass functional ( [ mass ] ) for @xmath3 chosen to be a sphere @xmath57 . for this spherical topology , the first term in ( [ compactness ] ) gives @xmath58 by the gauss - bonnet theorem and @xmath59 let @xmath60 be a unit normal to the surface @xmath3 .",

    "one can physically identify @xmath3 as the boundary of a black hole region .",
    "outermost horizons have the property that the surface has minimum area ( and not just stationary area ) .",

    "a similar conclusion has been reached by @xcite in a slightly different context : entanglement entropy of a two dimensional black hole is monotonically decreasing along the rf .",
    "if one uses the ricci flow to model the approach of a system to thermal equilibrium , one would expect that the entropy increases along the flow .",
    "however , we have seen that outermost horizons have spherical topology and their area",
