    "in recent years , the universal scaling in non - equilibrium states have attracted much attention .",
    "the phase - ordering process ( pop ) @xcite and the short - time critical dyanmics ( scd ) @xcite are two fruitful examples .    in the critical dynamics , the short - time phenomena are those which happen at the times just after a microscopic time - scale @xmath4 needed for a system to forget its microscopic details , and much smaller than the macroscopic time scale @xmath8 . since the pioneer work of h.k .",
    "janssen et al @xcite , universal short - time scaling has been found in a variety of different models ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) .",
    "it is believed that the singularity of the temporal correlation is essential to the short - time scaling .",
    "therefore the scaling can emerge in the short - time regime of the evolution eventhough all spatial correlations are still short - ranged .",
    "the dynamics to be considered here has no conservation law , which is sometimes called model a @xcite .",
    "all critical exponents as well as the critical point can be fixed in the short - time regime @xcite .",
    "this is important especially for monte carlo simulations because at the critical temperature a system needs infinite time to relax to equilibrium due to the critical slowing down .",
    "it is good to avoid doing measurements in equilibrium states .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to investigate the connection between the short - time regime and the long - time regime and the crossover of scaling patterns from one regime to another .",
    "the power law increase of order in the scd is valid only in the case of a small initial order - parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the general case of an arbitrary @xmath0 has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the initial state with non - zero @xmath0 is off - critical .",
    "a characteristic function must be introduced to describe the moving of @xmath0 in the scale transformation . with the characteristic function",
    ", the scaling law can be extended to a large @xmath0 and all @xmath9 .",
    "as far as we know , only the numerical evidence has been found for this characteristic function . in this paper , the soluble kinetic spherical model ( ksm )",
    "will provide a concrete example .    instead of a quench to the critical temperature @xmath10 in the scd ,",
    "the system in the pop is quenched to a temperature lower than the critical one . for a system quenched from a symmetric initial state , the final equilibrium is never achieved since the ergodicity is broken in the thermodynamics .",
    "instead , the length - scale of ordered regions grows with time as the different broken - symmetry phases compete to select the equilibrium state .",
    "this temporal singularity should also be the essence of the ordering scaling .",
    "it has been found both experimentally and theoretically @xcite that the pop at late times can be described by a single characteristic length - scale @xmath11 , reflecting the self - similarity of domain patterns at different times .",
    "if the initial state breaks the symmetry , as the case of @xmath12 to be discussed here , the equilibrium can be achieved .",
    "a natural question is how long the phase - ordering scaling will last .",
    "the non - zero @xmath0 generates a time - scale @xmath13 which characterizes the most interesting short - time regime where we will see new scaling patterns . since @xmath14 as @xmath15 ,",
    "the so - called short - time regime in fact can persist to a very long time .",
    "the scd and the pop are governed by two different fixed points , i.e. , @xmath10 and @xmath16 respectively , therefore they have different scaling laws .",
    "it will be interesting to see how the pop crosses over to the scd as @xmath1 grows from @xmath17 to @xmath10 . in the context of pop , besides @xmath13 there is another time - scale @xmath18 given by the non - zero temperature . in this paper",
    ", we will introduce a characteristic function to describe the temperature dependence of the process .",
    "since the critical exponents can not change smoothly , there must be a crossover region that separates the scd scaling domain from the scaling domain of pop .",
    "we will estimate the domain boundary through a self - consistency of the solution .    to obtain explicit analytical results ,",
    "we confine ourself to the soluble ksm with or without long - ranged interactions .",
    "the ksm is a generalization to the static spherical model @xcite , to which a model a dynamics is given by the langevin equation .",
    "the static spherical model has been proven to be equivalent to the large-@xmath19 limit @xmath19-vector model ( llnm ) in static properties @xcite .",
    "when the dynamics is included , they should be still equivalent in the thermodynamic limit since the fluctuation of @xmath20 in the llnm can be neglected .",
    "the llnm being a soluble kinetic model with a dimensionality higher than one has been extensively studied by many authors .",
    "the scd of the llnm with the short - ranged interaction and small @xmath0 is well - known @xcite . to the symmetric pop , i.e. , @xmath21 ,",
    "many results have been obtained for the model with either the short - ranged or the long - ranged interaction @xcite .",
    "we will use the language of ksm to present our new results originated from the non - symmetry initial state , i.e. , an arbitrary @xmath0 .",
    "the ksm has the domain - wall picture which is helpful for understanding the ordering process and the crossover from the pop to the scd .    in this paper",
    ", we will concentrate on the consequences of non - symmetric initial states .",
    "the time - dependent order parameter @xmath22 as well as the response propagator and correlation function are calculated .",
    "the dynamic behavior of the symmetric ksm with short - ranged interaction in the long - time regime was already studied in @xcite , where no trace of the initial condition is left . in the case of non - zero @xmath0",
    ", the order - parameter has non - equilibrium values in the short - time regime after the system is quenched from a very high temperature .",
    "it will show rich scaling patterns governed by the double time - scales @xmath13 and @xmath18 .",
    "it has been known that the critical exponents can be modified by the interaction range . how the characteristic critical exponent @xmath23 or @xmath24 depends on the interaction range has not been explicitly shown .",
    "but from the general consideration of that the longer interaction range and higher dimension are both in favor of the spacial correlation , the long interaction range will decrease the exponent @xmath24 .",
    "we will show that is just the case in the ksm .",
    "particularly we show that the interaction - range parameter @xmath25 and the dimensionality @xmath26 enter the time - dependent order - parameter @xmath22 always in the combination @xmath27 .",

    "the ordering scaling can smoothly cross over to the critical scaling and then to the high - temperature phase .",
    "but at the crossover temperatures , there is no simple scaling law .",
    "we find that the bulk time - dependent order has the special feature that it depends on @xmath26 and the interaction range - parameter @xmath25 only through their ratio .",
    "the longer ( shorter ) the interaction - range is , the higher ( lower ) the effective dimension .",
    "it is physically plausible because the correlation can be strengthened ( weakened ) by either increasing ( decreasing ) the interaction - range or dimension .",
    "the llnm should have the same properties as those we find in the ksm",
    ". therefore our results about the characteristic functions and the intermediate - time scaling in the pop can be used as the starting - point of finite-@xmath19 expansions .",
    "we have investigated the ksm in the non - classical regime @xmath93 . in the classical regime @xmath258 , the initial increase would be un - observable .",
    "when @xmath259 , the situation would be more complicated . at @xmath260 , there would be a logorithmic correction .",
    "we leave these for further investigation .",
    "our results can also be extended to a finite - size lattice @xcite .",
