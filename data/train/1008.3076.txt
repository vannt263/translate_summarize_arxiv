    "it is well - known @xcite , that the finite temperature perturbation expansion breaks down at the temperatures above the electroweak transition / crossover already for higgs masses above about @xmath8 gev .",

    "nambu monopoles are not described by means of a perturbation expansion around the trivial vacuum background .",
    "therefore , nonperturbative methods should be used in order to investigate their physics . however",
    ", their mass is estimated at the tev scale .",
    "that s why at zero temperature and at the energies much less than @xmath5 tev their effect on physical observables is negligible .",
    "however , when energy of the processes approaches @xmath5 tev we expect these objects influence the dynamics .",
    "recently the indications in favor of this point of view were indeed found @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider lattice realization of zero temperature electroweak theory ( without fermions ) .",
    "the phase diagram of the correspondent lattice model contains physical higgs phase , where scalar field is condensed and gauge bosons @xmath9 and @xmath10 acquire their masses .",
    "this physical phase is bounded by the phase transition surface . crossing this surface one leaves the higgs phase and enters the phase of the lattice theory , where the scalar field is not condensed .    in the lattice theory",
    "the ultraviolet cutoff is finite and is equal to the momentum @xmath11 ( see , for example , @xcite ) , where @xmath4 is the lattice spacing .",
    "the physical scale can be fixed , for example , using the value of the @xmath9-boson mass @xmath12 gev .",
    "therefore the lattice spacing is evaluated to be @xmath13^{-1 } m_z$ ] , where @xmath14 is the @xmath9 boson mass in lattice units . within the physical phase of the theory",
    "the lines of constant physics ( lcp ) are defined that correspond to constant renormalized physical couplings ( the fine structure constant @xmath15 , the weinberg angle @xmath16 , and higgs mass to z - boson mass ratio @xmath17 ) .",
    "the points on lcp are parametrized by the lattice spacing .",
    "our observation is that the lcp corresponding to realistic values of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath18 crosses the transition between the two `` phases '' at a certain value @xmath19 and for @xmath20 the scalar field is not condensed .",
    "we denote the corresponding value of the cutoff @xmath21 .",
    "our estimate for the considered values of the higgs mass @xmath22 gev is @xmath23 tev ( for the considered lattice sizes ) .",
    "we do not observe the dependence of @xmath24 on the lattice size .",
    "that s why the value @xmath24 might appear as the maximal possible value of the cutoff allowed in the conventional electroweak theory .",
    "it is important to compare this result with the limitations on the ultraviolet cutoff , that come from the perturbation theory . from the point of view of perturbation",
    "theory the energy scale @xmath5 tev appears in the hierarchy problem @xcite .",
    "namely , the mass parameter @xmath25 for the scalar field receives a quadratically divergent contribution in one loop .",
    "therefore , the initial mass parameter ( @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the vacuum average of the scalar field ) should be set to infinity in such a way that the renormalized mass @xmath28 remains negative and finite .",
    "this is the content of the so - called fine tuning .",
    "it is commonly believed that this fine tuning is not natural @xcite and , therefore , one should set up the finite ultraviolet cutoff @xmath6 . from the requirement",
    "that the one - loop contribution to @xmath25 is less than @xmath29 one derives that @xmath30 tev .",
    "however , strictly speaking , the possibility that the mentioned fine tuning takes place is not excluded .    in the perturbation theory",
    "there is also more solid limitation on the ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "it appears as a consequence of the triviality problem , which is related to landau pole in scalar field self coupling @xmath31 and in the fine structure constant @xmath15 .",
    "the landau pole in fine structure constant is related to the fermion loops and , therefore , has no direct connection with our lattice result ( we neglect dynamical fermions in our consideration ) . due to the landau pole",
    "the renormalized @xmath31 is zero , and the only way to keep it equal to its measured value is to impose the limitation on the cutoff .",
    "that s why the electroweak theory is usually thought of as a finite cutoff theory . for small higgs masses ( less than about @xmath32 gev )",
    "the correspondent energy scale @xmath33 calculated within the perturbation theory is much larger , than @xmath5 tev .",
    "in particular , for @xmath34 gev we have @xmath35 tev .",
    "it is worth mentioning that for @xmath36 the perturbation expansion in @xmath31 can not be used . in this case",
    "higgs mass approaches its absolute upper bound gauge - higgs model this upper bound can not exceed @xmath37 .",
    "] , and both triviality and hierarchy scales approach each other .    from the previous research we know that the phase diagram in the @xmath38 - @xmath39 plane of the lattice @xmath40 gauge - higgs for any fixed @xmath31 resembles the phase diagram for the lattice weinberg - salam model .",
    "the only difference is that in the @xmath40 gauge - higgs model the confinement - deconfinement phase transition corresponding to the @xmath41 constituents of the model is absent .",
    "the direct measurement of the renormalized coupling @xmath42 shows @xcite that the line of constant renormalized coupling constant ( with the value close to the experimental one ) intersects the phase transition line . also we know from the direct measurements of @xmath43 in the @xmath40 gauge - higgs model that the ultraviolet cutoff is increased when one is moving along this line from the physical higgs phase to the symmetric phase .    on the tree level the gauge boson mass in lattice units vanishes on the transition surface at small enough @xmath31",
    "this means that the tree level estimate predicts the appearance of an infinite ultraviolet cutoff at the transition point for small @xmath31 . at infinite @xmath31",
    "the tree level estimate gives nonzero values of lattice masses at the transition point .",
    "our numerical investigation of @xmath44 model ( at @xmath45 ) and previous calculations in the @xmath40 gauge higgs model ( both at finite @xmath31 and at @xmath46 ) showed that for the considered lattice sizes renormalized masses do not vanish and the transition is either of the first order or a crossover .",
    "( actually , the situation , when the cutoff tends to infinity at the position of the transition point means that there is a second order phase transition . )",
    "the dependence on the lattice sizes for the @xmath40 gauge higgs model was investigated , for example , in @xcite .",
    "namely , for @xmath47 , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 , the correlation lengths were evaluated at the transition points . for different lattice sizes ( from @xmath50 to @xmath51 ) no change in correlation length",
    "was observed @xcite .    in table 1 of @xcite the data on the ultraviolet cutoff achieved in selected lattice studies of the @xmath40 gauge higgs model are presented . everywhere",
    "@xmath38 is around @xmath52 and the renormalized fine structure constant is around @xmath53 .",
    "this table shows that the maximal value of the cutoff @xmath11 ever achieved in these studies is around @xmath7 tev .",
    "thus the predictions on the value of @xmath24 given by our lattice study and on the value @xmath33 given by the perturbation theory contradict with each other . a possible explanation of this contradiction we suggested in @xcite .",
    "namely , it was demonstrated that in the vicinity of the transition there exists the fluctuational region . within this region",
    "the application of the perturbation theory is limited .",
    "this situation is similar to that of some phenomenological models that describe condensed matter systems , where there exists the vicinity of the finite temperature phase transition that is also called fluctuational region . in this region",
    "the fluctuations of the order parameter become strong .",
    "the contribution of these fluctuations to certain physical observables becomes larger than the tree level estimate .",
    "thus the perturbation theory in these models fails down within the fluctuational region .",
    "we find that there exists the vicinity of the phase transition between the higgs phase and the symmetric phase in the weinberg - salam model , where the fluctuations of the scalar field become strong and the perturbation expansion around trivial vacuum can not be applied . according to the numerical results the continuum theory is to be approached within the vicinity of the phase transition , i.e. the cutoff is increased along the line of constant physics when one approaches the point of the transition .",
    "that s why the conventional prediction on the value of the cutoff admitted in the standard model based on the perturbation theory may be incorrect .    in the present paper",
    "we proceed the investigation @xcite of the model at the value of the scalar self coupling @xmath54 ( corresponds to the higgs boson mass around @xmath55 gev in the vicinity of the phase transition ) , bare weinberg angle @xmath56 , and bare fine structure constant around @xmath57 .",
    "the results presented now correspond to essentially larger lattices than that of used in @xcite .",
    "namely , in @xcite main results correspond to lattices @xmath58 ; some results were checked on the lattice @xmath59 ; two points were checked on the lattice @xmath60 .",
    "now our main results are obtained on the lattice @xmath60 while the results at the transition point were checked on the lattice @xmath61 .",
    "in addition we investigate the model at the value of the scalar self coupling @xmath62 , bare weinberg angle @xmath56 , and bare fine structure constant around @xmath63 .",
    "these values of couplings correspond to the higgs boson mass around @xmath64 gev in the vicinity of the phase transition .",

    "we also present results for @xmath65 , @xmath56 , @xmath63 .",
    "these values of couplings correspond to the higgs boson mass around @xmath66 gev .",
    "the results are obtained using lattices @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that far from the transition point the renormalized fine structure constant slowly approaches the tree level estimate .",
    "contrary to the maximal value of the cutoff the renormalized fine structure constant depends on the lattice size . and",
    "for the larger lattice the value of @xmath67 is closer to the tree level estimate than for the smaller one .",
    "for example , for @xmath68 ( far from the transition point ) on the lattice @xmath58 the value of @xmath67 is around @xmath69 while on the lattice @xmath59 it is around @xmath70 . within the fluctuational region",
    "the deviation from tree level estimate becomes essentially strong .",
    "for example , for @xmath71 ( near the transition point ) the renormalized value of @xmath67 calculated on the lattice @xmath58 is around @xmath72 while on the lattice @xmath61 its value is around @xmath73 .",
    "as it is seen from our numerical results and as it will be explained in the conclusions we guess the mentioned finite volume effects present in the value of renormalized @xmath15 do not affect the main observables we considered like the value of @xmath24 and the nambu monopole density .",
    "we calculate the constraint effective potential @xmath74 for the higgs field @xmath75 . in the physical higgs phase",
    "this potential has a minimum at a certain nonzero value @xmath76 of @xmath77 .",
    "this shows that the spontaneous breakdown of the electroweak symmetry takes place as it should .",
    "however , there exists the vicinity of the phase transition , where the fluctuations of the higgs field are of the order of @xmath76 while the hight of the `` potential barrier '' quantum mechanics with the similar potential there are two separated minima with the potential barrier between them . nevertheless we feel it appropriate to use the chosen terminology as the value of the `` potential barrier hight '' measures the difference between the potentials with and without spontaneous symmetry breaking . ]",
    "@xmath78 is of the order of @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the fluctuation of @xmath77 .",
    "we expect that in this region the perturbation expansion around trivial vacuum @xmath81 can not be applied .",
    "this region of the phase diagram is called the fluctuational region ( fr ) .",
    "the nature of the fluctuational region is illustrated by the behavior of quantum nambu monopoles @xcite .",
    "we show that their lattice density increases when the phase transition point is approached . within the fr these objects are so dense that it is not possible at all to speak of them as of single monopoles . moving along the line of constant physics",
    "we reach the point on the phase diagram where the monopole worldlines begin to percolate .",
    "this point was found to coincide roughly with the position of the transition between the physical higgs phase and the unphysical symmetric phase of the lattice model .",
    "this transition is a crossover and the ultraviolet cutoff achieves its maximal value around @xmath7 tev at the transition point . ]",

    "such complicated configurations obviously have nothing to do with the conventional vacuum used in the continuum perturbation theory .",

    "at finite @xmath31 the line of constant renormalized @xmath15 is not a line of constant physics , because the mass of the higgs boson depends on the position on this line .",
    "thus , in order to investigate the line of constant physics one should vary @xmath31 together with @xmath39 to keep the ratio of lattice masses @xmath119 constant .    in order to obtain the tree level estimates let us rewrite the lattice action in an appropriate way .",

    "actually , electromagnetic interactions can be taken into account perturbatively , with the renormalized @xmath380 as the parameter of the perturbation expansion .",
    "this was the reason why in the previous numerical studies of @xmath40 gauge - higgs model the @xmath41 constituent of weinberg - salam model was completely disregarded @xcite . to summarize , we suppose that in spite of the presence of finite volume effects in fine structure constant and @xmath10 boson mass , the calculated values of @xmath14 , @xmath6 , @xmath379 , @xmath80 etc can be considered as free of these effects is not suppressed by any small factor .",
    "we indeed observe that in the fr , where nonperturbative effects are large the renormalized @xmath15 differs from its bare value by about @xmath381 while far from the fr the difference is within @xmath378 ( for the lattice size @xmath382 ) . ]",
    "( up to the perturbations suppressed by the factor @xmath383 ) .    basing on our data it is natural to suppose that lattice gauge boson mass may vanish at @xmath339 although we do not observe the correspondent pattern in details because of the strong fluctuations of correlator ( [ corz ] ) near @xmath208 .",
    "if so , there exist @xmath118 pseudocritical points : @xmath208 , where lattice value of @xmath14 vanishes ( at this point the cutoff calculated as @xmath384 tends to infinity ) , @xmath202 , where scalar field condensate disappears , and @xmath207 that denotes the boundary of the fluctuational region ( at @xmath385 the average distance between nambu monopoles becomes of the order of their size ) .",
    "this situation is typical for the crossovers : different quantities change their behavior at different points on the phase diagram .",
    "there still exists the possibility that the point @xmath208 corresponds to the second order phase transition ( this may happen if , in addition , the scalar particle mass vanishes at @xmath208 ) .",
    "however , the absence of a peak in the scalar field fluctuation and in susceptibility ( [ chih ] ) at this point indicates that this is a crossover . actually , this possibility is to be checked carefully but this is to be a subject of another work .",
    "there is an important question : what is the relation between the conventional electroweak physics and the regions @xmath331 and @xmath386 .",
    "our expectation is that both these regions have nothing to do with real continuum physics .",
    "for the first region this is more or less obvious : there the scalar field is not condensed that contradicts with the usual spontaneous breakdown pattern .",
    "as for the second region , the situation is not so obvious . however , there the nonperturbative effects are strong and the nambu monopoles dominate vacuum that seems to us unphysical . with all mentioned above",
    "we come to the conclusion that our data indicate the appearance of the maximal value of the cutoff in electroweak theory that can not exceed the value of the order of @xmath5 tev .",
    "this prediction is made basing on the numerical investigation of the lattice model on the finite lattices . however , as it was mentioned above , our main results do not depend on the lattice size .",
    "this work was partly supported by rfbr grants 09 - 02 - 00338 , 08 - 02 - 00661 , by grant for leading scientific schools 679.2008.2 .",
