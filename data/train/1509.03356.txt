    "continuous - phase modulation ( cpms ) signals @xcite are very interesting modulation formats which combine a constant signal envelope and excellent spectral efficiency properties @xcite . in particular",
    ", the constant envelope makes these modulations insensitive to nonlinear distortions and thus very attractive for an employment in satellite communications and in low - cost and low - power consumption transmitter standards .",
    "an analog implementation of the cpm modulator allows to further reduce the transmitter cost , at the expense of possible variations of the cpm waveform parameters around their nominal values .",
    "in particular , the modulation index will vary since it depends on the not well calibrated gain of the employed voltage - controlled oscillator ( vco ) . as an example , in bluetooth operating in basic rate ( br ) and low energy ( le ) modes , the modulation index is specified to be in the intervals @xmath0 $ ] and @xmath1 $ ] , respectively  @xcite . the interval of the modulation index for the ultra low energy ( ule ) mode of the digital enhanced cordless telecommunication ( dect ) standard is @xmath2 $ ] @xcite . in the automatic identification system ( ais ) , the modulation index is nominally equal to @xmath3 but due to the imperfections of the ais equipments , a variation of @xmath4 is typically admitted  @xcite .    on the other hand , the optimal maximum a - posteriori ( map ) sequence or symbol detectors for cpms described in the literature , and implemented through the viterbi or the bcjr algorithm , respectively , require a perfect knowledge of the modulation index at the receiver . when a modulation index mismatch is present , a significant performance degradation is observed .",
    "one possible solution can be the adoption of a noncoherent detector ( e.g. , see  @xcite and references therein ) , due to its robustness to the phase uncertainty induced by the imperfect knowledge of the modulation index . as an example , in  @xcite noncoherent detection of continuous - phase frequency shift keying ( cpfsk ) signals is carried over a sliding window and decision is made only on the middle bit of this window .",
    "this allows to limit the accumulated phase error due to the modulation index error .",
    "another alternative can be represented by the adoption at the receiver of an algorithm for the estimation of the modulation index  @xcite coupled with the low - complexity algorithms described in  @xcite or in  @xcite which properly compensate the estimated error on the modulation index by using a per - survivor processing .",
    "more recently , the very general problem of soft - input soft - output ( siso ) detection of a binary cpm signal with an unknown modulation index transmitted over a channel with phase noise has been considered in  @xcite .",
    "all these schemes , however , operate at the receiver side and no attempt to increase the intrinsic robustness of the generated signal is made .",
    "this problem is addressed here .",
    "in other words , we will define new binary formats for which the performance degradation is very limited even when there is a significant modulation index mismatch between the transmitter and the receiver .",
    "these new schemes are based on the concatenation of a precoder with binary input and ternary output , and a ternary cpm scheme .",
    "the aim of the precoder is to constrain the evolution of the cpm phase state .",
    "two precoders will be described and investigated in this paper .",
    "we will show the properties of the power spectral density of these schemes and also study the uncoded performance and the spectral efficiency , which provides a benchmark on the coded performance , as discussed later .",
    "suboptimal detection will be also considered .",
    "these schemes preserve the recursive nature of cpm formats which makes them very attractive when serially concatenated , through a pseudo - random interleaver , with an outer channel encoder .",
    "in fact , it is well known that , when the inner modulator / encoder is recursive , an interleaver gain is observed  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ se : signals ] we will review binary and ternary cpm signals and their laurent decomposition .",
    "the proposed schemes and the corresponding detectors are described in section  [ se : schemes ] .",
    "section  [ sec : spectrum ] sheds some light on the power spectral density of these schemes and describes how the spectral efficiency is defined and computed . the performance analysis in case of uncoded transmission is investigated in section  [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "simulation results are reported in section  [ sec : sim_res ] , whereas conclusions are drawn in section  [ se : concl ] .",
    "in this section , we will briefly review binary and ternary cpms and their laurent decompositions  @xcite since they have relevance for the schemes proposed in this paper .",
    "the complex envelope of a cpm signal can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the energy per information symbol , @xmath7 the symbol interval , @xmath8 the modulation index , the function @xmath9 is the _ phase response _ , and its derivative is the _ frequency pulse _ , assumed of duration @xmath10 and integral 1/2 .",
    "the information symbols @xmath11 , assumed independent , belong to the alphabet @xmath12 in the case of binary cpms and to the alphabet @xmath13 in the case of ternary cpms .",
    "the modulation index is usually written as  @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are relatively prime integers ) . in this case , it can be shown  @xcite that the cpm signal in the generic time interval  @xmath17 $ ] is completely defined by the symbol  @xmath18 , the _ correlative state _ @xmath19 and the _ phase state _",
    "@xmath20 , which takes on @xmath16 values and can be recursively defined as @xmath21_{2\\pi}\\;,\\label{e : phase_state}\\ ] ] where @xmath22_{2\\pi}$ ] denotes the `` modulo @xmath23 '' operator .",
    "based on laurent representation , the complex envelope of a binary or a ternary cpm signal may be exactly expressed as  @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 represents the number of linearly - modulated components in the representation .",
    "it results to be @xmath26  @xcite or @xmath27  @xcite for binary or ternary cpms , respectively .",
    "the expressions of pulses @xmath28 as a function of @xmath9 and @xmath8 and those of symbols @xmath29 as a function of the information symbol sequence @xmath30 and @xmath8 may be found in @xcite . by truncating the summation in ( [ e : laurent ] ) considering only the first terms , we obtain an approximation of @xmath31 .    in the binary case ,",
    "most of the signal power is concentrated in the first component , i.e. , that associated with pulse @xmath32 , which is called _ principal component _  @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", the principal component may be used in ( [ e : laurent ] ) to attain a very good trade - off between approximation quality and number of signal components  @xcite . in this case , it holds @xmath33 symbols @xmath34 take on @xmath16 values  @xcite and it can be easily observed from ( [ e : phase_state ] ) and ( [ eq : alpha ] ) that @xmath35 .    in the ternary case ,",
    "most of the signal power is concentrated in two principal components , corresponding to pulses @xmath36 and @xmath37 . in this case , the corresponding symbols can be expressed as @xmath38\\alpha_{0,n-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 and @xmath40 belong to the alphabet @xmath41 and are such that @xmath42  @xcite . in this ternary case , it is again @xmath35 .    in low cost transmitters ,",
    "the value of the modulation index is often different from its nominal value which is instead assumed at the receiver . in the following",
    ", we will express the modulation index at the transmitter as @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the nominal value known at the receiver and @xmath45 accounts for the mismatch between transmitter and receiver and is assumed unknown .",
    "this mismatch has a catastrophic effect on the performance . as observed in  @xcite",
    ", the pulses of the principal components weakly depend on the value of the modulation index and thus on @xmath45 . on the contrary , the effect of @xmath45 is cumulative in the phase state ( [ e : phase_state ] ) and thus in @xmath46 .",
    "this observation motivates the schemes proposed in the next section .",
    "we consider transmission over an additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel .",
    "the complex envelope of the received signal thus reads @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a complex - valued white gaussian noise process with independent components , each with two - sided power spectral density @xmath49 . in the following",
    ", we will denote by @xmath50 a suitable vector of sufficient statistics extracted from the continuous - time received signal @xmath51 .",
    "our aim is to improve the robustness of classical binary cpm schemes to a modulation index mismatch .",
    "a classical binary cpm modulator can be represented as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : schemes](a ) .",
    "information bits @xmath52 , belonging to the alphabet @xmath53 are first mapped into symbols @xmath30 belonging to the alphabet @xmath12 , and then go at the input of a binary cpm modulator .",
    "the schemes proposed in this paper are instead based on the serial concatenation of an outer precoder , which receives at its input bits @xmath52 belonging to the alphabet @xmath53 and provides at its output ternary symbols @xmath30 belonging to the alphabet @xmath13 , and an inner ternary cpm .",
    "this concatenation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schemes](b ) .",
    "it is reminiscent of uncoded shaped - offset quadrature phase - shift keying ( soqpsk )  @xcite although the precoder is designed there for different purposes , i.e. , to allow a simple ( albeit suboptimal ) symbol - by - symbol detection architecture and the ternary cpm scheme is generic here .",
    "we design the precoder to avoid the cumulative effect of @xmath45 on the phase state , still keeping its recursive definition .",
    "this latter property is important to have an interleaver gain when the proposed schemes are concatenated with an outer encoder through an interleaver .    in order to explain the main ideas behind the proposed schemes ,",
    "let us consider the first proposed precoder .",
    "it is simply the classical alternate mark inversion ( ami ) precoder where bit @xmath54 is encoded as @xmath55 , whereas @xmath56 is encoded alternately as @xmath57 or @xmath58 . by denoting @xmath59 and assuming that the initial phase state is @xmath60",
    ", the arrival of a bit @xmath54 will leave the phase state in the previous value , i.e. , @xmath61 .",
    "on the contrary , the arrival of a bit @xmath56 will produce a change of phase state according to the following rule : @xmath62    we thus have the alternation of the phase states @xmath63 and @xmath64 according to the state diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : amiprecoder ] . in this state diagram , the values of @xmath65 are also shown .",
    "thus , there is no accumulation effect and a possible error on @xmath8 has a very limited impact on the performance , as shown in section  [ sec : sim_res ] .        as we will see in section  [ sec : spectrum ] , unless @xmath66 , the power spectral density of the signal resulting from the previous scheme has impulses at harmonics of the signaling rate @xmath67 .",
    "they are present when @xmath68 ( and this explains that when @xmath66 , i.e. , @xmath69 , these impulses are not present ) .",
    "these impulses can be used to help timing and frequency synchronization . in case",
    "they are considered as undesirable , another precoder can be used .",
    "this precoder must be defined such that all phase states @xmath70 occur with the same probability . in this way",
    ", it will be @xmath71 since equally spaced discrete values on the unit circles are taken by the phase state .",
    "one possible solution is the adoption of a precoder based on this simple rule : bit @xmath54 is again encoded as @xmath55 , and thus leaves the cpm signal into the same state , whereas bit @xmath56 is encoded as @xmath57 or @xmath58 .",
    "this time , however , the encoder provides at its output a block of @xmath16 symbols @xmath57 followed by a block of @xmath16 symbols @xmath58 , one after the other . without loss of generality , let us assume that the initial phase state of the modulator is @xmath60 .",
    "the state of the overall scheme is not only related to the actual cpm phase state @xmath72 but also to the sign of the block of symbols we are transmitting . starting from the phase state @xmath60 , the first @xmath16 input bits 1 will drive the phase state to the state @xmath73 passing through the states @xmath74 .",
    "then , the successive block of @xmath16 input bits 1 will take back the phase state to the initial value .",
    "thus , these phase states are taken with the same probability and @xmath71 .",
    "the state diagram of the overall scheme is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : second_precoder ] , where states @xmath75 and @xmath76 , which are the same phase state , have been split because conceptually different ( the beginning and the ending state of a symbols block @xmath57 ) .",
    "as far as detection is concerned , we could implement the optimal receivers through a bank of suitable matched filters followed by a viterbi  @xcite or a bcjr  @xcite algorithm with a proper number of states .",
    "however , a low - complexity suboptimal receiver with practically optimal performance can be implemented through a bank of two filters matched to pulses @xmath36 and @xmath37 , followed by a viterbi or a bcjr algorithm with branch metrics  @xcite , they can employ fixed front end filters . ]",
    "@xmath77\\nonumber \\\\ = & \\,\\re\\big\\{e^{-\\jmath \\phi_{n-1}}\\big[x_{0,n}e^{-\\jmath\\pi h a_n}\\nonumber\\\\ & + x_{1,n}\\big(\\frac{e^{-\\jmath\\pi h \\gamma_{0,n}}+e^{-\\jmath\\pi h \\gamma_{1,n}}}{2}\\big)\\big ] \\big\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath78 and @xmath79 being the outputs at time @xmath80 of the two matched filters , having impulse response @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively , @xmath65 is a function of @xmath72 and @xmath83 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : amiprecoder ] or in fig .",
    "[ fig : second_precoder ] , and , as previously stated , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are such that @xmath42 .",
    "these algorithms thus work on a trellis with only 2 states , independently of the value of @xmath8 , in the case of the ami precoder , whereas in the case of the second proposed encoder the number of states is @xmath84 .    from a complexity point of view of a suboptimal detector ,",
    "let us compare a classical binary cpm with the proposed precoders for a same modulation index and frequency pulse . for classical binary cpms a single matched filter",
    "is required whereas in the case of the proposed schemes , two matched filters of the same length are employed . the front end complexity is thus doubled .",
    "let us now consider the computational complexity in each trellis section .",
    "for the proposed precoders , the computation of a single branch metric requires to compute two terms @xmath85 instead of a single term @xmath86 .",
    "so the complexity for each trellis branch is doubled .",
    "regarding the number of branches in a single trellis section , which directly influences the receiver complexity and is given by the number of trellis states times the number of branches at the output of each state ( 2 in any case ) , this will be @xmath87 in the case of a classical cpm , @xmath88 for the ami precoder , and @xmath89 for the second precoder . as a consequence",
    ", we can conclude that in the case of the ami precoder the computational complexity in each trellis section is @xmath90 times that for a classical cpm , whereas for the second proposed precoder it is 4 times that for a classical cpm .",
    "we can now explain why the proposed schemes are more robust in the case of modulation index mismatch , as an example with reference to the second precoder .",
    "since the phase state starts from a certain value , evolves as a consequence of the arrival of @xmath16 input bits equal to one , and then comes back to that original value , the phase errors due to a modulation index mismatch do not accumulate and will be undone after @xmath84 input bits equal to one .",
    "we can also expect the ami precoder to be more robust than the second proposed precoder since the range of phase values , and thus the possible phase errors , is much more limited .",
    "in order to gain a deeper understanding of the effect of these precoders on the overall signal , we now consider the power spectral density ( psd ) of the transmitted signal in our proposed schemes . instead of considering the exact psd , we will consider the psd of the signal resulting from the approximation of the transmitted signal with its two principal components .",
    ", this representation with only two components turns out to be exact , i.e. , in ( [ e : laurent ] ) only two components are present in this case . ]",
    "hence , we approximate the transmitted signal as @xmath91 whose psd can be expressed as @xmath92 where @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 are the fourier transforms of the autocorrelations and crosscorrelations @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 , respectively , whereas @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the fourier transforms of pulses @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "the first two terms in ( [ e : psd ] ) represent the psd of the two components whereas the remaining one takes into consideration the correlation between the two components .",
    "it is straightforward to prove that , for the precoder in fig .",
    "[ fig : amiprecoder ] it is @xmath101 @xmath102 and @xmath103    as mentioned in the previous section , this psd presents some impulses , generated by the fact that , unless @xmath8 is such that @xmath104 , it is , according to the autocorrelation function properties  @xcite , @xmath105 however , it is sufficient to adopt a precoder such that in fig .",
    "[ fig : second_precoder ] that makes @xmath106 to avoid the presence of such impulses . in fact , for ternary cpms , by considering all symbols @xmath29 ( not only those corresponding to principal components ) it can be easily shown that they can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath107 for a suitable @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is a suitable ( nonlinear ) function .",
    "since @xmath110 is independent of future symbols @xmath111 , @xmath106 is a sufficient condition for having @xmath112 .",
    "thus we have @xmath113 and no impulses will be present in the resulting psd .",
    "the computation of the psd when the precoder in fig .",
    "[ fig : second_precoder ] is used is much more involved and is not reported here .",
    "the precoder has effect not only on the psd but also on the performance of the overall resulting scheme . in order to gain a deeper understanding of the schemes resulting from the proposed concatenations",
    ", we also evaluated their spectral efficiency ( se ) . the spectral efficiency @xmath114 is defined as @xmath115\\label{eq : se}\\ ] ] where @xmath116 is the information rate , i.e. , the amount of information transmitted per channel use , and @xmath117 is the bandwidth occupied by the transmitted signal .",
    "this normalization is required to capture the different bandwidth occupancy of different modulation formats . in other words , by considering the spectral efficiency , i.e. , the amount of information transmitted per unity of time and per unity of bandwidth , we are also considering the effect of the precoding on the bandwidth occupancy . our aim is to understand if the proposed binary schemes have a se comparable with that of the classical binary schemes for a same frequency pulse and modulation index , and thus a similar performance has to be expected when the proposed signals are employed in coded systems .",
    "cpm bandwidth is theoretically infinite because the psd of a cpm signal has rigorously an infinite support .",
    "hence , we consider the traditional definition of bandwidth based on the power concentration , that is the bandwidth that contains a given fraction of the overall power . being this fraction a parameter",
    ", we choose to use the @xmath118 of the overall power .",
    "this definition is consistent with systems where a limitation on the out - of - band power exists . to compute this bandwidth , we need the cpm power spectral density , which can not be evaluated analytically in closed form but only numerically . ) .",
    "instead , we adopted the technique described in  @xcite for the computation of the psd . ]",
    "an alternative bandwidth definition could be adopted . in particular",
    ", we could refer to the definitions employed in  @xcite .",
    "this would change our considerations only from a quantitative point of view .    to compute the information rate @xmath116 in  ( [ eq : se ] )",
    ", we can use the simulation - based technique described in @xcite , which only requires the existence of an optimal map symbol detector for the considered system . the simulation - based method described in @xcite",
    "allows to evaluate the achievable information rate as @xmath119\\label{eq : air}\\ ] ] where the probability density functions @xmath120 and @xmath121 can be evaluated recursively through the forward recursion of the optimal map symbol detection algorithm , thus in the absence of modulation index mismatch .",
    "this receiver can assure communication with arbitrarily small non - zero error probability when the transmission rate at the cpm modulator input does not exceed @xmath122 bits per channel use , provided that a suitable channel code is adopted .",
    "we consider the performance of the proposed signals when transmitted over the awgn channel .",
    "we will consider the asymptotic performance for high values of @xmath123 , @xmath124 being the mean energy per information bit .",
    "no channel coding is assumed to be used , thus @xmath125 , let us denote by @xmath126 the sequence representing the difference between the transmitted sequence @xmath127 and the erroneous one @xmath128 . without loss of generality , we will assume that any considered error event starts at time @xmath129 .",
    "we will also denote the normalized squared euclidean distance  @xcite @xmath130    the probability of bit error for the optimal map sequence detector ( implemented through the viterbi algorithm ) is well approximated by  @xcite @xmath131 where @xmath132 @xmath133 is the number of bit errors ( i.e. , on the sequence @xmath52 ) caused by the error event @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 is the span of symbol times where @xmath134 is different from zero and @xmath137 is the gaussian q function . if there are more sequences @xmath138 corresponding to @xmath139 , the bit error probability will have more terms of the form of the right hand side of ( [ eq : prob_error ] ) , each one corresponding to a different sequence @xmath138 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath140 is often called _ multiplicity _ of the error event with minimum distance  @xcite .",
    "now , it only remains to identify the error events corresponding to @xmath139 .",
    "this can be done by working on the phase tree , as described in  @xcite .",
    "we considered different modulation formats and computed the corresponding parameters @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , and @xmath139 , for both the classical binary schemes and the proposed ones .",

    "the results are reported in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "it can be observed that the proposed schemes do not modify the minimum distance and , at most , they modify the multiplicity of the error event by a factor 2 , although we do not have a formal proof that this always holds . in particular",
