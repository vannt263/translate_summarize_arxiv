    "let @xmath0 be a finite - dimensional simple lie algebra over @xmath3 and @xmath4 its universal enveloping algebra . choose a basis @xmath5 , of @xmath0 , and let @xmath6 the dual basis with respect to a non - degenerate invariant bilinear form on @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath7 be a collection of distinct complex numbers .",
    "the _ gaudin hamiltonians _ are the following elements of the algebra @xmath8 : @xmath9 where for @xmath10 we denote by @xmath11 the element of @xmath8 which is the tensor product of @xmath12 in the @xmath13th factor and @xmath14 in all other factors .",
    "one checks easily that these elements commute with each other and are invariant with respect to the diagonal action of @xmath0 on @xmath8 .    for any collection @xmath15 of @xmath0-modules ,",
    "the gaudin hamiltonians give rise to commuting linear operators on @xmath16 .",
    "we are interested in the diagonalization of these operators .",
    "more specifically , we will consider the following two cases : when all of the @xmath17 s are verma modules and when they are finite - dimensional irreducible modules .",
    "it is natural to ask : are there any other elements in @xmath8 which commute with the gaudin hamiltonians ? clearly , the @xmath18-fold tensor product @xmath19 of the center @xmath20 of @xmath4 is the center of @xmath8 , and its elements obviously commute with the @xmath21 s . as shown in @xcite , if @xmath0 has rank grater than one , then in addition to the gaudin hamiltonians and the central elements there are other elements in @xmath8 of orders higher than two which commute with the gaudin operators and with each other ( but explicit formulas for them are much more complicated and unknown in general ) .",
    "adjoining these `` higher gaudin hamiltonians '' to the @xmath21 s together with the center @xmath19 , we obtain a large commutative subalgebra of @xmath8",
    ". we will call it the _ gaudin algebra _ and denote it by @xmath22 .",
    "the construction of @xmath22 will be recalled in section  [ higher gaudin ] .",
    "the key point is the realization of @xmath8 as the space of _ coinvariants _ of induced modules over the affine kac - moody algebra @xmath1 on the projective line . using this realization ,",
    "we obtain a surjective map from the center of the completed universal enveloping algebra of @xmath1 at the _ critical level _ onto @xmath22 .",
    "the next natural question is what is the spectrum of @xmath22 , i.e. , the set of all maximal ideals of @xmath22 , or equivalently , algebra homomorphisms @xmath23 . knowing the answer is important ,",
    "because then we will know how to think about the common eigenvalues of the higher gaudin operators on the tensor products @xmath24 of @xmath0-modules .",
    "these common eigenvalues correspond to points of the spectrum of @xmath22 .",
    "the answer comes from the description of the center of the completed universal enveloping algebra of @xmath1 at the critical level .",
    "in @xcite it is shown that the spectrum of this center ( more precisely , the center of the corresponding vertex algebra ) is canonically identified with the space of the so - called @xmath25-_opers _",
    ", where @xmath25 is the _ langlands dual lie group _ to @xmath0 ( of adjoint type ) , on the formal disc .",
    "this result leads us to the following description of the spectrum of the algebra @xmath22 of higher gaudin hamiltonians : it is the space of @xmath25-opers on @xmath26 with regular singularities at the points @xmath7 and @xmath27 .",
    "we obtain this description from some basic facts about the spaces of coinvariants from @xcite .",
    "recall that the space of coinvariants @xmath28 is defined in @xcite for any ( quasi - conformal ) vertex algebra @xmath29 , a smooth projective curve @xmath30 , a collection @xmath31 of distinct points of @xmath30 and a collection of @xmath29-modules @xmath32 attached to those points .",
    "suppose that @xmath29 is a commutative vertex algebra , and so in particular it is a commutative algebra .",
    "suppose that the spectrum of @xmath29 is the space @xmath33 of certain geometric objects , such as @xmath25-opers , on the disc @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "then a @xmath29-module is the same as a smooth module over the complete topological algebra @xmath35 of functions on @xmath36 , which is the space of our objects ( such as @xmath25-opers ) on the punctured disc @xmath37 .",
    "suppose in addition that each @xmath29-module @xmath17 is the space of functions on a subspace @xmath38 of @xmath36 ( with its natural @xmath39-module structure ) .",
    "then the space of coinvariants @xmath28 is naturally a commutative algebra , and its spectrum is the space of our objects ( such as @xmath25-opers ) on @xmath40 whose restriction to the punctured disc @xmath41 around @xmath42 belongs to @xmath43 .",
    "for example , if @xmath44 , then @xmath45 , and @xmath46-opers are the same as second order differential operators @xmath47 acting from sections of the line bundle @xmath48 to sections of @xmath49 .",
    "a @xmath46-oper on @xmath26 with regular singularities at @xmath7 and @xmath27 may be written as the fuchsian differential operator of second order with regular singularities at @xmath7 , @xmath50 satisfying the condition @xmath51 that insures that it also has regular singularity at @xmath27 . defining such an operator is the same as giving a collection of numbers @xmath52 , such that @xmath51 .",
    "the set @xmath53 is then the spectrum of the gaudin algebra @xmath22 , which in this case is the polynomial algebra generated by the casimir operators @xmath54 , and the gaudin hamiltonians @xmath21 , subject to the relation @xmath55 .",
    "in other words , the numbers @xmath56 record the eigenvalues of the @xmath57 s , while the numbers @xmath58 record the eigenvalues of the @xmath21 s .    for a general simple",
    "lie algebra @xmath0 , the gaudin algebra @xmath59 has many more generators , and its spectrum does not have such a nice system of coordinates as the @xmath56 s and the @xmath58 s in the above example",
    ". therefore the description of the spectrum as a space of @xmath25-opers is very useful . in particular",
    ", we obtain that common eigenvalues of the higher gaudin hamiltonians are encoded by @xmath25-opers on @xmath26 , with regular singularities at prescribed points .",
    "these @xmath25-opers appear as generalizations of the above second order fuchsian operators .",
    "next , we ask which points in the spectrum of @xmath22 might occur as the common eigenvalues on particular tensor products @xmath16 .",
    "we answer this question first in the case when each @xmath17 admits a central character : namely , it turns out that the central character of @xmath17 fixes the residue of the @xmath25-oper at the point @xmath60 .",
    "we then show that if all @xmath0-modules @xmath17 are finite - dimensional and irreducible , then the @xmath25-opers encoding possible eigenvalues of the higher gaudin hamiltonians in @xmath16 necessarily have _ trivial monodromy representation_.    we conjecture that there is a bijection between the eigenvalues of the gaudin hamiltonians on @xmath16 , where the @xmath17 s are irreducible finite - dimensional @xmath0-modules , and @xmath25-opers on @xmath26 with prescribed singularities at @xmath61 and trivial monodromy .",
    "thus , we obtain a correspondence between two seemingly unrelated objects : the eigenvalues of the generalized gaudin hamiltonians and the @xmath25-opers on @xmath26 .",
    "the connection between the eigenvalues of the gaudin operators and differential operators of some sort has been observed previously , but it was not until @xcite that this phenomenon was explained conceptually .",
    "we present a more geometric description the @xmath25-opers without monodromy ( which occur as the eigenvalues of the gaudin hamiltonians ) as isomorphism classes of holomorphic maps from @xmath26 to @xmath62 , the flag manifold of @xmath25 , satisfying a certain transversality condition .",
    "for example , if @xmath63 , they may be described as holomorphic maps @xmath64 whose derivative vanishes to prescribed orders at the marked points @xmath7 and @xmath27 , and does not vanish anywhere else ( these orders correspond to the highest weights of the finite - dimensional representations inserted at those points ) .",
    "if the @xmath25oper is non - degenerate ( in the sense explained in section  [ from ] ) , then we can associate to it an eigenvector of the gaudin hamiltonians called a _ bethe vector_. the procedure to construct eigenvectors of the gaudin hamiltonians that produces these vectors is known as the _ bethe ansatz_. in @xcite we explained that this procedure can also be understood in the framework of coinvariants of @xmath1-modules of critical level . we need to use a particular class of @xmath1-modules , called the _",
    "wakimoto modules_.    let us recall that the wakimoto modules of critical level are naturally parameterized by objects closely related to opers , which we call _",
    "miura opers_. they may also be described more explicitly as certain connections on a particular @xmath65-bundle @xmath66 on the punctured disc , where @xmath65 is the cartan subgroup of @xmath25 .",
    "the center acts on the wakimoto module corresponding to a cartan connection by the miura transformation of this connection ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the idea of @xcite was to use the spaces of coinvariants of the tensor product of the wakimoto modules to construct eigenvectors of the generalized gaudin hamiltonians .",
    "we found in @xcite that the eigenvalues of the gaudin hamiltonians on these vectors are encoded by the @xmath67-opers which are obtained by applying the miura transformation to certain cartan connections on @xmath26 .",
    "more precisely , the bethe vector depends on an @xmath68-tuple of complex numbers @xmath69 , where @xmath70 , with an extra datum attached to each of them , @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the set of nodes of the dynkin diagram of @xmath0 ( or equivalently , the set of simple roots of @xmath0 ) .",
    "these numbers have to be distinct from the @xmath60 s and satisfy the following system of _ bethe ansatz equations _ :",
    "@xmath73 where @xmath74 denotes the highest weight of the finite - dimensional @xmath0-module @xmath75 .",
    "we can compute explicitly the @xmath25-oper encoding the eigenvalues of the generalized gaudin hamiltonians on this vector .",
    "as shown in @xcite , this @xmath25-oper is obtained by applying the miura transformation of the connection @xmath76 on the @xmath65-bundle @xmath66 on @xmath26 .",
    "this @xmath67-oper automatically has trivial monodromy .",
    "the bethe vector corresponding to a solution of the system is a highest weight vector in @xmath77 of weight @xmath78 so it can only be non - zero if @xmath79 is a dominant integral weight of @xmath0 .",
    "but it is still interesting to describe the set of _ all _ solutions of the bethe ansatz equations , even for non - dominant weights @xmath79 .",
    "while the eigenvalues of the gaudin hamiltonians are parameterized by @xmath25-opers , it turns out that the solutions of the bethe ansatz equations are parameterized by the ( non - degenerate ) miura @xmath25-opers .",
    "as mentioned above , those may in turn be related to very simple objects , namely , connections on an @xmath65-bundle @xmath66 of the kind given above in formula .",
    "a @xmath25-oper on a curve @xmath30 is by definition a triple @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is a @xmath25-bundle on @xmath30 , @xmath82 is a connection on @xmath81 and @xmath83 is a reduction of @xmath81 to a borel subgroup @xmath84 of @xmath25 , which satisfies a certain transversality condition with @xmath82 .",
    "a miura @xmath25-oper is by definition a quadruple @xmath85 where @xmath86 is another @xmath84-reduction of @xmath81 , which is preserved by @xmath82 .",
    "the space of miura opers on a curve @xmath30 whose underlying oper has regular singularities and trivial monodromy representation ( so that @xmath81 is isomorphic to the trivial bundle ) is isomorphic to the _ flag manifold _",
    "@xmath62 of @xmath25 . indeed , in order to define the @xmath84-reduction @xmath86 of such @xmath81 everywhere , it is sufficient to define it at one point @xmath87 and then use the connection to `` spread '' it around . but choosing a @xmath84-reduction at one point means choosing an element of the twist of @xmath62 by @xmath88 , and so we see that the space of all reductions is isomorphic to the flag manifold of @xmath25 .",
    "the relative position of the two reductions @xmath83 and @xmath89 at each point of @xmath30 is measured by an element @xmath90 of the weyl group @xmath91 of @xmath92 .",
    "the two reductions are in generic relative position ( corresponding to @xmath93 ) almost everywhere on @xmath30 .",
    "the mildest possible non - generic relative positions correspond to the simple reflections @xmath94 from @xmath91 .",
    "we call a miura oper on @xmath26 with marked points @xmath7 _ non - degenerate _ if the two reductions @xmath95 and @xmath96 are in generic position at @xmath7 , and elsewhere on @xmath26 their relative position is either generic or corresponds to a simple reflection .",
    "we denote the points where the relative position is not generic by @xmath97 ; each point @xmath98 comes together with a simple reflection @xmath99 , or equivalently a simple root @xmath100 attached to it .",
    "it is then easy to see that this collection satisfies the equations , and conversely any solution of corresponds to a non - degenerate miura oper ( or to an @xmath101-connection ) .",
    "thus , we obtain that there is a bijection between the set of solutions of ( for all possible collections @xmath102 ) and the set of non - degenerate miura @xmath25-opers such that the underlying @xmath67-opers have prescribed residues at the points @xmath61 and trivial monodromy .",
    "now let us fix @xmath103 and @xmath79 .",
    "then every @xmath25-oper @xmath104 on @xmath26 with regular singularities at @xmath7 and @xmath27 and with prescribed residues corresponding to @xmath103 and @xmath79 and trivial monodromy admits a horizontal @xmath84-reduction @xmath86 satisfying the conditions of a non - degenerate miura oper . since these are open conditions , we find that for such @xmath7 the non - degenerate miura oper structures on a particular @xmath25-oper @xmath104 on @xmath26 form an open dense subset in the set of all miura oper structures on @xmath104 .",
    "but the set of all miura structures on a given @xmath25-oper @xmath104 is isomorphic to the flag manifold @xmath62 .",
    "therefore we find that the set of non - degenerate miura oper structures on @xmath104 is an open dense subset of @xmath62 !",
    "recall that the set of all solutions of the bethe ansatz equations is the union of the sets of non - degenerate miura oper structures on all @xmath25-opers with trivial monodromy .",
    "hence it is naturally a disjoint union of subsets , parameterized by these @xmath67-opers .",
    "we have now identified each of these sets with an open and dense subset of the flag manifold @xmath62 .",
    "let us summarize our results :    * the eigenvalues of the hamiltonians of the gaudin model associated to a simple lie algebra @xmath0 on the tensor product of finite - dimensional representations are encoded by @xmath25-opers on @xmath26 , where @xmath25 is the langlands dual group of @xmath92 , which have regular singularities at the marked points @xmath61 and trivial monodromy ; * if such an oper @xmath104 is non - degenerate , then we can associate to it a solution of the bethe ansatz equations , which gives rise to the bethe eigenvector of dominant integral weight whose eigenvalues are encoded by @xmath104 ; * there is a one - to - one correspondence between the set of all solutions of the bethe ansatz equations and the set of non - degenerate miura opers corresponding to a fixed @xmath25-oper ; * the set of non - degenerate miura opers corresponding to the same underlying @xmath25-oper is an open dense subset of the flag manifold @xmath62 of the langlands dual group , and therefore the set of all solutions of the bethe ansatz equations is the union of certain open dense subsets of the flag manifold of the langlands dual group , one for each @xmath25-oper .    finally , to a degenerate @xmath25oper we can also attach , at least in some cases , an eigenvector of the gaudin hamiltonians by generalizing the bethe ansatz procedure , as explained in section  [ last ] .",

    "the most general and most difficult case is when some of the elements @xmath1161 are not equal to @xmath14 and some of the elements @xmath1162 are not simple reflections . in this case , as explained above , we still believe that there exists an eigenvector of @xmath22 with eigenvalue @xmath104 in @xmath1169 . but this eigenvector can not be constructed directly , by using the wakimoto modules , as above . indeed , our construction using the wakimoto modules gives eigenvectors in @xmath1200 , but we expect that in this most degenerate case the eigenvector in @xmath1169 can not be lifted to an eigenvector in @xmath1200 ( only to a generalized eigenvector ) .",
    "however , one can probably obtain this eigenvector by considering families of eigenvectors corresponding to small perturbations of the @xmath60 s or @xmath74 s .",
    "finally , there is a question as to whether all of the eigenvectors constructed by means of the wakimoto module construction ( including the bethe vectors ) are non - zero .",
    "it was conjectured by s. chmutov and i. scherbak in @xcite that the bethe vectors are always non - zero for @xmath1219 .",
    "[ conjecture ] for any set of integral dominant weights @xmath437 and an arbitrary collection of distinct complex numbers @xmath7 there is a bijection between the set @xmath1006 and the spectrum of the gaudin algebra @xmath22 in @xmath1169 ( not counting multiplicities ) .",
    "we do not know whether one can prove this conjecture by following the strategy outlined above .",
    "rather , one should view the above discussion only as an explanation of the link between this conjecture and the traditional bethe ansatz conjectures .",
    "what we have in mind is a completely different approach to proving this conjecture that is suggested by the geometric langlands correspondence .",
    "we conclude this section by briefly outlining this approach .    as explained in @xcite (",
    "following the work @xcite of a. beilinson and v. drinfeld ) , to each @xmath25oper @xmath1057 one assigns a @xmath607module @xmath1220 on the moduli stack @xmath1221 of @xmath92bundles on @xmath26 with @xmath106reductions at the points @xmath61 .",
    "this @xmath607module is a hecke eigensheaf whose `` eigenvalue '' is the flat @xmath67bundle on @xmath1222 obtained by forgetting the @xmath84reduction of @xmath104 .",
    "this flat @xmath25bundle has trivial monodromy and hence is isomorphic to the restriction to @xmath1222 of the trivial flat @xmath67bundle on @xmath26 .    on the other hand",
    ", one can show that the @xmath607module that we construct on @xmath1221 `` does not depend '' on the @xmath106reductions at the points @xmath60 and @xmath27 , i.e. , it is a pull - back from a @xmath607module @xmath1223 on the moduli stack @xmath1224 of @xmath92bundles on @xmath26 .",
    "this @xmath607module is a hecke eigensheaf whose eigenvalue is the trivial @xmath25bundle with the trivial connection .",
    "we expect that the following two properties hold : ( a ) the hecke eigensheaf @xmath1223 is non - zero for any @xmath1084 , and ( b ) the restriction of any non - zero hecke eigensheaf on @xmath1224 to @xmath1225 is necessarily also non - zero .",
    "suppose that these properties hold ( in the case of @xmath145 property ( a ) can be proved using the sklyanin separation of variables discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "then we obtain that the restriction of the @xmath607module @xmath1227 on @xmath1221 to @xmath1226 is a pull - back of a non - zero @xmath607module on @xmath1225 , and hence is isomorphic to a direct sum of copies of its structure sheaf , considered as a @xmath607module .",
    "this , in turn , is equivalent to the existence of a non - zero eigenvector of the gaudin algebra with eigenvalue @xmath104 in @xmath1169 , as explained in @xcite .",
    "hence we obtain a proof of conjecture  [ conjecture ] .",
    "we hope to return to this question in a future publication .",
