    "the similar age of the stars in open clusters make them vital objects for the study of stellar evolution",
    ". however , for such studies , it is essential to separate the field stars from the cluster members . proper motions ( pms ) of the stars in the region of open clusters provide a unique possibility of getting membership information of the stars .",

    "this prompted us to use the local - transformation method to derive pms .",
    "detailed descriptions about the distortion solution is given in paper  i.    in the local transformation approach a small set of local reference stars is selected around each target object .",
    "it is advantageous to use pre - selected cluster members to form a local reference frame because of a much lower intrinsic velocity dispersion among the cluster members .",
    "then , six - parameter linear transformations are used to transform the coordinates from one frame into another , taken at different epochs .",
    "a general linear transformation from one frame @xmath26 into another @xmath27 has 6 parameters , and can be put into the following form : + @xmath28= \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } a~~ b\\\\c~~ d \\end{array } \\right ] \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } x - x_0\\\\y - y_0 \\end{array } \\right ] + \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } u_0\\\\v_0 \\end{array } \\right]$ ] + the parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the linear terms , and @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the constant terms .",
    "the equation look like there are 8 free parameters in the equations , but we can choose the zero - point in one frame arbitrarily , so only one of the two offsets is actually solved for . the easiest way to solve for the offsets is to adopt the centroid of the star list in the first frame as the offset for that frame , @xmath35 .",
    "then , the centroid in the other frame will be the least - squares solution for the other offset , ( @xmath36 .",
    "the residuals of this transformation are characterizing relative pms convolved with measurement errors .",
    "in essence , this is a classical `` plate pair '' method but extended to all possible combinations of the first and second epoch frames .",
    "relative pm of a target object is the average of all displacement measurements in its local reference frame .",
    "the last step is to estimate the measurement errors from intra - epoch observations where pms have a zero contribution .",
    "a complete description of all steps leading to pms is given in paper  i.      in order to transform instrumental @xmath2 and @xmath3 magnitudes into the standard johnson - cousin system , we used the data published by moitinho et al .",
