    "positron annihilation is one of the key tools in modern investigations of the fermi surface ( fs ) of solids @xcite , alongside quantum oscillatory techniques , compton scattering and angle - resolved photoemission . unlike other methods",
    ", however , the positron probe itself plays a crucial role in the measured distribution , preferentially annihilating with those electrons that are most able to screen its charge . in a typical metal ,",
    "free from vacancy - type defects , the electrons that are most readily able to screen are , of course , those at the fs , advantageously leading to an enhancement of the signal contributed from electrons at the fs .",
    "attempts to account for this enhanced contribution have , for the most part , relied on detailed studies of the electron - positron interaction within the jellium model @xcite , which is now essentially well - understood @xcite .",
    "however , such schemes are yet to achieve good agreement with experiment when applied to a wide range of metallic systems . here",
    ", we consider this problem from an experimental perspective , _ measuring _ the state - dependent enhancement factor for some simple elemental metals , and present a phenomenological ( and empirical ) correction to the work of barbiellini , alatalo and their co - workers @xcite that offers excellent agreement with experiment .    the complex many - body interaction between the positron and the electron gas has been intensively studied for many years @xcite .",
    "when the positron enters a homogeneous electron gas , the attractive coulomb interaction polarizes the electron gas in the vicinity of the positron , leading to a cusp in the unscreened electron density at the positron s position and the associated enhancement of the partial annihilation rate of those electrons that screen the charge .",
    "the theory of kahana @xcite predicted a momentum - dependent enhancement , in which the enhancement increases towards the fermi momentum , @xmath3 , and corresponds to the increased capability of electrons near the fermi level to screen the positron s charge , compared with lower - lying electron states .",
    "however , the inhomogeneity of the electron gas in real lattices can have a strong influence on the enhancement , even hiding the kahana - like momentum dependence @xcite .",
    "it is worth pointing out that when considering enhancement there are actually two separate , but related issues .",
    "firstly , in the context of calculating the correct positron lifetimes in solids , the enhancement of the total electron density needs to be properly described in order to calculate the positron annihilation rate .",
    "secondly , a description of the enhancement is needed when calculating the two - photon momentum densities ( which are the focus of the current paper ) .",
    "the former problem is easier because the contact density can be parameterized in terms of the local electron and positron densities ( using the many - body results for jellium ) , but the latter is a more difficult problem since in the framework of density functional theory there is no formally exact way to calculate the two - photon momentum density @xcite ( and as such all models in the literature are , in practice , empirical ) .",
    "local density parameterizations , in which the enhancement is parameterized as a function of the unscreened electron density , @xmath4 , at the positron , have been introduced to account for the inhomogeneity of real systems . in these approaches ,",
    "the enhancement is usually expressed in terms of the electron gas parameter , @xmath5 , of which it is a monotonically increasing function for typical crystallographic electron densities .",
    "some popular choices are the expressions of arponen and pajanne @xcite , based on boson formalism and parameterized by barbiellini and co - workers @xcite , and those of boroski and nieminen ( bn ) which are based upon an interpolation of fermi liquid results due to lantto @xcite .",
    "jarlborg and singh ( js ) have used a local - density approach to solve a two - body electron - positron schrdinger equation inside a spherical correlation cell that yields good agreement with transition metals and their alloys for both momentum densities @xcite and positron lifetimes @xcite , and is a common choice to describe the enhancement of the momentum distribution in metals @xcite .",
    "more general parameterizations have been proposed @xcite that include kahana - like momentum or energy dependence to describe the results of positron measurements .",
    "more recently , theoretical prescriptions for the enhancement have been developed that represent a significant departure from the homogeneous electron gas or local - density approaches , based on , for example , the generalized gradient approximation @xcite , bloch - modified ladder @xcite or weighted - density approximation @xcite .",
    "owing to the different screening properties of @xmath2 and @xmath0-@xmath1 electrons , efforts to include a character , or state - dependent enhancement function have been applied to several transition metals and their alloys @xcite .",
    "ob applied such a scheme to data measured on a polycrystalline feal alloy , finding a de - enhancement of the @xmath2 states by a factor of @xmath6 compared with the @xmath0-@xmath1 states @xcite , whereas the application of the same procedure by svoboda and ob @xcite to cuzn was found to favor a reduction by a factor of @xmath7 . theoretically , such explicit state - dependence is rarely included , although for flat @xmath2-bands it is implicitly present in any energy - dependent model .",
    "recently , barbiellini and co - workers have developed a theoretical and _ ab initio _ state - dependent prescription for calculating the enhancement in a general system @xcite , which is based on the state - dependent annihilation rates calculated within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) .",
    "although it has been demonstrated that the effects of enhancement do not shift the location in * k*-space of the fermi breaks in positron measurements @xcite , the influence of the theoretical treatment of the enhancement , when rigid - band like shifts are applied to the electronic structure and compared with experiment , has not yet been investigated .    here",
    ", we tackle the problem of describing the enhancement of the positron annihilation rates from an experimental perspective . employing a state - dependent ( sd ) model for the enhancement similar to that of ref.@xcite , we simultaneously fit both the fs and the enhancement from _ ab initio _ electronic structure calculations to positron data directly in * k*-space in order to obtain a quantitative _ measurement _ of the enhancement in metals .",

    ", @xmath45 is a universal quantity , representing the partial enhancement of a state with character @xmath39 .",
    "the degree to which it is enhanced depends on the coefficients of the wavefunctions in the lmto calculation . the enhancement , then , of a pure state of atomic species @xmath4 and orbital character @xmath39 is given by @xmath47 .",
    "note that the band characters ( atomic species and orbital character ) are strongly @xmath48-dependent , and of course vary from band to band due to hybridization with other states , so our enhancement model is a general state - dependent model for the enhancement ( see , for example , fig .",
    "[ f : gammak ] ) , but has its origins in the convenient properties of the lmto wavefunctions .",
    "the contribution due to core annihilations is an important consideration for positron lifetime calculations @xcite .",

    ", the contribution from core states in the data is described by a uniform background in the subsequent fitting procedure .      in the rigid - band approach , the agreement between experiment and theory is iteratively maximized with respect to a rigid shift of one or more of the energy bands ( typically those that constitute the fs ) , until convergence at the minimum of the goodness - of - fit parameter is achieved .",
    "this is similar to the method of ref .",
    "@xcite , however , there are some important differences . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the radial anisotropy of the two - photon momentum density in * p*-space served as the comparative quantity , and the enhancement was fixed to that chosen in its initial calculation ( in that case , the js model was used ) .",
    "here , we perform our comparison in * k*-space , corresponding to the lock - crisp - west - folded data , and explicitly include enhancement of the form outlined above ( sd model ) in the fitting . the advantage of operating in * k*-space ( aside from the smaller array sizes involved ) is principally that we are sensitive directly to the projected fermi breaks , rather than the many weaker fs signatures that are distributed throughout the * p*-space spectrum . an additional consideration , however , is the contribution from higher momentum components ( umklapp processes ) , whose enhancement has presented a challenge for theoretical models ( see , for example , ref .",
    "it is noted that operating in * k*-space involves the folding of the umklapp contributions into the first bz , both experimentally and theoretically , and that any non - trivial behavior of these contributions is subsequently lost .",
    "however , we have checked our results with the equivalent * p*-space spectra , and in particular near the umklapp regions ( as well as its integral , which represents an analogue of the coincidence doppler broadening spectra ) .",
    "crucially , we find the data are equally well - reproduced using such a * k*-space approach as they are with the traditional js model .",
    "the fitting parameters constitute the energy shift , @xmath50 , for each band in the fit ( typically those that cross @xmath51 ) , two scaling parameters for each experimental projection , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , that approximately relate to the @xmath54-independent core contribution and the number of counts in the 2d - acar spectra respectively , and the enhancement parameters , @xmath42 , of which there are typically three for simple systems .",
    "these are simultaneously adjusted using the minuit package @xcite and the computed * k*-space density is compared with the data until convergence is reached .",
    "note that we fit the ratios of the enhancement parameters , absorbing their magnitude into the scaling parameters ( the absolute magnitude of the enhancement parameters is indistinguishable from the scaling parameters in the data ) .",
    "our definition and treatment of the scaling parameters have an important consequence . as mentioned above",
    ", we do not treat the enhancement of the core electrons , preferring to concentrate on the description of the shape of the rmd .",
    "such an approach means that good agreement can be obtained with the ipm if we consider a _ negative _ contribution from core annihilations .",
    "whilst this is clearly unphysical , it stems from the strong overestimation of the enhancement of deeply - bound electrons within the ipm . here",
    ", we are most interested in the band properties of the momentum distribution ( i.e.  its _ shape _ ) , and in particular its fs signatures .",
    "we point out that in the following discussion , even when the ipm appears to give reasonable agreement with our data , the agreement with positron lifetime measurements ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) would be very poor , in contrast to the other enhancement models that are addressed here .",
    "the transition metals and their alloys have traditionally been the subject of the bulk of experimental investigations of the fs , and a good description of the electron - positron momentum density and enhancement of such systems has been vital in understanding 2d - acar , and indeed coincidence doppler broadening @xcite data .",
    "the js model was specifically developed with transition metals in mind , and is generally thought to provide a good description of the enhancement for @xmath2-electron densities ( with @xmath55 ) @xcite . here ,",
    "we begin by applying the sd enhancement model described above to some metals whose fss have been accurately determined via quantum - oscillatory methods ( ag , v ) and one whose fs is inaccessible to conventional fs probes ( paramagnetic cr ) , first concentrating on the `` raw '' lmto calculations of the rmd .",
    "comparisons are made with both the ipm and the js model for enhancement , as well as a simplified version of the barbiellini - alatalo @xcite enhancement scheme . following this",

    "<S> is shown to yield a measurement of the enhancement of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 states , independent of any parameterizations in terms of the unscreened electron density local to the positron . </S>",
    "<S> an empirical correction that can be applied to a first - principles state - dependent model is proposed that reproduces the measured state - dependence very well , yielding a general model for the enhancement of the momentum distribution of positron annihilation measurements , including those of angular correlation and coincidence doppler broadening techniques . </S>"
