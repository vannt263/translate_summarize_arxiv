    "the study of transiting exoplanets has undergone a remarkable evolution since the first transit detection in hd  209458b @xcite .",
    "projects such as the hungarian automated telescope network ( hatnet ) @xcite , and superwasp @xcite are routinely detecting new transiting planets .",
    "results from the nasa kepler mission are breaking new ground by discovering planets that are smaller and at longer orbital periods than those accessible from ground - based surveys @xcite .",
    "however , the most important transiting planets for follow - up observations and characterization of atmospheres continue to be those discovered first by the radial velocity ( rv ) method , because of the bias towards bright host stars .",
    "the transit ephemeris refinement and monitoring survey ( terms ) seeks to provide more of these opportunites through orbital refinement @xcite , particularly for planets in eccentric orbits with higher transit probabilities @xcite .",
    "terms also allows the study of long - term variability of the host star such that it can be correlated with the stellar magnetic activity cycle in the context of being a planet - host @xcite .",
    "multi - planet systems present particularly interesting cases since studying the dynamical interaction of the planets is an additional advantage to refining the orbits .",
    "one such terms target is the planetary system orbiting hd  38529 , whose planets have been discovered via precision rv measurements .",
    "the inner planet is in a @xmath0  day orbit and was discovered by @xcite .",
    "the second planet , in a @xmath1  year orbit , was discovered by @xcite .",
    "the system was further investigated in the context of multi - planet systems by @xcite and @xcite , both of whom provided new rv data and revised orbits for the planets .",
    "@xcite furthered the studies of the system by providing new rv data as well as hubble space telescope astrometry .",
    "their analysis indicated that there may be an additional planet located at an orbital period of @xmath2  days , though this was not confirmed by their observations and they encouraged further study to help resolve the issue .",

    "we performed interferometric observations of the host star using the chara array to determine a direct measurement of the radius , which we compare with that derived from an analysis of high - resolution spectra .",
    "we provide new rv data for the system , improving the orbits of the planets and greatly extending the time baseline .",
    "our analysis of the combined data finds no evidence for a third planet located near 194 days . from these new data ,",
    "we calculate an accurate transit ephemeris and predict the parameters of a potential transit of hd  38529b .",
    "we present 12 years of precision photometry of hd  38529 acquired with an automated photoelectric telescope ( apt ) at fairborn observatory .",
    "these observations rule out a transit of the inner planet .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate that the host star exhibits a cyclic brightness variation on a timescale of approximately six years which is correlated with the s - index derived from our keck i spectra .",
    "hd  38529 was observed during three nights in november 2012 using the georgia state university center for high angular resolution astronomy ( chara ) interferometric array @xcite .",
    "our observational methods and strategy are described in detail in @xcite and @xcite and references therein .",
    "we used two of chara s longest baselines ( s1e1 and e1w1 ) to perform our observations in @xmath26-band with the chara classic beam combiner @xcite in single - baseline mode .",
    "we obtained 3 , 1 , and 2 observations ( brackets ) during the nights of 3 , 4 , and 12 november 2012 , each of which contains approximately 2.5 minutes of integration and 1.5 minutes of telescope slewing per object ( target and calibrator ) . to remove the influence of atmospheric and instrumental systematics , interferometric observations consist of bracketed sequences of object and calibrator stars , chosen to be near - point - like sources of similar brightness as hd  38529 and located at small angular distances from it .",
    "we originally used both hd  37077 and hd  36777 as calibrators but eliminated the latter due to the presence of a second fringe packet in each observation , indicating that hd  36777 may be an unresolved binary .    to protect against unknown systematics in interferometric data ,",
    "we ordinarily require the use of at least two calibrators , two baselines , and data obtained during at least two nights @xcite .",

    "these functions may be described as @xmath30-order bessel functions of the angular diameter of the star , the projected distance between the two telescopes , and the wavelength of observation ( see equations 2 and 4 of @xcite ) .",
    "visibility is the normalized amplitude of the correlation of the light from two telescopes .",
    "it is a unitless number ranging from 0 to 1 , where 0 implies no correlation and 1 implies perfect correlation .",
    "an unresolved source would have a perfect correlation of 1.0 independent of the distance between the telescopes ( baseline ) .",
    "a resolved object will show a decrease in visibility with increasing baseline length .",
    "the shape of the visibility versus baseline is a function of the topology of the observed object ( the fourier transform of the object s shape ) . for a uniform disk",
    "this function is a bessel function , and for this paper , we use a simple model for limb - darkening variation of a uniform disk .",
    "the visibility of any source is reduced by a non - perfect interferometer , and the point - like calibrators are needed to calibrate out the loss of coherence caused by instrumental effects .",
    "we use the linear limb - darkening coefficient @xmath31 from the atlas models in @xcite for stellar @xmath32 = 5500  k and @xmath21 = 4.0 to convert from @xmath3 to @xmath5 .",
    "the uncertainties in the adopted limb darkening coefficient amount to 0.2% when modifying the adopted gravity by 0.5  dex or the adopted @xmath32 by 200k , well within the errors of our diameter estimate .",
    "our interferometric measurements yield the following values for hd  38529 s angular diameters : @xmath33  milliarcseconds ( mas ) and @xmath34  mas ( table  [ stellar ] ) .",
    "combined with the direct distance measurement from @xcite of @xmath35 pc , we derive a stellar radius for hd  38529 of @xmath36 , which is consistent with @xmath37 calculated by @xcite .      to calculate hd  38529 s effective temperature and luminosity",

    "we combine this with the derived host star properties to determine an accurate transit ephemeris for hd  38529b .",
    "the rv data for hd  38529 presented here comprise 436 measurements and were acquired from 3 instruments / telescopes : the high resolution spectrograph @xcite on the hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) , the hamilton echelle spectrograph @xcite on the 3.0 m shane telescope at lick observatory , and the hires echelle spectrometer @xcite on the 10.0 m keck i telescope . shown in table [ rvs ]",

    "the difference is our `` observed transit depth , ''",
    "@xmath180 mag in the sense that the mean of the transit points is slightly _ brighter _ than the mean of the out - of - transit observations but are , nevertheless , consistent with zero to four decimal places . as",
    "the lower panel shows , we have sufficient data around predicted transit times to rule out transits to a depth of @xmath128 mag .    it has been suggested by @xcite that planetary systems in 2:1 orbital resonance can be mistaken for a single planet in an eccentric orbit . if planet b has an orbital period that is half of the derived @xmath181  day period , then it would have an even higher transit probability and thus a higher chance of being detected in the photometric data .",
    "we performed a search through the 12-year photometric data set for periodic transits around 7.155 days and around 14.3 days .",
    "no transits were detected at or near either period .",
    "although a dynamical model of a 2:1 resonance would lead to aperiodic transit times , the complete phase coverage of our photometric observations over a range of periods around 14.3 days leads us to conclude that such transits are ruled out .    as noted above",
    ", the scatter in the normalized data set is slightly larger than the expected measurement precision , suggesting the presence of small starspots on hd  38529 .",
    "starspots on the photospheres of solar - type stars allow the possibility of direct determination of stellar rotation periods from rotational modulation in the visibility of the spots and the consequent variability in the star s brightness ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "spots can also produce periodic radial velocity variations that can mimic the presence of a planetary companion .",
    "therefore , we performed periodogram analyses for each of the 12 seasons of normalized photometry plotted in the top panel of figure  [ photfig1 ] and , indeed , found very low - amplitude periodic brightness variations in 8 of the 12 observing seasons .",

    "complete results are given in columns 5 & 6 of table  [ phottab ] .",
    "the seasonal photometric periods scatter about their mean with a standard deviation of @xmath182 day .",
    "the weighted mean of the 8 photometric periods is @xmath183 days , which we take to be our best determination of the star s rotation period .",
    "this period is based on far more observations than the preliminary periods of 35.7 and 31.6 days given by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the seasonal peak - to - peak amplitudes in column  6 range between 0.002 to 0.004 mag , indicating spot filling factors of only a few tenths of one percent .",
    "both the low level of spottedness and the fact that the stellar rotation period is distinctly different from the 14-day radial velocity period and its harmonics demonstrates that stellar activity ( spots and plages ) is not the source of the 14-day radial velocity period .    : a frequency spectrum of the 20042005 ( season  5 ) photometric observations of hd  38529 .",
    "the best frequency occurs at @xmath184 cycles per day .",
    "@xmath124 : the 103 season  5 observations phased with the corresponding best period of 35.7 days .",
    "the phase curve shows coherent variability with a peak - to - peak amplitude of 0.002 mag , which we take to be rotational modulation of photospheric spots .",
    "eight of the twelve observing seasons exhibit similar modulation ( see table  [ phottab]).,width=309 ]    if the inclination of hd  38529 s rotation axis is near @xmath185 , so that @xmath186 approximately equals the equatorial rotation velocity , @xmath187 , then the stellar radius and projected rotational velocity from table  [ stellar ] result in a rotation period of @xmath188 days , essentially identical to our observed value of @xmath189 days .",
    "this implies a very high inclination for the stellar rotation axis and increases the probability of transits of hd  38529b , assuming the stellar equatorial and planetary orbital planes are aligned .",
    "@xcite have shown , for instance , that the orbital planes of the hot jupiters hat - p-8b , hat - p-9b , hat - p-16b , & hat - p-23b are all closely aligned with the stellar rotation axis . in the same paper , @xcite examined 37 exoplanetary systems that have accurately measured spin - orbit angles and found that spin - orbit misalignment occurs primarily for stars with @xmath190  k ( spectral class f6 and hotter ) .",
    "thus , the orbital geometry , the high stellar inclination , and the likelihood of spin - orbit alignment are all favorable for transits of hd  38529b , making our non - detection particularly disappointing .",
    "finally , we examine long - term variability in hd  38529 s ca  ii  h  and  k indices and apt photometry to look for evidence of magnetic cycles that might induce apparent radial velocity variations and so mimic the presence of a _ long - period _ planet .",

    "recently , @xcite analyzed a sample of 304 fgk stars from the harps high - precision planet - search sample , looking for possible correlations of stellar activity cycles with radial velocity and spectral line - shape parameters .",
    "they confirmed that stellar magnetic cycles _ can _ induce long - period , low - amplitude radial velocity variations with amplitudes up to 25  ms@xmath19 in the more active stars . for hd  38529c",

    "thus , even relatively bright stars , such as hd  38529 , are worthy of further scrutiny in order to gain insight into properties of the planets hosted by the star . here",
    "we have performed just such a task by presenting the most accurate properties of the star hd  38529 so far produced .",
    "direct measurements of stellar radii via interferometry provide an essential test of stellar models and validation of radii derived from spectroscopy . in this case",
    ", we measure a radius of 2.578  r@xmath196 for hd  38529 , which is consistent with a slightly metal - rich mid - g sub - giant .",
    "the new rv data for the star are used to calculate a new keplerian orbital solution for the system that enables us to place significant limits on a previously postulated third planet .",
    "combining our mass estimate for the c component with the fgs astrometry of @xcite allows us to confirm that this object does lie within the brown dwarf mass regime .",
    "the refined transit ephemeris from the keplerian orbital solution is combined with 12 years of precision photometry to demonstrate the variability of the host star and the dispositive null detection of transits for hd  38529b .",

    "<S> the transit signature of exoplanets provides an avenue through which characterization of exoplanetary properties may be undertaken , such as studies of mean density , structure , and atmospheric composition . </S>",
    "<S> the transit ephemeris refinement and monitoring survey ( terms ) is a program to expand the catalog of transiting planets around bright host stars by refining the orbits of known planets discovered with the radial velocity technique . </S>",

    "<S> we determine fundamental properties of the host star through direct interferometric measurements of the radius and through spectroscopic analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we provide new radial velocity measurements that are used to improve the keplerian solution for the two known planets , and we find no evidence for a previously postulated third planet . </S>",
    "<S> we also present 12 years of precision robotic photometry of hd  38529 that demonstrate the inner planet does not transit and the host star exhibits cyclic variations in seasonal mean brightness with a timescale of approximately six years . </S>"
