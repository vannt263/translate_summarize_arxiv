    "the contact angle , which young  @xcite simply called angle , plays a fundamental role in various fields of surface science .",

    "[ fig:1 ] is idealized picture and there is a transition region between the bulk droplet and the thin liquid film .",
    "the information about wettability extracted from the contact angle can then be used to design useful new artificial surfaces and materials . even though , the contact angle has been used for many years to characterize the surface experimentally or empirically , a reliable theoretical method which can predict the contact angle has still not been well developed .",
    "derjaguin  @xcite , more than three decades ago , proposed a formula which relates to the contact angle and the disjoining pressure .",

    "also , several variants of derivation  @xcite of the original derjaguin formula  @xcite have been proposed . however , due to the recent advances in nan - science and nano - technology , the contact angle of the nano - scale droplet becomes measurable using an atomic force microscope ( afm )  @xcite and environmental scanning electron microscopy ( esem )  @xcite .",

    "we pointed out that the droplet is metastable and is in fact the critical nucleus of the heterogeneous nucleation  @xcite .",
    "since the droplet is the critical nucleus of nucleation , it is well know that it can exist only when the surrounding vapor is _ oversaturated _ when the substrate is incompletely wettable and is characterized by the finite macroscopic contact angle .",
    "therefore , the oversaturated vapor is necessary to maintain the hemispherical meniscus of the droplet .    on the other hand ,",
    "it is also well know  @xcite that the droplet can exist not only in the oversaturated vapor but also in the _ undersaturated _ vapor above the so - called _ prewetting _ line  @xcite .",
    "the droplet in the undersaturated vapor is not the critical nucleus of the bulk vapor - liquid phase transition but that of the surface thin - thick transition  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the droplet will not grow infinity but will only grow up to the thickness of the thick wetting film .",
    "the shape of droplet said to deviates significantly from spherical shape and is more appropriately characterized by a `` pancake '' or `` pill box '' shape .",
    "this drop in the undersaturated vapor has already been considered many years ago  @xcite before the development of the theory of surface phase transition  @xcite , and is called microdrops  @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to define a microscopic contact angle even though the macroscopic contact angle vanishes as the substrate is completely wettable  @xcite . in this article",

    "a droplet can exist on the substrate as the critical nucleus only under the oversaturated vapor above the coexistence when the substrate is incompletely wettable ( fig .",

    "of course , the droplet can also exist in the oversaturated vapor when the substrate is completely wettable as long as the pressure does not exceed the spinodal line .",
    "therefore , the droplet can exist on the completely - wettable substrate even though the macroscopic contact angle is zero  @xcite .",
    "since various properties of the droplet on a completely - wettable substrate have been studied in previous publication  @xcite , we will pay equal attention to the droplet on an incompletely - wettable substrate .    in order to study the morphology and the contact angle of the droplet on a flat substrate",
    ", we will use the interface displacement model ( idm ) , which has been extensively used to study the wetting transitions  @xcite .",

    "also , we will not use a gradient - squared approximation which can be used only when the contact angle is small  @xcite . within the idm ,",
    "the free energy functional @xmath14 of the droplet is written as @xmath15=\\int\\left[\\gamma \\left(\\left(1 + \\left(\\nabla l\\right)^{2}\\right)^{1/2}-1\\right)+v\\left ( l\\right)-\\delta pl\\right]dx \\label{eq:1z}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the liquid - vapor surface tension , @xmath17 is the interface potential  @xcite from the substrate , which is related to the so - called disjoining pressure @xmath18 through  @xcite @xmath19 and @xmath6 denotes the deviation of the vapor pressure from the liquid - vapor coexistence such that @xmath4 is the bulk liquid - vapor coexistence and for @xmath7 the vapor is oversaturated . in eq .",
