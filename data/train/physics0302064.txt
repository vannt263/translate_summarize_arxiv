    "it is a well known fact that solutions of equations determining the motion of a homogeneous inviscid fluid possess a remarkable property  the lines of the vorticity field are frozen - in @xcite .",
    "mathematical reason for this is the so called relabeling symmetry of fluids that provides necessary conditions for the noether theorem applicability and results in infinite number of the conservation laws @xcite . due to this basic property , in the framework of ideal hydrodynamics",
    "such flows are possible where during sufficiently long time interval the vorticity is concentrated in quasi - one - dimensional structures , vortex filaments , that fill a small part of entire bulk of the fluid .",
    "the motion of vortex filaments is very interesting problem both from theoretical and practical viewpoints and is a classical subject of hydrodynamics ( see , for instance , @xcite and references therein for various analytical and numerical approaches to this problem ) . in general case analytical study in this field is highly complicated because of several reasons , the main of them being non - locality and nonlinearity of governing equations of motion .",
    "a less significant trouble seems to be the necessity of some regularization procedure for the hamiltonian functional ( the total energy ) of the system in the limit of `` infinitely thin '' vortex filaments , since a logarithmic divergency takes place in some observable physical quantities ( for instance , in the velocity of displacement of curved pieces of the filament ) as the thickness decreases .",
    "however , in few limit cases the dynamics of a single vortex filament can turn out to be effectively integrable .",
    "a known and very interesting example of such integrable system is a slender non - stretched vortex filament ( in the boundless three - dimensional ( 3d ) space filled by an ideal fluid ) in the so called localized induction approximation ( lia ) , when in the energy of the filament only logarithmically large contributions from interaction of adjacent pieces are taken into account . in this approximation",
    "the hamiltonian is simply proportional to the length of the filament , resulting in conservation this quantity , thus application of the so called hasimoto transformation @xcite is appropriate and reduces the problem to ( 1 + 1)-dimensional nonlinear schroedinger equation that is known to be integrable by the inverse scattering method @xcite .    in present work",
    "another integrable case in vortex dynamics is recognized , the long - scale motion of a thin vortex filament near a flat fixed boundary .",
    "mathematically the problem of a single filament in a half - space is equivalent to the problem of two symmetric filaments in the boundless space , that allows us simplify some further calculations .",
    "our immediate purpose will be to consider the configurations of the vortex filament that satisfy the following conditions :    \\a ) the angle is everywhere small between the tangent vector on the curve determining the shape of the filament and the boundary plane ;    \\b ) the distance from an arbitrary point of the curve to the plane is small comparatively to the curvature radius at the given point but large in comparison with the thickness of the filament ;    \\c ) the filament projection on the boundary plane does not have self - intersections or closely approaching one - to - another different pieces .    in these conditions the system dynamics",
    "is known to be unstable ( the so called crow instability @xcite ) , with the instability increment directly proportional to the wave number of ( some small ) long - scale perturbation of the filament shape .",
    "it is a well known fact that such dependence of the increment is usual for a class of local @xmath1 partial differential systems that can be exactly linearized by so called hodograph transformation @xcite exchanging dependent and independent variables .",
    "this observation has served as a weighty reason to look for a natural local nonlinear approximation in description of the long - scale dynamics of a vortex filament near a flat boundary and to examine that approximation for the hodograph method applicability . as the result",
    ", a consistent derivation of the corresponding local approximate equations of motion has been performed , and also the fact has been demonstrated that the nonlinear partial differential system for two functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 determining the shape of the filament and depending on the time moment @xmath4 and on the cartesian coordinate @xmath5 is reduced by hodograph transformation to a linear equation .",
    "moreover , it is possible to choose the pair of new independent variables in such a manner that in the linear partial differential equation for the function @xmath6 the coefficients will not depend on @xmath3-variable . for this purpose",
    "it is convenient to define @xmath2-variable as double distance from a filament point to the boundary plane @xmath7 , while @xmath3-variable will be the angle between @xmath5-direction and the tangent to the filament projection on @xmath8-plane .",
    "obviously , an explicit dependence of the coefficients on @xmath3 will be absent due to the symmetry of the system with respect to rotations in @xmath8-plane .",
    "therefore separation of the variables will be possible and most simple solutions will have the form @xmath9 where @xmath0 is an arbitrary complex parameter , and the complex function @xmath10 satisfies the simple equation @xmath11 to find the complex function @xmath12 , it will be necessary to solve some ordinary linear differential equation of the second order with variable coefficients that will be considered in appropriate section of this paper .",
    "the corresponding geometrical configurations of the vortex filament strongly depend on @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , it will be shown the solutions ( [ t_lambda ] ) with real @xmath13 describe such a shape of the ( moving ) vortex filament that its projection on @xmath8-plane has two asymptotes with the angle between them @xmath14 , while in the case @xmath15 the projection has the shape of a two - branch spiral ( see the figures ) .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section ii a necessary brief review is given concerning the hamiltonian formalism adopted to the problem of frozen - in vorticity , since this approach is the most clear and compact way to treat ideal flows",
    ". then approximate local equations of motion for a vortex filament near a flat boundary are derived . in section iii",
    "we demonstrate applicability of the hodograph method and introduce variables that are most convenient for the particular problem .",
    "section iv is devoted to investigation of simple solutions obtained by the variables separation in the governing linear equation .",
    "existence itself of the ideal - hydrodynamic solutions in the form of quasi - one - dimensional vortex structures ( vortex filaments ) filling just a small part of the total fluid bulk is closely connected with the freezing - in property of the vortex lines @xcite .",
    "mathematically this property is expressed by the special form of the equation of motion for the divergence - free vorticity field @xmath16 , @xmath17,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the velocity field . since in this article",
    "we consider incompressible flows , we may write @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the 3d laplace operator . as it is known , the action of the inverse nonlocal operator @xmath21 on an arbitrary function @xmath22 is given by the formula @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the green function of the @xmath25 operator in the boundless space",
    ". hamiltonian noncanonical structure @xcite of the equations of ideal incompressible hydrodynamics is based on the relation @xmath26 where the hamiltonian functional @xmath27 is the kinetic energy of a homogeneous incompressible fluid ( with unit density ) expressed through the vorticity , @xmath28    our approach to investigation of the vortex filament motion is based on representation of the ideal homogeneous fluid flows in terms of the frozen - in vortex lines , as described , for instance , in @xcite .",
    "the special form ( [ frozen - in_omega ] ) of the equation of motion allows us express the vorticity field @xmath29 in a self - consistent manner through the shape of the vortex lines ( the so called formalism of vortex lines ) , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the 3d delta - function , @xmath32 is some 2d manifold of labels enumerating the vortex lines ( @xmath32 is determined by topological properties of a particular flow ) , @xmath33 is a label of an individual vortex line , @xmath34 is an arbitrary longitudinal parameter along the line .",
    "what is important , the dynamics of the line shape @xmath35 is determined by the variational principle @xmath36/\\delta{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ { r}$}}(\\nu,\\xi , t)=0,\\ ] ] with the lagrangian of the form @xmath37\\cdot{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ { d}$}}({\\mbox{\\boldmath $ { r}$}}))d\\xi \\,\\ , -{\\cal h}\\{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ { \\omega}$}}\\{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ { r}$}}\\}\\},\\ ] ] where the vector function @xmath38 in the case of incompressible flows must satisfy the condition @xmath39 below we choose @xmath40 .",
    "since we are going to deal with a very thin vortex filament , we will neglect the @xmath41-dependence of the shapes of individual vortex lines constituting the filament . by doing this step",
    "we exclude from further consideration all effects related to finite variable cross - section and longitudinal flows inside the filament .",
    "thus , we consider an `` infinitely narrow '' vortex string with a shape @xmath42 and with a finite circulation @xmath43 .",
    "however , the hamiltonian of such singular filament diverges logarithmically , @xmath44 in order to regularize this double integral , it is possible , as a variant , to modify the green function @xcite .",
    "for example , instead of the singular function @xmath45 one can use a smooth function like @xmath46 or some other appropriate expression depending on a parameter @xmath47 .",
    "it should be emphasized that relation @xmath48 is exactly satisfied only in the original non - regularized system , but in the case of a finite @xmath47 it is not valid on distances of order @xmath47 from the singular vortex string .",
    "thus , the meaning of vorticity in regularized models is not so simple , but nevertheless , relation ( [ v_omega_hamiltonian ] ) remains valid in any case .",
    "relatively small parameter @xmath47 in regularized models serves to imitate a finite width of vortex filament in the usual ( non - regularized ) hydrodynamics .",
    "the energy of the string turns out to be logarithmically large , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a typical scale depending on a given problem ( in particular , the usual lia uses @xmath51 const @xmath52 ) . in our case",
    "we consider two symmetric vortex filaments in the long - scale limit , when direction of the tangent vector varies weakly on a length of order @xmath53 .",
    "for such configurations , the energy concentrated in the half - space @xmath54 is approximately equal to the following expression @xmath55 this local hamiltonian is able to provide qualitatively correct dynamics of the filament down to longitudinal scales of order @xmath53 where perturbations become stable and where non - locality comes to play .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have a simple method to treat the hamiltonian ( [ lia_generalized ] ) analytically , that is why we will consider only very large scales ( @xmath56 ) and thus suppose the slope of the tangent vector to the boundary plane to be negligibly small ( this means @xmath57 ) . then , choosing as a longitudinal parameter @xmath34 simply the cartesian coordinate @xmath5 , we have the following approximate lagrangian : @xmath58 where the functions @xmath53 and @xmath59 depend on @xmath5 and @xmath4 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 . having neglected the term @xmath62 under the square root , we sacrifice correct behaviour of perturbations with wave - lengths of order @xmath53 , but instead we obtain exactly solvable system , as it will be shown below .",
    "let us say a few words about geometrical meaning of the second term in r.h.s . of the expression ( [ approx_lagrangian ] ) .",
    "since we study the very long - scale limit , locally the flow under consideration looks almost like a two - dimensional flow with a small vortex at the distance @xmath53 from the straight boundary , and the expression @xmath63 is just the energy of such 2d flow per unit length in the third ( longitudinal ) direction , while the multiplier @xmath64 gives the arc - length element in the longitudinal direction .",
    "now for simplicity we take new time and length scales to satisfy @xmath65 and @xmath66 . after",
    "that we introduce new quantities @xmath67 and @xmath68 , and also the function @xmath69 , @xmath70 where @xmath71 the corresponding equations of motion then can be written in the following remarkable general form : @xmath72 more explicitly , the last two equations are @xmath73=0 , & & \\label{rho_t}\\\\ { \\partial_t}z+f'(\\rho)\\sqrt{1+z_x^2}=0.&&\\label{z_t}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these equations have a simple geometrical treatment . indeed , eq.([z_t ] ) means if we consider the dynamics of the filament projection on @xmath8-plane , then we see an element of the projection moving in the normal to the projection tangent direction with the velocity depending only on @xmath2 and equal to @xmath74 .",
    "simultaneously , in @xmath75-direction the element of the filament moves with the velocity proportional to the @xmath8-projection curvature multiplied by the function @xmath76 , as eq.([rho_t ] ) shows .",
    "it is interesting to note that an analogous consideration can give us also long - scale hamiltonian equations of motion for a thin vortex filament in a slab of an ideal fluid between two parallel fixed boundaries at @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "one has just to define the @xmath2-variable by the formula @xmath79 and make in eq.([h_rm ] ) substitution @xmath80 where @xmath81 with a small dimensionless parameter @xmath82 .",
    "it is known that any nonlinear system of the form ( [ mu_definition])-([bernoulli_general ] ) can be locally reduced to a linear equation if we take @xmath2 and @xmath83 as new independent variables ( this is the so called hodograph method ; see , for instance , @xcite where a particular case is discussed , the 1d gas dynamics , with @xmath84 , where @xmath2 , @xmath83 , @xmath85 are the gas density , gas velocity , and the internal energy density respectively ) .",
    "indeed , as from equations ( [ mu_definition ] ) and ( [ bernoulli_general ] ) we see the relation @xmath86 it is convenient to introduce the auxiliary function @xmath87 , @xmath88 in order to obtain @xmath89 from the above expression we easily derive @xmath90 after that we rewrite eq.([contin_general ] ) in the form @xmath91 and multiply it by the jacobian @xmath92 , @xmath93 thus , now we have @xmath94 substitution of the relations ( [ tx ] ) into this equation and subsequent simplification give us the linear partial differential equation of the second order for the function @xmath87 , @xmath95    as the function @xmath69 has the special form ( [ h_rm ] ) , it is convenient to change variables , @xmath96 where @xmath3 is the angle in @xmath8-plane between @xmath5-direction and the tangent to the corresponding projection of the vortex filament . as the result , the relations ( [ chi_definition ] ) and ( [ tx ] ) will be rewritten in the form @xmath97 and the coefficients of the linear equation for the function @xmath98 will not depend on @xmath3-variable , @xmath99 the same is true for the coefficients of the equation determining the function @xmath100 , @xmath101    once some particular solution of eq.([equation_for_u_rho_theta ] ) is known , then further procedure consists in the following two steps :    \\i ) find in terms of some parameter @xmath34 the curves of constant values of the function @xmath102 .",
    "it is this point where nonlinearity comes to play , since we need to solve nonlinear equation ;    \\ii ) substitute the obtained expressions @xmath103 and @xmath104 into eqs.([x_u]-[z_u ] ) and get complete description of the filament motion , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 .",
    "thus , the long - scale local approximation ( [ approx_lagrangian ] ) turns out to be integrable in the sense it is reduced to the _ linear _ equation ( [ equation_for_u_rho_theta ] ) .",
    "however , the function @xmath98 is multi - valued in the general case",
    ". therefore statement of the cauchy problem becomes much more complicated .",
    "besides , the functions @xmath76 and @xmath108 determined by expressions ( [ f_log ] ) and ( [ f_epsilon ] ) result in _ elliptic _ linear equations as against the usual 1d gas dynamics where the corresponding equations were _ hyperbolic_. generally speaking , the ellipticity makes the cauchy problem ill - posed in the mathematical sense if initial data are not very smooth .",
    "however , in this article we will not discuss these questions , instead in the following section we will present simple particular solutions that during some time interval satisfy the applicability conditions for the long - scale approximation .",
