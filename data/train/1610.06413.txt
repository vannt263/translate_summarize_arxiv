    "a common practice to provide lifetime enhancement against fatigue and stress - corrosion cracking of metallic parts ( e.g. , critical components of aircraft engines , welds in steel structures , etc . ) is to impart , through surface - conditioning treatments such as shot peening , sand blasting , laser peening , and low plasticity burnishing , a thin surface layer of compressive residual stress on the parts so treated .",
    "the protective compressive stress induced by surface conditioning , however , may relax as a result of thermomechanical loadings experienced by the treated part after it is put into service , thus compromising the very purpose of the surface - conditioning treatment . to ensure safety and good performance ,",
    "a nondestructive technique should be developed so that retention of the protective compressive stress in the treated parts can be monitored in - situ from time to time , thereby providing a basis for deciding whether a treated part should be taken out of service for replacement or re - conditioning treatment .",
    "depending on the specific surface - conditioning technique and processing parameters , the layer of compressive residual stress typically starts from the surface and runs to a depth of about 0.3 mm to 1 or 2 mm . the residual stress @xmath0 thus created varies with depth from the surface .",
    "at the free surface the principal stress of @xmath0 which has the free surface as principal plane is zero . if another principal stress of @xmath0 is plotted against depth from the surface , the graph typically assumes the shape of a check mark with a long tail ( see fig .  2 in section 5 ) :",
    "the principal stress starts negative ( i.e. , compressive ) at the surface and goes through a quick dip , then after a blunt turn at a minimum value ( i.e. , maximum compressive stress ) increases monotonically until it becomes slightly tensile and reaches a maximum , and then decays in a long tail to approximately zero while remaining tensile . for life - prediction purposes , monitoring of not only the surface residual stress but also the profile and depth of penetration of the protective stress layer ( particularly the maximum compressive principal stresses and their locations )",
    "are required , because they all strongly affect the fatigue life and corrosion - crack resistance of the treated part .",
    "the presence of stress in a body affects the velocities of elastic waves propagating in it .",
    "this phenomenon is called the acoustoelastic effect .",
    "there is ample experimental evidence ( see , for example , @xcite ) that the presence of a surface layer of inhomogeneous residual stress in an otherwise homogeneous medium will lead to the dispersion of rayleigh waves , the quantitative data of which can be ascertained by boundary measurements . in this paper",
    "we shall explore whether we could monitor the retention of the surface - treatment induced layer of protective compressive stress by measurements of rayleigh - wave dispersion .    besides inhomogeneous stress , there are other material characteristics ( e.g. , surface roughness , inhomogeneity in crystallographic texture ) of a treated part that will lead to dispersion of rayleigh waves , often with effects comparable to or stronger than those due to initial stress ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "should some such characteristics have also changed after the treated part is put in service , other measurements in addition to rayleigh - wave dispersion would be needed to infer the depth profile of the stress . as a first step towards the development of an ultrasonic technique for monitoring stress retention in surface - treated samples , here we will restrict our discussion to the following simple situation : except for the unknown depth - dependent residual stress ,",
    "all other relevant material parameters are known .",
    "one scenario where this could happen is that we have ascertained all relevant material characteristics of the treated sample , including the residual stress imparted by surface - conditioning , before the sample is put into service .",
    "after a period of service , the protective residual stress may have suffered from partial or total relaxation , but all other material characteristics of the treated sample remain unchanged after its production .    under the theoretical framework of linear elasticity with initial stress @xcite , man et al .",
    "@xcite recently presented a general procedure for obtaining a high - frequency asymptotic formula for the dispersion of the phase velocity of rayleigh waves propagating in a vertically - inhomogeneous , prestressed and anisotropic half - space .",
    "as a further development , the general procedure given in @xcite was adapted by tanuma et al .",
    "@xcite to the case where the incremental elasticity tensor @xmath1 can be written as the sum of an isotropic part @xmath2 and a perturbative part @xmath3 . under a cartesian coordinate system where the material medium occupies the half - space @xmath4 , the perturbative part @xmath5 , the initial stress @xmath6 , and the mass density @xmath7 were assumed to be smooth functions of @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , the following linearization assumption ( * ) was made : at the free surface @xmath9 of the material medium the perturbative part @xmath10 and the initial stress @xmath11 are sufficiently small as compared with @xmath2 that for all expressions and formulas which depend on @xmath10 and @xmath11 it suffices to keep only those terms linear in the components of these tensors . under this setting , specific formulas are derived @xcite with which the procedure presented in @xcite can be implemented to compute iteratively each term of a high - frequency asymptotic formula for dispersion relations that pertain to rayleigh waves with various propagation directions .",
    "thus for rayleigh waves of sufficiently high frequencies , dispersion curves can be generated by the method developed in @xcite when requisite data on material and stress are given .",
    "once we have that capability , the inverse problem of inferring stress retention from rayleigh - wave dispersion can be attacked by an iterative approach .    the theory developed in @xcite",
    "is meant for applications that include as typical example ultrasonic measurement of stress in metal structural parts , where the perturbative part @xmath3 in the splitting @xmath12 of the incremental elasticity tensor is originated from the presence of crystallographic texture and of the prestress @xmath0 . moreover , the shifts in phase velocities of elastic waves caused by texture and initial stress ( with the latter bounded by the yield surface ) are typically within 2% of their values for the corresponding isotropic medium with @xmath13 , which suggests that linearization assumption ( * ) would be adequate . on the other hand",
    ", the theory developed in @xcite does not take into consideration the effects of surface roughness on rayleigh - wave dispersion .",
    "several empirical studies ( see e.g. , @xcite ) have shown that if rayleigh - wave dispersion is used for measurement of stress induced by shot - peening or laser - shock peening , the effect of surface roughness on the dispersion curves can not be ignored , for it can totally mask the dispersion due to inhomogeneous stress .",
    "surface conditioning by low plasticity burnishing ( lpb ) , however , is different , for lpb leaves a mirror - smooth finish on processed parts . for the dispersion of rayleigh waves which have frequencies suitable for interrogation of the compressive stress induced by lpb treatment ,",
    "surface roughness is not an issue @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will study as prime example the possibility of using the high - frequency formula for rayleigh - wave dispersion developed in @xcite to infer retention of near - surface compressive stress in a thick - plate sample of an aa 7075-t651 aluminum alloy which was surface - treated by low plasticity burnishing ( lpb ) .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we present , within the context of linear elasticity with initial stress , the constitutive equation of a prestressed medium which is a polycrystalline aggregate of cubic crystallites that carries an orthorhombic texture .",
    "details on material parameters and texture coefficients specific to the aluminum sample , which serves as the prime example of our present study , are given in appendix a. in section 3 , after we briefly outline the procedure given in @xcite to arrive at a high - frequency asymptotic formula for rayleigh - wave dispersion , we present a theorem and its corollary which will be instrumental for reducing the inverse problem in question to solving systems of linear equations iteratively .",
    "section 4 is devoted to a statement of the inverse problem on monitoring of stress retention and its solution . in section 5",
    "we apply the theory to a specific inverse problem pertaining to the aluminum sample . there after we describe how `` experimental '' data on rayleigh - wave dispersion are simulated over the frequency window from 4 mhz to 70 mhz , we use the third - order approximation of the dispersion relations to infer the depth profile of the residual stress . in our example",
    "the inferred and  real \" stress profiles match well for the range of depth from 0 to 0.7 mm . in section 6",
    "we examine the scenario in which experimental conditions ( e.g. , diffraction errors ) rule out the use of data at frequencies lower than 7 mhz .",
    "we use the second - order approximation of and the simulated data on the dispersion relations over the frequency window from 7 mhz to 70 mhz to infer the stress profile .",
    "our example shows that the inferred and  real \" stress profiles match quite well for the range of depth from 0 to 0.5 mm .",
    "we end the paper with some closing remarks in section 7 .",
    "the thick - plate sample in question ( see @xcite for details on sample preparation ) is that of an aa 7075-t651 aluminum alloy , one face of which was surface - treated by low plasticity burnishing ( lpb ) .",
    "the lpb - treatment , in general , would introduce a depth - dependent residual stress , which is compressive at and near the treated surface .",
    "it would also induce changes in material properties ( e.g. , elastic and acoustoelastic constants ) which , in the engineering literature , are qualitatively referred to as the effects of `` cold work '' . in the theory that we adopt in this paper , such effects",
    "are described quantitatively as being caused by changes in surface and near - surface crystallographic texture .",
    "we model the lpb - treated aluminum sample as a prestressed and textured polycrystalline medium , which occupies the half - space @xmath4 under a spatial cartesian coordinate system @xmath14 with @xmath15 being the treated surface whereas the 1- and 2-axis are chosen arbitrarily .",
    "we assume that the prestress and all material properties of the polycrystalline medium be macroscopically homogeneous with respect to planar translations for a fixed @xmath8 , but they may vary with @xmath8 . in what follows ,",
    "dependence of material tensors , prestress , and texture on @xmath8 will be suppressed except on occasions when we want to emphasize that dependence .",
    "let the lattice of a fixed single crystal be chosen as reference .",
    "the lattice orientation at a sampling point in the polycrystalline medium is specified by a rotation @xmath16 which brings the reference lattice to the lattice at the sampling point .",
    "the crystallographic texture @xcite of a material point in the plane defined by @xmath8 is characterized by an orientation distribution function ( odf ) @xmath17 defined on the rotation group so(3 ) . ) and ( [ d ] ) . ]",
    "following the convention adopted by roe @xcite , we endow so(3 ) with volume measure @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the haar measure with @xmath20 .",
