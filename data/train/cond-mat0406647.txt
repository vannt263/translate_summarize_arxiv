    "the field of molecular electronics@xcite is driven by the quest for functional electronic devices that are smaller than those produced by standard semiconductor technology . the microscopic size and",
    "the reproducibility in the production of molecules provide decisive advantages even if many , identical , molecules should be needed to build fault - tolerant devices a negative differential conductance ( ndc ) , a promising feature for functional devices , has been found recently in organic molecules.@xcite furthermore , many - body effects such as the coulomb blockade and kondo effect , known from semiconductor quantum dots,@xcite have been observed in molecular devices@xcite and carbon nanotubes.@xcite    since the typical single - particle level spacing of quantum dots ( or short nanotubes ) is small  often only a fraction of a mev  low temperatures are required for the resolution of transport through individual levels .",
    "low temperatures are also helpful for the observation of quantum or shot noise . for example , at temperatures above 30k noise transport through molecules between gold break junctions@xcite appears to be dominated by 1/f - like noise , believed to be generated by thermally - induced fluctuations of the gold atoms .",
    "such effects are suppressed at sub - kelvin temperatures , at which the shot noise associated with the discreteness of the charge of the transfered electrons@xcite can be detected . both the current and the shot noise depend on details of the discrete level spectrum and the coupling strengths of these levels to the electrodes.@xcite the combined measurements of current and shot noise , thus , provide a spectroscopic tool to gain information about the level structure .",
    "negative differential conductance through multi - level systems can occur when two adjacent levels have different coupling strengths to the leads .",
    "once the level with weaker coupling is occupied , transport through the other level is suppressed , which reduces the total current . for molecules",
    ", it is well known that the coupling of different molecular orbitals to the electrodes may vary strongly due to differences in the spatial structure of the corresponding wave functions.@xcite in metallic single - walled nanotubes ( swnts ) , two bands cross the fermi surface as the doping level is varied . for short tubes ,",
    "these bands break up in a set of single - particle levels , separated by a level spacing @xmath0 of about 1 mev or less ( see also ref .   for multi - walled nanotubes ) . in general , these levels differ in their spatial structure and coupling strength , particularly if they derive from two different bands at different points of the one - dimensional brillouin zone . for semiconducting nanotubes similar considerations hold.@xcite ndc has also been observed in semiconductor quantum dots.@xcite    to study transport through systems which display a ndc , we start from an effective model of a few single - particle levels with couplings to the electrodes which vary strongly from level to level , and which also may differ for the source and drain electrodes .",
    "furthermore , we include the possibility of relaxation among the levels : at finite bias voltage , electrons might enter the molecule ( quantum dot or nanotube ) at a high - lying excited state .",
    "provided that the relaxation is fast as compared to the tunneling , the molecule might relax to the ground state or other low - lying state before the electron has the chance to leave the molecule .",
    "the relaxation is accompanied by the emission of a boson , either a photon or a phonon .",
    "such relaxation processes can have a strong impact on the negative differential conductance by destroying the blocking mechanism.@xcite related models ( without coupling to a bosonic bath and relaxation ) were studied in refs .  .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to study shot noise for the model described above in the regime where ndc might occur .",
    "we predict that in the absence of relaxation , the ndc is accompanied with super - poissonian noise .",
    "this is formally similar to transport through semi - conducting resonant tunneling devices,@xcite though the origin of ndc in these devices ( chemical potential passes through the semiconductor band edge ) is entirely different from the one discussed here .",
    "relaxation processes enhance the current and reduce the noise in the ndc regime .",
    "the shot noise shows rather rich behavior depending on the coupling and relaxation strength . in particular",
    ", we find that the shot noise is a non - monotonic function of the relaxation rate .",
    "this behavior contrasts with the current , which monotonically increases as the relaxation rate becomes larger .",
    "we are able to present analytic results for the shot noise , which might be useful for the interpretation of future experiments .",
    "we also relate our results to models of transport through several quantum dots .",
    "as a model for electron transport through a molecule or nanotube with @xmath1 molecular orbitals ( levels ) and coulomb interaction we consider a generalized anderson impurity model coupled to a bosonic bath , described by the hamiltonian @xmath2 with : + @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 . here ,",

    "the charging energy @xmath14 accounts for the classical energy cost to add charge on a confined system with many electrons and ions that are not explicitly considered in the hamiltonian .",
    "in addition , the hubbard - like term with energy @xmath15 punishes double occupancy within the same orbital .",
    "these two kinds of interaction terms are the most important parts of the full two - body interactions present in a real molecule .",
    "other terms could be considered by much more elaborate models , as done in ref .   for computation of the . for the ndc / relaxation effects on the shot noise that we wish to study , the above simple molecule model suffices .",
    "tunneling between leads and molecule levels is modeled by @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the coupling strength is characterized by the intrinsic line width @xmath18 , where @xmath19 are the tunneling matrix elements . in order to allow for relaxation between different molecular levels , we add @xmath20 , which describes a bosonic bath ( where @xmath21 are the corresponding bose operators ) coupled to the molecule by the coupling constants @xmath22 .",
    "this allows relaxation processes where electrons on the molecule can change the orbital by emitting or absorbing a boson .",
    "note that a diagonal coupling , @xmath23 , would not be associated with relaxation but would give rise to `` boson - assisted tunneling '' leading to additional steps in the when the boson bath has a discrete spectrum.@xcite since in the present paper we are not interested in those boson - assisted tunneling processes , we take into account off - diagonal coupling contributions only . to be specific ,",
    "we assume in the following that the bosonic bath consists of photons , although vibrational effects due to phonons could also be described within our model . for simplicity , we assume the constants @xmath24 to be independent of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and introduce the coupling @xmath27 as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the density of states of the bosonic bath for the relaxation due to photons we choose a power law behavior @xmath30 , corresponding to photons with @xmath31 spatial degrees of freedom . for the case of phonon - mediated relaxation , which we are not going to discuss in detail in the present paper ,",

    "our perturbation expansion is valid for temperatures larger than the tunnel couplings . throughout this paper ,",

    "the molecule can acquire 16 possible states , as each level can be either unoccupied , occupied with spin @xmath103 or @xmath110 , or doubly occupied .",

    "transport is achieved by applying a bias voltage @xmath115 , which is dropped symmetrically at the electrode - molecule tunnel junctions , meaning that the energies of the molecular states are independent of the applied voltage even if the couplings @xmath107 are not symmetric .",

    "we find a negative differential conductance ( ndc ) regime , see figure  [ fig : i - s - asym ] , in dependence on the different coupling strength between the molecular orbitals and the reservoirs , as was previously discussed in refs .  .",
    "the shot noise behaves qualitatively similar , the important quantitative details are discussed in the following .",
    "if we chose equal tunnel coupling , @xmath131 ( solid line ) , we find that current and shot noise @xmath33 increase , each time , as a new transport `` channel '' ( controlled by the excitation energies ) opens .",
    "this leads to plateaus , separated by thermally broadened steps .",
    "the first four plateaus are shown and discussed in the following . at a bias voltage of @xmath132 , sequential transport through the state @xmath130 with one electron on the lower lying level",
    "becomes possible . at @xmath133 , additionally transport through the @xmath134",
    "state opens up , with the upper level being occupied with one electron .",
    "the different regions of interest are labeled by @xmath135 with @xmath124 . for a bias voltage above @xmath136 , transport channels with two or more electrons on the molecule open up . in the large - bias regime (",
    "not indicated in the plots ) and for symmetric coupling , the values @xmath126 and @xmath127 are reached .",
    "if now the coupling parameter @xmath125 is suppressed with respect to the other couplings , this leads to suppressed curves for the current and shot noise in region @xmath137 , resulting in ndc at the threshold of @xmath133 , when the state @xmath134 becomes relevant , see in fig .",
    "[ fig : i - s - asym ] for @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "the reason for the ndc is a combination of the pauli principle , coulomb blockade and suppressed coupling , as discussed in ref .  .",
    "in our case , an electron , entering the upper molecular orbital from the left electrode , can not leave the molecule , if the coupling of this orbital to the right electrode is entirely suppressed .",
    "transport through the lower molecular orbital is also not possible , since the simultaneous occupation of both orbitals is energetically forbidden in the considered bias regime .",
    "the electron gets stuck in the upper molecular orbital blocking other electrons from tunneling through the molecule .",
    "consequently , the current collapses .    since in lowest - order perturbation",
    "theory in @xmath40 the plateau _",
    "heights _ are given by the coupling parameters only , we find , that for @xmath140 ndc can be observed , whereas the shot noise is suppressed below its lower bias plateau only , if @xmath141 .",
    "this difference can already give a rough idea about the coupling strength @xmath125 for a given set of current and noise measurements .",
    "if the shot noise is sufficiently suppressed in the ndc region , a peak in the shot noise appears around the resonance energy of the second level .",
    "this peak is due to temperature induced fluctuations that in certain situations enhance the shot noise over the surrounding plateau values ( where temperature fluctuations are exponentially suppressed ) . as the resonance is approached from lower bias , within the range of temperature broadening the noise",
    "`` detects '' the opening of the second transport channel and increases .",
    "if the bias is beyond the resonance , the redistribution of occupation has taken place and the noise is algebraically suppressed .",
    "the result is the observed peak with width of the temperature .",
    "however , the peak height is only determined by the coupling parameters and is independent of the temperature .",
    "the current never shows such a peak , as it decreases proportional to the loss of occupation of the first level , the transport channel with `` good '' coupling .",
    "the effect of ndc on the fano factor , which is given by @xmath142 , is shown in figure  [ fig : fano - asym ] . at small bias , @xmath143 ,",
    "the noise is dominated by thermal noise , described by the well known hyperbolic cotangent behavior which leads to a divergence of the fano factor.@xcite the plateau for bias voltages below @xmath144 ( region @xmath145 ) corresponds to the coulomb blockade regime , where transport is exponentially suppressed . in the regions @xmath146 ( @xmath137 ) transport through the state @xmath130 ( @xmath134 ) is possible . the suppressed coupling strength @xmath125 does not affect the plateau height @xmath147 , whereas @xmath148 reaches values larger then @xmath146 , and up to @xmath31.@xcite this `` super - poissonian '' noise ( @xmath149 ) is predicted for @xmath150 . if the bias is larger then @xmath151 tunneling through states is allowed where both orbitals are occupied simultaneously , i.e. the molecule can be doubly occupied .",
    "the fano factor is sub - poissonian again ( @xmath152 ) in this regime .",
    "comparing the figures  [ fig : i - s - asym ] and [ fig : fano - asym ] graphically allows one to determine roughly the strength of the suppression of @xmath125 . in general , however , depending on the underlying energy parameters ( giving the ordering of a sequence of plateaus ) and the coupling parameters ( giving their height ) other values for the fano factor are possible . in the coulomb blockade regime ( region @xmath145 ) , for example , there can also be super - poissonian noise , if both energy levels are below the equilibrium fermi energy .",
    "super - poissonian noise is also possible for a single anderson level , if the spin degeneracy is lifted by a magnetic field ( in the coulomb blockade regime ) or by ferromagnetic leads , see refs . .",
    "the energy and coupling parameters can be fully determined only by considering several transport regimes , e.g. by application of a gate voltage .",
    "it should be noted that the non - monotonic behavior of the fano factor in regions @xmath146 and @xmath137 is entirely due to the second term of the noise expression eq .",

    "a value of @xmath155 is below even the relatively weak dipole coupling of photons to molecule states of small aromatic molecules such as benzene.@xcite for this small photon coupling ( solid line ) current and shot noise are still reduced in region @xmath137 relative to the plateau heights @xmath156 and @xmath157 in region @xmath146 .",
    "if now @xmath27 increases , we find that both @xmath32 and @xmath33 also increase in the ndc region , at least initially .",
    "if the value @xmath158 is exceeded , the ndc is gone ( see also figure  [ fig : isf - plateaus ] , dashed line ) .",
    "the behavior of the shot noise peak at the resonance energy is now further complicated by the effect of relaxation .",
    "the noise value at the resonance energy is non - monotonic , i.e. it first decreases and then increases again with increasing relaxation .",
    "this is due to redistribution of occupation by the relaxation processes in favor of the first level .    for our chosen parameters ,",
    "the value @xmath158 is larger than a reasonable molecule - photon coupling .",
    "however , phonon ( vibrational ) couplings could easily be strong enough to achieve such fast relaxation .",
    "on the other hand , molecule vibrations have a discrete spectrum , much different to the power law assumed in our calculations . relaxation due to phonons can be only effective , if the energies of a phonon and the electronic excitation match within the smearing provided by temperature .",

    "contrary to the ( monotonic ) @xmath27-dependence of the current , which can be explained by a redistribution of occupation probability form the `` blocking '' upper level to the `` conducting '' lower level , it is difficult to present a simple physical picture for the non - monotonic shot noise behavior in the ndc region . as noted above",

    "( [ s1 ] ) has a peak at about @xmath167 and a minimum at @xmath168 , where it almost reaches zero .",
    "the increase of this term at small @xmath27 is again explained by the lifting of the blockade , i.e. the redistribution of occupation probability . the decrease after the maximum is the result of a ( near ) cancellation of contributions from the different states participating in transport .",
    "some of the state contributions are negative and counter the positive contributions that produce the maximum .",
    "such a non - monotonicity with coupling parameters is only possible ( in first order perturbation theory ) for a reducible observable like the shot noise , where aside of the stationary occupation probabilities also the `` molecule propagator '' ( in the form of * p * of eq .",
    "[ def_p ] ) plays an important role .",
    "since in lowest - order perturbation theory temperature only leads to a thermal broadening of the steps , the plateau heights in the different transport regimes are given by the coupling parameters , both the tunnel coupling as well as the relaxation strength .",

    "@xmath187 we can even find fano factors with values much larger than @xmath31 , as the shot noise is strongly enhanced compared to a current that is still sizable itself ( not exponentially suppressed ) , see figure  [ fig : fano-2d ] .",
    "this again only happens for a special set of coupling parameters , thus allowing a detailed analysis of the coupling parameters , if such high values for the fano factor were observed in experiment .",
    "besides the super - poissonian noise with fano factors @xmath188 due to positive correlations and values between @xmath189 in the sub - poissonian regime , we can also find values of coupling parameters in which the fano factor drops to values below @xmath185 .",
    "this behavior , however , can only be observed in the presence of relaxations , when the coupling strength @xmath190 and @xmath125 are suppressed relative to the other tunnel couplings .",
    "if the above couplings are vanishing , there is only one path for the electrons to tunnel through the molecule , namely from the left electrode to the upper molecular orbital , then via relaxation onto the lower molecular orbital until finally the electrons leave the molecule by tunneling to the right electrode . by choosing specifically @xmath191 and @xmath192",
    "the value of the fano factor can be minimized and is found to be @xmath193 .",
    "the probabilities to find an unoccupied molecule or an occupied molecule with one electron in the lower level doublet or in upper level doublet are all equal in this case ( @xmath194 ) .",
    "this special situation reminds of a system , where a chain of quantum dots are coupled in series , having interdot tunnel couplings of the same size than the couplings of the chain ends to the leads . for an infinite chain of such dots ( effectively a one - dimensional wire )",
    "the fano factor also reaches @xmath193.@xcite    in summary , we have discussed the interplay of coulomb interactions , level - dependent coupling and relaxation in a model suitable for quantum dots , molecules and short nanotubes .",
    "we find super - poissonian shot noise in a bias region where the electronic current is suppressed due to blocking effects .",
    "relaxation due to bosonic excitations has a strong impact on both current and shot noise in this region , for example , the shot noise behaves non - monotonically as a function of the coupling strength to the bosonic bath .",
    "the fano factor ( noise to current ratio ) can become arbitrarily large in the blocking regime . in another special set of couplings the fano factor",
    "can be reduced to 1/3 , resembling that of a one - dimensional wire .",
