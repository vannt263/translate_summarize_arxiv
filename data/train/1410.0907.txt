    "nonlinear optics has lead the way of several fundamental discoveries , elegant and fascinating one of these is the optical solitons .",
    "these solitons are extensively studied since last three decades not only because of their mathematical elegance but also due to applications in photonics and optical communications  @xcite .",
    "optical beams and pulses spread during propagation due to self - diffraction or dispersion .",
    "this broadening can be arrested in optical nonlinear media resulting in stable optical beams or pulses whose spreading is exactly balanced by optical nonlinearity and these self trapped beams or pulses are known as optical solitons  @xcite .",
    "optical spatial solitons are self - trapped optical beams whose spreading due to diffraction is exactly balanced by optical nonlinearity induced self lensing mechanisms.the optical beam induces a refractive index change in the medium thereby creating an optical waveguide which subsequently guides the beam .",
    "thus , the beam first creates an waveguide and then self - trapped and guided in the waveguide created by itself .",
    "an optical temporal soliton on the otherhand is a nonspreading optical pulse whose broadening due to group velocity dispersion is exactly balanced by the nonlinearity induced self phase modulation .",
    "more explicitly , the group velocity dispersion produces a chirp in the propagating pulse which is balanced by the opposite chirp created by nonlinearity .",
    "exact balance of these opposite chirps results in the formation of optical temporal solitons .",
    "way back in 1995 , zabusky and kruskal  @xcite introduced the term solitons to reflect the particle like properties of stable self - trapped waves in nonlinear media .",
    "the motivation behind this was the fact that the shape of these self - trapped wavepackets remain intact even after collision .",
    "historically , this term was reserved for those wavepackets which obey integrable partial differential equations that can be solved by inverse scattering theory  @xcite .",
    "solitons , which are solutions of these equations , remain invariant even after collision since they undergo elastic collision . optical beam and pulse propagation in kerr",
    "nonlinear media are governed by partial differential equations which are integrable via inverse scattering technique , hence , optical solitons can be created in such media . however , most physical optical systems , for example photorefractive media , possess non - kerr types of nonlinearity in which optical beams or pulses are described by dynamical equations that are though partial differential equations but not integrable by inverse scattering technique .",
    "self - trapped solutions of these non - integrable equations are known as solitary waves. these solitary waves are not solitons since collision between these solitary waves is not always elastic  @xcite . for example , under specific conditions , two photorefractive optical spatial solitary waves may coalesce to form a single solitary wave and a single solitary wave might undergo fission to give birth to new solitons . however , these solitary waves in many cases play extremely important role in several applications . in literature , despite their shortcoming , it is now quite common to loosely refer all self - trapped optical solitary waves as solitons regardless of whether they obey integrable partial differential equation or not .      guiding of optical beams in the self created waveguide was first pointed out by askaryan in 1962  @xcite .",
    "kelly  @xcite pointed out that in kerr nonlinear media spatial solitons with two transverse dimensions(2d ) are unstable and undergo catastrophic collapse .",
    "soon it was realised that spatial solitons with only one transverse dimensions(1d ) are stable in kerr nonlinear media  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , it was also realized that catastrophic collapse of 2d solitons could be avoided in an optical media possessing saturating nonlinearity  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the idea of saturating nonlinearity was the key to the discovery of a plethora of optical spatial solitons .",
    "inspite of the prediction of formation of stable 2d solitons in saturating nonlinear media , no progress was made in creating these solitons due to lack of identification of appropriate optical materials that possess saturating nonlinearity .",
    "the breakthrough was made by segev et al  @xcite in 1990 with the identification of non - kerr type of nonlinearity in photorefractive media and observation of optical spatial solitons due to such nonlinearities . unlike kerr solitons , the dynamics of photorefractive solitons , under a variety of photorefractive nonlinear effects ,",
    "is governed by modified nonlinear schr@xmath0dinger equations .",
    "photorefractive nonlinearity is non - instantaneous , typically nonlocal and inherently saturable and spatial solitons in these media can be created at microwatt power level using very simple set up in the laboratory , while their formation time ranges from microseconds to minutes .",
    "+   + photorefractive optical spatial solitons possess several unique properties , for example unlike kerr solitons which undergo elastic collision , collisions of these solitons are inelastic , more diverse and interesting .",
    "the inelastic collision between two photorefractive spatial solitons may lead to soliton fusion or fission , with particle - like annihilation or birth of new solitons .",
    "another unique feature is that one can create an induced waveguide using a weak soliton beam which subsequently can be used to guide another powerful beam at different wavelength at which the material is less photosensitive  @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that photorefractive spatial soliton - induced waveguides can be used for device applications such as directional couplers and high efficiency frequency converters  @xcite .",
    "these unique features of photorefractive nonlinearity have opened up immense possibilities for new and novel devices , such as all optical switching and routing , steering , interconnects , parallel computing , optical storage etc  @xcite .",
    "they are also promising for experimental verification of theoretical models , since , they can be created at very low power . in the present article ,",
    "we confine our discussion on the properties of photorefractive optical spatial solitons .",
    "this review is only partial description of the development of photorefractive optical spatial solitons , interested readers are referred to several excellent recent reviews  @xcite .",
    "exposure of a photorefractive ( pr ) material with optical field of nonuniform intensity leads to the excitation of charge carriers of inhomogeneous density .",
    "these charge carriers then migrate due to drift or diffusion or both and creates space charge field which subsequently modifies the refractive index of the material via either linear electro - optic or quadratic electro - optic effect  @xcite .",
    "change in the refractive index of certain electro - optic materials due to optically induced redistribution of charge carriers is known as photorefractive(pr ) effect .",
    "photorefractive effect has potential applications in holography  @xcite , optical phase conjugation  @xcite , optical signal processing and optical storage  @xcite . generally , pr materials are classified in three different categories .",
    "most commonly used pr materials are inorganic ferroelectrics , such as @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 etc .",
    "recently , large number of experiments on spatial solitons have been performed  @xcite in centrosymmetric paraelectric potassium lithium tantalate niobate @xmath4 .",
    "some selected semiconductors such as inp , gaas , cdte etc . , also show pr property with large carrier mobility that produces fast dielectric response time , which is important for fast image processing .",
    "they have potential use in fast holographic processing of optical information .",
    "the third category pr materials are polymers which shows strong pr effect  @xcite at high applied voltage . pr pattern can be erased easily in polymers by decreasing applied voltage .",
    "the band transport model of kukhtarev - vinetskii  @xcite has been widely used to describe the theoretical foundation of pr nonlinearity . in view of this model",
    ", we assume a pr medium with completely full valance band and an empty conduction band which is illuminated by an optical field of nonuniforn intensity .",
    "it has both donor and acceptor centers , uniformly distributed , whose energy states lies somewhere in the middle of the band gap .",
    "the donor electron states are at higher energy in comparison to that of acceptor energy states .",
    "the nonuniform optical field excites unionized donors and creates charge carriers .",
    "these charge carriers move to the conduction band where they are free to move , to diffuse or to drift under the combined influence of self generated and external electric field and are finally trapped by the acceptors . during this process ,",
    "some of the electrons are captured by ionized donors and thus are neutralized , and finally a steady state is reached with the creation of internal space charge field , that can be evaluated using donor ionization rate equation , electron continuity equation , current density @xmath5 equation , poisson s equation and the charge density(@xmath6 ) equation  @xcite which are as follows : @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are densities of electron , donor , acceptor , and ionized donor , respectively ; @xmath16 is the photoexcitation cross section , @xmath17 is the intensity of light in terms of poynting flux , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are rate of thermal generation and electron trap recombination coefficient , respectively .",

    "the current density arises due to the drift , diffusion and photovoltaic effect ; @xmath26 is the sum of externally applied field and the generated space charge field @xmath27 .",
    "most experimental investigations on pr solitons have been performed using one dimensional waves , therefore , it is appropriate to find material response in one transverse dimension ( say x only ) . in the steady state equations ( 1)-(4 )",
    "reduces to : @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the dark irradiance which is also the homogeneous intensity that controls the conductivity of the crystal .",
    "usually @xmath17 is such that @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the space charge field @xmath27 under these approximations turns out to be @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the external bias field to the crystal and photovoltaic field , respectively . in the above derivation",
    "we have assumed that the power density of the optical field and space charge field attain asymptotically constant values i.e. , @xmath39 and @xmath40 . the refractive index change @xmath41 in a noncentrosymmetric pr crystal  @xcite , such as @xmath3 , @xmath1 etc .",
    ", is due to the linear electro - optic effect ( pockel s ) and is given by @xmath42 @xmath43,\\ ] ] where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are effective linear electro - optic coefficient and average refractive index , respectively .",
    "in centrosymmetric pr materials the index change is due to the quadratic electro - optic response to a photoinduced internal field and can be expressed  @xcite as @xmath46 @xmath47^{2},\\ ] ] where @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the effective quadratic electro - optic coefficient , relative dielectric constant , free space permittivity and refractive index of the crystal , respectively ; it is assumed that the ( dc ) polarization is in the linear regime .",
    "depending on the sign of @xmath48 the nonlinearity is either self - focusing or defocusing .",
    "the nonlinear property of the pr media is evident from equations(12 ) and ( 14 ) since the refractive index is intensity dependent .",
    "different terms in the above expressions are responsible for the existence of different types of solitons .",
    "screening and photovoltaic solitons respectively owe their existence to the first and second term in these expressions .",
    "when both first and second terms are dominant , one would expect screening photovoltaic solitons .",
    "the third term in each of these equations arises due to the diffusion process and is not in general responsible for the formation of solitons , however , it is responsible for self deflection of solitons  @xcite .",
    "way back in 1992 , segev et al  @xcite first detected pr solitons in quasi steady - state regime .",
    "soon pr screening solitons were predicted and identified  @xcite .",
    "two different varieties of steady state screening solitons were subsequently investigated and identified in different biased noncentrosymmetric media under varieties of experimental configurations  @xcite .",

    "these solitons , popularly known as photovoltaic solitons , have been observed experimentally in 1d as well as 2d configurations  @xcite . besides these , pr solitons which are combination of the screening and photovoltaic solitons",
    "were also predicted and successfully observed  @xcite .",
    "they owe their existence to both photovoltaic effect and spatially nonuniform screening of the applied field , and , are also known as screening photovoltaic ( sp ) solitons . by controlling the magnitude of bias field",
    "they can be converted to screening solitons or photovoltaic solitons .",
    "+   + pr crystals like @xmath1 possess high second - order susceptibility , hence , can be used for parametric processes such as second - harmonic generation .",
    "recently , it has become very popular , primarily due to its ultra slow pr relaxation time owing to which any written solitonic channels can act as optical waveguides for long time even after turning off the soliton beam .",
    "these soliton induced waveguides have been used both for switching devices  @xcite and enhancing the second harmonic conversion efficiency  @xcite .",
    "though non - centrosymmetric pr crystals possess large nonlinearity , their typical response time is in the range of milliseconds , hence , these materials are not suitable for very fast reconfigurable waveguide channels and switches . on the otherhand using paraelectric centrosymmetric pr crystals , particularly kltn , delre et al",
    ".  @xcite demonstrated dynamic switching using electroholography  @xcite .",
    "spatial solitons are created in paraelectrics that in turn is employed to guide the signal beam of non - photorefractive wavelength .",

    "fast electro - optic response of @xmath52 makes them useful in important applications like optical communications and signal processing and this has paved the way to fast nanosecond applications of pr spatial solitons  @xcite .",

    ", we consider an optical beam with large transverse spatial dimension . since we are confining our present interest on the stability of a broad bright beam of finite transverse extension , therefore @xmath183 and hence , @xmath184 .",
    "therefore , the evolution equation of the broad optical field reduces to @xmath185 equation ( 36 ) admits a steady state cw solution @xmath186,$ ] where @xmath187 is the initial input power at @xmath188 and @xmath189 is the nonlinear phase shift which increases with propagation distance @xmath120 according to @xmath190 the initial stage of mi can be investigated in the linear stability framework , under which the stability of the steady state solution is examined by introducing a perturbation in the amplitude of the beam envelope so that the perturbed field now becomes : @xmath191\\exp[i\\psi(\\xi ) ] , % \\end{equation}\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath192 is an arbitrarily small complex perturbation field such that @xmath193 .",
    "substituting the perturbed field in equation ( 36 ) and retaining terms linear only in the perturbed quantity , the evolution equation for the perturbation field is obtained as @xmath194 where @xmath195 denotes complex conjugate .",
    "the spatial perturbation @xmath192 is assumed to be composed of two sideband plane waves @xmath196 where @xmath197 and @xmath198 are the real amplitudes of the perturbing field , @xmath199 and @xmath200 being the wave number and spatial frequency of the perturbations , respectively .",
    "substitution for the perturbation field into its evolution equation yields : @xmath201 where @xmath202 and @xmath203 .",
    "equation(40 ) possesses a nontrivial solution only when the following dispersion relation holds good : @xmath204 if the wave number of the perturbation becomes complex , then the instability will set in with exponential growth of the perturbation field @xmath192 resulting in the filamentation of the broad beam into a number of filaments .",
    "thus , the propagating broad optical beam will be unstable .",
    "the growth rate @xmath205 of the mi is obtained as @xmath206      mi gain is achievable in a photovoltaic pr ( pvpr ) crystal for a given range of frequency and specified range of values of @xmath207 and @xmath187 .",
    "parameters @xmath208 and @xmath209 are always positive , while @xmath75 and @xmath73 can be both positive or negative depending on the media and the polarity of the external bias field . in an unbiased pvpr media @xmath210 , thus k is always positive if @xmath211 . hence , usually in such media , modulation instability can not set in",
    ". however , in such media with the application of external field of appropriate magnitude and polarity mi can set in and grow as long as    @xmath212    therefore , with the application of external electric field , it is possible to initiate modulation instability and control the growth of the instability in those media where mi was hitherto prohibited . on the other hand ,",
    "if for a given value of beam power mi growth rate is finite in an unbiased pvpr medium with positive value of @xmath75 , then the instability growth rate can be enhanced or decreased with the application of external electric field of appropriate magnitude and polarity . or in other words , growth rate of the instability can be controlled with the application of external field of chosen polarity and magnitude .",
    "mi can takes place only below the critical frequency @xmath213 which is given by @xmath214^{1/2}.\\ ] ] the instability is most efficient and reaches its maximum at @xmath215 when @xmath216 , where @xmath217 and @xmath218 . to examine the mi growth , we take a typical cu : knsbn crystal . intermediate energy level is included in cu : knsbn crystal and photovoltaic field is in the direction of optic axis . at @xmath219 ,",
    "crystal parameters are @xmath220 , @xmath221 , @xmath222 .",
    "the scaling parameter @xmath223 , @xmath224 and @xmath166 .",
    "we take three different values of @xmath225 , in particular , @xmath226 , @xmath227 and @xmath228 which corresponds to @xmath229 and @xmath230 respectively .",
    "figure ( 1 ) depicts the mi gain spectrum @xmath231 as a function of perturbation frequency @xmath200 .",
    "the variation of @xmath232 with @xmath187 for three values of @xmath73 has been depicted in figure ( 2 ) .",
    "initially @xmath232 increases with the increase in the value of @xmath187 then decreases with the increase in @xmath187 . in order to examine the role played by @xmath75 on the growth of the instability , we have demonstrated in figure ( 3 ) the variation of maximum growth @xmath233 with the normalized beam power for three different value of @xmath75 . as expected ,",
    "a higher value of @xmath75 enhances the growth of the instability . in conclusion , with the application of external electric field , it is possible to initiate modulation instability and control the growth of the instability in those media where mi was hitherto prohibited .",
