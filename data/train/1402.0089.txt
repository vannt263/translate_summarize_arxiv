    "although there is as yet no certain observational evidence for the existence of gravitomagnetic mass or dual ( or magnetic ) mass or gravitomagnetic monopole , the investigation of the geodesic properties of kntn space - time has great significance from theoretical and conceptual points of view .",
    "the dual mass has also an intrinsic properties of the space - time in gravitational physics .",
    "the possibilities of the observational search for the gravito - magnetic monopole was first proposed by lynden - bell and nouri - zonoz@xcite in 1998 .",
    "it has been also suggested that signatures of such spacetimes might be found in the spectra of supernovae , quasars , or active galactic nuclei . in @xcite",
    "the authors pointed out that zero charge kntn bh possesses thin accretion disk which is of astrophysically has an importance because they could be used as models for certain galaxies , superposition of a black holes and a galaxy or an accretion disk as in the case of quasars .",
    "it is well known that most astro - physical compact objects possess only a small net charge or no charge at all@xcite .",
    "therefore from the astrophysical perspectives , the importance of such studies have very limited applications .",
    "for instance , kibble in 1980 suggested that gravitomagnetic monopoles would be a natural consequence of the big bang@xcite . in case of taub - nut space - time ,",
    "the presence of the nut parameter i.e. gravitomagnetic monopole produced the lensing pattern and all the geodesics including the null geodesics are lie on a cone@xcite .",
    "it has been also observed there that there is an extra shear due to the presence of the gravitomagnetic field of nut space , which shears the shape of the source . since the tn space - time possesses gravitomagnetic monopole that affect the structure of the accretion disk and might offer novel observational prospects@xcite . when we added the charge parameter with ktn black hole and the study of circular geodesic motion of a neutral test particle in this gravitational field has a significance purely from the theoretical point of view .",
    "in einstein s general relativity , circular geodesics of arbitrary radii are not possible , there exists a minimum radius below which no circular orbits are possible .",
    "the conditions for the existence of innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) , marginally bound circular orbit(mbco ) and circular photon orbits ( cpo ) have been considered for the schwarzschild black hole @xcite , reissner nordstrm(rn ) black - hole @xcite , kerr black hole @xcite , kerr - newman(kn ) black hole @xcite and kerr - taub - nut(ktn ) black hole more recently @xcite .    but",
    "the properties of equatorial circular geodesic of kntn space - times have not been considered in the extant literature .",
    "thus in this work , we wish to study the complete geodesic structure of a neutral test particle in the kntn geometry .",
    "this is one way to study the gravitational field around the black hole in the presence of both charge and nut parameter .",
    "we also investigate the conditions for the existence of isco , mbco and cpo of kntn black hole .",
    "we also calculate the important astronomical quantities like kepler frequency @xmath0 , angular momentum @xmath1 , energy @xmath2 , rotational velocity @xmath3 which is an important tool to study the accretion process in the black hole .",
    "we further demonstrate that the penrose process which had not been investigated previously for the said black hole in the presence of both charge ( @xmath4 ) and nut parameter ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "basically the kntn space - time is an analytic solution of the vacuum einstein - maxwell equations and due to presence of the nut charge which makes the space - time to be asymptotically non - flat , in contrast with kn black hole . when the metric is expressed in boyer - lindquist type",
    "coordinates , two types of coordinate singularity are manifested .",
    "one occurs at certain values of the radial coordinate where @xmath6 becomes infinite and corresponds to bifurcate killing horizons ; the other occurs at @xmath7 , where the determinant of the components of the metric vanishes .",
    "the fact that the delineation of the geodesics exhibits the essential features of the space - time .",
    "therefore a detailed analysis of the circular geodesics particularly isco , mbco and cpo are of great significance . due to the inclusion of both nut and charge parameter",
    "what effects are manifested in the geodetic precession and the dragging of inertial frames ( lense - thirring effect ) @xcite , this investigation is also crucial and might have a link to the studies of the equatorial causal geodesics .",
    "circular geodesic motion in the equatorial plane ( @xmath8 ) is of fundamental importance in black hole accretion disk theory also @xcite .",
    "thus isco , mbco and cpo are more relevant in this regard .",
    "keplerian circular orbits exist in the region @xmath9 , with @xmath10 being the circular photon orbit .",
    "bound orbit exists in the region @xmath11 , with @xmath12 being the marginally bound circular orbit , and stable orbit exist in the region @xmath13 , with @xmath14 being the innermost stable circular orbit ( also called marginally stable circular orbit ) .",
    "the location of these radii are calculated in the subsequent section .",
