    "multiferroics have attracted great attention recently because of their promising new functionality and intriguing fundamental science .",
    "a multiferroic material with a large ferroic polarization , high ordering temperature , and strong coupling between the ferroic orders is ideal for applications .",
    "so far , those desired properties have not been realized in a single phase material .",
    "multiferroics like bifeo@xmath2 where the magnetic and electric orders originate from different part of the structure have high ordering temperatures but weak coupling between different orders.@xcite other materials like tbmn@xmath0o@xmath3 exhibiting ferroelectricity due to the broken symmetry caused by the spiral magnetic moment have strong magneto - electric coupling.@xcite however , here the ordering temperature is very low and the electric polarization is small .",
    "lufe@xmath0o@xmath1 contains layers of fe@xmath0o@xmath0 with a triangular lattice that are sandwiched by luo@xmath0 layers .",
    "combined with the mixed valance of fe , the fe@xmath0o@xmath0 layers in the triangular lattice form a charge ordered state at @xmath4=320 k , followed by a ferrimagnetic order at @xmath5=240 k.@xcite significant changes in dielectric properties have been observed upon application of a small magnetic field at room temperature.@xcite the relatively high transition temperature , large polarization , high magnetic coercivity and the strong magneto - electric coupling make lufe@xmath0o@xmath1 a unique multiferroic material .",
    "recently , the possibility of fast switching and high tunability of lufe@xmath0o@xmath1 due to the electronic origin of its charge order was demonstrated.@xcite    compared to the large amount of effort to study bulk lufe@xmath0o@xmath1 , there are only a couple of reported attempts to grow lufe@xmath0o@xmath1 thin films on @xmath6-al@xmath0o@xmath2 ( 001 ) and on si substrates using pulsed laser deposition ( pld).@xcite liu et al found that the growth of lufe@xmath0o@xmath1 on @xmath6-al@xmath0o@xmath2 ( 001 ) ( with a target consisting of a sintered mixture of lu@xmath0o@xmath2 and fe@xmath0o@xmath2 ) needs substrate temperatures as high as 850 @xmath7c.@xcite in addition , a significant deviation of the lu : fe stoichiometry from 1:2 was observed , which was attributed to different ablation efficiencies of lu and fe in the target .",
    "this problem was circumvented by enriching the fe concentration of the target material . however , as a result , fe@xmath2o@xmath1 and fe@xmath0o@xmath2 impurities were introduced as intermediate layers between the lufe@xmath0o@xmath1 film and the @xmath6-al@xmath0o@xmath2 substrate .    in this paper , we present a comprehensive study on the growth of lu - fe - o compound thin films on mgo ( 111 ) substrates using pulsed laser deposition ( pld ) .",
    "the experimentally constructed growth diagram shows that the parameter space for growing epitaxial lufe@xmath0o@xmath1 thin films turns out to be a narrow window of temperature and o@xmath0 pressure , which creates significant experimental difficulty .",
    "based on these results we have gained fundamental understanding of the growth of lu - fe - o compound films : the growth temperature needs to be high enough to stabilize the lufe@xmath0o@xmath1 phase ; on the other hand the loss of fe at high temperature also produces phases other than lufe@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "these two effects cause narrow window of the growth condition producing lufe@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "typical lufe@xmath0o@xmath1 films appear to be superparamagnetic , which is consistent with the fact that the lufe@xmath0o@xmath1 in the film is epitaxially sandwiched by an impurity phase of hexagonal lufeo@xmath2 ( h - lufeo@xmath2 ) .",
    "the current demonstration of epitaxial growth of lufe@xmath0o@xmath1 thin films opens up new possibilities for studying multiferroicity of low dimensional lufe@xmath0o@xmath1 , tuning of its properties , and eventual functionalization .",
    "the paper is organized as the following : section ii describes the experimental conditions used in this work ; section iii presents the experimental results including the growth diagram , structural characterizations and magnetism ; explanations of the observed growth diagram and magnetism of the films are proposed in section iv .",
    "lu - fe - o compound thin films were grown using pld with a krf ( @xmath8=248 nm ) laser .",
    "the energy density of the laser is 2.5 j @xmath9 with a repetition rate of 1 hz . the target - substrate distance was 3.5 cm .",
    "the thickness of the films grown in this study is approximately 100 nm .",
    "the substrates are mgo ( 111 ) single crystals annealed in o@xmath0 for 24 hours at 1100 @xmath7c .",
    "the target material used is polycrystalline lufe@xmath0o@xmath1 , whose properties are verified using powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) and a superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) .",
    "after growth , the sample heating is turned off so that the sample cools to below 200 @xmath7c at the same pressure as that of the growth condition within 5 minutes .",
    "the substrates were clamped on a heater with a pt foil in between .",
    "the sample temperature was measured by a pyrometer using emissivity of 0.3 . in principle , all the parameters described above will have to be scanned and optimized in order to realize the growth of high quality lufe@xmath0o@xmath1 thin films . in this work , we are more focused on elucidating the mechanism of the growth . therefore , fine scans of the substrate temperature and the o@xmath0 pressure were carried out to map out the growth diagram involving the growth of more than one hundred samples , while all the other parameters were kept constant .",

    "here we propose an explanation in terms of competition between nucleation and desorption of adatoms and its dependence on temperature and supersaturation .",
    "the residence time @xmath21 of an adsorbed atom is given by :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the vibrational frequency and @xmath24 is the desorption energy . clearly , the residence time of an adatom is shorter at high temperature due to the higher desorption rate .",
    "the observed loss of fe atoms suggests a smaller desorption energy ( higher desorption rate ) for fe atoms . at low temperature , because @xmath25 is large for both lu and fe adatoms , the lu : fe stoichiometry can be close to that of the target .    the nucleation speed of deposited adatoms is :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the effective supersaturation ( molar bulk gibbs free energy change with surface energy consideration ) , while @xmath28 is proportional to the square of the edge energy of the nuclei per unit length.@xcite therefore , at the high temperature limit , the nucleation speed decreases with temperature and a high supersaturation favors a high nucleation speed .",

    "these assumptions appear to be valid because the thermo - chemical parameters extracted from the model quantitatively agree with those from the literature .",
    "in other words , the growth of lu - fe - o at 1050 @xmath7c can be described using equilibrium thermodynamics , presumably due to the thermodynamic equilibration that occurs in between the laser pulses . here",
    "the competition between the desorption and nucleation determines the lu : fe stoichiometry .",
    "when the temperature is high enough , the time scales of the nucleation and desorption are comparable . in this case ,",

    ", this is indeed what has been observed in our experiments .",
    "the observation of superparamagnetism in the lufe@xmath0o@xmath1 films is unusual considering the bulk magnetic properties of lufe@xmath0o@xmath1 : an easy axis along the [ 001 ] direction with anisotropy energy as large as 100 k / spin and gigantic coercivity ( 9 t at 4 k).@xcite these unique bulk properties were attributed to the significant contribution of orbital magnetic moments ( 0.8 @xmath40/f.u . )",

    "@xcite the following scenario may explain the reduction of coercivity qualitatively : the structure of lufe@xmath0o@xmath1 and h - lufeo@xmath2 both consist of layers of triangular lattice that can be epitaxial to each other nicely .",

    "@xcite from xrd data , one can see the co - existence of both lufe@xmath0o@xmath1 and h - lufeo@xmath2 phases .",
    "hrtem indicates that the lufe@xmath0o@xmath1 layers are divided into clusters ( much smaller than the magnetic domain size in bulk ) by the h - lufeo@xmath2 layers and defects .",
    "according to a recent study , h - lufeo@xmath2 is weakly ferromagnetic , i.e. much less magnetic than lufe@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite therefore , when these lufe@xmath0o@xmath1 clusters are much smaller than the dimensions of the magnetic domain in the bulk , one expects to see a reduction in coercivity . on the other hand , given the large anisotropy energy 100 k / spin , the observed hysteresis is too small even for clusters having a size as small as a few nanometers .",
    "further study on the microscopic magnetic structure is needed to understand the difference between the bulk and films .",
    "in conclusion , we studied the growth dynamics of lufe@xmath0o@xmath1 films on mgo ( 111 ) substrates and constructed the growth diagram . according to our understanding , application of the correct thermochemistry",
