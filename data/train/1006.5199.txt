    "the theoretical analysis of toroidal ordering in electric [ ] and magnetic [ ] systems has recently been investigated .",

    "here we address the possibility of defining a toroidal order parameter for a system in which it is the _ primary _ magnetic order parameter .",
    "the major problem is to identify a situation in which there is ferrotoroidicity but there is no nonzero fourier component of average spin . in this paper",
    "we consider a two dimensional system of toroidal spin plaquettes , such as those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , which exhibits the desired behavior .",
    "toroidal plaquettes with 2 , 3 , or 4 moments.,width=8 ]",
    "we consider a system of microscopic circular discs ( confined to lie in the @xmath4-@xmath5 plane ) which contain three spins in a triangular configuration as in the center panel of fig .",
    "each spin has a large single ion anisotropy so that it is aligned either parallel or antiparallel to its local axis fixed in the plane of the disc , as shown in fig .",
    "the intraplaquette dipolar interactions are strong enough so that at temperatures of interest the spins in each plaquette come to thermal equilibrium in one of the two degenerate ground states as shown in fig .",
    "the magnetic dipole moment of each spin is mimicked by a pair of opposite charges ( @xmath6 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . if @xmath7 is the distance of the charges from the center of the plaquette , then the magnitude of the dipole moment is @xmath8 .",
    "the orientation of the disc is defined by the angle @xmath9 between the @xmath4-direction and the dashed line fixed on the plaquette .     a plaquette with three spins in one of their dipolar ground states .",
    "each magnetic dipole is represented by a pair of charges @xmath6 whose positions are fixed by the angle @xmath10.,width=8 ]    we now calculate the interaction energy @xmath11 of plaquette a whose center is at the origin and plaquette b whose center is at @xmath12 . to calculate @xmath11 we invoke the multipole expansion of the electrostatic energy ( which is proportional to the desired magnetic dipole - dipole energy ) between the charges on the two plaquettes .",
    "this energy is a sum over terms of the form @xmath13 , where @xmath14 .",
    "the positions are functions of @xmath15 and the symmetry of the plaquette indicates that the result can only involve factors of @xmath16 .",
    "also this term must be odd in both @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "accordingly , the lowest order nonzero term is of order @xmath19 .",
    "so at this order @xmath20 where @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) is the amplitude of the charges on plaquette a ( b ) .",
    "we only need this for small @xmath10 , so @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the @xmath1th magnetic moment . for the present situation it seems reasonable to define the toroidicity @xmath0 of the @xmath1th plaquette such that @xmath25 so that @xmath26 note that this definition , unlike the standard one , [ ] has the property that the magnetostatic interaction energy between two toroids is proportional to product of their toroidal ` strengths ' @xmath0 . to get",
    "@xmath27 we may consider the lowest order terms in the expansion of @xmath11 in powers of @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",

    "each plaquette is characterized by its center of mass position @xmath29 inside a two dimensional box in the @xmath4-@xmath5 plane with respect to which the plaquette has mirror symmetry .",
    "the @xmath1th plaquette can assume an orientation specified by @xmath30 and has a toroidal strength @xmath0 which is an ising - like variable : @xmath31 , according to which of the two ground states the spins occupy .",
    "we assume an orientationally independent interaction between plaquettes which for concreteness we take to be the lennard - jones potential , @xmath32^{12 } - \\left [ \\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\right]^{6 } \\biggr ) \\ , \\label{lj } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are constants .",
    "[ ] because the system is two dimensional , the plaquettes can not develop long range order characteristic of a three dimensional solid .",
    "[ ] instead the system can develop various behaviors intermediate between a conventional solid and an isotropic liquid .",
    "as shown in ref .",
    "the system exhibits a ` solid ' phase in which bond - orientational order is truly long range but position correlations exhibit power - law decay .",
    "the ` solid ' melts either directly or indirectly ( via a hexatic phase ) into an isotropic liquid phase .",
    "here we focus on the transition as the temperature is lowered through the value @xmath35 at which the ` solid ' phase appears and assume that @xmath36 is much larger than the magnetic interactions between plaquettes . even in the ` solid ' phase",
    ", there is no true long range positional order .",
    "then the spin correlation function will involve an average over correlations between a spin at the origin and spins in a distant plaquette .",
    "since the average spin in a plaquette is zero , the spin correlation function , like the positional correlation function , can not display long range order .",
    "in contrast , because there is long - range bond orientational order , lowering the temperature can lead to phase transitions due to the interplaquette dipolar interactions .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to analyze the symmetry of the resulting ordered phases . in a likely scenario",
    "we find that the ` solid ' undergoes two such phase transitions . at the first ( higher temperature ) transition we find that time reversal symmetry is broken and at the second spatial inversion symmetry is also broken . since the underlying system does not have long - range positional ordering ,",
    "the spin correlation function itself is never long ranged . to substantiate this picture",
    "it is necessary to analyze the interplaquette interactions and thereby verify that they lead to ising - like transitions .",
    "to calculate the interaction between two plaquettes , each of which is confined to the @xmath4-@xmath5 plane , we assume ( see fig .",

    "we drop the last term in @xmath46 since it can not contribute to a term involving @xmath47 .",

    "thus @xmath54 where @xmath55    we now analyze how @xmath11 depends on @xmath56 , i. e. how it depends on @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "note that @xmath57 and @xmath58 each carry a factor of @xmath48 .",
    "however , factors that do not depend on @xmath58 and @xmath57 carry factors of @xmath59 or @xmath60 , so that can be no terms at order @xmath61 which are cubic in @xmath58 or @xmath57 .",
    "therefore @xmath11 can only depend on @xmath56 through the argument @xmath62 .",
    "in addition , for @xmath11 to be invariant under a global rotation , it can only depend on differences in angle .",
    "also the result can only be a function of @xmath63 and @xmath64 because it must be invariant under @xmath65 .",
    "thus @xmath66 must be of the form @xmath67 one can view the system looking either along the positive @xmath48 axis or along the negative @xmath48 axis . comparing these two views , one sees that a positive rotation is equivalent to changing the sign of the charges followed by a negative rotation .",
    "but the interaction energy is invariant under charge conjugation .",
    "so @xmath68 furthermore , consider what happens if we average the interaction over the orientation @xmath30 of one of the plaquettes .",
    "this superposition of charges leads to a uniformly charge - neutral plaquette .",

    "the interactions so far postulated , the hamiltonian is invariant under the local transformation @xmath75 this is a nontrivial symmetry that indicates that the two configurations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] have the same energy at leading order in the multipole expansion .",
    "note that changing the sign of @xmath76 is equivalent to changing the sign of the toroidal moment @xmath0 . as a result of this local gauge symmetry it follows from elitzur s theorem",

    "these two configurations have the same interaction energy truncated at order @xmath84 .",

    "these assumed interactions do not depend on the orientation of either of the interacting plaquettes .",
    "( with this assumption elitzur s theorem applies . )",

    "as one further reduces the temperature , the interplaquette dipolar interactions come into play and can cause order to develop consistent with the local gauge symmetry",

    "accordingly , we can define @xmath56 as being measured relative to the direction between the central plaquette and one of its neighbors .",
    "so we may take @xmath86 to be an integer for all nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "we do not consider further neighbor interactions in view of how rapidly the interplaquette interaction falls off with separation .",
