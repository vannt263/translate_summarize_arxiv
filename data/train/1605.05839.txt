    "transparent conductive oxides ( tcos ) are very promising materials for opto - electronics , due to their wide band gap @xcite , transparency to visible light , and good n - type conductivity @xcite .",

    "electron energy loss spectroscopy ( eels ) is a powerful technique in this respect . in the transmission electron microscope ( tem )",
    "core electrons can be excited when probe electrons are inelastically scattered in their proximity , giving rise to energy losses at the ionization edge . in this way , through the so - called energy loss near - edge fine structure ( elnes ) , fingerprints of chemical environment and electronic structure of excited atoms can be detected .",
    "scanning transmission electron microscopy ( stem ) eels allows for the investigation of the electronic structure of selected crystal regions , namely columns of atoms , by scanning over the sample @xcite . in comparison to stem , illuminating the specimen by a wide beam in the tem mode offers a lower risk to manipulate or damage the sample by a too high dose of impinging electrons , and does not require an aberration corrector for the condenser optics of the microscope .",
    "to selectively probe specific crystal regions or planes in the tem mode measurements can be performed in diffraction mode , by means of the energy loss by channeled electrons ( elce ) technique @xcite .",
    "aligning the crystal in a systematic row condition with respect to the incident beam establishes standing waves with maxima of the electron intensity at a well - defined set of crystal planes . in this case",
    ", the elnes signal becomes highly sensitive to energy losses in different regions of the unit cell upon small variations of the diffraction conditions @xcite , or of the momentum transfer of the detected signal @xcite .",
    "elnes fingerprints of o 1@xmath2 electrons are of special importance , since they differ between pure @xmath1- crystals and other group - iii sesquioxides , such as , and their ternary compounds , such as @xmath4 .",
    "polarization - dependent core spectroscopy represents another technique to investigate local electronic structures beyond the use of electrons .",
    "while in x - ray absorption spectroscopy the polarization of the illumination can be utilized as an additional degree of freedom for obtaining more detailed structural insight @xcite , this is not possible with high - energy electrons .",
    "however , the strong elastic scattering cross section of electrons in the matter allows for orientation - sensitive electron channeling , which is the basis for the elce approach , to be employed as an additional channel of structural information .",
    "a thorough interpretation and understanding of elnes and elce features requires insight from theory .",
