    "[ sec_introduction ]    the relativistic two body problem and the properties of bound states in relativistic quantum mechanics have a very long history and a really large number of solutions have been devised .",
    "some of these proposals stress the properties of covariance of the model , others assume as a starting point the constraint dynamics or arise directly from a classical symplectic context , others determine effective interactions from field theory in order to get results to be compared with phenomenological data .",
    "the bound state spectra are considered with particular interest , being rather difficult to treat in a pure quantum field theory framework .",
    "a historical overview of the subject can be found in @xcite .",
    "the research , however , has actively continued up to present days and several papers keep being published both on the mathematical and the phenomenological aspects of the problem ( see e.g. @xcite-@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "some years ago the present authors too gave a contribution to this discussion , proposing a lorentz invariant classical model for the two body coulomb and gravitational interactions where the relativistic covariance is nonlinearly realized @xcite .",
    "the paper was written in a plain coordinate language but it was rather strongly influenced by geometrical and symplectic ideas .",
    "these were developed elsewhere from a mathematical viewpoint and in a more general context , using group theoretical ideas for the treatment of classical spinning particles , @xcite , or studying rigorously the mathematics of skew - commutative phase spaces , @xcite .",
    "we could however observe that a peculiar property of the coordinate system determined in @xcite  and briefly recalled in the following section 2 for the sake of completeness  is that the relative time coordinate disappears from the dynamics , and a symplectic reduction of the phase space is made possible , @xcite : the relative time plays the role of a gauge and therefore it can be given an arbitrary form .",
    "the procedure permits then , if needed , to reconstruct the two separate world - lines in the minkowski space , whose structure and correlation are obviously dependent upon the chosen form of the relative time gauge function .",
    "the present paper makes a revisitation of our previous model and deals with its canonical quantization , assuming that the interacting particles are fermions with arbitrary masses .",
    "we therefore develop our arguments and we find the wave equation for the two fermion system in a framework of pure relativistic quantum mechanics , without any reference to second quantization techniques : this is , probably , the simplest way to transfer the classical results to the quantum context and to obtain a complete control of the symmetry and covariance properties of the theory .",
    "the wave equation is determined in the presence of a general scalar potential , but the explicit results are focused on the coulomb interaction , with the purpose of calculating the spectrum of the lowest bound states and in particular of determining the dependence of the levels upon the mass ratio of the interacting particles for any value of the total angular momentum .",
    "it proves that the equations and the results are continuous in the mass ratio , so that they provide a unified scheme ranging from the positronium ( two equal masses ) , to the hydrogen atom and finally to the dirac limit ( one of the masses becomes infinite ) .",
    "although written in a rather compact form , the equations we find are not easy to study analytically .",
    "this means that no simple formula for the energy levels is available as in the case of the dirac equation and numerical procedures are therefore necessary if we want to determine the spectroscopy of the system .",
    "appropriate plots will illustrate the results obtained : from these it will be possible to establish a regular and simple behavior of the energy levels _ vs. _ an appropriate mass ratio parameter .",
    "we find , for instance , that for two finite masses the degeneracy of the dirac levels @xmath5-@xmath6 is removed and for the hydrogen atom we reproduce a small fraction of the entire lamb shift : it is interesting to observe that the correct kinematics gives a not negligible fraction of the splitting .",
    "the continuous dependence of the spectrum upon the ratio of the component masses suggests also in a natural way a perturbative treatment in the neighborhood of the dirac limit . except for the positronium",
    ", the main systems of physical interest  as the hydrogen atom and , at a lesser degree , the muonium and the mesic atom  have a very small mass ratio and can be treated accordingly .",
    "we have shown how to develop this framework and we have applied it to the ground state of the hydrogen atom .    a comparison with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite-@xcite is in order .",
    "indeed , the equations found in our quantum mechanical framework agree with those deduced by different methods in the quoted references , although a bit of work is usually required to reduce the latter . concerning the results",
    ", we may observe that all those papers develop a perturbative approach in the fine structure constant up to @xmath7 ; complete numerical results are given for equal masses , @xcite , and for different masses with a vanishing total angular momentum , @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we find a perturbative formula , corrected up to @xmath7 , expressing the lamb shift due to the coulomb interaction .",
    "the results of that formula are practically coincident with our numerical results for the hydrogen atom , but appear to be less accurate when the masses of the two fermions become closer and closer : the comparison suggests that , at a high degree of accuracy , the perturbation expansions must be treated with some caution and numerical computations appear to be necessary and more reliable .",
    "complete numerical results for equal masses and values zero and one of the angular momentum , are found in @xcite .",
    "the computations are carried out by finite element methods and they are in complete agreement with our results obtained by the numerical solution of a singular boundary value problem .",
    "the authors observe that the positronium presents an inversion in the energy of the two levels indicated as @xmath5 and @xmath8 in the dirac spectroscopy , the first being higher than the second . as a matter of fact",
    "we have drawn the complete plot of these terms for any mass ratio , showing their actual crossing . finally , in the two papers of reference @xcite , quantum field theoretical methods are used to determine the equations for fermion systems under the coulomb and the complete electromagnetic interactions respectively .",
    "the equations are derived by defining an appropriate non conventional vacuum and by studying the conditions to be imposed on the coefficient functions of the states with a fixed number of particles in order to be eigenstates of the particle@xmath9-@xmath9electromagnetic field hamiltonian .",
    "the interest is especially addressed to the properties of the system related to the variation of the coupling constant @xmath10 and the perturbative aspects in terms of @xmath10 are widely developed .",
    "complete numerical results are given for a vanishing value of the angular momentum and perturbative results up to @xmath7 for non vanishing angular momentum .",
    "the wave equation we derive for the two fermions agrees with the results of @xcite , upon restriction to the static coulomb interaction .    the two fermion relativistic bound states are relevant not only for electrodynamical purposes and atomic physics , but also in the framework of phenomenological meson spectroscopy .",
    "the limited progress of the qcd lattice program for the mesons has stimulated the interest in new treatments of the two body quantum systems that could replace the non relativistic quark model @xcite and predict the masses of the mesons , from lighter to the heavier ones , assuming from the experimental data the least number of values for physical quark parameters .",
    "numerical approaches have devised new methods of solving the bethe - salpeter equation with interactions derived from qcd effective potentials , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "new wave equations from the quantization of constraint theories have been proposed in a long series of papers , see @xcite , @xcite and references therein .",
    "the authors start from two coupled dirac equations ; using the poincar symmetry and some supersymmetric ideas , they are able to determine the general structure of the interactions compatible with the constraint scheme . the application to the phenomenology of mesons gives a very good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "we have written this paper trying to make it self - consistent .",
    "some details of the computations have been explained in the appendixes .",
    "a brief summary is as follows . in section [ sec_classical ]",
    "we recall the basic definitions and we establish the kinematics and the dynamics of the system together with their invariance properties and their validity in any reference frame . in section [ sec_quantization ]",
    "the quantization procedure is explained and applied to the relativistic two fermion problem . in section [ sec_spectrum ]",
    "we deduce the equations for an arbitrary scalar potential . given the general form of the state vector with definite energy , angular momentum and parity  whose explicit expression involves eight unknown functions and is reported in appendix a  we give a short , transparent and comprehensive deduction of the equations for the unknown functions and we specify them to the particular case of the coulomb interaction .",
    "the computations leading to the final result are sketched in appendix b. the dirac limit is treated in section [ sec_dirac ] : here we present a procedure that permits to recover continuously the dirac equation for the finite mass constituent when the mass of the other goes to infinity . finally , in section [ sec_results ] we discuss the numerical results with @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 for the whole range of masses : the results for @xmath0 should be compared with a first order perturbative approach in the ratio of the constituent masses , described in appendix c. some few details of the numerical procedure are given in appendix d. in the final appendix e we report on some details of the ground state of the positronium .",
    "in particular we calculate the wave function of the parapositronium and orthopositronium , we show that the non relativistic limit correctly reproduces the schrdinger equation for the coulomb problem and we make some comments on the hyperfine splitting .    in the paper we shall use a unit system with @xmath11 , and for the presentation of the results we also assume the electron mass equal to unity .",
    "[ sec_classical ]    we first outline the procedure for two classical scalar particles with given masses @xmath12 , @xmath13 , whose individual minkowski coordinates are denoted by @xmath14 and whose canonical conjugate momenta are @xmath15 . starting from the collective coordinates    @xmath16      we can remark that the variables ( [ variabili ] ) arise quite naturally as global and relative coordinates in a two body poincar invariant dynamics constructed by using the algebraic and coalgebraic properties of the weyl homogeneous spaces .",
    "indeed a four component position operator for each constituent is built in terms of the generators of the corresponding weyl algebra , whose non trivial cohomology permits to deduce global and relative operators .",
    "the breaking of the scale invariance leaves the resulting dynamical system poincar symmetric , @xcite .",
    "this procedure , although different in the algebraic assumptions and in the results , presents clear analogies with the classic paper @xcite , ( see also subsequent literature , _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite@xmath9 ) , where the two body theory was for the first time coherently based on the algebra of the poincar generators corresponding to each particle .    using ( [ variabili ] ) , the mass shell conditions for each of the two particles read @xmath30 from which @xmath31 therefore the total mass @xmath32 results in @xmath33 while the variable @xmath34 can be fixed , generating a symplectic reduction of the phase space .",
    "its conjugate coordinate @xmath35  the relative time coordinate  is cyclic and assumes the character of a gauge function that is chosen _ a posteriori _ in order to recover the complete minkowski description for the two particles .",
    "in particular cases it could be useful to fix @xmath36 , but in principle there is no necessity of requiring such condition .",
    "it is finally straightforward to construct a lorentz covariant dynamics by introducing nontrivial interaction terms depending only upon @xmath26 and @xmath25 .",
    "one of the simplest choices is to add scalar potentials that are functions of the lorentz scalar @xmath37 .",
    "hence , a relativistic two - body system interacting by means of a potential @xmath38 is described by @xmath39 with @xmath40 the equation of the orbits for the coulomb interaction , @xmath41 , is obtained from the canonical equations deduced from ( [ p2a ] ) . introducing the variables @xmath42 and @xmath43 defined by @xmath44 and denoting by @xmath45 the value of the conserved angular momentum , the equation reads @xmath46 and it can be integrated in terms of elliptic functions ( see @xcite for details ) . in the case of equal masses , @xmath47 , the solution for the orbits can be given in terms of elementary functions .",
    "for instance , for @xmath48  the most relevant case from our point of view as it gives bounded orbits  the solution is @xmath49\\,^{1/2 } \\bigr)-\\lambda\\,\\alpha\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and corresponds to the motion of a particle in an external coulomb field ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "[ sec_quantization ]    the next step is the quantization of equation ( [ p2a ] ) with @xmath50 .",
    "the scalar quantization of the double square root hamiltonian has received many attentions and has been discussed also recently in terms of functional inequalities , @xcite . however , since most of the physically interesting situations involve fermionic components , we assume particles of that nature and we quantize the system accordingly .",
    "the dirac operators corresponding to each single particle are @xmath51    where we have introduced the following tensor products of gamma matrices @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the unity matrix in four dimensions .",
    "the operators @xmath54 and @xmath55 can be rewritten in terms of the canonical set ( [ variabili ] ) . at the same time",
    "the constant @xmath56-matrices will be recast in terms of the new set of matrices @xmath57 , where @xmath58 the two dirac equations ( [ dirac1 - 2 ] ) become then @xmath59 we observe that the square of @xmath60 gives the unity matrix .",
    "we next multiply the equations ( [ dirac12 ] ) on the left by @xmath61 and @xmath62 respectively and we obtain @xmath63 by summing and subtracting we finally get    [ diracnew ] @xmath64    the right hand sides of the two equations ( [ diracnew ] ) are commuting . multiplying those equations term by term , we get @xmath65 and we see that the variable @xmath34 remains fixed , in complete agreement with the classical symplectic reduction . in fact the canonical conjugate relative time coordinate @xmath35 is cyclic again : this is signified , in particular , by the lorentz scalar identity for the phase of plane waves @xmath66 we finally observe that the definition ( [ gammap ] ) is actually a lorentz transformation on the @xmath67 four vector determining a unitary transformation . therefore , as long as @xmath68 is conserved , the matrices ( [ gammap ] ) will be represented by the usual @xmath69 matrices .",
    "the different behavior under lorentz transformations is however signified by the use of the notation ( [ gammap ] ) . in conclusion equation ( [ diracnew1 ] ) is the lorentz - invariant equation for the two - fermion system .",
    "it is also straightforward to calculate the explicit expressions for the sixteen eigenvalues @xmath70 and the result is rather obvious .",
    "in fact we have four singular values @xmath71 each one with multiplicity four . defining @xmath72",
    "we make a linear transformation on the tensor product of the two spinor spaces that diagonalizes the system at rest , in such a way that the four singular values ( [ singval ] ) appear in the order @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "we find it also convenient to perform a further linear transformation that , in each four dimensional eigenspace , diagonalizes the square and the third component of the total spin @xmath77 @xmath78 being the dirac spin .",
    "for each singular value of the mass , the diagonalized spin will then be ordered with the triplet always following the singlet .",
    "the wave equation will now be obtained by applying the canonical quantization rules to the equation ( [ diracnew1 ] ) . in view of the bases",
    "we have chosen , the natural coordinates to be used are the spherical ones , in terms of which the free hamiltonian operator reads @xmath79 where each matrix element is actually an @xmath80 block . explicitly @xmath81 and @xmath82    the matrix elements in ( [ xi ] ) are the spherical operators @xmath83 where @xmath84 .",
    "we finally remind that the global parity transformation is given by the product of orbital and internal parity transformations . in our picture",
    "the internal parity is given by @xmath85    it is straightforward to verify that the global angular momentum @xmath86 and the parity are conserved . together with @xmath70 they provide a classification of the states of the global symmetry . concerning the problem of canonical realization , poincar representations and invariant scalar products we refer to the paper @xcite .",
    "it is also straightforward to observe that the conservations properties keep holding in the presence of interactions depending upon the lorentz scalars @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 : this fact will be used in the next section to determine a reduced set of differential equations and to state the boundary value problem in the space of the square - integrable functions on the relative @xmath90 .",
    "[ sec_spectrum ]    the construction of the states with assigned angular momentum @xmath91 and given parity @xmath92 or @xmath93 is done as usual , by multiplying the contributions coming from the composition of orbital and intrinsic angular momenta by functions of @xmath94 .",
    "the expressions of the states @xmath95 and @xmath96 are reported in equations ( [ statopari ] ) and ( [ statodispari ] ) given in appendix a.    the eigenvalue problem comes out when we try to determine the eight unknown function @xmath97 in the state @xmath98 by solving the homogeneous equation @xmath99 with @xmath100 as in ( [ h(r ) ] ) . since the parity and the angular momentum are conserved , equation ( [ eigeneq ] ) produces two different spectral problems to be discussed separately .",
    "when substituting @xmath102 in ( [ eigeneq ] ) , we obtain a system of equations given by the vanishing of the coefficients of the different spherical harmonics in each component of the resulting vector .",
    "this system is composed of thirty - four first order differential equations , but , as one should expect , only eight of them are independent .",
    "the detailed expressions for the eight equations are written in appendix b.    it turns out that appropriate changes of the initial variables can help in giving the system a much simpler and readable form . to this purpose",
    ", we first define the sums and differences @xmath103 and we consider the following linear combinations of the @xmath104 and @xmath105 : @xmath106 a rather simple formulation for the system can then be given in terms of @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 . indeed , from a straightforward computation , we find that the eight independent equations split into four algebraic relations and four first order differential equations .",
    "the former read @xmath111 while the differential equations are    @xmath112    by means of ( [ relalgeven ] ) we eliminate the four variables that are not differentiated , obtaining a system of four first order differential equations in the four unknown functions @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 . if we arrange the latter respectively as the four components of a vector @xmath117 , the system is given the compact form @xmath118 where @xmath119 is a matrix with general structure @xmath120 \\phantom{-}{g}(r)~ & \\phantom{-}0~ & \\phantom{- } { \\displaystyle \\frac { 2}{r}}~   & \\phantom{-}e(r)~ \\spazio{1.2}\\\\ [ 2ex ] \\phantom{-}0~ &   - { g}(r)~ & \\phantom{-}e(r)~ &   \\phantom{-}{\\displaystyle \\frac { 1}{r}}~   \\end{array } }   \\right ]   \\label{sysmat}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the explicit expressions of @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 for the even case are the following ones    [ equauvw ] @xmath124    specifying the matrix elements ( [ equauvw ] ) to the case of the coulomb interaction , where @xmath125 and where @xmath10 is the fine structure constant , we have    [ equauvw_c ] @xmath126    some remarks are in order .",
    "first of all , from ( [ sysmat ] ) and ( [ equauvw ] ) we see that the transformation @xmath127 is a symmetry of the system , corresponding to the fact that the ordering of the two particle is irrelevant .    in the second place , from ( [ equa_u ] )",
    ", we see that @xmath128 either for @xmath0 or @xmath129 . in these cases",
    "the fourth order system splits into separate second order subsystems , one for the functions @xmath130 and @xmath131 , the other for @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "the subsystems , in turn , can be presented as the following two independent second order differential equations    [ u0pari ] @xmath134    as discussed in section [ sec_dirac ] , the dirac limit shows that for @xmath0 only ( [ u0pari_1 ] ) makes sense .",
    "although the linear system ( [ sistema_mat ] ) and , in particular , the equation ( [ u0pari_1 ] ) do not look extremely complicated , they still are difficult enough to prevent the possibility of an easy analytical solution .",
    "for instance , according to a somewhat old fashioned  but actually still the most up to date ",
    "classification of differential equations according to the number of their elementary singularities ( for definitions and detail we refer to the classical text @xcite ) , equations ( [ u0pari ] ) with the coulomb coefficients ( [ equauvw_c ] ) present eight elementary singularities , while analytical properties of the solutions have been studied and classified for differential equations having at most six elementary singularities .",
    "numerical techniques are therefore necessary if we want to determine the spectral properties , both for equal and different masses .",
    "the differential equations generated by the action of the hamiltonian on the odd state are easily derived by observing that the transformation ( [ statodispari ] ) amounts to changing @xmath136 into @xmath137 , which means @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "the general structure for the matrix of the odd linear system , therefore , remains the one given in ( [ sysmat ] ) .",
    "the matrix elements , on the other hand , are as follows :    [ equauvw_odd ] @xmath140    and also the coulomb explicit expressions are obtained from ( [ equauvw_c ] ) by the exchanges @xmath141 .",
    "the system decouples for @xmath0 , but , in contrast to what occurs in the even case , this circumstance is not realized when the particles have equal masses .",
    "[ sec_dirac ]    in this section we prove that ( [ sistema_mat]-[sysmat ] ) has the correct dirac limit .",
    "this means that when the mass of one of the two interacting particles , say @xmath136 , tends to infinity , the system reduces to the dirac equation for a charged fermion in an external potential .",
    "the limit is defined by assuming that the mass @xmath142 remains finite and gives the mass scale .",
    "the rescaling of the mass parameters of the system is then @xmath143 we also take a dimensionless independent variable @xmath144 and define a coefficient @xmath145 by means of the relation @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the potential expressed in terms of @xmath148 and divided by @xmath149 .",
    "it proves it convenient to define the shorthand @xmath150 we now take the limit @xmath151 on the matrix elements . for the even system in the dimensionless variable @xmath148",
    ", we find @xmath152 for the odd system : @xmath153 let us prove that the equations obtained by the use of ( [ diarcpari ] ) and ( [ diarcdispari ] ) are actually equivalent to pairs of dirac equations @xcite , that we write in our rescaled variables as @xmath154 it is not difficult to realize that a mixing is necessary in order to decouple the fourth order system in two second order subsystems to be compared to the dirac equation .",
    "this is physically clear , since from a description focusing on the angular momentum properties of the bosonic global system , we want to determine the equation for a fermionic object that constitutes only a part of the compound .",
    "the required linear transformation is generated by the orthogonal constant matrix    @xmath155    by defining @xmath156 it is straightforward to see that both in the even and the odd case the equations for the variables @xmath157 and @xmath158 decouple from the equations for @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "the comparison with ( [ dirac_sys ] ) shows that , the subsystems obtained in the even case are respectively the dirac equations with @xmath161 and @xmath162 ( here we must change @xmath160 into @xmath163 ) : these are the two allowed values of @xmath164 for the states whose orbital momentum is @xmath165 in the dirac spectroscopy , @xcite . in the odd case",
    "the decoupled systems agree respectively with the dirac equations with @xmath166 ( here changing @xmath158 into @xmath167 ) and @xmath168 : these values correspond to orbital angular momenta equal to @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "the previous discussion clearly shows that the complete treatment is continuous in the parameter @xmath171 : indeed , when this parameter is small , it can be effectively used computing perturbative corrections to the dirac equation .",
    "thus , although the general features of the spectrum  _ e.g. _ its boundedness from below  are clearly dependent upon the potential function @xmath147 and can be studied in each particular case by well established criteria @xcite , the continuity in @xmath171 of the differential operator implies the continuity in @xmath171 of its spectrum that therefore shares the qualitative properties of the limiting case .",
    "we report in appendix c the calculation of the first order correction to the hydrogen ground state and we find an excellent agreement with the numerical results .",
    "[ sec_results ]    in this section we present the results obtained .",
    "we display the tables containing the values of the variable @xmath172 and the corresponding level with ten meaningful figures ; the corresponding plots are then drawn .",
    "the energy parameter @xmath173 that appears both in the tables and in the plots is related to the parameter @xmath145 defined in ( [ eta ] ) by the relation @xmath174 in terms of the eigenvalue @xmath70 , this equation is equivalent to @xmath175 , where @xmath176 is the classical reduced mass @xmath177 .",
    "this means that the correction of energy levels due to the classical reduction to the center of mass frame is already accounted by the scale .",
    "hence , the dependence upon @xmath172 shown below is a genuine relativistic effect .    the results will be given in atomic units , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath178 in addition to @xmath179 and @xmath180",
    ". the values of @xmath172 with greater physical relevance are @xmath181 , corresponding to the hydrogen atom , @xmath182 , that refers to the mesic atom and @xmath183 , for the positronium .",
    "the value of @xmath173 for @xmath184 has been taken from the analytical formula for the dirac spectrum .",
    "it is natural to begin from the ground state .",
    "we find that for any value of the two fermion masses the lowest energy level is degenerate with multiplicity two and the corresponding states are the first ( _ i.e. _ with lowest eigenvalue ) even state with @xmath0 and the first odd state with @xmath1 .",
    "we specify the results in the table here below and we shall comment on the degeneracy later on .    [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     from the data we discover one more degeneracy : indeed the even state @xmath185 and the odd state @xmath186 , obviously equal in the dirac limit , remain degenerate for any value of @xmath187 .",
    "this occurrence , in the present case and for the fundamental state as well , is certainly not evident from a mathematical or computational point of view : indeed the equations that have been solved to find the even spectral curves and the systems that give the the odd ones are completely unrelated .",
    "we can however understand this apparently peculiar behavior by thinking of the non relativistic limit . here , unless the spin - orbit coupling is explicitly included , the total spin and the orbital angular momentum are separately conserved .",
    "moreover , if no spin - spin interaction is present , the relative orientations of the two spins between themselves and with respect to the orbital angular momentum are effective in determining the parity , but have no influence on energy of the state .",
    "the result is that the even and the odd states are degenerate with respect to parity .",
    "this degeneracy survives in the dirac limit : although the spin - orbit interaction is now directly accounted for , one of the two constituent particles is infinitely heavy and thus at rest , so that only the spin of the light particle matters .",
    "the situation is different in our relativistic equation , when both constituents have finite mass and each of them gives its own contribution to the spin - orbit coupling : in fact we obtain different shifts for the even and odd terms , but for those states that in the non relativistic limit have a vanishing orbital angular momentum . in the particular case of the positronium , we see that the two states @xmath188 and @xmath189 correspond to parapositronium and orthopositronium respectively .",
    "their degeneracy could be removed by introducing the spin - spin interaction , responsible for the hyperfine splitting .",
    "we shall comment on this subject in appendix e.    coming back to the figures , we observe that the solid curves are the parabolas obtained by the best fit of the data and they are in excellent agreement with the data themselves . the perturbative formula given in @xcite for the coulomb lamb shift , @xmath190 , can reproduce a parabolic behavior only for @xmath172 in the neighborhood of zero or unity .",
    "only the second of these possibilities is actually realized : this shows the necessity of a more detailed numerical analysis when the masses become closer and closer .",
    "it is nevertheless interesting to observe the increasing impact of the relativistic effects with the decreasing of the mass difference . in particular",
    "it has to be noticed the crossing of the levels @xmath185 and @xmath191 as well as @xmath186 and @xmath192 : this , for instance , reflects the necessity of the different method in use to classify the positronium states with respect to the dirac scheme .",
    "we conclude this discussion of the results with some observations on a possible formulation of a more realistic model involving a minimal coupling that accounts for the complete electrodynamical interaction .",
    "in fact this type of coupling can be arranged quite easily in our quantum mechanical framework and , if we study the case of a closed two - body system and we do want to keep a pure relativistic quantum mechanical description , we can try to express the vector potential itself in terms of the dynamical variables of the two particles .",
    "the linard - wiechert potentials provide the most natural answer to the raised question .",
    "unfortunately they introduce a delay in the propagation of the interaction that induces a considerable amount of difficulty in the solution of the corresponding wave equation and indeed the necessity of rendering its solution less tough is a major source of approximations , that , in most cases , produce not very satisfactory results ( see @xcite and references therein for a discussion on the subject ) .",
    "indeed if one stops at the lowest order of approximation in the linard - wiechert potentials , neglecting the the propagation delay , one finds an interaction energy @xmath193 that has to be substituted to @xmath38 in ( [ h(r ) ] ) . according to the dirac prescription , when switching to quantum mechanics , the particle velocities @xmath194 will be substituted by the @xmath195 matrices , so to obtain an invariant formulation of the breit approximation for the electromagnetic interaction .",

    ", is therefore what it is usually computed .",
    "the calculation can be found in @xcite and produces a perfect cancellation of the @xmath7-perturbative coulomb splitting . from the previous discussion it is clear that the result should be tested numerically using the relativistic coulomb wave functions for any value of the mass ratio .",
    "this numerical test is however beyond the purpose of the present paper . in any case  and as it was certainly to be expected  it appears that the acceleration and delay effects of the linard - wiechert potentials  and therefore the radiative corrections ",

    "we give here the explicit form of the 16 component state vectors of definite energy , angular momentum @xmath91 and even and odd parity with respect to the angular momentum , namely @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "we call them @xmath95 and @xmath96 respectively .",
    "the even state is then given by @xmath197 the four components is actually multiplets composed by a singlet and a triplet and will be indicated as : @xmath198 where @xmath199 . according to a common practice and in order to deduce real differential equations in the following appendix b , we shall introduce an imaginary unity in front of the coefficient functions @xmath200 and @xmath201 the explicit expressions of the state vector components are the following : @xmath202 where @xmath203 are the spherical harmonic functions . concerning the state with opposite parity , it can be seen that the action of the parity transformation is simply the exchange of the first eight components with the second eight ones .",
    "therefore , in order to determine the differential equations describing the odd states of the system , we shall use the state @xmath96 given by @xmath204 as observed in section iv.b this amounts to changing the sign of the mass @xmath205 .",
    "as we said in section ( iv.a ) , in order to determine the system of differential equations describing the two body problem , we shall apply the hamiltonian operator @xmath206 , given in ( [ h ] ) , to the state vector ( [ statopari ] ) . in each component",
    "we require the vanishing of the coefficient of each different spherical harmonics .",
    "this leads to a system of thirty - four differential equations in the unknown functions @xmath207 that appear in the state vector .",
    "however , as expected , only eight of these differential equations are independent .",
    "they read    [ original_system ] @xmath208    once the definitions ( [ variabilipm ] ) and ( [ varuvpm ] ) are used , a straightforward , although somewhat lengthy computation , leads directly to ( [ relalgeven ] ) and ( [ diffeqeven ] ) .",
    "we now present a perturbative approach to the ground level of the hydrogen atom , taking as perturbation parameter the quantity @xmath209",
    "as we have said in section [ sec_spectrum ] , for @xmath0 the system splits in two subsystems obtained by ( [ sistema_mat]-[sysmat ] ) , or , equivalently , by the second order equation ( [ u0pari_1 ] ) . for later convenience in the development of the perturbative calculations we introduce the modified unknown functions @xmath210 defined by @xmath211 in particular we see that second order equation ( [ u0pari_1 ] ) written in terms of @xmath212 does not present the first derivative term : @xmath213 for @xmath122 and @xmath123 we shall then assume their coulomb explicit form ( [ equauvw ] ) .",
    "finally , the parameters are rescaled according to ( [ massrescale]-[h_x ] ) and , correspondingly , we write the series expansions of the eigenvalue and the eigenfunction components in terms of @xmath214 : @xmath215    at the lowest order in @xmath216 we have the system @xmath217 in which we obviously recognize the dirac equation for @xmath0 .",
    "the solution of the system have therefore the well known expressions , @xcite , @xmath218 where @xmath219 while the parameters of the confluent hypergeometric functions are @xmath220 finally @xmath221 is the normalizing constant that obviously makes sense only when assuming the spectral condition @xmath222 with integer @xmath223 . letting @xmath224 the value for the ground state of the dirac equation is @xmath225 .",
    "we now switch the perturbative machine on . in the first place we observe that , according to ( [ phitheta ] ) , the functions @xmath226 and @xmath227 are just obtained by the product with the limiting value of the rescaled multiplicative factor , _",

    "this result is in excellent agreement with what is found from the numerical integration , as presented in section [ sec_results ] .",
    "when applied to muonium , @xcite , where we have @xmath238 , the correction would amount to @xmath239 .",
    "we outline the numerical methods used to integrate the even and odd fourth - order differential systems and to find the spectrum . for the numerical treatment",
    "we have rewritten the mass parameters in the systems according to the definitions ( [ massrescale]-[h_x ] ) and we have adopted the independent variable @xmath240 .    as a first remark , we see that both systems are singular at zero and infinity . therefore , in order to start the numerical integration , the appropriate asymptotic solutions at the two singular points must be determined by the appropriate developments .",
    "we report here below and separately on some further details of these solutions . as a general feature , however",
    ", it turns out that among the four independent solutions that can be determined at each singular point , two of them are divergent and would produce not square - integrable wave functions , _",
    "i.e. _ outside of the hilbert space where we want to solve the spectral problem .",
    "these solutions will therefore be rejected .",
    "once the two acceptable solutions in zero and infinity have been determined , the eigenvalue will be obtained by adapting to our problem the well known ",
    "double shooting method \" .",
    "more precisely , for each of the acceptable solutions both at zero and at infinity we start the numerical integration up to a chosen crossing point @xmath241 . in @xmath241 we impose the matching conditions for each component of the wave function . these give rise to the following linear system : @xmath242 where @xmath243 . the first superscripts",
    " @xmath244 \" and  @xmath245 \" evidently refer to the singular point where the integration started , while the second subscripts  @xmath246 \" and  @xmath247 \" denote the solution chosen at each boundary .",
    "being linear and homogeneous , the system ( [ sistemack ] ) has nontrivial solutions in @xmath248 and @xmath249 provided its determinant is vanishing .",
    "the condition @xmath250    gives therefore the equation that has to be solved in order to find the spectral values @xmath70 .",
    "needless to say that when the system decouples in two separate second order differential equations , no additional modification to the usual double shooting method is necessary and each equation has been solved independently .",
    "we now describe the behavior at the singular points of the two systems .",
    "we shall first consider the behavior of the systems at the origin by expanding the equations of each system in a neighborhood of @xmath251 .",
    "accordingly , the solutions will be assumed of the form @xmath252 the procedure is the standard one .",
    "we substitute ( [ serie_y ] ) into the system ( [ sistema_mat ] ) and take the different orders in @xmath148 .",
    "the lowest order gives the indicial equations that produce four different values for the exponent @xmath253 , only two of which are acceptable . in correspondence to the indices , some relations for the @xmath254 are established .",
    "it also turns out that the indices are equal both for the even and the odd systems .",
    "we have a first index @xmath255 with corresponding relations @xmath256 and a second index ( only for @xmath257 ) @xmath258 for which @xmath259    the corresponding ( very cumbersome ) series have been calculated formally up to the eight order and have been tested by substitution in the differential equations with the help of a symbolic computer package .",
    "they have also been tested numerically , with physical values of the parameters and varying value of the coordinate @xmath148 .",
    "in addition , this procedure has furnished an effective criterion for choosing the boundary point near zero : in fact we have assumed as acceptable a value of @xmath148 where the ratio of the differential equation evaluated on the solution over the solution itself was at most of the order of @xmath260 .      in order to determine the solutions in the neighborhood of infinity we consider the following asymptotic expansion for the components of the solution",
    "must be looked in the form ( see @xcite ) @xmath261 contrary to what occurs in zero , also the indices of the asymptotic expansion depend upon the eigenvalue @xmath70 . at the lowest order , indeed , we find @xmath262 and we shall take the positive square root to insure the convergence .",
    "the next order determines the exponent @xmath253 , given by @xmath263 the different choices of the two coefficients @xmath264 and @xmath265 determine then two different series and therefore two linearly independent asymptotic solutions of the system .",
    "once the spectrum has been found , we can proceed to determine the wave function . if @xmath266 is one of the spectral values , then , in the system ( [ sistemack ] ) we can fix one of the four parameters @xmath267 to unity and solve for the remaining ones . for instance for the hydrogen atom and the @xmath268 state of the dirac spectroscopy , for which @xmath269 , we find @xmath270 therefore the complete wave function will result in @xmath271 the plot of @xmath272 ig given in the following figure :         fig .",
    "3 the first component of the wave function of the coulomb hydrogen atom for the @xmath273 state .",
    "in this last appendix we give some details on the two wave functions of the ground state of the parapositronium and orthopositronium corresponding to the states @xmath188 and @xmath274 , degenerate in energy .",
    "we finally comment on the calculation of the hyperfine splitting of the positronium ground level .",
    "the case of the parapositronium , namely the state with even parity , is comparatively easy , since it can be solved by discussing the single second order differential equation ( [ u0pari_1 ] ) for the coulomb potential , with @xmath183 and @xmath0 .",
    "its explicit form reads : @xmath275 zero and infinity are the two singular points of this equation . at infinity",
    "there is a divergent and a convergent solution , so that the latter will be assumed . in zero",
    "both solutions are divergent , and only one of them , the solution we shall accept , is normalizable .",
    "the regular solution in zero has the following expansion : @xmath276 where @xmath277 is an arbitrary integration constant .    the asymptotic behavior of the solution by taking the dominant term of ( [ equaposiparifd1 ] ) , at infinity .",
    "the solution of the corresponding asymptotic equation reads @xmath278 where @xmath279 is an arbitrary integration constant .",
    "however for calculating a better approximation to the asymptotic boundary conditions we can take the expansion of ( [ equaposiparifd1 ] ) up to terms of order @xmath280 . in fact the resulting equation can be exactly solved in terms of whittaker @xmath73 and @xmath281 functions . up to the usual integration constant we can fix equal to unity , the solution with regular behavior at infinity is : @xmath282    once the boundary behaviors are established , the wave function component @xmath272 and its first derivative @xmath283 are computed by standard numerical integration .",
    "finally , in order to determine the complete sixteen component wave function , we only have to calculate the eight coefficient functions @xmath284 and @xmath285 , @xmath286 , in terms of @xmath272 and its first derivative @xmath283 . recalling that @xmath287 , and that from ( [ sistema_mat ] ) and ( [ sysmat])we have @xmath288 simple substitutions lead to the following expressions : @xmath289 the components @xmath272 and @xmath290 are respectively represented in the first plot of fig .",
    "4 .      let us then consider the wave function for the odd state . the system to be discussed",
    "is now given by ( [ sistema_mat ] - [ sysmat ] - [ equauvw_c ] ) with @xmath183 and @xmath1 .",
    "considering the series expansion in the origin , we see that we have two regular solutions with indices @xmath291 on the other side , the asymptotic expansion gives then solutions presenting the exponential decrease @xmath292 exactly the same as for parapositronium",
    ".      letting @xmath294 be the matrix @xmath295 the explicit relationships among the four components @xmath296 and the eight coefficients of the complete state vector , @xmath297 @xmath286 are the following : @xmath298 and @xmath299              in order to have a better insight into the solutions of the para- and orthopositronium ground states , we find it useful to look at the schrdinger limit of the relativistic system and to show how the usual equations for the coulomb problem are recovered .",
    "in addition to the obvious substitutions @xmath307 and @xmath308 , the non relativistic limit on the system ( [ sistema_mat ] -[sysmat ] ) needs the use of the  atomic parameters \" .",
    "this means that we have to adopt the following rescaling for the independent variable and for the eigenvalue : @xmath309 as already noted in ( [ evenpsi ] ) , when dealing with the even problem and assuming the coefficient functions ( [ equauvw_c ] ) , the system ( [ sistema_mat ] -[sysmat ] ) decouples in two separate subsystems , the first one for @xmath310 and @xmath311 , the second for @xmath312 and @xmath313 .",
    "thus , isolating @xmath314 , @xmath315 substituting it into the equation for @xmath316 and taking the limit @xmath317 , we find @xmath318 in which we recognize the usual @xmath319 radial coulomb equation , that gives the well known exponential solution @xmath320 , when @xmath0 and @xmath321 .",
    "the analogous treatment for the second subsystem leads exactly to the same result .    for the odd case , assuming the coefficients ( [ equauvw_odd ] ) , the system resulting from ( [ sistema_mat ] -[sysmat ] ) does not decouple : as a consequence the treatment is just a little bit technically more complicated . in order to determine the non relativistic limit we have to look for the equations satisfied by the  large \" components of the wave function . as shown in fig .",
    "4 , they are @xmath311 and @xmath313 . therefore , after changing to the atomic variables , we isolate @xmath310 and @xmath312 from the last two equations of the system and we substitute the results in the first two ones . taking the limit for @xmath317 , we get the following system of two coupled second order differential equations : @xmath322 the differential operators of both equations of ( [ schrposiodd ] ) coincide .",
    "the matrix of the non - differentiated terms @xmath323   \\ ] ] is diagonalized by the constant matrix @xmath324\\ , .   \\ ] ] therefore , letting @xmath325 we obtain the two decoupled equations @xmath326 corresponding to the radial coulomb equations with @xmath327 and @xmath328 .      comparing the limiting classical wave functions with the results reported in fig .",
    "4 , it appears that the relativistic corrections become weaker and weaker for large @xmath329 , as expected by obvious physical reasons . near zero",
    "the bare coulomb potential is no more sufficient for an accurate description of the system and , as observed also in case of the lamb shift , the radiative corrections due to the self energy and to the vacuum polarization should be accounted for .",
    "the length that , on a physical basis , can be assumed as a scale for the relevance of the mentioned relativistic effects is the compton wavelength of the electron @xmath330 : it is interesting to remark that the sharp maximum of all the components of the orthopositronium occurs approximately at @xmath331 .",
    "these considerations can be brought to bear to a possible evaluation of the hyperfine shift of the ground states of the para- and orthopositronium .",
    "indeed the usual and very successful derivation of the shifts of the two ground levels is done by a perturbative method in a non relativistic approximation .",
    "of course , in view of the discussion of the previous subsection , we are able to obtain exactly the same results if we adopt the non relativistic approximation and the same expressions for the spin - spin interaction and for the annihilation energy term .",
    "the latter are derived as effective potentials from a low momentum expansion of the one - photon exchange feynman diagram , @xcite , and the value of the hyperfine shifts of the ground levels are produced by the sum of two different contributions .",
    "the first one is the average of @xmath332 and therefore implies the evaluation of the classical coulomb wave function at zero , as in the original fermi calculation @xcite .",
    "this approach can not be directly used with the wave function we have produced , since the relativistic effects naturally lead to a drastic modification of their behavior just in the origin .",
    "the averaging over the angles of the other term , @xmath333 giving a rigorously vanishing value in the non relativistic limit , is now negligible only for for large values of @xmath94 as expected , but it is divergent in the origin , even after the radial measure @xmath334 has been accounted for .",
    "one could try to determine a phenomenological value of the radial coordinate where to put a kind of cut - off both for the evaluation of the wave functions and for the integrations as well .",
    "however , in order to use the relativistic quantum mechanics for calculating the hyperfine splitting , we believe it would be much more appealing to deduce an effective interaction potential without assuming a low momentum approximation and including radiative corrections .",
