    "likewise , tn j09242201 has a size that is comparable to the average size of @xmath12-dropouts @xcite , while tn j13381942 is an exceptionally large ( @xmath11 ) galaxy .",
    "if tn j09242201 is to develop into a similar source within the @xmath222 myr or so between @xmath13 and @xmath223 , it would require an increase in the projected radio source size by a factor @xmath224 , in ly@xmath1  luminosity by a factor @xmath225 , in sfr by a factor of @xmath185 , and in uv size by at least a factor of 2 .",
    "the recent detection of molecular gas ( co ) by @xcite suggests that there is @xmath226 of ( inferred ) gas mass present .",
    "the rapid enrichment that brought about this reservoir of molecular gas could have been facilitated by the early formation of the radio source and the triggering of massive star formation .",
    "the amount of gas present shows that there is plenty of material available to sustain a high sfr of several @xmath227 yr@xmath8 , possibly allowing this source to undergo dramatic changes in its uv luminosity and morphology during certain stages of its evolution .",
    "we have presented statistical evidence for an overdensity of star forming galaxies associated with the radio galaxy tn j09242201 .",
    "our result is consistent with the overdensity of ly@xmath1  emitters discovered previously by @xcite , and is comparable to overdensities of ly@xmath1  emitters and lyman break galaxies found around other high redshift radio galaxies .",
    "tn j09242201 could be a protocluster that will evolve into a cluster with a mass of @xmath228 m@xmath10 at @xmath28 .",
    "the existence of relatively massive structures in the early universe may not be uncommon , as suggested by , for example , the existence of quasars at even higher redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the evidence for protoclusters out to @xmath229 , and the increasingly higher limit that can be set on the redshift of reionization . regions of high mass concentrations are rare , strongly clustered objects at every redshift , that underwent high amplification since the initial conditions @xcite .",
    "radio galaxies are suspected to be the sites of the formation of a massive galaxy .",
    "the evidence reported of in this paper contributes to the hypothesis that redshift filaments and possibly groups or clusters of galaxies emerged together with these massive galaxies . in the radio - loud agn unification model , the viewing angle relative to",
    "the jet determines whether a galaxy will be seen as a radio galaxy or as a radio - loud quasar @xcite .",
    "it is therefore expected that early galaxy overdensities could , in principle , also be found around high redshift radio - loud quasars .",
    "results indicate that the same may hold for at least some radio - quiet quasars at @xmath230 too ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* stiavelli et al . 2005 ) .    although primordial galaxy overdensities",
    "so far discovered are not solely limited to fields that contain a luminous agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , they hold a strong connection to low redshift clusters due to the presence of a supermassive black hole and possibly a developing brightest cluster galaxy @xcite . when the radio source has switched off",
    ", the host galaxy may become indistinguishable from other relatively massive , quiescent galaxies that may have been active in the past .",
    "the clustering properties and inferred halo masses of the brightest lyman break galaxies suggest that their descendants at @xmath28 fall into groups and clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the number densities of protoclusters , radio galaxies and lyman break galaxy redshift spikes have all been found to be consistent with the abundance of local clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "structures like tn j09242201 provide ideal comparisons with state - of - the - art @xmath231-body simulations .",
    "@xcite found that the descendants of the most massive objects at high redshift ( presumed to be luminous quasars ) can almost exclusively be identified with the most massive clusters at the current epoch .",
    "it might become possible to trace back cluster evolution from the well - studied regimes at @xmath232 to slight overdensities at very high redshifts , possibly up to the epoch of reionization .",
