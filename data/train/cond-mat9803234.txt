    "driven interfaces in random media present several features of interest , both with regard to the morphology of the moving interface as well as the dynamics of the growth process .",
    "experiments have been performed on several sorts of systems , ranging from fluid flow in porous media @xcite to propagation of burning fronts @xcite .",
    "these indicate that the disorder in the medium affects the properties of the interface in a crucial way .",
    "in particular , the large - distance scaling properties differ considerably from those of interfaces in uniform media . in both theoretical and experimental investigations",
    ", it is customary to characterize the spatial structure of the interface by its _ roughness_. the main point of this paper is to show that there is sometimes an unusual sort of pattern formation @xcite in the system , which results in the interface acquiring a _ time - averaged shape_. in such situations , this pattern provides an alternative characterization of interface morphology .    a customary measure of the roughness is provided by the exponent @xmath0 , defined by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the root mean squared width of the interface and @xmath3 is the size of the system .",
    "the experiments mentioned above , and others similar to these , report an anomalously large value of @xmath0  large compared to the predictions of existing theories for interface growth in nonrandom media @xcite .",
    "it is recognised that the quenched nature of the disorder in the medium is responsible for this difference in scaling properties of the interface .",
    "unlike thermal noise , which varies rapidly , a portion of the interface subject to a quenched - noise environment continues to experience the same forces until the growth process takes it forward to a new region .",
    "the pinning effect of quenched noise has a strong effect on the large scale properties of the interface .",
    "several theoretical models have been put forward to try to account for the effect of quenched disorder on the properties of the interface ; @xcite gives an account of some of the early work and the relationship to other problems involving pinning , while @xcite is a a recent review . amongst various proposals put forward to explain anomalous roughening are theories based on continuum equations with quenched disorder @xcite , the inclusion of noise with power - law amplitude @xcite or long - ranged correlation @xcite , power - law distributions of pinning - center strengths @xcite , as well as a class of models with microscopic rules based on directed percolation @xcite and models which relate the large - scale structure to the wetting properties of the invading fluid @xcite .",
    "a number of these models base the explanation of anomalous roughening on the phenomenon of critical depinning , which is relevant to an interface just at the threshold of motion . in the opposite limit of large velocity",
    ", the interface encounters the disorder at any site only for a short time , suggesting that the quenched nature of disorder is not important in this limit , and the interface behaves much as in a nonrandom medium @xcite .",
    "however this is not true at low velocities of the interface near the depinning threshold .",
    "in particular , the limit of zero velocity is thought to be a dynamical critical point @xcite where the scaling properties of the interface are strongly affected by the disorder .    in a certain class of models ,",
    "the quenched disorder enters as barriers of random strengths which impede interface motion .",
    "the formation of infinitely long directed percolating paths of these barriers is of special significance , as such paths can block the entire interface effectively @xcite .",
    "the model proposed by sneppen @xcite involves `` extremal '' dynamics : at each time step , the interface advances only along the weakest of the barriers .",
    "extremal models were first introduced much earlier , in the context of invasion percolation for two - phase fluid flow in porous media , with a non - wetting fluid displacing a wetting one @xcite .",
    "the predictions of this invasion percolation model were borne out by experiments @xcite .",
    "dynamical correlation functions involving the center of activity in invasion percolation obey scaling @xcite , and the process defines a self - organised critical phenomenon @xcite ; the interface organises itself to align along critical paths bordered by large barriers , without the necessity of tuning any external parameters .",
    "the model proposed by sneppen @xcite is a modification of the invasion percolation model , incorporating surface tension effects which prevent very strong local convolutions of the interface , resulting in a self - affine , rather than self - similar , geometry .",
    "an extremal model close to the sneppen model was shown to result @xcite from a model of wetting - fluid invasion , by considering an interface advancing by merging meniscus arcs between adjacent pairs of pinning centers .",
    "an interesting feature of extremal dynamics is that it induces strong spatial correlation in sites at which growth occurs @xcite at successive time steps . in this paper",
    "we introduce and study a variant of the sneppen model and show that the interface develops an interesting time - averaged structure as a result of correlations .",
    "the defining equation for the structure is @xmath4 \\label{eq : pattern}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the position of the active site at time @xmath6 , @xmath7 denotes the height at the site @xmath8 , @xmath9 is a time average in the steady state , and @xmath10 is the overall slope of the interface .",
    "the unusual point is that this structure @xmath11 is not fixed in space , but moves with its center always at the growth site , which itself follows an erratic path .",
    "the moving origin is crucial to the definition , as time averages performed at a fixed point in space reveal no structure at all .",
    "this average structure defines a pattern , and we study its formation numerically and analytically .",
    "figure 1a depicts schematically the activity - centered pattern in height gradients with respect to the moving origin , for the untilted ( @xmath12 ) interface .",
    "as can be seen , the interface develops an overall shape which is described by the height - gradient profile @xmath11 .",
    "the tail of the pattern falls slowly at large distances , as a power law .",
    "the corresponding height profile of the interface @xmath13 with respect to the active site is represented in fig .",
    "the nature of the pattern is sensitive to tilt , and figure 2 shows the height - gradient pattern and height profile for a tilted interface .",
    "we propose that this pattern is a simple way of characterising a new aspect of the morphology of the interface .",
    "traditional ways of characterising the morphology involve , as has already been mentioned , determining the roughness exponent @xmath0 .",
    "however such a definition does not hone in on the overall _ shape _ of the interface . in situations such as",
    "the one considered in this paper when the interface does develop a nontrivial structure , the pattern is a useful quantitative characterization .",
    "an important point about the time - averaged pattern is that eq .",
    "1 defines a one - point correlation function . as such",
    ", it would be expected to strongly influence the properties of customary two - point correlation functions .",
    "we verify this by numerically studying two - point correlations .",
    "further we find that this sort of pattern formation is not restricted only to the sneppen model , but also occurs in other extremal models , such as the zaitsev model for low - temperature creep @xcite and the bak - sneppen model @xcite of biological evolution , albeit in other quantities .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce our model and discuss the connection with the problem of directed percolation , well established from earlier studies . in section iii ,",
    "we discuss the correlations in the location of successive growth sites , a concept central to this paper because of its connection with pattern formation . in sections",
    "iv and v we define the pattern and present numerical results as well as an integral equation which provides an understanding of this sort of pattern formation .",
    "we define a model for which the equation is exact and discuss how the approximation can be improved . in section",
    "vi , we discuss the issue of temporal correlations with a view to seeing how they affect the pattern . in section vii",
    ", we present our results for an ordinary two - point correlation function in our model and show that activity - centered pattern formation has to be taken into account in order to understand some features in it . section viii deals with pattern formation in other extremal models and we conclude with a summary of our results in section ix .",
    "the extremal - model description of fluid - fluid interfaces in porous media is valid when the wetting is dominated by capillary forces , and thermal fluctuations are not important . in the extremal model ,",
    "the interface advances along the weakest barrier just ahead of it .",
    "the appealing feature of the model is that it is self - organised critical ; the dynamics , which involves searches for the global minimum at every step , automatically tunes the interface to a critical state at the depinning transition , without the necessity of fixing any external parameter . in the model proposed by sneppen @xcite",
    ", the random medium is modelled by a square lattice in which the sites are assigned random numbers @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "the random numbers could signify , for instance , the pore sizes in a porous medium .",
    "the interface is a directed path on this lattice and grows only at that perimeter bond with the smallest value of the random number ; after every such move , a local rearrangement process @xcite ensures the absence of very large slopes .",
    "extremal dynamics has also been proposed to describe very different situations  for instance , the phenomenon of low - temperature dislocation creep @xcite , crack propagation @xcite and biological evolution @xcite .",
    "we will see in section viii that the sort of pattern formation we find in the interface model occurs in these models as well .",
    "we study a modified version of the sneppen model in this paper . in this version , hereafter referred to as the extremal bond model ( ebm ) , the interface is taken to be a directed path on a square lattice ( fig .",
    "3 ) , with tilted cylindrical boundary conditions @xcite which ensure that the mean slope is preserved . to every bond @xmath15 on the lattice",
    "is pre - assigned a fixed random number @xmath16 drawn from the interval [ 0,1 ] .",
    "the interface grows at that bond , in front of the interface , which carries the smallest random number .",
    "the local growth rules are the following ; if the chosen minimal bond has a positive ( negative ) slope , the sequence of links with negative ( positive ) slope just below ( on the left ) also advances , as illustrated in fig .",
    "this preserves the length of the interface as would happen in situations with very high surface tension .",
    "the local dynamics of interface adjustment is similar to that for the low - noise toom interface in  @xcite ; the models are different in that the growth site is picked by the extremal rule in our case , while it is picked stochastically in the toom interface model .",
    "the ebm differs from the sneppen model in that the length of the interface is a strict constant of the motion and the @xmath17 s are associated with bonds rather than sites .",
    "while this modification does not change the values of any of the large - distance scaling properties of the sneppen model , it has a few advantages .",
    "the interface aligns along directed spanning paths in a percolation problem , just as in the sneppen model . in our case , the corresponding percolation problem is the diode - resistor percolation problem  @xcite . on the square lattice , it is dual to the directed bond percolation problem  @xcite which is relatively well - studied .",
    "another advantage is that the problem of interface growth in the ebm is conceptually simplified by the existence of a known one - to - one correspondence between the growing interface and a system of hard - core particles moving on a ring .",
    "the two - dimensional problem hence reduces to an effectively one - dimensional one .",
    "this also facilitates the numerics .",
    "the correspondence between the interface and the hard - core particles is detailed below .",
    "positive slope links of the interface are represented by particles ( @xmath18 ) and negative - slope links by holes ( @xmath19 ) ; see fig .",
    "the difference in height of the interface between sites @xmath20 and @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 .",
    "in front of each link of the interface is a bond with a random number @xmath23 assigned to it .",
    "correspondingly , the site @xmath24 with the particle ( hole ) representing this link carries a random number @xmath25 . just as for the interface , at each time step , activity is initiated at the site with the minimum @xmath25 .",
    "the update rules for the interface translate to the following dynamics for particles and holes .",
    "if the site with minimum @xmath25 contains a particle ( hole ) , it exchanges with the first hole ( particle ) to the left ( right ) .",
    "all sites hopped over , including the two which exchange the particle and hole , are refreshed by assigning a new set of @xmath25 s .",
    "this corresponds to the fact that the updated portion of the interface moves ahead and meets a fresh set of @xmath23 s on the square lattice .",
    "because the number of positive slope links ( and hence also the number of negative slope links ) is conserved for the interface , in the particle - hole terminology , this implies that the number of particles is conserved .",
    "hence we can define a density @xmath26 for particles on the one - dimensional lattice .",
    "this density determines the mean slope @xmath27 of the interface .",
    "an untilted interface corresponds to half - filling .",
    "the reference direction for determining tilt is the easy direction of directed bond percolation on the square lattice , which is along the @xmath28 line .",
    "tilt refers to any density away from @xmath29 , which implies a slope different from @xmath28 .",
    "the interface advances in a direction perpendicular to the direction of tilt and this translates to a nonzero current of particles on the ring .",
    "extremal models of interface depinning make use of a correpondence to the diode resistor percolation ( drp ) and directed percolation ( dp ) problems to predict various properties of the interface . in view of this , it is useful to recall some facts about the dp and drp processes .    in the directed percolation problem ,",
    "bonds on a lattice are occupied with probability @xmath30 . at",
    "some critical value @xmath31 an infinite directed path of occupied bonds ( in which every step is taken rightward or upward ) first forms along a definite direction ; on a @xmath32 square lattice , this is along the @xmath28 direction . for @xmath33 ,",
    "the network of these infinite paths forms an infinite connected cluster . for directed bond percolation on a square lattice the value of @xmath31",
    "is known to be @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "there are two distinct correlation lengths , @xmath35 along the easy direction and @xmath36 transverse to it , both of which diverge as @xmath37 : @xmath38 respectively .",
    "the values of these exponents are known to be @xmath39 and @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "suppose we have a single source point , and we ask which portion of the plane can be reached from it via occupied directed bonds . for @xmath41 this region is contained within a cone with opening angle @xmath42 where @xmath10 is the slope of the edge of the cone with respect to the @xmath28 direction ; the opening angle depends on @xmath30 .",
    "this relation can be inverted to find the critical probability @xmath43 _ viz . _",
    "the probability at which a connection first appears along the direction with slope @xmath44 .",
    "correlation lengths along and perpendicular to this direction have exponents @xmath45 and @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "we refer to the direction along @xmath47 as untilted ( @xmath12 ) ; any other slope is referred to as tilted .    in the diode - resistor percolation problem",
    ", every bond is occupied by a `` diode '' ( a one - way connection ) with a probability @xmath48 or a `` resistor '' ( a two - way connection ) with a probability @xmath49 . on a square lattice ,",
    "the diodes all point up or right .",
    "let us ask which regions of the plane are connected to a given source point . if @xmath50 , a source point can reach the entire quadrant of which it is the left corner .",
    "as @xmath30 decreases from @xmath51 to @xmath31 , the opening angle @xmath52 of the connected region increases from @xmath53 to @xmath54 ; beyond this , the entire plane can be reached from the source point .",
    "the edge of the connected region is bordered by diodes pointing rightward and upward , which prevent it from spreading leftward and downward ( fig .",
    "4 ) .    on the @xmath32 square lattice ,",
    "dp and drp are dual to each other @xcite .",
    "the dual to a drp configuration is constructed using the following rules .",
    "a diode in the drp lattice is crossed by a diode in the dual lattice , whereas a resistor is crossed by an insulator ( no connection ) in the dual lattice .",
    "thus we recover the directed percolation problem on the dual lattice .",
    "the opening angle of the cones in the two problems are related by @xmath55 .    in the ebm",
    ", the random medium is modelled by considering a square lattice with every bond assigned a random number @xmath16 drawn from the interval @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "for a certain trial value @xmath57 , imagine occupying all bonds with @xmath58 by resistors , and the rest with diodes .",
    "we thereby generate a drp configuration with @xmath59 .",
    "when @xmath57 takes on the value @xmath60 , an infinite connected path of diodes is formed .",
    "such a path is called a ` stopper ' , and is significant for the dynamics of the ebm , as a moving interface with no overall tilt will align with such stoppers from time to time @xcite . when the interface aligns along a stopper ,",
    "all the bonds in front of it are larger than @xmath61 ( fig .",
    "5a ) . similarly a tilted interface with slope",
    "@xmath10 aligns along the edge of the cone with the same slope and all the bonds in front of it are expected to have a value larger than @xmath62 . since @xmath63 for @xmath64 , @xmath65 ( fig .",
    "even when the interface is evolving between two stoppers , only a small fraction of its overall length actually is in between ; the rest is still aligned with a stopper .",
    "the non - aligned fraction is expected to vanish in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "these expectations are confirmed by numerical studies of the ebm .",
    "as can be seen from the figures , the bonds in front of the interface are all mostly larger than a threshold value .",
    "consider an interface of slope @xmath10 aligned along a critical drp path of the same slope .",
    "it then moves forward by puncturing the path at the site with the least value of @xmath23 , which for an infinite system is exactly @xmath66 . on piercing through",
    ", a portion of the interface grows and fills out a loop of the infinite cluster while the rest of it remains pinned .",
    "however the interface motion within the loop is far from uniform .",
    "just as the critical cluster at @xmath43 impedes the growth of the interface on length scales of the order of the size of the system , near - critical clusters impede its motion at length scales of the order of but smaller than the loop size .",
    "one can think of these clusters as forming a finer network of connections within the network formed by the critical cluster at @xmath43 .",
    "while the interface is filling out a loop of the critical cluster , it encounters this finer mesh and as a result its motion is impeded temporarily . in what follows",
    ", we refer to these near - critical connections as ` sub - stoppers ' .",
    "a substopper can be characterized by the lowest value of @xmath16 on it , say @xmath67 , and also by the typical length scale @xmath68 over which it provides for effective pinning of the interface .",
    "these are related through @xmath69 .",
    "the above description of the evolution of the interface , contained as it is by networks of substoppers and stoppers , makes it clear that there are strong correlations between successive points of growth or forward motion .",
    "these correlations extend from small length scales up to scales of the order of the system size .",
    "figure 6 shows the plot of the location of the active site for 10,000 time steps for both the tilted and untilted cases .",
    "it can be seen that there are jumps on all scales in the active site position .",
    "the figure corroborates the description of interface motion given above .",
    "region ( 1 ) is a typical instance of the interface filling out a loop of size @xmath68 .",
    "it shows that there are jumps of all sizes upto a length @xmath68 , bearing out the substopper picture .",
    "region ( 2 ) on the other hand marks an instance when the interface has aligned along a stopper @xmath43 and hence there are jumps of all sizes upto the system size .",
    "more quantitatively , a measure of this long - ranged motion of the active site is the probability distribution @xmath70 that two consecutive locations of the active site are a distance @xmath68 apart .",
    "figure 7 shows @xmath70 for both the tilted and the untilted interface . in both cases , @xmath70 decays as a power for large @xmath68 : @xmath71 .    in the untilted ( @xmath72 ) case",
    ", @xmath70 is a purely symmetric function because of @xmath73 symmetry .",
    "we find @xmath74 , which compares well with earlier determined values of @xmath54 for the sneppen model @xcite .    in the tilted case ( @xmath75 ) ,",
    "@xmath76 is not a symmetric function ( fig .",
    "7 ) . as can be seen from the figure ,",
    "there is a larger number of small jumps to the right , but more jumps of large magnitude to the left .",
    "it is convenient to separately analyse the even and odd parts @xmath77 in order to find the exponents .",
    "we find that the even part , @xmath78 , decays asymptotically as @xmath79 with @xmath80 .",
    "the odd part @xmath81 changes sign ( as implied by the crossing of the curves in fig . 7 ) and asymptotically follows @xmath82 with @xmath83 .",
    "we verified that the values of @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the same for various @xmath75 .",
    "an interesting aspect of the function @xmath70 for the tilted interface is that @xmath86 vanishes in the thermodynamic limit . in terms of the active - site motion , this implies that though , for the tilted interface , the short - ranged jumps of the active site are mostly along the tilt , there are enough long - ranged jumps in the opposite direction to balance this .",
    "the cancellation gets better as the thermodynamic limit is approached .",
    "the tilt of the interface , therefore does not induce a net drift in the active site motion .    because of the close connection of the interface growth problem to dp , several exponents associated with the growth and structure of the interface are thought to be related to the dp exponents @xmath87 and @xmath88 by scaling relations @xcite",
    ". the exponent @xmath54 in the untilted interface as well as the exponent @xmath89 in the tilted case have been argued to be related to the dp exponents by the scaling relation @xmath90 @xcite . besides this , for the tilted case",
    ", the exponents can also be obtained exactly @xcite .    as mentioned earlier",
    ", the function @xmath70 does not contain all the information about the active - site motion .",
    "this is due to the presence of temporal correlations in the interface depinning model : the jump of the active site at the present instant is strongly correlated to the jumps before . as a result ,",
    "what is needed is the full distribtion function @xmath91 which is the conditional probability distribution that a jump of length @xmath68 occurs at @xmath92 given that a jump of length @xmath93 occurred at @xmath94 , a jump of length @xmath95 occured at @xmath96 and so on .",
    "the probability distribution @xmath70 is obtained by integrating out the other variables @xmath97 . in order to assess the importance of these temporal correlations , we numerically determined the conditional jump probability distribution @xmath98 , the conditional probabilty that a jump of length @xmath99 occurs given that at the previous instant , the active - spot jumped a distance @xmath68 .",
    "figure 8a presents our numerical measurement of this function for the ebm .",
    "after the initial short - ranged decay , which is a result of the local back - wetting move of the dynamics , the function is flat over a considerable range , and then decays as a power . as evident in the figure , the range of the flat region depends on @xmath68 but the value of the probability in the flat region becomes independent of @xmath68 for large @xmath68 . in figure 8b",
    "we show the scaling plot of @xmath98 obtained by plotting the curves as a function of @xmath100 .",
    "the function evidently approaches a scaling form for large @xmath68 and @xmath99 .",
    "the scaling function is flat over a region and decays beyond as a power @xmath101 .",
    "we expect @xmath102 to hold as @xmath103 .",
    "although the measured value of @xmath104 in the range shown is larger ( @xmath105 ) , the bending apparent in the lower right portion of the curve is consistent with an approach to the value @xmath54 .",
    "qualitatively , the behaviour of this function may be understood thus .",
    "if the active site jumps a distance @xmath68 at the previous instant , one can think of the interface as pinned by a dp cluster with loops of average linear dimension @xmath106 .",
    "most of the interface would then be pinned while a portion of it fills out a loop of linear dimension @xmath106 .",
    "this would imply that on an average , any jump smaller than @xmath68 is equally likely . on length scales larger than @xmath68",
    "the motion is like the original problem and hence the jump probability decays as a power .",
    "this line of argument would imply that @xmath98 should be a scaling function of @xmath107 .",
    "figure 8b bears out this expectation .",
    "another equivalent way of understanding the function @xmath98 is using the ` backward - avalanche ' technique introduced in  @xcite .",
    "a backward - avalanche is defined as follows .",
    "if at time @xmath108 a random number @xmath16 is picked as the minimum , the magnitude of the backward avalanche is @xmath109 if at time @xmath110 the random number picked was larger than @xmath16 but for time @xmath111 for @xmath112 the value of the random number picked was smaller .",
    "that is , one goes back in time to the first instant when the random number picked is larger than the present one and this interval of time is the magnitude of the backward - avalanche initiated at the present instant . if the active site hopped a distance @xmath68 in the previous instant , this would imply that the size of the spatial region affected by the backward avalanche initiated at the previous instant is @xmath106 . at the next time step any of three possibilities can occur .",
    "if the random number picked is _ smaller _ than the previous one , then the active site necessarily lies in the local region which has just been affected by the move .",
    "if the random number picked is larger , then either the random number picked belongs to the same backward - avalanche as the previous one , or it belongs to a bigger one ( which therefore encompasses the previous one ) .",
    "in the former case , the active site is equally likely to hop anywhere in the region affected by the present backward - avalanche (  @xcite ) and hence the function is flat upto a length @xmath106 . in the latter case ,",
    "active - site hops are in general larger , since the encompassing backward avalanche is larger .",
    "the probability of having the active site hop a distance @xmath113 is then related to the probability of finding a backward avalanche of this spatial extent , and hence decays as a power .",
    "another indication of the correlation in the jumps of the active site is the following quantity which is the analog of an avalanche , for jumps ( fig .",
    "let the avalanche be initiated at an instant @xmath110 by a jump of magnitude @xmath68 of the active spot .",
    "the `` jump - avalanche '' lasts as long as consecutive jumps in the active site are less than @xmath68 .",
    "that is , the avalanche is of duration @xmath109 if at time @xmath110 the active site hopped a length @xmath68 , and for @xmath109 consecutive instants after that , the hops in the active site are smaller than @xmath68 till at the @xmath114th instant , it hopped a distance greater than @xmath68 .",
    "the analog of this quantity for random numbers was first defined for models in the non - wetting invasion percolation regime @xcite and later also measured for the sneppen model @xcite .",
    "the jump - avalanche is a strong indication of the correlation in successive jumps of the active site . as fig .",
    "9 indicates , the function falls off as a slow power .",
    "this is an indication of the long - term memory in the system , as the function would decay exponentially if successive jumps had not been correlated .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the motion of the active spot in this model is very correlated .",
    "one can then ask whether this motion reorganizes the shape of the interface ( or equivalently the arrangements of particles and holes in the particle model corresponding to the ebm ) in any specific way . below we will show that the correlated motion of the growth - spot in this model leads to the formation of a pattern in height gradients ( or equivalently the density of particles ) of the interface .    the defining eq .",
    "[ eq : pattern ] for height gradients can be written in terms of densities as @xmath115 here @xmath116 is the density at site @xmath117 and the angular brackets denote a time average in the steady state .",
    "this pattern is linked to the formation of a structure which is very different from normal space - fixed patterns because it is referred to an origin @xmath118 which is moving around .",
    "in fact it can be discerned _ only _ when the origin moves .",
    "an ordinary space fixed average is translationally invariant and satisfies @xmath119 for any site @xmath117 .",
    "since the pattern is centered around the site of activity , we will refer to it as the `` activity - centered pattern '' ( acp ) .",
    "we studied @xmath11 by monte carlo simulation in the particle - hole representation .",
    "we studied systems of size @xmath3 ranging from @xmath120 to @xmath121 .",
    "the system was allowed to evolve through @xmath122 configurations before measurements were made . in order to speed up the algorithm to locate the site with the minimum @xmath23",
    ", we used a logarithmic - bin search procedure .",
    "steady state averages were computed using @xmath123 configurations .",
    "while this number of configurations was averaged over to get an accurate estimate of the decay exponent , even an average over about @xmath124 configurations indicates the presence of a strong density inhomogeneity clearly .    in the untilted case ,",

    "as discussed in the previous section , a pattern in height gradients or densities is formed in the interface depinning model .",
    "it is related to the motion of the active site which rearranges the particles and holes in its wake .",
    "for example , if the active site were to remain stationary at a given site for a certain length of time , the dynamics is such that it would build up a pile - up of particles to the left of the site and a pile - up of holes to the right _ i.e. _ it would create a density shock around itself . in this section , we write down an integral equation which provides a description of the pattern in terms of @xmath70 , the probability that the active site hops a length @xmath68 in consecutive instants , as well as the local dynamics of interface readjustment .",

    "the details of the analysis are given in section v b below .",

    "further , we can gain considerable insight into the mechanism of activity - centered pattern formation by studying the effect of different decays of the jump function @xmath70 within the lvy - flight model .",
    "the lvy - flight model is defined as follows .",
    "consider a one - dimensional lattice with particles and holes .",
    "we assume that a jump probability distribution @xmath70 is specified a priori : if at @xmath148 the active site is located at a site @xmath117 , at the next instant , it can lie a distance @xmath68 away ( _ i.e. _ at @xmath149 ) with a probability @xmath70 .",

    "the entries of this column vector are the probabilities @xmath158 for the configuration @xmath150 where @xmath159 . to obtain the steady state , we need to solve the master equation @xmath160 where @xmath2 is an @xmath161 matrix connecting the different states .",
    "the dynamics that connects different states is the following : the particle ( hole ) at @xmath153 is exchanged with the nearest hole ( particle ) to the left ( right ) as specified earlier .",

    "eventually , this leads to a total separation of particles and holes .",
    "this picture is modified only slightly when the active site executes a localised motion about any lattice site , and hence for a short - ranged @xmath70 ( fig .",

    "there is no @xmath208 term , as the elementary step of hopping a particle or hole conserves particle number , implying @xmath209 .",

    ", however , the numerically determined value of @xmath228 deviates substantially from the predicted value @xmath229 .",
    "the likely reason behind the discrepancy is explained in the next section .",
    "the integral equation ( 2 ) is exact for the lvy flight model , but only approximate for the ebm of interface depinning .",
    "here we briefly run over the nature of the approximations made , and possible directions for improvement .",
    "one sort of approximation is the neglect of correlations between lengths of successive jumps ; as we saw in section iii , these correlations are very marked .",
    "the extension of the integral equation to include such correlations is discussed in section vi b.    as noted in case 3 of section vb for tilted interfaces ( @xmath230 ) , the pattern is not well represented by eq .",
    "( 2 ) even qualitatively .",
    "the reason for this is that the @xmath231 pattern in the ebm is formed due to a feedback effect which is missing in the lvy flight model . if @xmath232 , then within ebm dynamics , particles ( or holes if @xmath233 ) are picked more often than just @xmath234 times in @xmath235 tries",
    "this condition is not incorporated in eq .",
    "[ eq : acp ] at all . to test",
    "how important this effect is , we simulated the lvy flight model with the further constraint that if a site chosen for growth does not contain a particle , it is discarded and the search is continued till a site containing a particle is found .",
    "this leads to a pattern that much more resembles that in the @xmath230 ebm , in that the even part of the pattern is much more prominent than the odd part ( see fig .",
    "another point to note is that we have always taken the density - increment function @xmath236 to be short - ranged .",
    "insofar as we are interested in the ebm , this is certainly so .",
    "however , in the lvy - flight model , any power larger than 3 , results in a pattern like the one shown in fig . 13 , with a segregation of particles and holes and not one decaying as a power as predicted by the integral equation .",
    "the reason for this is that in this case , the mean squared distance @xmath237 covered by the active site in time @xmath6 is finite .",
    "hence for a large system , this is like a short - ranged motion and leads to particle hole segregation . in the process ,",
    "as particle clusters build up , the density - increment function is no longer short - ranged .",
    "lastly , while in the ebm , the probability distribution of jumps @xmath70 arises naturally from the dynamics , in the lvy - flight model we put in the spatial correlation in the active site motion by hand . in the following section , we try and remedy this point by modifying the integral equation by writing a set of coupled equations .",
    "a drawback of the lvy flight model is that the function @xmath70 has to be supplied from the outside .",
    "we try to rectify this by writing a set of coupled equations that predict @xmath11 and @xmath238 in terms of each other .    in order to do this",
    ", we need to understand the probability that a certain portion of the pattern is visited by the active site . in the ebm ,",
    "the site visited last has the largest probability of being visited again since it is most likely to have the least random number .",
    "the more often a region is visited , the more the random numbers associated with sites in that region are refreshed and hence the more likely it is that the minimum random number lies in that region . since the dynamics creates a particle excess on the left of the active site and a corresponding paucity on its right , a density shock is built up in that region .",
    "the extent of the shock is directly proportional to the length of time spent by the active spot in that region .",
    "the larger the shock , the larger the density difference , and hence the larger the derivative of @xmath170 .",
    "hence the effect of a region being visited a large number of times is precisely that @xmath239 is large .",
    "but as explained above , the larger the number of times a site is visited , the larger is the probability of its being visited again .",
    "thus we conjecture that the probability of visiting a region a distance @xmath68 away from the active site is proportional to the magnitude of @xmath239 in that region , and write the following equations : @xmath240 \\ , \\label{eq : inteq1}\\ ] ] and @xmath241 where @xmath242 is the appropriate normalising factor .",
    "equation  [ eq : inteq1 ] is the integral equation that we derived in the last section .",
    "equation  [ eq : coeq ] now defines @xmath70 in terms of the pattern @xmath170 .",
    "the details of the dynamics of particle - hole exchange in this model make this a reasonable premise as explained above .",
    "let us compare the results of the coupled equations with those for the untilted interface .",
    "if @xmath243 and @xmath244 .",
    "further , eq .  [ eq : coeq ] predicts the relation @xmath245 .",
    "the solution is @xmath246 and @xmath247 .",
    "this compares quite well with the value of the exponents @xmath248 and @xmath249 found numerically for the ebm .",
    "the pattern , as defined earlier , is obtained by a straight time average over all configurations , taking care to shift the origin appropriately at every instant .",
    "it is interesting to ask how the pattern changes if we consider only those configurations that occur after very large jumps of the active site ( or equivalently , only those configurations for which the minimum random number is very close to the largest possible ) .",
    "a strong dependence of the pattern on the configurations averaged over is evident in fig .",
    "the pattern gets more squashed as the jumps in the active site leading to the configuration get larger .",
    "this implies that the pattern ceases to exist at stoppers and builds up again as the interface pierces through .",
    "the actual dynamics of pattern collapse and build - up is an interesting subject for further study .",
    "it should be recalled that long jumps occur much more infrequently than short jumps ( fig .",
    "7 ) ; the probability of occurrence of a stopper is thus very low .",
    "the time average in the definition of the pattern ( eq . [ eq : pattern ] ) is dominated by configurations between stoppers ( when the active site is moving within the loops of the directed percolation network ) , rather than those at stoppers ( when the active site is on the backbone of the network ) .      the integral equation 3 can be modified to include correlations in time . to do this",
    ", we enlarge the definition of a configuration @xmath150 to include the active site at the previous instant as well . now the off - diagonal elements of the transition matrix elements @xmath250 if configuration @xmath24 has resulted as a consequence of a jump of the active site of length @xmath68 and is connected to configuration @xmath150 by an elementary update and a jump of the active site of length @xmath99 .",

    "we avoided this problem by studying the fourier transforms of the functions , as the saturation value influences only the single fourier mode at @xmath295 . in all three cases ,",
    "the fourier transforms show evidence of power law behaviour as @xmath186 , implying power law approaches of the @xmath23-patterns to their respective saturation values in real space .",
    "however , we have not developed an analytical description of the @xmath23-patterns in any of these models .",
    "pattern formation thus seems to be generic to extremal models .",
    "however there are instances when considerations of symmetry rule out the formation of a pattern .",
    "this is exemplified in the following model , similar in spirit to that considered in  @xcite .",
    "the rules of the dynamics are the same as in the ebm , random numbers are assigned to every site and the minimum is picked , except that there is no net current of particles as there was in the ebm .",
    "if the site picked is occupied by a particle , the particle exchanges place with the first hole to its left , and if the site is occupied by a hole , the hole too exchanges place with the first particle to its left . at half",
    "filling , there is no net current .",
    "this model is the most symmetric of those considered so far and there is no density pattern formed .",
    "however , as in the bak - sneppen and the zaitsev models , there is a nontrivial pattern in random numbers in this model .",
    "we emphasize that the feature of the dynamics which is responsible for activity - centered pattern formation is the existence of correlations in the motion of the active site .",
    "extremal models constitute just one class in which there are such correlations .",
    "an example of another such class is models of certain types of reaction - diffusion systems , where the activity is quite constrained and correlated . in another physical context",
    ", it would seem that coherent structures which form in turbulent flows @xcite may well be described by activity - centered patterns . in our definition of the pattern ,",
    "we take an average over all times , keeping track of the moving structure .",
    "this is to be contrasted with previously used methods to identify such moving structures , based on the notion of conditional sampling , namely , averaging only over those time zones in which the activity is at a particular space - time location @xcite .",
    "our definition takes configurations at all times into account , but requires a shift of the origin at every instant .",
    "we have introduced a variant of the sneppen model of interface depinning  the extremal bond model  and have studied the effect of the dynamics of the growth process on the shape of the interface .",
    "our principal result is the observation that there is a nontrivial structure which forms in the interface , and which moves along with the active site .",
    "a simple time average of the height gradients , measured in a frame of reference which moves with the active site , defines the activity - centered pattern which serves to quantify the structure .",
    "our numerical study shows that the pattern has a tail which decays as a power law at large distances .",
    "an understanding of the mechanism underlying activity - centered pattern formation was obtained by writing an integral equation which relates the pattern to the probability distribution of active - site jump lengths .",
    "the integral equation could be derived by writing an extended master equation for the lvy flight model , making it clear that the equation is exact only when there are no temporal correlations between successive jump lengths . in the extremal bond model , however ,",
    "such correlations are strong .",
    "we have shown that a correct description of the pattern , involving temporal correlations , necessitates keeping an infinite hierarchy of equations . terminating this hierarchy at the very first step results in our integral equation .",
    "it would be of interest to understand how much one can better this description by keeping more steps in the hierarchy .",
    "the activity - centered pattern is a one - point function , and so enters the definition of two - point correlation functions .",
    "the physical point is that the density inhomogeneity caused by the pattern must be taken into account , by subtracting the relevant quantity from the density - density correlation function .",
    "if this is not done , and the square of the the nominal density @xmath138 is subtracted instead , the correlation function can exhibit a rather unusual sort of finite size effect .",
    "this is an interesting point since the space - fixed time - averaged density at a site is @xmath138 , and it is only the density as defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : pattern ] with respect to the moving active site which is different from the nominal density .",
    "yet the space - fixed two - point function is affected by this `` hidden '' pattern .",
    "the presence of the pattern clearly points to a non - homogeneity in the interface : the region around the active site looks very different on average from the region far away from it .",
    "for instance , we expect there to be a larger length of interface in a region of fixed size @xmath296 around the active site , than in a region opposite it .",
    "we monitored mean squared fluctuations of the height around the instantaneous average , in regions around and opposite the active site , and found a pronounced difference ( factor @xmath297 , for both tilted and untilted interfaces with @xmath298,@xmath299 ) .",
    "this effect is smaller at stoppers , in keeping with our finding that the pattern itself is suppressed there .",
    "this excess length of interface associated with the activity - centered pattern may provide a useful way to identify the active region in experiment .    finally , it was pointed out that activity - centered pattern formation may occur in a wide variety of other physical contexts , ranging from low - temperature creep of dislocations to structures in turbulent flows .",
    "we have presented numerical evidence for this sort of pattern formation in a number of other extremal models .",
    "but more generally we expect activity - centered patterns to form whenever there are strong correlations between successive locations of the active site",
