    "in the currently favored cosmological constant plus cold dark matter ( @xmath3cdm ) model of cosmology , structure forms hierarchically : small dark matter haloes collapse at high redshifts , while larger and more massive objects form through a series of minor mergers that accrete smaller mass haloes and major mergers with comparable mass haloes . since dark matter haloes provide the gravitational potential wells necessary for galaxy formation @xcite , a detailed understanding of the effects of mergers is necessary in order to test models of galaxy formation and evolution within the @xmath3cdm paradigm .",
    "recent numerical studies indicate that the hierarchical build - up process results in haloes with significant substructure populations : hundreds to thousands of subhaloes to the smallest resolvable mass scales appear to reside within galaxy sized haloes , comprising approximately 10% of a halo s mass @xcite .",
    "a number of recent papers have investigated the evolution and detailed properties of the substructure using both semi - analytic models and numerical simulations .",
    "depending on factors such as the relative mass , pericentric distance , and halo concentration , the orbits and masses of the subhaloes can be strongly affected by dynamical friction and tidal stripping ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "dense subhaloes that survive the tidal process can sink to the centre of the parent halo , impacting its inner structure ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to minor mergers , where large haloes swallow up smaller ones in a relatively gentle fashion , major mergers are more violent events involving systems of approximately equal mass that can be studied in detail with numerical simulations only .",
    "the interest in major mergers has a long history .",
    "@xcite noted that many observed features of galaxy pairs can be explained by tidal interactions that could promote merging .",
    "they further speculated that if such interactions were common enough , elliptical galaxies might naturally be explained as the merger remnants of spiral galaxies .",
    "this suggestion has led to numerous studies of galaxy merging and has been quite successful in helping explain the origin of ellipticals . in some of the earliest simulations",
    ", @xcite studied several types of mergers using 250 simulation particles per halo and concluded that products of mergers of cored galaxies were significantly more centrally concentrated than their progenitors , with more extended haloes having an approximate power - law density profiles @xmath4 that resembled the de vaucouleurs empirical profile for the surface - brightness of ellipticals @xcite .",
    "the higher resolution simulations by @xcite with @xmath5 particles per halo also exhibited the @xmath6 behavior with evidence for homology .",
    "simulations with multiple components representing dark matter haloes , stellar disks , and stellar bulges have been a source of much theoretical progress ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) and are essential for elucidating the dynamical coupling between the dark matter and stellar components in galaxies and for comparing simulation results with observations .",
    "pure dark halo simulations , however , are required for a controlled study of the non - baryonic dark matter that dominates the gravitational potential of seemingly all galactic systems .    in this paper",
    "we perform high - resolution @xmath0-body simulations of mergers of two equal - mass dark matter haloes and study how the phase - space distribution of dark matter particles is affected by such violent events and how the merger product relaxes into equilibrium .",
    "we pay particular attention to the central regions of the haloes and examine whether the initial inner structure of a dark matter halo , either with a flat core or a sharp cusp , is disrupted or preserved by major collisions .",
    "our study complements the numerous recent cosmological @xmath0-body studies of the properties and evolution of dark matter haloes , most of which have reached the somewhat surprising conclusion that over a wide range of mass scales , these haloes are universally cuspy and have radial density profiles with @xmath7 ( with @xmath8 ) in the central region and @xmath4 near the virial radius @xcite .",
    "the seemingly generic prediction of an inner cusp agrees with earlier simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) but is contrary to the inferred dark matter distribution in some dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies ( e.g. @xcite , though also see @xcite ) as well as in spiral galaxies @xcite and has lead to speculation that the @xmath3cdm model is in crisis .",
    "the simulations of major mergers performed in this paper provide a set of controlled experiments for us to address questions such as : how does the phase space density of dark matter haloes evolve and re - equilibrate during major mergers ?",
    "is the cuspy profile an attractor region of the phase space so that merger remnants of two non - cuspy ( i.e. cored ) haloes will end up cuspy",
    "? do cuspy haloes , once formed ( by any process ) , retain their inner structure after inevitable major mergers with other haloes ?",
    "unlike cosmological simulations that are designed to incorporate many complicated processes at once , the simulations performed here allow us to separate out the effects of minor mergers and to focus on how major collisions change the spatial and velocity structures of any initial haloes of our choice .",
    "additionally , cosmological parameters are unimportant for the simulations themselves since major mergers are local processes of two fully collapsed objects . in this case , all we need is the initial phase space distribution of each galaxy halo and the initial relative positions and velocities of the haloes themselves . by simulating collisions of two galaxy haloes with high spatial resolution and up to 5 million particles ( for each halo ) , we are able to follow their phase - space evolution and the density profiles of the remnants down to @xmath9 @xmath10 in our highest resolution simulation .",
    "section 2 of this paper describes the initial setup and the parameters used in the numerical simulations .",
    "we also discuss in some detail the tests performed to quantify the numerical effects of two - body relaxation on the central regions of the haloes and the technical issue of how to determine the centre of a merged halo .",
    "section 3 contains our results from the ten production runs for the energy , density profiles , velocity distributions , and phase space structure of merger remnants .",
    "section 4 discusses the energy distribution and the relaxation of a merged halo to an equilibrium state , with an emphasis on violent relaxation and phase mixing .",

    "the wave - like features in @xmath130 at 5 gyr are indications of shells of particles formed via phase - mixing @xcite .",
    "we note that unlike @xmath131 , which generally decreases with increasing @xmath50 , the shape of @xmath130 is skewed towards higher energies because of the density of states .",
    "both @xmath131 and @xmath130 have been studied analytically for isolated nfw @xcite and king haloes @xcite in equilibrium .",
    "the overall shape of @xmath130 resembles that shown in fig .",
    "[ ehist ] .",
    "we have simulated major mergers of galaxy haloes with both cuspy and cored inner density profiles using gadget , a versatile n - body tree code .",
    "our findings can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "mergers of two cored haloes of equal mass result in a cored halo .",
    "the core radius of the merged halo is nearly identical to those of the original haloes , but the core to virial radius ratio is reduced , with the outer density profile of the merger remnant well approximately by @xmath134 .",
    "this result also holds for mergers with parent halo mass ratios of 3:1 , implying all major mergers of two cored haloes result in cored haloes .",
    "mergers of a cuspy halo with either a cored halo or a second cuspy halo result in a cuspy halo .",
    "if the cuspy halo starts out with an nfw form , the merged halo also has an nfw - like form , with a slightly shallower inner cusp of @xmath135 instead of @xmath117 .",
    "3 .   the particles from a given halo retain memory of their progenitor s density profile . in major mergers of a cored halo with a cuspy halo , the particles originating from the cuspy halo end up with a cuspy profile , and those from the cored halo end up with a cored profile .",
    "( the cuspy particles dominate the total potential at the centre of the merged halo , so the resulting profile is cuspy . )",
    "the core particles in the inner 10 @xmath28 kpc of the remnant are significantly heated .",
    "the merger remnants relax from the inside outwards , attaining gaussian velocity distributions near their centres but not throughout the halo .",
    "violent relaxation due to time - varying potential is effective only during the initial phase of the mergers ; phase mixing is likely the dominant relaxation process at late times .",
    "5 .   including a moderate amount of orbital angular momentum in the form of a non - zero impact parameter has little discernible effect on our findings .",
    "the set of simulations presented in this paper has been performed for mergers of non - spinning haloes in a set bound orbit .",
    "this clearly only probes a restricted range of parameter space .",
    "a possible area for future investigations is to include non - zero initial spins , which can influence tidal interactions significantly but may only affect the final phase space structure weakly @xcite . we have also chosen not to convolute the issues in this paper by ignoring minor mergers with satellite haloes and continuous accretion of diffuse material .",
    "the latter mechanisms may be responsible for generating the first generation of cuspy haloes from initially cored haloes , a process not achieved by major mergers of cored haloes according to our study .    although the length and time scales quoted in this paper are for milky - way sized haloes of @xmath25 , there is nothing in the numerical code or in our analysis that is special to this particular mass scale ( except a mildly mass - dependent concentration parameter for nfw haloes ) .",
    "our conclusions in this paper are thus likely to be applicable to major mergers of comparable - mass haloes over a wide mass range .",
    "our finding that cuspy haloes are resilient to major mergers hints that the existence of cuspy haloes is natural in the hierarchical structure formation scenario : the build - up to larger mass haloes via repeated merging may be sufficient to produce cuspy haloes from cored haloes and preserve the general structure of cuspy haloes .",
