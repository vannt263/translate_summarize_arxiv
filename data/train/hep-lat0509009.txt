    "twisted mass fermions  @xcite at maximal twist  @xcite are presently under intensive study both with simulations and theoretical methods .",
    "the standard application involves two degenerate quarks , and this is the theory considered here .",
    "the long distance physics ( vacuum and pionic properties ) of twisted mass lattice qcd with two degenerate flavors ( tmlqcd ) can be studied using the methods of effective field theory , allowing a systematic dual expansion in the quark mass , @xmath2 , and the lattice spacing , @xmath3 , in which non - perturbative effects are parameterized by _ a priori _ unknown low energy constants ( lecs )  @xcite .",
    "the resulting theory is called twisted - mass chiral perturbation theory ( )  @xcite .",
    "its consequences in the vacuum and pionic sector have been worked out to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in the regime with @xmath4 ( the `` generic small mass '' or gsm regime , since the nlo expressions remain valid in this region , although the terms proportional to @xmath5 will become of nnlo . of course , for chiral perturbation theory to apply one must always have that @xmath6 . in practice , for present lattice spacings , this latter condition implies that @xmath2 does not exceed @xmath7 . ] )  @xcite , and at leading order ( lo ) in the regime with @xmath8 ( the `` aoki '' regime )  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath9 is a scale of the order of the qcd scale , @xmath10 .",
    "the present paper is a collection of observations that follow from  concerning discretization errors in tmlqcd . on the practical side ,",
    "i point out in sec .",
    "[ sec : maxtwist ] some new applications of results contained in ref .",
    "in particular , i describe how the observed difference between two methods of determining maximal twist that are being used in simulations can be understood using .",
    "this difference provides a direct measure of the size of discretization errors , or equivalently a measure of the lecs related to such errors .",
    "i also point out the relationship of these methods to a third ( theoretically interesting but apparently less practical ) method proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : fits ] i note that the dependence of physical quantities on the untwisted quark mass at fixed twisted quark mass gives another set of measures of the size of discretization errors , some of which are related by  at nlo .",
    "these results are contained in ref .",
    "@xcite , but have not been compared to the available numerical data , and i think it is useful to provide illustrative plots of the expected types of dependence .    when making these plots the question arises as to how to extend them into the aoki regime , which is the regime in which there are phase transitions caused by competition between quark mass effects and those due to discretization errors .",
    "previous studies , in refs .",
    "@xcite , worked to lo in this regime , and here i extend these results to nlo .",
    "this extension , described in sec .",
    "[ sec : aoki ] , turns out to require only one non - trivial additional low - energy coefficient .",
    "the results allow one to see how the phase transition lines , which are linear at lo , can become curved at nlo , and similarly how the lines of maximal twist using different definitions behave .",
    "these results may be amenable to numerical investigation , but , in any case , are of theoretical interest in understanding the relationship between different definitions of twist angle and critical mass .",
    "i also point out that , while a classical analysis is sufficient when working to nlo in the aoki regime , extension to next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) requires the inclusion of loop effects .",
    "my final topic , discussed in sec .  [ sec : ir ] , is the conclusions of ref .",
    "it is argued in @xcite that , if one makes an estimate of the critical mass that has an error of size @xmath7 , then , when working at maximal twist , physical correlation functions contain apparently infrared ( ir ) divergent discretization errors proportional to @xmath11 , with @xmath12 an integer .",
    "such errors , while consistent with automatic @xmath0 improvement , would restrict one to working with @xmath13 , and suggest a breakdown of the symanzik expansion  @xcite for smaller quark masses . it is then argued that , either by using an `` optimal '' choice of critical mass , or using a non - perturbatively improved quark action , these ir divergent errors at maximal twist can be reduced in size to @xmath14 . in this way",
    "the bound on the quark mass is reduced to @xmath15 , i.e. one can work in the gsm regime but not in the aoki regime .",
    "my observation is that the ir divergences are an indication of expanding around the wrong vacuum in the presence of large perturbation .",
    "using  one can sum these corrections to all orders and obtain a finite and smooth prediction for the dependence of physical quantities on the underlying untwisted and twisted quark masses .",
    "indeed , this is precisely what was done previously in refs .",
    "i argue further that there is no breakdown of the symanzik expansion , suitably interpreted , and no barrier to working at maximal twist in the aoki regime .",
    "these considerations do not , however , invalidate the conclusion of ref .  @xcite that one should use an appropriate `` optimal '' choice of critical mass to reduce the size of discretization errors .",
    "this was proposed previously using  in refs .",
    "@xcite , and the criteria for determining the optimal choice agree .",
    "my observation here is that , since  is built upon the symanzik expansion used by ref .",
    "@xcite , the result concerning optimal critical masses had to agree . in fact ,  goes beyond the symanzik expansion by adding non - perturbative information concerning spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the only additional assumption that one has to make is that the effective field theory framework is valid  @xcite .",
    "it is useful to keep in mind during the subsequent discussions the physical values of quark masses that correspond to the different regimes . if one takes @xmath16gev ( a relatively small lattice spacing for present dynamical simulations ) and @xmath17mev , then @xmath7 ( the size of quark masses in the gsm regime ) and @xmath18 ( the size in the aoki regime ) are about @xmath19 and @xmath20mev respectively .",
    "since we are interested in calculating with light quark masses varying from @xmath21mev down toward @xmath22mev , most simulations will be done in the gsm regime , with a significant tail entering the aoki regime .",
    "thus it is important to understand both regimes in detail .    in this paper",

    "the coefficient of the wilson term , @xmath27 , is typically set to unity in simulations ; the considerations that follow hold , however , for any @xmath28 choice of this coefficient .",
    "maximal twist is obtained by setting @xmath26 to an estimate of its critical value @xmath29 ( which , as will be seen , can depend on @xmath25 ) .",
    "the determination of @xmath29 is a key issue in tmlqcd , and the topic of much of the discussion which follows .",
    "i only note here that this is a non - trivial issue as no symmetry is restored when @xmath30 .",
    "by contrast , setting @xmath31 restores parity and flavor symmetries , and physical quantities are symmetrical under @xmath32 .",
    "i use the twisted basis , rather than the more continuum - like `` physical basis '' , used for example in ref .",
    "@xcite , since the twisted basis is that usually used in simulations , allowing a more direct connection to the numerical data .",

    "the accuracy with which @xmath29 must be determined in order to maintain automatic @xmath0 improvement depends on how close to the chiral limit one is working .",

    "@xcite , i refer to choices of critical mass which are accurate to @xmath42 as `` optimal '' , and denote them by @xmath43 ( and the resulting untwisted quark mass by @xmath44 ) .",

    "[ sec : maxtwist ] and [ sec : fits ]",
    ". one noteworthy choice of @xmath29 , which , as stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , is not optimal , is given by the position where the pion mass vanishes ( an end - point of the aoki phase , if present ) .",
    "this differs from optimal choices by @xmath41 . finally , if one works at nlo in the aoki regime , it is natural , as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : aoki ] , to incorporate an @xmath42 shift into @xmath29 .",
    "i denote the resulting critical mass and untwisted physical quark mass by @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively .",

    "the fact that only odd powers of @xmath3 appear has been noted also in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "so as not to clutter the notation with too many `` primes '' , i use the same ( unprimed ) symbol for @xmath2 in each regime , although it is defined using the untwisted quark mass appropriate to the given regime .",
    "thus , for example , in the aoki regime , @xmath48 .    the variables @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( or @xmath51 and @xmath52 , or @xmath44 and @xmath52 , etc .",

    ", @xmath2 is then the distance from the origin . once @xmath29 is estimated , one possible definition of the twist angle ( that which relates most directly to that used in the continuum ) is the angle relative to the positive untwisted mass axis .",
    "this angle depends on the choice of critical mass , but i refer to it as @xmath53 in all regimes .",
    "it is most useful in the gsm regime , where it is defined by @xmath54 in the aoki regime , at nlo , one replaces @xmath44 with @xmath46 .",

    "this section concerns the relation between two methods being used in present simulations [ which i refer to as methods ( i ) and ( ii ) ] and their relationship to a third method [ method ( iii ) ] proposed in ref .",

    "i assume that the quark masses are in the gsm regime .",
    "my observations are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : maxtwist ] .",
    "the line in the mass - plane defined by method ( i ) ( in which the pcac mass is set to zero ) makes an angle @xmath79 to the twisted mass direction [ and thus , by construction , to the line defined by method ( ii ) ] .",
    "this angle is proportional to the lattice spacing , and to one combination of the lecs describing discretization errors .",
    "it can be determined from present simulations , and the results show that this discretization error is not as small as one might hope , since it is determined by a scale @xmath80 gev rather than by @xmath81 .",
    "i also observe , following ref .",
    "@xcite , that method ( iii ) , previously argued to be difficult to implement in practice , is actually equivalent to method ( ii ) in the gsm regime ( and thus has already been used ) .    both method ( i ) and ( ii )",
    "are based on the continuum result that , at maximal twist , charged axial currents in the twisted basis correspond to physical vector currents , and thus should have vanishing coupling to physical charged pions .",
    "it is useful to introduce a definition of twist angle incorporating this result : @xmath82 where the currents are in the twisted basis , and the superscripts are adjoint @xmath83 indices .",
    "this angle is denoted @xmath84 in ref .",
    "@xcite , but i add the subscript `` a '' here for clarity .",
    "maximal twist can then be defined by @xmath85 , corresponding to  @xcite @xmath86 note that the charged pions can be unambiguously created by the local pseudoscalar density ( which is invariant under the axial transformation that rotates between twisted and physical bases ) .",
    "the condition ( [ eq : pcaccond ] ) is equivalent to setting the pcac mass ( defined in sec .",
    "[ sec : fits ] below ) to zero .",
    "the two methods apply the condition ( [ eq : pcaccond ] ) in different ways . in method ( i )",
    "the condition is enforced for each choice of @xmath25 by varying @xmath26",
    "this leads to a curve in the mass plane which one follows as @xmath25 is reduced . to good approximation this curve is found to be a straight line for the masses used in present simulations  @xcite .",
    "this method is sometimes called the parity - conservation definition , but i do not use this name as parity is not restored along the line it defines at non - zero lattice spacing [ and the name could equally well be applied to method ( iii ) discussed below ] . method ( ii ) defines the critical mass by extrapolating the curve along which the condition ( [ eq : pcaccond ] ) holds to @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "the resulting simulations are then done holding @xmath26 fixed at this value , with @xmath25 varying .",

    "[ fig : maxtwist ] , and in the second figure the vertical axis is @xmath87 rather than @xmath88 . )",
    "these are results from quenched simulations , but i will not rely on the details of these results , instead assuming only that the following features are general and continue to hold in unquenched simulations : ( 1 ) the curves are almost linear for small @xmath52 ( roughly for @xmath89mev ) ; and ( 2 ) they approach the @xmath31 axis at an angle that differs from @xmath90 .",
    "indeed this difference ( denoted by @xmath91 in fig .  [ fig : maxtwist ] ) is significant : approximately @xmath92 radians for @xmath93  @xcite , @xmath94 for @xmath95 and @xmath96 for @xmath97  @xcite .",

    "the most noteworthy feature of eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltaomega ] ) is that the effect is linear in @xmath3 .",
    "the angle @xmath79 is an example of a quantity which is not automatically improved at maximal twist ( as discussed more extensively in ref .",
    "the result ( [ eq : deltaomega ] ) also incorporates the result that using different lattice axial currents in the criterion ( [ eq : pcaccond ] ) leads to different results for @xmath79 .",
    "for example , using an improved current with @xmath105 instead of an unimproved current can be seen to lead to a change in @xmath79 proportional to @xmath106 .",
    "this effect enters through the dependence of @xmath76 on the lec @xmath72 , for @xmath72 itself depends on the choice of current .",
    "note that if one uses non - perturbatively improved wilson fermions ( which sets @xmath107 as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and a non - perturbatively improved axial current ( which sets @xmath108 ) , then @xmath79 is predicted to vanish at @xmath0 . in this case",
    "the difference between methods ( i ) and ( ii ) appears at next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) in , arising , for example , from a contribution proportional to @xmath109 in the symanzik effective action .",
    "this latter term gives the critical mass a quadratic dependence on @xmath110 .",
    "the resulting small curvature can in fact be seen in the quenched results discussed above , particularly in the results at the largest lattice spacing  @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that a non - zero value for @xmath79 does not contradict automatic improvement as long as it is of @xmath0 .",
    "contributions to physical quantities linear in @xmath3 are necessarily also proportional to @xmath79 , so the overall discretization error remains of @xmath41 .",
    "indeed , as stressed in refs .",
    "@xcite , there is an intrinsic , irreducible ambiguity in the twist angle : different criteria , equally good in the continuum limit , lead to results differing at @xmath0 at non - vanishing lattice spacing .",
    "in fact , one can define maximal twist as lying along any line in the mass plane whose angle satisfies @xmath111 , where the @xmath0 offset is arbitrary .",
    "note that for all such lines the quark mass is @xmath112 $ ] , and thus , to nlo accuracy , one can use @xmath113 .",
    "the above - mentioned curvature in the maximal twist line of method ( i ) allows one to estimate the size of the ambiguity in the resulting critical mass .",
    "the nnlo curvature means that , when extrapolating to @xmath114 from @xmath115 , the angle @xmath91 has an error of @xmath41 .",
    "this leads to an error in the intercept @xmath43 of size @xmath42 , consistent with the size predicted by  and noted in the introduction .    for practical applications it is important to study @xmath79 as an indicator of the size of discretization errors .",
    "one expects @xmath116 , with @xmath9 a scale lying somewhere in the range from @xmath117mev to @xmath118gev . for the @xmath97 results of ref .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath119 at @xmath120gev ) one finds @xmath121gev ( assuming @xmath122 ) .",
    "the results at the other lattice spacings are roughly consistent with this scale , or , to put it another way , are roughly consistent with the expected linear dependence on @xmath3 .",
    "one should not expect more than a rough consistency because there is additional implicit logarithmic dependence on @xmath3 , entering , for example , through the factor @xmath123 , as well as nnlo terms of @xmath41 .",
    "given the result for @xmath79 , one can very roughly estimate the size expected for the @xmath41 errors in physical quantities ",
    "they should be approximately be of relative size @xmath124 .",

    "nevertheless , if one uses it as a guide , one expects @xmath41 errors of relative size @xmath125 for @xmath120gev . and @xmath126 .",
    "for the pion mass - squared , and in particular for the minimum value of the charged pion mass - squared in the case of the first - order transition scenario , or the splitting between charged and neutral pion mass - squareds , the @xmath41 effects are additive , and of size @xmath127 . ]",
    "it should be borne in mind , however , that changes to the gluon and fermion actions , as well as changing from quenched to unquenched simulations , will change the size of the lecs and thus the discretization errors .",

    "@xcite with @xmath128 that the figure is symmetric under reflection in the @xmath26 axis .",

    "( 98 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) is that at maximum twist [ defined using any of methods ( i - iii ) ] @xmath136 in other words , up to nnlo corrections , methods ( ii ) and ( iii ) are the same .",

    "the generalization of this result to the aoki regime is discussed below .",
    "in this short section i point out that existing simulation data exhibit qualitative features predicted by , and that by doing more detailed fits one could over - determine the lecs associated with discretization errors .",
    "i illustrate these points by showing plots of physical quantities for a choice of lecs roughly consistent with the numerical results of ref .",

    "i work in the gsm regime , although the plots extend into the aoki regime , and use results from the following section .",

    "@xcite , it does not effect physical quantities , but can lead to a sign change in certain correlation functions .",
    "the net result is that for physical quantities one cancels @xmath0 errors by averaging over @xmath137 and @xmath143 with relative positive signs , while for other quantities one must determine the relative sign of the two terms on a case - by - case basis .",

    "there is , in other words , no breakdown of theoretical understanding in this region , and in particular no breakdown of the symanzik expansion , in the sense that once one includes the leading effects of @xmath357 non - perturbatively , the subleading contributions from these operators , and the contributions of higher order operators ( including now @xmath340 ) , are systematically suppressed by the expected powers of @xmath358 . in fact , if one works at maximal twist , defined using any of methods ( i - iii ) ( with the caveat that one must stay above the end - point in the first - order scenario ) , then the contributions of @xmath357 remain perturbative also , along with their manifest powers of @xmath3 .",
    "this is because , when using any of these methods , the condensate points in direction of maximal twist up to small corrections , @xmath416 .",
    "second , although the apparent ir divergences are summed up by , their `` residue '' is a complicated dependence of physical quantities on @xmath3 and @xmath52 .",
    "third , and most important from a practical point of view , if one works at maximal twist using any of methods ( i - iii ) , then the continuum extrapolations are _ not complicated_. indeed , as already noted in the previous section , there are no @xmath5 ( or @xmath189 ) corrections to the charged pion masses in this case .",
    "thus in the aoki - phase scenario , there is no obstacle to working all the way down to @xmath114 , although in the first - order scenario one must stop at @xmath417 . nevertheless , the overall point is that one does not need to impose the constraint @xmath418  @xcite .",
    "there is an exception to the claim that  controls the ir divergences .",
    "this is in the vicinity of the end - points of the phase - boundary . here ,",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the power counting of  breaks down , and higher order terms , including loops , are needed to determine the vacuum .",
    "thus , in the first order scenario , one should work at maximal twist only until one is a distance @xmath419 away from the transition .",
    "the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite points out that , in addition to the leading order ir divergences , there are subleading ir divergent contributions .",
    "although the former have been understood and summed using , what of the latter ?",
    "i have not done a complete analysis of this question , but i think the above analysis of the leading divergences makes the following conjecture reasonable : the subleading ir divergences are removed by a small shift in the vacuum , perturbatively calculable in  ( except near the end - points ) .",

    "thus it is based on a tower of two local effective theories : the first describing the long - distance physics of lattice qcd , and the second describing the long - distance behavior of the first .",
    "the theoretical status of the second effective theory , i.e. chiral perturbation theory , is , perhaps , less solid than the first , since one can not do a perturbative analysis following symanzik  @xcite as chiral symmetry breaking is a non - perturbative phenomenon .",
    "nevertheless , the theoretical basis for , which is identical to that for continuum @xmath421pt , is strong  @xcite .",

    "the present analysis and the conjecture made above are important , because they imply that there is no non - uniformity in a joint expansion in @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the absence of ir divergent terms implies that one makes only small errors by truncating the symanzik expansion at , say , @xmath348 ( as is done in the previous section ) .",
    "studies of tmlqcd are still at a relatively early stage , and it is important to fully understand the practical and theoretical issues that are involved .",
    "key issues are the determination of the critical mass and the size , and chiral behavior , of the remaining discretization errors .",
    "particularly important discretization errors are those giving rise to parity and flavor breaking , for unless these are small in practice they will likely lead to complications in extracting phenomenologically important hadronic quantities .    here",
    "i have focused on the theoretical issues , showing how by applying chiral perturbation theory to symanzik s effective lagrangian one can systematically study the properties of discretization errors .",
    "the aim here is to understand the errors so that they can be removed , or reduced , in a controlled way .",
    "for example , if one wants to work at maximal twist , where the errors of @xmath0 are automatically removed , then it is useful to know what happens when the choice of critical mass has errors of a given size .",

    "@xcite and generalized here provide such information to nlo in the joint chiral - continuum expansion .",

    ", there is general agreement in the literature on how to proceed : one should use one of the `` optimal '' non - perturbative definitions of maximal twist [ methods ( i ) , ( ii ) or ( iii ) ] . here",
    "i have clarified the relation between the different definitions , both in the gsm and aoki regimes .",
    "there is however , disagreement on the interpretation of what happens to discretization errors as one approaches the chiral limit . with non - optimal choices of the critical mass ( including the `` @xmath404 '' definition irrespective of the accuracy of the extrapolation ) the results for a number of physical quantities exhibit a  bending \" effect , in which the results diverge away from the expected chiral behavior for @xmath422 .",
    "these can be understood qualitatively in  as a result of working at a non - maximal twist angle , with the divergence from @xmath90 increasing toward the chiral limit  @xcite .",
    "examples of the expected forms are given in figs .",
    "[ fig : ir ] and [ fig : iraoki ] .",
    "a seemingly different interpretation has been given in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the bending is due to discretization errors which are proportional to inverse powers of the quark mass , and which , for @xmath423 , arise from contributions proportional to all powers of @xmath3 .",
    "i have shown , however , that the interpretations are consistent : the apparently ir divergent errors of ref .",
    "@xcite are simply an expansion of the convergent expressions of , and indicate the need to do a non - perturbative shift in the vacuum .",
    "a similar discussion applies to the discretization errors that arise when one works with an optimal choice of maximal twist .",
    "the ir divergent errors analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite are summed up by  applied in the aoki regime .",
    "one consequence is that there is no barrier to working at maximal twist in this regime , i.e. with @xmath424 , as long as one uses the optimal choice of maximal twist determined in this regime ( rather than by extrapolation from larger masses ) and as long as one does not work all the way down to the second - order end - points if one is in the scenario with a first - order transition .",
    "it is suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite that the apparent ir divergences signal a breakdown of the symanzik expansion at small quark masses ( @xmath192 for an optimal choice of maximal twist ) .",
    "i have argued that this is not the case , although the situation is somewhat subtle .",
    "the apparent ir divergences are an indication that , in general , the leading terms in the symanzik expansion ( those proportional to @xmath3 and @xmath5 ) must be treated non - perturbatively , and this is what is accomplished by .",
    "this might be interpreted as a breakdown in the simple expansion in powers of lattice spacing , since insertions of any number of factors of @xmath340 and @xmath357 are required . on the other hand",
    ", one can treat subsequent terms , @xmath348 , @xmath420 , etc .",
    ", as small corrections , so in this sense the expansion remains intact .",
    "in fact , at maximal twist , defined optimally , the contributions of @xmath340 and @xmath357 can also be treated perturbatively , so the symanzik expansion remains valid in the usual sense that all powers of @xmath3 are manifest .",
    "it is for this reason that automatic improvement at maximal twist remains valid into the aoki region ( and all the way down to @xmath425 in the aoki - phase scenario  @xcite ) .",
