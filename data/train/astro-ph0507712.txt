    "high energy neutrinos are likely produced in many violent processes in the universe .",
    "their detection would unambiguously reveal the hadronic nature of the underlying processes .",
    "neutrinos would be generated by proton - proton or proton - photon interactions followed by production and decay of charged mesons .",
    "a description of the baikal - detector as well as physics results from data collected in the years 1998 - 2000 have been presented elsewhere @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present new results of a search for diffuse neutrinos with energies larger than 10 tev .",
    "the analysis is based on data taken with the baikal neutrino telescope _",
    "nt200 _ in the years 1998 - 2002 . instead of focusing to particles crossing the array ,",
    "the analysis is tailored to signatures of isolated high - energy cascades in a large volume around the detector .",
    "this search strategy dramatically enhances the sensitivity of _",
    "nt200 _ to diffuse high energy processes .    the cascades can stem from leptons and hadrons produced in high energy charged current processes .",
    "obviously , the energy released by the hadronic cascade in nc - reactions is small compared to that of the leptonic cascades in cc - reactions . since only electrons and taus develop cascades ( the one by directly showering up , the other via its decay to secondary particles which develop a cascade ) , the sensitivity of this search is dominated by @xmath10 and @xmath11 detection .",
    "within the 1038 days of the detector live time between april 1998 and february 2003 , @xmath12 events with @xmath13 have been recorded . for this analysis we used 22597 events with hit channel multiplicity @xmath1415 which obey the condition :",
    "@xmath15 here , @xmath16 are the arrival times at channels @xmath17 and the numbering of channels rises from top to bottom along the string .",
    "figure [ fig11 ] shows the @xmath18 and @xmath19 distributions for experiment ( dots ) and background simulation ( histograms ) .",
    "the distribution of experimental events is consistent with the background simulation .",
    "no statistically significant excess above the background from atmospheric muons has been observed .      with no experimental events outside the area populated by background events in the ( @xmath20)-parameter space ,",
    "we derive upper limits on the fluxes of high energy neutrinos as predicted by different models of neutrino sources .",
    "the detection volume @xmath21 averaged over all neutrino arrival directions , rises from @xmath2210@xmath23 m@xmath24 for 10 tev up to ( 4 - 6)@xmath610@xmath25 m@xmath24 for @xmath26 tev and significantly exceeds the geometrical volume @xmath27 10@xmath23 m@xmath24 of _ nt200_. this is due to the low light scattering and the nearly not dispersed light fronts from cherenkov waves originating far outside the geometrical volume .",
    "since no event has been observed which fulfills the selection conditions , upper limits on the diffuse flux of extraterrestrial neutrinos are calculated . for a 90% confidence level an upper limit , @xmath282.5 , on the number of signal events",
    "is obtained according to conrad et al .",
    "@xcite with the unified feldman - cousins ordering @xcite .",
    "we assume an uncertainty in signal detection of 24% and a background of zero events ( which leads to a conservative estimation of @xmath29 according to the feldman - cousins approach ) . if the expected numbers of signal events @xmath30 is larger than @xmath29 , the model is ruled out at 90% cl .",
    "table [ tab5 ] represents event rates and model rejection factors ( mrf ) @xmath31 for models of astrophysical neutrino sources obtained from our search .",
    "recently , similar results have been presented by the amanda collaboration @xcite .",
    "model rejection factors obtained by amanda are also shown in table [ tab5 ] .",
    "the models by stecker and salamon @xcite labeled `` ss q '' , as well as the models by szabo and protheroe @xcite `` sp u '' and `` sp l '' represent models for neutrino production in the central region of active galactic nuclei and are ruled out with @xmath32 0.06 - 0.4 . further shown are models for neutrino production in agn jets : calculations by protheroe @xcite , by mannheim @xcite , by mannheim , protheroe and rachen @xcite ( model `` mpr '' ) and by semikoz and sigl @xcite `` sesi '' . the latter models for blazars are currently not excluded . for an @xmath1 behaviour of the neutrino spectrum and a flavor ratio @xmath33 , the 90% c.l .",
    "upper limit on the neutrino flux of all flavors obtained with the baikal neutrino telescope _ nt200 _ ( 1038 days ) is : @xmath34 assuming an upper limit on the number of signal events @xmath282.5 , the model - independent limit on @xmath35 at the w - resonance energy is : @xmath36      figure [ fig16 ] ( left panel ) shows our upper limit on the ( @xmath37 ) @xmath1 diffuse flux as well as the model independent limit on the resonant @xmath4 flux ( diamond ) .",
    "also shown are the limits obtained by amanda and macro @xcite , theoretical bounds obtained by berezinsky ( model independent ( b ) and for an @xmath1 shape of the neutrino spectrum ( b(@xmath1 ) ) @xcite , by waxman and bahcall ( wb ) @xcite , by mannheim et al.(mpr ) @xcite , predictions for neutrino fluxes from topological defects ( td ) @xcite , prediction on diffuse flux from agns according to nellen et al .",

    "[ fig16 ] . in march / april 2005",
    "we fenced a large part of the search volume with three sparsely instrumented strings ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the three - year sensitivity of this enlarged detector _ nt200_@xmath38 , with about 5 mton enclosed volume , is approximately @xmath39@xmath8s@xmath9sr@xmath9gev for @xmath4010@xmath41 tev , i.e. three - four times better than _ nt200_. _ nt200_@xmath38 will search for neutrinos from agns , grbs and other extraterrestrial sources , neutrinos from cosmic ray interactions in the galaxy as well as high energy atmospheric muons with @xmath42 tev .",
