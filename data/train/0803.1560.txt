    "<S> since @xmath232 varies with temperature the material crosses over from type - i to type - ii as the temperature is lowered .    </S>",
    "<S> we have seen that measurements of thermodynamic properties have evolved into a major experimental tool in the quest for an understanding of type - ii superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> noting that the influence of magnetic fields on the superconducting state is of high technological relevance this issue is not of fundamental interest only . nevertheless , the effects of thermal fluctuations were not fully identified over several decades . </S>",
    "<S> particularly in classical superconductors , including nb@xmath11zr@xmath12 , nb@xmath8sn and nbse@xmath5 , interpretations based on the standard mean - field approximation were considered to be satisfactory . by contrast , our analysis of the specific heat data uncovered in sufficiently high fields remarkable consistency with the magnetic field induced finite size effect , giving rise to a 3d to 1d crossover which enhances thermal fluctuations . while in yba@xmath5cu@xmath6o@xmath7 , ndba@xmath5cu@xmath8o@xmath9 , yba@xmath5cu@xmath8o@xmath9 , and dyba@xmath5cu@xmath8o@xmath9  3d - xy- , in rbos@xmath5o@xmath10 inverted 3d - xy - thermal fluctuations were shown to drive this crossover , the specific heat data of the conventional type - ii superconductors nb@xmath11zr@xmath12 , nb@xmath8sn and nbse@xmath5 point to gaussian fluctuations . in any case , whenever this crossover occurs there is no continuous phase transition in the @xmath20 -plane along a @xmath17-line , as predicted by the mean - field treatment . instead there is the 3d to 1d crossover line @xmath305 with @xmath306 and @xmath307 denoting the critical amplitude of the correlation length below @xmath13 with critical exponent @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , below @xmath13 and above @xmath308 superconductivity is confined to cylinders with diameter @xmath309 whereupon the system becomes 1d . </S>",
    "<S> however , 1d systems with short range interactions do not undergo a continuous phase transition at finite temperature @xcite and with that there is no continuous phase transition in the @xmath20-plane above the 3d to 1d crossover line . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we have shown that the thermodynamic vortex melting transition occurs in the 3d regime . </S>",
    "<S> while in yba@xmath5cu@xmath6o@xmath7 , ndba@xmath5cu@xmath8o@xmath9 , yba@xmath5cu@xmath8o@xmath9 , and dyba@xmath5cu@xmath8o@xmath9  it is driven by 3d - xy thermal fluctuations , the specific heat data of the conventional type - ii superconductors nb@xmath11zr@xmath12 , nb@xmath8sn and nbse@xmath5 point to gaussian fluctuations . in any case , because the vortex melting transition and the 3d-1d crossover occur at universal values of the scaling variable @xmath50 , the ratio @xmath310 should be universal as well . </S>",

    "<S> thus it appears that thermal fluctuations , enhanced by the 3d to 1d crossover , are important not only in high - temperature superconductors but also in conventional type - ii superconductors with comparatively large correlation volume . </S>",
    "<S> this observation opens up a window onto the universal properties mediated by thermal fluctuations . and allows to probe the thermodynamic relevant spatial extent of the homogenous domains . </S>",
    "<S> from this perspective , more extended high resolution specific heat and reversible magnetization measurements on type - ii superconductors and their analyzes along the lines outlined here will certainly be necessary to unravel the details of the universal properties associated with the 3d to 1d crossover and the vortex melting transition in type ii superconductors .    over the years , we have benefited from numerous scientific discussions on this topic with h. keller , r. khasanov , r. lortz , c. meingast , k. a. mller , j. roos , j. m. singer , and s. weyeneth . moreover , </S>",
