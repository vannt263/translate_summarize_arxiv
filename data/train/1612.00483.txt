    "the inner few hundred pc of the galactic center differs from the rest of the galaxy in its ism properties .",
    "this region is occupied by a large concentration of warm molecular gas with high column density , high velocity dispersion , high gas temperature and high cosmic ray flux @xcite .",
    "what is unusual about this region is that the gas characteristics resemble those of star forming molecular cores and yet few sites of star formation are recognized in the inner degree of the galactic center .",
    "to investigate the origin of hot molecular gas , we surveyed the galactic center region using the 36.2 ghz methanol line emission .",
    "the 36.2 ghz methanol maser is generally associated with collisionally excited outflow sources ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eg ) .     the lower resolution c configuration survey of the region @xmath7 and @xmath8 by yusef - zadeh et al . ( 2013 ) with the very large array found 356 methanol maser candidates at 36 ghz with a spatial and spectral resolutions of 1.8@xmath9 and 16.6 km s@xmath4 , respectively , with rms noise @xmath1025 mjy beam@xmath4 @xcite",
    "these maser candidates were identified as part of continuum observations using the ka band at 35 ghz .",
    "this maser transition was imaged using 41 channels of continuum data .",
    "the source list was divided into strong and weak maser candidates with line fluxes greater than or less than 10 jy km s@xmath4 ( @xmath11446k for unresolved sources ) , respectively .",
    "this threshold was selected because the gas temperature of molecular clouds in the galactic center is less than 446k , thus many methanol sources may be tracing thermal emission with broad line - widths .",
    "we report the presence of 2240 methanol and 47 oh masers distributed toward the region surveyed by yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "the high abundance of methanol traced by quasi - thermal and maser emission is unlikely to be produced by gas - phase reactions , thus a different heating mechanism involving grain - surface chemistry is needed to evaporate methanol from dust grains @xcite .",
    "one possibility for the source of heating dust grains in the central molecular zone ( cmz ) of the galactic center is the interaction of cosmic rays and molecular clouds @xcite . in this picture , the abundance of methanol can be enhanced by induced photodesorption by cosmic rays as they travel through a molecular core @xcite .",
    "another byproduct of such an interaction is the increase in the abundance of oh , also known to be collisionally pumped and are produced at the interaction site when a supernova shock runs into a molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "one of the signature of collisional pumping is that only the oh(1720 mhz ) line is a maser whereas 1665/1665 , 1612 mhz emission are thermal and are generally detected in absorption ( see hewitt et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and references therein ) .",
    "the present work presents the methanol and oh data from this survey and future publications will explore the correlation of methanol masers with other probes of star formation activity such as radiatively excited methanol and water masers in detail .",
    "the maser observations were centered on the rest frequency of the collisionally excited class i methanol @xmath0 masers ( adopted rest frequency 36.169265 ghz ) .",
    "this sub - band had 1024 @xmath2 62.5 khz channels giving a velocity resolution of @xmath10 1.0 km @xmath12 after hanning smoothing .",
    "the observations also contained eleven 128 mhz sub - bands with 2 mhz resolution between 35.3 and 36.5 ghz for continuum calibration .",
    "the region of galactic longitude -0.6@xmath13 to + 0.5@xmath13 and galactic latitude -0.1@xmath13 to + 0.1 @xmath13 was covered in 900 pointings .",
    "these observations were made in five sessions between 2014 may 2 and 2014 may 22 .",
    "each session included a 19 @xmath2 19 pointing hexagonal grid with 0.65@xmath14 separation of the centers ; the antenna fwhm is 1.25@xmath1 .",
    "the rasters were parallel to the galactic plane .",
    "each pointing was allocated 40 seconds of which 32 were typically on source integrations .",
    "every 5th observation was of the phase reference calibrator , j1744 - 3116 , with pointing offsets measured hourly .",
    "3c286 was used as the primary flux and band - pass calibrator .",
    "we did not apply doppler corrections during our observations .",
    "the array was in the `` a '' configuration giving a maximum baseline of 35 km ; due to the southern declination of the target fields , the synthesized beam is elongated north  south , typically 0.14@xmath15",
    "@xmath2 0.05@xmath15 .",
    "antennas detected right and left  hand circular polarization and all four correlation products were recorded .",
    "the 36 ghz pointing centers and half power radius is shown in figure [ kapointfig ] .",
    "calibration and imaging used the obit package @xcitebcotton / obit.html ] .",
    "calibration and editing was done on each session independently and consisted of the following steps :    1 .",
    "the correlated data were only crudely calibrated in group delay leaving strong derivatives of phase with frequency .",
    "residual group delay offsets were determined from the continuum observations of 3c286 and j1744 - 3116 and applied to all data .",
    "residual variation of gain and phase with frequency was corrected by band - pass calibration using 3c286 .",
    "flux density calibration was based on a standard spectrum of 3c286 which was used to determine the spectrum of the astrometric calibrator , j1744 - 3116 .",
    "observations of j1744 - 3116 were then used to calibrate the amplitudes and phases of all data .",
    "the spectroscopic data also had the following corrections :    1 .",
    "doppler corrections for the earth s motion were applied for each pointing .",
    "data were hanning smoothed to reduce the gibbs ringing of the stronger masers .",
    "all data - sets were then subjected to a baseline dependent time averaging to reduce the data volume .",
    "this averaging was subject to the constraint that the amplitudes were reduced by no more than 1% to a radius of 0.6@xmath1 and averaging was no more than 10 seconds .",
    "the 315 channels covering the velocity range 195 to -120 km @xmath12 were imaged with a velocity resolution of 1.0 km @xmath12 .",
    "the masers generally have a line width no larger than the spectral resolution of 1 km@xmath16 so are typically seen in a single channel .",
    "each pointing was imaged to a radius of 0.82 arcminutes from the pointing with a grid spacing of @xmath10 0.015@xmath15 and was cleaned to 300 mjy or a maximum of 300 components .",
    "images are typically 8000 @xmath2 8000 @xmath2 315 cells .",
    "the resolution is approximately 0.14@xmath15 @xmath2 0.05@xmath15 . due to the limited _ uv _ coverage and very large number of pixels in the images ,",
    "sidelobe levels are high and autoboxing was used to guide the clean .",
    "the rms noise in channel images without significant emission is @xmath10 20 mjy beam@xmath4 .",
    "each of the 900 single snapshot pointings was imaged independently and the results combined in a linear mosaic .",
    "overlapping image cubes were combined into a `` mosaic '' for each pointing using a grid of 6000@xmath17 with a pixel size of 0.015@xmath15 .",
    "the images were combined channel  by ",
    "channel by multiplying each channel image by the primary antenna pattern .",
    "grids of the image times the primary beam and the primary beam squared were interpolated and summed into the combined grid . when all overlapping pointing cubes were accumulated , the combined image was normalized by dividing the sum of the weighted images times antenna pattern by the sum of the antenna pattern squared .",
    "this results in an optimally weighted primary beam corrected image using all overlapping pointings .",
    "the relatively poor _ uv _ coverage of the single snapshot images results in a quite strong variation of the quality of the images from pointing to pointing depending on what emission is in the field .",
    "there are vastly more independent resolution elements in the image than independent _ uv _ samples in the data ; this complicates the detection of maser components .",
    "for source detection the `` mosaiced '' image cubes were collapsed to a single plane by summing the `` significant '' pixels in each plane .",
    "these were pixels in each image plane which were in excess of eight times the off  source rms and more than 0.25 times the brightest pixel in the channel image .",
    "this collapsed image was then searched for sources using obit task fndsou with a minimum acceptable flux density of 200 mjy beam@xmath4 .",
    "candidate masers were then selected before they were fitted by 2-d gaussians .",
    "note , this procedure will select continuum as well as maser sources .",
    "candidate masers were then tested using the spectrum extracted at the appropriate location from the combined spectral cube .",
    "the average flux density in each pixel s spectrum was subtracted to remove continuum emission .",
    "spectral features were accepted if the channel with the highest flux density had a value in excess of 8 times the rms measured within 50 pixels of the component .",
    "this removes continuum sources as well as the bulk of the imaging artifacts marked as candidate masers .",
    "the sparse uv - coverage and very large number of image pixels of the observations lead to a high level of imaging artifacts in regions with significant emission . in order to avoid including many of these artifacts as spurious sources ,",
    "relatively conservative criteria are needed for source selection .",
    "the likelihood of artifacts being included in the maser list depends strongly on the number and strength of true maser emission in the antenna beam .",
    "however , note that in areas where deeper , comparable resolution images are available ( sjouwerman et al . 2010 ) , the masers in table [ kamasercatalog ] are confirmed .",
    "the maser velocity and width were determined from a moment analysis around the channel with the peak flux density .",
    "errors in positions given in tables [ contkacat ] , and [ kamasercatalog ] are fitting errors accounting for the effects of correlated pixel noise @xcite and do not include calibration errors .",
    "astrometric calibration errors are dominated by the transfer of phases from the calibrator whose position is known to milliarcsecond accuracy to the target data .",
    "the calibrator , j1744 - 3116 , is approximately 2@xmath13 away on the sky and was observed every 200 seconds and phases were interpolated to the times of the target data .",
    "systematic errors should be under 1/3 of the sythesized beam which is of the order of 30 milliarcseconds .",
    "errors in peak flux densities are derived from the fitted gaussians in the source finding step accounting for the effects of correlated noise but do not include calibration errors .",
    "systematic flux density errors are dominated by 1 ) the transfer of the flux density of the primary calibrator ( 3c286 ) to the phase reference calibrator , 2 ) uncorrected atmospheric attenuation and 3 ) decorrelation due to atmospheric phase noise .",
    "the primary calibrator was generally observed at a much higher elevation than the phase reference calibrator which was at nearly the same , low , elevation as the target fields .",
    "target fields with strong emission were phase self calibrated which should effectively eliminate atmospheric decorrelation for these pointings .",
    "systematic flux density errors should be no more than 30% .",
    "the final catalog was derived by combining the source lists from each mosaic image and removing redundant entries from the overlap regions .",
    "the data from each pointing were imaged with a field of view of 1@xmath1 radius and cleaned to a flux density of 0.5 mjy beam@xmath4 or a maximum of 300 components .",
    "pointings containing sgr a * were phase self calibrated .",
    "overlapping pointings were combined on a `` mosaic '' at the position of each pointing center on a 8000@xmath28000 grid of 0.012@xmath15 cells .",
    "these images were searched for sources above 2 mjy beam@xmath4 or 8 times the rms within 200 pixels .",
    "rms noise levels are typically 0.25 mjy beam@xmath4 .      the observations were made with spectral windows centered on the rest frequency of the oh lines at 1612 , 1665 , 1667 and 1720 mhz and were made on may 31 , 2014 using the vla in `` a '' configuration .",
    "this gives a typical resolution of @xmath10 3.5@xmath15 @xmath2 1.2@xmath15 elongated north - south due to the declination of the region imaged .",
    "the region was covered by a mosaic of 11 overlapping pointings centered on positions given in figure [ lpointfig ] .",

    "the velocity range covered was @xmath10 -420 to + 235 km @xmath12 .",
    "the adopted rest frequencies were 1.612231 , 1.66540184 , 1.667359 and 1.72053 ghz .",
    "each pointing was observed for 2 minutes in three scans separated by about 45 minutes .",
    "flux density calibration used 3c286 and j1744 - 3116 was used as the phase reference calibrator .",
    "calibration followed the procedure given in section [ ch3ohcal ] except that hanning smoothing was not required .",
    "the l band data were imaged using faceting to cover the primary beam .",
    "continuum imaging was done on each pointing using all four sub - bands out to a radius of 30@xmath1 and cleaning 300 iterations .",
    "up to 3 iterations of phase self calibration was used for fields with a peak brightness greater than 50 mjy beam@xmath4 . in the quieter fields , the off source rms in the continuum images was @xmath101 mjy beam@xmath4 although with much variation and many artifacts from the strong ,",
    "almost completely resolved emission    spectral line channels were imaged to a radius of 13.6@xmath1 and cleaned up to 20 iterations or a minimum residual of 1 jy .",
    "typical rmses in line free channels are @xmath1050 mjy beam@xmath4 . autoboxing was used to guide the clean .",
