    "figure [ fig41-ord2 ] shows large positive jumps in @xmath5 between @xmath270 and @xmath107 for @xmath76 .",
    "this fact can be proved for all primes @xmath7 , by noting that @xmath271 this jumping behavior at powers of @xmath7 parallels that for @xmath272 , where states @xmath273 we see that the jump magnitude for @xmath274 is scaled down from that of @xmath275 by a factor approximately @xmath276 .",
