    "since the discovery of high-@xmath2 superconductivity in fe - based materials in 2008 ,  @xcite an enormous amount of effort has been invested to understand the microscopic behavior of these systems .",
    "iron pnictides and chalcogenides become superconductors either by hole- or electron - doping the systems , by application of external pressure or by a combination of both . in particular , uniaxial pressure is currently being intensively discussed as a possible route towards modifying the structural , magnetic and even superconducting properties of these systems .",
    "a regular sample below its magnetic and structural transition temperatures displays an equal number of opposite twin orthorhombic domains , effectively canceling out its anisotropic properties . to circumvent this issue and obtain a single orthorhombic domain sample ,",
    "uniaxial tensile stress has been widely employed to detwin iron pnictides like bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 and cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 @xcite and unveil its anisotropic properties  which have been argued to originate from electronic nematic degrees of freedom .",
    "@xcite theoretically , although it is clear that in the tetragonal phase the applied uniaxial pressure acts as a conjugate field to the orthorhombic order parameter , condensing a single domain ,  @xcite the nature of the detwinning process deep inside the orthorhombic phase remains an open question , since different mechanisms might be at play  such as twin boundary motion or reversal of the order parameter inside the domains .",
    "@xcite    besides promoting detwinning , uniaxial strain has also been shown to affect the thermodynamic properties of the iron pnictides .",
    "recent neutron scattering experiments on bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 under compressive stress along the in - plane * b * direction reported a progressive shift to higher temperatures of the magnetic transition  @xcite - a behavior also seen in @xmath3 by thermodynamic measurements .",
    "@xcite  and an apparent reduction of the magnetic moment  @xcite .",
    "moreover , blomberg _ et al .",
    "_ observed a significant uniaxial structural distortion in bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 under tensile stress , suggesting an enhanced response to external strain .",
    "@xcite more recently , it was found that epitaxially strained thin films of fese on a srtio@xmath4 substrate show an increase in critical superconducting temperatures up to 65 k , the highest reported @xmath2 so far .",
    "@xcite clearly , crystal lattice strain plays a key role for the magnetic , structural and superconducting properties in fe - based superconductors and a better understanding of the microscopic origin of such behavior is desirable .    in this work",
    "we combine density functional theory ( dft ) calculations and ginzburg - landau phenomenology to analyze the effects of uniaxial compressive stress as well as uniaxial tensile stress on the magnetic , electronic and structural properties of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 and cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 at low temperatures , deep inside the ordered phase .",
    "stress is measured in terms of equivalent hydrostatic pressure , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the stress tensor matrix and positive and negative pressures correspond to applying compressive and tensile stresses respectively .",
    "our _ ab initio_-derived estimates for the elastic constants in the orthorhombic phase agree well with experimental values .",
    "while no sign of a true structural or magnetic phase transition is observed in the range of pressures between @xmath7  gpa and @xmath8  gpa , at a critical pressure we observe a reversal of the magnetization , _",
    "i.e. _ exchange of ferromagnetic ( fm ) and antiferromagnetic ( afm ) directions , simultaneous to a discontinuous change in the orthorhombic order parameter @xmath9 , which also changes sign .",
    "this behavior has important consequences on the orbital @xmath10 and @xmath11 occupancies and is also related to the shift of the magnetic ordering temperature , as we argue below .",
    "furthermore , by employing a phenomenological ginzburg - landau model , we show that this behavior is intimately connected to the magneto - elastic coupling of the system , which by itself acts as an intrinsic conjugate field to the orthorhombic order parameter . as the applied compressive stress",
    "is enhanced towards a critical value , it eventually overcomes the effects of the magneto - elastic coupling , rendering the zero - pressure state energetically unstable and resulting in a simultaneous reversal of the magnetization and the orthorhombic order parameter .",
    "comparison of the dft - derived critical uniaxial pressures for cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 and bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 , combined with the ginzburg - landau result that the critical pressure is proportional to the magneto - elastic coupling , suggests that the latter is larger in cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 than in bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "we also propose low - temperature detwinning measurements to compare the experimental critical pressure with our _ ab initio _ estimates in order to clarify the dominant mechanism behind the detwinning process of orthorhombic iron pnictide crystals .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we summarize our computational methods , and in section iii we present our dft results .",
    "section iv is devoted to the ginzburg - landau analysis and comparison with dft calculations .",
    "section v contains the discussions and concluding remarks .",
    "details about the _ ab initio _ method are presented in the appendix .",
    "electronic structure calculations were performed within dft with the vienna ab initio simulations package ( vasp )  @xcite with the projector augmented wave ( paw ) basis  @xcite in the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) .",
    "all our structural relaxations were performed under constant stress using the fast inertial relaxation engine ( fire ) .",
    "@xcite for this purpose , we had to modify the algorithm accordingly ( see appendix a ) .",
    "every 10 steps , we cycled through non - magnetic , ferromagnetic , antiferromagnetic - checkerboard , stripe - type antiferromagnetic ( along unit cell axis * a * ) and stripe - type antiferromagnetic ( along unit cell axis * b * ) spin configurations , and then we continued the relaxation with the lowest energy spin configuration .",
    "as a final converged magnetic configuration in the orthorhombic phase we always found stripe - type antiferromagnetic order either along * a * or along * b * , as discussed below .    the energy cutoff in the calculations was set to 300  ev and a monkhorst - pack uniform grid of @xmath12 points was used for the integration of the irreducible brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "starting from the low - temperature orthorhombic structure with stripe magnetic order , we performed structure relaxations under applied uniaxial tensile and compressive stresses along * a * ( afm direction ) , * b * ( fm direction ) and the plane - diagonal * * a**+*b * direction for both bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 and cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 ( see inset of figure  [ ba_latticeparameters ]  ( a ) ) .",
    "we measure stress in units of the equivalent hydrostatic pressure , @xmath5 , with @xmath6 denoting the stress tensor matrix .",
    "we simulated pressures in the range between @xmath14  gpa and @xmath15  gpa . in the tensile stress range , below @xmath16  gpa",
    "we observe in both systems that , for stress along * a * , a sudden expansion in @xmath17 and contraction in @xmath18 and @xmath1 axes occurs .",
    "a similar situation arises when pulling apart along * b*. this feature signals the extreme case of absence of bonding within the material , and for this reason this pressure range will be excluded from further discussion .",
    "figure  [ ba_latticeparameters ] shows the evolution of lattice parameters for bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 as a function of uniaxial stress along * a * , * b * and * * a**+*b*. we consider both compressive stress ( positive pressure ) and tensile stress ( negative pressure ) . at @xmath19  gpa , we have @xmath17 ( afm direction ) @xmath20 @xmath18 ( fm direction ) .",
    "bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 remains in the orthorhombic phase with nonzero increasing magnetic moment for large tensile stress ( negative pressure ) .",

    "this interchange happens with a rotation of the magnetic order by 90 degrees , _",
    "i.e. _ the fm direction becomes parallel to the * a * axis while the afm direction becomes parallel to the * b * axis .",
    "we will discuss this feature further below .",
    "note that tensile stress along * * a**+*b * acts similarly on both * a * and * b * directions , which expand , while the * c * direction strongly compresses ( figures  [ ba_latticeparameters ]  ( c ) and ( f ) ) .    under application of compressive stress ( positive pressure ) , we observe in all three cases a strong expansion along * c * and a compression along the direction of applied stress * * ( * a * , * b * or * * a**+*b * ) .",
    "for the cases where pressure is applied along @xmath23 or @xmath24 , we observe almost no changes or a slight expansion along * b * and * a * , respectively .",
    "since @xmath25 at zero stress , we observe the inversion of axes followed by a jump in orthorhombicity and a 90 degree rotation of the magnetization when stress is applied along * a * at @xmath26  gpa ( figures  [ ba_latticeparameters ]  ( a ) and ( d ) ) .",
    "this inversion of axes , with @xmath27 for all higher compressive stress values means that the spin configuration shown in the inset of figure  [ ba_latticeparameters ]  ( a ) should now be turned by 90 degrees , with * b * pointing along the afm direction .",
    "such an inversion is also observed for compressive stress along * * a**+*b * at much larger pressures of @xmath28  gpa .",
    "figure  [ ba122moments ] shows the evolution of magnetic moment , volume and as height in bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 as a function of stress .",
    "the three quantities show a clearly monotonic behavior independent of the applied stress direction except for small jumps at the pressures @xmath22  gpa ( for stress along * a * ) and @xmath26  gpa ( for stress along * b * ) where the tetragonal condition is almost fulfilled ( @xmath17 @xmath29 @xmath18 ) ( figures  [ ba122moments ]  ( b ) , ( d ) , ( f ) ) .",
    "we also note here how magnetic moments in bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 respond to different direction of pressure application .",
    "the highest rate of suppression , of roughly 0.1@xmath30/gpa is achieved when pressure is applied within the @xmath31-plane , while application of pressure along the * c*-axis actually results in magnetic moment increase by 0.03@xmath30/gpa  @xcite .",
    "even though dft calculations overestimate the value of the ordered fe magnetic moment at @xmath19  gpa , it is to be expected that the relative changes in magnetic moment should provide a reliable description of the situation of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 under pressure as shown in previous studies .",

    "[ ba122moments ] , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    except for the pressures @xmath22  gpa ( for stress along * a * ) and @xmath26  gpa ( for stress along * b * ) , stress always enforces a certain degree of orthorhombicity and the system remains magnetically ordered with a decreasing ordered moment as a function of compressive stress ( figure  [ ba122moments ]  ( a ) ) .",
    "moreover , since the @xmath1 axis continually expands from negative to positive pressures , @xmath33 increases accordingly as a function of stress ( figure  [ ba122moments ]  ( e ) ) .",
    "these features have a direct consequence on the electronic properties of the system .    as an illustration",
    ", we show in figure  [ ba_fs ] the ( non - spin polarized ) fermi surface of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 under application of uniaxial stress @xmath34  gpa and @xmath35  gpa applied along * a * in the 1fe / unit cell equivalent brillouin zone .",
    "we would like to note that correlation effects beyond dft as implemented in dft+dmft ( dynamical mean field theory ) , which are known to give a good agreement between the calculated fermi surfaces and angle - resolved photoemission measurements in the fe pnictides ,  @xcite have not been included here .",
    "modest tensile stress of 0.07  gpa leads to the disappearance of the @xmath36 hole pocket around @xmath37 in the @xmath38 plane ( see figure  5  ( a ) in ref .  ) . on the other hand , when compressive stress is applied , the hole pockets around @xmath37 significantly change in size , and additionally at a pressure of 1.7  gpa , small electron pockets , of majority @xmath36 and @xmath39 character , appear along the @xmath40 directions of the bz ( figures  [ ba_fs ]  ( c ) and ( e ) ) .",
    "the increase of the @xmath36 hole pocket size with increasing uniaxial stress can be explained by the reduction of fe - fe distances along the * a * axis , leading to an increased contribution of @xmath36 - @xmath36 bonding . in fact , the effects of tensile and compressive stress on the electronic structure shown for the example of stress along * a * can be seen also in our calculations for both stress along * b * and along * * a**+*b*.        in figure  [ ba122dos ] we analyze the orbitally - resolved density of states at the fermi level @xmath41 . applying stress both along * a * and * b * has the same effect on the total density of states of both bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 and cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 , but there is a selective orbital order as shown in figure  [ ba122dos ] .",
    "@xmath41 is predominantly of @xmath42 character when @xmath25 and of @xmath43 character when @xmath44 .",
    "this means that the dominant character switches from @xmath43 to @xmath42 at @xmath45  gpa , and from @xmath42 to @xmath43 at @xmath46  gpa as expected .",

    "however , analogously to the case of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 , this is not followed by a suppression of the magnetic moments of iron .",
    "in fact , the @xmath1 axis expands with applied stress and at @xmath47  gpa the @xmath1 lattice parameter in cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 is too large for the formation of an interlayer as - as covalent bond , necessary for a transition to a collapsed tetragonal phase and suppression of magnetic moments as observed under hydrostatic or @xmath1-axis uniaxial pressure .",
    "@xcite for tensile stress along the ( shorter ) * b * direction , the reversal of afm and fm directions happens at @xmath48  gpa followed by a jump in the orthorhombicity .",
    "the magnetic response of cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 is highly anisotropic as well , but contrary to the case of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 , the magnetic moments in cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 are most effectively suppressed when pressure is applied along * c*. we measure a rate of about 0.1@xmath30/gpa  @xcite .",
    "application of pressure within the @xmath31-plane results in a suppression of the magnetic moment at a rate of 0.02@xmath30/gpa .        in order to investigate the possibility of a structural and/or magnetic phase transition at higher pressures , we concentrate now on compressive stress along the diagonal of the @xmath31-plane .",
    "we find that orthorhombicity is preserved up to 7.7  gpa , where a sharp transition to a tetragonal phase appears .",
    "this transition is of first - order type like the orthorhombic to collapsed tetragonal phase transition under application of hydrostatic or uniaxial pressure along the * c * axis  @xcite but in this case , changes of magnetic and structural properties take opposite directions ; the * c * axis undergoes a sudden expansion of about 9.5% , and * a * and * b * axes contract while the iron magnetic moments order ferromagneticaly and sharply increase in value by around 25% .",
    "interestingly though , contrary to the application of hydrostatic and uniaxial pressure along * c * axis , the volume change here is significantly smaller , namely an expansion by about 0.9% .",

    "the last condition ensures that the ground state is the striped magnetic configuration ( _ i.e. _ collinear @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) .",

    "interestingly , recent neutron diffraction experiments  @xcite on bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 observed that upon application of compressive stress along the * b * axis , the magnetic moment is suppressed from @xmath130 to @xmath131 .",
    "given the small values of applied pressure , it could be that this suppression is due to a reduction of the volume fraction of the domains whose moments are oriented out of the scattering plane , as pointed out by the authors of ref .  .",
    "nevertheless , in view of our current results , it would be interesting to either apply higher pressures to completely detwin the samples at low temperatures or to apply tensile stress to make a comparison with the case of compressive stress .",
    "we note that ref",
    ".   also found an enhancement of the magnetic transition temperature @xmath132 in the same detwinned samples .",
    "phenomenological models @xcite attribute this effect to changes in the magnetic fluctuation spectrum of the paramagnetic phase promoted by the uniaxial stress . in this regard",
    ", it would be interesting in future _ ab initio _ studies to systematically investigate the changes in the nesting feature of the fermi surface ( fig .",
    "[ ba_fs ] ) as function of the uniaxial stress - specifically , changes in the @xmath133 susceptibility peak .    finally , we comment on the impact of our results to the understanding of the detwinning mechanism of iron pnictide compounds . in the tetragonal phase ,",
    "rather small uniaxial stress @xmath134 mpa is enough to completely detwin the sample , giving rise to a single domain .",
    "@xcite this can be understood as fluctuations above the structural transition temperature giving rise to long - range order in the presence of a symmetry - breaking field .",
    "@xcite the situation is however very different deep in the orthorhombic phase , where twin domains are already formed . experimentally , it is known that larger pressures are necessary to completely detwin the system in this case ,  @xcite although specific values have not been reported , to our knowledge .",
    "one possible detwinning mechanism is the reversal of the orthorhombicity of one domain type , while the domain walls remain pinned .",
    "this corresponds precisely to the situation studied here , where the orthorhombicity jumps at a certain critical uniaxial pressure .",
    "our _ ab initio _ results show that such a critical pressure for bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 would be around @xmath135 mpa  one order of magnitude larger than the pressure values necessary to detwin the sample in the tetragonal phase",
    ".    of course , other mechanisms can also give rise to detwinning in the ordered phase , such as domain wall motion .",
    "therefore , we propose controlled detwinning experiments at low temperatures in bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 to measure the critical pressure necessary to form a single domain .",
    "values comparable to the ones discussed here would be a strong indication for reversal of the order parameter inside fixed domains .",
    "which mechanism is at play in the iron pnictides",
    "may have important consequences for the understanding of the impact of the external stress on the anisotropic properties measured in detwinned samples  particularly the in - plane resistivity anisotropy ,  @xcite which is likely affected by domain wall scattering .  @xcite",
    "within the fire  @xcite algorithm , the energy minimization is achieved by moving the system s position @xmath136 according to the following equation of motion : @xmath137\\,,\\label{fire_eq}\\ ] ] where @xmath138 denotes the unit vector along @xmath139 , with @xmath140 , @xmath141 is time and @xmath142 is a time - dependent friction parameter which assures that the system is moving down the energy hypersurface in an optimal manner as long as the power @xmath143 is positive . if @xmath144 becomes negative , the procedure is stopped and relaxation is reinitialized in the direction of the steepest descent .    in order to use fire for relaxation of periodic systems , we change from the configuration space of @xmath145 atomic cartesian coordinates @xmath146 , @xmath147 , to an extended system of @xmath148 coordinates @xmath149 , consisting of lattice vectors which are contained in columns of the @xmath150 matrix @xmath151 , and fractional atomic positions @xmath152 within the unit cell , where cartesian and fractional positions are related by @xmath153 .",
    "when is rewritten in terms of coordinates @xmath154 , one just needs to find the appropriate expression for forces @xmath155 , that is , derivatives of energy with respect to the coordinates @xmath154 .",
    "since stress and strain tensors , @xmath156 and @xmath157 , can be defined through @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the identity matrix and @xmath160 is the lattice matrix after an infinitesimal deformation , it is easy to show that @xmath161 so that forces in the extended coordinates are given by @xmath162.\\label{forces}\\ ] ] forces @xmath163 and stresses @xmath6 are obtained from the electronic structure code , and are inserted directly into eq .  , taking into account that @xmath164 , that is , total stress is the sum of internal and external stresses applied to the surface of the unit cell .",
