    "<S> a new method to generate and control the amplitude and phase distributions of a optical vortex beam is proposed . by introducing a holographic grating on top of the dielectric waveguide , the free space vortex beam and the in - plane guiding wave can be converted to each other . </S>",
    "<S> this microscale holographic grating is very robust against the variation of geometry parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the designed vortex beam generator can produce the target beam with a fidelity up to @xmath0 , and the working bandwidth is about @xmath1 nm with the fidelity larger than @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a multiple generator composed of two holographic gratings on two parallel waveguides are studied , which can perform an effective and flexible modulation on the vortex beam by controlling the phase of the input light . </S>",
    "<S> our work opens a new avenue towards the integrated oam devices with multiple degrees of optical freedom , which can be used for optical tweezers , micronano imaging , information processing , and so on .    </S>",
    "<S> optical vortex beams with phase singularities were firstly proposed by nye and berry in 1974 @xcite and proved to carry orbital angular momentum ( oam ) by allen _ et al . _ in 1992 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> oam is an intrinsic character of photon and allows the optical beam have a helical phase front and a phase singularity . </S>",
    "<S> beams carrying oam have the azimuthal angular dependence of @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the azimuthal index and @xmath5 is the azimuthal angle . since </S>",
    "<S> different oams are orthogonal to each other , thus oams of photons provide an alternative degree of freedom to encode information , for both classical and quantum mechanics . in principle , @xmath4 is an unbounded number , allowing the single photon to carry high dimensional information . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , oam has drawn interests for the potential applications in communication @xcite , optical microscopy @xcite , remote sensing @xcite and quantum information @xcite . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , the oam tweezers can be used as optical spanner to trap and rotate nanomechanics , atom ensembles and nanobio - molecules @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> there are different approaches to prepare and detect the vortex beams , such as diffraction gratings @xcite , spiral phase mirror @xcite and spatial liquid phase modulator @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . however , these methods are free space components , which occupy @xmath6 spaces , thus limiting the further scalability . </S>",
    "<S> alternative approaches based on the whispering gallery modes in microsphere @xcite and microring @xcite cavities and plasmonic structures @xcite are proposed and demonstrated . </S>",
    "<S> light traveling in the cavities can be converted to free space beam with non - zero oam , which is promising for the integration on the photonic chips , but only works for specific wavelengths with a very narrow bandwidth .    here , we propose a scheme of generating and manipulating vortex beams by integrated waveguides . </S>",
    "<S> the free space vortex beams are coupled with the guiding modes in the dielectric waveguides through diffraction elements , which is designed on the top surface of the waveguides by the holographic method . </S>",
    "<S> for single waveguide , high quality vortex beam with @xmath7 are generated , with the waist size of 0.5@xmath8 m . </S>",
    "<S> the performance of the integrated devices is very robust against the variation of width and length of diffraction gratings . remarkably , the working wavelength is broadband with bandwidth of about 175 nm for the 670nm - holographic grating . </S>",
    "<S> the most attractive advantage of the proposed vortex beam generator is the scalability , which permits multiple generator composed of a two - dimensional array of gratings fabricated on a single chip . </S>",
    "<S> the multiple generator allows the precise and real - time control of the beam . as an example </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate the manipulation of the beam shape and position by just controlling wavelength and phase of the input lasers to two waveguides .        </S>",
    "<S> the schematic of the proposed vortex beam generator is shown in fig.1(a ) , in which the incident light from one port of the waveguide ( in plane ) will be converted to free space ( in vertical direction ) vortex beam by the waveguide surface holographic grating ( wgshg ) . </S>",
    "<S> the wgshg is essential for our device , since it determines the qualities of the generated beams . </S>",
    "<S> the basic principle of the holographic grating is explained in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b1)-(b4 ) . at first step , </S>",
    "<S> the time - reversal of the target vortex beam is incident vertically to waveguide , and at the same time , there is also a guiding wave propagating from left to right in the waveguide ( fig.1(b1 ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the interference of the two wave fields leads to string with dark and bright patterns on the surface of the waveguide . </S>",
    "<S> the wgshg is generated by dividing the interference region into many pixels ( @xmath9 ) and setting a gray value of @xmath10 for each pixel @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here , we use the simple binary function according to the phase difference @xmath11 between the target vortex beam and the guiding wave , i.e. @xmath12 if @xmath13 , or else @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b2 ) gives the binary gray image of the holographic grating . </S>",
    "<S> due to the principle of holography , when the wgshg is fabricated , a conjugate guiding wave propagating along the waveguide ( the direction of the blue arrow is from right to left in fig.1(b3 ) ) will produce the target vortex beam . comparing the intensity and phase distributions of the input target beam and the generated beam , </S>",
    "<S> the reversal of the phase helicity indicates the time - reversal relation of two beams as a manifest of holographic principle . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , if a vortex beam is incident from the bottom of the waveguide , it will be converted into guiding wave in the waveguide traveling from right to left . </S>",
    "<S> thus , this would be potential for vortex beam detection .    </S>",
    "<S> in the following , we verify this idea by numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the waveguide with a width of @xmath15 is made of @xmath16 on a silica substrate . </S>",
    "<S> the refractive index of @xmath16 is taken as 2.0063 at the wavelength of @xmath17 nm . the electric field in the waveguide is in the form as @xmath18 and can be solved numerically , where @xmath19 is the amplitude of the electric field in the @xmath20-cross section , @xmath21 is the wave vector of guiding wave in the @xmath22-direction . in current study , we focus on the fundamental te mode , whose field distribution on the top surface of waveguide can be approximated by a gaussian function for @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the target vortex beam with oam @xmath7 is shown in the insets of fig.1(b4 ) , containing a donut amplitude distribution and a helical phase front with a singularity in the center . </S>",
    "<S> the waist of the target vortex beam is posited on the up surface of the waveguide with a diameter of 500 nm . </S>",
    "<S> the geometry of the wgshg is a rectangle with a width of @xmath15 ( same as waveguide ) and a length of @xmath24 . in the experiment , </S>",
    "<S> the dielectric nanostructure of the wgshg can be fabricated by etching the surface layer of the waveguide @xcite , or by nano - imprinting method @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more intriguing way to do so is to introduce a metallic nanostructure @xcite , which forms a metasurface @xcite , allowing efficient light extraction and precisely control of the local scattering phase at subwavelength .     </S>",
    "<S> but different widths @xmath25 and ( f)-(i ) corresponding to the holographic gratings with a fixed width @xmath26 but different lengths @xmath27 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> ( e ) and ( j ) are the fidelities of the obtained vortex beams as the functions of width b and length d , respectively . ]    in order to obtain a vortex beam with high quality , the size effect of the holographic grating is studied at first . figs . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a)-2(d ) give the simulation results of the obtained beam for the holographic gratings with a fixed length @xmath28 and different width @xmath25 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> here and in the following of this paper , the field distribution of the vortex beam are on the plane with a distance of @xmath29 away from the top surface of the waveguide . </S>",
    "<S> the up and down parts of the figures are the intensity and phase distributions , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> similar to the target vortex beam , the obtained beam has a null amplitude on the center and a helical phase distribution , which indicates that the obtained beam carries oam as the target vortex beam . </S>",
    "<S> when the width @xmath15 is changed , the phase distribution keeps the same helical distribution , and the amplitude distribution varies , which means that the fidelity of the obtained vortex beam is related to the width of the holographic grating . to qualify the quality of the generated vortex beam , the fidelity is introduced @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the amplitudes of the obtained and target vortex beams , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> because of the finite number of imaging pixels , the difference exists between the target beam and the obtained beam , which makes the fidelity @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> fig.2(e ) gives the fidelities of the vortex beams as the function of the width @xmath15 , where the fidelities are above 0.7 for @xmath15 in the range of @xmath34\\,\\mu$]m . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the fidelity increases with b to reach a highest one , and then decreases with b. the best fidelity is 0.93 when @xmath35 m , which is used as the width of the holographic grating in the following simulation . </S>",
    "<S> figs 2(f)-2(j ) studies the generation of the vortex beam depending on the grating length @xmath24 with the fixed width @xmath35 m . from the field distributions for @xmath36 m , @xmath24 has little effect on the phase distribution , but obvious effect on the amplitude distribution . the fidelity shown in fig.2(j ) </S>",

    "<S> ( e)-(h ) are the intensity ( left ) and phase ( right ) distributions for the guiding waves with @xmath39 , respectively , obtained from the holographic grating with @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) and ( j ) are the fidelity and the off set as the functions of wavelength , respectively . ]    </S>",
    "<S> use the optimum parameters obtained from the above results , we can produce vertex beam with high quality by the on - chip waveguide . </S>",
    "<S> further , we studied the generation of vertex beam with different wavelength and found that the wgshg is fascinating , because it can work in the wavelength ranged among @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> figs.3(a)-(d ) give the intensity ( left ) and phase ( right ) distributions of the obtained vortex beams for the wavelengths @xmath42 and @xmath43 , with fidelities @xmath44 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> once the holographic grating is fabricated , the geometry of the holographic grating is determined , but it can still be applied to a broadband wavelength . figs . </S>",
    "<S> 3(e)-(h ) give the intensity ( left ) and phase ( right ) distributions of the obtained vortex beams for the holographic gratings with wavelength @xmath45 , and the guiding waves with @xmath46 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the direction of the obtained vortex beam is no longer vertical to the waveguide , when the wavelenth of the guiding wave does not match with that of the holographic grating . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude and phase distributions are off set from the wavelength - matched case . </S>",
    "<S> figs . </S>",
    "<S> 3(i ) and 3(j ) give the fidelity and off set as the functions of the guiding wavelength , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the fidelity decreases as the guidin wavelength is far away from that of the holographic grating . for the guiding wavelength among @xmath47 , the fidelities are all above @xmath2 , which indicates the holographic grating is a brandband grating . </S>",
    "<S> the off set varies with the guiding wavelenth linearly , where it is minus for shorter wavelength and positive for longer wavelength , respectively . according to this linear ralation , the position of the obtained vortex beam can be controlled by manipulating the guiding wavelength , which improves the flexibility of the vortex beam generator .    to control the obtained vortex beam more flexibly , a multiple generator , composed of two gratings on top of two parallelly arrayed waveguides , </S>",
    "<S> are designed to generate the vortex beam . </S>",
    "<S> figure 4(a ) gives the schematic of generating vortex beam by the multiple generator , with the illustration of the holographic gratings on the waveguides in the inset . </S>",
    "<S> the width of each grating is 1 @xmath48 m , which is the same with that of each waveguide . </S>",
    "<S> the length of each grating is 2.5 @xmath48 m . </S>",
    "<S> the gap between the two gratings ( or the waveguides ) is 0.5 @xmath48 m , which makes the generated vortex beam have a high quality . </S>",
    "<S> there is a phase difference @xmath11 between the guiding waves in the waveguides a and b. lights diffracted from different gratings will interfere with each other to form different intensity distributions according to @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> so , the generated beam can be controlled by manipulating the phase difference between the guiding waves in the two waveguides . </S>",
    "<S> figs . </S>",
    "<S> 4(b)-4(k ) give the intensity and phase distributions of the vortex beams for various phase difference . </S>",
    "<S> when they are in - phase @xmath49 , the obtained beam has a null amplitude point and a phase singulary point on the center , which is the typical characteristic of a vortex beam . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath11 increases , the null amplitude point moves , and another null amplitude point appears gradually . for @xmath50 ( fig.4(d ) ) , there are two clear null amplitude points . </S>",
    "<S> while @xmath11 increases further , one of them disappears and only the other one exists . </S>",
    "<S> the phase singularity performs the same phenomena when @xmath11 varies ( figs . </S>",
    "<S> 4(g)-(k ) ) . since the phase difference of the guiding waves in the two waveguides can be manipulated arbitrarily and precisely , the reproduced light can be controlled flexibly , which allows the realization of manipulating the vortex beam .    , respectively . ]    in conclusion , the generation and modulation of the vortex beam are realized by the holographic grating on the waveguide . </S>",
    "<S> the quality of the obtained vortex beam is improved by optimizing the size of the holographic grating , and the fidelity of the obtained vortex beam is up to 0.93 . </S>",
    "<S> the holographic grating is proved to be broadband with a bandwidth of 175 nm for the 670 nm - holographic grating . </S>",
    "<S> the direction of the generated vortex beam can be controlled by the guiding wavelength linearly . </S>",
    "<S> further , the modulation of the obtained vortex beam can be realized by the multiple generator , which shows that both amplitude and phase of the obtained vortex beam can be modulated effectively through the phase difference between the guiding waves in the two waveguides . </S>",
    "<S> the generation and modulation of vortex beam by the holographic grating on the waveguide expands a route to provide light source with oam on a compact chip , which will play a key role in the integrated optics . </S>"
