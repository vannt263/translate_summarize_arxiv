    "the _ mirror game _ provides a simple paradigm to study social interactions and the onset of motor coordination among human beings , as it happens in improvisation theater , group dance and parade marching @xcite . in order to enhance social interaction through motor coordination",
    ", it would be desirable to create a virtual player ( vp ) or computer avatar capable of playing the mirror game with a human subject ( typically the patient ) either by mimicking similar kinematic characteristics or producing dissimilar ones @xcite .",
    "indeed , this allows to modulate the kinematic similarity of the vp while maintaining a certain level of coordination with the human player ( hp ) so that the s / he is unconsciously guided towards the direction of some desired movement features .",
    "motor coordination between two or more effectors in biological systems emerges as a result of the integration of several body parts and functions .",
    "such coordination occurs through two types of control actions : feedback and feed - forward @xcite .",
    "the motor system is able to correct the deviation from the desired movement by means of feedback control , whilst feed - forward control allows it to reconcile the interdependency of the involved effectors and preplan the response to the incoming sensory information , without taking into account how the system reacts to the command signal @xcite .",
    "inspired by the above motor process of the human body , a computational approach based on optimal control has been proposed in the literature for the vp to interact with other participants and reconcile movement coordination with its own prescribed kinematic features @xcite .",
    "the main challenge is to develop a mathematical model capable of driving the vp to joint - improvise with a hp in the mirror game , while guaranteeing an assigned _ motor signature _ as defined in @xcite .",
    "the first step towards this goal is to design a computational architecture able to generate _ in - silico _ trajectories reproducing the motor signature exhibited by a certain hp playing solo . in so doing ,",
    "we propose an approach based on velocity segments @xcite .",
    "the second step is to provide such architecture with an online algorithm allowing the virtual player to produce joint improvised motions and interact with a hp or another vp .",
    "much research effort has been spent on the design of control architectures for the virtual agent or robot @xcite , but only pre - recorded time series of human players in solo trials have been used to generate the joint motion of a customized vp @xcite , which limits its movement diversity due to the finite number of available pre - recorded trajectories .",
    "the approach we propose here overcomes this drawback by allowing the vp to autonomously exhibit any motor signature with specified kinematic features ( characterizing the solo motion of a given hp ) during the interaction with another agent .",
    "the outline of this paper is given as follows . in section [ sec : prob ] we introduce the experimental paradigm of the mirror game , a quantitative marker of motor signatures , and their construction method . in section [ sec : ca ] we focus on the design of a computational architecture for the vp .",

    "<S> extensive experiments in human movement science suggest that solo motions are characterized by unique features that define the individuality or motor signature of people . </S>",
    "<S> while interacting with others , humans tend to spontaneously coordinate their movement and unconsciously give rise to joint improvisation . </S>",
    "<S> however , it has yet to be shed light on the relationship between individuality and joint improvisation . by means of an ad - hoc virtual agent , in this work </S>",
    "<S> we uncover the internal mechanisms of the transition from solo to joint improvised motion in the mirror game , a simple yet effective paradigm for studying interpersonal human coordination . according to the analysis of experimental data , normalized segments of velocity in solo motion </S>",
    "<S> are regarded as individual motor signature , and the existence of velocity segments possessing a prescribed signature is theoretically guaranteed . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we first develop a systematic approach based on velocity segments to generate _ in - silico _ trajectories of a given human participant playing solo . </S>",
    "<S> then we present an online algorithm for the virtual player to produce joint improvised motion with another agent while exhibiting some desired kinematic characteristics , and to account for movement coordination and mutual adaptation during joint action tasks . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we demonstrate that the proposed approach succeeds in revealing the kinematic features transition from solo to joint improvised motions , thus revealing the existence of a tight relationship between individuality and joint improvisation . </S>"
