    "studies of ( @xmath7 ) reactions on nuclei provide information on the in - medium pion - nucleon ( @xmath8 ) interaction  @xcite , the properties of excited spin - isospin flip states of residual nuclei  @xcite and the properties of few - body systems  @xcite .",
    "a proper theoretical description of photonuclear reactions and in particular of pion photoproduction on nuclei , is a prerequisite for calculations performed for the photodisintegration of ultra - high energy nuclei in the cosmic microwave background  @xcite and on nuclear fragmentation reactions induced by virtual photons  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , data on nuclear pion photoproduction are scarce in the near - threshold region because of lack of relevant photon beams .",
    "the recently upgraded nuclear - physics beamline at max - lab is one of only a handful of facilities worldwide which can now provide a photon beam of appropriate energy .",
    "this is done by colliding a pulse - stretched electron beam  @xcite with a thin radiator and momentum analyzing the post - bremsstrahlung electrons in one of two tagging spectrometers  @xcite .",
    "that said , for the early measurements reported on in this paper , the tagging spectrometers were not yet commissioned .",
    "thus , in this untagged experiment , the photon - endpoint energy was 189 mev and the average photon - beam energy was estimated to be 176 @xmath9 2 mev ( see section 2.6 ) .",
    "some data on near - threshold pion production exist  @xcite but these come mainly from experiments with rather high pion detection thresholds . in this experiment , the two range telescopes allowed for a relatively low threshold for pion detection ( 8.4 and 8.7 mev ) which was achieved using a thin ( 3 mm ) first plastic detector and a compact telescope design .",
    "unfortunately , the limited solid - angle coverage and the fact that the absolute normalization of the data reported on here utilizes ( @xmath1,@xmath10 ) cross - sections from the literature result in large statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "the measured total cross - section data for @xmath0 photoproduction on @xmath11h , @xmath2c and @xmath3al , together with the corresponding differential ( d@xmath4/d@xmath5 ) and double differential ( d@xmath6/d@xmath5dt ) cross - section data have been compared with results from the reldis monte carlo model for photonuclear reactions  @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the quasi - deuteron absorption mechanism coexists with quasifree meson photoproduction on individual nucleons .",
    "the stretched electron beam from the max i ring  @xcite has long been used for photonuclear experiments at the tagged - photon facility at max - lab . as previously mentioned , in this , very first ( @xmath12 ) experiment , the tagging spectrometers  @xcite were not in operation .",
    "the electron beam was simply passing through a 150 @xmath13 m thick al radiator which produced a photon beam with bremsstrahlung energy distribution in the interval 0 - 189 mev .",
    "these photons passed through a 19 mm diameter collimator before impinging on experimental targets of c , cd@xmath14 and al with thickness 1 - 2 mm .",
    "all results on @xmath1 + @xmath11h reactions have been determined from the data on c and cd@xmath14 targets .",
    "the technique used to identify @xmath0 in this experiment was based on measuring the 26 ns @xmath15 decay in plastic scintillator range telescopes ( fig .",
    "1 ) . the efficiency for identifying pions depends here mainly - but not solely - on telescope geometry .",
    "it was important to minimize both the electronic noise through proper grounding and the room background through concrete shielding .",
    "after such precautions , we found that plastic scintillator telescopes of the chic design  @xcite were very effective at selecting pions .",
    "detection process in the range telescopes ( not to scale).,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    consequently , two telescopes of this type were designed for the experiment under the assumption of an effective upper limit in pion energy well below 50 mev .",
    "each telescope was comprised of five ne102 plastic scintillators ( s@xmath16 - s@xmath17 ) , which were read out by philips xp2020 photomultipliers ( pmts ) .",
    "table 1 presents the geometries chosen for the telescopes and the resulting energy bins for protons and pions that stop in each of the detector elements .",
    "since pion identification required at least two energy signals ( see below ) , the low - energy limit for pion detection was set essentially by the thickness of element s@xmath16 . including the minor energy loss that pions experience in target material , air and wrapping of the scintillators ( which is different for the two telescopes ) , the detection thresholds for pions were 8.4 @xmath9 0.1 mev and 8.7 @xmath9 0.1 mev for the 30@xmath18 and 90@xmath18 telescopes respectively .",
    "the maximum pion energies each telescope could stop were 57.5 mev and 49.9 mev , respectively .",
    "the fact that one single pion was registered in each of the two last ( s@xmath17 ) detectors shows that the choice of telescope thicknesses was reasonable .",

    "there is of course a shift from the ( @xmath32 ) channel to the quasi - deuteron absorption channel in this energy region but on the other hand , the @xmath1 + @xmath3al data do not show this enhanced falloff .",
    "this is in contradiction to the reldis results and the deviation is well outside statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "reldis results also exhibit a steeper falloff for heavier nuclei ( note that fig .",

    "another remark to fig .",
    "3 is that the @xmath0 cross - section in the @xmath1 + @xmath33h reaction does not follow the elementary @xmath1 + @xmath10 trend , but rather the trend established by the @xmath1 + nucleus reactions .",
    "it thus appears as if the presence of one single pn pair leads to the normal competition between the single nucleon and quasi - deuteron processes .     with t@xmath30 17 mev ( open points ) , @xmath34 9 mev ( squares ) and @xmath34 0 mev ( triangles ) , emitted in @xmath1 + @xmath2c reactions at 176 mev .",

    "3 , the falloff of @xmath0 photoproduction at energies @xmath36 180 mev was noted .",
    "4 shows that the differential cross - section , d@xmath4/d@xmath5 , decreases by a factor 4 - 7 if the detector limit is raised from 9 mev ( this experiment ) to 17 mev ( detection threshold in ref .",
    "the extrapolated increase in pion yield if the detection threshold could be lowered to 0 mev , is a factor of 1.5 - 2 .",
    "the trend exhibited by the data is reasonably well reproduced by reldis , with v@xmath37 = -20 mev .",
    "systematic uncertainties associated with the data points are are between 17@xmath35 and 23@xmath35 and the angular acceptance is @xmath9 5.4@xmath18 and @xmath9 7.3@xmath18 for the forward and 90@xmath18 telescopes respectively .     with t@xmath30 9 mev in @xmath1 + a ( see legend ) reactions at 176 mev .",

    "the excess pion yield was here essentially found in the forward hemisphere .",
    "this fact goes hand - in - hand with the assumption of an extended internal momentum distribution since the coupling of the relative momentum vector to the internal momentum vector produces a forward - focusing effect .",
    "however , there are other tentative explanations such as too strong reabsorption in the model that are plausible . finally , we note again that the @xmath1 + @xmath33h reaction behaves more like the reaction on heavier nuclei than the elementary process .",

    "4 ) was a slight underprediction by reldis with v@xmath21 = -20 mev which , however , rather tends to become an overprediction when extrapolating the data to t@xmath21 = 0 mev .",
    "the behaviour of the double differential cross - section as a function of pion kinetic energy ( fig .",
    "6 ) at 30@xmath18 and 90@xmath18 makes the overestimation even more plausible .",
    "the obvious overprediction for low t@xmath21 is to some extent compensated by more extended high energy tails in the data .",
    "the same tendencies are more pronounced for the @xmath1 + @xmath3al data ( fig .",
    "7 ) . in this case",
    ", reldis calculations exhibit no high - energy tail and the expected maximum in a coulomb shifted spectrum of @xmath0 from the one - nucleon scattering process seems to fall at lower energies in the calculations .",
    "all calculated curves in fig . 6 and 7",
    "have a steep rise in the second bin , corresponding to an effective coulomb barrier of @xmath381 mev .",
    "this appears to be too low , at least for the @xmath3al case , where a more realistic coulomb shift of 3 - 4 mev would improve the comparison .",
    "the choice of the optimal pion potential may suffer from this mismatch .",
    "more data , especially on reactions with heavy targets , are however needed to set this question . at present it appears reasonable to believe that the potential falls in the interval -20 mev to -15 mev for light nuclei , with the lower value more representing @xmath3al and the higher ( -15 mev ) representing @xmath2c .",
    "the form of the 30@xmath18 energy spectrum of @xmath0 from @xmath1 + @xmath33h reactions ( fig .",
    "7 ) is somewhat different in that the low energy point ( @xmath3811 mev ) has a low d@xmath6/d@xmath5dt value .",
    "even if this fact is significant , it must be stressed that the h@xmath14 data are derived as a difference between the ch@xmath14 target and c target data , which makes the systematic uncertainties larger , 26 - 28@xmath35 , than for the other targets .",
    "near - threshold ( @xmath1,@xmath39 ) reactions in light nuclei may be described by an intranuclear cascade model like reldis .",
    "this means that the basic processes in reldis at these energies namely quasi - deuteron absorption and photon absorption on a single bound nucleon , should be dominant .",
    "chosing depth of the real pion potential of -20 to -15 mev results in reldis predictions which match the data .",
    "our approach to pion - nucleus reactions is similar to the one adopted in the liege intranuclear cascade model  @xcite , which was recently reconsidered in theoretical investigations of the average potential energy felt by a pion inside the nucleus .",
    "our finding of @xmath40 = -20 mev agrees well with the values found in the literature @xcite , with a surface component of @xmath40 between -5 and -25 mev . since low - energy pions , produced in the central part of a nucleus ,",
    "are more easily absorbed than those produced close to the nuclear surface , it is relevant to use this surface component of @xmath40 for the comparison .",
    "the shapes of the experimental @xmath0 angular and ( in particular ) energy distributions differ from reldis predictions .",
    "furthermore , the total @xmath0 yield in heavier nuclei is underestimated by the code by a large factor .",
    "model particulars , such as the effective coulomb potential , the exact form of the degenerate nucleon momentum distribution and the energy and density dependence of the pion potential could certainly be tuned to improve the comparison .",
    "the discrepancies also hint that multinucleon channels can play a role not only in pion absorption but also in pion production processes    @xmath0 cross - sections per proton are much higher in the elementary @xmath1 + @xmath10 reaction than in @xmath1 + nucleus reactions close to threshold .",
    "the fact that the @xmath1 + @xmath33h data follow the @xmath1 + nucleus trend indicates that the balance between quasi - deuteron absorption and single - nucleon absorption is achieved already for deuteron reactions .",
    "in fact , all data from this experiment indicate that the effects of the nuclear environment are small for nuclei with a @xmath36 30 .",
    "we look forward to studying the details of the pion production mechanism in forthcoming tagged ( @xmath1,@xmath39 ) experiments at max - lab at energies up to @xmath38220 mev in the very near future .",
