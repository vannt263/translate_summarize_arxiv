    "<S> these collective states , that could be viewed as incompressible deformations of the electron liquid , are similar to the optical beams . </S>",
    "<S> such similarity has led to the emergence of a new subfield of condensed matter physics , electron optics @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the qh edge states can be described in the framework of the low - energy effective theory approach @xcite , where the effective hamiltonian is constructed from the general considerations of locality and gauge invariance . </S>",
    "<S> such approach has a great success in describing recent electron optics experiments in the regime of integer qh effect , where an integer number @xmath0 of landau levels is filled with electrons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it has been fruitfully applied to strongly out - of - equilibrium situations , which take place in experiments on dephasing of the edge states @xcite and on the energy relaxation at the qh edge @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this progress is due to the recent development of the technique of non - equilibrium bosonization @xcite , which allows to treat coulomb interactions non - perturbatively in systems far from equilibrium .    </S>",
    "<S> non - equilibrium systems exhibit reach physical phenomena such as , e.g. , pre - thermalization of cold atomic gases , driven out of equilibrium by a quench @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another way of preparing a non - equilibrium state is coupling two equilibrium systems with different parameters . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , non - equilibrium qh edge states are typically created by bringing two edges with chemical potential difference @xmath1 close to each other , so that electrons can tunnel across the so formed quantum point contact ( qpc ) . </S>",
    "<S> it has been found in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that there are two stages in the process of equilibration of such state at an integer qh edge . </S>",
    "<S> first , coulomb interactions lead to relaxation to an intermediate non - equilibrium state , similar to the pre - thermalized states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then additional slower energy exchange mechanisms , such as , e.g. , disorder , allow electrons to equilibrate to an actual fermi distribution . </S>",
    "<S> this is manifested with an intermediate asymptotic in the energy distribution function of electrons downstream of a biased qpc , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ intermed ] . </S>",
    "<S> note , that such behavior is a consequence of the integrability of dynamics of interacting one - dimensional electrons .    </S>",
    "<S> [ intermed ]    such intermediate energy distribution function has a power - law asymptotic in contrast to the exponential decay of a fermi distribution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , a detection of the non - equilibrium states by measuring directly the distribution function might be intricate at typical values of tunnelling amplitude at the qpc , since the non - equilibrium distribution could be quantitatively similar to the fermi distribution . </S>",
    "<S> one can overcome this obstacle by measuring a quantity which has qualitatively different behaviour in this state and at equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> one of such quantities is the noise power of weak backscattering currents @xmath2 measured at a second , detector qpc @xcite , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ conc ] : @xmath3 it has been studied in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in the case of integer qh effect , where the intermediate asymptotic manifests itself in a non - analytic behaviour @xmath4 at small values of the tunnelling amplitude @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the noise power behaves as @xmath6 if a true thermalization occurs .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , i investigate the non - equilibrium states in case of the _ fractional _ qh effect . </S>",
    "<S> the physics of fractional qh edge is more rich , since the fundamental excitations are not electrons but anyons with fractional charge and statistics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , i find that the phenomenon of intermediate stationary state takes place in this case as well , but its manifestations are more dramatic . </S>",
    "<S> i study the behavior of the effective temperature of edge states , measured by one of the following detectors : by a second qpc via the backscattering noise power as discussed above ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ conc ] ) and by a quantum anti - dot ( qd ) @xcite via qd level broadening ( see supplementary materials ) . </S>",
    "<S> navely , one could think that these setups could be described using the perturbation theory in tunnelling at contacts . </S>",
    "<S> however , it has been shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that such perturbation theory is divergent and fails at zero temperature . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , i resort to the non - equilibrium bosonization @xcite and show that it can be used for a _ non - perturbative _ treatment of the source qpc in the weak backscattering limit , where rare backscattering events of quasi - particles between edges have poissonian statistics .    using such approach </S>",
    "<S> , i find the central result of this letter : the universal linear scaling of the effective temperature with the injected current , @xmath7 this scaling does not depend on the filling factor and is not modified neither by interactions at the edge nor by interactions between the edge states and the detector . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it is drastically different from scaling that one expects after eventual equilibration of the edge states . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , at equilibrium at the temperature @xmath8 , the energy flux at the qh edge reads @xmath9 , see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the temperature of the edge states after a qpc where power @xmath10 is dissipated behaves as : @xmath11 such dependence is qualitatively different from ( [ noise - res ] ) in the situation of fractional qh effect , where current - voltage characteristics of the qpc are highly non - linear . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , i clarify the reason for the perturbative divergence of noise mentioned above , it is the behavior of the noise power @xmath12 , that is not - analytic for the fractional values of the quasi - particle correlation function scaling dimension @xmath13 .    in my analysis </S>",
    "<S> i focus on the @xmath14 series of fractional qh states which are now extensively studied experimentally @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting feature of these series is the presence of neutral upstream modes . </S>",
    "<S> such modes have been predicted theoretically in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and experimentally detected recently @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they are interesting for two reasons : first , there is no average detector current , if the detector is upstream of the injection qpc , which makes the measurement of the effective temperature more simple . </S>",
    "<S> second , there is an opportunity to use the two - qpc setup to distinguish effective models with different values of coupling of quasi - particle excitations to the neutral mode .    </S>",

    "<S> i show that the effective temperature measured in the two proposed schemes is not sensitive to the scaling @xmath13 at all . </S>",

    "<S> using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ tun - amp ] ) i find that the noise power is determined by the correlation functions of the quasi - particle operators : @xmath40 at equilibrium , the correlation function is given by eq .  </S>",

    "<S> . note , that i assume that @xmath45 , so that the noise generated by the detector qpc is small , i.e. , that such thermometer perturbs the state weakly .    assuming zero base temperature , the correlation function for @xmath46 is evaluated over the ground state @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> as discussed above , the perturbative theory is divergent and one needs to find a non - perturbative expression for the correlation function at the upper , @xmath48 , edge in a non - equilibrium state created by the backscattering processes at the source qpc . </S>",

    "<S> [ simple ] . at large times , the numbers @xmath55 could be considered classical fluctuating quantities and the correlation function factorizes @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the purely non - equilibrium contribution expressed via the full counting statistics generator @xcite of the quasi - particles backscattering process : @xmath58    although in general the full counting statistics generator @xmath59 is a complex quantity , two important simplifications arise in the limit of weak backscattering : first , all the cumulants of quasi - particle numbers for the rare , poissonian , process are equal to the average number @xcite of backscattered particles @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> note that factor 2 appears since we have two flavours of quasi - particles that both contribute to the current @xmath61 . </S>",

    "<S> \\label{chi - res}\\ ] ] second , the main contribution to integral ( [ noise - int ] ) comes from large times @xmath63 , exactly where backscattering could be considered a classical markovian process and result ( [ chi - res ] ) is valid . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , correlation time for tunnelling across qpc is @xmath64 , that is present in correlation function eq .  </S>",

    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ] so that if the backscattering probability @xmath65 is small , then contribution comes from times that are much larger than the correlation time . </S>",
    "<S> note that asymptotic eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ chi - res ] ) is insensitive to any complicated details of backscattering at the fractional qh edge .    </S>",

    "<S> ( [ temp - eq ] ) i indeed get the behavior ( [ noise - res ] ) independently of the scaling dimension @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> an important remark is in order . </S>",
    "<S> note that scaling of the backscattering noise power with the voltage bias at the injection qpc , @xmath67 , differs from scaling of the current ( [ curr ] ) or of the equilibrium noise ( [ temp - eq ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this means that it would be easier to experimentally distinguish different but close values of @xmath13 given by different effective models by measuring this non - equilibrium scaling .    </S>",
    "<S> one may think that the behavior of the effective temperature found above is only specific of a particular qpc - based detection scheme . </S>",
    "<S> therefore i also show that a qd - based detection scheme leads to exactly the same result , see supplementary materials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , one can speculate that such behavior is quite general for the situation of a weakly coupled thermometer . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , such thermometer requires long time to measure the effective temperature and therefore it should be sensitive only to the long time asymptotic of the correlation functions at the edge , while the latter depend only on the average current in the universal manner , see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ chi - res ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> _ discussion of results._ i show that the non - equilibrium state created by coupling two fractional qh edges relaxes through an intermediate stationary state that is qualitatively different from an equilibrium one . </S>",
    "<S> namely , the non - equilibrium bosonization approach allows to reduce the complex problem of non - perturbative treatment of fractional qh edge states to evaluating full counting statistics of a partitioned qpc , and ultimately to a simple poissonian process , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ simple ] . </S>",
    "<S> universal behavior of poissonian statistics leads to exponential decay of the correlation function ( [ chi - res ] ) similar to equilibrium one . </S>",
    "<S> that , in turn , leads to a possibility to express the the noise power and the level broadening generated by intermediate state in terms of an effective temperature which has a linear dependence on the injected current .    </S>",
    "<S> main physical consequence of these results is an experimental way to detect the pre - thermalization type phenomena @xcite for fractional qh edge states , and essentially in arbitrary luttinger liquid type system . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the obtained results show that the measurement of scaling of the backscattering noise with the bias in such states can be used to efficiently distinguish effective models of qh edge states .    </S>",
