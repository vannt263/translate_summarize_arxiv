    "fuzzy set _ we always mean a function @xmath0 \\to [ 0,1]$ ] , with @xmath1\\subseteq{{\\mathbb{r}}}$ ] , the real unit interval . throughout",
    ", we fix an integer @xmath2 , and a finite , non - empty family @xmath3 of fuzzy sets .",
    "we further always assume that each @xmath4 is a continuous function with respect to the usual ( euclidean ) topology of @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "we address here the general question , what is the logical content of the family of fuzzy sets @xmath5 . by way of motivation ,",
    "let us think of the real unit interval @xmath1 $ ] as the normalised range of values of a physical observable , say temperature .",
    "then each @xmath6 can be viewed as a means of assigning a _ truth value _ to a proposition about temperature in some many - valued logic @xmath7 . had one no information at all about such propositions , one",
    "would be led to identify them with propositional variables @xmath8 , subject only to the axioms of @xmath7 .",
    "intuitively , however , _ the set @xmath5 does encode information about @xmath9_. for example , consider @xmath10 as in fig .",
    "[ fig : ruspini ] , and say @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 provide truth values for the propositions @xmath14 `` the temperature is low '' , @xmath15 `` the temperature is medium '' , and @xmath16 `` the temperature is high '' , respectively .",
    "the shape of the functions in @xmath5 intuitively tells us that it is never the case that the observed temperature is both low and high .",
    "more generally , at an intuitive level it is clear that _",
    "@xmath5 encodes a body @xmath17 of knowledge about the specific application domain _ ( here , about temperature ) .",
    "how can we make this intuition precise ?",
    "if @xmath7 has a conjunction @xmath18 interpreted by minimum , the proposition @xmath19 has @xmath20 as its only possible truth value , _",
    "i.e._it is a contradiction .",
    "the chosen set @xmath5 then leads us to add _ extra - logical axioms _ to @xmath7_e.g . _ @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a negation connective  in an attempt to express the fact that one can not observe both a high and a low temperature at the same time .",
    "more generally , we see that _",
    "@xmath5 implicitly encodes a theory @xmath23 over the pure logic @xmath7_a _ theory _ being a family of formul  required to hold , thought of as extra - logical axioms .",
    "crucially , the theory @xmath23 is determined independently of the specifics of the available connectives .",
    "set @xmath24\\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( here , @xmath25 is a formula of @xmath26 over the variables @xmath27 , and @xmath28 denotes the evaluation of @xmath25 at @xmath29^n$ ] . ) under the sole assumption that @xmath26 has a sound @xmath1$]-valued semantics , it is easy to show that @xmath23 as in ( [ t : thetap ] ) is a ( deductively closed ) theory over @xmath26 ; see lemma [ l : lemmino ] below .    in traditional terminology ,",
    "the axioms of the logic @xmath26 ( along with their deductive consequences ) are to be thought of as _ analytic truths _ , which hold true by virtue of their form alone , independently of the circumstances .",
    "analytic truths are the subject matter of logic proper ; however , by their very nature , they carry no information about `` the world '' : whichever analytic truth one utters about temperature , one can equally well utter about , say , pressure . by contrast , the additional formul , or extra - logical axioms , that feature in a theory are to be thought of as _ synthetic truths_assertions that are truthful only within a specific domain of application , by virtue of properties of that domain .",
    "so , for example , in dealing with a certain ( ideal ) gas one may wish to assert as a _ physical _ ( hence extra - logical ) _ truth _ that the product of the volume and the pressure is constant at constant temperature .",
    "but there is of course no way of deducing such a statement from the axioms of classical logic : a world in which this specific law fails is conceivable , _",
    "i.e._is logically consistent , and hence whatever the truth expressed by the law , it is a factual , or contingent , or synthetic truth .",
    "the completeness theorem then tells us that the statement in question is not formally derivable from the axioms of classical logic , because it has a counter - model , namely , the possible world wherein it fails . in this precise sense , _ logic can teach us nothing _ ( factual ) : good grades in logic wo nt help with your physics class .    in light of the foregoing",
    ", we now see how to relate the two statements :    1 .",
    "@xmath5 determines a theory @xmath23 over @xmath26 , and 2 .",
    "@xmath5 encodes a body @xmath17 of knowledge about the specific application domain .    indeed , _",
    "@xmath23 is none other than a verbalisation of @xmath17 _ : an exposition of @xmath17 in formul , so to speak .",
    "but while ( s1 ) does provide the desired clarification of the intuition ( s2 ) , @xmath23 may end up being a mere approximation to @xmath17 ; after all , the linguistic resources offered by @xmath26 are limited . the differential relationship between acceleration and velocity , for example ,",
    "is hardly exactly expressible within most formal system that go under the name of `` logics '' .    in this paper",
    "we are concerned with one instance of the general problem of making explicit the extra - logical information implicitly encoded by @xmath5 . in a previous paper @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) , we addressed and solved this problem in case the background logic @xmath26 is _ gdel - dummett infinite - valued propositional logic _",

    "ruspini partition _ , _",
    "i.e. _  such that @xmath30 for each @xmath31 $ ] .",
    "there , we proved that gdel - dummett logic can only capture the semantical notion of ruspini partition up to an equivalence relation that we determined exactly . here , we address the problem of identifying the synthetic , factual content of _ triangular bases of fuzzy sets _ , a notion strictly stronger than ruspini partitions .",
    "such triangular bases commonly occur in applications .",
    "the set @xmath32 provides an example ; please see definition [ def : triangularbasis ] below for details . throughout the paper",
    ", we will take @xmath26 to be _ ukasiewicz infinite - valued propositional logic _",
    "@xcite ; background is provided in section [ ss : luk ] . it is well known that ukasiewicz logic is able to express addition of real numbers exactly , and so does axiomatise ruspini partitions exactly .",
    "we shall prove in theorem ii of section [ s : axiom ] the stronger result that ukasiewicz logic axiomatises the notion of triangular bases of fuzzy sets almost exactly ; specifically , the logic axiomatises _ pseudo - triangular bases _ ( see definition [ def : triangularbasis ] ) , a mild weakening of triangular bases .",
    "it will transpire that the reason why the latter can not be characterised exactly is that the logic does not express _ affine linearity _",
    ", though , as mentioned , it does express addition . besides a fair amount of standard machinery in ukasiewicz logic , the proof of theorem ii uses theorem i , which we prove in section [ s : char ] . here",
    "we characterise pseudo - triangular bases of fuzzy sets by elementary properties of the set of functions @xmath5 which strengthen the ruspini condition . in the final section [ s : further ]",
    "we discuss further research , and connections with previous work on the algebraic semantics of ukasiewicz logic .",
    "fuzzy sets are often required to satisfy additional conditions that are deemed useful for the specific application under consideration .",
    "here is a popular one that we already mentioned in the prologue , and is usually traced back to @xcite .",
    "we say @xmath5 is a _ ruspini partition _ if for all @xmath33 $ ] @xmath34 we further say that @xmath5 is _ @xmath35-overlapping _ if for all @xmath33 $ ] and all triples of indices @xmath36 one has @xmath37 figure [ fig : ruspini ] shows a family of fuzzy sets which is both ruspini and @xmath35-overlapping .    -overlapping family of fuzzy sets .",
    "]    the ruspini and the 2-overlapping conditions ( [ eq : ruspini][eq:2overlap ] ) apply to a family of fuzzy sets . in the literature ,",
    "several properties applicable to a single fuzzy set have been considered too .",
    "one of these we are assuming throughout , as stated at the beginning ; namely , continuity .",
    "further , a fuzzy set @xmath0 \\to [ 0,1]$ ] is _ normal _ if there exist @xmath33 $ ] such that @xmath38 . if , moreover , @xmath39 for all @xmath40 $ ] with @xmath41 , we say that @xmath42 is",
    "_ strongly normal_. the fuzzy sets @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 depicted in figure [ fig : ruspini ] are strongly normal . the last property we wish to consider is convexity .",
    "following @xcite , it is common to consider a weaker form of convexity than the classical one .",
    "the fuzzy set @xmath43\\to [ 0,1]$ ] is _ _ min - convex _ _ if for all @xmath44 $ ] , @xmath45 and it is _ strictly min - convex _",

    "we define the notion of _ strict min - convexity of @xmath42 on its support _ in the same manner , _ mutatis mutandis_.    a min - convex fuzzy set is shown in figure [ fig : min - con ] ; a non - min - convex fuzzy set is shown in figure [ fig : nmin - con ] .",

    "there is one last property of fuzzy sets that we consider in this paper :    [ d : separating ] a finite family @xmath53 of fuzzy sets is _ separating _ if for all @xmath48 $ ] , with @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "it may be remarked that many families of fuzzy sets that have been investigated in the literature , or have been used in implementations , indeed are separating  the set in figure [ fig : ruspini ] being a typical instance .",
    "we shall see in due course that the property is a crucial feature of such examples , _ cf .",
    "_  theorem ii below .    instead of asking that @xmath5 ( or its members )",
    "satisfy a given general property such as the ones above , we can decide to restrict the choice of fuzzy sets to a prototypical class of functions .",
    "so , for example , a fuzzy system might use sigmoid , or triangular , or trapezoidal functions only . in the case of triangular functions ,",

    "it is an exercise to check that this definition agrees with definition [ def : triangularbasis ] in case @xmath352 .",
    "it is also easy to see that schauder bases are ruspini partitions .",
    "unfortunately , however , no elementary characterisation of schauder bases analogous to our theorem i is known .",
    "nonetheless , abstract characterisations of schauder bases have been obtained using homology and other mathematical tools @xcite .",
    "this leads to the notion of _ abstract schauder bases _ , the higher - dimensional analogue of pseudo - triangular bases of fuzzy sets , originally introduced in the last - named author s ph.d .  thesis .",
    "remarkably , ukasiewicz logic does express the notion of abstract schauder basis , so that it is possible to formulate a higher - dimensional analogue of our theorem ii .",

    "structures closely related to mv - algebras , the algebraic semantics of ukasiewicz logic  the interested reader is referred to @xcite , and to the references therein . for an account of bases in the context of mv - algebras and ukasiewicz logic themselves , see @xcite .",
    "ukasiewicz and gdel - dummett logics are part of a hierarchy of systems based on _ triangular norms _ ; see @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that the hierarchy , together with its generalisations , provides a framework that makes precise the notion of _ mathematical fuzzy logic _ @xcite .",
    "the proof of lemma [ l : lemmino ] above , though easy , does say that the programme of axiomatising properties of fuzzy sets by means of a @xmath1$]-valued logic makes sense at a very general level .",
    "it is important to stress that , to carry this programme out , one needs a reasonably complete set of analogues of standard notions in mathematical logic_e.g . _  deductively closed theories and axiomatisations",
    ". mathematical fuzzy logic , in the sense above , does provide such analogues .",
    "it is therefore possible , at least in principle , to develop this line of research extensively .",
    "the benefits would surely be equally distributed between the theoretical and the application - oriented parties .",
    "one knows more about , say , gdel - dummett logic as a theoretical many - valued system , if one knows exactly to what extent the logic is capable of expressing the semantical notion of ruspini partition .",
    "and one can make more conscious design choices in facing , say , the problem of developing a specific fuzzy - based control system , if one has that very same information about gdel - dummett logic available .",
