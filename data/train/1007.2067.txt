    "projectile fragmentation reaction is used extensively to study the reaction mechanisms in heavy ion collisions at intermediate and high energies .",
    "this is also an important technique for the production of rare isotope beams and is used by many radioactive ion beam facilities around the world .",
    "the fragment cross sections of projectile fragmentation reactions using primary beams of @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath0 and @xmath2 at 140 mev / nucleon on @xmath3 and @xmath4 targets have been measured at the national superconducting cyclotron laboratory at michigan state university@xcite .",
    "the canonical thermodynamical model(ctm)@xcite has been used to calculate some of these fragment cross sections@xcite . in the present work",
    ", an evaporation code has been developed and has been coupled with the canonical thermodynamical model .",
    "ctm coupled with this secondary decay code is then used to analyze the isoscaling data from the projectile fragmentation reactions .",
    "the lighter fragments produced from these reactions exhibit the linear isoscaling@xcite phenomena and our model calculation also strongly supports this observation .",
    "the secondary fragments ( produced after applying the evaporation code on the canonical model ) also exhibit isoscaling like the primary fragments from the fragmentation reaction@xcite but the temperature needed to reproduce the experimental data with the secondary fragments is lower than that required by the calculation with the primary fragments .",
    "the isoscaling parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 as obtained in the present work from the model calculations agree closely with those obtained from the experimental data .",
    "these parameters as obtained from the secondary fragments are lower in magnitude than those obtained from the primary ones .",
    "this effect is also seen in the dynamical models @xcite though the reduction is much more there .",
    "the isoscaling behaviour displayed by the fragments produced in the projectile fragmentation reactions and the effect of evaporation on it in the framework of the hipse model has been discussed recently in @xcite .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "first we describe the canonical model briefly in sec.ii . in the same section we also present the main features of the evaporation code which is used to calculate the secondary fragments . in sec.iii",
    "we present the results .",
    "the effect of sequential decay on the distribution of the isotopic fragments is discussed .",
    "the isoscaling phenomena as displayed by the primary as well as the secondary fragments is also described in this section and are compared with the experimental data . in sec .",
    "iv we present the summary .",
    "in models of statistical disassembly of a nuclear system formed by the collision of two heavy ions at intermediate energy one assumes that because of multiple nucleon - nucleon collisions a statistical equilibrium is reached .",
    "consequently , the temperature rises .",
    "the system expands from normal density and composites are formed on the way to disassembly .",
    "as the system reaches between three to six times the normal volume , the interactions between composites become unimportant ( except for the long range coulomb interaction ) and one can do a statistical equilibrium calculation to obtain the yields of composites at a volume called the freeze - out volume .",
    "the partitioning into available channels can be solved in the canonical ensemble where the number of particles in the nuclear system is finite ( as it would be in experiments ) . in the next subsection",
    "we describe the canonical model .      in this section",
    "we describe briefly the canonical thermodynamical model .",
    "assume that the system with @xmath9 nucleons and @xmath10 protons at temperature @xmath11 , has expanded to a higher than normal volume and the partitioning into different composites can be calculated according to the rules of equilibrium statistical mechanics . in a canonical model , the partitioning",
    "is done such that all partitions have the correct @xmath12 ( equivalently @xmath13 ) .",
    "details of the implementation of the canonical model can be found elsewhere @xcite ; here we give the essentials necessary to follow the present work .",
    "the canonical partition function is given by @xmath14 here the sum is over all possible channels of break - up ( the number of such channels is enormous ) which satisfy @xmath15 and @xmath16 ; @xmath17 is the partition function of one composite with neutron number @xmath18 and proton number @xmath19 respectively and @xmath20 is the number of this composite in the given channel .",
    "the one - body partition function @xmath17 is a product of two parts : one arising from the translational motion of the composite and another from the intrinsic partition function of the composite : @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the mass number of the composite and @xmath23 is the volume available for translational motion ; @xmath23 will be less than @xmath24 , the volume to which the system has expanded at break up .",
    "we use @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the normal volume of nucleus with @xmath10 protons and @xmath27 neutrons . in this calculation",
    "we have used a fairly typical value @xmath28 .",
    "the probability of a given channel @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 the average number of composites with @xmath18 neutrons and @xmath19 protons is seen easily from the above equation to be @xmath31 the constraints @xmath15 and @xmath16 can be used to obtain different looking but equivalent recursion relations for partition functions@xcite .",
    "for example @xmath32 these recursion relations allow one to calculate @xmath33    we list now the properties of the composites used in this work .",
    "the proton and the neutron are fundamental building blocks thus @xmath34 where 2 takes care of the spin degeneracy . for deuteron , triton ,",
    "@xmath35he and @xmath36he we use @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the ground state energy of the composite and @xmath39 is the experimental spin degeneracy of the ground state .",
    "excited states for these very low mass nuclei are not included . for mass number @xmath40 and greater",
    "we use the liquid - drop formula . for nuclei in isolation , this reads ( @xmath22 ) @xmath41\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the derivation of this equation is given in several places @xcite so we will not repeat the arguments here .",
    "the expression includes the volume energy , the temperature dependent surface energy , the coulomb energy and the symmetry energy .",
    "the term @xmath42 represents contribution from excited states since the composites are at a non - zero temperature .",
    "we also have to state which nuclei are included in computing @xmath33 ( eq.(17 ) ) . for @xmath43 ,",
    "( the neutron and the proton number ) we include a ridge along the line of stability .",
    "the liquid - drop formula above also gives neutron and proton drip lines and the results shown here include all nuclei within the boundaries .",
    "the long range coulomb interaction between different composites can be included in an approximation called the wigner - seitz approximation .",
    "we incorporate this following the scheme set up in @xcite .",
    "the statistical multifragmentation model described above calculates the properties of the collision averaged system that can be approximated by an equilibrium ensemble .",
    "ideally , one would like to measure the properties of excited primary fragments after emission in order to extract information about the collisions and compare directly with the equilibrium predictions of the model .",
    "however , the time scale of a nuclear reaction(@xmath44 ) is much shorter than the time scale for particle detection ( @xmath45 ) . before reaching the detectors , most fragments decay to stable isotopes in their ground states .",
    "thus before any model simulations can be compared to experimental data , it is indispensable to have a model that simulates sequential decays .",
    "a monte carlo technique is employed to follow all decay chains until the resulting products are unable to undergo further decay . for the purposes of the sequential decay calculations",
    "the excited primary fragments generated by the statistical model calculations are taken as the compound nucleus input to the evaporation code .",
    "hence , every primary fragment is decayed as a separate event .",
    "we consider the deexcitation of a primary fragment of mass @xmath46 , charge @xmath47 and temperature @xmath11 . the succseesive particle emission from the hot primary fragments is assumed to be the basic deexcitation mechanism .",
    "for each event of the primary breakup simulation , the entire chain of evaporation and secondary breakup events is monte carlo simulated .",
    "the standard weisskopf evaporation scheme is used to take into account evaporation of nucleons , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath5 .",
    "the decays of particle stable excited states via gamma rays were also taken into account for the sequential decay process and for the calculation of the final ground state yields .",
    "we have also considered fission as a deexcitation channel though for the nuclei of mass @xmath51 100 its role will be quite insignificant .",
    "the process of light particle emission from a compound nucleus is governed by the emission width @xmath52 at which a particle of type @xmath53 is emitted . according to weisskopf s conventional evaporation theory @xcite , the partial decay width for emission of a light particle of type @xmath53",
    "is given by @xmath54    here @xmath55 is the mass of the emitted particle , @xmath56 is its spin degeneracy .",
    "@xmath57 is the particle separation energy which is calculated from the binding energies of the parent nucleus , daughter nucleus and the binding energy of the emitted particle and the liquid drop model is used to calculate the binding energies .",
    "the subscript @xmath53 refers to the emitted particle , @xmath58 refers to the parent nuclei and @xmath59 refers to the residual(daughter ) nuclei .",
    "@xmath60 @xmath1 @xmath61 are the level density parameters of the parent and residual nucleus respectively .",
    "the level density parameter is given by @xmath62 and it connects the excitation energy @xmath63 and temperature @xmath11 through the following relations .",
    "@xmath64    where @xmath65 @xmath1 @xmath66 are the temperatures of the emitting(parent ) and the final(residual ) nucleus respectively .",
    "@xmath67 is the coulomb barrier which is zero for neutral particles and non - zero for charged particles . in order to calculate the coulomb barrier for charged particles of mass @xmath68 we use a touching sphere",
    "approximation@xcite ,    @xmath69    where @xmath70 is taken as 1.44 m .",
    "@xmath71 is the geometrical crosssection ( inverse cross section ) associated with the formation of the compound nucleus(parent ) from the emitted particle and the daughter nucleus and is given by @xmath72 where ,    @xmath73    where @xmath74 = 1.2 fm .    for the emission of giant dipole @xmath75-quanta",
    "we take the formula given by lynn@xcite @xmath76 with @xmath77 with @xmath78 , and @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the position and width of the giant dipole resonance .    for the fission width",
    "we have used the simplified formula of bohr - wheeler given by    @xmath81    where @xmath82 is the fission barrier of the compound nucleus given by@xcite    @xmath83    once the emission widths are known , it is required to establish the emission algorithm which decides whether a particle is being emitted from the compound nucleus .",
    "this is done @xcite by first calculating the ratio @xmath84 where @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 or fission and then performing monte - carlo sampling from a uniformly distributed set of random numbers . in the case that a particle is emitted , the type of the emitted particle is next decided by a monte carlo selection with the weights @xmath88 ( partial widths ) .",
    "the energy of the emitted particle is then obtained by another monte carlo sampling of its energy spectrum .",
    "the energy , mass and charge of the nucleus is adjusted after each emission .",
    "this procedure is followed for each of the primary fragment produced at a fixed temperature and then repeated over a large ensemble and the observables are calculated from the ensemble averages . .",
    "the number and type of particles emitted and the final decay product in each event is registered and are taken into account properly keeping in mind the overall charge and baryon number conservation .",
    "first we will show our calculations for @xmath0 on @xmath3 reaction and @xmath2 on @xmath3 reaction . in the model",
    ", the target imparts a certain amount of energy to the projectile transforming it to a projectile like fragment(plf ) with a temperature .",
    "this excited plf will then expand and form composites during the expansion .",
    "the partioning of the plf into different composites is done by the rules of equilibrium statistical mechanics in a freeze - out volume .",
    "we consider production of different isotopes from the statistical breakup of the dissociating system .",
    "if @xmath89 is the average number(multiplicity ) of composites with @xmath90 neutrons and @xmath91 protons , then the cross - section for this composite is @xmath92 , where c is a constant not calculable from the thermodynamic model .",
    "it depends upon the dynamics that are outside the scope of this model . to be able to compute @xmath89 we need to know the mass and charge of the plf and its temperature .",
    "the source sizes adopted for this calculation are zero order guesses",
    ". it could be sometimes smaller or greater depending on the diffusion from the target . for @xmath2 or @xmath0 on @xmath3 which is a small target the choice of the mass and the charge of the plf is limited",
    ". it can be slightly less than that of the projectile to as large as that of the projectile plus @xmath3 , the last being the case when the much larger projectile swallows the small target and drags it along retaining plf features .",
    "similarly we have some limits on energy imparted(this fixes the temperature ) .",
    "this energy can be small or upto the upper limit .",
    "the upper limit is given by the case of projectile swallowing be and all the energy transforming into internal excitation(no part going into collective flow ) .",
    "in the canonical calculation , the dissociating system is taken to be @xmath93 and for the other reaction the dissociating system is taken to be @xmath94.all composites between drip lines are included as detailed in sec.iia with the highest values of n , z terminating at @xmath27 , @xmath10 .",
    "the temperature is taken to be 5.8 mev for both the reactions .",
    "1 displays the isotopic distribution for z=12(magnesium ) produced from both the the reactions .",
    "the dashed lines correspond to the distributions of the primary fragments while the solid lines correspond to the distributions after sequential decay . as expected , the more neutron rich system with @xmath95 ( right panel ) produces more neutron rich isotopes than the neutron deficient system with @xmath96 ( left panel ) . in all cases ,",
    "the primary distributions are much wider and more neutron rich than the final distributions .",
    "the peak positions of the isotopic distributions of both the primary and the secondary fragments coincide in case of the neutron deficient system as seen from the left panel of the figure . in case of the neutron rich system(right panel )",
    "the peak of the distribution of the secondary fragments has shifted to the left with respect to that of the primary .",
    "the experimental isotopic distributions(solid squares with error bars ) agree much more with the final results obtained after secondary decay than with the primary distributions .",
    "the width and peak position of the isotopic distribution after the secondary decay agrees very well with the experimental data .",
    "the model also successfully reproduces the rapid fall in crosssection for large neutron number .",
    "we will now discuss the results about isoscaling .",
    "it is observed from the experimental data@xcite that the light fragments emitted from the @xmath0 and @xmath2 systems exhibit the linear isoscaling behaviour represented by the equation @xmath97 where the isoscaling ratio @xmath98 is factored into two fugacity terms @xmath5 and @xmath6 , which contain the differences of the chemical potentials for neutrons and protons of the two reaction systems .",
    "@xmath99 refers to the yield of fragment(n , z ) from system 2 which is usually taken to be the neutron - rich one and @xmath100 refers to the same from system 1 .",
    "c is a normalization factor of the isoscaling ratio .",
    "it is observed from our model that both the primary as well as the secondary fragments exhibit isoscaling .",
    "2 shows the isoscaling results for ni on be system for the primary fragments . the ratio @xmath101 is plotted as function of the neutron number from z = 6 to z= 13 in the left panel whereas the right panel displays the ratio as function of the proton number z from n=8 to n=15 .",
    "it is seen that the primary fragments exhibit very well the linear isoscaling behaviour for the lighter fragments over a wide range of isotopes and isotones .",
    "the lines in the figures are the best fits of the calculated @xmath101 ratios(open triangles ) to eq.15 .",
    "they are essentially linear and parallel on the semi log plot .",
    "3 displays the isoscaling results for the secondary fragments .",
    "the open triangles are the results obatined from our model while the solid squares with the error bars are the experimental ratios .",
    "we have shown the isoscaling results for the even z and odd z isotopes in two separate panels for the sake of clarity .",
    "while comparing with the results of the primary fragments in fig 2 , it is evident that the isoscaling is valid for a limited range of isotopes for the secondary fragments as compared to the primary ones .",
    "when the isotopes away from the valley of stable nuclei are considered , the trends for the secondary fragments are not as clearly consistent with the isoscaling law as are the trends of the primary distribution .",
    "one can conclude from this that isoscaling is approximately valid in the case of the secondary fragments .",
    "the lines in the figures are the best fits of the calculated @xmath101 ratios which agree closely with the experimental data .",
    "the temperature required to reproduce isoscaling data with the primary fragments is about 8 mev@xcite whereas that required for the secondary fragments is 5.8 mev .",
    "this decrease was already predicted in one of our earlier papers@xcite in sec.9 . it has also been found out by ono et al.@xcite that the effect of secondary decay is to decrease the isoscaling parameter @xmath5 by about @xmath102 .",
    "this is indeed what emerges from our calculations after including secondary decay code with the canonical model though the amount of reduction is less as compared to the dynamical model .",
    "tha value of @xmath5 as obtained from the fits of the primary fragments ( left panel of fig .",
    "2 ) is 0.713 whereas that obtained from the secondary fragments is 0.580 which is much closer to the experimentally obtained value for @xmath5@xcite equal to 0.566 .    in fig .",
    "4 we have also plotted the isoscaling ratios for different neutron number values as function of the proton number z and thereby calculated the other isoscaling parameter @xmath6 from them . the value of @xmath6 as obatined from the linear fits of the primary fragments ( right panel of fig .",
    "2 ) is -0.849 . for the secondary fragments ,",
    "the value of @xmath6 from our model is -0.634 whereas the experimentally obtained value is -0.621 .",
    "the value of @xmath6 also decreases in the case of secondary from the primary ones as in the case of @xmath5 .",
    "the results obtained after the sequential decay matches very well with the experimental ratios . as for the isotopes in fig 3 , for the isotones also it is seen that the linear isoscaling is valid for a limited range in case of secondary fragments as compared to the primary ones(right panel of fig.2 ) .",
    "we now turn to the case where the target is @xmath4 .",
    "one can consider the extreme limit which is target independence and by which we mean that @xmath27 , @xmath10 refers to simply to the case where just the projectile is the disintegrating system .",
    "the more likely scenario where some matter has diffused to or from the target has many possibilities . in principle",
    ", the target could shear away some material from the projectile leaving a plf which is a fraction of the projectile . for a peripheral collision",
    "this is less likely than the alternative of the projectile picking up part of nuclear matter from the tail region of the much larger target .",
    "the amount of nuclear matter curved out of ta will be small(for the disintegrating system to retain plf characteristics ) but other than that not much can be said and an integration over the different possibilities might be essential . keeping this limitation in mind , we compared with different possible scenarios and the case with projectile plus 10 neutrons and 8 protons from the target , i.e ,",
    "projectile + @xmath103 yielded the best results .",
    "it is also seen that target independence gives worse results than this case .",
    "the agreement of our model calculations with experimental data is pretty good in this case .",
    "the temperature used for this reaction is 6.2 mev .",
    "fig . 5 and fig .",
    "6 are similar to fig .",
