    "<S> thus , the initially multidimensional tunneling problem is now reduced to a textbook one - dimensional problem . </S>",
    "<S> next , we expand @xmath114 and @xmath115 in terms of the two sets of plasmon wave functions that follow from the harmonic approximation of @xmath108 about @xmath116 and @xmath117 , respectively . this resolves the third difficulty mentioned above . from the expansion , we arrive at @xmath118 ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath119/(n-1)$ ] , and @xmath120\\ ] ] is a phase factor ( defined up to a global phase ) that arises from eq .  </S>",

    "<S> a simplified version of the procedure described above can be applied to recover  @xcite the ground - state tunneling amplitude , @xmath121 .    with no induced charges , </S>",
    "<S> the tunneling amplitudes are sensitive to the total charge @xmath20 . </S>",

    "<S> thus , destructive interference caused by @xmath126 protects a 2-fold degenerate crossing point . </S>",
    "<S> the one - plasmon energy spectrum remains highly degenerate at any @xmath130 .    in reality , there are induced charges and there is no control over them  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> below we regard @xmath24 as independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )  random variables , and model them by gaussian probability density functions ( pdf ) with mean zero and standard deviation @xmath131 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , @xmath132 and the tunneling amplitudes become random variables . for broad distributions ( @xmath133 ) , the variables @xmath132 are approximately i.i.d .  with uniformly distributed phase , and </S>",
    "<S> the tunneling amplitudes become insensitive to the value of @xmath20 .    , according to eq .  </S>",

    "<S> inverting the unitary transformation that approximately diagonalizes @xmath150 ( which turns out to diagonalize @xmath73 as well ) , and applying it onto the plasmon states @xmath151 , we obtain @xmath106 modes ( @xmath39 , if @xmath144 ) that are almost perfectly localized in space . </S>",

    "<S> the typical energy separation between neighboring plasmon modes exceeds @xmath153 , and the hybridization due to phase slips is restricted to subspaces of four - fold degenerate modes ( two pcs and two plasmon modes @xmath51 and @xmath155 ) . as long as @xmath156 , the tunneling amplitudes between these four levels can be found by the method developed above , but with a set of plasmon modes diagonalizing eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : unperturbedhamiltonian ] ) for @xmath46 . in this case too , tunneling in presence of random induced charges removes all degeneracies . yet , unlike for @xmath49 , plasmons remain delocalized , thus weakening the aharonov - casher effect . in summary , we have presented a theory for quantum phase slips in a closed josephson junction array in a one - plasmon excited state . </S>",
    "<S> phase slips hybridize different one - plasmon and persistent current states , and lead to a typically non - degenerate energy spectrum that is sensitive to gate - induced charges . </S>",
    "<S> this sensitivity is a signature of the aharonov - casher effect . </S>",
