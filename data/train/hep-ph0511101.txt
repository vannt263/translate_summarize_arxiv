    "our knowledge about the early phase of a heavy ion collision , is still incomplete .",
    "hydrodynamic calculations compared with data collected at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) suggest a rather early thermalization time @xmath0 fm/@xmath1 , at which a deconfined quark gluon plasma is created @xcite . after the time @xmath2 ideal hydrodynamics delivers a successful description of the dynamics of the fireball .",
    "the initial conditions for the hydrodynamic evolution however remain obscure and are often subject to an educated guess .    here",
    "we propose a simple model for the initial state that focuses on two important questions : how much energy is deposited in the fireball between the receding nuclei , and how is this energy distributed in space - time at an early time @xmath2 ?",
    "the model uses three simple ingredients : an initial distribution of color sources in the colliding nuclei , ( ii ) the evolution of a classical mclerran - venugopalan gluon field , ( iii ) energy - momentum conservation .",
    "let us choose a momentum scale @xmath3 ( which should be much larger than @xmath4 ) .",
    "we divide gluon production into hard modes ( hard processes with transverse momentum @xmath5 ) and soft modes ( modes of the gluon field with @xmath6 ) .",
    "hard modes can be rigorously treated within perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) and implemented in a parton cascade . for the soft modes we take guidance from the mclerran - venugopalan ( mv ) model and describe them by classical solutions to the yang - mills equation @xmath7 = j^\\nu$ ] and the continuity equation @xmath8 = 0 $ ] @xcite . in the mv model",
    "the field is generated by local color fluctuations in the nuclei which are otherwise color neutral .    in our case",
    "the classical @xmath9 current @xmath10 contains these primordial color distributions @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "they are infinitely thin sheets of charge propagating with the speed of light along the light cone from @xmath13 to @xmath14 .",
    "hard processes take place on very short time scales @xmath15 .",
    "they happen almost instantaneous for the soft fields",
    ". for consistency color charges induced by hard processes have to be taken into account as additional sources of the soft gluon field , which are switched on at @xmath14 .",
    "this is similar to a color ionization process : a parton with a certain color is participating in a hard process , leaving a hole with the corresponding anticolor .",
    "the parton can instead be found in the forward light cone .",
    "therefore @xmath10 contains modified color distributions @xmath16 and @xmath17 propagating on the light cone from @xmath14 to @xmath18 and a charge @xmath19 in the forward light cone .",
    "here we shall not discuss the most general case , but demonstrate the basic features of the model for the simple case of a boost invariant current . in an axial gauge , defined by the condition @xmath20 for the gauge potential @xmath21 , we consider the current @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) and @xmath24,\\ ] ] with @xmath25 , see fig .  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "we solve the yang - mills equations for small times @xmath26 .",
    "causality ensures that only charges with a transverse distance less than @xmath27 can interact during this time .",
    "this suggests to discretize the charge distributions in the transverse plane .",
    "we use a rectangular grid of size @xmath28 for both nuclei . in each bin the classical charge with an effective size @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) is put at the center . for @xmath31 only the interaction of charges in the two nuclei which are opposite to each other ( i.e.  go through each other at the time of overlap , @xmath14 ) have to be taken into account . the fireball between the receding nuclei",
    "is then described by a set of parallel tubes of width @xmath28 with the bins of color charges at both ends ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) .     and @xmath32.,width=226 ]     and @xmath32.,width=321 ]    in each bin in the nuclei",
    "the color charges of the partons are described by an effective classical color charge .",
    "it was shown that this classical charge is given by a random walk in @xmath9 space @xcite .",
    "the probability distribution for the classical charge @xmath33 is given by @xmath34 where the length @xmath35 of the random walk is determined by the number of quarks , antiquarks and gluons as @xmath36 .",
    "the yang - mills equations can now be solved for each tube using classical charges @xmath37 and @xmath32 as sources in the bins on either side .",
    "we solve them to all orders in the coupling constant @xmath38 using an expansion in powers of @xmath39 . at small times",
    "the dominating field component is the longitudinal chromoelectric field @xmath40 in the tube .",
    "it has a finite value for @xmath41 , while the transverse chromoelectric and magnetic fields @xmath42 vanish initially and then increase linearly at early times .",
    "the longitudinal chromomagnetic field @xmath43 is zero at least up to order @xmath44 .",
    "we have solved the field equations up to order @xmath44 for the longitudinal fields and up to order @xmath45 for the transverse fields .",
    "thus at early times the field between the receding nuclei is analogous to a capacitor as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the longitudinal chromoelectric field will slow down the charges .",
    "the trajectory of each bin of partons for @xmath46 can be calculated to lowest order by assuming that it initially travels with the rapidity @xmath47 of the beam .",
    "we can follow the trajectory to where it intersects the hypersurface @xmath48 at space - time rapidities @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "these values limit the longitudinal extent of the tube with the gluon field or plasma ( see fig .  [ fig:3 ] ) .    at times",
    "@xmath51 the fields of neighboring tubes start to overlap .",
    "we add them coherently , and calculate the resulting energy - momentum tensor @xmath52 from the gluon field .",
    "it turns out that the energy - momentum tensor can be parameterized in the following way : @xmath53 where @xmath21 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are functions of time @xmath26 and the transverse coordinate @xmath58 but independent of space - time rapidity @xmath59 . at early times",
    "they behave like @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 respectively , while the functions @xmath56 and @xmath57 will not play any further role . using the expansion in @xmath26 for the gluon field as above we can ensure that @xmath63 .",
    "we can now match this field tensor with the tensor of the plasma phase , @xmath64 characterized by a local energy density @xmath65 , pressure @xmath66 and a 4-velocity @xmath67 with longitudinal and transverse flow @xmath68 and @xmath69 . without detailed knowledge of the decay and thermalization of the gluon field",
    "we can still make use of the fact that @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the total energy momentum tensor of the fireball which is equal to @xmath52 up to some time before the thermalization time @xmath2 and equal to @xmath72 after that .",
    "here we discuss the case of an instantaneous matching for which @xmath73 .",
    "energy - momentum conservation implies a set of equations for the plasma : @xmath74 these equations fix transverse flow to be in the direction of @xmath75 .",
    "we also note that the longitudinal flow leads to a boost - invariant scenario where rapidity @xmath76 is equal to @xmath59 up to the limiting values @xmath77 .",
    "of course this is a consequence of the boost - invariant charge distribution in this example .",
    "we need another equation to unambiguously determine the magnitude of @xmath78 , @xmath66 and @xmath65",
    ". this can be the equation of state which is used for the hydrodynamic evolution for @xmath79 .",
    "e.g.  an ideal gas equation of state would lead to @xmath80 .     in the transverse plane which determines the radial flow in the plasma phase.,width=283 ]     in the transverse plane which determines the radial flow in the plasma phase.,width=264 ]",
    "to summarize , we introduce a model for the early phase of a heavy ion collision that can be used to estimate how much energy is deposited by the production of gluon fields and how the energy is distributed once the system thermalizes . in this model",
    "it is natural to have transverse flow and also elliptic flow already at the beginning of the plasma phase .",
    "flow originates from the transverse energy flow @xmath81 of the early gluon phase , see fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "preliminary results have been obtained using a boost invariant charge distribution in the nuclei .",
    "some of the details remain to be carried out in more detail . in particular",
    "we aim for a consistent implementation of hard processes which minimizes the dependence of the final results on the hard scale @xmath3 .",
