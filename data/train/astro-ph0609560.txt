    "clusters of galaxies are the most massive gravitationally bound structures in the universe , and are thought to grow into larger systems through complex interactions between smaller systems . signatures of such merging events may manifest themselves in non - gaussian velocity distributions of member galaxies , temperature and density inhomogeneities in the intracluster medium ( icm ) , and bulk motions of the icm . indeed",
    ", numerical simulations predict the existence of bulk icm flows with a substantial fraction of the virial velocity ( @xmath4 for rich clusters ) , lasting several gyr after each merger event ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , measurements of the icm velocity structure provide very important information with which to understand the cluster dynamics .",
    "if the icm has a significant bulk velocity compared to its thermal velocity , the associated non - thermal pressure would endanger the assumption of hydrostatic icm equilibrium , which is usually assumed in deriving the total gravitating mass in a cluster .",
    "for example , the factor 23 discrepancy between the x - ray and lensing mass estimations in some objects ( e.g. , @xcite ) could be due to this effect .",
    "therefore , the presence / absence of icm bulk motion has a great impact on the cluster studies , including their mass estimates and cosmological applications .",
    "we are thus encouraged to observationally constrain the icm motion .",
    "such an attempt may be carried out by examining x - ray emission lines from heavy elements for doppler shifts and broadenings ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or by utilizing kinetic sunyaev - zeldovich effects in the radio wavebands ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for the former method , x - ray spectroscopy of the emission lines from heavy ions , particularly the @xmath5  kev k - lines from helium - like iron atoms , provides the most sensitive way of studying such icm motions . by observing x - ray spectra in the 0.58.5 kev range from the core regions of the centaurus cluster ( abell  3526 ) with the chandra acis",
    ", @xcite recently reported on a large velocity gradient of @xmath6 over a spatial scale of 100  kpc , reconfirming their previous asca measurements @xcite .",
    "however , their results might still be subject to residual uncertainties arising from temporal and intrachip gain variability , requiring an independent cross confirmation . since a bulk velocity of @xmath7 along the line of sight translates to a shift in the he - like fe - k line energy of @xmath8  ev , we need not only sufficient photon statistics and good energy resolution , but also precise instrumental gain calibrations with an accuracy better than @xmath9 ev ( or @xmath10 ) .",
    "the centaurus cluster ( abell  3526 ) , at the redshift of @xmath11 , is a nearby x - ray bright cluster of galaxies , hosting the cd galaxy ngc  4696 .",
    "it has been extensively studied at various wavelengths .",
    "@xcite found a bimodal velocity distribution of galaxies , corresponding to the main cluster ( cen  30 ) centered on ngc  4696 , and a subcluster ( cen  45 ) centered on ngc  4709 , with a velocity difference of @xmath12 .",
    "they hence argued that cen  30 is currently accreting cen  45 .",
    "the x - ray measured icm temperature is @xmath13  kev in outer regions , and decreases toward the center to @xmath14  kev ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although the central part of this cluster is relatively relaxed ( e.g. , @xcite ) , at larger radii the temperature maps derived with asca reveal a hot spot coincident with cen  45 @xcite , supporting the idea that there is a past or on - going merger episode .",
    "the central region is very rich in metals , with a large abundance gradient @xcite .",
    "emitting very intense fe - k emission lines , the central region of the centaurus cluster provides an excellent opportunity for a study of icm bulk - motion .    in this paper , we present an analysis of the bulk velocity of the gas over the central 240 kpc of the centaurus cluster , conducted with the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ; @xcite ) on board the suzaku satellite @xcite .",
    "the xis has an excellent sensitivity at the iron k - line energies , and a very low background .",
    "in addition , the current accuracy of the xis in - orbit calibration is already high enough to enable us to make meaningful searches for possible icm bulk motions . the suzaku x - ray telescope ( xrt ; @xcite ) has a spatial resolution of @xmath15 ( half power diameter ; hpd ) , allowing us to study spatial velocity variations on reasonable scales ( @xmath16a few arcminutes ) .",
    "we therefore test the previously claimed large velocity gradient near the cluster center .    throughout this paper",
    "we adopt @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 ; @xmath20 corresponds to 13.5  kpc at the cluster redshift of @xmath11 .",
    "the quoted statistical errors refer to 68% confidence ranges , unless otherwise stated .",
    "three pointed observations of the centaurus cluster were conducted between 2005 december 2729 , in the suzaku phase - i period : one centered on the cd galaxy , ngc  4696 , and the other two ( offset1 and offset2 ) offset by @xmath21 and @xmath22 in declination , respectively .",
    "the details of the observations is given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the two onboard instruments , the xis and the hard x - ray detector ( hxd ; @xcite ) , were operated in their normal modes during the observations .",
    "the xis consists of four x - ray sensitive ccd cameras : three front - illuminated ( fi ) ccds and one back - illuminated ( bi ) ccd . in the present paper ,",
    "we use data from the three fi - chip cameras ( xis0 , 2 , and 3 ) , since they have higher sensitivities as well as lower backgrounds at the iron - k line energies , compared to the bi - chip camera ( xis1 ) . as shown in figure  [ fig1 ] ,",
    "the extended icm emission was clearly detected , the center of which @xmath23 in j2000 coordinates , is consistent within @xmath24 of the position of ngc  4696 .    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     the velocity difference derived from the xis spectra .",
    "the @xmath25% statistical errors and ( the 68% systematic errors ) are quoted . the velocity difference and the @xmath26 error derived from the chandra acis spectra @xcite .    as to ( 1 ) , the model fitting to the xis spectra has given @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , resulting in a negative value for the redshift difference @xmath29 , or the velocity difference , @xmath30 . because peak- and peak+ are close to each other , the intrachip gain difference between them is considered to be smaller than our canonical value , @xmath31 .",
    "nevertheless , to be conservative , we multiplied this by @xmath32 , to obtain @xmath33 as our systematic error on the velocity difference .",
    "the above results then imply that the velocity difference between peak- and peak+ does not significantly exceed the calibration uncertainty of @xmath34 .",
    "if we further sum the systematic and statistical errors in quadrature , the 90% confidence range becomes @xmath35 , which is inconsistent with the chandra measurement of @xmath36 .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ tab2 ] .    as to ( 2 ) , a similar analysis of the suzaku xis data has given the redshifts of the r-2 and r+3 regions as @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the redshift and velocity differences become @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively ( table  [ tab2 ] ) . the allowed 90% range then becomes @xmath41 , which again excludes the chandra measurement of @xmath42 between r-2 and r+3 .",
    "then , can we reconcile the apparently conflicting chandra ( plus asca ) and suzaku results ?",
    "one possibility is that the much wider psf of the suzaku xrt , compared to that of chandra , has diluted the velocity gradient . to examine the effect",
    ", we again executed the xissim simulation of the xis spectra for peak- and peak+ , simply assuming that the gas bulk motion exists only in those two regions and that they have the velocity difference close to the 90% lower limit of the chandra result , @xmath43 ; other regions in the xis field of view are assumed to have no bulk motion , with @xmath0 .",
    "the model fit to the two simulated spectra indicates that the suzaku xis should observe a velocity difference of @xmath44 , as a result of the telescope resolution which reduce the velocity difference by a factor of @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , the chandra measurement may be brought to be marginally consistent with the present suzaku upper limit . as to ( 2 ) , the same simulation indicates that the 90% lower - limit value of @xmath46 between r-2 and r+3 based on the chandra report will be reduced to @xmath47 in the xis data after smeared by the psf .",
    "this is consistent with the 90% upper limit set by suzaku , @xmath48 .    in this way",
    ", the positive @xmath42 reported by @xcite for the two pairs of regions can be tentatively made consistent with the negative @xmath42 we measured .",
    "however , this was possible by invoking rather extreme assumptions ; namely , to employ the chandra lower limit and the suzaku upper limit on @xmath42 , and to assume that the icm bulk motion is localized to the small regions of @xmath49  kpc",
    ".    a comparison of the present results with the reported asca measurement @xcite may give additional clues .",
    "the suzaku xrt @xcite is an improved version over its predecessor onboard asca .",
    "similarly , the suzaku xis is an improved instrument based on the sis experiment onboard asca . as compared with the xrt+sis combination onboard asca",
    ", the xrt+xis of suzaku hence has a @xmath50 times better psf , a @xmath51 times larger effective area ( at 7 kev ; two sis sensors versus three xis cameras ) .",
    "furthermore , the energy scale of the suzaku xis has been better calibrated @xcite than the asca sis which was the first single - photon detection ccd used in cosmic x - ray observations .",
    "therefore , any doppler shifts in the fe - k line detectable by asca would be detected by suzaku with a much higher significance ( unless the exposure is too short ) .    from these considerations , we conclude that it is rather difficult to reconcile the the present results with the chandra ( plus asca ) measurements .",
    "additional information will be obtained by analyzing a longer chandra dataset on the centaurus cluster . @xcite .",
    "utilizing the fe - k@xmath52 line , we obtained a 90% upper limit on the velocity difference of @xmath53 between any pair of regions within the xis field of view , separated typically by @xmath54  kpc or more .",
    "this gives a tighter constraint on the icm bulk motion than was suggested by previous reports .",
    "since the ion sound velocity in the icm is @xmath55 for a temperature of @xmath56  kev , our results imply that the line - of - sight velocity of the icm bulk motion , if any , does not largely exceed the sound velocity .",
    "in other words , the ram pressure associated with the icm bulk motion is at most comparable to the thermal icm pressure , thus approximately validating the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium in calculating the cluster mass . of course",
    ", we can probe the gas motion only along the line of sight , and hence we need to assume 3-dimensional velocity structures in order to quantitatively utilize the present upper limits .    as an elementary exercise , below we evaluate the upper limit on rotational motion assuming for simplicity that the gas is rigidly rotating at a typical circular velocity of @xmath57 , and derive its quantitative effect on cluster mass estimation .",
    "assuming an approximate spherical symmetry , and including the centrifugal force , the balance against the gravitational pull at a radius @xmath58 on the rotational equatorial plane then becomes @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the cluster mass interior to radius @xmath58 , @xmath61 is the gas density , @xmath62 is the icm pressure , and @xmath63 is the fraction of the icm that is rotating ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "the gas density profile of the centaurus cluster roughly follows @xmath65 within the central @xmath66 region , assuming the double-@xmath67 model @xcite .",
    "together with the assumption @xmath68 , this yields @xmath69 and hence the second term on the right - hand side of equation  [ eq1 ] can be rewritten as @xmath70 equation  [ eq1 ] then becomes @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the ratio of the kinetic energy due to rotational motion to the thermal energy .",
    "thus , the total mass should be higher than the hydrostatic mass by a factor of @xmath73 , because of the presence of additional pressure support .    at a typical radius of @xmath74  kpc , the rotational velocity is @xmath75 , yielding @xmath76 .",
    "considering an inclination angle @xmath77 of the rotation axis and the mean @xmath78 factor , @xmath79 , the rotational velocity is @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "therefore cluster mass estimation with the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium is justified within a factor of @xmath82 . in order to put a stronger constraint on the cluster mass to compare with other techniques ( particularly gravitational lensing ) , a two - fold improvement on the energy - scale calibration",
    "is necessary .",
    "the velocity structure in the cluster can also be studied by analyzing the x - ray line widths for turbulent doppler broadening of the x - ray emission lines .",
    "the iron ions provide the best tracers of this effect , because the broadening due to a turbulent velocity , @xmath83 , on the order of @xmath84 , can exceed their thermal broadening ( @xmath85  ev ) by several times @xcite . however , considering the energy resolution of the fi ccds , 160  ev ( fwhm ) or 70  ev ( gaussian @xmath26 ) , what can be done with the present data is at most to examine the observed fe - k line width for possible broadening beyond the instrumental energy resolution and its intrinsic line width ( @xmath86  ev for @xmath56  kev ) . in order to carry out this search under the highest statistics",
    ", we again fitted the xis0+xis2+xis3 spectrum from the central @xmath87 region ( analyzed in  [ subsec : analysis_large ] ) with the apec plus three gaussian model .",
    "here we assumed that the gas has no bulk velocity , and fixed the centroid of the he - like k@xmath52 line to @xmath88  kev . as a result",
    ", the gaussian width has been obtained as @xmath89  ev .    since the degradation of the energy resolution with time is not currently implemented in the xis response matrix @xcite ,",
    "the fitted gaussian width is expressed by @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the width of the mn - k@xmath52 calibration line as mentioned before , and the average of the three fi ccds gives @xmath92  ev . thus , the measured width is consistent with that expected from the instrumental and intrinsic widths , @xmath93  ev , where the intrinsic width @xmath94 includes also the thermal doppler although it is negligibly small ( @xmath95  ev ) in the energy range of interest .",
    "the turbulent broadening is then loosely constrained as @xmath96 ( 90% confidence ) .",
    "although @xmath94 significantly increases below a temperature of 2  kev , it is within the range of @xmath97 as long as @xmath98 , and does not significantly affect the above discussion .",
    "the derived limit on @xmath99 is consistent with a stronger constraint , @xmath100 , derived by an argument that strong turbulence would smear out , via diffusion , the observed abundance gradient in the central 100  kpc of the cluster @xcite .",
    "observations of resonance scattering of the x - ray emission lines will provide another way to constrain the icm turbulent motion .",
    "this is , however , beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "based on suzaku xis observations of the centaurus cluster , we investigated the bulk motion in the intracluster medium to constrain its dynamical state .",
    "the high sensitivity and accurate calibration of the xis sensors enabled us to study positional dependence of the iron - k line energy on a 50  kpc scale , particularly over the central @xmath101 region , as well as on a @xmath102  kpc scale over a diameter of 460  kpc .",
    "the results show that there is no significant velocity gradient , within the present calibration uncertainty of @xmath103 , suggesting that the bulk velocity does not largely exceed the thermal velocity of the gas .",
    "the 90% upper limit on the velocity separation between a pair of regions is @xmath104 , providing a tighter constraint than the previous observations by a factor of @xmath85 .",
    "the present result can not be easily reconciled with the previous chandra observations which reported the large velocity gradients in the two pairs of rectangular regions near the cluster core .",
    "the mean redshift of the icm is determined to be @xmath3 , in agreement with the optical redshift of the cluster within the calibrational error . with the upper limit on the velocity difference , the pressure support due to hypothetical rotational motion may not alter the cluster mass estimate under the hydrostatic assumption by more than a factor of @xmath105 .",
