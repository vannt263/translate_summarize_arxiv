    "the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) waves and oscillations in the solar and probably in the stellar atmospheres are assumed to be generated by coupling of complex magnetic field and plasma .",
    "these mhd waves and oscillations are one of the important candidates for heating the solar / stellar coronae and accelerating the supersonic winds . in the sun ,",
    "magnetically structured flaring loops , anchored into the photosphere , exhibit various kinds of mhd oscillations ( e.g. fast sausage , kink and slow acoustic oscillations ) .",
    "the idea of exploiting such observed oscillations as a diagnostic tool for deducing physical parameters of the coronal plasma was first suggested by roberts et al .",
    "wave and oscillatory activity of the solar corona is now well observed with modern imaging and spectral instruments ( e.g. instruments on - board /it soho , trace , hinode and norh ) in the visible , euv , x - ray and radio bands , and interpreted in terms of mhd wave theory ( nakariakov & verwichte 2005 ) .",
    "stellar mhd seismology is also a new developing tool to deduce the physical properties of the atmosphere of magnetically active stars , and it is based on the analogy of the solar coronal seismology ( nakariakov 2007 ) . the first stellar x - ray flare oscillations in at mic have been reported by mitra - kraev et al .",

    "( 1992 ) have also found the oscillations on the scale of few minutes and interpreted as a transient oscillations in the stellar loops . in this letter , we find the observational signature of the fast kink oscillations in the magnetically active star @xmath0 boo ( v = 4.55 mag ) .",
    "in the case of solar corona , such type of modes are important to probe the local plasma conditions ( e.g. , van doorsselaere et al .",
    "therefore , such modes may also be useful to diagnose the stellar coronae .",

    "the x - ray light curve of @xmath0 boo is shown in figure [ fig : lc ] , where flare regions are represented by f1 and f2 , and the quiescent state is represented by q. the light curve was binned with 40s . in the x - ray light curve of @xmath0",
    "boo , a period of heightened coronal emission u was identified after the flare f2 , where the average flux was 1.8 times more than the quiescent state .",
    "we have chosen the u region for our wavelet and periodogram analyses because of the stable evolution of the integrated 0.3 - 10 kev light curve after the flare f2 . to study the emission in the u regions only , we fitted the spectral data using 1-temperature plasma model apec ( smith et al .",
    "2001 ) , with the quiescent emission taken into account by including its best - fit 2-temperature model as a frozen background contribution .",

    "line fluxes and positions were measured using the xspec package by fitting simultaneously the rgs1 and rgs2 spectra with a sum of narrow gaussian emission lines convolved with the response matrices of the rgs instruments .",
    "the continuum emission was described using bremstrahlung models at the temperatures of the plasma components inferred from the analysis of epic - mos1 data .",

    "@xmath47 ( = 3.16 counts / s ) and @xmath48 ( = 1.24 counts / s ) are count rate at the peak of the flare and the count rate during the quiescent state , respectively . using this approach ,",

    "the values of @xmath43(=9885 s ) , @xmath44 (= 3351 s ) , and @xmath45 ( = 13.3 mk ) are taken from pandey & singh ( 2008 ) .",
    "given an estimate of two measured quantities , the emission measure ( em ) and the decay time scale of the flare ( @xmath43 ) haisch s approach ( haisch 1983 ) leads to the following expression for the loop length ( @xmath28 )    @xmath50    using this approach , we obtained a loop length of @xmath51 cm .",

    "the flaring activity may be the possible mechanism of the generation of such oscillations in the stellar loops .",
    "recently , cooper et al . ( 2003 ) have found that the transverse kink modes of fast magneto - acoustic waves may modulate the emission observable with imaging telescopes despite their incompressible nature .",
    "this is possible only when the axis of an oscillating loop is not orientated perpendicular to the observer s line of sight .",
    "resonant absorption is the most efficient mechanism theorized for the damping of a kink mode in which energy of the mode is transferred to the localized alfvnic oscillations of the inhomogeneous layers at the loop boundary ( lee & roberts 1986 ) .",
    "intensity oscillations due to the fast - kink mode of magneto - acoustic waves do not show any decay of the amplitude during the initial 250 minutes in the post - flare phase observations of @xmath0 boo .",
    "this is probably due to an impulsive driver , which forces such kind of oscillations and dominates over the dissipative processes during the flare f2 of @xmath0 boo .    in conclusion , we report the first observational evidence of fundamental fast - kink oscillations in stellar loops during a post - flare phase of heightened emission in the cool active star @xmath0 boo .",
    "these oscillations are a unique tool for the estimation of several key parameters of coronae , which are not directly measurable , e.g. , the magnetic field",
    ". some of the seismological techniques developed for the solar corona , e.g. , based upon the ratio of the periods of kink modes , do not require the spatial resolution , and hence can be applied to estimate the density scale heights of the stellar coronae .",
    "therefore , based on the solar analogy , such observations may shed new lights on the dynamics of the magnetically structured stellar coronae and its local plasma conditions .",
    "however , a future multiwavelength observational search is required to investigate various kinds of mhd modes to probe the local conditions of plasma in magnetically active stars .",
