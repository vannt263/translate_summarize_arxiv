    "cataclysmic variable stars ( cvs ) are semi - detached interacting binaries , in which a white dwarf accretes from a low - mass , approximately main - sequence companion star .",
    "cvs typically have orbital periods ( @xmath1 ) of hours .",
    "mass transfer is caused by orbital angular momentum loss , and usually leads to the formation of an accretion disc .",
    "a comprehensive review of cvs may be found in @xcite .    in about 20% of cvs in the @xcite catalogue",
    ", the white dwarf has a magnetic field sufficiently strong either to prevent the formation of a disc entirely , or at least disrupt it to a significant extent .",
    "these are the magnetic cvs , and they are divided into two sub - types , namely polars and intermediate polars ( ips ) .",
    "polars show strong circular and linear polarization modulated at @xmath1 ( implying that the white dwarf rotation is synchronized with the binary orbit ) , while ips are characterized by very stable pulsations , at periods @xmath2 in their x - ray and/or optical light curves .",
    "reviews of polars and ips are given by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the distinction between the observational properties of polars and ips is explained by a combination of white dwarf magnetic field strength and accretion rate , with polars having stronger magnetic fields and lower mass transfer rates ( @xmath3 ) than ips .",
    "although technically the defining characteristic of a polar is white dwarf spin - orbit synchronism , several polars in fact rotate slightly asynchronously ( see e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the degree of asynchronism in these systems is small  the white dwarf spin period ( @xmath4 ) and @xmath1 differ by only @xmath5%and they will attain spin - orbit synchronism on a short time - scale ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "ips are modelled as systems in which accretion is magnetically channelled from the inner edge of a truncated disc , onto a rapidly rotating white dwarf ( see e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the defining short - period photometric pulsations are then identified with the rotation cycle of the white dwarf .",
    "it is not uncommon for the dominant optical frequency to differ from the x - ray frequency ; in those cases , the x - ray signal is believed to be the white dwarf spin frequency ( @xmath6 ) , and the optical frequency is most often @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the orbital frequency ( i.e. , the optical modulation arises from reprocessing of the anisotropic x - ray flux by a structure fixed in the reference frame rotating with the binary ; e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "other ` orbital side bands ' , e.g.  @xmath9 , can also be produced , and have been detected in some ips ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "most ips have harder x - ray spectra than polars , but both polars and ips typically have large x - ray to optical flux ratios compared to non - magnetic cvs ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "high excitation lines , such as heii@xmath104686 , are also usually prominent in the optical spectra of magnetic cvs .",
    "the _ integral _ ibis / isgri soft gamma - ray survey has for the first time systematically imaged a large fraction of the sky at energies above 20 kev ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "roughly 5% of sources detected in this survey are cvs , and a large fraction of these is made up of intrinsically rare systems . specifically , 2 _ integral _ cvs are asynchronous polars ( there are only 6 known ) , and roughly half are ips .",
    "overviews of the cv sample constructed from observations in this band may be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "although _ integral _ is certainly detecting preferentially rare and interesting cvs , there is little information available on most of the systems that were unknown before their detection in this band .",
    "several of the cvs discovered by _",
    "integral _ have been demonstrated to be ips ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , but ip classifications are suggested for many more , on the basis of data that can not cleanly distinguish ips from other types of cvs . in order to provide more reliable classifications , follow - up observations in the optical or softer x - ray bands are needed .",
