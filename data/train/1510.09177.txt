    "synthesis and characterization of atomically abrupt transition metal oxide ( tmo ) heterostructures have revealed a broad platform of unanticipated functionalities with potential to enhance next generation electronics and spintronics capabilities by controlling charge , spin , orbital , and lattice degrees of freedom at the nanoscale.@xcite the earlier focus on perovskite materials with the ( 001 ) growth orientation - prominent examples here being e.g. the interface between laalo@xmath2 and srtio@xmath2 ( lao / sto)@xcite or nickelate superlattices @xcite - has recently been extended to the ( 111 ) orientation.@xcite in the latter , two triangular bo@xmath6 sublattices form a buckled honeycomb lattice , topologically equivalent to graphene .",
    "the honeycomb lattice itself introduces exotic possibilities : considering an alternating , next nearest neighbor ( nnn ) _ imaginary _ hopping amplitude , haldane obtained a quantum spin hall ( qsh ) system without explicit external field.@xcite in the kane - mele elucidation@xcite of the honeycomb lattice , topological behavior originated from spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) entanglement of band character .",

    "these specific models are , however , challenging to realize in real materials , and viable chern insulators remain to be realized .    compared to graphene and common topological insulators ( ti ) , tmos possess not only larger band gaps , but offer an enormously richer palette of possibilities due to several distinctive features : correlated electron behavior causing spin , charge , and orbital instabilities , multi - orbital configurations combined with relativistic effects , viz .",
    "spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) .",
    "below we demonstrate that the interplay of strong interactions and soc effects produce specific spin - fermion systems as candidates for qsh or qah systems in the @xmath5 ( 111 ) bilayers with buckled honeycomb lattice .",
    "the idea of constructing a ( 111 ) bilayer from perovskite tmo was introduced by xiao _",

    "besides examples for @xmath8 systems@xcite , dft studies including strong local interaction effects ( see below ) have recently predicted a dirac - point fermi surface for sto(111)@xcite and lno(111 ) bilayers , quantum confined within lao.@xcite in these cases the dirac point is ` protected ' by symmetry ; sublattice symmetry breaking leads to gap - opening charge - disproportionated states.@xcite    to identify further promising systems as well as to elucidate the underlying _ design principles _ of functionalities , we have explored systematically the effect of band filling on the electronic ground state in ( 111)-oriented ( la@xmath1o@xmath2)@xmath3/(laalo@xmath2)@xmath4  superlattices , where @xmath1 spans the range of trivalent @xmath5 ions ti - cu . despite the fact that these systems , unlike lao / sto(111 ) , have nonpolar interfaces - i.e. there is no valence mismatch across the interface , so all transition metal cations retain @xmath10 configurations - unexpected phases proliferate .",
    "competition between local pseudocubic symmetry and global trigonal symmetry as well as additional flexibility , provided by the magnetic and spin degrees of freedom of @xmath5 ions , lead to a broad array of distinctive broken symmetry ground states , offering a platform to design 2d electronic functionalities .",
    "moreover , while chern insulators have so far been sought mainly in magnetically doped tis@xcite , or very recently , by combining trivial magnetic insulators with a material with large soc , either in double pervoskites@xcite or rock - salt compounds@xcite , two of our systems display simultaneous time reversal symmetry breaking and soc - driven gap opening .",
    "these are first examples in a solely @xmath5 system with gap sizes large enough to support room - temperature applications .",
    "dft calculations were performed on ( 111)-oriented ( la@xmath1o@xmath2)@xmath3/(laalo@xmath2)@xmath4  superlattices with @xmath11 , using the all - electron full - potential linearized augmented - plane - wave ( lapw ) method , as implemented in the wien2k code  @xcite .",

    "the ( 111 ) bilayering reduces the octahedral symmetry to trigonal and splits the @xmath21 orbital triplet into @xmath22 + @xmath23 , with the former having zero angular momentum around the @xmath24 bilayer axis while the latter orbital doublet forms a representation for @xmath25 angular momentum .",

    "this degeneracy protects the system against the mott insulating gap , presenting a special case of strong correlation effects being rendered ineffectual by an imposed symmetry .",

    "the disparity at k and k@xmath35 signals the loss of equivalence of the two ti ions , reflected in an surprisingly large orbital moment of one of the ions : 0.11@xmath36 versus just 0.01@xmath36 on the other .",

    "a key finding is that a pinning of the dirac point at @xmath38  is not solely determined by band filling , but also by an interplay of orbital and spin degrees of freedom , as proven for the cases of @xmath14mn , co and ni .",
    "equivalence of the two sublattices again becomes crucial .",
    "this symmetry is found to be broken in _ all _ @xmath43  system ground states where the dirac point is initially at the fermi level .",

    "releasing structural symmetry restrictions leads to an elongation of the apical mn - o bond lengths to 2.07 - 2.11   and variation of the basal distances between 1.89 - 1.98  , associated with alternating @xmath47 , @xmath48 occupation on the a and b sublattices ( fig .",
