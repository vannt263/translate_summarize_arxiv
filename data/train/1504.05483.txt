    "the vast majority of the photometric observations carried out on novae at optical wavelengths has been obtained with johnson _ ubv _ and cousins @xmath6@xmath7 photometric systems .",
    "the introduction of @xmath10 equatorial standards by landolt ( 1973 , 1983 , 1992 , 2009 ) , recently expanded to + 50@xmath11 declinations ( landolt 2013 ) , together with the almost exclusive use of ccds as detectors during the last 25 years , has brought more order and uniformity to the photometry of novae . in recent years , the sloan @xmath12 system ( fukugita et al .",
    "1996 , smith et al .",
    "2002 ) is being progressively introduced into leading observing facilities , and the amount of photometry of novae collected with this system is slowly increasing .",
    "common to both the johnson - cousins and sloan systems is the large width of their photometric bands , that trades diagnostic capability with the appeal to reach fainter magnitudes .",
    "novae have very complex spectra , dominated by continuum emission around maximum brightness and by a few very strong nebular lines during advanced decline . as a consequence ,",
    "the astrophysical meaning of photometry collected in the johnson - cousins and sloan systems steadily declines in pace with the decline of a nova from optical maximum , as the percentage of the recorded flux shifts more and more away from continuum and toward a few emission lines .",
    "these emission lines may lie close to the edges of the photometric bands ( expecially true for [ oiii ] 4959 , 5007 and the @xmath4 and @xmath5 bands ) , where small differences from one set of filters to another may spoil completely the possibility to meaningfully combine data on the same nova collected with different instruments .",
    "optical photometry of novae in photometric systems other than @xmath10 is exceedingly rare .",
    "this is not due to the paucity of photometric systems - more than 200 of them are documented in the asiago database of photometric systems ( moro and munari 2000 , fiorucci and munari 2003 ) - but to the unpredictability of nova eruptions .",
    "thus , when a nova erupts , an observer rushes to the telescope ( or places an urgent request for service observing ) and uses whatever photometric device is already mounted and available , usually equipped with the general purpose @xmath13 or @xmath12 filters .",
    "this is even more the case at later times , when observations of the fading nova requires longer integrations and are more diluted in time .",
    "nonetheless , some timid attempts to observe novae in photometric systems other than @xmath14 have been carried out in the past .",
    "the second most used photometric system for general astronomical application has been the _ uvby _ stromgren ( 1956 ) system ( cf the general catalog of photometric data by mermilliod , mermilliod and hauck 1997 ) . at the time of single channel photo - electric photometry , a few novae have been observed in this system , notably nova cyg 1975 ( lockwood and millis 1976 ) and nova cyg 1978 ( gallagher et al .",
    "1980 , kaler 1986 ) .",
    "these pionering attempts soon recognized the value of the stromgren @xmath0 band in tracing the emission in the continuum without contamination by emission lines .",
    "however , these early efforts did not continue into the ccd era , presumably because of the difficulties of manufacturing stromgren interference filters in larger formats and using them in _ converging _ beams instead of the _ parallel _ beams of earlier photo - electric photometers .    in recent years",
    ", classical interference filters has been replaced by far more efficient multi - layer dielectric filters , removing the obstacles in using them with large ccd detectors and fast converging light beams .",
    "consequently , it seems now appropriate to reconsider the stromgren _ uvby _",
    "filters in the context of diagnostic photometry of nova outbursts . in this paper",
    "we present our extensive stromgren _",
    "b , y _ photometry of nova del 2013 , densely and accurately covering the first 500 days of its outburst , in what appears to be - to the best of our knowledge - the best ever recorded stromgren lightcurve for a nova .",
    "the photometry of novae through a narrow filter isolating a single emission line has been even less popular in the past , one such attempt being the photometry of nova del 1967 through an h@xmath2 filter by mannery ( 1970 ) . in parallel with stromgren _",
    "b , y _ filters , we have also followed the evolution of nova del 2013 through narrow filters transmitting h@xmath2 and [ oiii ] 5007   lines .",
    "this paper represents the first actual implementation of the stromgren / narrow - band photometry we initially explored on nova mon 2012 ( munari et al .",
    "2013 ) by integrating the filter transmission profiles on accurately fluxed spectra .",
    "a comprehensive discussion of the performances on novae of stromgren and narrow band filters is postponed to when at least a few additional other novae have been observed through these filters .",

    "the latter found the mean brightness of the progenitor , as recorded on asiago plates exposed between 1979 - 1982 , to be @xmath4=17.27 and @xmath5=17.60 , for a mean color index @xmath16=@xmath170.33 , and measured a mean @xmath4=17.33 from apass observations in 2012 .",

    "pre - maximum spectra showed extremely strong p - cyg profiles on balmer and feii lines , and pure hei aborptions . at the time of optical maximum ,",
    "most of the emission had gone and the deep absorptions reinforced ; only caii h&k and h@xmath2 remained in prominent emission , of similar intensity and flanked by very deep p - cyg absorptions . the first days into decline saw the progressive reduction of absorption lines , and re - emergence of emission by balmer and feii lines .",
    "five days past optical maximum the p - cyg absorptions disappeared from all lines ( except for caii h&k ) , at the time when feii lines peaked in their intensity compared to balmer lines . with passing time the excitation and ionization of the ejecta increased , with hei appearing in emission in september and heii in october 2013 .",

    "we found the difference between the profiles for 2012 and 2014 being negligible , comparable to the small errors of measurements , indicating a good stability and no ( quick ) aging of the filters even if in continuous use at the telescope .",
    "table  2 present a handy summary of the basic parameters of the four filters .",
    "the astrodon @xmath1 and @xmath0 filters show excellent suppression of residual trasmittance away from the main profile , with the exception for the @xmath0 filter of a uv - leak centered at 3275  with fwhm=40   and 4% peak transmission .",
    "given the low atmospheric transmittance , low ccd sensitivity , and absence of prominent emission lines at these wavelengths , such a leak has no practical consequences on photometry of novae .",

    "the shape of the transmittance profile is however quite different : truly flat - topped for astrodon filters with no significant wings , gaussian - like with extended wings for the original stromgren interference filters .",
    "such long wings mean that during the advanced nebular phases , the amount of [ oiii ] emission leaking into the @xmath1 band profile could easily change the measurement by tenths of a magnitude .",
    "the boxy profile of astrodon filters greatly helps in having clean definition of what is transmitted and what is rejected by the filter . in addition",
    ", a nice advantage of astrodon filters is that their dielectric multi - layer type allows peak transmission efficiencies close to perfect 100% , while classical interference filters usually transmit much less than that , requiring proportionally longer exposure times .     and @xmath0 and baader [ oiii ] and h@xmath2 filters.,width=302 ]      the baader [ oiii ] and h@xmath2 filters have high peak - transmission and gaussian - like transmission profiles with extended wings .",
    "the [ oiii ] filter shows a width at half maximum of 70   and it is centered 13    to the red of the rest wavelength of [ oiii ] 5007 .",
    "while this enables the main line of the doublet to be centered close to the filter peak transmission , the other line of the multiplet at 4959   ( whose intensity is about 1/3 of the 5007   one ) lies outside the the main transmission profile and on the wing where the transmission is only 16% of its peak value , causing a rejection of about 21% of the total [ oiii ] doublet flux . the h@xmath2 filter is well centered on the rest wavelength of the emission line and nicely transmits the whole of it .",
    "both baader [ oiii ] and h@xmath2 filters display some leaks away from the main transmission profile , as shown in figure  1 .",
    "the [ oiii ] filter has a near - ir leak at @xmath33@xmath3110,500  , which has no consequence on nova del 2013 photometry given its blue energy distribution .",
    "on heavily reddened novae or novae harboring red giants or novae with particularly strong emission in hei 10830   line , the flux recorded through this leak could however become relevant with respect to that going through the main transmission profile , even considering the minimal sensitivity of optical ccds at such red wavelengths ( @xmath341% ) .",
    "this have been clearly shown in munari & moretti ( 2012 , their figures  1 and 8) for the 2010 outburst of nova v407 cyg , that harbors a very cool mira .",
    "while the nova was declining , the flux of the mira become dominant at the longest wavelengths , and when the energy distribution became redder than @xmath5@xmath17@xmath7@xmath314 mag , the flux going through the similar near - ir leak of old astrodon @xmath4 filters become dominant compared to that going through the filter main profile , resulting in an artificially brighter nova in the @xmath4-band . that near - ir leak has been corrected , and new astrodon @xmath4 filters now offer clean band measurements .",
    "the h@xmath2 filter has no near - ir leak , but it does not accurately suppress the transmission away from the main profile , as figure  1 shows .",
    "over the 7000 - 9000    range its average transmission is 0.17 % .",
    "again , this has no practical consequence on nova del 2013 photometry given its blue energy distribution , the lack of significantly strong emission lines in that wavelength region and the huge intensity of h@xmath2 emission line . to check this , we have integrated the flux through the h@xmath2 filter profile on our very extensive set of accurately fluxed spectra of nova del 2013 that cover its entire evolution , and repeated the computation after forcing to 0.00 the filter transmission everywhere outside the main profile .",
    "the maximum difference between the two sets of measurements amounts to 0.022 mag , for the day of maximum brightness ( and lowest equivalent width of h@xmath2 emission line ) . by the third day",
    "past maximum , the difference has dropped below 0.010 mag , and disappeared below 0.001 mag twenty days past maximum .",
    "on heavily reddened novae or novae harbouring red giants or novae with very strong caii triplet and oi 7772 , 8446   emission lines , the story would probably be different and requires checking on a case by case basis .",
    "inserting interference filters in the converging light beam of a telescopes requires careful evaluation of the effects on the transmission profile .    the wavelength interval transmitted by interference filters shifts toward the blue when",
    "the illuminating beam is tilted away from normal incidence ( 90@xmath11 ) .",

    "stromgren @xmath1 , @xmath0 magnitudes of 18 field stars around nova del 2013 were derived via the transformation equations from apass data published by munari ( 2012 ) . the corresponding h@xmath2 and [ oiii ] magnitudes for these 18 field stars",
    "were derived by a two step procedure .",
    "the magnitudes were first calculated by m(h@xmath2)=@xmath41 and m([oiii])=(@xmath1+@xmath0)/2 , and further checked that these instrumental magnitudes for h@xmath2 and [ oiii ] images were on a normal pogson scale .",
    "secondly , to fix the zero point , we used the dense spectrophotometric monitoring of nova del 2013 that we obtained with the asiago 1.22 m telescope + b&c spectrograph , which will be studied elsewhere . on the absolutely fluxed spectra obtained at nova maximum brightness , and using the filter transmission profiles for f/5.3 we computed the [ oiii ] and h@xmath2 magnitudes , and repeated the computation after removing from the spectra the weak emission and absorption lines present within the filter transmission range",
    "the difference between the two readings fixed the zero point of the transformation scale on the vega scale .",
    "the same 18 comparison stars were used throughout the whole observing campaign ( and in the process continuously checked for absence of intrinsic variability ) .",
    "when the nova was at maximum brightness , they were fainter than the nova and thus required co - adding ( after astrometric registration ) many individual frames ( individually calibrated for bias , dark and flat frames ) to obtain a high s / n on the comparison stars , and the reverse toward the end of the campaign when the nova turned fainter than the comparison stars . even if it was of minimal impact given the narrowness of the filter band pass , all observations were corrected for instantaneous color equations .    the resulting @xmath1 , @xmath0 , [ oiii ] and h@xmath2 photometry of nova del 2013 is given in tables  2 and 3 .",

    "the transmission of the @xmath1 , @xmath0 , [ oiii ] and h@xmath2 filters is overplotted in figure  4 to the spectral evolution of nova del 2013 at some key epochs .",
    "the photometric evolution in @xmath1 and @xmath0 bands is compared to that in @xmath4 and @xmath5 bands in figures 5 and 6 , and the lightcurves in [ oiii ] and h@xmath2 filters are plotted in figure  8 .",
    "the @xmath1@xmath17@xmath0 color evolution is compared to @xmath4@xmath17@xmath5 in figure  7 , and figure  9 focuses on the portion of the lightcurves that cover the period during which super - soft x - ray emission was recorded from nova del 2013 .",
    "as illustrated by figure  4 , the stromgren @xmath0 filter remains remarkably clear of significant emission lines through the whole photometric evolution , especially around maximum brightness and advanced decline , confirming that @xmath0 band is an excellent tracer of the continuum emission of novae . at the time of peak intensity of feii ,",
    "a few weak lines from multiplets 48 ( 5362.9  ) and 49 ( 5425.3 and 5477.2  ) emit within the filter passband , and during early nebular phases weak emission by nii multiplet 63 and the auroral [ nii ] 5577   lines contribute a little to the recorded flux . around maximum , @xmath5 and @xmath0",
    "lightcurves essentially coincide ( including the @xmath152 day plateau described by munari et al .",
    "2013d ) , but as soon as emission lines emerge with a significant flux a few days past maximum , the two lightcurves start to diverge with the @xmath5 band systematically brighter than @xmath0 because of the large flux contributed by h@xmath28 and feii multiplet 42 .",
    "as long as h@xmath28 and feii 42 are the dominant emission lines within the @xmath5 passband , the @xmath5 and @xmath0 lightcurves evolve in parallel with a nearly constant difference in magnitude . when the ejecta finally turn optically thin ( around day + 70 ) , and super - soft x - ray emission from the central wd begins to be observed , the divergence of @xmath5 and @xmath0 lightcurves resumes and continues over the rest of the lightcurve .",
    "when the ejecta turn optically thin ( around day + 70 ) , the rate of photometric decline flattens out considerably at all bands . at this time , the continuum emission observed from the nova is no more dominated by the pseudo - photosphere receding through the ejecta , but by the recombinations in the optically thin ejecta .",
    "initially ( days + 70 to + 100 ) , the recombinations are nearly balanced by the re - ionization induced by the hard radiation emanating from the white dwarf ( in the super - soft x - rays phase ) that now permeates the ejecta , and the brightness in the @xmath0 band remains essentially constant .",
    "later on ( day + 110 and onward ) , the continuing dilution of the ejecta into the surrounding space brings recombinations eventually out of balance with re - ionization , and the @xmath0 band resumes declining",
    ". such decline resumption occurs at later times in the @xmath5 band ( around day + 155 ) , because its bandpass intercepts a large fraction of the increasing emission in the [ oiii ] 4959 , 5007   doublet .",
    "the brightness of the nova in the [ oiii ] filter keeps _ increasing _ throughout the super - soft phase , as the result of the ionization from the central star and the continuous expansion that brings an increasingly large fraction of the ejecta below the critical density for collisional de - excitation of [ oiii ] .",
    "the stromgren @xmath1 band is far more affected by emission lines than the @xmath0 band ( cf figure  4 ) , and it evolves much closer to @xmath4 band ( cf figure  5 ) than @xmath0 compared to @xmath5 . in particular , no plateau soon after optical maximum is observed in @xmath1 , and it is similarly missing in @xmath4 . around maximum brightness ,",
    "nova del 2013 is brighter in @xmath1 than @xmath4 because of the greater density of deep aborption lines in @xmath4 compared to @xmath1 , especially in the bluer part of the @xmath4 passband . as the balmer and feii emission lines begin to reinforce and the absorption weakens , @xmath1 and @xmath4 are first equal and then @xmath1 turns slightly fainter than @xmath4 because no balmer and only a few weak lines from feii multiplets 37 , 38 , 43 and 54 emit within the @xmath1 passband . as for the @xmath0 band with respect to @xmath5 ,",
    "the small offset between @xmath1 and @xmath4 remains stable ( days + 12 to + 45 in figure 5 ) as long as the spectra are dominated by balmer and feii emission lines .",
    "before novae enter the nebular phase , they usually experience the _ niii flaring _ phase ( mclaughlin 1960 ) , during which the 4640   blend of fluorescent excited niii lines greatly increase in intensity , surpassing that of h@xmath30 . because the niii 4640   blend sits entirely within the @xmath1 passband , at the peak of the niii flaring ( days + 60 to + 65 ) the brightness of nova del 2013 in @xmath1 increases and equals the @xmath4 magnitude .",
    "soon after , at the time of the emergence of super - soft x - ray emission and simultaneous flaring of [ oiii ] and decline of niii 4640   blend , the brightness in @xmath1 and @xmath4 bands starts to depart and continue to diverge for the rest of the decline toward quiescence .",
    "this divergence is however much smaller than observed between @xmath0 and @xmath5 bands ( compare figure 5 and 6 ) , with the brightness in the @xmath1 band sustained by heii 4686   emission line in addition to that of niii 4640   blend during the advanced decline .",
    "the photometric evolution of nova del 2013 in the [ oiii ] and h@xmath2 narrow - bands , as depicted in figure  8 , is particularly interesting .    in broad band photometry , soon after maximum brightness , nova del 2013 went through a brief plateau which lasted for @xmath152 days in @xmath5 , @xmath153 in @xmath6 and @xmath154 in @xmath7 ( munari et al .",
    "such a plateau has no counterpart in [ oiii ] and h@xmath2 bands , where the decline started immediately after maximum was reached ( see the first two observing dates on the upper right panel of figure  8) .    around nova maximum brightness , the flux recorded through the [ oiii ] band is essentially that of the continuum , because the strong feii multiplet 42 line at 5018   presents a marked p - cyg profile ( cf .",
    "figure  4 ) , where feii absorption and emission balance each other .",
    "as soon as the p - cyg absorption component vanishes , the nova brightness in the [ oiii ] filter rises above that of the stromgren @xmath0 band recording the adjacent continuum , and remains brighter as long as the feii multiplet 42 stays in emission . with the change to optically thin conditions of the ejecta and the spreading ionization caused by the super - soft x - ray input , the [ oiii ] 5007   emission line rapidly grows in intensity",
    "this causes the brightness in the [ oiii ] band to slow and then to stop the decline ( initial 20 days of the super - soft phase ) , followed by an actual and long lasting _ brightening _",
    "table 4 and figure  9 ) . at the end of the super - soft x - ray phase ( 130 days past it begun ) ,",
    "nova del 2013 is still brighter by 0.2 mag in the [ oiii ] band than before it started .",
    "if confirmed in other novae , this increase and plateau phase in [ oiii ] band brightness could be used to trace the period during which super - soft x - ray emission is present . following the end of the super - soft x - ray phase , the [ oiii ]",
    "band brightness begun to decline , at a very slow rate , slower than in the h@xmath2 band . at the time of the our last observation , on day + 510 , in the [ oiii ] band nova del 2013 was 4.22 mag brighter than in @xmath0 and 2.27 mag brighter than in @xmath5 .    as for [ oiii ]",
    ", the flux recorded around maximum through the h@xmath2 band is essentially that of the continuum , because the strong h@xmath2 line at 6563   presents a marked p - cyg profile ( cf .",
    "figure  4 ) , where again absorption and emission balance each other .",
    "after maximum brightness , the pseudo - photosphere begins to contract inward through the ejecta and to rise in @xmath43 , so that a growing fraction of gas in front of the pseudo - photosphere is ionized , causing a brightening in h@xmath2 band , reaching maximum on day + 16 for nova del 2013 , and remaining on a plateau for about 35 days past the maximum brightness observed in the @xmath5 band ( cf figure  8) . at the time when the plateau ended , nova del 2013 was in the h@xmath2 band 3.6 mag brighter than in @xmath5 , 3.8 mag brighter than in @xmath0 , and 3.5 mag brighter than in the [ oiii ] band .",
    "after the plateau phase , the brightness in the h@xmath2 band began to decline very rapidly ( 0.13 mag day@xmath44 ) , at a speed similar to that of the continuum ( as traced by the stromgren @xmath0 band ) was declining ( 0.12 mag day@xmath44 ) during the h@xmath2 plateau ( cf .",
    "figure  8) .",
    "the post - plateau drop in h@xmath2 brightness coincides precisely with the first appearance of the [ oiii ] 5007 emission line and the niii 4640   flaring .",
    "the rapid drop in the h@xmath2 band was halted by the start of the super - soft x - ray phase , during which the decline in h@xmath2 band proceeded at a much slower rate ( 0.010 mag day@xmath44 ) . at the end of the super - soft x - ray phase , the [ nii ] 6548",
    ", 6584   doublet was already contributing significantly to the brightness of nova del 2013 in the h@xmath2 band , and this contribution increased with time , so that by june / july 2014 nearly all the flux recorded in the h@xmath2 band was coming from the [ nii ] doublet .",
    "once this happened , the brightness decline of nova del 2013 in the h@xmath2 band became slower than that of the [ oiii ] band , and the decline in brightness proceeded in parallel at the same 0.0027 mag day@xmath44 for both the [ oiii ] and h@xmath2 bands .",
    "the extreme smoothness of both the h@xmath2 and [ oiii ] lightcurves argues for absence of large and abrupt discontinuities in the ejecta of nova del 2013 .",
    "should they exist , glitches in the lightcurves would have appeared when the ionization and/or recombination fronts overtook them .      during the early portion of the super - soft x - ray emission phase of novae",
    ", the super - soft flux is frequently seen to vary by huge amounts over short time - scales ( ness et al .",

    "( 2013 ) reported for nova del 2013 variations up to 5 magnitudes ( i.e. 100 times ) from one day to the next in the super - soft x - ray flux recorded during the two - weeks rise toward maximum x - ray brightness , which covers the period of time from day + 69 to day + 86 ( cf .",
    "figure  9 ) .",
    "this effectively corresponds to turning on / off the recorded x - ray emission .",
    "the origin of these large amplitude variations ( lavs ) in the super - soft x - ray flux is not certain , but it has been associated to clumpy ejecta passing through the line of sight or white dwarf photospheric temperature variations .",
    "our photometry in figure  9 obtained during the lavs period of nova del 2013 is particularly accurate and helps to constrain the origin of lavs .",
    "the total error budget of our photometric measurements is much smaller than dot dimensions in figure  9 , as also confirmed by the residuals from low - order polynomial fits to the lightcurves which are of the order of 0.010 mag .",
    "a most relevant feature of the photometry in figure  9 is that there is not even the lightest trace of short term optical variability superimposed to the underlying smooth trend during the lavs period .",
    "this is equally true for narrow - band [ oiii ] and h@xmath2 , for stromgren @xmath1 and @xmath0 and for johnson - cousins @xmath4 and @xmath5 bands .",
    "so no matter if the measurement refers only to continuum radiation , where all the ejecta contribute to the recorded flux ( stromgren @xmath0 ) , or just to a single emission line , where radiation is received only from a single layer of the ejecta ( [ oiii ] and h@xmath2 ) , the x - ray lavs do not extend into the optical .",
    "the presence of lavs during the time interval from day + 69 to day + 86 is simultaneous with the initial growth in intensity of the [ oiii ] 4959 , 5007   lines in the optical spectra .",
    "standard photo - ionization modeling with cloudy shows that in such conditions the [ oiii ] emission originates from a confined region of the ejecta , extending radially for 10%@xmath1720% of the total thickness of the ejecta ( e.g. munari et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the critical electron density for the collisional de - excitation of these lines is @xmath156.8@xmath910@xmath45 @xmath46 ( osterbrock and ferland 2006 ) , which is therefore the electron density of the ejecta or at least of the region producing the [ oiii ] lines when they turn visible .",
    "such an electron density corresponds to a recombination time scale of one week ( ferland 2003 ) .",
    "the fact that lavs seen in nova del 2013 did not impact the brightness of the ejecta by an amount larger than the negligible measurement errors ( of the order of 1% ) , indicates that lavs are not related to global changes affecting the white dwarf as a whole , like the proposed variability of the surface temperature .",
    "should this be the reason for observed lavs , it would imply a parallel large variability of the input of ionizing radiation to the ejecta , whose balance with the recombinations ultimately drives the observed optical brightness of the ejecta . the lavs time scale observed in nova del 2013 is of the order of one day , while the recombination time scale is a week .",
    "the two are sufficiently similar that one would expect to observe at optical wavelengths a counterpart of lavs , which is not seen .",
    "the only feasible possibility is that lavs affect only the x - ray emission directed toward the sun , as with clumpy ejecta passing through the line of sight to us , leaving unchanged the hard radiation input to the ejecta integrated over the 4@xmath47 sky as seen from the white dwarf .",

    "<S> we present and discuss highly accurate photometry obtained through medium stromgren @xmath0 , @xmath1 bands and narrow [ oiii ] , h@xmath2 bands covering 500 days of the evolution of nova del 2013 since its maximum brightness . </S>",
    "<S> this is by far the most complete study of any nova observed in such photometric systems . </S>",
    "<S> the nova behaviour in these photometric bands is very different from that observed with the more conventional broad bands like @xmath3@xmath4@xmath5@xmath6@xmath7 or @xmath8 , providing unique information about extent and ionization of the ejecta , the onset of critical phases like the transition between optically thick and thin conditions , and re - ionization by the central super - soft x - ray source . </S>",
    "<S> the actual transmission profiles of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , [ oiii ] and h@xmath2 photometric filters have been accurately measured at different epochs and different illumination angles , to evaluate in detail their performance under exact operating conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the extreme smoothness of both the h@xmath2 and [ oiii ] lightcurves argues for absence of large and abrupt discontinuities in the ejecta of nova del 2013 . </S>",
    "<S> should they exist , glitches in the lightcurves would have appeared when the ionization and/or recombination fronts overtook them . during the period of recorded very large variability ( up to 100@xmath9 over a single day ) in the super - soft x - ray emission ( from day + 69 to + 86 past @xmath5 maximum ) , no glitch in excess of 1% was observed in the optical photometry , either in the continuum ( stromgren @xmath0 ) or in the lines ( [ oiii ] and h@xmath2 filters ) , or in a combination of the two ( stromgren @xmath1 , johnson @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) . considering that the recombination time scale in the ejecta was one week at that time , </S>",
    "<S> this excludes global changes of the white dwarf as the source of the x - ray variability and supports instead clumpy ejecta passing through the line of sight to us as its origin .    </S>",
